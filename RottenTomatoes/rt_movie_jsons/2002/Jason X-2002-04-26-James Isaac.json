    "summary": "The year is 2455. The Place is Old Earth. Once the shimmering blue jewel of the galaxy, Old Earth is now a contaminated planet abandoned for centuries. Yet humans have returned to the deadly place that they once fled. Not to live, but to research the ancient rusting artifacts of the bygone civilizations that caused this environmental disaster. And little does the most recent landing party of intrepid young explorers realize the fate that awaits them.",

            "content": "Jason X is the tenth film in the slasher film franchise that takes Jason Voorhees, the undead killer who haunts Camp Crystal Lake, to a new location: outer space. The film follows a group of scientists who discover Jason's frozen body in the year 2455 and bring him aboard their spaceship. However, Jason thaws out and resumes his killing spree, while also facing a new enemy: an android named Kay-Em 14, who is programmed to fight him. The survivors must find a way to escape from Jason and the spaceship, which is on a collision course with a space station.\n\nThe film is directed by James Isaac, who also produced the film along with Noel Cunningham. The film stars Lexa Doig, Lisa Ryder, Chuck Campbell, Jonathan Potts, Kane Hodder and others. The film also features the return of Kane Hodder as Jason, who plays the role for the fourth and final time.\n\nThe film is a silly and campy entry in the franchise, as it tries to mix horror and science fiction with mixed results. The film is more comedic and self-referential than the previous ones, but it also has some action and gore scenes. The film is not very original or realistic, but it is fun and enjoyable for fans of the series.\n\nJason X is a cheesy and amusing slasher film that takes Jason to a new frontier and a new century.",

            "content": "I love this movie. I find it to be very underrated and over-hated in my opinion. After the godawful mess that was Jason Goes to Hell, this was actually a lot of fun to watch. I know it isn't a good movie, but it's one of the most re-watchable movies in the franchise, especially when you're with your friends and drinking alcohol. I thought the cast was entertaining, and while the characters weren't super interesting, I feel that they still had a good screen presence. The final girl Rowan was pretty good, but I think there was more that could've been done with her, especially with her being frozen in time with Jason for 455 years at the start of the movie. I think they could've fleshed out her character better in that respect, but otherwise she was pretty badass. It was cool seeing big time horror director David Cronenberg cameo in the movie as a doctor trying to study Jason. I thought the futuristic space setting was a nice change of pace for a franchise that was running on fumes at the time. The Jason in this movie is awesome and a significant step up from Jason Goes to Hell, especially when he is cybernetically enhanced near the end and becomes \"Uber-Jason\". The kills were awesome in this movie as well, with the standout being the liquid nitrogen kill. The ending with Jason plummeting to another Earth, implying that he will start a rampage once again on a new planet is neat too. I think the critics and fans that lambast this movie into the ground are taking it way too seriously. If you are looking for some dumb fun involving Jason in space, this is one of the more fun entries in this franchise and actually my second favorite.",

Though the story happens more than 4 centuries in the future, the characters, a mix of students and Alien-style space grunts, behave and sound remarkably like those horny camp counselors from the 20th century.  The result is the arguably the perfect sequel: the same, only different.  \n\nIn my opinion,  the success of the Friday the 13 sequels,  from around the time Jason discovered his iconic hockey mask, is that the steady drumbeat of low-stakes kills is not all that scary, or even very engaging.  It's just harmless fun.   Im sure the home video market gave it a boost.   You can watch these movies with your friends,  talk during the movies, and no one's going to miss much.\n\nSo this sequel fits right in.  It's objectively bad, but I've willingly watched it at least three times by now.\n\nLisa Ryder is worth mentioning as an unflappable android with a corny sense of humor and a romantic attachment to one of the crew members.   It's the most original thing happening here.\n\nKane Hodder is the best Jason.   As dumb as this movie is, he is perfect as usual.",

Also, aside from Jason, the only character I actually cared about was Sgt. Brodski. The rest I didn't really care. Uber Jason should have appeared more and I wanted at least 5 minutes of Jason vs Brodski.

            "content": "Review: \n\u2018Jason X' is an American slasher film directed by Jim Isaac.  It is the tenth installment in the \u2018Friday the 13th' film series. Why not take the franchise into space? It seems like the most logical step after not being able to create a good film since the first one.\nIn the year 2010, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Government scientist Rowan LaFontaine (Lexa Doig) decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him. A breach is made, and Rowan is frozen alongside Jason for 455 years. Now aboard a ship in the far future they are both regenerated, and Jason continues his killing.\nThis is the tenth film in this series, and it's the 21 Century. Why can we still not get good actors? That's not to say the acting was bad, it was like it is in all of these movies, cheesy but suitable for what the actors are trying to accomplish. It's sad to see Kane Hodder leave after his fourth and final appearance in this film, he is my favorite Jason by far, really bringing this character to new levels.\nI know that this isn't the best movie, and it does have a lot wrong with it realism wise and with continuity. God is it entertaining though! There's so much to love. The claustrophobia of the spacecraft, the tongue in cheek humour, the nerdy aspects of the film's vision. If nothing else, you need to appreciate the boldness in Jim Isaac to do a movie like this.\nOverall, this may just be a guilty pleasure of mine, I know critics hated this one even more than \u2018Friday the 13th: A New Beginning' which I do not understand at all. If nothing else, this movie is so entertaining and true to the character of Jason you can forgive all the cheesy humor and unnecessary scenes that should have been cut. Watch this movie and have fun, that's what it's for.\n3.5/5",

And while there are times when director James Isaac and screenwriter Todd Farmer throw in some irreverent moments, too much of Jason X plays it straight, and that means boredom. Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous. After a brief setup, Jason starts his rampage. One-by-one, the characters are picked off, until, at the end, a plucky heroine or manly hero dispatches him (temporarily). Most of Jason X takes place on a spaceship which to me is wasted opportunity to take the series into better directions (straight camp).",

This movie has arguably the thinnest p[lot to date for any Jason movie. In the beginning, he has finally been captured and those who hold him decide he is to be frozen. Then in a moment of utter stupidity, the government decides to keep him warm and study him.  Once that predictably backfires immediately, he is consequently frozen in a cryostasis chamber with his latest victim also being frozen just outside his tomb. Apparently nobody thought to go in to this building for over 450 years. A scavenger team looking for anything salvageable on the old Earth stumble upon these two. Once on their ship, they repair and revive the woman and begin analysis of Jason. Once again, not thinking about the consequences leads to Jason reeking havoc upon the many people on the ship. The outfits are interesting, though the women wearing extremely revealing clothing throughout the film just seemed like a way for the director to have near nudity since there really was no direct nudity for the crew members. This movie jumbles around trying to make it cool that Jason is in space but it fails to truly capture the magic that could have been Jason in Space. The new Jason that the ship creates haphazardly looks pretty awesome with the metal mask, metal body and demonic eyes. The best death is the first one to occur on the spaceship and the death's get continuously less appealing as the film goes on, including the murder of a female soldier that happens completely off screen but we see the aftermath right after. They even set it up for there to be more Jason movies based on this iteration of the character as he crashes into a lake on Earth-2. This movie could have been amazing if the characters were the kind of people you would actually want to survive or at least not wish death upon.",

In the year 2008 Jason Vorhees (Kane Hodder) is captured by the United States Government....I'm assuming the FBI again, but hey I dunno. Completely ignoring the ending of Jason Goes to Hell -\nThe Final Friday (1993) this Jason looks more like the older Jason of the third and fourth films. I digress. Anyways, a scientist named Rowan (Lexa Doig) insists they put Jason into a cryogenic frozen slumber. As in most movie this doesn't work and everyone is killed except for Rowan and Jason. Rowan tricks Jason into the machine, but is stabbed in the process. Fast forward 445 years later to the year 2455 and a group of Students led by a man named Professor Lowe (Jonathan Potts) discover Jason and Rowan perfectly preserved. In the future the Earth is a barren wasteland and no one lives there anymore apparently. Well they Revive Rowan and of course Jason comes back wrecking havoc and murdering all the horny students one by one. And boy do I mean horny this movie literally feels at time like a softcore porno. That mixed with the incredibly shitty acting and low production makes for a very hard watch. There's really no positive to this film other than Jason looks very creepy in this one, but this is a movie to avoid at all costs.",

Following in the hallowed footsteps of Leprechaun 4, Hellraiser: Bloodline and Critters 4, this installment finds Jason cryogenically frozen for four hundred years and defrosted aboard a lightly-staffed spacecraft. No explanation is offered for his abrupt return from the depths of the nether, where he was unceremoniously dumped at the end of Jason Goes to Hell, though I'm not sure that really would've made a difference. This is a willfully stupid playground for half-baked science fiction ideas, terrible wardrobe choices and budget special effects; a cut-rate production that would feel right at home on the Sci-Fi Channel at 3am. Predictable to the end, it touches all the bases with gratuitous nudity, shallow characters, mysterious returns from certain doom and a truckload of dismemberments / decapitations / deaths. The only thing we're missing is the trademarked screeching cat fake-out, presumably because no self-respecting animal would be seen in such a production. Apart from one fleeting moment of self-deprecating parody near the end - which is totally out of place, but admittedly had me howling - there's no reason for this to exist. It's the kind of thing that would've thrived on the bootleg circuit, akin to Roger Corman's unreleased Fantastic Four, but by actually sending it to theaters, New Line took the wind out of those sails.

The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off.\n\nDue to the location and incorporating space and sci-fi, on top of all the expected 'Friday the 13th' elements then some, 'Jason X' is certainly different and a little credit is due for that. For a 'Friday the 13th' film it and 'Jason Takes Manhattan' are pretty unique as far as the series goes. 'Jason X' is an example of different not really being a good thing.\n\nInteresting idea and understand totally what the film was trying to do, but it was messily executed. The strengths and faults are pretty much the same as with the previous entry 'Jason Goes to Hell', excepting 'Jason X' is marginally better because it tried to be different.\n\nA couple of creative and disturbing deaths and some inventive and stylish camera work lift 'Jason X' to a better level.\n\nOne good performance too, which comes from Kane Hodder. Again creeping and chilling the socks off the viewer as Jason.\n\nHowever, those are the only praises really that can be given. The music is a little appealing on the ears, but it still doesn't have the eeriness and mystery that the pre-'Jason Goes to Hell' films had so brilliantly and doesn't fit as adeptly.\n\nThat is the least bad though of the drawbacks, which are pretty much the same as those of the worst 'Friday the 13th' films but even worse than before. Again, like 'Jason Goes to Hell', while a good deal of 'Friday the 13th' films are silly, the silliness here is overkill that it becomes insultingly ridiculous. 'Jason X' is one of the most unique conceptually of the series, but it sure is one of the strangest to the point of overdone weirdness.\n\n'Jason X' tonally feels muddled and like it was trying to do too much with too many elements screaming of kitchen-sink. If it tried to do less it would perhaps have been a better film. Hodder aside, the acting is really horrendously amateur hour, even for the 'Friday the 13th' films where acting rarely was a strength.\n\nLikewise with the dialogue, which is even worse than 'Jason Goes to Hell', with 'Friday the 13th' at its most taking-simplicity-to-extremes, stilted, cheesiest and lacking in taste. Scariness and suspense is nil, instead going for witless comedy and gratuitous gore and nudity. The deaths go for quantity rather than quality, and generally are not particularly imaginative or creepy. The story is paper thin and confused, with too hectically paced storytelling and there is the sense that the series has gotten really stale even with a change in location.\n\nOverall, lame. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

What i love about these movies is that they can truly lay claim to being the most shamelessly ridiculous horror movie franchise ever, it's great fun to see them constantly \"go there\", and in this one you get such ludicrous pleasures as Jason running round a spaceship raking up body count, fighting a Terminator/The Matrix style leather clad, heavily armed android girl, getting cryogenically frozen and unfrozen in the 24th century and getting turned into a super mechanized version of himself (with a shiny new metallic hockey mask)  by nanobot's.

            "content": "After \"Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday\",there wasn't another \"Friday the 13th\" film for years and \"Freddy vs.Jason\" was put into development after the ending of the last film hinted at the idea.However,the film was in development hell for years and we finally got the film in 2003.However,we got a sequel to \"Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday\" the year before called \"Jason X\" which needless to say felt like a big cash grab.\n\n\"Jason X\" stars Lexa Doig,Kane Hodder,Lisa Ryder,Chuck Campbell,Jonathan Potts,and Peter Mensah and the film is directed by James Isaac.\"Jason X\" begins in the year 2008 where Jason is somehow alive after being dragged into hell in the previous film.He's in a testing facility in Camp Crystal Lake in which he starts killing people.However,he is cryogenically frozen and he is found 445 years later and brought onto a ship in which he starts to kill the crew.The plot of the movie is stupid.You can tell the writers didn't have anything to do so they gave this film the \"Hellraiser:Bloodline\" and \"Leprechaun 4:In Space\" treatment and put Jason in space.Needless to say,it sucked.\n\nThe acting in \"Jason X\" is atrocious even by \"Friday the 13th\" standards.The only good actor in the movie is Kane Hodder as Jason.This would be the last time Hodder would play Jason and he did a good job here.Jason certainly had more screen time here than he did in the previous film.Before I talk about how bad this movie is,there is one other good thing in the movie and that is the death scenes.The kills are decent,but there's one that really sticks out.When Jason wakes up,he kills a female scientist by freezing her head in liquid nitrogen and then smashes her face on the counter.It's definitely one of the best kills in the whole \"Friday the 13th\" series.\n\nThe characters in this movie are terrible.There is no likable character in the whole film and you root for Jason to kill these people the whole movie.The writing is terrible as well.For a \"Friday the 13th\" film,this is the most poorly written film in the series.The dialogue is corny and it'll make you roll your eyes.The effects are also awful.This was the first film in the series to have CGI  and it looks like something off a Sega Saturn game.It looks so cheap.The design for Jason is bad as well.As the end,Jason gets an upgrade and turns into Uber Jason and the design is laughable.It looks like something a ten year old would come up with.The comedy is this film is cringe inducing.This film has a lot of comic relief in it and it's unbearably bad.The final thing I hated about \"Jason X\" was the ending.I won't say what happens,but it's so cheesy and stupid.\n\nOverall,this is the worst film in the series.Besides Kane Hodder and the kills,everything in this movie is terrible.The story is stupid,the characters suck,the writing is terrible,the effects are awful,Jason's design is bad,the comedy is unbearable,and the ending is terrible.The only reason it was made was to hold over the fans of \"Friday the 13th\" until \"Freddy vs.Jason\" came out.It's a terrible movie,but I will say if you want to watch a bad movie that is hilarious watch this movie.As a hardcore fan of the series,this was painful.\n\nGrade:D",

            "content": "We've hit the reset button yet again. Jason X is another one-off entry in the series which largely ignores what came before and changes things so much that no film picked up where it left off. Horror sequels tend to function ineffectively in a vacuum and Jason X is no exception, it's a tough watch.\n \nI never realized it before but in many ways this film is a futuristic remake of Jason Takes Manhattan. Think about it, most of the action takes place on a ship, Jason is surrounded by undergraduates, there's a professor/student seduction scene, Jason's makeup is lacking, and it's all god-awful rubbish. I don't understand the thinking here. The last two films took Jason away from camp and both were huge failures with the fan base, how can you make this mistake a third straight time? \n \nOnce again I'll state the obvious: Jason in space is a dumb idea. I've heard this film described as \"Jason for the Matrix generation\" and maybe that's true. Jason X was built around a futuristic aesthetic using all sorts of CGI shots of space flight and sci-fi weaponry and, you know what, who cares? Since when did people watch these films for the digital effects? The answer is never. The filmmakers even go so far as to create an android character who looks like Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity and include a rapid-cut fight scene with her and Jason near the end of the film. The idea that an audience member would be thrilled or entertained by this makes me ill.\n \nMuch like Jason Goes to Hell this film comes off as more of an action-focused production and doesn't much bother with suspense or scares, not even cheap ones. A good example of this would be the second act which involves a team of trained commandos tracking Jason through a spaceship like in Alien. Of course their expertise is wasted on the stealthy Jason who, despite being bulky and rancid smelling, can sneak up on anyone at any time and slash his way out of the situation. It's a dull charade.\n \nI find it interesting that, although they were all major studio releases, Friday the 13th films are often thought of as B-movies. Jason X is probably the closest any of these sequels come to actually fulfilling that expectation. Poor costuming, set design, and visual effects make Jason X a film that generates groans and eye rolls as often as ironic laughter. It's another tedious, uninspired sequel in what has quickly become a marathon of unwatchable dreck.",

The acting is nothing to write home about and as usual, it's Kane Hodder's imposing presence as Jason that is the best performance.

Obvious problem number 1 is the story. Jason in space is a change up but a desperation one. Most of the time i'm not even sure that its a future or space-ish setting. All of the cast cloths look like they're going out on a Saturday night, not on a space ship in 2455. Oh yeah they keep saying one character was frozen for OVER 445 years, but its exactly 445 years. It may sound like a pet peeve but that really pisses me off. It makes some bad one liners and obvious jokes. It tries to be over-the-top but its still takes itself serious and that never works. The suspense isn't really there, its more action and it feels wrong. Jason get resurrected and looks absolutely ridiculous. The cast is nearly forgettable. Lisa Ryder and Kristi Angus were the only two characters that were any fun but the rest of the cast pulls them down to their level of badness. The special effects are so poor they're actually laughable. \"Jason X\" is defiantly the lowest point in the \"Friday the 13th\" series and one of the worst films i've experienced in quite a while.",

I saw this movie late at night on Netflix and thought I would give it a watch. I don't think this movie was meant to be taken seriously....\n\nLets face it, when people are out of ideas, they go into weird places like Space... Other movies like Dracula 3000, Leprechaun in Space and things like that were unnecessary and dumb. This movie fits right with them.\n\nI remember that night, shortly after watching it, I looked up why this was made. It turned out that they wanted to spew out a Jason film in cinemas for a filler before Freddy vs Jason came out. So I'm just spitballing here but... I think they just had one guy say \"Oh, lets put him in space for no apparent reason! DURHUR!\"\n\nSeriously?! Why Space?! I understand trying to get something fresh and new out but at least be more original then just space! It totally confuses us for how it links to Freddy vs Jason (if it was even counted as being in the series unless they realized they were stoned coming up with this and then found out it was a bad idea so they just tried to cover it up.)\n\nI don't want to get into detail about this movie because its no oscar or memorable film. Lets just say everyone involved wanted your money. Acting was bad, Story is dumb, Characters are unlikable, SFX are cheese but.... There are just a few positives to this\n\nSome of the kills are pretty decent and Cyber Jason was pretty cool looking. That's about it and it actually redeemed a star for that... \n\nOverall, Jason X is a silly, stupid movie. I would only watch it if there is absolutely nothing on tv and you have nothing to do on a late night. Other than that, avoid it at all costs.",

            "content": "Okay, pop quiz: What could make Jason Voorhees go from a high-ranked horror icon to a jerk-off horror whore? Everything that they did in this movie.\n\nWhile I like how James wanted to change the setting from Crystal Lake and appeal more to the science fiction genre rising in the early 2000's (The 6th Day, Mission to Mars, X-Men, etc.) but the way he did so is nothing short of cliche. As a fan of the classic horror icons, I felt that this would be a game changer in the genre of futuristic horror but I was sadly mistaken. What Jason X basically did was take an already immortal killer, put him in a Star Trek ship decked out in chrome, and then made him more immortal and even harder to kill than in the last dozen films he was in before. All in all, Jason X was just an excuse to whore out both Jason and the science fiction genre in one nice little film, if you could call it that. Instead of adapting Jason to his new, futuristic world, they kept him as the blade-wielding undead killer he was before only they decked him in chrome and armor, made his 20-times stronger than he should be, and gave him interesting new knives to play with and the ability to regenerate. Other than that, this was basically same, old Jason in the same scenario as in any Friday the 13th film except set in a spaceship completely isolated from Earth instead of the typical camp by the lake.\n\nAll in all, Jason X is basically taking Friday the 13th, putting it on a spaceship, decorate it in chrome, and decking out Jason to make him even harder to kill. Saying now, if you're looking for a new take on sci-fi/horror and your considering this film to add to your list. Turn back now, you are making a grave mistake.",

Jason is still super pissed off even though he gets a complete upgrade due to a great tissue reconstruction machine that pimps him up better than if he had spent a month with X-Zibit and his crew on Pimp My ride! anyways the film is filled with references to the previous film of the franchise, the tone is slightly comedic and the film feel rather like a cheap action space flick than a real horror outtake. The franchise started great with Sean S. Cunnigham in the directing seat, Steve Miner kept things ok for the sequel but went pretty awol with the third episode. After that it's been constant non sense, grotesque and incredibly uninteresting plot stories mere excuses for an insane amount of body count and other rather interesting death by the boogeyman. Jason X shows some interesting ideas but overall it's pretty bad and lacking any real artistic value or interest. It's really too bad that Horror in the United States is perceived as something so cheap. Other cultures such as the Japanese one manage to create horror movies that have good stories and great thrills. The genre need a complete turn over and a much needed resurrection in the land of uncle Sam.... I am curious to see which film is going to bring back from it's ashes a great genre that has fallen into complete disgrace for the last 20 years.",

This movie just didn't bring the amount of hamminess or cheesiness that I was looking forward too. I think the main is was 'Attack of the Killer tomatoes' syndrome. Folks go in to making a 'so bad it's good' movie intentionally but miss what makes those kinds of films enjoyable. This is the only one where I was nodding off. There was only one victim that I cared about( hell, cant even remember his name). The rest were either bland or kind of terrible people.  There is a very lack luster fight scene which could have been good but wasn't handled well. None of the kills were memorable. Well, one kind of was but it was while Jason was in a simulation and was copying a previous gem so that hardly counts. The only reason I am giving this nothing less than a 2 is that it at least had Jason, in space, killing folks. No matter how poorly it handled, it at least did it. You could have been so much more movie, so much more. Oh, and I was going to give it a 2.5, but then Uber-Jason. Ya, the less said about that the better. Just, ew.",

With a story that's so stupid that it has to be seen to be believed, the film satirizes the sci-fi and horror genres.  In the year 2455 Jason Voorhees is found in cryostasis by an archaeology team and taken aboard their spaceship bound for Earth 2, but when Jason awakens the killing spree begins.  The acting is awful and the special effects are atrocious.  But it all adds up to that special kind of bad that's entertaining to watch.  A campy B-movie, Jason X is so absurd and over-the-top that it's actually a bit of fun.",

Also the bit at the beginning when Jason is searching for the woman in that complex, the footsteps are literally silent, that's stupid. The music should have been more futuristic, should have thrown in some synthesizers or something. I like it when the woman says \"We even hung him once\" i think that was a reference to part 3. The dialogue was awful and the scene when the woman grabs the guy's shoulder was atrocious! there was no build up whatsoever, it instantly cuts to her grabbing his shoulder...were we supposed to be scared by that?! that was horrific!

The story takes place in a creatively devoid future, but the story is still stuck in the freakin' past. All the cliches are here: the stupid characters, the couple who's always screwing, the indestructible killer, and everything in between! There's nothing new here! The only good thing about this movie is that it makes fun of the formula of its predecessors. This would actually be pretty cool if the movie itself actually differed from the movies it was making fun of. It's just kind of shitting on itself at that point.

While some of the others were just bad, and not all that funny or gory, this one is bad, but hysterical. There are some genuinely funny jokes, some extremely bizarre moments, and some parts where it is so unrealistic it makes you smile. As usual the deaths are the focus, and they are up to a good standard, but nothing amazing. Right away when I read the general idea of the movie I expected it to be bad, and it was. The plot actually had some potential to work I will admit, but it really fell flat. The dialogue and characters are also flat. I am also not much of a fan of the new look, it just isn't Jason to me.

It is a perfect movie to watch if you have never seen any of the previous entries as it only briefly mentions past events and the story doesn't really follow on from any of the previous movies.  Jason has changed as well, and is no longer referred to as a zombie and now is classed as a man with super regenerative powers!  The story is just so outlandish that it borders on the ridiculous, but it is so well acted and directed that it becomes a huge piece of cheese in all the right ways with a prefect mix of action, horror and comedy.  The characters all stand out and finally veer away from the generic slackers that have featured in a lot of the previous entries, and it is always a pleasure to see Kane Hodder returning as Jason.  The special effects are top notch and the deaths are as over the top as you have come to expect.  When all is said and done, this is a great little 'beer and popcorn' movie and a worthy entry in the much loved franchise.",

When Jason enters the virtual reality room towards the end. Even David Cronenberg makes an amusing cameo in the opening sequence. Intentionally funny, most of the time although Todd Farmer (My Bloody Valentine-2009, Drive Angry) is no comedy writer. Since his original script was more darker and more violent in tone. Some good moments, here and there. Despite some serious flaws, some fans hated the goofy tone of the movie but once you set Jason in space, what can you do? Just accept as a campy horror movie and have fun with it. Most of the canadian cast are quite likeable. This is good, guilty pleasure fun! Hodder is good as always as Jason.",

I would also say this is the funnist in the series, though the voilence has dumbed down a bit, there are some cool, original death scenes but then again, as it's set in space, anything's possible. The sight of seeing Jason being reanimated is a strange delight, seeing him slick and updated makes him a true killer. The worst thing about this is again, the acting, except for Lexa Doig as Rowan, who is pretty good but only noticable because the rest are rubbish. Jason gets a futuristic makeover and annihilates someone using a giant screwing tool. After sitting through Jason's latest exploits, the audience may find itself identifying with that victim in particular. As far as the Friday series goes, this is more fun than anyone had any right to imagine. Not a bad sequel and you can watch this without having seen the other sequels, which I recommend you do, to be honest.",

Most people would contend that the idea of sending Jason into the future and space could very well be the worst idea in the history of the series. Well, that's not totally inaccurate. I had the same reaction when I first heard about it. It's actually very well-made, and much more engaging and interesting than the previous three sequels (especially Jason Goes to Hell). There isn't much in the way of standard Friday the 13th story fodder either. There's no one with deep psychological problems trying to defeat Jason, no gratuitous sex or nudity scenes and there's no sense of suspense or build-up to it anymore. Why is that a good thing? In this context, these films are so played out that a sequel that tries to be genuinely suspenseful would just fall flat on its face. This film is having fun with the series, and it shows. Hell, they even have a scene that pays homage to The New Blood when Jason walks into a holodeck-type area and is made to believe that there are a couple of teenagers looking to party and have sex. He immediately bashes them while they're in their sleeping bags, and the entire scene is funny and enjoyable. They also have a similar scene earlier in the film where Jason walks into the same area and thinks he's killed one of the main characters, just to find that it was all a computer simulation. He immediately afterwards kills the character for real. There's also a bit of set up and pay off, or even building up the reality of the film. Early on, when they first discover Jason's frozen corpse, he's accidentally knocked over and cuts off one of the character's arms. Causing little to no fuss, they use a futuristic method of cauterizing the wound, bring the severed arm with them, and re-attach it on the ship. It seems frivolous but it actually sets up that these people have the technology to combat things like severed limbs or damaged tissue. It also sets up the nanobots table, which are little mechanical spiders that are used to bring the frozen lead actress back to life, repairing damaged tissue in the process. It's also, of course, used to the enth degree with Jason later in the film. This is also another entry where everybody knows about Jason early on, which I like. In all actuality, there's no way to really do a sequel to this series (or a remake, for that matter) without it being laughed at and looked down on. It's when the filmmakers have a passion for it and try to do something creative and fun with it that it's most effective, which is the case with Jason X.",

The acting is not all that, and they even have a ten cent version of William Shatner to round out the cast, but it is cool seeing an Asian actress in the lead. The climax is beyond dumb when Jason gets regenerated into Uber Jason, but he does look intimidating as hell.

With the Halloween franchise laying dormant until the late 80's, the ruler of this genre was Jason Voorhees. But while the Friday The 13th franchise cranked out movies nearly once a year throughout the 80's, they stopped being scary in 1984 with Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter, which was supposed to be the end of the series.\r\n\r\nAfter The Final Chapter, the series shifted gears and went from making Jason the monster you feared, into the hero you rooted for. You no longer hid in fear over how Jason would dispatch his victims. Instead you couldn't wait to see it. They became more party movies than horror movies. They didn't even try to scare you. I have to believe that this was intentional. It's what the audiences wanted. The filmmakers couldn't outgrow the cliches they themselves had created, so they embraced them, and amped up the overkill. Literally.\r\n\r\nWith this movie, the filmmakers had to know how utterly ridiulous the premise was. \"Jason In Space\" is something that would be laughed off the screen if they tried to take it seriously. Thankfully, they did not. It's a campy sci-fi movie with it's tongue so firmly planted in its cheek, that it threatens to punch right through.\r\n\r\nThe characters are as wafer thin as they ever have been. Except these teens of the future are horny young scientists on a futuristic field trip to \"old Earth\", instead of horny summer camp counselors. When they discover the cryogenically frozen body of Jason, and the uber-hot scientist accidentally frozen with him, they take the bodies back aboard their ship, thaw them out, and that party really gets started.\r\n\r\nKane Hodder returns for his fourth, and final appearance as Jason. Hodder's hulking form has served the character well, and he is the person that has given Jason the most personality over the years. Here he once again gladly dispatches of those pesky young people in both his classic, machete wielding ways, and in new ways that are provided by the sci-fi setting.\r\n\r\nThere are many funny lines and references to past Jason outings throughout the movie. A virtual reality Camp Crystal Lake segment is especially fun. Some classic kills are re-created with a sick humorous twist, and and unwitting victim delivers one of the great lines of the franchise \"It's ok guys, he just wanted his machete back.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a movie that totally divided the Friday The 13th fanbase. It's so far removed from the original creation that, to some, it bordered on blasphemy. But you have to judge it on it's own merits. Is it scary? Hell, no. But I don't believe it was ever intended to be. It was meant to be fun roller coaster ride with familiar happenings in an unfamiliar setting. It's a popcorn movie, and a fun one at that.",

The horribly written characters of this film basically translate into The Breakfast Club in space with Jason.  Yes, that's right: in space.  And did I mention that it is 450 years in the future?  Let me save you some time - Jason is on a spaceship with a bunch of people from the future and he kills all of them.  I really wish that I was making this up.  If the horrible concept wasn't enough, this film is filled with absurd one-liners that place the film in limbo somewhere between comedy and slasher film.  When you use the line \"He's screwed\" to describe a character who was killed by falling onto a giant drill, you know that the writers are just making fun of the film.  Did I mention that it takes place in space?  The only redeeming quality (and I use that term very loosely) is the casting of Lexa Doig, who is VERY nice to look at.  But what is the point when you keep on shooting something at close range and he just gets back up and kills you?  If there is no realistic (or even unrealistic) way to kill the villain, the plot disappears and you are left with 90 minutes of a guy in a hockey mask killing a bunch of people and then some closing credits.  It isn't even scary because the idea of Jason running around on a spaceship is so ludicrous.  Oh yeah, by the way, they are in space.  \"Jason X\" is laughable and truly a testament to the fact that the writers have given up on this film franchise and decided that the only way to make any more money off of it is by turning it into a joke.  It certainly has fallen a long way since the 80's.  And just to warn you, this movie takes place in outer space.",

I wouldn't be surprised if they just popped in royalty free music CD. All of the kills are hack and slash and there's only a single memorable one, which isn't even that good if you've seen Terminator 2. The computer generated effects of the kills and the spaceships are awful; I've seen Sega Genesis games that look better. It's scare and startle-free and you will forget the name of any character mere seconds after someone says it. Even as a comedy, this movie fails horribly. The one mildly amusing part with the sleeping bag \"death\" wont register a laugh because you're pissed off at the rest of the movie. I haven't seen every Friday the 13th movie, but I bet you the rest of them feel like they're part of a series. Jason X is like Highlander: The Source to the Highlander franchise; yes, it has the brand name and a minimum of one recognizable character, but it's incredibly lousy and pisses on its fans. And I'm not even a fan of the series, so I can't imagine how infuriated fans of this movie were when they saw it!

There's nothing on the level of suspense because we've seen the movie before, the first 9 times it was done and guess what it sucked then too. I love how the makers of these movies think anyone gives a flying fuck about Jason. There's nothing scary about a retard who won't die.\n\nJason X is definitely the worst idea in the franchise, but the sum total is a little more watchable then Jason Goes to Hell and Jason Takes Manhattan. I'd probably rank this as the third worst in the series. But it did give the viewers some valuable information for the future. One is that hockey is going to be outlawed in about 30 years. So everyone in North Dakota better get their hockey on hard for the next few decades. Another is that the future intergalactic researchers are going to be stupid, hot chicks with nice perky breasts, which means, we're fucked.\n\nThere's nothing about this movie that can be considered entertaining.

That is an idea that when properly executed could've resulted in a brilliantly shlocky and hilariously entertaining film, but instead Jason X opts to just suck. Most of the characters all share one personality, by which I mean they have none beyond throwing out sarcastic one-liners, and ninety-five perfent of the jokes fall flat, leaving the only kinda funny parts to be the sometimes pretty entertaining kills. But even with a few kinda cool kills, the film never really utilizes the possibilities of putting Jason in the future on a spaceship, and instead just does a typical Friday the 13th slasher. The setting has no significant impact on the action, so basically the same movie could've been done as a classic Friday the 13th film by just replacing words like \"space\" in the script with \"Camp Crystal Lake\". Honestly the idea of Jason in space would've been much more suited for a splatter film than a slasher film. When the movie came out I was like ten years old and was too young to see it, so when I saw the trailer I just imagined the movie in my head, and I still find the one ten-year-old me came up with better than the actual one. They should've just gone all out and given Jason like a laser machete and had him have a lightsaber duel or something and give all the characters blasters and shit... You know, just go all out on the stupid sci-fi shit like something like Moonraker did (although granted that's not a good movie either). In the end the only thing Jason X truly got right is Uber Jason which is one of the coolest things ever in the history of anything ever.\n\n5-/10",

Yell-o, Sleaze Boy blasts into space to look for neon Jason in Jason X. \r\n\r\nJason X \r\nIt's been a while since Jason has been seen in Jason Goes to Hell, but now his time is done and returns to earth to participate in a space program. Jason X is a bad, bad movie. It's better than New Blood or Jason Takes Manhattan in acting and spirit wise, but it surpasses stupidity than both of those films. The flick is clumsy beyond redeeming bounds or value. It's incompetent, inept, insipid, gloriously moronic, and a lot more. Did I mention it's incredibly stupid by a new record? The film suffers from the obvious bad writing, characters, plot, development, cinematography, suspense, and logic, but suffers with bad special effects and that takes a toll. The special effects have always meant something in Friday the 13th flicks as we gather up to see a new way of slashing, stabbing, dicing, and other deaths. However, here the CGI is fairly obvious that a preschooler can tell the obvious cheapness and have, for whomever, memories back to the 50's when two paper plates with strings were used for flying saucers. \r\n\r\n2010 \r\nThe film opens up in 2010 as Jason is held captive by a small military unit with commanding officers and team of scientist bent on using him despite scientist Rowan's objection. They visit to transport him, but are killed off when Jason breaks free. Rowan, the final girl, reacts quickly by defeating Jason in placing him in a capsule to be cryogenically frozen. Victory, apparently not, is cut or stabbed when Jason pierces Rowan from leaving out the door. The two are frozen. \r\n\r\n2455 \r\nThe frozen bodies are discovered after a group of students with an accompanying professor. They find Jason first, and we learned that hockey has been outlawed for some odd reason, goodbye dentist. Anyways, the students find Rowan and take both of them to a spaceship, but not before its accidents. Anyways, we go to the spaceship and learn it is filled with sex crazed students running around having fun. I can't remember if any of them were doing drugs, but that's not the point. Among unfreezing the two, the chaos begins. I was amazed that stupidity flourishes throughout the future. We begin with Professor Lowe as he is told by a financial adviser that human from the past is worth a lot of money. However, the killer Jason Voorhees is worth a lot more. I am guessing the financial backer has seen some of the Friday the 13th films. Wanting to profit, Lowe has Jason unfrozen despite Rowan's objection and once again, chaos ensues. I cannot remember who, but Jason wakes up as female scientist Adrienne has her back turned and echoes of sadomasochism. This scene is amusing as it is tasteless.  Anyways, Jason wakes up delivers the first and best kill since 445 years as he holds Adrienne's face in liquid nitrogen and smashing her face in bits. \r\n\r\nNow that Jason has been brought back to life and ready to slash, I am going to make ephemeral talking about what goes on next. The crew is unaware of Jason, so it allows us to relax and enjoy the insightful view of stupidity and death. Students and staff are picked off one by one as they commit all the errors that lead to death in a slasher film. There is an attempt of resistance as a number of folks with brief personalities battle Jason only to die. I guess they did not receive the memo of Jason's ability to regenerate loss skin tissue or damage. Anyways, folks are picked off one by one as they wander around in the dark yelling out names. It is no surprise. Anyways, we get the whole \"Ten Little Indians\" concept as it boils down to the final girl, but I was surprised as the flick took a few positive turns. A handful of people make it out alive only to learn the spaceship is damaged and ready to blow up. There is an improvement around here when battle takes place between Jason Voorhees and a sexy android known as the KM-14. The battle scene is loaded with laughs and excitement that doesn't save the flick. The film looks like it's clear for ending, but another twist appears. This twist is ludicrous outstretching the flick until the ending secured, uneven. Jason has landed on Earth 2, kill-k-kill. \r\n\r\n2011/present \r\nI return to the first paragraphs the film's flaws as it is pervasive. I could go on with a large list enough to be a single roll of toilet paper, but that will be boring. The necessity to get intricate in criticism is not required because the intelligence and structure is frivolous. Its absurdity and sullen style can be spotted within the opening. However, a Jason flicks have always perverse itself with a dark sense of humor overtime, so I forgive it on that part. At this moment, I flurry into the film's positive. Its triumph relies in vulgarity and stupidity. They mesh together and polish the film near it's so bad it's good. There's a great cheap scene with the ship colliding with a station known as Solaris. Awfulness is pretty funny throughout including two gaudy scenes that's a new record in my book. I cannot describe it completely as I am tempted to tell you watch the film or spoil all. However, I can allow hints and winks when we see KM-14's envy during one scene and two sexy girls' valiant resistance and mutual endeavor with Jason. Indeed, this fun and humorous if you are tolerant to this behavior. I could only have hoped for a brief romanticism in the flick. Aesthetic meets schlock in bowl of blood with limps floating. An attempt to bring a sort of innocence to the young adults in the spaceship as crew and staff bite their nails. Added correctly with writing, direction, and mood, the film would have made an adult feel like a kid. I admit I found myself in this position. It is sad, however, that I must return from fantasy to finish this flick. \r\n\r\nWe are left with a too long journey as the flick tries to be serious at times with eclectic elements from better flicks. The list is not long, but I thought the following: Alien (A), Blade Runner, Hellraiser: Bloodline (D-), and 2001: A Space Odyssey (A) just to name a few. I can't recall if I saw any Star Wars or Star Trek influences. Anyways, we get themes from the flick, and it is unable to transform itself. Better yet, there is no clear visual to what the film wants to be. Are we supposed to get a scary film gone wrong or is this was an attempt to make a campy and silly flick with optional variation. The weigh questions burdens down the ship. There's trouble with the engine! The cinematography ruins the picture as hinted the use of a cheap digital recording camera. The engine is burning! I was offended by the sight of bad CGI as I began to ponder the comparison between this and legendary Ed Wood films. Okay forget the fire, the engine is gone! I could forgive a bad film if it is pretty funny Texas Chainsaw Massacre- the Next Generation, but Jason X misses, ah!, the mark, squeal, for a recommendable, gah!, opinion, agh!. Yet, I cannot dismiss it, phew.  I enjoyed the documentary The Many Lives of Jason Voorhees and some other cool special features, but it is not enough for mainstream audience to watch. Jason fans will and the opinion will be mixed. \r\n\r\nOther notes: you know a movie is in trouble when fame critic like Roger Ebert uses the word \"suck\" in a review. I understand why original director of Friday the 13th Sean Cunningham produced this flick, but he should have stayed patient or keenly aware of the film. The senescent Jason has shown no sign of retiring.\r\n\r\nFlick written by Todd Farmer and directed Jason Isaac.",

I know your laughing there at that first bit but its true, and i was dissapointed not because the film was flat out bad, but because i didn`t get scared...at all.\r\n\r\nFinally captured in the year 2008, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is held inside a government research facility whose scientists try to answer the question that keeps eluding them - why one of the most infamous mass murderers in history cannot die. Once Rowan (Lexa Doig), leader of the research project, prepares the specimen for cryogenic suspension, a greedy scientist goes over her head and comes to remove Jason, only to have the mad slasher break free and slaughter him and his entire entourage. Tricking Jason into following her, Rowan eludes him into entering the cryogenic freezer and begins the process, but a breach in the system causes her to freeze with him. The government tries to deny any evidence of the project, and nearly four centuries pass, during which the Earth gradually becomes less and less habitable and humans have relocated to a planet in another star system that they've named Earth II. A team of young students descends onto the ruined Earth, where they find the frozen bodies of Jason and Rowan in the forgotten research facility and take back on board their ship with them. Rowan is thawed and revived, but the team mistakes Jason to be dead, having no idea of his abilities or motives. Before long, Jason awakens to the sound of young people having premarital sex once again, and the carnage erupts once again as the ship proceeds to Earth II. The remaining survivors fight for their lives as the centuries-old mad slasher proves that he is just as evil and just as indestructible during their time as he was centuries before. \r\n\r\nNow where to start...DO NOT TAKE THIS FILM SERIOUSLY AT ALL. The plot is just out there in the realms of fantasy. There is no way that in the year 2455 we will be able to bring people back to life with robotic ants. Second of all, the characters are two dimensional apart from a certain few (and those are the ones who survived). There aint any worthy talent in this film and i ain`t surprised. I only liked 3 of the cast. The Hot girl that died by being sucked out into space, The guy that looks like a young Matthew Perry and The Tough Black Soldier Guy. And Jason X was pretty damn cool, but not amazingly wow Cool.\r\n\r\nI also must mention that The Special Effects are just terrible. They are Early PS2 Graphics and they look incredibly shit. I mean granted its 2001 and CGI wasn`t at the level it is today, but still they could have done a lot better.\r\n\r\nOverall its terrible but can be fun at the same time. While watching it, I had this fun feeling to it. I guess you could watch and enjoy it without taking it seriously in a way. I mean i could when I was 12 or 13 but now i`m 16 and I can just about get through it.\r\n\r\n[b]Rating - 49% - C+[/b]",

While the whole 'Jason in space' thing might seem stupid and silly (as if the series was ever really clever) my main problem with \"Jason X\" is that is just flat out boring. The characters, the kills, the thrills are all pretty dull, they don't even take a chance to make Jason more interesting during his 'upgrade'.

In order to even remotely pull a film like this off you need to have a decent sized budget. Jason X doesn't, in fact it looks like it was made for a fiver.\n\nThe plot is silly and again seems to disregard every film that came before. The year is 2010 and Jason has been captured and is being held at Camp Crystal Lake research facility! Supposedly he has the power to regenerate tissue so is impossible to kill. He is about to be frozen o be manages to escape and kill some soldiers before eventually being put into the chamber and frozen, taking his doctor with him. Flash forward 400 years, Jason is found by a bunch of space junk hunters and brought aboard their spaceship. Needless to say he thaws out and begins another killing spree.\n\nThis idea could have worked if they had a decent budget, setting the story in the future gives the film makers plenty of interesting ways for Jason to kill his victims. Sadly we get one decent kill and then the usual slice and dice. The zero budget means that the sets are terrible, the acting non-existent, the special effects cartoonish, the worst score I have ever heard and simply awful dialogue. Everything about the film is cheap and it's downright boring. It's no longer a horror, it's an action sci-fi with obvious references to aliens. You have to laugh that a film this bad tries to emulate such a classic film. Don't get me started on \"robot\" Jason, it looks terrible and the series died as soon as he came on screen.\n\nSilly silly film, awful production values and downright boring.",

Beyond that, this film has lackluster acting, it is way too sexist for it to have any kind of decency and... It's just stupid. The first ten minutes of the film, before they jump in time, are its best minutes. The scenery is cool-looking, you actually get to see Jason Voorhees again and you'll get this oh-shit-feeling when he is cryogenicly suspended. And after he and the woman wake up... It's all downhill from there, and that's saying something when even the best minutes were worth perhaps two and a half stars. So yeah, this film blows monkeys.

It's bad, but unless you're taking this film seriously, it can be guilty fun. The idea is so absurd that you can't help but watch it, and to be fair, the kills in this movie are kind of cool, with the passing of time making MPAA more favorable to censoring, hence Jason X has a good deal of violence.

A futuristic game of cat and mouse, where there will be only one outcome - the main cast member survives, Jason kills off everybody else, and then seemingly appears dead himself........ until the next instalment is released about a year later that is! It does pack the film full of extra's who get bumped off in a variety of inhumane and comical ways, which makes the film quite enjoyable, but these films are becoming all so predictable. Having said that, i will end up watching the inevitable 11th edition (and 12th, 13th, 14th etc etc) when it comes out!",

            "content": "So we're up to Jason in Space, huh?\n\nBefore I get the hell going on this particular \"Friday\" review, a little fascinating (okay, maybe not) info about yours truly:  I've reviewed the \"Friday the 13th\" flicks TWICE before for various online places/publications, and on both of those occasions I said \"screw it\" after \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" rolled around.  The reasons were many.  I thought the series would have ended just fine after \"Jason Takes Manhattan.\"  I hated the fact that Sean Cunningham came along after many years of disassociating himself with the series that I grew up loving and, in essence, trashing it.  And I HATED the self-referential/jokey tone that the New Line entries had.  In essence, I really, really detested this period in \"Friday the 13th\" lore.\n\nEventually, I DID write a review of \"Jason Goes to Hell\" on an online forum, but unless you're one of the loyal posters at the official wrestlecrap forums, you'd never seen me review \"JGTH\" before...but this one escaped me.  Until now.  Yes, folks, this is the first time that your humble host has ever written a review of \"Jason X,\" so now that I've officially raised the expectations pretty high for this momentous occasion, prepare to be disappointed.\n\nDespite this flick's status as the FIRST \"Friday the 13th\" film we got in nearly a ten-year period, for some reason, it's always been just kind of there for me.  This has got to be some kind of major accomplishment - the movie is about friggin' JASON VOORHEES TROMPING AROUND IN A SPACE STATION, for Christ's sakes.  It's not supposed to be dull and monotonous, but nonetheless, that's what we get with this movie.  The characters, with one notable exception, are entirely forgettable, and the writing is fairly moronic.  Okay, maybe not fairly - it's fully, 100% moronic.  Still, for all intents and purposes, I didn't hate \"Jason X,\" and with my third viewing of the movie coming just yesterday in anticipation of this review (I hope you're happy, loyal cavalcade of three fans), it's got a few things going for it that I'll get to in a bit.\n\nThe lone Horror Nerd interesting fact about the production of this movie - believe it or not, Sean Cunningham decided to produce this film because \"Freddy vs. Jason\" had been in development hell for so long that he thought another \"Friday\" film would be fun to do.  Color me impressed, Mr. \"Get this guy the hell out of the hockey mask.\"\n\nOkay, the story.  I don't know, do you really need a story?  Isn't \"Jason in Space\" really all the story you need?  You want more?  Okay.  It's the year 2008, and Jason Voorhees (once again played by Kane Hodder, and once again we get to witness the hulking stuntman/character actor absolutely nail the silent role) has been captured by the U.S. government.  It seems that scientists want to study his strange regenerative powers.  Of course, horrific accidents occur wherein our hockey-masked hero (it feels really good to type those two words after the review of \"JGTH,\" it really does) causes all sorts of havoc, and eventually wounds up cryogenically frozen with one of researchers.\n\nFlash forward to 2455.  Humanity has taken to the stars, or something.  Actually, it is explained - the real Earth has become polluted to the point that human beings can't survive there anymore.  Happy, plot completists?  Anyway, a group of students find the research facility, unthaw Jason, and bring him aboard their ship.  Of this group of characters, the only one even worth mentioning is Kay-Em 14, a shapely robot chick the researchers have with them as an assistant.  She's the only one you'll remember by name at the conclusion of the film; the rest of the cast is murder fodder.\n\nAt that level, though, this film is infinitely better than \"Jason Goes to Hell.\"  Two main improvements that the creators of the series made from the previous installment:\n\n(1) Much more screen time for Kane Hodder.  Forgive me for beating the dead horse, but the man IS Jason, and his presence and malice - sorely missed for 13 years - is back in full-form this go 'round.\n\n(2) Awesome kills.  Two in particular really stand out in this flick - the \"frozen face smash\" and the \"back breaker\" deaths.  The former is easily the most memorable kill since the immortal \"sleeping bag of death\" kill from \"Friday the 13th Part VII.\"  So huzzah to writer Todd Farmer for that.\n\nOh, and then there's the \"Virtual Camp Crystal Lake\" sequence, damn near worth the price of admission alone.  While some critics point to the scene as too tongue-in-cheek, I chuckle every time I see it.  The material that we're parodying here isn't Shakespeare, after all; it's a silly slasher series.  A lot of fans (myself included) got a kick out of the familiarity of the scene, and it was quite the interesting little sidebar.\n\nUnfortunately, there really isn't a whole lot else to say about \"Jason X.\"  It's Jason in Space.  It's campy, somewhat fun, a little ridiculous, but overall a pretty forgettable little film with plenty of completely disposable characters whose names you can't even remember 24 hours after watching it.  It's definitely not the worst movie in the series, but nowhere near almost ALL of the Paramount films, and it's easy to see how this flew in and out of theaters as quickly as it did.  In short, it's just as mediocre as this review.",

I was hoping to do a blu-ray review, but i haven't been able to find this yet in hi-def or blu-ray. Anyways, Jason is frozen in cryo-freeze and thawed out in the year 2455 only to wreak the normal kind of terror on a group of science students aboard a research vessel called the Grendel. The movie moves pretty fast paced, but it lacks any real depth or story. Basically a new effort to boldly take Jason to the next frontier, which in this case is outer space. I guess i can't act so surprised, i mean he has taken New York, been to hell, fought Freddy, had a remake, what else is left? I got it: Jason Goes to Candyland!

That was one of the funniest things I've seen in a while, but it looke like it would've made more sense in an Erin Freedberg and Jeff Seltzer movie.

In Jason X's case, the body count and inventive deaths are worth the hour and a half of cheesy characters, sub-par acting, and super terrible plot. \r\n\r\nThis is a movie where you enjoy rooting for the bad guy because you WANT to see some of these annoying characters die. This movie is not to be taken seriously on any level.  He puts a chick's face into dry ice then slams it into a table, shattering it into a pile of ice and mush. He throws a guy onto a giant spiky screw, then watches as the guy's body twists down the screw, twirling up his insides. He pulls the side of a spaceship off (as Uber Jason) and causes a girl to get sucked through a grate. That sounds like entertainment to me!",

And to Mumu_Lovelace, who gave this a 100% \"Fresh\" rating, you are a RUSTED TOOL, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. This isn't a movie for anyone but weed-addicted jerks with Hockey masks who think the upgraded Jason is God. I'm still shaking to this day thinking about that horrible and scary upgraded version of Jason....and then there was Jason Goes To Hell...don't even get me started on that horrible mess of a film. Thank my brain cells that I got rid of the DVD. It is, in all truth, one of the most intoxicating experiences of my entire life. Do not go watch this at all costs.\r\n\r\nBottom Line: Go out, find every copy of this movie that you can, bury them in a inaccesible place, and blow them ALL up. And then proceed to rent a GOOD movie, like Quentin Taratino's Inglorious Basterds...or Gone With The Wind...or Crank 2: High Voltage...or actually even a Disney Direct-To-Video Sequel!",

The series took the one thing that they had never done before and sent Jason way into the future and took him up to space, in the process he got a new look and mistakenly identified as a shooting star. I did think the end served as promise for the series and that they may try again back in the original setting, but part of me hoped they would just leave it alone, which they did. Worth the watch to close the original series off.",

            "content": "At one time in Jason X, a female says a certain line that I should bring up. \r\n\r\n\"This sucks on so many levels\" \r\n\r\nI am not sure if she was saying it because she was dragged by gravitional space or she realized that after a hour has passed, what you have seen is merely a profound disaster set in space with a modified Jason who more or less is in the same film since the late 70's. Disaster is what this film is from the beginging all the way to the end. \r\n\r\nThe film starts of with a sort of \"Alien\" sequence in a secluded area in which Jason is tied and placed in cryopreservation. Frozen but like all sci fi thrillers, something always happen. Always a disaster or a mistake which concludes to some hyper sleep which ends up 400 years later. Seem more confusing then ever but what ends up more confusing is that despite the immense technology, Jason is never really killed and common sense has never participated in this film. Jason was to cunning that he knew where people were and knew when to attack, almost hitting the right notes to further distress our victims. With no pro thinking whatsoever from any point of view. He just kills a dozen of horny students, a money hungry teacher, and prideful grunts. Where msot of them scream and some fight back. Interesting but badly executed. \r\n\r\nThere is no lake and no camp. Just a spaceship. Wether this is a direct sequel or a spinoff is not of question but wether if Jason can ever die or will someone just blow him up to pieces. That thought was never put to mind as people were to worried with details and compromising deaths. Like fire sqaud, electric chair, and poisoning. Actually, the whole cast was written to simply blast him apart with high power futuristic guns. But never once tried to blow him up. Common sense is not respected. Nothing is respected. Just cold blooded killing and a fierce Jason whos bent on killing just anyone because mommy died. \r\n\r\nThere is no retrospect of his life other then what I have already told you. This film holds no bold statement and relies to much on man slaughter. Sex and greed plays a huge part but the story is to dull and the characters to forgettable. Its not creative and it doesnt capture fire. All it does is relinquish old cliches by making them even more annoying. Or to modify it to a degree of great travesty. Even the steel armor and the slick machete is never respected because everything was so bad. We were simply at lost at this imagination of a horror. It greets and beats like every other Jason film. It doesnt hold and doesnt excite the faithful fans. It just makes them more impatient. \r\n\r\nJason X is the perfect example of how to turn a great horror phenom into something foolish and pathetic. Not even the nice crystal lake sequence in the end can do enough to get the monkey of the back, ironically.",

            "content": "So, I just saw Jason X a few minutes ago. After analyzing, I'm ready to give my own thoughts. Some of you may disagree, some of you may agree. If you haven't seen the movie, my review contains mild spoilers.\r\n\r\nI thought Jason X was okay, as in it wasn't a masterpiece. I drifted into the suspense of the movie, but it didn't leave a long lasting impression on me. To add on that, there was only a few characters which were developed into, the plot was pretty bad, some of the dialogue was cheesy, and the concept is just atrocious. Jason Voohrees being in the future has to be one of the stupidest ideas I have ever heard. It just proves that they didn't have a good idea of what to do after nine sequels.\r\n\r\nSome of the positive additions were the badass deaths, which included having your frozen face smashed on-top of a counter, and slowly descending down a suspended drill bit. The music was good, but it isn't anything noteworthy or amazing.\r\n\r\nGoing into more in-depth with the characters: Lowe was the greedy guy, Kay-Em was an android created by Tsunaron (and conveniently they're lovers), and Brodski was the fearless fighter; Everyone else was average, or boring. The story takes place in the distant future when Earth has become too polluted to live on, so human kind lives on a new planet called Earth 2. After a field trip, a crew discovers Jason and they bring him on board their space ship, only to be running from him until the end of the movie. As for the dialogue, there's not much to say about it other then \"overused, and juiceless\".\r\n\r\nEven though Jason X is a slasher film, there's one particular moment that anyone will laugh at: the sleeping bag murder. During the final minutes of the movie, they trick Jason with a hologram of Crystal Lake, with two ladies asking Jason to either smoke drugs, drink some beer, or if he wants to have premarital sex with them. They even take their tops off, which is amusing to tell the truth, but this whole scene is unrealistic. But anyways, how does he kill them? Well he grabs one of girls in her sleeping bag and smashes the other, then once the first one's dead he flings the survivor into the tree. It may sound devastating in the review, but you have to see it for yourself. It's fucking hilarious.\r\n\r\nOverall, should you watch this movie? Unless if you're a fan of the Friday the 13th franchise, then probably not. If you've never watched the previous movies, yet you know about Jason, then you won't be lost at the start of the movie. You did miss a lot of backstory, though.\r\n\r\nBy the way, even if you did watch the previous installments, the beginning has Jason captive by the goverment. In the ninth Jason movie, it has him being sent to hell; is Freddy vs. Jason the only way as to how he was captured, because in that he escapes hell. What the hell...",

But lo and behold, that sucked balls too, creating a terrible festering mass of failure and laughable attempts at storytelling. To be honest, I really couldn't tell if this was a comedic parody or a horror film. I'm still not 100% sure. \r\nThe background to the plot, however, is rather interesting; an apocalyptically desecrated Earth with humanity spread among the stars, with a research group returning to the inhospitable planet to study the ancient civilization that used to flourish there. This does not even begin to scratch the surface of redemption for this terrible movie however, as Jason continues with his murderous escapades for no explainable reason. \r\n\r\nCompletely terrible, don't waste money buying or renting it. It's not even worth the fraction of a calorie it takes to twist your eyes in their sockets to stare at the cover. \r\n\r\n1/10",

I'd be lying if I wasn't entertained by it to some degree though. This film boasts the biggest body count of any Friday the 13th film with a staggering 28 kills. And even though Jason suddenly has hair, for whatever miraculous reason, I actually don't mind how he looks up until he becomes some weird hybrid of Lord Zedd and Super Shredder...I mean Uber-Jason. Some of the kills are really awesome though. They revisit the sleeping bag kill from part seven in this one and it's pretty entertaining. The real kill that steals the show is Adrienne's kill. When Jason first wakes up from cryogenic stasis, he takes Adrienne's face, shoves it into a sink filled with liquid nitrogen, pulls it out, and then smashes it on a nearby table. It's truly the highlight of the film. Jason is in space. That's pretty much the gist of the storyline. Uber-Jason is a joke. Other than looking different, he doesn't do much of anything the normal Jason wouldn't do. With a weak storyline, bad acting, and a rather lame script, Jason X is really only worth watching if you're a die hard Friday the 13th fan. Even then, you're better off watching one of the earlier sequels that you'll know you enjoy.",

It's mindless killing that seems to go nowhere, and will even bore the most hardcore horror movie fan to death . Of course the acting as awful, tasteless, and lets not even start with the dialogue which is downright horrible . If there is at least one thing that saves the movie from being amongst the league of the most horrible of movies released of it's year is the convincing matter of making you feel like Jason is in a futuristic world, giving the movie sort of an alien-ish vibe . \r\n\r\n\r\nOverall - Jason X is what you would expect from a modern B horror flick . It's awful, and redundant right down to the last minutes . It's great amongst it's class of B list horror movies, but that's not a compliment, it's an insult . It's not even a popcorn flick it's film you shouldn't watch . Even if your a fan of Friday the 13th avoid this movie at all cost .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Jose A. Ramirez Moya",

I once told somebody about this movie, and they didn't believe me because the concept is so ridiculous. After watching it with an open mind, this movie is actually pretty good. they use the science fiction aspect pretty well and it's not just there for kicks. the characters are still kind of bland but at least they have personality. the kill scenes are pretty cool and much better than in Jason takes Manhattan (especially the sleeping bag scene). some of the comedy is useless and not funny, but at least they're trying. a lot of scenes remind me of James Cameron's Aliens. the suspense is great, just when you think Jason is dead, he comes back for more. the ending was great and it gives you that good old Friday the 13th feeling, even though there was no direct sequel to follow (it would be kinda hard to keep the series fresh after this).

Putting a new spin on the familiar formula, from the opening moments (with a neat David Cronenberg cameo) you know this is going to good. It's clever, it's witty, it's self knowing, and it's better than pretty much all of the other nine films combined. The killings are more creative and inventive, the script is laced with a streak of self-deprecation and sly irony and the film looks better, with some cool set work, costume design and effects.

Jason X is a bad, bad movie. It is better than New Blood or Jason Takes Manhattan in acting and spirit wise, but it surpasses stupidity than both of those films. The flick is clumsy beyond redeeming bounds or value. It is incompetent, inept, insipid, gloriously moronic, and a lot more. Did I mention it is incredibly stupid by a new record? The film suffers from the obvious bad writing, characters, plot, development, cinematography, suspense, and logic, but suffers with bad special effects and that takes a toll. The special effects have always meant something in Friday the 13th flicks as we gather up to see a new way of slashing, stabbing, dicing, and other deaths. However, here the CGI is fairly obvious that a preschooler can tell the obvious cheapness and have, for whomever, memories back to the 50\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s when two paper plates with strings were used for flying saucers. \r\n\r\n2010 \r\nThe film opens up in 2010 as Jason is held captive by a small military unit with commanding officers and team of scientist bent on using him despite scientist Rowan\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s objection. They visit to transport him, but are killed off when Jason breaks free. Rowan, the final girl, reacts quickly by defeating Jason in placing him in a capsule to be cryogenically frozen. Victory, apparently not, is cut or stabbed when Jason pierces Rowan from leaving out the door. The two are frozen. \r\n\r\n2455 \r\nThe frozen bodies are discovered after a group of students with an accompanying professor. They find Jason first, and we learned that hockey has been outlawed for some odd reason, goodbye dentist. Anyways, the students find Rowan and take both of them to a spaceship, but not before its accidents. Anyways, we go to the spaceship and learn it is filled with sex crazed students running around having fun. I can\u00c3\u00a2(TM)t remember if any of them were doing drugs, but that\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s not the point. Among unfreezing the two, the chaos begins. I was amazed that stupidity flourishes throughout the future. We begin with Professor Lowe as he is told by a financial adviser that human from the past is worth a lot of money. However, the killer Jason Voorhees is worth a lot more. I am guessing the financial backer has seen some of the Friday the 13th films. Wanting to profit, Lowe has Jason unfrozen despite Rowan\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s objection and once again, chaos ensues. I cannot remember who, but Jason wakes up as female scientist Adrienne has her back turned and echoes of sadomasochism. This scene is amusing as it is tasteless.  Anyways, Jason wakes up delivers the first and best kill since 445 years as he holds Adrienne's face in liquid nitrogen and smashing her face in bits. \r\n\r\nNow that Jason has been brought back to life and ready to slash, I am going to make ephemeral talking about what goes on next. The crew is unaware of Jason, so it allows us to relax and enjoy the insightful view of stupidity and death. Students and staff are picked off one by one as they commit all the errors that lead to death in a slasher film. There is an attempt of resistance as a number of folks with brief personalities battle Jason only to die. I guess they did not receive the memo of Jason\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s ability to regenerate loss skin tissue or damage. Anyways, folks are picked off one by one as they wander around in the dark yelling out names. It is no surprise. Anyways, we get the whole \u00c3\u00a2Ten Little Indians\u00c3\u00a2? concept as it boils down to the final girl, but I was surprised as the flick took a few positive turns. A handful of people make it out alive only to learn the spaceship is damaged and ready to blow up. There is an improvement around here when battle takes place between Jason Voorhees and a sexy android known as the KM-14. The battle scene is loaded with laughs and excitement that doesn\u00c3\u00a2(TM)t save the flick. The film looks like it\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s clear for ending, but another twist appears. This twist is ludicrous outstretching the flick until the ending secured, uneven. Jason has landed on Earth 2, kill-k-kill. \r\n\r\n2011/present \r\nI return to the first paragraphs the film\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s flaws as it is pervasive. I could go on with a large list enough to be a single roll of toilet paper, but that will be boring. The necessity to get intricate in criticism is not required because the intelligence and structure is frivolous. Its absurdity and sullen style can be spotted within the opening. However, a Jason flicks have always perverse itself with a dark sense of humor overtime, so I forgive it on that part. At this moment, I flurry into the film\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s positive. Its triumph relies in vulgarity and stupidity. They mesh together and polish the film near it\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s so bad it\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s good. There\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s a great cheap scene with the ship colliding with a station known as Solaris. Awfulness is pretty funny throughout including two gaudy scenes that\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s a new record in my book. I cannot describe it completely as I am tempted to tell you watch the film or spoil all. However, I can allow hints and winks when we see KM-14\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s envy during one scene and two sexy girls\u00c3\u00a2(TM) valiant resistance and mutual endeavor with Jason. Indeed, this fun and humorous if you are tolerant to this behavior. I could only have hoped for a brief romanticism in the flick. Aesthetic meets schlock in bowl of blood with limps floating. An attempt to bring a sort of innocence to the young adults in the spaceship as crew and staff bite their nails. Added correctly with writing, direction, and mood, the film would have made an adult feel like a kid. I admit I found myself in this position. It is sad, however, that I must return from fantasy to finish this flick. \r\n\r\nWe are left with a too long journey as the flick tries to be serious at times with eclectic elements from better flicks. The list is not long, but I thought the following: Alien (A), Blade Runner, Hellraiser: Bloodline (D-), and 2001: A Space Odyssey (A) just to name a few. I can\u00c3\u00a2(TM)t recall if I saw any Star Wars or Star Trek influences. Anyways, we get themes from the flick, and it is unable to transform itself. Better yet, there is no clear visual to what the film wants to be. Are we supposed to get a scary film gone wrong or is this was an attempt to make a campy and silly flick with optional variation. The weigh questions burdens down the ship. There\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s trouble with the engine! The cinematography ruins the picture as hinted the use of a cheap digital recording camera. The engine is burning! I was offended by the sight of bad CGI as I began to ponder the comparison between this and legendary Ed Wood films. Okay forget the fire, the engine is gone! I could forgive a bad film if it is pretty funny Texas Chainsaw Massacre- the Next Generation, but Jason X misses, ah!, the mark, squeal, for a recommendable, gah!, opinion, agh!. Yet, I cannot dismiss it, phew.  I enjoyed the documentary The Many Lives of Jason Voorhees and some other cool special features, but it is not enough for mainstream audience to watch. Jason fans will and the opinion will be mixed. \r\n\r\nOther notes: you know a movie is in trouble when fame critic like Roger Ebert uses the word \u00c3\u00a2suck\u00c3\u00a2? in a review. I understand why original director of Friday the 13th Sean Cunningham produced this flick, but he should have stayed patient or keenly aware of the film. The senescent Jason has shown no sign of retiring.\r\n\r\nGrade: (D+) film (C-) DVD\r\n\r\nFlick written by Todd Farmer and directed Jason Isaac.",

I am not a fan of horror films and don't usually watch them but once I read what this one was about I became curious...and curiosity killed the cat as they say...Lord have mercy on my soul! I can honestly say in my personal opinion that THIS is the scariest, most terrifying, horrifying movie I have seen in my life. Granted I have not see many horror movies but from the ones I have seen, this one takes top prize! Jason Voorhees returns with a new look, a new machete, and his same murderous attitude as he is awakened on a spaceship in the 25th century! I saw this film years ago in Hawaii at the theater and needless to say I went with a good friend.  We had to take turns sleeping at each other's apartments because we were big time scared!! I had a big headache once we got home...The writing team of Victor Miller and Todd Farmer was amazing. The director-James Isaac truly knows his craft in evoking fear and suspense! Even down to the soundtrack, sound effects, this man did an unbelievable job! Perhaps this is one of the few times where our villain (main protagonist) does not utter one word in the whole movie yet his  mere presence is enough to send chills down our spine (with that unforgettable sound)...In 2008, Jason Voorhees is captured by the U.S. government. Rowan (Lexa Doig), a government researcher, leads several unsuccessful attempts to execute him. In 2010, she decides to place him in cryogenic suspension to neutralize him. Unfortunately, the government has other plans, hoping to profit from research into Jason's rapid cellular regeneration. Jason escapes while being moved and kills seven soldiers. Rowan manages to lure him into the cryonic chamber and activates it. However, Jason manages to stab her through the door, both wounding her and freezing them both inside the sealed room.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2455, Earth has become too polluted to support life and humanity has moved to a new planet, Earth Two. Five students on a field trip led by Professor Lowe (Jonathan Potts) enter the facility and find Jason and Rowan. They take them back to their spacecraft and reanimate Rowan. Jason is deemed deceased and left in the morgue. During a call to his financial backer, Professor Lowe explains that he had hoped to exploit Rowan's status as the oldest person revived from cryostasus for profit, as he is in serious debt. The man dismisses this, but notes that Voorhees' body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector. In the morgue, the ice on Jason begins to thaw and he becomes reanimated..all hell breaks loose and as you can guess, Jason goes on a killing spree but this time, he is a cyborg with regenerative tissue. For pete's sakes Jason cannot seem to be put down for good! As you are aware a few days ago Friday 13th was released nationwide (still playing I think)- common Jason Voorhees must be 50 something years old by now- do us a favor Hollywood, KILL this character once and for all...he deserves it. For the rest, watch at ur own risk because the movie is intense, and terrifying. It should satisfy the hard core horror fans.",

Not only is it much more fresh and fun than the preceding 3 entries, but it's also more tongue-in-cheek (and not in an annoying way either). I'd say that this goes back to what they started with Friday the 13th Part 6, and that's a good thing! \n\nIt's been awhile since I've seen this one, so my memory's a little fuzzy, but still I'd like to mention a few things that stick out. Firstly, though this film doesn't exactly set the bar for great horror filmmaking, this has one of the greatest onscreen deaths in film history. I won't say what it is, but you'll realize what it is when your mind is blown. \n\nThe major mistake the film makes is in \"updating\" Jason. His general look has always been unmistakably and irrationally creepy, but the new \"futuristic\" look just succeeds in making him look kind of lame. The scenes with him fighting the robot lady were entertaining, but definitely cheapened what was an already dying series. \n\nAll in all, a more fun entry than the preceding few, and not as moronic as the previous one (at least this actually has Jason instead of Jason's spirit inhabiting random guys' bodies!) but definitely feels like DTV material. I like it overall, but it sure didn't do much for the series' credibility. Thankfully I think the recent remake took a step in the right direction.",

Could he be put on display like an ancient artifact and paraded in front of the slavering masses for fun and profit?\n\nA government researcher named Rowan (Doig) has decided to cryogenically freeze Jason Voorhees (Hodder) after it has been determined that he cannot be executed due to his ability to regenerate.  The government, however, wants to make money off of Jason and make plans to further research in the direction of understanding the nature of regenerative process.   Naturally chaos ensues when Jason escapes and butchers numerous soldiers.  He is finally contained and frozen but not before he stabs a government researcher named Rowan and  pierces the chamber causing a leak which freezes her as well.  They are discovered in 2455 and Rowan is reanimated.  Jason is considered too far gone and left alone.  This proves to be a major miscalculation because Jason comes to life and begins the fine processes of thinning out the herd.\n\nThe first half of this film is actually entertaining.  With Jason roaming about picking off more soldiers one by one it has a particular rhythm that sustains it for a considerable length of time.  But then Jason disappears and it turns into a rather pedestrian story about a scared crew trying to get off of their space ship.  Once Jason disappears the story recedes and there just isn\u0092t anything worth getting worked up over.\n\nThe film features a whole lot of techno speak which obviously means something to somebody but if you don\u0092t speak the language you end up nodding your head a lot wishing Jason would burst through a door and slaughter whatever annoying tit is polluting the screen with his or her inane warblings.\n\nAgain, early on it feels that the sci-fi/spree killer matrix is going to work out just fine.  It\u0092s a fantastic concept: putting Jason on board with a group of faceless, nameless gits who make good fodder for a creature as gifted as our hero.  And as long as the killings continue, it appears that the film is successful.  Unfortunately they take the star out of the film and spend the next half whining and puling about how they are going to escape the heavily damaged vessel and make it out alive.  It\u0092s like \u0093Aliens\u0094 without the pulsating glamour of the beasts and it just doesn\u0092t mean much in the end.\n\nThe film looks like every other sci-fi catastrophe film ever made only a bit cheaper.  It\u0092s got the fancy computer networks, nifty devices, plus the ability to regenerate flesh, reattach limbs, etc.  People have all moved to Earth 2 because the first Earth is too polluted.  It\u0092s a chic snap at human kind\u0092s continuing use of their home planet as a garbage dump.\n\nAdmittedly, all of the females in this filmed are highly sexed up.  They wear skimpy little outfits that clearly make the film more watchable.  Without them, one would just fade into oblivion because none of the men are worth looking at.  They are all expendable and as always it\u0092s a grave pleasure to watch most of them get snuffed out.\n\nKay-Em 14 is one hot love-bot.  She has been created for reasons that are readily apparent to anyone who has seen her making out with her creator.  With Jason on the loose he gives her an upgrade and she suddenly showcases two enormous guns which manage to blow Jason to smithereens.   Sexy women (even robot women) with guns are always welcome and this film manages to deliver quite effectively on that front.   It\u0092s about the only truly fascinating part of the second half of the film.  Otherwise its just watching the crew members waiting and hoping that Jason cannot break through and slaughter them all.  He has his chances but is repeatedly rebuffed so a handful of them eventually do escape and Jason is cast out into oblivion.  \n\nOverall, this film manages to entertain for roughly ninety minutes before being transformed into a by-the-numbers sci-fi thriller.   Jason remains the only truly viable character and his mad killing spree is the highlight of the film.  He\u0092s a force of pure animal magnetism because he always seems to attract those who are just crying out to be butchered where they stand.  There are some regrettable kills in this film.  I was quite enjoying watching Adrienne (Angus) pretending to do some scientific work.  Like always, Jason always kills the most sexually alluring female first.  He simply cannot stand female sexuality and must destroy it whenever he encounters it.",

Maybe because my expectations were so low going in, I couldn't help but have a blast watching this flick.  It was campy and highly entertaining.  Unlike 'Jason Takes Manhattan', the change of scenery works because the filmmakers embrace the fact that this is 'Part 10' of a horror franchise.  There aren't going to be any good scares here, just some great kills and cheesy humor.  Jason in the VR room was simply classic.

In order to even remotely pull a film like this off you need to have a decent sized budget. Jason X doesn't, in fact it looks like it was made for a fiver.\n\nThe plot is silly and again seems to disregard every film that came before. The year is 2010 and Jason has been captured and is being held at Camp Crystal Lake research facility! Supposedly he has the power to regenerate tissue so is impossible to kill. He is about to be frozen o be manages to escape and kill some soldiers before eventually being put into the chamber and frozen, taking his doctor with him. Flash forward 400 years, Jason is found by a bunch of space junk hunters and brought aboard their spaceship. Needless to say he thaws out and begins another killing spree.\n\nThis idea could have worked if they had a decent budget, setting the story in the future gives the film makers plenty of interesting ways for Jason to kill his victims. Sadly we get one decent kill and then the usual slice and dice. The zero budget means that the sets are terrible, the acting non-existent, the special effects cartoonish, the worst score I have ever heard and simply awful dialogue. Everything about the film is cheap and it's downright boring. It's no longer a horror, it's an action sci-fi with obvious references to aliens. You have to laugh that a film this bad tries to emulate such a classic film. Don't get me started on \"robot\" Jason, it looks terrible and the series died as soon as he came on screen.\n\nSilly silly film, awful production values and downright boring.\n3/10",
