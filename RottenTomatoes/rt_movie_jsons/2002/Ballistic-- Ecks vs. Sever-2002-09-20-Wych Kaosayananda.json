Don't you have family??? Besides, you'll kill yoursel_ oh nevermind).\nSo, you can easily guess how bad this was gonna be, and the person who doesn't read reviews before watching can tell how bad it is by the TITLE. Like WHAT does BALLISTIC: ECKS VS. SEVER mean? It sounds more like a bad shark movie!\nAnyways, Banderas and Liu look cool, but everything is ruined in the action. Why is everyone running during the entire film, and why is a car exploding every few minutes??!!\nThe movie is brainless action, but still manages to be boring. That's my review. Bye bye.

The film is certainly pointless, loaded with ridiculous plot twists and absurd action sequences, but how many action films don't fit this description? Seriously, if you want to see what two entertaining actors and a lot of wasted film can do together, this film is worth a look. it's plot heavy, bit soul-less and clichéd, but entertaining nonetheless.\n\nI turned it on at 3AM one sleepless night because I wanted to see what the heck Liu and Banderas were doing in a direct to video film. Expecting a thoroughly dreadful film, I was pleasantly surprised, and found the film to be entertaining. The film views like a series of strung together early-80s MTV videos with a contemporary hard rock sound track, plenty of loud noises and explosions, and, thankfully, few words.\n\nTo the extent that I remember it, the plot was about Banderas trying to rescue his wife and son from the clutches of some very evil super-secret spy types (who are nevertheless apparently exceedingly inept). A lot of stuff got blown up - in fact most of the sets were heavily rigged with explosives which seemed to go off at random intervals. Of course there were a lot of gunshots, fists, and kicks. I don't recall any swords or phasers though. If I say anything about Lucy Liu at all, I will give away the rest of the plot (which ought to tell you something about the quality of the script and the complexity of the plot) Lighten up! It's bad, but it's just a B movie. And this is what B movies are supposed to be about. By the way, a better choice for an utterly stupid action/violence flick is the masterpiece of violence surrealism \"Mean Guns\"",

It's actually a quite enjoyable and action packed film taking a brilliant advantage of filming in a brilliant location. Former FBI agent Jeremiah Ecks (Antonio Banderas) is assigned by the Defense Intelligence Agency to help find the kidnapped son of the agency's director Robert Gant (Greg Henry), the son Michael (Aidan Drummond) was kidnapped after a trip away to Berlin. They find that the former DIA agent named Sever (Lucy Liu), and after a huge shootout in downtown Vancouver, Sever escapes, but Ecks learns that Gant stole a nanobot and has smuggled it back from Berlin by putting it in Michael's body. Gant's wife Vinn (Talisa Soto) was married to Ecks a few years previously, and Gant separated them by making one another think they were killed in car bombs, but Ecks soon finds himself in league with Sever to try and put a stop to Gant's plan. Yes, it is a very silly film with a ridiculous plot, but it has some brilliant action sequences throughout, and one or two good chase scenes, all filmed in Vancouver in locations including the Public Library, Stanley Park and the Aquarium, which seldom get seen on film. It's not perfect, but it's certainly not as bad as what the critics made it out to be at the time. There are FAR WORSE films than this one.",

And I DO mean a s*** ton.\n\nThe action scenes actually manage to get boring. And every time you think you're bored to tears from it, they blow up something else. (As you can imagine, that happens a lot.)\n\nI don't quite remember what I was expecting to see. I guess I was expecting to see some real ass kicking between Ecks and Sever going at it, but no no no...That all ends not even 3 quarters of the movie when, spoiler alert, they join forces. Yes. No longer VS anymore. \n\nDoes that even matter at this point? Not to mention that the characters in the movie do absolutely nothing to make you give a damn about them or what's happening in the film. No commitment from either stars, Banderas or Liu. Forget the rest of the cast, or the fact that Talisa Soto is only known for playing Kitana in the Mortal Kombat movies and nothing else. Okay, that was a tangent. Sorry.\n\nThis movie sucks.
