Thru incredibly patient detail, Ghibli's artists bring to life everything from accurately portraying the feelings and physical movement of a young girl, to landscapes and environments full of detail that are so typical of the respect given by Japanese Shinto. But more importantly, the story in \"Spirited Away\" addresses the hallmark issues of modern Japan; issues which are incredibly human, and universal.\n\nA coming of age story, this animated movie brings to light almost all the important challenges that we face today: Everything from bravery in the face of disaster, the value of generosity and friendship, respect and patience for others... I continue to draw inspiration and see depth in this film years after having first seen it. \n\nJapanese culture is known to be one of hard work and excellence, and \"Spirited Away\" presents that solitary, dedicated life to a tee. Another great theme in Japanese culture is the important ability to befriend enemies and adapt to change. But perhaps it's greatest insight: that whatever you have lived, no matter if forgotten, stays with you and empowers you, is perhaps this movie's most important lesson. One that is transmitted with the greatest care and consideration; something that is deeply lacking in our society today.\n\n\"Spirited Away\" is a shining example of excellence in story telling, and will stand as a benchmark for filmmakers for ages to come.",

            "content": "This will be my last review for 2022. Where do I even begin? If I ever did a Top 10 list with the greatest films I have ever seen, Spirited Away would easily be in the top 5. It is, undoubtedly, one of the greatest Japanese films I've seen, one of the greatest animated films, and certainly of the greatest films I have ever seen in my life. Probably one of the best of all time, as well. In contrast to Pixar and Disney, who already suffer from sequel/spinoff fatigue, repetitive themes and familiar plots (that elicit the same feelings all the time), Studio Ghibli manages to create true experiences. I don't mean to blame Pixar or Disney (they are both excellent in their own right), but movies from Studio Ghibli always make me feel something, whether that is happiness, sadness, awe, fear, melancholy, anger. Their animation is beautiful, absolutely gorgeous eye candy. Their characters (mostly female heroines) are always fleshed out and well developed. The plotlines are stupidly profound and engaging. The themes they present are relevant and thought provoking. I almost don't want to watch them, because I'm overcome with sadness when I realize that the beautiful adventure I witness will be over soon. Studio Ghibli are special. Their works communicate with the viewer, they make the strongest viewers (of every age, that is) sentimental, they make you feel like a child. They make you proud to still enjoy animation. They are timeless masterpieces. And Japanese cinema overall (along with Italian) is the only one that makes me so emotional. As for the movie itself, I cannot say much, because this is an experience that shouldn't be spoiled. The animation is astonishing, the characters lovely (I absolutely adore Kamaji and I would die for him), the story intriguing, Chihiro herself is a perfect protagonist because of her imperfections. Needless to say that the soundtrack created by auteur Joe Hisaishi is wonderful (I love his works very much and I consider him equal to John Williams). Hayao Miyiazaki himself makes perfect use of the story and Japanese folklore to convey a strong story of courage and determination. He is currently one of my favorite directors. I plan on watching Studio Ghibli's other works in the near future. For now, I recommend that you all stop what you're doing and go watch this masterpiece. This is what true cinema looks like",

I was engaged and on the edge of my seat during the whole film because the script and storyline kept grabbing your attention. It is a very unique and intriguing story that makes you wonder if it was a legend that people passed down from generation to generation. I also really enjoyed the music in the film. Beautiful pieces of sound that brought a different life to the film. Overall, it helped me think in a different way than I had before I watched the film.

Miyazaki films are truly great films in both the traditional film sense and for being amazing adventures of fantasy for anyone willing to take the journey. Spirited Away will suck you in and only let go once the credits have rolled. That being said, the story and characters will stick with you after the movie is over and have a fond place in your memory as all Miyazaki's films do. Highly Recommended!",

Her family is in the process of moving to the suburbs, and they explore the nearby area when they make a wrong turn getting to their new house.  It turns out to be quite the fateful event because Chihiro soon finds herself in a spell-filled world of spirits.  When her parents transform into pigs, it's all up to her to find a remedy and form an escape plan.  Now anime is admittedly a big blind spot for me.  For years I dug my feet in and refused to watch it because there's such an extensive number of options that I didn't know where to start.  It's the same reason I've never really explored Bollywood.  However, I am making small steps to fix that, and I am currently enjoying the ride with my first series, Evangelion.  I decided to watch arguably the most acclaimed anime movie of all time, and Spirited Away is nothing short of wonderful.  Now, even though I am pretty green with anime, this is one of maybe two anime features I've watched in the past.  It was back when I started seriously getting into movies, so I would guesstimate that to be about fifteen years ago.  After all, I was looking at lists like the IMDb top 250 at the time, and this is universally rated highly, so why wouldn't I watch it?  I'm pretty sure I watched the dubbed version at the time, which is not something I did this time around.  Rewatching this was a great experience because I remembered next to nothing about it other than that image of a train ride with the masked character, so it was like I was watching it with fresh eyes.  Right away, this story entices you with mystery.  Sure, these are kind of terrible parents, but their shortcomings are the means to take you to this incredibly well-thought-out world.  They do a fantastic job of pulling you in because they don't take any time at all to lay out the rules.  This is a land where literally anything can happen, and you have to go along for the ride.  Oh, the parents are pigs now?  You don't have time to think about it because now there are ghosts, talking frogs, and a man with six extendable arms.  You can call this the Japanese Alice in Wonderland, and that would be fairly accurate.  I would argue that this is far more substantial because there is so much more character growth that comes with interesting character choices that are made throughout.  The world-building in this is nothing short of incredible, and this is a place that feels lived in at every turn.  This is a movie that fires on all cylinders.  The animation is standout, the score is terrific, and the pacing is taut.  Even if you were like the old me and resisted anime, you should make an exception for this one.",

Western clothes in clear contrast to the traditional uniform she wears once she \"becomes\" Sen.\nThe change coincides with the meeting with Yub\u0101ba who, thanks to a magic spell capable of stealing identities and memories, takes part of her name away (\u5343 Sen is the first character of \u5343\u5c0b Chihiro).\nThe dualism in \"Spirited Away\" (tradition and modernity, East and West) represents a strong conflict that converges in a profound crisis of identity. Haku is unable to remember his real name; No-Face is looking for a place to stay and be accepted; the River Spirit needs to be purified in order to return to its original form.\nThe confused cultural hybridism disorients and frightens the young protagonist who, however, finds the determination and the courage to assert herself and accomplish her coming-of-age. Chihiro/Sen will go back to wearing her old clothes, reaffirming her Westernized identity, but only after having rediscovered her roots, Japanese tradition, and the intrinsic authenticity of her physical and spiritual journey.\nIn \"Spirited Away\" we find all the themes dear to Miyazaki: environmentalism, socialism, the ambiguity of good and evil. But, also, the critique of capitalism and globalization, which deprives the meaning of imported ideas and discredits the local ones.\nBut \"Spirited Away\" is also, and above all, a visually splendid, delicate, rich and sincere film; perfectly edited and marvelously portrayed by its animated characters. It is a masterpiece of craftsmanship that finally consecrates Miyazaki's genius internationally, not only for animation but for cinema in general, spreading his aesthetic throughout the world.",

            "content": "There's a reason Spirited Away won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature \u2014 it's what animated movies are all about. Master animator, Hayao Miyazaki, creates a surreal world of talking frogs, bulbous witches, depressed spirits, and slithery wolf-dragons. The landscapes and food in Studio Ghibli movies always appear sublime. Chihiro (Daveigh Chase), a ten-year-old who is lashing out because she doesn't want to move, is thrust into the dreamscape after only a few minutes in an abandoned amusement park \u2014 her parents (Michael Chiklis & Lauren Holly) gorge themselves on unattended food, quickly morphing into ravenous pigs. Spirited Away nails the subtlety of intertwining overarching issues \u2014 environmentalism, consumerism, modernity vs. tradition \u2014 into the whimsical coming-of-age story. Kamaji (David Ogden Stiers), \"the spider-man,\" is the epitome of a Ghibli character \u2014 he's supernatural with an arch in his relationship with our protag and possesses a big heart. There are countless scenes where Miyazaki flexes his animation muscles, but my favorite comes with Haku (Jason Marsden) when he's in dragon form. It'd been a decade since I last watched this movie and it reminded me of what had made it so special. 20 years later, Spirited Away is still a must-watch and (so far) my favorite Studio Ghibli story.",

Hayao Miyazaki tells the story of a girl who quietly got into the magical world and saved her childhood friend and parents from a sorceress.I want to notice how the world of spirits displays the emotional experiences of the girl and how filigree the director was able to show them.After the parents move, \u0422hihiro enters the world of spirits, the parents mutate into piglets and the girl gets a job with the witch, saves the spirit of the river, breaks the curse. The tale is somewhat similar to the fairy tale Alice in Wonderland. An excellent combination of animation and frame detail, you can catch any freeze frame and the picture will be beautiful. Smooth movements achieved by hours of work were not in vain, along with perfectly matched composition, the picture came out excellent.

This is coming from someone who was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, blown away by Princess Mononoke, emotionally devastated by Grave of the Fireflies and touched by the simplicity of The Cat Returns all but to name a few. Spirited Away is a mystical, charming and truly enchanting animated fantasy, even with the long length and some slow moments. The animation is absolutely stunning, both the hand drawn visuals and the CGI graphics give an ethereal charm to the film. The characters move more than convincingly and the colours are beautiful. The music is also outstanding, I loved the simplicity of the piano and the drama of the more dramatic parts. The story is a pleasure, I know people have complained of some loose ends, but it is an original, touching and charming one I feel. I also loved the characters. Chihiro, voiced with real enthusiasm by Daveigh Chase, is sulky to begin with, but she is also brave and resourceful, traits I like in young heroines. Lin is kind and sympathetic, and Susan Egan who was also in Porco Rosso was unusually sensitive as the character. Jason Marsden is charming as Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette is perfect as the grotesque Yubaba and as her sister Zeniba. Overall, I loved Spirited Away, it is really charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

There are many things that I gain it from watching this animation.Whether it be, great characters, that change positively throughout or climax scene which so outstanding. And a little weirdness, which keeps it interesting.That I said, I also can't wait to show it to my friends or other who never watch it before. I know they will respond to the depth of feeling and art and just good storytelling. If you watch it maybe kids or older will find it fun and heartwarming. There is excitement without seeing violence (though the giant baby does threaten, and the dragon shows up hurt badly). Cannot recommend highly enough. Spirited away is the all time blockbuster movie.This movie has great role models and messages. Great for kids who love weirdness ,and I think every all of ages can watch it Just not for overly sensitive kids.\n\nThis animation are using the 2d hand drawing all of movie ,and you will see most of place and building tone is red and orange color palettes.And the director make a noteworthy character such as No face and Susuwatari. No-face and Susuwatari are the most popularity characters of this animation that is referenced of many stuffs such as stationary,accessories or clothing etc.If you talk about what is the director's propose,I will conclude it for you.From my opinion,Spirited Away is an imaginative fantasy film. and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Since there are several layers of content and difficulties.There are a variety of symbols that can be understood. And if you watch it again at different ages.The meaning will change depending on your age.\n\nIn the last,this animation reflects me to see many sides of human like a greed and else. Then finally of this movie they just want to show that it's hard to growing up. There are many obstacles we need to face with. But finally, we all pass through.",

Maybe it's because I kept dozing off for minutes at a time, but it's really just a confusing storyline. What, with spirits, animals, hatred for humans, etc. it's really different from any other movie I've ever seen.\n\nSpirited Away also has one of the greatest scores I've ever heard in my entire life\u2026 and I've seen over 600 films so that's saying something. This score is really moving and can definitely bring tears to yours eyes in seconds.\n\nHowever might I note that this film literally made me sad for a cartoon dragon\u2026 like\u2026 if that isn't good writing I don't know what is! Hayao Miyazaki is magnificent and I'm glad my first film by him got to be his most famous one! \n\nHonestly, what's not to love about Spirited Away?
