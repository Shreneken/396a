I had watched Halloween H20 and decided to watch this as it was the follow on film so i wanted to see how it continued after H20 and also i want to say I have watched all the Halloween movies (i haven't seen them all yet or at least not all in full) but i couldn't believe how bad this film was. I cant believe i am about to say this but this film makes Halloween ends look like a Masterpiece compared to it and my respect for Halloween Ends has grown and im beginning to like Ends a lot more, even though i still think it was/is disappointing. This film however, not only is it disappointing. It is downright BAD!!!!!!! Its not even worthy of half a star",

I thought it wasn't good and below definitely average but I didn't think this was a complete train wreck like everyone makes it out like it is. Halloween 6 is FAR worse in my opinion and qualifies much more as a total disaster than this and I'll use that for a comparison. The acting in this is not good with generic forgettable characters with no charm to them. Busta Rhymes while the best thing in this is completely miscast 100%. The lead girl is just ok and all her friends except Deckard who I thought was just ok is annoying unlikeable and I honestly couldn't wait for a few of them to die. Jamie Lee Curtis is in it so briefly she doesn't really count honestly. Compare that to Halloween 6 where the acting is so brokenly bad lead by Paul Rudd's TERRIBLE performance that makes anything in this look Oscar worthy. The cinematography in this isn't good with the POV camera shots being TERRIBLE quality (This looked bad even in the early 2000's) and some some of the kills are stupid, sometimes its too dark too see anything, and there are some very questionable scenes (How did he not see Michael in the corner of the room with the flashlight). But at least this has a consistent tone compared to 6 which is all over the place and filled with terrible kills you don't even see half the time. The fight scenes with Busta Rhymes are LAUGHABLY bad. The music is ok in this and has variety that fits the genre compared to 6's constant recycled use of the Halloween theme. The editing is not good here with the the first 20 minutes feeling tacked on and not fitting the tone of the rest of the film. The POV constant shaky cam interruptions and jump scares get ridiculous in this along with random shots of Michael for no reason. Though 6's editing is FAR WORSE as it feels like different movies at times. The pacing in this is at least passable because the plot actually has a story (Yes its dumb. Could've been much better executed I feel because its a interesting idea) but it at least is simple and focused. This has a interesting idea just terribly executed. Instead of the first 20 minutes being with Lori it should've focused on developing the kids backstories and characters. Along with better acting and everything else. But what we have is a Not Good horror Sequel that for good reasons killed the franchise. Though I don't feel it deserves the title for THE WORST one. That easily belongs to 6. Regardless stay away from this unless you wanna see Busta Rhymes karate kick in this.",

While the portrayal of Myers and the mask is a slight improvement over the previous film, it's still not a good portrayal or mask. Brad Laurie is still the 2nd worse portrayal of Myers in this franchise, again in my opinion. I dont like seeing Myers eyes, and I dont like seeing Myers with an afro. The score is a step up, and so are the kills. However that's it for positives. Halloween Resurrection completely retcons the ending of H20, and says Myers switched places with a paramedic and apparently that guy was the guy who Laurie killed. That makes no sense if u had actually seen the ending of H20, because the guy could of easily took off the myers mask showing that he wasn't freaking Michael Myers. I know Myers crushed his larynx, but he should still have common sense. Laurie is killed off pretty disrespectfully in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The rest of the characters in this movie aren't engaging. They're all there just to be cannon fodder except for Sarah and Freddy. Sarah is not a very good final girl especially compared to Laurie. And Busta Rhymes character of Freddy completely destroys this film. He constantly makes Myers look like a joke the entire film. Weather he's karate kicking him, insulting him to his face, or electrifying his balls, Freddy not only ruins the film, but more importantly he ruined Michael Myers. I dont like this movie, and i would not recommend u see this.",

There is one jump scare that had me screaming bloody murder & one funny scene that seems to be meta in it's analysis of skanky teens being stalked by a lurking killer who looks on for a little too long. Those two moments aside, I thought the film did Laurie wrong by killing her character off. If they had brought her back in the very last scene, I would have been Ok with it.",

            "content": "John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.\n\nWhich is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween H20' is the one exception and the fourth film is also watchable. 'Halloween: Resurrection' is the worst offender. One of the worst sequels ever, of the genre and any genre, and one of the most pointless.\n\n'Halloween H20' was a perfect place to stop the series, to have it resurrected so badly and in a way that disgraces the 'Halloween' name to intelligence insulting degrees is enough to make the blood boil. The only halfway good thing is Jamie Lee Curtis and she and her iconic character are written out in such a slap in the face way in a scene that is anything but creepy or suspenseful. Sadly that is the one scene that actually feels like it belongs in a 'Halloween' film.\n\nCurtis aside, the acting is absolutely dreadful. By far the worst acted of the sequels, yes worse than the 'Revenge...' and 'Curse...', with the embarrassment that is Busta Rhymes being the biggest offender. The entire cast of characters are far more annoying than Tina in 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers' which is quite a feat.\n\nLaughably awful dialogue, in a script that shouldn't have been approved beyond first draft if even that, can also be found. The film is even more ineptly directed than Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers' and the non-horror scenes in 'Season of the Witch'. Visually, it is far too gimmicky that it severely gets in the way of the atmosphere.\n\nThe music, after improving drastically in 'H20', is even bigger a drawback than in the fifth and sixth films, no it is no longer one of the best assets like it was in the first four films. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and just doesn't fit in placement or in tone. There is nothing remotely creepy, tense, suspenseful or even entertaining here, the deaths cause unintentional laughs, nothing creative or shocking.\n\nThe atmosphere is just ruined by that, gimmicky filming, a paper thin, confusing and ridiculous story that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, terrible dialogue and acting, intelligence insulting stupidity (Rhymes versus Michael, the nadir of the entire series bar none) and erratic pacing (mostly dull).\n\nIn summary, should never have been made, an unforgivably poor quality and pointless excuse of a sequel and a film. 1/10 (a rare rating for me these days but this deserves it).

It stinks of cheesiness all stemming down to the core plot which does not feel like it belongs in this franchise, as well as over-the-top characters, more-so than usual.\n\nIt is common for many horror movie sequels to stem into ridiculousness, however they sometimes have something to offer, whether that is fun moments or good kills, Halloween: Resurrection (2002) has neither and draws in a side plot which feels so unnecessary just to barely reach the 90 minute mark. This is such a disappointment after what was a return to form with Halloween H20 (1998).",

Halloween: Resurrection is the final movie in this timeline (Halloween (1978), Halloween II (1981), Halloween H20 (1998) then this dumpster fire). And it's pretty easy to see why this one is the weak link. Why is this movie so bad? I'm thinking it may be because they kinda faked out people during the advertisements here and made it look like Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a main character here, but she's literally only in the first ten minutes of the movie. The beginning of this movie even redacts the events of the ending of the previous film H20. It feels cheap just to explain why Michael Myers (Brad Loree) is back. Anywho, this movie is basically about a company that hires a group of college kids to spend the night at the Myers house. The show will be live streamed with each person having cameras. That's basically the plot. The company is ran by a man named Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) and his partner Nora (Tyra Banks). The college students are Bill (Thomas Ian Nicholas) the mysterious cool guy, Donna (Daisy McCrakin) the smart chick, Jen (Katee Sackhoff) who is sort of the bossy one, Jim (Luke Kirby) the perverted dude, Rudy (Sean Patrick Thomas) the cook (I'm serious here), and lastly Sara (Bianca Kajlich) our final girl and strangely enough didn't have the ability to scream, so all of her screams were dubbed in post. Sounds like a great cast right? Also, we have one super random character in Myles (Ryan Merriman) who is Sara's internet pen pal? He's such a useless character and is only there to give us scenes of the action unfolding during the live stream. Anyways, Michael obviously comes back and before long people start getting picked off one by one. That's it. There's really nothing more to say there. The movie is always one that I remember because of the scene of Busta Rhymes using Kung-Fu on Michael. It's that ridiculous. This is a film where we have no interesting characters and the movie seems like a low budget knock off of the original. It's easy to see why this one tanked with critics and audience members alike. Is it as bad as Halloween 4-6 you might be asking? I would say it ranks as one of the worst with it just narrowly above 6 or tied for that matter. Avoid this one at all costs.",

Of course, it is not without faults, especially in terms of cinematography, (as every time the camera switches to the point of view of the \"Live\" internet camera's the quality of the picture decreases and turns grainy and almost unwatchable), and in relation to rebooting the events of the previous film via unnecessary exposition and a completely not-believable situation. However, I really think this was the only way of making another installment to the series without creating a full reboot or remake, and the filmmakers really redeem themselves after that weak set up. \nThe film is paced really well, it has some tremendous suspense, amazingly gripping and chilling scenes (such as Busta Rhyme's one on one encounter with Michael Myers, both with the mask on or Michael Myers' second murder by attacking a victim through a mirror), it stays low on the cheap scares, and makes it work by setting its story within the internet world of the early 2000's, complete with instant texting, live internet reality TV, and much more. \nMichael Myers is as menacing as ever, and Busta Rhymes, the main protagonist, becomes Michael Myers the first worthy adversary in the history of the film franchise, beating him mercilessly without the need for any tranquilizer or firearm. \nThe film is wildly entertaining and it doesn't pretend to be anything more than that. In short, the filmmakers found a way to create a new refreshing version instead of yet another overly formulaic sequel. One of the best Halloween films ever made.",

Okay so, at this point the franchise is at an \"all time low\" due to this entry but it does deliver some redeeming qualities; the cinematography and the usage of it during the deaths of the characters introduced; whom are not as badly written as H5/6 characters although still not as fleshed out or worthy for anything other than Michael Myers bait. Of course this wouldn't be a Halloween sequel without a character or characters you love to hate and whom you feel doesn't belong in the franchise; if you watch the film you'll understand. A honest pro of this film is  The Myers House shown in this movie, which is back and honestly--it's the best build since the original, it is the main setting of this instalment which makes this entry somewhat watchable. The concept of this film is what makes the one watchable beyond the atrocious Laurie Strode demise-it is a cool watch with tasteful cinematography at times and good-enough death scenes that make the most of the time given to this film followed with the soundtrack which merits the score. By the end of this film, it feels like a rehash and another reason to destroy and then bring back Michael Myers and ruin him once more...This film is nothing special, it introduces modem technology into the franchise and uses it positively to its advantage. It does make a good watch if you are looking for an unwanted Halloween film that carries on a storyline that ended on a high note before but was  carried on for another film to end it ridiculously unsatisfactory.",

He kills Laurie Strode in what happens to be arguably the worst treatment of any character in the series thus far (kill off one of the lead protagonists in the first 10 minutes by throwing her off of a building), then returns to Haddonfield to basically die. He lives in the sewers underneath his house. Meanwhile, Busta Rhymes leads an internet show in which stupid teens put themselves in risky situations for views online. It's like it predicted 2018. They do this neat thing where they have cameras set up all over the house, and Michael starts to kill all of them. It sounds cool, but it's really not.

Busta Rhymes is bad and he's supposed to be funny but pretty bad here including model Tyra Banks. The film is entertaining and not in a good way it's bad but it's so bad that it's so good.

Given that she is not integral to the rest of this bad film, she did not need to appear at all. Sad that she did.\n\nAlso, it is clear from the film that the producers were just wanting to cash in on the pop culture craze of reality TV shows, without seeming to understand reality TV themselves nor how a show like this could be conducted, like in the film, that would be interesting to anybody.

The story is a tired excuse to capitalize on the \"Blair Witch\" phenomenon of the 90's in its attempt to establish our beloved serial killer Michael Myers in a found-footage environment. The movie's kill scenes are tame, pathetic, and sorely lacking in creativity. The only perhaps slightly welcome aspect of the film is Jamie Lee Curtis's return as Laurie Strode, but even then, it looks like she's just here to collect a paycheck (can't say I blame her after the unbelievably stupid execution-no pun intended-of killing her). The least welcome turn is not even from Brad Loree, whose take on The Shape lacks any real fear factor, but from Busta Rhymes, who can't act to save his life and has the sorry task of karate-chopping Michael. Overall, \"Halloween: Resurrection\" is not hilariously bad, but depressingly so, and is ultimately offensive to dedicated fans and Michael Myers himself.

By the time I got to this point I was exhausted on Michael Myers, and the fact that this movie isn't even very good didn't help.\n\nThis is dumb. Like H2O, this movie is more like the late 90s/early 2000s slashers. So that means it doesn't age well at all. Even Jamie Lee Curtis seemed tired of this series as she wanted to be killed off at the beginning. If only the producers knew when to call it quits.\n\nI don't even know what to get into specifically, as everything about this movie is just lame. Busta Rhymes is the leading man and defeats Michael Myers with kung fu. I'm not against giving Busta Rhymes a chance, he seems to have fun and I would imagine in the right role he would have been great, but this isn't Freddy Krueger where the trash talk would make sense. It isn't even Jason Voorhees, where the Friday the 13th movies are a bit more comical and pop culturally relevant. This is a Halloween movie, and you expect it to take itself a bit more serious.\n\nNow, I like that the movie tries to have fun and doesn't take itself too seriously, as this movie would have been far worse if it did treat this material serious. However, it just feels like Michael Myers was dropped into a script that had nothing to do with him originally. Any horror movie villain could have been fit into this movie.\n\nI don't know. The series just felt tired and this movie tried to do new things that simply didn't work. It should have never been made and it didn't age well at all. I remember thinking it wasn't THAT bad when I saw it years ago when released on DVD, but re-watching it was a chore. I wanted to turn it off and by the end I just didn't care.\n\nBut maybe I shouldn't have watched all the Halloween movies in a row. It was a steep decline from the first movie, and this was the anticlimactic, sad ending to the original series.",

            "content": "Oh god no.\"Halloween:Resurrection\" stars Busta Rhymes,Tyra Banks,Sean Patrick Thomas,Katee Sackhoff,and Daisy McCrackin(great name right) and the movie is directed by Rick Rosenthal who also directed \"Halloween II\".The story to this movie is that Laurie is in a mental institution after the events of \"Halloween H20:20 Years Later\" whwere she cut Michael's head off.However,he survived by some stupid explanation that I will get to later.Michael goes to the asylum and kills Laurie.The movie then follows these college kids who decide to do an online reality show in which they go to the Myers house in which they put up a ton of cameras around the house and they also wear head cameras.Michael goes to the house in which he picks them off one by one.The plot of this movie is absolutely stupid.\"Halloween H20\" should have been the final film in the series,but instead they made another one.I don't like the idea of going to the Myers house and filming your experience at the house.It was trying to be like \"The Last Broadcast\" and \"The Blair Witch Project\",but it failed so miserably.Let's look at why it is such an atrocious abomination.First off,the acting is atrocious.For one,the acting is so bad in this movie.Busta Rhymes is without a doubt the most annoying horror movie character in horror movie history.You may say that LL Cool J was annoying in the previous films.However,LL Cool J was great in \"Halloween H20:20 Years Later\"  because he provided some funny moments and he wasn't in the whole movie.Here,Busta Rhymes was in the whole thing and he is so the point where I wanted Michael to slice his throat with a knife.Tyra Banks was also really bad in the movie as Busta Rhymes' girlfriend.Surprisingly,Katee Sackhoff wasn't even that good in the movie.The sad thing is I really like Katee Sackhoff.All the other actors are also really bad in their roles.Another thing I hated in this movie was the stupidity of the characters.The characters in \"Resurrection\" are so stupid they almost rival the stupidity of the son and daughter from \"The Purge\".While they are in the house they do stupid things,never call the police,or run out of the house.I wanted to yell at  \"GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!!!DO SOMETHING SMART!!!\".Another thing I hated in the movie  was the setting.To me,the Myers house wasn't that scary of a setting.I just hated what they did with it.They made it look like the way it did in the original film,but it feels like the size of the Myers house in \"Halloween 5\".I also hated how they killed off Laurie.It made me so mad because she was the best character in the franchise and in \"Halloween H20\" she wanted to kill her demon.Here,she falls off a balcony and Michael stabs her and she falls to the ground.She didn't even get the chance to kill Michael once and for all.It made my blood boil so much.The ending to this movie is also another stupid cliffhanger.At the end,Michael burns to death in his house and right when a nurse unzips his body-bag,his eyes open and it cuts to black.It was never followed up and so we don't know what happens next.My biggest problem with this movie was how Michael survived getting his head chopped off.Here's what happened.Michael really didn't die in \"Halloween H20\".When a police officer was coming to retrieve his body,he woke up and crushed the police officer's larynx.He then changed suits with the cop and instead Laurie cut the police officer's head off.I hate this so much.First off,why wasn't Laurie watching the cop.She knew he would wake up so why didn't she just watch the cop?Also,why did the cop have the same stab wounds as Michael and why did he tries to attack Laurie.Third,when Michael walked away why didn't anyone notice him with a bloody knife?It was an absolutely stupid excuse for Michael to still be alive.The writing in the movie is also atrocious.Just watch the last scene where Busta Rhymes fights Michael.He says these two lines:\"Trick or treat...M*********a\" and \"Hey Mikey!Happy F****** Halloween!\" .Overall,\"Halloween:Resurrection\" is a pile of garbage.This is on par with \"Halloween:The Curse of Michael Myers\" as being the worst of the series.The story is awful,the acting is atrocious,the characters are incredibly stupid,the setting isn't scary,Laurie Strode is killed off,the ending is another poor attempt at another sequel,the explanation on how Michael survived is incredibly dumb,the writing is awful,and plus it isn't scary at all.I pretend that this movie does not exist.I consider \"Halloween H20:20 Years Later\" to be the perfect conclusion to the series.It ends the Laurie-Michael story-line and it has a perfect ending.This movie was so bad that they didn't even make another sequel.This is the final entry in the original \"Halloween\" series and what a way to go with this god awful mess of a horror movie.It's just a tad bit better than \"Halloween:The Curse of Michael Myers\".Either than that,avoid this movie like the plague.\n\nGrade:F",

I mean with a clich\u00e9 title like \"Resurrection\" how are you going to take this movie seriously? Well not too seriously from the looks of it. People thought the last movie, where Michael Myers is decapitated by Laurie, would put an end to the franchise but Hollywood will do anything for more box office bucks. Even explaining in the first five minutes of the movie that it was not him but a paramedic whom Michael switched costumes with and grasping his throat rendering him unconscious and unable to talk. Isn't that the typical excuse that you would normally hear from your ten year old? \nHalloween Resurection: \"Naw aw! Michael Myers didn't die, he just um...switch places with that paramedic who you didn't see in the last movie!\"\nWell let us get this over with because watching this movie makes me even more irritable and tired.\n\nSo Jamie Lee Curtis comes back for one last appearance, but only to get killed off in the first fifteen minutes of the movie. This made me kind of upset, but at the same time kind of relieved knowing that she is calling it quits and letting filmmakers be inspired to do something new. Well they sure did something new and something stupid at the same time. The new story focuses on a couple of TV producers, played by Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks, who are hosting an internet reality show on six college kids that are spending the night in the old Myers house. Digital cameras are placed around the house and head cams around their heads. The head cams were actual running cameras even though this movie was shot on film, the often use the digital cameras to show their point-of-views. I don't really blame them for trying something new with an old franchise. Hell they even had this in the special features of the DVD where you can switch between the cameras and the head sets. The only real problem about this is that all of the characters suck in the movie and no one cares whether they live or die. The situations don't seem right either; like why would they get nude when EVERYONE is watching them on the internet, why didn't anyone call the police, why didn't they leave the house, etc. Just a lot of \"Whys\" with no real answers to any of them. However there was one scene I found to be absolutely hilarious and that was when Busta dressed up as Myers to scare the kids, but only to come across the REAL Michael Myers and he thinks it is one of his crew members trying to steal his act. I just could not stop laughing as I watch Busta Rhymes screaming through that mask while Michael just stares at him and walks away. The real shame in this is Michael Myers' final outing is getting his ass handed to him by a kung-fu kicking Busta Rhymes. Overall, this movie makes a complete mockery of the franchise and they might as well have someone throw a pie in Michael Myers' face. I have the least amount of feeling for this one, but it is not as bad as part six and that is why I give this only one lonely little star.",

However, Halloween: Resurrection is, heads and tails, the worst film in the series, and there's nothing to like about it. It's a shame too because it's also the last in the series, and instead of going out with a bang (H20), they opted instead to continue and give it a slick, hip-hop sensibility, basically tarnishing everything that was good about it. Even director Rick Rosenthal, who directed Halloween II, should've been counseled before deciding to make it (not to mention Jamie Lee Curtis). There are lots of things about this movie that are terrible, but the main three problems for me are the mask, Busta Rhymes and logic. The mask is the worst of the series, looking like a white version of Samuel L. Jackson with an enormous afro-type hair style. Busta Rhymes is also terrible, and has some of the worst lines ever spoken in a mainstream horror film. And then there's logic. What kills me is the fact that this internet broadcast is seen by everyone, and yet the only people who seem to be watching are the kids at the Halloween party. My point is that other people could probably see some of the things going on and do something about it, but no. It doesn't help that the movie isn't even scary or creepy. Just slasher garbage with no substance. It's just an awful movie.",

It sounds like a terrible idea but the execution is really not all that bad. The thing that bothered me with the exception of the first scene or two this movie did not have to be about Michael Meyers, and it may have done better by creating a new killer and distancing themselves from the countless sub-par sequels. Most of the movie works pretty well, but then it totally gets away from itself at the end with massive reality gaps and some major inconsistencies. It is also a victim of the time and suffers the same set of problems that most scary movies from the late 90s to early 00s have, most notably bad support characters. There is a lot of overacting which leads to overly annoying, flat, and dumb teenage characters that the viewer does not connect with.

            "content": "Following the success of \"Halloween 4\" in 1988, producer Moustapha Akkad immediately rushed out an unwatchably bad follow-up. Strangely, he didn't seem in a rush to capitalize on the positive reaction to 1998's \"Halloween H20\", waiting four years to produce this unwatchably bad follow-up. In the mid to late nineties, slashers were big business but by this film's release in 2002, the fad was dead. Horror had returned to the shelves of rental stores and, were it not for the presence of Curtis, I suspect \"Halloween: Resurrection\" wouldn't have made it to the big screen. This film feels small in every regard.\r\nWith \"Halloween 2\" director Rosenthal returning, there was some reason for fans to be hopeful and the opening scene gets us on board as Myers finally fulfills his wish of killing his sister, now resident in an asylum. But wait, didn't Curtis chop off Myers' head at the end of \"H20\"? She sure did, but here the writers find a \"creative\" way of getting around this. After the first fifteen minutes however it all goes downhill faster than a severed head in a laundry chute. Rhymes and Banks are a pair of internet entrepeneurs, (yes, a rapper and a supermodel, welcome to the noughties), whose company, \"Dangertainment\", has gained access to the now deserted Myers' house. They've placed cameras around the place and have recruited a bunch of teens to spend the night in the home of \"America's Most Notorious Serial Killer\". \r\nIf it's anything, (and believe me, it's not), \"Halloween: Resurrection\" is ahead of it's time. With it's \"house rigged with cameras\" gimmick it prefigures both the current found footage fad and \"Big Brother\" style reality TV. This is not what we want from a \"Halloween\" movie though. Rosenthal's direction is bland enough to highlight how much of an input John Carpenter had on \"Halloween 2\" and the writing is sophomoric and amateurish. The biggest problem is how ineffectual Myers comes across and seeing him beaten around by a rapper is a new low for the franchise. Predictably, the movie didn't fare too well, certainly not with fans, and the series would be shelved for five years. As bad as this eight installment is, the worst was yet to come.",

When characters are not speaking awkward sexual innuendos to one another in an attempt to score-- they are the one-dimensional caricatures of their most basic assigned archetypes. Plus they're all terrible actors, all of them. Also a lot of the dialogue distractingly bad ADR.\n\nThe first 15 minutes of Halloween Resurrection meant to be a passing of the torch before the title sequence even drops is decisively awful and the rest of the film is somehow even worse than that.\n\nThe plot is hackneyed, ridiculous and makes its immediate predecessor H20 look like Citizen Kane. The setting, albeit neat, was nothing more than a middling attempt to bring the franchise into relevancy in 21st century by integrating the internet reality show element.\n\nThe editing is choppy: some scene end abruptly while other make no sense whatsoever. There's a handful of neat kills that admittedly make for a couple decent suspense sequences-- but neat kills a good movie does not make. Nothing about Halloween Resurrection is scary-- but certainly funny in an unintended manner! But by the end you'll just want to forget you even bared witness to yet another cynically depressing cash grab.\n\n... and then there's Busta Rhymes.",

And for those two good reviews on the DVD cover art, I bet they came from the director himself. While not as terrible as \"HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS\", it's just about down to that level. \"HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION\" has in the opening scene, Laurie finally trapping Micheal, but she is unsure if he's the real Michael, and he kills her once and for all. The rest of the film is a TV show coming and locking a few people in a house, and wouldn't you know it, Michael returns and slaughters them all before dying in another fire like in \"HALLOWEEN II\". Gee, how god damn convenient. All I have to say about this film is that it's horseshit, should never have been made, and Freddie Harris is the most annoying horror character ever to be shown on screen. Rating: 1.5/5",

Bianca Kajlich (30 Minutes or Less), Sean Patrick Thomas (Save the Last Dance) and Ryan Merriman (Final Destination 3) gives the movie best performances. While Busta Rhymes, who is likeable at first as Freddie. But his performances towards credibility away, when he decides to use amateurish kung-fu to fight Michael Myers! He does have one funny sequence before the fight, when he runs to Michael Myers. Thinking he is fake Michael Myers telling him what to do. Bizarrely enough, he does what he is told (!) off-screen.\n\nIt is an odd sequel, at least, it is better than \"Halloween 5\" any day. Despite some clever moments, the movie just turns jokey, especially towards the end.  Listen closely when Kajlich's character electrocutes Michael Myers on his privates!

Warning bells were ringing when busta rhymes is the 1st name you see! tara banks not long after as well. when busta starts trying to do bruce lee impressions i gave up. Dreadful",

Thats all whack yo.  All i needed was a few handguns and you can say bye-bye to Myers.  But no i had to electrocute him right in the family jewels. You know what else?
