The battle of Helm's Deep is also an epic conclusion to the middle chapter that can't be forgotten. 9/10",

The cast is excellent and approach their roles with genuine authority. The visuals are amongst the finest ever seen in cinema, whilst the action set-pieces continue to dazzle. The finale Battle for Helm's Deep is jaw-dropping in its delivery. At three hours the film still manages to grip the viewer throughout and skillfully sets up its audience for the final segment.",

Throughout the years, I have seen all the cartoons, listened to the books on tape, played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen, etc. Back in early and mid 1970's, there wasn't a ton of LOR imagery and art. It was mostly in your head. This was before the Dungeons and Dragons explosion. Peter Jackson did an excellent version of these books. The characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books. The introduction of the female elf character, in my opinion, even enhanced the stories and was well acted. I wished Jackson had carried all this quality into The Hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts. But that said, these 3 LOR movies are excellent and anyone would be hard pressed to out do them for many, many years to come.",

The characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in Frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. Peter Jackson is a complete genius! Even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to Gandalf after his fall in the mines of Moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for Middle Earth as the One Ring is taken closer to Mordor and Mount Doom, can Frodo and Sam really trust Gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the Fellowship of the Ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the Kingdom of Rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of Boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. If you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and I will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, Legolas still for me and Aragorn still for my sister. Even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever, from Elijah Wood to Sean Aston to Billy Boyd to Ian Mchellen to Orlando Bloom to Viggo Mortenson to Miranda Otto to Bernard Hill to Christopher Lee to Liv Tyler to John Rhys-Davis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with Peter Jackson behind the whole wheel. After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3, can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old I get? No, not one and that is the truth for both me, my sister and our family!!!!!",

            "content": "Peter Jackson's second chapter in the 'LOTR' story is an exciting and dazzling follow-up, the rare sequel to surpass the original. It's mostly a series of chases and battles in the dark of night, sprinkled with emotional and light moments. The cast is even better than before, growing more into their respective roles. Newcomers like Miranda Otto (lovely), horror icon Brad Dourif, Karl Urban and Bernard Hill (wonderful) make solid impressions. But Andy Serkis is downright mesmerizing as the motion-capture creation Gollum. He completely sells us on this CGI character as flesh-and-blood, with depth and maybe even a soul. The evil our heroes faces grows, but so does their determination. And the thrilling finale is enough to make one say \"I can't wait until 'The Return of the King'!\"",

            "content": "My personal favourite of the trilogy\nI do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.\n\nWhen it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.\n\nThe acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.\n\nIn conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10",
