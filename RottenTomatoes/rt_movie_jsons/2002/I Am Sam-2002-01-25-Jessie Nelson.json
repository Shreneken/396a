Powerful and emotional, painful and thought provoking, Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer brought you to understand how the bridge between us as people can be built with love. The intellectually disabled needs a voice to represent them in critical times in this modern day society.",

I imagine a film such as this will have brought a lot of controversy at the time it came out, due to the actor not having a related mental/emotional disability as portrayed in the film but I did feel the sensitive subject areas covered were treated with respect. I thought this was quite a memorable film, although it is a bit hard to watch at times, again due to the films themes. It also features a nice soundtrack, with most of the songs performed having been written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and are sung by Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow etc. This film is well worth a watch for the depiction of how vulnerable people are treated in modern American society and highlights compassion at times (which isn't to say everything goes perfectly, certainly not), if nothing else, so I would definitely recommend it, even though having some tissues to hand may be an idea if your prone to crying when watching emotional films!.",

It is a beautiful story about a father who has a disability 'Sam' ( Sean Penn ) and his smart and kind daughter 'Lucy' ( Dakota Fanning ), even he is a disability but he always finds a way to support his daughter as much as he can that show the love between father and daughter. By the way, this story is not only about the love between father and daughter and also friendship too.\nActors and Actresses in this movie have the best performance, not even main actors like Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning but Michelle Pfeiffer who act as a lawyer has a good performance and also the supporting roles. All the characters have a story behind it that makes their roles are more depth so this movie is more emotional.\nThe soundtracks of this movie also one of the best parts of this movie. This movie uses a lot of songs from 'The Beatles' such as Golden Slumbers, Revolution, Let it be, Two of Us, Across the Universe, I'm looking through you, You've got to hide your love away, Don't let me down, and more. And some scenes of this movie are also inspired by The Beatles like the scenes that Sam and his friends walk across the road is like The Abbey Road Album Cover.\nI would recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch a good movie or finding the best drama movie because I could say that I love this movie like mood and tone are the best also the performance of actors and soundtracks. So I would rate this movie 10/10.",

Not because she believed it was a negative thing, but rather, her curious seven year old mind brought her to question it. I Am Sam is about a father who was left to raise his daughter on his own after he slept with a homeless woman who explained, \"I only wanted a place to sleep.\" Sam, Lucy's father played by Sean Penn, works at Starbucks bussing tables and raises his daughter Lucy, played by Dakota Fanning, with the help of his four friends, kind neighbor and community, yet there are people who doubt his ability to fulfill the needs of a child. Due to this idea that he is not mentally capable of raising a child, it creates a negative connotation towards Child Services as they take her away from Sam on her 7th birthday. The relationship that Sam and his lawyer Rita, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, share was not expected, yet it was very interesting to watch grow. At times they compared the lives of each other in which each of them faced different struggles. It really brings the viewer into perspective of our reality in this world. Everyone faces different hardships, some more than others. When first meeting Sam, Rita asked, \"I just don't know what to call you: retarded, mentally retarded, mentally handicapped, mentally disabled, intellectually handicapped, intellectually disabled, developmentally-disabled?\" In which Sam replied, \"You can call me Sam.\" This movie portrays the prejudice that people with mental disabilities face, regardless of their ability to function. Watching a family forcefully separates due to permanent circumstances is very difficult for many viewers to watch.  Because her father has a mental capacity similar to her own, there are limitations which affect their day to day lives. Unfortunately, because Sam has special needs, he faces many obstacles in attempt to raise his daughter, but according to Lucy, \"all you need is love.\" Although this is extremely true, you do need other necessities as well and because of Sam's restricting mentality, others were worried for Lucy's future. Seeing Sam and his extraordinary group of friends care for Lucy reminds me that asking for help should not be looked down upon. Because of their unconditional love and support for Sam and Lucy, they were always willing to give a helping hand, even if it included pitching in their last dime for Lucy's new shoes. This movie continuously tugs on my heart by each second and will most likely bring a tear to everyone who is watching. It is emotional, heart warming, and brings a smile to my face every time I watch it. This movie shows us that each person in this world needs love, and along with that all other things are possible. It touches on the idea of patience, persistence, and kindness from every single character. This movie is one that will teach you more than one lesson and leave you with a very soft heart.",

As much as honest and pathos its ideology is, the methods that it adapts to draw in the emotions out from the viewers is pure manipulation. \n\nThe plot track wanders in without any whatsoever connection or logic and visits pointless places for more than two hours. As it ages on screen, there is neither sincerity, mannerism and maturity in script to breed any aspects of the feature appropriately. \n\nThe screenplay is so naive and inedible that viewers cringe on seat as the makers attempt to attain a closure of their self-created destructive bubble. The primary reason why it doesn't work is its futile constant knack for drawing out a chuckle and its shallow script that it surfs through the entire feature. \n\nPenn's riveting performance is genuinely moving, to a point where it carries off the entire tale on merit and makes it worth surviving for the viewers. As much as brilliant Penn is, Pfeiffer couldn't be more distracted whilst Fanning shows some promising skills. The background score is pointless with immature camera work and daft and questionable cinematography. \n\nThe screenwriter and director Nelson not only possess sloppy writing skills with incoherent forcibly imputed sequences but also lacks execution skills which is demoted by its confused camera work. Penn is the only high point of the feature as it elevates the momentum as much as he can. \n\nI Am Sam is Penn claiming the title of being an actor, and it aches to encounter such a talent go waste by on something so fatuous.",

The scene where they bought her the shoes was both whimsical and so touching! I loved all of the movie references and of course stories about The Beatles too. And shout out to The Rocky Horror Picture Show for the Sweet Tranvestite reference.\n\nNowadays, the events in this movie are unlikely to take effect due to all of the government programs available to help those who not only are living in poverty but also have some sort of intellectual disabilities. Not to mention the fact that the courts do tend to strongly favor a child going back to their biological parents rather than a foster home even when the situation is much worse than what the film shows. \n\nThe parts that really hit home for me were when Lucy told her dad that he \"wasn't like other daddy's\", or when she was pretending to not be able to read the harder words to not her her daddy's feelings, or when the court tried to explain to Sam that he would have limited and monitored visitations with his daughter, and lastly, when Sam told Randy that he wanted to tell her a secret. The secret, of course, being that he couldn't raise Lucy on his own and thought that the red in Lucy's painting was of Randy. The emotions displayed in these scenes... were wait for it.... OSCAR WORTHY! And I damn near cried.\n\nLucy: \"I don't want to read it if you can't.\" \nSam: \"It makes me happy when you're reading.\"\n\nA very beautiful movie with a great message: All you need is love! With the lack of quality dads in this world, a lot of people would be lucky to have someone like Sam. Somebody that loves their child with their entire being and makes their little angel into their whole world. It's a typical Hollywood drama so you'll love it or you'll hate it. But can we all agree that Dakota Fanning was one of the most precious little girls ever?! She's so adorable!",

You can make a film about such a sensitive issue and cover it all up in melodrama and you can provide an ending that one might believe to be most realistic, but isn't it what most films do? wouldn't that be a cliche? But unfortunately the critics do not understand it and most of them isn't even convinced of Penn's acting.

        {
            "content": "Despite its mixed reviews, since I Am Sam is often attributed to featuring a painfully realistic performance of a mentally retarded person, I had to get a glimpse of it.\n\nI Am Sam is a film which is bound to be controversial. It deals with the subject matter of someone with a developmental disability in the position of being an adoptive father at the centre of a custody dispute. It is clearly a massive ploy for sentimentality. The film seems largely to be some kind of attempt at Oscar-bait which only worked thanks to Sean Penn's performance. In the rest of it, there is an abundance of sentimentality which really just overwhelms the entire film and its best intentions.\nThe characters in I Am Sam all end up being archetypes. The protagonist is a mentally challenged father whose mother was a homeless woman who left her child with him, his daughter is the adopted child of a mentally disabled man, his lawyer is a cold hearted woman taking on a case pro-bono for once while dealing with being a mother and the wife in a poor marriage, his neighbour is a kind elderly woman with agoraphobia , his opposition is a woman whose son suffered from a drug overdose and a lawyer who has to reluctantly live with his mother in law, and one of his supporters is a woman who was raised by a mother with the intelligence of a 9 year old. The stereotypically sentimental characters just keep on coming with no end in sight. This becomes pretty ridiculous pretty fast, and the way that the story handles the subject matter ends up too problematic. It oversimplifies the basis of issues relating to mental disabilities and custody laws solely so that it can come off as a film which holds the message \"A mentally disabled person is no different from another person.\" While the emphasis behind protagonist Samuel Johnson \"Sam\" Dawson being a great person and a capable father are true, it overlooks just how complicated the entire case is. I Am Sam ends up seeming like a film that is aimed at children as it plays it safe with so much of its edgy subject matter. It may be good for children to see it and understand that mentally handicapped people really are people too just like you and me, but in terms of how it depicts the legal system, it is just not right. The film gets really predictable really fast and is so packed with subplots and other characters that it just all piles up on itself.\nThe pacing of the film is all a big rush. So many plot dynamics are crammed to fit into the first 30 minutes of the film that by the point of it being a quarter through, we've already seen Samuel Johnson \"Sam\" Dawson pick up Lucy Diamond Dawson after she is born, father her until age 7 and then lose custody of her. It pushes through so many plot dynamics at such rapid pace that it becomes more overwhelming than it already is. It doesn't add much to the atmosphere which is already experiencing problems due to trouble establishing the right mood.\nI Am Sam is a film which clearly intends to be very melodramatic and very sentimental at the same time. But the central problem is the fact that the atmosphere ends up being a bit too light for its own good half the time and really depressing the other half. The mood is truly bipolar because it is too light some times and then very heavy the next without much consistency. There are consistently problems with the soundtrack since the drama in the film is unable to develop on its own and must be pushed along by a lot of lighthearted or depressing songs.\nJessie Nelson's directional style is really amateur, and that is the source of a lot of problems. Her script is poor and she cannot do anything with it but try desperately to make viewers cry. Those who do not get sucked into the cheap tearjerking elements of the story will much more likely simply sit in front of the screen fazed by the lack of proper thought put into the story. Not to mention the fact that visually the entire film is rather stiff due to shaky cinematography that suggests the film is in the style of a mockumentary. The editing is also poor. There is one moment where Sean Penn delivers multiple monologues in the courtroom and the editing just keeps cutting to different angles of his face for some reason. All it does is stun viewers and distract them from the narrative. I just cannot figure out a good reason for it being there. It's hard to figure out why so much of I Am Sam is all in the one film, and the viewer has to sit through it for 134 minutes to experience the entire movie. It really is just a movie in poor form, and it even has pretty obvious product placements which would point out where a lot of the financing came from.\nThe only element of I Am Sam which is really justifiable to recommend to anyone is the stellar efforts of the cast, in particular the leading performance of Sean Penn.\nThe performance of Sean Penn is truly a powerful one. Despite the fact that his effort is surrounded by an overly sentimental script and plot dynamics which fail to really get into depth about the character outside of the repetitive references to The Beatles, Sean Penn really does a fine job conveying the developmental disability in the role with painful accuracy. It is very easy to sympathise with Sean Penn because he is truly a talented actor when it comes to playing the character both as the human being he is, the mentally disabled person and the father. He puts many dimensions into the part without ever transcending the realistic limitations of a human being with a serious developmental disorder. His performance is incredibly realistic with his inabilities being emphasized yet not making up most of the elements of the character. Sean Penn's performance is alarmingly accurate with his tone of voice, line delivery and physical movements all being strongly characteristic of a mentally troubled human being. His performance anchors the film really well and gives it a sense of heart, even if the rest of the film smothers his performance beneath inexperience far from his standard of talent.\nMichelle Pfeiffer is also a powerful character. Although her character also incurs an excess of melodramatic repetition in the story, as the story progresses she is given material which is slightly more flexible and she gradually puts stronger emotional spirit into the part. She has a really hard exterior in I Am Sam which gradually breaks down more and more as viewers get a sight of what she is feeling. Her chemistry with Sean Penn is consistently strong as well, so it is good to see Michelle Pfeiffer active again as an actress after a brief period of inactivity.\n\nDakota Fanning's screen time is really too minimal because her performance in I Am Sam is deserving of serious praise. As she has proved many times, Dakota Fanning has the ability to command the screen whenever she is on it and do it in a manner which is really convincing, and that is important in a film as artificial as I Am Sam. Dakota Fanning is full of youthful charisma and natural charm in her part where she shares some powerful moments with Sean Penn, and she shows a lot of sophisticated acting talent for a girl her age. Dakota Fanning delivers a wonderful supporting effort in I Am Sam.\n\nBut despite the power of the cast led by Sean Penn's excellent portrayal, I Am Sam is overly sentimental in handling its subject matter with misguided direction and a heavily stereotypical script which degrades the serious nature of the film's subject matter.",

But later he is suddenly able to earn a big fortune to ensure a high quality of life, not to mention the forcible happy ending which Laura Dern is suddenly willing to give up and the court is not persisting anymore.

Sean Penn gives one of his most transformative performances, Michelle Pfeiffer does a magnificent job expressing subtle emotions in an otherwise not-so-subtle role, and the wonderously talented Dakota Fanning gives a fantastic little performance, and manages to stand toe-to-toe with the heavyweight acting prowess of Sean Penn.\n\nOverall, this is a performance-driven film that seems to be striving for something more; it all just felt a little bit condescending sometimes. I know this is a favorite of many people, and I truly applaud the effort from the makers of this film, because this is very treacherous territory, but it just wasn't for me.

Sloppy when it's meant to be cute, except in the case of the importance of honesty. Heartwarming but again overreaching. Sean Penn clearly did his research and is obedient in staying in character and seeming handicap. Eventually Penn's and Pheifer's characters bloom together, but her relationship with her son might be too much for the dramatic aspect. Wiest's character should have been either strongly portrayed or lef out completely, not just briefly-dramatically involved.

This is a great film with a brilliant performance by Sean Penn (who broke the rules and went full retard).  I wouldn't put it up there with Rain Man, but this is still a great film.  Michelle Pfeiffer wishes every film she was in was like this, and Dakota Fanning is cute enough to get away with playing the same role she played in every film she did as a child: the little girl who's too smart for her own good.",

            "content": "This was an incredibly emotional movie that might have been the most amazing performance Sean Penn ever gave in his career.  He plays a mentally handicapped man named Sam.  He has a daughter played by Dakota Fanning when she was little named Lucy after the song \"Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds.\"  The mother of the child runs away leaving Sam to raise Lucy by himself.  He makes a living by working at Starbucks for $8.00 an hour.  He has the intellectual capacity of a 7 year old, and they are worried that he won't be able to take care of her when she turns 8, because she will be smarter then him at that age.  When an incident goes down at Lucy's 7th birthday party, Sam gets arrested.  He is released but has to go to court to see if he is eligible to take care of his daughter.  Which creates a lot of emotion.  It gets tough to watch at times, because it is sad.  You get a wide range of emotions actually.  You feel all emotions pretty much.  There is a lot of warmth, but there is so much heartbreak.  There are about two different scenes where you may shed a tear.  I wont tell you them though.",
