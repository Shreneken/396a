    "summary": "Pistachio Disguisey (Dana Carvey), a genial waiter at his father Frabbrizio's (James Brolin) Italian restaurant, possesses an uncanny knack for mimicry. What he doesn't know is that his talent is genetic, and that he is the descendent of a long line of \"Masters of Disguise,\" all of whom have inherited the secret family gift known as Energico. Initially, Pistachio is a klutz, but little by little, he learns to harness his inherited power, and sallies forth to utilize Energico to its fullest.",

In my opinion, this movie is very poor. Some of the make-up is diverting on a mild level, but that is it. The editing feels cheap and slip-shod, the colours feel diluted and to be honest gave me a headache and the sets and effects are flat. The humour is also of quite a crude kind, including the idea of the villain breaking wind when he laughs, you can tell these are not the ideas of comedy geniuses. The direction is sorely lacking and Dana Carvey clearly looks embarrassed playing a character that is not so easy to relate to, though in fairness none of the characters are that well written at all. The worst parts of The Master of Disguise though are the screenplay which is very lame, the plot which is barely coherent and the mugging which gets increasingly desperate. In conclusion, very poor. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

The plot is hard to follow, the characters and script are unrealistic, the transitions and special effects are terrible, there are weird jokes about women's butt sizes, and there's a horribly offensive, super racist seen featuring brownface where the main character \"turns into\" an Indian man. If I had to pick one word to describe this movie it would be: stupid. Although I hate to admit I still laughed at a lot of the jokes even though I knew they weren't funny at all. There's something about the level of absurdity and stupidity that actually makes it kind of hard not to laugh. I enjoyed it ironically. Watch if you find humor in things that are stupid.

My dad also heard I liked that movie and wanted to play with me so he said he would hide first. Apparently he was already a master of disguise since that was in 2003 and I haven't seen him since.

            "content": "So my thoughts on The Master of Disguise are this. \n\nOne of the things I did like are some of the set designs. I actually thought those were very stylish. Seeing as how a production designer directed this film, that's to be expected.\n\nMy trip back through this film, however, begins with an awkward song over the opening credits and a mystical song over the introduction being interrupted by a cheesy pop song. Oh, and the opening chase is awkward as well.\n\nOne of the things that can and probably will irritate you a lot are all the accents and attempts at weird, childish speaking that NOBODY would speak like in real life.\n\nOh, yeah, one of the gags in this film is giant asses. I'm not particularly amused by it. And there's a kid who doesn't laugh to a Shrek joke. Pretty much sums this film up.\n\nOne of the things this movie does is echoing and saying things over and over again. This film really does have ADD, and for someone who is autistic, I kind of find it insulting.\n\nNow we have Brent Spiner. He's the only character in this entire film who does not speak in a funny voice, which has gotten unfunny rather quickly. He actually does a better job than anyone else in the movie.\n\nThe British imitation in the mansion really is the only disguise that has any sort of tolerability.\n\nWhat's the point of saying you're a pre-recorded hologram. It doesn't really work.\n\nOne of the things that disappoints me about this film is there was a hell of a lot of potential for a movie and franchise with this disguise theme. But it was in the wrong hands and was not used well. At. All. It just feels childish. Anything that is not childish, is either awkward, mean-spirited, or otherwise boring. I can see the style, but director Blake cannot direct and Dana Carvey did not write anything worth a dollar. I really can't believe I saw this in theaters. The only person in this entire film who has any sort of viability is Brent Spiner. He speaks normally and is the only person or thing who is not annoying. I think one of the reasons is because he's not trying to be deliberately funny. If this film is any indication, trying to be deliberately funny never works. Adam Sandler keeps doing it. It hasn't worked once.\n\nYeah, this one is pretty boring. Time for my Jeffrey Katzenberg quotation: \"It didn't work at all\". And for the record, I fast-forwarded through it.",

I could almost write a book on how mercilessly this film destroys the unwritten yet generally agreed upon rules of comedy as well as drama.  \n\nI begin by stating that I first saw this movie at a friend's house when I was about 8-10 years old.  Very young and very impressionable.  This was at a time my favorite TV show was \"Spongebob Squarepants\" and I laughed at almost anything so I was prepared for a good time.  Sadly, the movie offered me no laughs and was a complete waste of my time.  The movie is only about 72 minutes but it felt as long as \"Return of the King\" (the movie) and it was as boring as listening to the book's appendices.\n\nWhen it comes to breaking the rules of comedy, Dana Carvey's character is named Pistachiao Disguisey.  Beyond the stupid character name, Carvey makes incredibly stupid faces and impressions in an attempt to make the character come to life.  It violates comedy because its not a character acting stupid and silly that's funny, it's the situations that the character is in and how the character reacts to it that is (it's usually a negative reaction because comedy is based on some form of either physical or emotional pain).  \n\nLike I said before, I could go on about how dreadful this but I'll just sum up and say that the comedy is severely lacking, the plot makes no sense, and the movie as a whole is just a miserably failed attempt to capitalize on Dana Carvey's talent for mimicry.",

We still quote lines from it up to now, so you'll forgive my walk down Memory Line to better times and I'll do you the favor of jumping straight ahead to my opinion, 10 years later. I still cannot help but laugh at Dana Carvey's antics, and what adult viewers need to realize is that this show is really more for adults to watch WITH kids. Kids will be laughing at the antics, and the parents will smile and chuckle at the pop culture references. Of course, a slightly more serious approach without the antics would have been appreciated but its more of an unwind and laugh movie without dirty jokes. Just watch it to laugh and nothing more.",

But at the turn of the century, the laughs had all but dried up and we're left with \"The Master of Disguise\", a kids movie that is too dumb to be enjoyed even by most children.\n\nIt has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the worst comedies of all time, a dismal film that leaves you questioning everyone involved with the project. Carvey is clearly a talented comedian and impressionist, so producer Adam Sandler and the star came up with the thinnest of plots and pretty much turned him loose. \n\nThe end result is a completely disastrous, laugh-free dud of epic proportions, a kids movie that inexplicably throws in adult references in everything from \"Jaws\" to \"Scarface\" to \"The Exorcist\", and none of it is amusing. It follows the model of most Sandler movies, giving Carvey a hot love interest who for some reason finds this irritating buffoon irresistible. It's a tired plot device that is almost as aggravating as the lead performance.\n\nThe picture is mercifully short, at a brief 72 minutes with the actors continually popping up in the end credits like an annoying house guest who refuses to leave. It may seem like a blessing, as in reality \"The Master of Disguise\" feels like a never-ending experience. It wears out its welcome very early on.",

He looks like if Jim Carrey and Woody Allen had an unwanted child with the talents of a William Shatner wannabe or the aborted child of Popeye. His lack of talent was made clear in the utterly stupid \"comedy\" Trapped in Paradise, so why someone decided to give that guy the lead role in a film and a budget of $16 million is beyond me. Pauly Shore was never this bad no matter what people might say. \nThe film is crap also, because its set up with childish material which is like if Spy Kids met Scary Movie, which makes it a terrible comedy and half-assed spoof at the same time. But again, that can be brought back to Dana Carvey for writing the disastrous script that he attempted to work with for a gruelling 77 minutes, and partially for Perry Andelin Blake's inexperienced direction and inability to realise the horrendous quality of the material he is working with.\nThere was one moment in The Master of Disguise that I laughed, and it was because the scene was a paradigm of how utterly stupid this disastrous waste of $16 million was. The best thing it achieved in any area was killing Dana Carvey's career as he didn't appear in a film again after it until the Golden Raspberry Award sweeper Jack & Jill in 2011. He can stick to being a cameo and a joke, but not a film star. Not a film star.\n\nThe Master of Disguise is a master of nothing except stupidity and is one of the worst films of 2002 even though it barely got recognised by the Golden Raspberry awards for some ridiculous reason, opting instead to pick on Bo Derek for making a brief cameo in it.",

The dude WAS  an SNL cast member. He should know the basics of comedy, but he seems to forget all of it because...I think he smoked something that he really shouldn't have and got REALLY high from it. Why do you think he keeps smiling and gives out a terrible performance? The same can be said for the other performers. I am sure that they need to get paid, but this is just terrifying!

            "content": "Pre-teens will probably have fun with \"The Master of Disguise\" but for everyone else it's a near-unwatchable and embarrassing experience. The humour in the film is what really kills it and makes it torturous to watch. It's not that there aren't any jokes that work(when you throw this many jokes at the screen there's got to be at least one or two things that stick) but you'll feel ashamed of yourself for giving even a second of laughter to this train wreck. The reason why this is firmly a \"kids only movie\" is because so many of the jokes are so incredibly juvenile. The name of our protagonist is \"Pistachio Disguisey\". Did that make you laugh? Because that's one of the first jokes we get. His name is \"Disguisey\" because he is going to be a master of disguise, get it? His character is defined by another series of jokes where we learn that he likes women with big butts. This preference is in the film so we can have jokes about big butts. No, there's nothing more to it than that, the fact that he likes big butts is the joke. He's also a bumbling idiot that's barely able to wait tables, speaks in broken English (although no one else in the family does) but in an attempt to make you like the director makes sure to include several scenes showing that he's a nice guy. The fact that he is nice is only in the film so you can have villains to contrast with his personality and because if it wasn't for the forced redemption scenes you would be cheering how him to get brutally murdered within a few minutes of meeting him.\n\nMoving on from \"Pistachio\", we get an incredibly bland sidekick named \"Jennifer\" played by Jennifer Esposito. She is in the movie for two reasons: first so we can have a love plot at the end of the film (a cherry on top of the sundae when our hero defeats the villain) and second so we can showcase how nice \"Pistachio\" is when he confronts her boyfriend, a guy that's such a transparent jerk the movie only pretends he genuinely likes \"Jennifer\" for about 30 seconds before exposing him as a child-hating, lying and cheating bully. His character is taken straight out of a cartoon and is included because there is no way you would otherwise believe that the 29-year-old woman would fall in love with Dana Carvey, who was 47 when the movie was made. That's right, the man is nearly fifty but he is playing a naïve, bumbling waiter that is still living with his parents. \"Jennifer\" has a son too, who is introduced early in the film and completely disappears until the very end and is only included so \"Pistachio\" can befriend him (while her boyfriend reveals that he hates children) but it seems incredibly creepy for the two to be friends considering the age difference. Our villainous mastermind is Devlin Bowman (played by Brent Spiner), who is focused not on taking over the world, but on stealing every valuable artifact in existence. His character might have felt like a genuine threat if it wasn't for the fact that he has an embarrassing gas problem to make the kiddies laugh.\n\nSo where do our abysmal characters land themselves? In a plot that is so thin it lasts 70 minutes (that's right, the short 80 minute running time is padded out with 10 minutes of credits and out-takes at the end) and is taken straight out of every generic spy film story ever made. The plot is simply an excuse for Dana Carvey to disguise himself in a series of outrageous characters including a horny old lady, \"Tony Montoya\" from \"Scarface\" (because children will delight in the pop culture reference?), a British Nerd, a suave secret agent, a racist stereotype of an indian snake-charmer, a patch of grass with cow dung for a face and a man covered in cherries (in a sequence that makes absolutely no sense). Although the makeup is pretty convincing, the film makes the crucial mistake of casting some celebrities in the film as \"Pistachop's\" father in disguise, which completely ruins one of the final jokes of the film: Dana Carvey disguised as President George W. Bush. The jokes include such gems as Dana Carvey commenting on the size of tiny appetizer wieners and nuts, outrageous dancing, references to jaws, \"Pistachio\" getting beaten up by a training dummy and a hologram that can interact with people and reacts to the \"hilarious\" events going on around it  (despite the fact the movie explicitly explains to us that It's pre-recorded). The only thing that works in the movie is the technical aspect. The props, sets and costumes look good but everything else is total trash. Avoid \"The Master of Disguise\" unless your maturity level is on par with a 12-year-old and even then, just rent or go see a better movie. (Dvd, May 10, 2013)",

It might be aimed at the kids but but I don't think even they would find it that amusing.  Overblown characters,  overblown jokes, overblown acting,  and overblown plot. please don't waste your time by watching it.",

It's pointless for adults to review a kids movie and call it bad for being \"immature\" or \"sophomoric.\"  Guess what? Kids love immature and sophomoric humor, so the movie does exactly what it set out to do - make kids laugh.

This is such a trainwreck of a film, i want to destroy the script writers for creating such a waste of time and money. The already iffy storyline is destroyed by the unfunny antics of Dana Carvey and a band of untalented actors and actresses. \r\n\r\nThe plot is hairbrained mush, something about a guy named very ridiculously Pistachio Disguisey (whoever wrote this screenplay and created the characters is a feaking moron) who happens to be on the roof of his parent's diner when he sees his father being kidnapped. After being dumped by his girlfriend for a more macho man.\r\n\r\nThen instead of calling the police, he sits in his diner and thinks very calmly about what his next course of action should be. Then very suddenly his dog turns into his long-lost grandfather who has for some reason been disguised as the family dog for the past few years.\r\n\r\nThat isn't even the worst of it.\r\n\r\nGrandfather then tells him that it is his destiny to catch his father's kidnapper by becoming the hero disguise-artist that his father and himself are. But first he needs rigorous training and a sidekick (the sidekick must also be a twenty-something hotie who has an adorably annoying young son who likes dogs).\r\n\r\nThe rest of the film soon becomes a blur of mistakes, terrible plotting, horrible scripting and lame-ass 'jokes'. The different disguises Dana Carvey portrays had potential, but this unbelievably shameful film is no place for the characters. Some argue that the Turtle Guy is the funniest character, but to me all of them are equally unfunny, and deliver extremely cliche lines for no reason. Worst scenes of all have to be the last few in which Carvey battles various ninjas, when Carvey tries to capture the criminal disguised as a superhero, the scene with the celebrations outside the Disguisey diner and when Carvey dresses as George W. Bush in order to finally catch the criminal. This last scene is for some reason placed during the end credits, despite being a pivotal point in the story, which is just another example of how idiotic\r\n\r\nThis film is so low-life that the bin it should be thrown into will spew if it is even touched by this ugly shit.",

Strangely, his accent sounds heavier than those of his two parents, played respectively by Edie McClurg and James Brolin, who I guess has decided to leave the Oscar nominations to son Josh. The movie basically consist of Carvey (with the help of his grandfather played by Harold Gould) trying to solve a mystery by jumping in and out of various characters, some better than others, while trying to woo his new assistant (Jennifer Esposito). She eventually becomes attracted to him because she is an extremely good-looking and intelligent woman while he is a not-so-good looking idiot, therefore the Laws of Comedy naturally come into effect (if it were not for them, family sitcoms and Judd Apatow would not exist). It also has running gag in which the main villain (Brent Spiner) farts every time he has an evil laugh even though it is not funny the first time it is done so there was really no point of repeating it. For the record, I am not totally opposed to fart jokes, but I think there is a right way of doing it and a wrong way of doing it; this falls into the latter category. I think you can make your own judgement from here.\n\nTo be honest, this review is not as harsh as it could be and for two reasons. First of all, I used to watch this type of stuff all the time when I was younger and have only recently become more mature about how I judge them (sort of). Secondly, I like Dana Carvey; he was great on \"Saturday Night Live\" as well as the \"Wayne's World\" movies (he recently recaptured that former glory with his appearance in the Funny or Die video \"Presidential Reunion\"). But ever since then, he seems to have been unable to find a project that is on par with his talents. At least this movie (tried to) play to his strength, which is character acting, as opposed to having him play straight like he did in the very unfunny film \"Opportunity Knocks\". At the moment, he is only working part-time in Hollywood anyway, but if he ever decides to be more active, I hope that he gets material that is of better quality than this film. Anyway, I do not recommend it unless you are bored.",

Well just take a look at the plot, and you'll understand. I'm gonna guess you're probably like me and too lazy to actually read a detailed synopsis of it, so I'll explain it as simply as I can.\r\n\r\nYou've got the protagonist Pistachio, who is a awkward, mentally unstable little man looking to find his place in the world. His father and grandfather are professional Disguisey's. What's a Disguisey? Apparently someone that can morph into image of someone else. I don't really know if they use make-up or costumes or magic, I think it might be a mixture of all three- but who cares, thats what they do. Pistachio's parents are kidnapped and he's forced to learn the family trait of becoming a Disguisey in oder to get them back. \r\n\r\nThats kind of a crude summary the of story, but hey. \r\n\r\nYou've got to have a certain sense of humor to appreciate anything about this movie. Again, like Napoleon Dynamite, its \"beauty\" lies within its aimless stupidity, and awkwardness. The movie will leave you with memories not of crude jokes, and not of clever moments, but just quotes from incoherent scenes that you'll never get out of your head. Like it or not. And for that, I tip my hat to The Master of Disguise. I don't know what all you movie critics expected.",

My belief is that one of the only reasons why people thought this film had stupid humor is because it's old school humor.
