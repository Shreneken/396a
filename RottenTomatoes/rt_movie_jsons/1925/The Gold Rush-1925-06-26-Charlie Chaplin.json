            "content": "It started off slow but it soon picked up a lot of steam once he met others looking for gold and once he met Georgia in the saloon! This is a romance, an adventure, and a comedy all meshed together in a very creative production for the time! That never before done sequence where they're both in the house dangling from the cliff, the scene when they're all in the saloon singing Auld Lang Syne and Charlie alone at his place, and the music in general made this film shine. It's amazing that a film from almost 100 years ago can still be entertaining to this very day for those passionate about what movies have to provide, from any time! Another treasure from Charlie Chaplin!",

            "content": "\"The Gold Rush\" along with \"City Lights\" (1931) are two of my personal favorite Chaplin films and also considered his most famous masterpieces among a history of great films! Chaplin combines his LittleTramp character, here titled The Lone Prospector, with a touching and equally funny premise. Some of the most famous and hilarious scenes are found in this film and they include the roll dancing scene, Chaplin turning into a chicken and many others, all which literally make you die with laughter. No matter who you are or your place in life, Chaplin lifts your spirit and gives just as many laughs as touching and heartfelt pieces all making up masterpiece films! \"The Gold Rush\" was Chaplin's first film in which he had full creative control and it is known to be his personal favorite. It is currently rated as #58 on the American Film Institutes Top 100 Films of all Time list. I cannot say enough of its magnificence! This Criterion Blu-ray release includes the original Silent 1925 Version as well as the Talkie version, voiced by Chaplin, that he re-released in 1942. The original silent runs 88 minutes and the talkie version runs a bit shorter at 72 minutes.",

I watched the '42 version where they used narration instead of intertitles, a change I don't think I actually liked very much as they went really heavy on the narrating. The roll dance scene felt weirdly disjointed from the rest of the movie, but because of it I'm gonna be watching the entire Muppets filmography, so it'll at least be memorable for me in the end. I'm really glad I liked this one; The Kid had me thinking Chaplin tainted all of his comedies with heavy doses of seriousness!",

            "content": "A joy in the frost!\n\nDirector Charlie Chaplin's romantic comedy adventure The Gold Rush (1925) is a timeless burst of energy whether you watch the silent classic or the restoration with Chaplin's frenetic score and charming narration. Chaplin takes you from foolishly daring arctic gold mining and winter survival spoof to sweetly saccharine romantic comedy romp with effortless ease. There's real sympathy here for the poor and meek like Chaplin's beloved character The Tramp as The Lone Prospector. He glides across ice and the dance floor with equal lack of grace. Chaplin's acting is as deft as his sheer willful direction and full of fun ideas and whimsy. I'm glad Chaplin produced The Gold Rush as it remains one of his funniest films of his silent era.\n\nWriter Charlie Chaplin finds the heart of his lucky idiot Tramp with a genuinely tender and empathetic love story alongside the gorgeous silent era starlet Georgia Hale as the mean girl love interest and sympathetic heroine Georgia. Chaplin has this loveless fool charm alongside Hale's playful teasing as Georgia. I like how she hates Malcolm Waite's cruel and forceful Jack and wants an honest, kind man. The romance storyline is complex with raw dramatic emotions as Georgia brushes off The Tramp's lovely New Year's Eve dinner, when she realizes he's just the kind of guy she wants at heart. His disappointment and her guilty remorse are touching.\n\nChaplin created several of his funniest gags in The Gold Rush from boiling his shoe out of starvation to his iconic \"Dance of the Dinner Rolls\" sequence, Chaplin's surreal sense of humor is genius. He pokes fun at Big Jim's greedy wealth and Tom Murray's wicked selfishness as Black Larsen, even Georgia mean-spirited teasing of The Tramp. Chaplin always empathizes with the poor and honest against a cruel world and awful people. His inventive writing and sterling character arcs are fascinating to behold a century later.\n\nEditor Charlie Chaplin recut and restored his own film decades later adding his own pretty score with brilliant classical pieces stitched in The Gold Rush. His swift cuts make the pace faster than the silent version and Chaplin's steadfast narration has a goofy sternness that helps the quaint feel of The Gold Rush. Roland Totheroh's cinematography has all these actually beautiful wide shots of mountainsides and the harsh snowfall. I love the shot of the wooden cabin hanging off the edge of the cliff. The creative panning shots back and forth indoors give everything a loose and fast feel like the dances, chases, fights, and the dream sequence. Charles D. Hall's cabins look real enough and have a playful mobility like Chaplin's sauntering and waddling Tramp.\n\nI must mention that Mack Swain's Big Jim McKay has a hilarious comedic rapport with Charlie Chaplin's Tramp prospector. His towering stature is both frightening to witness and warm with his gentle nature. Their back and forth gag to balance the cabin is cinema perfection. In all, The Gold Rush is still a riot to watch with the family. Funny how comedy can be immortal.",

The part where the guy thinks he's a chicken and it's Charlie in a really well-made chicken costume was hilarious. Another part that really stood out to me was when he was dancing with Georgia and his belt falls off his pants and he has to hold it up with the cane while continuing to dance. He then finds a rope to tie around his pants but it ends up being tied to a dog lmao. Really creative humor from Chaplin right there. \n\nThe set pieces were really well done. Like the cabin and the way it tilted over the edge of the cliff and how it was blown away by the storm. The snowy mountain sets were really well done as well. Big Jim McKay was such a great character and a great pairing for Chaplin whom he towered over. \n\nI like how Charlie highlights how harsh and grueling the conditions were for the people that went up to Alaska to mine for gold. People starving and freezing to death. Pretty crazy. \n\nThis was a terrific, hilarious and heartwarming story by Chaplin. I loved it! He really does make timeless movies with timeless messages. My only gripe is that it's a silent movie but thankfully the music kind of plays as the vocals of the movie.",

And there is nothing wrong with it. Maybe he comes from an era like such. Or the history that he has picked up. Not even others but his own. He came from those silent films. Intertitles are a part of a narration that he can never leave behind. Hence, the constant reminder of a story being told, beautifully parted but never a stream of success. Each act is to be set up, the introduction is then reviered into a plot dilemma solved by the characterization of those characters spiraling out the very first act.\n\nAnd hence, the writer and director, Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush is split into three acts. The home, the journey and the returning of the home. The film is oddly sketched for the last act is actually humorous. And the first two incredibly intense and moving. While the first one deals with human nature, the second one is a love story that I am gullible for; instead of its known manipulative nature, either way, the affection gets to you.\n\nAnd you know it was a milestone then, when almost a century later, now, you are in the hot seat for this couple to make amends as soon as possible. I would like to mention the brilliance of Chaplin's sense of humor in the first act. He is carrying some big guns and dark sensitive material to post it as a character build up. But what's captivating is how nuanced his humor is. How much aware should you be of your content to draw out impressive chuckles like these. Between two men fighting, where Chaplin is clearly not the guy with the muscles, all he has to do is get out of that situation and not actually get out of the room, that small section of the film is him dodging all the cliches.",

His facial expressions were among the best ever conceived and his timing was impeccable. His gift for setting up outrageous visual sequences and making them believable was unsurpassed. Take, for example, the seesawing cabin perched precariously on the edge of a steep cliff. The coordination between Chaplin and Mack Swain to make the initially unrealized threat seem both legitimate and hilarious is astonishing in its detail.\n\nThen there's the influence Chaplin left on the industry. \"The Gold Rush\" contains a famous moment when Chaplin sticks forks into two dinner rolls and uses them as feet to perform a dance routine on the table top. I was aware of this sequence when I was a small boy, well before the name Chaplin ever crossed my impressionable young mind. There's also the remarkably funny gag which finds Swain's character envisioning Chaplin as an oversized chicken. Surely this was a great influence on the \"Looney Tunes\" cartoon \"Wackiki Wabbit\" in which two shipwreck survivors visualize each other as food.\n\nChaplin also knew how to spot talent outside of his own. I can't imagine anyone playing the role of Big Jim McKay as well as Swain and Georgia Hale makes a wonderful love interest for Chaplin's \"little tramp\" character. Each person fits well with each of their surrounding co-stars in a way most films can only dream of accomplishing. It's easy to see why, after one hundred years have passed since the start of his career, Charles Chaplin is still a name said with reverence in cinematic circles.",

Entirely unprepared for the harsh climate, he soon finds himself trapped in a small cabin during a snowstorm, along with an on-the-lam criminal and an increasingly insane fellow gold-seeker. That setup is good for a stretch of claustrophobic mayhem, but it's not until the storm ends and the trio split up that things start getting really good. The pace can feel slow at times, pausing to squeeze as much anticipation from each scene as possible, but that all seems worthwhile when everything comes together in the final act. At worst, it's a little drawn-out. At best, a brilliant display of creative scene-setting and cinematic trickery. Chaplin is able to do so much with such limited means, it doesn't even matter that we can see through a few of his visual illusions. In a way, that makes it even more endearing, like a magician who lifts the curtain mid-trick for a sly wink. The Gold Rush is loaded with such ideas; crazy, larger-than-life concepts that work through hustle and sheer power of will. It also bubbles over with little personal moments from the star, whose aloof charisma still shines like a beacon through so many years.",

I always assumed it would be very challenging for a silent film to hold my attention for 90 minutes so was surprised when this did not turn out to the be the case.  This is a testament to Chaplin's greatness as evidenced in his ability to entertain and tell a cohesive and engaging story with the total absence of dialogue.  There were more than a few laughs as well, and I recognized many familiar comedic tropes still being employed today.  These laughs are blended beautifully with the pity evinced by Chaplin a few moments later.  Hard to rate this one as I don't have any Chaplin or silent film history to compare this to but would probably rate it even higher if taking into account the fact this was created almost 100 years ago.",

            "content": "The Criterion DVD that I watched of The Gold Rush included two different versions of the film. I started out trying the 1942 re-release that was officially approved by Chaplin. However this was awkward and I kind of hated it. All of the intertitles were replaced with audio voiceover, and even more lines of dialogue were added in voiceover as well. It just felt wrong, and ruined the quaintness of the silent film. It was like one of those old Goofy cartoons where the voice in the sky describes everything that\u2019s happening to Goofy, but not as funny as that. So then I switched over to the original 1925 release of the film, which had some scenes that were recovered and restored which had been lost for a time. These scenes had audio and video quality a bit weaker than the rest. Still, it felt more like a traditional silent film, so I stuck with it. The Gold Rush is a little different than other Chaplin movies I\u2019ve watched. There are a few big comical set pieces, and those are the moments I loved. The most notable is the scene at the edge of the cliff with the cabin leaning back and forth. Elaborate scenes like that are what make me laugh and want to come back for more. However there was a fair amount of story going on in this film about the men being stranded in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, a girl who may or may not have actual feelings for the Tramp, a mountain\u2019s worth of gold randomly discovered and lost, and more. I wasn\u2019t as engaged by all that nonsense as I have been by other Chaplin plots. It seemed like a lot of people were taking advantage of him and giving him a hard time, and that didn\u2019t sit well with me either. It\u2019s not that The Gold Rush is bad, it simply didn\u2019t click as well for me as I was hoping it might. There were still iconic moments of brilliance in this film. Chaplin has a natural panache for taking even the most mundane moment and turning it into something special. For instance a simple scene at the dinner table is never just a meal, because with a couple of rolls and a couple of forks he creates magic. I just wish there was a bit more of that magic in The Gold Rush, and less of eating shoe leather or turning into a giant chicken. In fact, I think my struggle with this movie relates to the fact that things still felt somewhat realistic in movies like City Lights and Modern Times, but The Gold Rush was practically a live-action cartoon. And I\u2019m willing to bet all those cartoons I\u2019ve watched that have done similar jokes were just copying Chaplin, but sadly I saw them first. The Gold Rush was still fun to watch, but it\u2019s not one that I\u2019ll rush to own any time soon.",

            "content": "Chaplin's masterpiece has it all - brilliant slapstick, endearing pathos, dangerous adventure, and an improbable romance besides.  Here The Tramp is in the Klondike during the gold rush in the 1890's, and while he hardly looks or acts like a prospector, we identify with him as he endures hardship, befriends 'Big Jim' (Mack Swain), survives close quarters with the murderous Black Larsen (Tom Murray), falls for a woman who toys with him (Georgia Hale), and puts up with her bullying boyfriend (Malcolm Waite).  \n\nThe New Year's Eve scene is incredibly touching, both in The Tramp's humiliation when he's stood up by his date and listens forlornly to the celebration in the nearby dance hall, but also in the faces Chaplin (as director) puts the camera on while 'Auld Lang Syne' is being sung.  It truly is one of the best scenes you'll ever see - and on that same evening, while the Tramp dreams of entertaining his guests, he does his \"dinner roll dance\", a brilliant, iconic moment in cinema. I also love the scene where he and Big Jim eat one of his shoes after boiling it - Chaplin more enthusiastically, really digging in as if it were a piece of meat, and as if the nails were thin bones.  There are also some wonderfully dark moments when out of starvation Big Jim imagines the Tramp as a giant chicken and comes at him with an axe.  Throughout it all, Chaplin is so sweet and charming, and we root for him as the underdog while laughing at his innovative humor.  Truly deserving of its reputation, and an absolute joy to watch.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin can be argued as one of the greatest comedic geniuses of all time. By using silent comedy through expressions along with physical emotions, Chaplin made a name for himself by creating some of the greatest movies ever made. And there is no better example of Chaplin's comedy than his 1925 masterpiece \"The Gold Rush\", a wonderful little movie that not blends both comedy and drama very well, but still holds up to this day. Even after almost 90 years since its release, the movie still gets a good laugh out of audiences who watch it. \"The Gold Rush\" is a glorified masterpiece in comedy that more than delivers the distinct and unique style that Charlie Chaplin was known for.\n\nThe story involves a lone prospector (Chaplin) going out into the wilderness of Alaska during its infamous gold rush. While trying to find great success, the prospector meets up with Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), another prospector in the hopes of getting rich quickly. The lone prospector also meets Georgia (Georgia Hale), a very beautiful woman in which our protagonist fall in love. Now, he must find gold, as well as winning the heart of Georgia.\n\n\"The Gold Rush\" is a comedic piece of art, and that's saying a lot considering all of the high praise and recognition that this film has received. But what hasn't been said about this film that hasn't been said already? This is a great movie that needs to be seen. The story offers up some good comedic timing, as well as some good physical humor; it is also both funny and serious at the same time, which works towards the movie's advantage. And while the main plot is just a simple romance, this can be attributed from the brilliant direction and writing from Chaplin himself. He gives the audience some great slapstick as well as a wonderful romance that is both sympathetic and tragic at the same time. Combine this with a brilliant supporting cast, and you get one well-acted movie.\n\nSome more positives for this film include the minimal usage of sound. Since this film came out in the silent era of cinema, the movie relies more on visuals to tell its story, and it works. Through the given title cards, the audience knows what is going on exactly as they have a clue with what they are watching. On top of all this, the scenery and the sets look great, and the special effects may look cheap, but this was revolutionary back in the day. Even the pacing gives the running time of an hour and a half a good chance to let the audience know what is going on. And with all this said and done, \"The Gold Rush\" really has nothing to complain about.\n\nNow, in 1942, Chaplin re-released \"The Gold Rush\" with an updated soundtrack and added narration. But here's the thing: this version runs somewhat shorter as there are certain moments cut from the original production, and the narration feels like a modern day audiobook. It doesn't work.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Gold Rush\" is a magnificent comedy from Charlie Chaplin and is definitely a movie that everyone needs to see at least once in their lives.",

The second half of the film, which focuses more on The Lone Prospector's romance with Georgia, manages to keep all of the humor, while also adding some depth to The Prospector. The Gold Rush also gives cinema one of its most iconic scenes in the form of the roll dance, an example of humor immediately followed by something more emotionally poignant.

            "content": "Being one of Charlie Chaplin's most definitive feature length films, The Gold Rush sounded like another slapstick comedy classic.\n\nBeing one of Charlie Chaplin's earliest features, The Gold Rush lacks the political edge of his later works. You have to consider the fact that the film is 90 years old and standards for filmmaking have changed in the many decades since, but at the same time it doesn't mean that one is unjust to critique the film by contemporary standards. While Charlie Chaplin's innovative comic spirit was transcendent back in his heyday, The Gold Rush's story flaws are more obvious now.\nClearly a film with budget constraints, The Gold Rush attempts to make the most of its limited set of locations so that it may find humour in them without spending too much money. Although Charlie Chaplin is able to find clever use for them from a slapstick perspective, in terms of genuine story development there is just a sense that each scene in the film is extended for a bit too long. Though the comedy comes at the viewer with Charlie Chaplin's fast physical efforts, there is a sense that The Gold Rush is slower than it should be so that the film is able to stretch them to feature length. That length ends up being a mere 69 minutes so it is not too long, but it is still a slow experience. After an extensive slapstick intro sequence which goes on for about 20 minutes within the confines of a single area, The Gold Rush changes into being a romantic comedy which decreases the slapstick edge of the film. About a third of the movie is complete by this pont and suddenly the formula has changed, interfering with the superior nature of the slapstick setup. From there, the actual concept of the titular gold rush itself largely begins to play second fiddle to a generic love story which exists primarily for the sake of dramatic value more than anything.\nThe fact is that the narrtative is an overly simplistic tale which exists primarily to provide a front for Charlie Chaplin to deliver more vaudevillian gags, but when he doesn't deliver on them there is a tendency for the film to drag on. Only so much of a romantic comedy can be told in a silent film and even then narration had to be added as a means of helping to move the narrative along, but the quality in it is not yet at the accomplished point that Charlie Chaplin put into City Lights. It's clear that the man is still sorting out the best kind of narrative for him to work with and that for the time being he should stick to delivering slapstick because he keeps the experience lively with his engaging physical humour because it is those moments that light up the screen in The Gold Rush.\nIf you look closely at the film, you can tell that it has enough merits to succeed as a silent movie because the storytelling all goes on through the physical acting of the characters and Charlie Chaplin's ability to tell a story through imagery more than anything. But as The Gold Rush exists as a re-released film with added narration and music, this doesn't necessarily matter anymore. The musical score in The Gold Rush is just marvellous because it perfectly encapsulates everything into the atmosphere so that the more touching sentiments in the film are emphasized through the added element of a dramatic music score while the slapstick gags benefit from a more fast-paced and energetic sense of spirit. In the comedy scenes particularly, the musical score helps to build atmosphere in such a manner that it makes things progress at faster rate and therefore comes off as being more entertaining. In essence, even though a lot of the film drags on, the use of scenery and production design in The Gold Rush does effectively ensure that the story comes off as being believable while the musical score is able to establish a sense of mood to help it all flow naturally. Charlie Chaplin's film is stylish, and it manages to get around its low budget with a natural sense of humour that brings out all kinds of humour in the limited collection of situations that unfold as the narrative progresses.\nBut as expected, Charlie Chaplin's central performance is what anchors everything in The Gold Rush. Bringing his iconic tramp character to the film, Charlie Chaplin puts himself through a collection of hijinks where he has to battle to survive the harsh winter. Some of Charlie Chaplin's most iconic gags are in The Gold Rush, including the notable dinner roll dance number and an attempt to balance a house on the edge of a cliff. His dedication to being able to find the most ridiculous gags in such simple situations remains refreshing to this day. As always, his physical involvement in all the humour is something to be very much proud of because he keeps constant life flowing through every inch of the character which comes to life so consistently. The man's natural charm plays second fiddle to his hilarious ability for physical humour, engaging with the universe around him with the most over the top flailing physical movements possible. And while he is doing all this, he stays in character on an emotional level through the projection in his facial expressions which range between gleeful one moment and in shock the next. Either way, Charlie Chaplin manages to perfectly capture the essence of his character on many levels and puts the finest level of dedication into making audiences laugh, therefore directing himself to a tenaciously passionate performance which delivers on its generic contract.\n\nSo The Gold Rush admittedly stretches its gags to feature length with a slow pace and the addition of generic romance, but with Charlie Chaplin's determined physical engagement as a legendary vaudevillian comedian there is plenty of slapstick humour to justify 69 minutes of it all.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin is a film star who transcends time and not just for those who enjoy silent movies. Chaplin's movies can be enjoyed today as much as they were back when and his physical and in particular his facial expressions are top notch and a must even today for any true comedic actor. With The Gold Rush you get Chaplin at his best comedic wise, and although maybe I don't think right now I think this movie is incredible, I can still see that Charlie Chaplin is one of the best actors of all time. We see our story set in the rugged gold rush times in Alaska and Canada known as the Klondike Gold Rush, Chaplin is a lone prospector and he has come to seek his fortune like many others, but some people will help him whilst others will not.\n\nThe film is as much at times a drama as it is a comedy mixing gags with truly emotional scenes, Chaplin yet again proves himself not only a great actor, but also a director at that level too. Chaplin's little tramp persona (who kind of reminds me of a penguin) arrives to a stormy place and meets Big Jim McKay who is also a lonely prospector and Black Larsen a wanted criminal. I don't want to go into the plot too much as to not ruin it for those who have yet to see this but over time Chaplin's character comes to love, befriend and well ultimately get into some sticky situations. The story I felt was good fun and although maybe not amazing for me personally, it is still very well played out.\n\nChaplin also writes this movie further proving his absolute brilliance as he basically does everything for this movie. His skill is most plain to see in scenes where his character is being flung around or blown away by the fierce storms, the direction is not only superb but the laughs that can be had are a plenty yet again showing Chaplin's awesome humorous acting. The stunts are really well done as well by all involved, in fact Chaplin seems to make a seemingly normal stunt funny, a certain scene in a cabin off a cliff edge is probably the pick of the scenes for me. This movie also shows us some of Chaplin's most famous moments with the shoes, the dancing rolls and well of course his not unique to this movie but Chaplin's walking stick and hat. \n\nI think if you feel before watching this that you won't enjoy silent movies then think again, I myself at the time of this review have not ventured into silent's as much as I would like to have but still know from this that many are enjoyable. Is this Chaplin's greatest work? Well it could be but I do feel his movies in the 1930's are what he will be best remembered for and his highest rated although Chaplin of course wanted to be remembered for this one the most and so he should, it is him at the top of his game, and that's even before he did a lot of his more famous one's. \n\nYes this film is good in my opinion, a very likeable little adventure and although one I would not say is great, it is still very much worth watching and again afterwards. It may have aged slightly through time but in any case for a movie like this to be better than most it shows that Chaplin not only understood film making but he actually put it into action, made films people loved and cried at whether that be tears of laughter or emotion and in the end made people happy with his cheeky smile and little moustache.",

Behind that romance was comedic elements that is present to create a sense of balance; allowing it to not only appeal the minds of women but also men. The Gold Rush seems to feature the same ingredients that make up City Lights but the execution and direction from Chaplin is much greater.\n\nWhen I dive into a silent film, it always makes me nervous as I never know whether or not I would be able to appreciate the styles used at the time and whether the story would even engage me. So far, I have been fortunate to view silent films that have engaged me and have grown my faith for this era of cinema; even the short Roscoe Arbuckle films. I had two options in seeing Chaplin's The Gold Rush, either in its re-edited 1942 version that features sound or the original 1925 silent film. I was unsure which of the two was considered to be the better release as I am quite ignorant of Chaplin's works and history, but I ultimately just decided to go with the earliest release.\n\nThe Gold Rush is a much funnier film in comparison to City Lights, featuring sequences that are much more memorable and playful relationships between characters. The first section of this film deals with the idea of survival, requiring the fundamental needs but is forced inside of a cabin due to the raging snowy winds; the Lone Prospector tightly trapped with two other figures (Big Jim McKay and Black Larsen). As the feeling of hunger start to build, ideas like cannibalism and murder start to take over their minds; though dark, Chaplin keeps the tone playful, using slapstick and exaggerated comedy. This aspect of the film was by far the most memorable for me.\n\nThe film then slightly shifts into the areas of romance and loneliness, digging deep into the character and drawing out sympathy from the audience. I thought this part was executed well, I felt a real sadness in the eyes of the Lone Prospector and the way he sets up Georgia and establish their relationship was done with smoothness and tenderness. However, when this relationship starts to build and we see shadings of Georgia's character that we haven't seen before, she starts to become unlikeable, and what is more frustrating is that as an audience, we are forced to be pleased with its cheerful ending. I personally felt she was not redeemed by the film's end and it did personally restrain me from giving this full praise. Though it is difficult to keep my eyes away from Georgia Hale's gorgeous looks.\n\nThe bets quality of The Gold Rush is the music. I cannot say who composed the music for the 1925 version DVD release, but whoever it is, I bow down to your feet; it was such a treat to the ears and the emotions that the film tries to capture becomes amplified through the music and if I watched it at the right moment, I probably would have been broken in tears.\n\nSo far, Chaplin has yet to disappoint and The Gold Rush is one of the director/writer/actor's finest films.",

The chicken illusion scene must have been very original and technologically advanced for its time.\n\nOne disappointment, however.  I saw the 1942 revised version of the movie, wherein Chaplin replaced the written dialogue with narration and added a more in-sync score.  No issues with the score, but the narration spoils the movie, to an extent.  The great thing about silent movies is figuring out the jokes and plot just by the visual medium.  With the narration, it feels like you are spoon-fed the jokes and plot, and makes the whole movie feel dumbed-down.\n\nI haven't seen the 1925 version but I imagine I would enjoy that more.",

            "content": "It is not difficult to see why Charlie Chaplin's most beloved alter-ego, The Tramp, has had such an enduring legacy in the heart of cinema. The Tramp is surely one of the most likable and sympathetic characters to ever grace a cinema screen. With his baggy pants, tattered tight-coat and toothbrush moustache, he is absurd and comical in appearance. Yet watching one of Chaplin's most revered classics, The Gold Rush, I was struck by the overall depth and complexity of the character. \r\n\r\nThe Tramp travels to take part in the Klondike gold rush, only to find himself stranded with another prospector, Big Jim(Mack Swain) and Black Larsen(Tom Murray), an escaped convict. In a snow-surrounded cabin the trio get into a series of surreal and slapstick adventures, with Big Jim and Black Larsen quarreling over a gold deposit the latter has come across. One particularly funny scene is The Tramp serving up his own boot, boiled, as a meal for himself and his starving comrade. It's a bit absurd, but what makes the scene so funny is the typically deadpan nature of Chaplin's acting. His behavior suggests that there is nothing unconventional about eating your shoelaces like spaghetti. The second part of the movie sees the Tramp in a gold rush town, where he falls in love with a charming lady named Georgia(Georgia Hale). Blinded by his affection for Georgia, the gullible Tramp is unable to see that she is only playing him for laughs. \r\n\r\nOkay so now that I've rather meaninglessly outlined the plot I'd like to get to the root of just what is so appealing about this movie. Some of the comedy has dated a little, but for the most part - and not to sound like a bitter old curmudgeon here! - I still found it funnier than a lot of comedies that are released nowadays. The slapstick, however ludicrous, is painstakingly orchestrated, and the comic timing of Chaplin is exquisite. This movie contains one of his most famous bits- the roll-and-fork dance; although I'd seen this bit imitated and referenced countless times in other media( 'the Simpsons' for example) it still made me laugh. \r\n\r\nThe supporting performances are all excellent too. Georgia Hale is superb and natural as the object of The Tramp's affect, the boisterous and popular Georgia. Georgia is an interesting and challenging character. She's not instantly likeable, but her character has personality and substance. As the movie progresses you begin to see her as deeply flawed and insecure, but not entirely unsympathetic. Mack Swain is also very funny as Big Jim McKay and Malcolm Waite fits the bill as the arrogant villain.\r\n \r\nThe Tramp is an extremely lovable character who is impossible not to root for. He is the perfect comic hero: flawed but kind, hopeless yet optimistic. We sympathize with him throughout all his indignities and woes. He often seems doomed to misfortune, yet just as often seems to be touched by providence. In one early scene our oblivious hero is followed by a bear along a snowy cliff. The bear eventually disappears into a cavern and the Tramp continues his journey, blissfully unaware that he was ever in any danger at all. It's perhaps the most remarkable and quietly hilarious scene of the movie, and it also says something vital about the innocent nature of the hero. In another funny scene, the Tramp inadvertently serves a comeuppance to a womanizing bully(Malcolm Waite). Yet for all his moments of fortune, he is just as likely to end up hanging on for dear life on the edge of a cliff. His existence it seems is one of many ups and downs.  \r\n\r\nAs well as this, the character proved an interesting study in strained genteelness. In the early scenes in the cabin, while his comrades are driven to madness and violence from greed and hunger, The Tramp stoically endures. In the face of ludicrous and brutal external events he does not forget his manners. He tips his hat, adjusts his coat, and does his best to hang on to the tattered threads of his dignity. And there is just something altogether lovable about a character who pedantically wipes a plate clean, only to serve upon it a boiled boot. The Gold Rush is a sweet and moving classic of the silent movie era and it's not difficult to see why it's the movie Chaplin most wanted to be remembered for.",

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\n\nNote: There's two different versions of the film. One is the original silent version from 1925. The other, rereleased in 1942, is the same movie, but with sound effects and some narration from Charlie Chaplin himself. The version I ended up watching was the 1925 version, which was the version I wanted to see as it's the original cut of the film.\n\nSilent cinema has become a growing interest for me. After decently enjoying the 1925 version of Phantom of the Opera and was captivated by Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times and George Meliles' A Trip to the Moon, I decided to give more silent films a look (as there's at least four on my classic viewing list, Phantom being one of them). Charlie Chaplin was definitely one of the comedians to watch in the silent films I chose, especially after loving Modern Times. It's very impressive to see someone dedicated to making a film, and Chaplin is definitely one of those people. Like with Modern Times, Chaplin not only starred in The Gold Rush, but he wrote, directed, and scored the film, and he does a fantastic job. I can honestly say that The Gold Rush is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen!\n\nIn The Gold Rush, Charlie Chaplin plays his signature Little Tramp character, but at the same time, he's also called \"The Lone Prospector\", as he's in Alaska being part of the Yukon gold rush. Forced to share a cabin with two larger prospectors, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) and thief Black Larsen (Tom Murray), as due to a heavy storm. Chaplin finds himself starving and desperately looking for food. After the storm, Chaplin finds himself in love with the lovely dancer Georgia (Georgia Hale), but she's not interested in his charms. Chaplin then reunites with an amnesia-stricken Big Jim on a journey to look for more gold... and no matter the situations he gets into, the results are very, very entertaining.\n\nThis is my second experience with Charlie Chaplin (with the first being 1936's Modern Times, which I also loved). I don't know if it's my fascination for classic comedies, or my enjoyment for Modern Times, but I thought The Gold Rush was even funnier than Modern Times, funnier than some of Capra's films, funnier than The Three Stooges, funnier than any screwball comedy I've seen, and definitely funnier than so-called modern comedy!\n\nThe big success of the film definitely has to go to Charlie Chaplin, who's definitely one of the greatest comedians to ever live on this earth! No matter how obnoxious his character's situations, Chaplin makes every scene he's in a hoot! From blowing out the door due to the storm, to the infamous \"chicken hallucination\" scene, to Chaplin's bread-dancing dinner dream sequence, to a big, elaborate climax where Chaplin's cabin dangles off a cliff, every sequence is very entertaining and Chaplin nails what he does best, which is to be funny. There's a reason why Chaplin is arguably the greatest comedian ever, and it's that he has heart in what he does. He doesn't have to rely on raunchy sex jokes to be funny. He doesn't have to tell juvenile poop jokes to be funny. All Chaplin has to do is move a muscle, and he's immediately very, very hilarious to watch. \n\nWhile I still have a long way to go in experiencing Charlie Chaplin's film library (or silent cinema, in that matter), I was very impressed with The Gold Rush. It's arguably the funniest comedy I've seen; Chaplin's comedy is fantastically hilarious to watch, the dramatic moments work well in building up to the comedy (it's called a dramatic comedy for a reason), every scene is extremely memorable, the pacing is brilliantly paced, and Chaplin's direction is flawless! The Gold Rush is a rare comedy that gets my highest score (along with Bringing Up Baby, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Great Race, and Modern Times), and, from what I've experienced, it's in my book \"the comedy to top all comedies.\"",

Chaplin takes center stage once again and takes us to the snowy mountains of Alaska. Under extremely harsh conditions the tramp struggles to survive, but he always faces life with his innocent naivety and cheerfulness. The Gold Rush is a simple rags to riches story, but somehow the tramp doesn't let his social condition define who he is. He remains the same quirky character no matter the circumstances he faces. In the midst of all the hilarious moments, Chaplin always manages to send an uplifting message to his audience. He reminds us that no matter how difficult the circumstances we are going through are, if we continue to move forward something good is going to come out of it. The Gold Rush might not be his most critically acclaimed film, but it does have some of his most memorable scenes. Without ever having seen this movie I had already seen several clips like the scene where the tramp is preparing a roasted shoe or the scene in which his friend is starving so much that he imagines the tramp as a chicken and chases him. The scenes that take place in the cabin are all hilarious and have inspired many famous cartoon scenes as well. However his most famous and beloved scene involved the dancing rolls which was played over and over again in the theaters were it was played. Perhaps Chaplin is remembered for his work in Modern Times or City Lights, but the scenes in The Gold Rush have passed the test of time and captivated audiences around the world. The good thing about silent films is that they are universally accepted because actions don't need translations.\n\nThe Gold Rush takes place in gorgeous Alaska during 1898 as thousands of prospectors faced the harsh conditions in order to find gold and become millionaires. The tramp, who is known in this film as the lone prospector (Charles Chaplin),  also heads to Alaska on his own dreaming of becoming  wealthy man. After a severe storm hits his area, the tramp locates a small cabin and finds refugee there. But the cabin isn't abandoned, a thief known as Black Larsen (Tom Murray) is hiding there. Before Black Larsen can kick him out of the cabin another large prospector arrives. Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) uses his size to intimidate Black Larsen and convinces him to allow the three men to stay there until the storm passes. As the days pass the men begin to starve so they decide one of them must face the storm and bring back food. The unlucky fellow isn't the tramp this time as Black Larsen is the chosen one. After a few days the storm passes and the lone prospector decides to head to the nearest gold-rush community where he falls in love with a saloon girl known as Georgia (Georgia Hale) and tries to win her heart.\n\nThe best moments of The Gold Rush involve the lone prospector's adventures in the cabin and his misunderstandings with the other large prospectors. The love story however was the weakest link as the girl here really doesn't do anything to deserve the tramp's love. She isn't really likable so I can see how critics at the time were unsatisfied by the ending of this film. The Gold Rush could've been his most critically acclaimed film if it had an ending like City Lights. I think that film gets more recognition because Chaplin learned his lesson and ended that film on a perfect note. There is no discussion however that most of the famous Chaplin scenes come from The Gold Rush. This was Chaplin's longest and most produced film at the time and he succeeds again in blending slapstick with pathos effortlessly. The Gold Rush is a fun adventure with several highlights, but I think a shorter running time for silent films works better. Chaplin still never ceases to lose his charm and his character of the tramp never gets old. I also love the score in all his films, they are just inspiring and uplifting. After watching his third feature film, I must agree that his films are timeless and universal.",

            "content": "I'm Hungry and Cold\ntrevsreviews.wordpress.com\n\n   The Gold Rush is a Charlie Chaplin classic from 1925. As expected, the story follows \"the tramp\" (or \"lone prospector\" as he's called in this film) through a series of funny events involving love and money. This film specifically takes place in the Far North where everyone is mining for gold. The Gold Rush doesn't have the emotional resonance that Chaplin's City Lights or The Kid had, but it certainly brings the clever laughs.\n\nWhat makes Chaplin films so special is that they're timeless. The jokes aren't outdated, in fact you see the films today duplicating them. For instance, the \"hungry guy picturing someone as a human-size chicken\" joke and the \"girl waving hi at you and it was meant for her friend behind you\" are things we've seen before, but The Gold Rush still makes them funny. Even with Chaplin's slapstick, we've seen slapstick in every single comedy today and, to me, I find it stupid and not funny. However, Chaplin's slapstick has this delightful charm that tickles you inside.\n\nProbably the most famous scene in The Gold Rush is where Chaplin is in a cabin that is teetering on the edge of a cliff with a fellow cabin mate. Not only is it funny to watch Chaplin struggle to maintain his balance while trying to figure out what's going on, but it is also an example of groundbreaking filmmaking. The way Chaplin manipulates both the set and the camera to make the audience believe the house is actually teetering back and forth was amazing for that time. As I was watching this film, I couldn't help but think about what the audience back in 1925 must have been feeling. Not only were they watching some incredible piece of filmmaking, but they were witnessing something historic that would still be remembered in another 87 years.\n\n   The Gold Rush may not live up to great silent comedies from Chaplin's fellow artists Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd (or even Chaplin himself), but it's still charming and delightful. The great silent film star once said \"A day without laughter is a day wasted.\" Thank you Mr. Chaplin for a day well spent.",

The script and the screenplay are just as creative as they come, which was all know they come Charlie Chaplin style, making you laugh all the way. My favorite scene in this movie is where the house was hanging on a cliff, with the Lone Prospector and Big Jim trapped inside. The movie boasts of such amazing screenplay, especially that specific scene.\n\nChaplin's movies have received numerous recognitions for their work and appeal, this movie is no exception it got an Oscar nomination for Best Sound Recording, although it is a silent film. In 1942, Chaplin re-released the movie and in this new version, he added a musical score and a narration which he recorded himself, the original version was a silent film done in 1925.\n\nThe movie's plot is about a character named The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) whose desire to venture into Alaska to look for gold led him down a path of adventure where he discovered gold and fell in love. In his adventure he met Big Jim McKay and Black Larsen and during a storm all three were trapped in a cabin. \n\nWhile they were tapped in the cabin, they ran out of food and Larsen went out to go search for some, while Big Jim almost ate the Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin), as Larsen wasn't back in time and he Big Jim was hungry. The movie then carried on, at the end of the storm, Big Jim unfortunately loses his memory as he battled with Larsen at one point while the Lone Prospector went into town and fell in love with a girl he met at a saloon named Georgia.\n\nAlthough Gold Rush is fun and a nice movie to see, but it is not as great as City Lights which was done six years after. Gold Rush was a box office success gaining over 4 million dollars. The movie made over four times its production cost and it is featured in the AFI's top 100 movies of 100 years (10th Anniversary Edition), there it is rated 58 and it is rated the 25th funniest movies in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs.\n\nCharlie Chaplin has been a wonderful actor, director, writer and producer in the many movies that he has done; this is just as much a classic as the others. Gold Rush is fun to watch and you will find yourself laughing your way through.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

It's certainly the greatest of Chaplin's oeuvre.\r\nThe Gold Rush is a film of delicate balances, never struck with such ease as within this wonderful, wonderful movie. The Gold Rush came between two other Chaplin classics, The Kid and City Lights. Both are magnificent in their own right, but The Gold Rush shakes the creaks out of these two styles and balances. Managing to drop the episodic awkwardness of The Kid and retain the unpredictability lost in City Lights, the film could be called surreal, or even epic.\r\nChaplin was possibly the most brilliant of all entertainers. His films can make us laugh one minute and sob the next, and The Gold Rush is the ultimate argument for his cinematic power. Chaplin will live forever in our hearts, and may his films grace the silver screen for years to come.",

The Gold Rush is about a poor man, Charlie Chaplin, who struggles through life until he becomes rich. The story is great, funny, interesting, whatever you may like to call it, but what should grab your attention is how a ninety-percent-silent-movie (narrated only) in black & white can make you stare at the screen for so long without waiting for someone to talk, or actually not wanting anyone to talk anymore. This is how you can tell an actor can actually act or not. Charlie Chaplin wanted everyone to remember him for this, The Gold Rush, and it is the most famous movie of his, alongside City Lights of course. Georgia, Chaplin's love in this movie, is a person i did not like very much for some reason, however, Chaplin did show affection for her that i don't think any of those High School Musical kids could ever show to their own parents! He makes you feel that he cares about her in real life too and makes you Google her now and see if she is still alive. You'll be doing that a second after finishing The Gold Rush.

It's so simple in storytelling terms but you still manage to find such wit and charm to it that you find it intriguing right away. I've also only seen the original 1925 version thus far and not the 1942 version, so I have a feeling this review will change once that has happened. I don't see how much more it can be improved with the inclusion of sound because it's already a fantastic film. Unfortunately it was lost for decades but a major reconstruction using elements from all over the world took place in in the mid-1990's to bring it back together again using the film's script, director of photography's notes and other sources. It's still incomplete due to it still missing a few frames here and there, but the final version comes across very strong and is well-worth the effort that was put into it. I highly recommend this charming piece of silent comedic cinema to anyone looking to have a good story told to them in a delightfully entertaining way.",

The place is cold, windy, and harsh, but it all melts away due to the warmhearted humor. Chaplin's rich asset is his proletarian appeal and unlike his modern peers, he displays it not by dumbing down the material. Shocking.\n\nChaplin connects at a more human level. He understands the trials of the poor and it is them that he tries to cheer up the most. Whether it be starvation, working hard, or wooing a girl, Chaplin elevates life's commonality into a fun art form. His scenes are crisply directed, relying on timing and situational complexity. And the guy is such a nimble performer with a legible face that says more than what a dialogue can deliver.\n\nThere are a lot of people, even some self-proclaimed film buffs, who would never watch a silent film. It's a pity, really. When I first saw Chaplin's \"Modern Times,\" I was such in awe - more awe when I saw \"Avatar\" in 3-D. His movies aren't really literally silent to me anyway.

            "content": "Charlie has often been quoted saying that this is the film he wanted to be most remembered by. And it's absolutely the perfect film for him to be remembered by.\r\n\r\nThe Gold Rush sets the Tramp as the \"Lone Prospector\" trying to find fortune in the snowy alps of the Yukon. After getting trapped in a snowstorm, his luck changes when he meets and falls in love with one of the local girls, who unfortunately won't give him the light of day.\r\n\r\nBefore I get into the review let me just say that there are two versions of this film. There's the original completely silent version. Then, there's the re-edited 1942 version that has narration by the man himself as well as a different score.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gold Rush is my absolute favorite Charlie Chaplin film. Why? Because it painstakingly showcases what made Chaplin a genius, and everything it showcases is absolutely amazing. It's his funniest, most touching, most uplifting, most impressive film of his career. Well, it's not his funniest, it's more like it's second funniest. But there are such a ridiculous amount of ingenious moments that it much more than makes up for it. What makes this film so special is that Charlie's most iconic, influential and popular gags can be found here. There's the chicken hallucination, the boot dinner scene, the snow-shovelling scene, the dancing saggy pants scene, and of course, Chaplin's greatest moment, the dinner roll dance.\r\n\r\nIt's one of my favorite scenes of all time. It's just the greatest thing EVER! There's something about the look on Chaplin's face, the brilliant pantomime that's completely captivating and hugely hilarious. The scene has been recreated many times, but nobody even comes close to touching Charlie's scene. It's the pitch-perfect display of Charlie's talent and ability. The way he communiactes with his eyes, his little glances, the subtle arm movements and the perfect precision of the actual steps is nothing but brilliance. The dance is more than enough to make the film worth seeing. But unless you're an unfeeling zombie of a human being, then it's not the only reason to see this film. Charlie's incredible ability to effortlessly mend together romance, slapstick, and brilliant storytelling is dumbfounding.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't seen the film yet, then I recommend you seek out the original version first. Well, actually if you buy the DVD, it should have both versions. But I do like the original better but in some ways I don't. The ending is better in the original, and the sound (without narration and with a better score) is better. Although, there is a strange change in the story that I feel is much better in the later version. If there was some way to combine them (sound of original, story of later version but with the ending of original) it would be perfect. The later version with the narration isn't bad, it's actually still really great. It's just different. The original feels more familiar and watching Charlie feels more \"at home.\" It's how it was meant to be seen. Even so, the later version is still great. I suppose it's a matter of taste. Some people find narration annoying. I don't. So, see both versions!\r\n\r\nWith or without narration, Charlie is always a giant ball of energy, charm, and hilarity. I could watch film twenty times a day and still never get sick of it. It never ceases to amaze me how prolific he is at making you laugh, feel, and smile. A masterpiece in every sense of the world.",

No doubt Charlie Chaplin's, The Gold Rush, is one of the best example of this.\r\n\r\nThe story is actually more entertaining and heartfelt than most of the modern comedies in recent years. Charlie Chaplin plays the Tramp and goes to the Klondike in search of gold and finds himself some humorous situations. Chaplin alway plays his characters with such grace that imitating him is just impossible. The jokes are actually funny, the characters are worth caring about, and since it's a Chaplin film, prepare yourself for some of the most hilarious moments ever filmed.\r\n\r\nWhat else can I say about this movie, it helds up really well. Unlike most comedies where the humor dies off with passing years, this film has only gotten better. I have to say the best thing about this is the production value. Every characters is worth watching, every shot captures the scene perfectly, the pacing is just terrific in every way possible, and it's just a joy to watch. I honestly can't remember the last time a movie has made me laugh as much of this.\r\n\r\nThe Gold Rush proves that comedy can timeless if done correctly. Even though the current state of the comedy genre is not so good, it's great that a talented artist like Chaplin made this movie for generations to smile, laugh, and bring them an unforgettable experience.",

Such a wonderful film, this should be mandatory viewing for all.  Highly recommended!\n\n- Such a classic film that anyone can enjoy and features some great Chaplin bits such as him eating his shoe and doing the dancing rolls.\nWatched the 1942 re-release version which is shorter, but I think the it plays at a faster speed, not sure if there's any other difference.\nCheck it out!",

The Alaskan setting is an awesome place for a film, but this felt like just a string of gags and I didn't laugh as much as I have at other Chaplin films and they didn't have as much ingenuity as Keaton typically puts into his gags (the teetering cabin gets closest).",

Just from this Chaplin film (I saw the '42 Bluray version from Criterion, beautiful by the way; I guess it's truly not a \"silent\" movie) I can see where Looney Tunes got a lot of its inspiration comically. I've seen some of the set pieces before, clearly through cultural osmosis and parody of The Gold Rush, but these are the original gas, and must be valued for that. I must say I liked Chaplin putting spoken narration and film score to the film; I also wouldn't mind subtitles for other silent films, but I'm getting the feeling I'm not going to like \"inter-titles\" so much; plus I feel like it'll break up the flow of the comedy.

The Little Tramp is an amazing character. The Gold Rush follows him as he treks up to Alaska to find gold. Instead, he finds himself lost in a storm. He enters a cabin of a wanted man, and instead of running away scared, he tries to make him leave so he has a place to stay. They end up staying together along with another man who comes along. But they are starving. One man must go out and find food, which happens to be to wanted man. When he is gone, they are starving. The other man thinks Chaplin looks like a chicken at first (which hilariously ends up being Chaplin in a giant chicken suit), then he doesn't care that he's a man, he is just hungry! The other fun part of the film is the Lone Prospector seeing Georgia for the first time and falling in love with her. She is way out of his league. Everyone wants her, but she is bored with her life and the town. The Lone Prospector is someone new, right? Or at least that was the first thought that crossed my mind. He has been on a crazy adventure so far, can't something ever come easy to Chaplin? Nope. That's the pictures, isn't it? I loved it when he found Georgia's picture on the floor and tries to put it in his pocket, but one of the men keeps staring at him, making him too nervous to do anything with it. Georgia seems to be interested in Chaplin when she asks him to dance with her, but there is a lady's man in town whom she goes for instead. \n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nThe man from the cabin comes back and asks Chaplin to help him get back to the cabin and find the gold he left behind. This comes to my favorite part of the house being on the ledge of a cliff. They have to run to one side, or else the house will tip over. Hilarious segment. When they survive and find the gold they become multi-millionaires. They go on a ship which they are both dressed fancy now. Georgia happens to be on the same ship. I was worried this was going to be like The Circus where Chaplin would leave her and tell her she would be happy with someone else, but of course since he has the money now he can take care of her. It's really interesting the way that Chaplin does it. It feels almost bittersweet. It's good that he got the woman he loved, but it also feels bad because he can only have her because of his money. It works because she writes the apology to him and says she loves him, but connected to The Circus it's still a sad thought. I have only seen 3 Chaplin films now, but this definitely deserves to be towards the top of his list.",

As usual Mr. Chaplin creates a dramatic comedy that makes you laugh out loud, and with this one it really does, but also brings a tear to your eye -not literally on my experience-. With hilarious slapstick, a warm and sincere story and Chaplin's classic character The Tramp, the film is a wondrous piece of silent cinema. Taking place around 1898, a time of the gold rush in the story, the weather is extremely wild and our character is on the quest for gold, although he does not succeed in finding much. This is another one of Chaplin's finest films because of it's sincere comedy full of delightful and humorous acting. As much as some will say that Chaplin's character is recycled, which is true to some degree, but it's a character that I love to see. Chaplin in his later years did move on to making films outside his Tramp character, but it is one of the earliest great creations of Cinema, a character who really connects with people. Thanks to the great writing the character never does feel re-used as he's always put into a different situation.\r\n\r\nFull Review:\r\nhttp://movierelatedblogs.blogspot.com/2011/06/silent-film-marathon-7-gold-rush.html",

It's what hits an existential vein in Charlie Chaplin's \"The Gold Rush\". As if written in the stars, the melancholy bursts like a line of oil, and still makes time to wave away sorrows by deign of air on an empty night. Through a fantasia of mortal imagery, Chaplin builds a hopeless romantic of every slapstick buff. In behavior Billy Wilder would later follow, \"The Gold Rush\" turns larger than life with help of humorous import. Chaplin stays in regular bust, and the movie seems to catch him for all the better.\n\nYet it hardly sticks to a center. Chaplin plays a nameless prospector midst the 1898 Yukon gold collective, but journeys mostly in the throes of a gorgeous city slicker named Georgia (Georgia Hale), and the tricks she and friends play on the Little Tramp. Still, Charlie fights for her, the likes of boyfriend Black Larson (Tom Murray) coming into play. Here, \"The Gold Rush\" seems to split. Lost between the sharp riches of mountain explorer Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) and croon for Georgia, the film finds magic in both the momentary and transcendent. Each trip to the dance hall, where Charlie first meets his crush, there's the shape of a soul in every savory line of dialouge that would hurt the innocence of the atmosphere if all the points didn't align so well. So Georgia's infliction, positive and negative, as well as Larson's vapidness pay due to the same reality. Chaplin's bag of mischief breaks only in his own haunted realization. It'd happen, too, if the world weren't full of different corners.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: I actually watched two versions of this, the original, uncut silent version from 1925 that runs 96 minutes (given today's projection speeds), and the re-release version from the 1940s which includes spoken narration written and performed by Chaplin himself, which has a 69 minute running time. \n\nI'm not really sure which one I liked better. The original drags on (or seems that way), but with the re-release, sometimes the spoken narration, though amusing, is way on the nose and a little overbearing. It's shorter, but doesn't always feel that way.  I think I might like the original more, though regardless, I'm gonna be honest and say that this film (regardless of version) is overrated.\n\nYeah, I know it's a sin to say such a thing, but I can't help it. I still really enjoyed it, and yeah, it's a wonderful landmark piece of art, but it didn't really seem all that hilarious to me. Maybe it's just because silent films aren't my thing. I saw a few before I watched The Artist, but that film kinda made it really hard for me to appreciate the real deal. I think I appreciate the silent era more than I actually enjoy it. In the broad annals of history though, this film is undeniably important, but as an isolated piece of entertainment, it's great, but not a Full 5.\n\nChaplin does his usual schitck here, though this time his Tramp character is credited as The Lone Prospector (even though he retains his trademark outfit), and the film follwos him as he tries to cash in on the adventure of seeking gold in the Yukon. Leave it to Chaplin to make struggling through some major hardships funny. Not only do he and other desperate men have to deal with their own greed and mistrust of one another, but they have to fight off the elements, starvation, and just general madness.\n\nAnd yes, a lot of this is really funny and amusing. This is one of those films that's been so influential that when you finally see it, you're like, \"Oh, so THAT's where this funny bit comes from!\" This happened quite a bit while watching this, and I'm mostly referring to the fork/dinenr roll dance seqeunce, hallucinating that someone is a piece of food and trying to eat them, and being in cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff over certain doom.  \n\nI swear, this film must be in the Top 5 of Most Influential/Ripped Off List. Seeing the bits in their original context is great though, and Chaplin and crew are tremendous when it comes to slapstick. I'm not really that big a fan of this type of humor, but I know the good stuff when I see it. Probably my favorite bit is where two guys are fighting over a shotgun whose barrel always end up pointed at The Lone Prospector, no matter where he moves around to. It's a scream.\n\nAre far as the technical aspects of things, this is also a top notch producction. Yeah, it hasn't aged wonderfully, but that is part of the charm, and that's what, I think, makes it more endearing than just the humor. It's sad how much the modern age and digital technology can take away from the hard work and artistry of the filmic craft. \n\nOkay, I'm getting rambly. You should probably see this, if only for default reasons, but even then, it's a really good film. Like I said, I'm not the biggest fan of slapstick, and silent films do take a lot of getting used to, but they're really a lost art, and it was nice for me personally to finally see a full Chaplin film. The dude was a one of a kind, and it sucks that there's really no one like him around anymore.",

On the edition doing the rounds now, Chaplin himself narrates the film but originally of course, the images (along with some music) had to speak for itself.  One of the reasons why Chaplin's film career worked so well in the talkie period as well as the silent period was because he had a great voice anyway.  It is said many silent stars could not make the transition to sound because their voices were not strong enough for the mics.  In The Gold Rush then, we hear Chaplin's great voice narrate 'the little man' in kind words adding a great depth to the picture.  Famous scenes like Chaplin boiling then eating his own shoe are here as well as some glorious slapstick as he fights Georgia's love interest at a dance.  A great film of course, but perhaps not up there with The Great Dictator or Modern Times as his very best.",

As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen. But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramp's world is where City Lights falls short. It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with. To my belief Gold Rush is the best of Chaplin's works and I will watch it over City Light just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime. I will justify my point with four unbelievably brilliant scenes from this film-\r\n\r\n   1. The one in which he dines on an old shoe. Chaplin's exquisite grace, turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast: he carves it carefully, smacks his lips in anticipation, and then eats it with gusto and appreciation, sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti.\r\n   2. The one where Big Jim McKay and Charles struggle to get out of their cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff. Its funny? Oh yes! But the underlying camerawork is unmatched. Oscillating the camera and moving the characters accordingly, and the way the final scene is shot when Charles jumps off the cabin the moment it falls down :) This film was shot in 1925\r\n   3. The scene where Charles shows a dance to his imaginary dinner guests using two bread rolls stabbed with forks. They look perfectly like the boots he wears. Perfect!\r\n   4. The scene where Chaplin goes to a great deal of effort to prepare a New Year's dinner and is stood up by his date, spending his New Year's alone. This scene is almost unbearably sad, thankfully it is surrounded by scene after scene that had me giggling.\r\n\r\nWhat a delightful film! I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches. Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic. This masterpiece is not just a comedy but an adventure in its best form. There are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them, like the eating shoe scene, fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun, and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene. When Chaplin finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments. I genuinely felt for him. Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time. Brilliant!",

The tramp, also known as The Lone Prospector in the movie, played by the great Charlie Chaplin, while searching for gold in the mountains run into all sort of troubles and adventure, from falling in love to fighting a giant bear.\r\n\r\nThis was my first Chaplin film. I watched this last year I think and Mr. Chaplin immediately got me. Congrats, Mr. Chapling, you've got yourself another fan. Since then I've watched a couple of other of his films, but this one might be his best. Today I remembered about it and I decided I wanted to watch it again. The second time wasn't as great as was the first, but the film itself is still fantastic. \r\nTo start with we have Charlie Chaplin's charismatic and funny performance as the tramp, the character that he has played so well in the past. He is very funny, as usually, and his heart and spirit can be seen on his character. His humor is not only funny but also heartfelt. There is hardly any film these days that at least tries to be as good as these Chaplin films were. He is a legend, in every sense of the word, as all of us have heard. His adventures as the tramp keep amazing us now almost one hundred years after. And the character of the tramp is not only well played, but we can all sympathize with him. It is his foolish nature and his kind heart that keeps us loving him (in a non romantic way if anyonewas wondering). His adventures, his troubles, his stories are all humoristic to us, but there is more. They are human, we can relate with him at one point or another. They all have a heart, a spirit, something we don't see this days. This might be the best comedy ever made. Not because it is the funniest (but it might be too), but because of its heart as I already have said. \r\nCharlie Chaplin is a master of cinema, a legend as I've said before. He is not only one of the greatest actors, but one of the greatest directors too. He is definitely the best comedy director. \r\nSo now I'll watch more of his films. The power of a re-watch. I think I've seen already three or four, but I'll try to see more. My father has a Chaplin collection (that's how I saw this one), so I'll start watching them. Expect more of Chaplin reviews, lol. \r\nSo Chaplin has the level of a legend, and he very well deserves it. This is my favorite Chaplin film from the ones I've seen, but who knows, that may change. This film has a full 100 per cent. Long live Charles Chaplin",
