    "summary": "To find out if his reality is a physical or mental construct, Mr. Anderson, aka Neo, will have to choose to follow the white rabbit once more. If he's learned anything, it's that choice, while an illusion, is still the only way out of -- or into -- the Matrix. Neo already knows what he has to do, but what he doesn't yet know is that the Matrix is stronger, more secure and far more dangerous than ever before.",

Barney Stinson as a main evil character oof.. oh well with a different plot it might've been a good choice. Wich is the next point: The additional story is none existent. It had so much potential. If there was no other matrix movie before I'd give this one 3 or 2 mediocre stars. Considering the predecessors this one doesn't deserve a better rating.

            "content": "A pesar de que todo acabo en la tercera pel\u00edcula, Matrix regreso con esta pel\u00edcula que si bien haya gustado o no al p\u00fablico, da a entender que cada vez que un conflicto termina, siempre empieza uno nuevo. Se trata de una pel\u00edcula muy diferente donde ya han pasado muchos a\u00f1os y todo ha cambiado. En la vida las cosas siempre cambian y las pel\u00edculas tambi\u00e9n. Uno de los puntos d\u00e9biles de esta pel\u00edcula es tener solo a Lana Wachowski a cargo, ya que Matrix ha sido creada por 2 mentes y parece que fue un reto dejar esta pel\u00edcula a cargo de solo una de las mentes responsables. La pel\u00edcula juega con el espectador al inicio, llegando al punto de casi romper la cuarta pared llena de met\u00e1foras sobre la sobreexplotaci\u00f3n de una saga conocida e indicios de lo que Lana paso durante la creaci\u00f3n de esta pel\u00edcula solo para complacer a la Waner Bros. Nos presenta lo que ha sucedido despu\u00e9s del final de la trilog\u00eda y una nueva Matrix que explora la condici\u00f3n humana a trav\u00e9s de las emociones. La Matrix del inicio siempre iba con base en la exploraci\u00f3n de la naturaleza humana de modo matem\u00e1tico, como si los humanos fueran solo algo cuyos movimientos y acciones se pueden calcular fr\u00edamente. Aqu\u00ed tenemos una Matrix que explora la humanidad con base en las ilusiones que generan las emociones humanas. La filosof\u00eda de esta pel\u00edcula es en como las emociones nos hacen creer en falsas esperanzas al punto de vivir en un sue\u00f1o o una falsa ilusi\u00f3n creado por nuestro subconsciente. Parad\u00f3gicamente, esto involucra el factor nostalgia que esta pel\u00edcula gener\u00f3 en su estreno a todos los fan\u00e1ticos de la saga. Eso hace que esta pel\u00edcula sea bastante curiosa y la forma en que parece contar nuevamente la trama de la primera pel\u00edcula, pero siendo un nuevo inicio para una nueva historia que comenz\u00f3 con el final de la trilog\u00eda original. Keanu Reeves y Carrie-Anne Moss hacen un buen regreso a la saga manteni\u00e9ndose fieles a sus personajes, aunque tenemos a un Neo que reci\u00e9n regresa y tiene que volver a recuperar sus fuerzas. El Morfeo que todo conocimos ahora es reemplazado por una versi\u00f3n digital del personaje que es una hibridaci\u00f3n del Morfeo original con el Agente Smith, aunque no est\u00e1 a la altura de Laurence Fishburne. Finalmente, tenemos un Agente Smith reconstruido y redise\u00f1ado que ya no parece ser una amenaza, pero nos hace extra\u00f1ar al Agente Smith de Hugo Weaving. Los efectos visuales son sin duda lo mejor, hay buenas escenas de acci\u00f3n, pero no tan excitantes como en las pel\u00edculas anteriores y la banda sonora es decente a\u00fan sin Don Davis. The Matrix Resurrections es una nueva ampliaci\u00f3n al universo de Matrix, pero que en comparaci\u00f3n con las dem\u00e1s pel\u00edculas acaba siendo una secuela hecha solo para explotar la fama de la saga. Mi clasificaci\u00f3n final para esta pel\u00edcula es un 8/10.",

            "content": "The Matrix Resurrections was an exciting watch and would have been an interesting standalone film. But it couldn't seem to decide if it wanted to pay homage to the originals, or leave them behind. It built on previous plot points but used a totally different tone and style. It used new actors, but played the part of old characters. The plot became rather confusing towards the end, and the exposition started to become visibly convenient for telling the story. Many of the decisions of the characters became confusing as their goals became muddled and the audience was left unsure of what to root for. What does Agent smith want? What is he doing there? Does Naomi want safety for IO, or to use it's resources to rescue neo and his girlfriend? What does neo actually want? The originals made what was desired clear: freedom.\n\nThe action was well choreographed but didn't seem to get the respect and space it deserved within the film. Fight scenes were crammed together with little foreplay, contrasting to the originals in which fight scenes were slowly built into (cast your mind back to the subway fight between neo and smith, which took a big chunk of the original), with the viewer getting no time to develop an appreciation of the gravity of such events. It's a problem many mainstream (and less critically acclaimed) films now have - they forget to breathe. There's no time for the viewer to get attached and instead we're thrust right into the action, which is ironic in this case, because the Matrix 4 seemed to be making a commentary about this very behavior in our day-to-day lives as we pull the shroud of endless Tiktok and Twitter feeds over our eyes and away from reality (or maybe that's just me.)\n\nThe film started off promising, this time once again leaving the viewer in a state of doubt as we witnessed Thomas Anderson wrestle with past memories of Neo, but the curtain was quickly lifted as the script became visible in the form of flat, unnecessary dialogue and marvel-style jokes. The original films set a serious tone, one that allowed a sense of derealization that was left with viewers, which was probably what cemented its place as a sci-fi classic. \n\nThe Matrix has a rich universe that is waiting to be explored, as glimpsed by some of the excellent work in the Animatrix. It is a shame this film did not better explore this, beyond some of the 'sentients' that were now living with humans. It would have been exciting to see some of the events prior The Matrix.",

            "content": "\"The Matrix Resurrections\" is the fourth installment in the highly popular and beloved \"Matrix\" franchise. The film is directed by Lana Wachowski and stars Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Neil Patrick Harris, among others.\n\nThe plot of the film follows Thomas \"Neo\" Anderson (Keanu Reeves), who is now a shell of his former self, living a mundane life as a game developer. However, Neo soon discovers that his previous life in the Matrix may not have been a dream after all, and that he must once again fight against the machines to save humanity.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of the film is the outstanding performances by the cast. Keanu Reeves once again shines in his role as Neo, delivering a performance that is both nuanced and powerful. Carrie-Anne Moss also impresses in her return as Trinity, bringing a much-needed sense of emotional depth to the film.\n\nThe action sequences in the film are also incredibly well done. From the breathtaking fight scenes to the awe-inspiring visual effects, \"The Matrix Resurrections\" delivers on the excitement that fans have come to expect from the franchise.\n\nHowever, The Matrix Resurrections falls short compared to the original, and there are also some notable weaknesses in the film. The pacing of the story feels a bit uneven at times, with some scenes dragging on while others feel rushed. Additionally, the film's attempts to explore new themes and ideas, while admirable, can come across as heavy-handed and confusing at times.\n\nOverall, \"The Matrix Resurrections\" is a solid addition to the franchise, with some truly standout moments and performances. While it may not be as groundbreaking or memorable as the original film, it is still an enjoyable and thrilling ride for fans of the series.",

Very rarely are movie-goers treated to a perfect homage to a revisited franchise, while adding a fresh take and perspective on the source materials. Here is the idea of literally resurrecting a franchise, explored through a film. A perfect commentary for the current state of big motion pictures in this film era. Resurrections is like both a reboot and a sequel, in that several characters' actor portrayals are rebooted, while at the same time keeping in tact their original story-line from the original trilogy. This makes for an interesting reflection of self and identity. Hate to sound woke, but as we know, the Wachowskis have always explored what it means to be you and your definition of yourself. The matrix franchise has constantly explored having an identity that's incongruous with how others perceive you. Lana was able to continue the story of the original trilogy while also introducing new actors, unlike many requels that simply bring back the old, tired cast, or recast a bunch of gen-zers. So why isn't Hugo Weaving playing Agent Smith, or Lawrence Fishburne playing Morpheus? The film addresses that. They are deceased. The Morpheus in Resurrections is an NPC designed by Neo that became self-aware after Neo programmed him with that ability. The Agent Smith in Resurrections is a new Smith created by The Analyst because it became clear to him while creating the new Matrix that there was a special bond between Neo and Smith; basically, one cannot exist without the other. I wager that many people dissatisfied with the film do not actually know these plot points, which is still arguably the fault of the filmmakers, but it's not completely unsubstantiated by the screenplay and lore. It's possible that those audience members who despise the film are in fact, living in the newly created matrix.",

To alleviate this I rewatched the third one as a refresher, along with my cat shengy. Upon completion of aforementioned third installment I strongly felt this was two hours of my life I would never get back, but still held a glint of hope for resurrections to right these wrongs. It did not. The wachowski family now owe me another two hours of irretrievable down time. In retroflection, I now also feel the second film nowhere nearly stood up to the magnitude and ground breaking cinematography of the original, which I feel was amazing.

Ultimately, it all becomes about saving one person at the risk of the world, as opposed to risking one person to save the world, as what happened in the third film. \n\nWhile I like the first Matrix film just fine, it's never been anywhere close to my list of favorite movies. Maybe the die-hard Matrix fans will be able to get more out of this than I did.\n\nThe movie is called \"Resurrections\". As if to indicate this property had been dead or simply on life support, finally brought back to life. But this feels more like a dead body being buried in the cursed earth of the forbidden \"sematary.\" Now it's back from the dead; the flesh is living, but the soul is spoiled. It plays out like someone's pipe dream fan fiction, making up its own rules while still finding a way to be highly derivative and unoriginal. \n\nUltimately, this feels like one time where it would've been best to simply take the blue pill, and leave things the way they were.",

Me parece que el principal divisior de esta pel\u00edcula esta en que puede llegar a ser un poco pretenciosa, profundizando dem\u00e1s los di\u00e1logos y haciendolos confusos sin raz\u00f3n. No hay un planteamiento real que justifique todos los di\u00e1logos en la pel\u00edcula, muchos se seinten forzados y de m\u00e1s en la cinta, como si se basaran en la superficialidad para crear capas en la historia; llegando a precer en varios momentos di\u00e1logos ir\u00f3nicos. Como la escena del la p\u00e9lea en la que hay un personaje que dice cosas al aire para \"maticar\" el conflicto exterior de la cinta con WB, que desde mi punto de vista no me parece ingenioso tener como conflicto principal, un conflico personal del autor, que solo entender\u00e1 el espectador que este al tanto de las noticias de esta pel\u00edcula, ojo todos los directores (o la gran mayor\u00eda) modifican echos reales para crear su historia, hasta en la misma cinta se hace referencia, pero el problema est\u00e1 en que Lana Wachowski no exteriorisa su porpio conflico, no lo adapta a la historia, lo hace parecer como un berrinche, el discurso no se amolda a la trama y no se siente natural, y ojo conflico externo si crea una buena trama que va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de ser algo externo para profundizar la pel\u00edcula, ya que es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil que el p\u00fablico entienda el mensaje o lo capte, porque un conflico externo afecta a todos. Para mi la trama se basa m\u00e1s en la busqueda el empoderamiento interno y en forjar nuestra identidad sin inspirarnos o imitar las tendencias (Libera tu mente), con la ya cr\u00edtica al capitalismo que las dem\u00e1s cintas venian arrastrando, con una que otra alegor\u00eda interesante. Con lo que me quedo en esta pel\u00edcula est\u00e1 en el montaje, cada escena ya sea de exposici\u00f3n del conflico o de acci\u00f3n, tiene planos interesantes que se hacen muy din\u00e1micos con la historia, que se agradece sobre todo en las escenas de acci\u00f3n, con una paleta de colores oscuras y furtes en la que prioriza el azul que me pareci\u00f3 hermosa, no me aburr\u00ed de ella en toda la pel\u00edcula, y para mi le da una profundidad en la im\u00e1gen muy interesante que se vuelve agradable y en varios momentos impact\u00e1nte de ver.\n\nPara Mi Matrix 4 se hizo como una cr\u00edtica a la sobre explotaci\u00f3n de contenido actual, con Reboots y contenidos sin originalidad que buscan ser m\u00e1s un entretenimiento masivo sin una cara real, que una producci\u00f3n que busque darle un mensaje al espectador, que en varios momentos funciona pero en otros no, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la fotograf\u00eda esta 4 entrega no tiene otro apartado en el que sobresalga, Matrix 4 podr\u00e1 ser original pero sin contar una historia que realmente sobresalga de toda la masividad de contendio que tenemos actualmente.",

It seemed so political, as if everything they said had nothing to do with the original plot of the movie, but everything to do with trying to stick it to someone.  They turned the characters inside out into some twisted lgbtq freak show, to intentionally display some sick show, in another way, as a second underlying chip on the shoulder.  It was just a weird freak show, which was seriously just embarrassing to watch....When i saw the trailer, i was so horrified, I didn't ever want to watch it, and when I eventually did, I was somehow hoping it wouldn't be as bad as they seemed to portray it, but it was unfortunately far worse.  Unfortunately, there's no more guessing the future matrixes, they're all just matrixes within matrixes with tranny and other lgbtq freak shows and stick it to everyone else, for messing up the original movie!",

            "content": "The 1999 \"Matrix\" was not a good film, it was the standard for a good film. The original idea was so good that it held on two sequels that, with all their imperfections, together form a unique trilogy. Unfortunately, we also received the fourth half-sequel, half-remake of the mentioned movie, which, if it had any spirit, could be called a parody rather than a serious film. But, we have what we have, now at least we got a standard for a bad movie, and an example of what kind of movies should not be made. It has already become proverbial for Hollywood to record \"woke\" propaganda, instead of slightly watchable and entertaining achievements.\n\nTo paraphrase a line from the film that best describes the reason for this misdeed itself: \"Warner Brothers decided to shoot a sequel to the Matrix trilogy, with or without us.\" Surprisingly honest, nothing else to say. Apart from the original John Wick, pardon, Neo and Trinity, the rest of the cast consists of comic characters who, all together, can hardly bear the epithet of actors. The script and dialogues, on the other hand, are written in such a way that no serious acting would help.\n\nThe vain repetition of scenes already seen (and literally), a patched plot full of holes without any meaning, rather bad effects and a change of the original coloring are just some of the troubles this film is dealing with. It was also expected that the original story will be altered, so we find out that Neo is actually not the only \"One\", but that they are, in fact, Neo and Trinity, but, above all, Trinity. Everything in this film goes downhill, from the very beginning to the uninspiring ending. Cheap, just as check-out music is cheap compared to the original by RATM.\n\nIf you only can, don't waste time with this movie. It is better to spend it, for example on \"Spiderman: No Way Home,\" and see how a fun sequel to a franchise can be recorded, with an original approach and a real look back at previous sequels. I am far from favoring so-called actors like Tom Holland or Zendaya, but the film is at least craftily done properly.\n\nThe only sympathies for this film are for reminding us how good the first \"Matrix\" was, by showing scenes from the original realization about every five minutes. And that's probably because there is nothing better to see here anyway.",

            "content": "It was a daring idea to create a sequel to The Matrix that actually doesn't feel like a Matrix movie. The goal here is to reference the franchise legacy but still look like a new original experience. The idea sounds good but here it doesn't really work as the movie itself doesn't know what to be instead of a Matrix movie. A lot of the movie feels like an afterthought, lacking enough development. There is one particular moment when a character of the previous movie appears in the most random way screaming things that do feel like an improvisation while staying out of any interaction with the main cast before disappearing for good. The main villains disappoint too. Jonathan Groff doesn't have the same level of intimidation as Hugo Weaving, which is a big miss for the movie. There is another new villain too but he has too much personality and human quirk to feel like a \"mean program\". At one point, this same villain talks about having \"inside jokes\" but with who? how robots can have inside jokes? The action scenes can be fun but most of them don't live up to the memorable level of the other Matrix movies. That said, the action still is a good diversion after some very long and boring explanations that are too present in the movie. The movie is still worthy of your time if you liked the franchise, the scene between Neo and Trinity are great, their chemistry and their acting are amazing. Trinity especially shines in each of her appearances. Also, the new character, Bug, played by Jessica Henwick, is a very fun one and a pretty good addition to the franchise. Also the main theme this time is that people want to live in their own world, their mind, instead of facing reality which is pretty good for a movie that is so meta towards the first movie where the theme was the possible fakeness of our reality but Revolution doesn't develop this theme despite talking few times about it. Don't expect too much though, as many people thought, this movie seems to be the beginning of a new franchise. In Matrix Revolution, only a few things will be resolved by the end of the movie, and some important obstacles will be a little too easily cleared.",

The beginning was a struggle to watch, a boring and lengthy story line taking ages to get to the point.  Could have cut most of the scenes down to 15 minutes.  After a few short naps in between the movie, the bits I woke up for didn't get any better.  From what I saw there would be no reason for me to put myself through more wasted time trying to get through the movie in its entirety.  My thoughts anyway on this movie set was that the first movie started on a high and as they went along the gradually got poorer so it was unfortunate that this movie carried on the trait.  I go as far as to say this was the poorest of them all.",

The characters, old and new were well written and the action sequences were great without relying too heavily on cgi. My biggest complaint is that i didnt like the casting of Johnathan Groff, i think hes a great actor just not a great fit for the role he got.

There are talented people in this movie that look awful because of the aforementioned pace and the directing.  The director should fire herself.

If this is what comes from the \"original\" creation of either Wachowski (or both), then they probably stole most of their success.\n\nSomeone actually mentioned the flop Jupiter Ascending as one of Lana's projects.  Compared to this, that movie is highly enjoyable.  This one is borderline torture for anyone that actually cares about the original masterpieces.\n\nAnd NO, it's not clever.

I was absolutely blown away by this film and it is certainly one of my all time favorites. The sequels were not quite as good but definitely still had their moments of action, intrigue, and spectacle. After seeing Resurrections I'm now convinced that they never should've gone beyond the original. Resurrections makes Revolutions look like Citizen Kane, despite all the flaws the trilogy's finale had. I knew this latest entry to the series was not going to be as good as the original trilogy, but nothing could've prepared me for how bad this movie actually was.\n\nThe first red flag is the fact that this film has to constantly remind you of how much better the first film was. About a third of the film is either trying to sloppily recreate the most iconic scenes and imagery of the first film, or is literally just showing you those scenes within the film. Then there's all the \"meta\" self-awareness the film has, which could have been a clever plot device but is done in such a painfully cringy way that it feels like they don't want you to take this film seriously. Neo's powers are completely nerfed and it's pretty obvious that Keanu is now too old to do kung fu. Agent Smith and Morpheus are just cheap knock-offs of Weaving and Fishburne, and I can't blame those two for not wanting to return to this trainwreck of a sequel. Instead of the Architect we have the \"Analyst\" who is an actual exposition machine and explains any necessary plot points when the story needs to move forward. There are a lot of cool ideas like a machine civil war that get briefly mentioned and then are never spoken of again, even though these could've been fascinating concepts to explore. The new characters are like forgettable NPCs, which is fitting considering that the film's first angle is to say the Matrix was just a video game. They even introduce one of the most cliche concepts they could possibly throw into this franchise, zombies. Yes that's right, there are now zombies in the Matrix. You might be wondering if at least the action is any good... well, it isn't. The fight choreography also feels like a huge downgrade from the entire Matrix trilogy.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this movie, from the script, to the casting, to the execution, and so on. It's a nostalgia-bait cash-grab that destroys everything the franchise had worked to achieve, and based on Lana Wachowski's statements this was probably intentional. I understand wanting to make a commentary about the film industry, sequels, etc., but that could've been accomplished without creating such a disjointed mess. This is one of the most disappointing sequels ever made, if not the worst sequel in the history of film. I'd prefer to be like Neo and believe that this movie is not real.",

            "content": "Idiosyncratic notion: C. It was energizing, philosophical, testing, and made a moment brand out of the Wachowskis, the composition/coordinating kin who had already guided one non-mainstream film. The Matrix sequels, Reloaded and Revolutions, became a shorthand joke for swollen imaginative error. They were talkative, draggy, and simply not what fans were expecting to see when jacking once again into this bizarre world, and years after the fact, I believe they're worth a basic re-assessment.\u00a0The Matrix Resurrections just made me miserable. A film feels angry at its own initiation. Thomas Anderson is carrying on with his life as an honor-dominating match originator. His organization and colleague, Smith, are searching for their next success, and they're taking a gander at Anderson's greatest achievement... the \"grid set of three.\" It was a computer-generated simulation program that speared the distinction between the real world and fiction. Mr. Anderson could play or even put together the part of Trinity with respect to Tiffany, a lady he has become charmed by over the long run at a bistro. But Mr. Anderson is experiencing difficulty figuring out what is genuine and what is just in his mind. That is on the grounds that a new, more youthful Morpheus is letting him know that he's Neo, that he's bound for more prominent things, and that he's been kept in a strange jail to keep him out of the activity. What is the reason for this, and what has happened in the long time since the end of the conflict with the machines? Part of my battle with Resurrections is that it also battles with its own reality, and not in a meta-text based kind of character emergency, more like a motivation to carry on 18 years after the fact. This film is far more meta than you might think. The whole first hour of the film highlights characters advocating rebooting \"The Matrix,\" the game. It's a film where characters loquaciously discuss parent organizations' going ahead with the IP regardless of the inclusion of the first makers, so it's better to be the one attempting to resolve the drain, I assume. A person, in a real sense, says Warner Brothers needs another Matrix and they won't stop until they get one. There are characters that lounge around a table and attempt to separate what made the first Matrix so bleeding edge, and each individual has an alternate brand trademark.\u00a0There are strict minutes from the 1999 film that are introduced as though the characters in the framework are watching The Matrix to reproduce scenes like energetic cosplayers. There is one section where a person simply begins shouting \"reboot\" with irreverent expectation, promising to get their own side project as a danger. Media outlets' parody about reboots and cash-get continuations is interesting yet lost and coming according to a viewpoint of insubordination. In the event that this was all the film was, it would have been an intriguing illustration of a craftsman's wearing the extension to their best establishment out of obstinate disdain. In any case, assuming we had our own little center gathering and asked what made the first Matrix so agreeable, I question whether anybody would list, \"media outlet parody and meta humor.\" We have another Morpheus and another Mr. Smith, but did we really need either of them? Whenever they make a cursory effort to design themselves after characters of old, it feels stressed, it feels gassed, and it's another example where Wachowski broadcasts to her crowd, \"Look, the studio requested I bring back these characters, but I'll be doomed assuming I know how to manage them.\" As a result, Morpheus has somewhat more story influence as an impetus for taking Neo back to his way of edification. In all honesty, I don't actually know half of what was going on in this film, which comes up short on the rich availability of the best activity motion pictures, connecting circumstances and logical results, and pushing the film forward to its unavoidable conclusion. Indeed, even the earlier films felt more like the makers realized what was happening, regardless of whether the crowd was lingering behind. With Resurrections, it seems like Wachowski and her screenwriters, author Dave Mitchell and Aleksandar Hermon, have recently quit any pretense of attempting to sort out everything. Another failure is the absence of any signature or vital activity groupings or, in the expressions of the Matrix round table, minutes that \"took your breath away.\" The utilization of telephones as transport all through the grid has been supplanted with reflect entrances and entryways, which at first let my imagination run wild. It also feels like another component that scarcely enrolls. The film takes the anybody-can-turn-into-an-agent danger of the first set of three. The new machines choose to depend upon a collective conscience means of getting anything people are nearby and assuming command over them as careless troopers. Let's look into what kind of minimization this is. The last venture includes a heightening of the collective conscience, yet we've previously been here with the numerous Agents Smiths of the continuations. There is one upsetting change-up where the machines acknowledge how people can simply act as standard feed. That is dull. However, it is a more viable assault. Indeed, even the essential combative techniques like fights and gravity-challenging wire work are modest this round. Assuming there is one thing that resurrections truly do well, it's marking their character out as a sentiment. A significant part of the last part focuses on the connection between Neo and Trinity, which was generally underestimated in the spin-offs. It was a sentiment of more utilitarian reason, giving Neo an affectionate interest to persuade him to be saved in the midst of incredible risk. The film Resurrections really carves out an opportunity to devote to Neo and Trinity as individuals with desires and what they would see as engaging about each other. He's not the hero of humanity, and she's not his entryway to information and strengthening. They are portrayed as individuals who are somewhat dissatisfied with their lives and simply hoping for another chance to meet at their favorite coffee shop for another energizing discussion. The development of the film puts much more significance on this human association, so I'm happy time has at long last been given to investigate what it is that interfaces Trinity and Neo, particularly assuming their romantic tale will play as conspicuous a goal as Resurrections. On the off chance that you have never thought often about Trinity and Neo as a couple, you'll probably be in for a brief half-life. From a specialized viewpoint, resurrections are still a banquet for the faculties. The photography is ill-humored and airy. The melodic score is siphoning. The embellishments are cutting-edge. There are a ton of gifted individuals dealing with this continuation. So why then, at that point, does the film feel so spur of the moment? In some respects, every Matrix continuation has had this impression, adding incidental pieces to a generally amazing independent film. Having re-watched both Reloaded and Revolutions once more, I can positively pronounce Resurrections to be the most fragile Matrix passage yet. We were all all too unforgiving of the earlier two Matrix motion pictures, which missed the mark in catching the first's enchanted speculative chemistry, but brought the products with regard to noteworthy set pieces, eye-popping visuals, and account zigs rather than zooms. They are still all too stodgy and babble nonsensically, but there are distinct major ideas permeating under them. Conversely, Resurrections feels more fueled by disdain, with Wachowski's returning to this world against her better wishes and decisions. Perhaps we ought to have let things be.",

Yes, Agent Smith is now a tech bro douche because they couldn't get Hugo Weaving back and anyone trying to imitate him would have fallen short.

It just got way too convoluted, and whilst I more or less followed it I'll need to re-read the plot on Wikipedia to get my head around the finer points. The brilliance of the first half (which I'd easily give 5* to) fizzled out, and we were left with something that was a bit boring, illogical and poorly executed, with the dialogue even getting a bit hammy.\n\nSo overall a 3* rating - if it could have kept up the quality of the first half this would have gone down as a historic sequel, but sadly it fell short, a bit like Neo's failed jump in the first film :-( Definitely better than the two original sequels though.",

            "content": "A nostalgia fueled revisit of The Matrix that's very hit or miss.\n\nDirector Lana Wachowski's sci-fi action-adventure The Matrix Resurrections (2021) is a good movie that I enjoyed much of, while absolutely loathing certain choices. Wachowski's direction only has that sleek neo-noir style from The Matrix during the scenes within The Matrix, while the real world segments feel dull for Io just like Zion from Reloaded and Revolutions. I do appreciate Lana Wachowski returning to direct with some style of her own and providing some heart to this story. However, The Matrix Resurrections has as many problems as it has enjoyable scenes.\n\nProduction designers Hugh Bateup and Peter Walpole beautifully recreate The Machine City and people pods, while The Matrix office and cafe sets sucks horribly. Io looks just like Zion: hideous. Some of the visual effects are remarkable like hands going through mirrors, machines plugging into people, characters appearing or morphing suddenly. However, the bullet dodge CGI and slowing down effects look cheap and rough. How can The Matrix effects look worse now than 20 years ago?\n\nEditor Joseph Jett Sally's montages cutting back and forth between the old Matrix movies and the new ones are obnoxious and terrible. Generally, the editing is dull and unimaginative without real tension or pacing in mind. The Matrix Resurrections starts with an unbearable first 40 minutes with insufferable new characters that could easily have been cut. It did not need to be 148 minutes long at all. The Matrix Resurrections could have had a quick montage to demonstrate that Neo is unhappy in The Matrix and felt like reality was not real, then gets the red pill from Morpheus and gets to the interesting plot. I hated the opening, loved the middle section of The Matrix Resurrections that has new plot, places, and ideas, then felt cold about the lackluster ending.\n\nI hated how the conversations are shot like television episodes, yet there are some striking wide shots with real mood from cinematographers John Toll and Daniele Massaccesi. Neo rising from the machine pods or walking in the rain at night look incredible like the original Matrix films. However much of the martial arts fight choreography is basic and not thrilling like the old kung fu. The gun shootouts are pretty dull and the final riot attack is pretty boring. This should have been so easy to look and feel cool! The fast paced, action packed, and brilliant science-fiction sequences are just not here within The Matrix Resurrections.\n\nThis movie was obviously mandated by Warner Brothers, so Lana Wachowski directed and wrote what she could come up with to not let them create something completely terrible. Instead, we got a creative movie with some fresh sci-fi ideas, bland action, half awful acting, and a jaded perspective.\n\nWriters Lana Wachowski, David Mitchell, and Aleksandar Hemon clearly resent Warner Brothers as well as fans of The Matrix for wanting another Matrix sequel. The meta references and jokes are horrendous, unfunny, unimaginative, confusing, and hurt the otherwise serious tone of The Matrix movies. The Matrix Resurrections carries a contrived, jaded, and cynical perspective without much hope compared to The Matrix Trilogy. Neo and Trinity's romance needed to be developed further as we barely got any Carrie-Anne Moss until the end! I kind of loved how the machines resurrect and recreate Neo and Trinity's bodies. This film needed more interesting ideas like that or humanity's last remaining city Io living in harmony with humans and machines. I do not appreciate Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, or even the actress that played Sati not getting to return to their respective characters. Their absence is notable.\n\nKeanu Reeves is pretty good as Neo once more in The Matrix Resurrections. He's sometimes really awkward or bored, but he delivers a serious and thoughtful performance as Neo realizes the consequences of what he's done or how the world changed or didn't. Neo should have been allowed to fight with some complex kung fu more as there's very little action surprisingly. He's still got romantic chemistry with Carrie-Anne Moss, but they needed more screen-time together. She has not aged a day really as Carrie-Anne Moss is absolutely gorgeous still and a cool heroine with her iconic Trinity. Carrie-Anne Moss is fantastic as Trinity once she gets to fight, but she's wasted having her pretend to be Tiffany. Hopefully, if there is somehow a fifth Matrix film, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss can be together the entire film.\n\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II is serious and gripping as Morpheus, but I just wish Laurence Fishburne was asked back as his iconic black hero. Morpheus' fight with Neo in the water dojo is pretty neat. Jessica Henwick is wonderful, beautiful, and cool as Bugs. I wish she wasn't forgotten about by the end and given an even bigger role as she's charismatic, cool, and funny. She gets how to make Bugs feel intriguing and strong with a worry for the future as she believes in Neo like the old Morpheus. I am certainly surprised at how cute and fun Jessica Henwick is in The Matrix Resurrections. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Jessica Henwick are definitely pleasant standouts from The Matrix Resurrections as far as the new cast is concerned.\n\nJonathan Groff is so average as Agent Smith. He does not have Hugo Weaving's charismatic delivery, heavy enunciation, distinct voice, fearsome presence, or captivating gravitas. I could not help but think how cool every line of Smith's would sound if he was played by Hugo Weaving again. Neil Patrick Harris is fairly gripping and often funny as The Analyst. He's a great improvement on The Architect's obnoxious personality and dense dialogue. Priyanka Chopra sounds like she's just reading her lines off the script. She's the worst performance in the entire movie and I'm shocked she was used to help promote it at all. They should have gotten the Indian girl who originally played Sati so charmingly. She could not possibly be worse than Priyanka.\n\nChristina Ricci looks breathtaking and she's so funny! How does she only get like two lines of dialogue then she disappears? She would have been way better than any other person in The Matrix. They could have at least made her character Gwyn de Vere an agent or something. Jada Pinkett Smith is both engaging and awful as a newly jaded Niobe. She's not brave or loyal at all anymore. Telma Hopkins is okay as researcher Freya. Chad Stahelski is terrible as Chad, but it's a quaint cameo, I guess. Lambert Wilson is surprisingly terrible and raving as The Merovingian. He used to be one of the best parts of Reloaded and Revolutions. Brian J. Smith's Berg is boring. Toby Onwumere's Sequoia is somehow worse than Tank or Link. Max Riemelt is likable as Sheperd, but he does nothing. Er\u00e9ndira Ibarra's Lexy is very pretty and rather emotional, so I'm surprised she's barely used in The Matrix Resurrections. Andrew Lewis Caldwell truly awful as the meta spewing game design dork Jude. He's unbearable. Honestly, half the cast is insufferable, while the half that is great are underused.\n\nComposers Tom Tykwer and Johnny Klimek's score is underwhelming, honestly. I miss the grand symphonic pieces from Don Davis or Juno Reactor's exciting techno songs. Where are all the exciting, beautiful, or memorable themes or melodies? Surely they could have had pulsing synths or something for The Matrix Resurrections? Sound design is both corny and slick with some robots sounding neat and other action sounds coming across as goofy. Lindsay Pugh, Caroline Hill, and Javier Arrieta's costumes are so boring and ugly compared to any of Kym Barrett's classic Matrix outfits. Where is all the leather, latex, and black fabrics? This looks so ugly and modern. The make-up team ensures everyone looks older, that's for sure.\n\nIn short, I'm not impressed by the overall execution, but I appreciate The Matrix Resurrections ambition. I wish it had more striking visuals like the actual resurrection or thrilling action like Neo fighting Morpheus.",

            "content": "Are you hoping for an answer to the ending of Revolutions? Well you do kinda get one... Neo and Trinity are alive, but I kinda wish they stayed dead so that this movie didn't get made. When you get a reboot you're thinking it'll be the best thing since the last one but there's a 95% chance you'll be heavily disappointed because all reboots really are, are cash grabs. And Warner Bros are definitely known for those!\n\nThe first act of this film is meta, really really meta. It's so meta that they may as well have been winking at the camera, but winking with both eyes at the same time because of how poorly done it was. It reminded me of what Space Jam: New Legacy was, just one big promo for Warner Bros. As soon as they said \"our partner, Warner Bros want a sequel\" I just wanted to die.\n\nAt first, I thought it was an interesting way to imprison Neo, by making him think he was the video game designer of The Matrix and everything that happened in the first three movies was all in his head. However the writing and the scenes were dumb, I had to cover my eyes. It felt like everything the first three movies did was for nothing.\n\nThen eventually it started to feel like a Matrix sequel in the second act, once Neo got brought back. It was cool that Keanu shaved his head for it, it really felt like Neo was truly back. However, when we met the secondary characters. I really didn't like most of them. They always feel like they have to add a cast of young secondary characters to make the movie seem more 'with the times'? I've never thought Jessica Henwick was a good actress, she didn't feel like a Matrix character. I'm sure those who have seen Sense8 noticed a few familiar faces though. Casting Jonathan Groff and Neil Patrick Harris were weird ones, because their faces aren't ominous in the slightest to be the villains, they just looked like regular dudes, repeating lines from the old movies, trying to be modern versions of The Architect and Agent Smith.\n\nWhat was funny about them constantly playing scenes from the old movies was that it reminded us how much better they were compared to what we were currently watching.\n\nWhat this movie lacked was the sophistication that the first few movies had. Instead of Neo and Trinity looking like bad asses, it was just messy action sequences with force pushes? Granted, Keanu Reeves seemed like one of the few people there actually putting some effort in, because alongside him was Carrie Anne-Moss, who didn't seem like she wanted to be there.\n\nThat brings me to the directing. I personally think the Wachowskis got super freaking lucky with the first Matrix being one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made. Some of the shots in this movie looked like shots you'd see in a behind-the-scenes featurette. The sets looked like movie sets and kind of low budget. It was all so poorly done that it kept taking me out of the experience.\n\nThis movie only felt like a Matrix movie when they were in the real world, but even then, the lack of that grittiness and the green-y filter made it feel like it was lacking The Matrix feel.\n\nI'll admit, the new human settlement looked great! That was all until Jada Pinkett-Smith entered the frame and we saw her terrible performance and the terrible old-person makeup done on her. It was painful to look at. Then on to explaining how Morpheus was there but also not there, really confused the hell out of me. It's like they didn't even know themselves why Lawrence Fishburne wasn't there, they just wanted to be able to have a character called Morpheus in the movie, but just played by someone else?\n\nSome visual and audio editing was also really shoddy. You could tell this was a rushed job that Warner Bros just wanted to get made. It was obvious to see all the red flags in the promo for this film, it didn't feel like the real deal. The Wachowskis haven't made a decent movie for a long time, why would one of them suddenly conjure up the skill to finally make a good movie? They should've just given the movie to someone else to make. But who knows, maybe this movie was doomed to fail either way, because you can tell that Warner Bros had some \"creative input\". And if different director were to failed, then the fans would complain and say the Wachowskis should've made it. After all, they created The Matrix world, but like George Lucas did with Star Wars, they ran a great thing into the ground by trying to build on it (but yes, Revenge of the Sith was incredible).",

E a resposta \u00e9 que n\u00e3o! #Ressurections n\u00e3o tenta ser uma continua\u00e7\u00e3o ou um fechamento e sim um grande e c\u00f4mico exerc\u00edcio de metalinguagem, que serve apenas pra atualizar as analogias de Matrix com a sociedade de 2021.\n\nO filme n\u00e3o vai tentar te explicar o que \u00e9 a Matrix, mas ele vai tentar te cativar pela nostalgia. O filme \u00e9 completamente dependente daquilo que veio antes, fazendo incessantes paralelos entre o que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 vendo e o que voc\u00ea j\u00e1 viu, e isso porque o pr\u00f3prio roteiro n\u00e3o \u00e9 profundo o bastante pra prender a sua aten\u00e7\u00e3o.

O filme n\u00e3o tenta mascarar isso em momento nenhum... na verdade, adota pra sua narrativa num dos poucos pontos positivos.\n\nCom esse filme, Matrix deixa de ser uma critica a sociedade, e passa a ser uma critica ao modo hollywoodiano de se viver e de se correr com a vida, utilizando de um humor \u00e1cido e escrachado pra isso. E sobre a nova roupagem de velhos personagens... A resposta \u00e9 que eles nem de perto fazem jus ao que eram, mas talvez brilhem do seu pr\u00f3prio jeito, com exce\u00e7\u00e3o de Trinity que finalmente ganha o espa\u00e7o e o poder que sempre mereceu, quando voc\u00ea percebe que o filme de fato, foi feio para ela.",

            "content": "Here I am, to talk about a resounding flop, in all respects, and I'm not kidding. \nMatrix Resurrection is the fourth chapter in the Matrix franchise, it is pathetic and not epic, not like those of the original trilogy, which are fantastic and wonderful, while this film is very ugly \nBy the direction of only Lana from The Wachowski, thinking about it, it was as if the director knew that this film was useless, but she did not want to finish a story that is like a perfect cycle. \nIt's very sad how the audience associates the name \"Wachowski\" only with Matrix, every time the sisters want to do a new film, it reveals as a flop because \"Wachowski\" is only Matrix. \n\nIt is like a fanfiction, everything is explained, how but don't why, there isn't space for the interpretation or for the philosophical concepts. When you go to the cinema and you know you're going to watch Matrix, you expect, from this film, to deal with important themes with deep and complicated philosophical meanings, you certainly don't expect to watch a film that seems to be written on Wattpad.\nFor instance, it is like a Disney film, yeah for kids, as if the director took the old trilogy, mixed it with a children's film and here we are, Matrix Resurrections. In addition, all the irony moments seems like for the children, but, obvious, the children don't watch this film because the Matrix Franchise (I mean only the old ones) isn't for kids. \nIn support of this, some dialogues are put into the mouths of adults who would never use that kind of expression, that kind of slang, only for pleasing the public, \nThis film's very didactic and simple, it shows everything to the viewer who already knows what he is going to watch. The film is mediocre, only for give the audience what it want and not for be original and surprise it, in substance, the film is a modern version that fits in with today's standards like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, in summary, a fanservice. \n\nChanging argument, there isn't significance over the characters, there isn't interests over what they do, in particular the new ones. \nThe characters have aged and when they move to fight, they are floppy and not as agile as they used to be, you look at them and think: what are they doing there? \nBut in the end, it's not their fault, it's just life cycle.\nThe characters from this film are like a parody of themselves, and talking about parodies, the parody of excellence, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's Morpheus. \nWhat is he doing there? Why did they do that? \nBecause in the end there was no need for this character, just with his presence he ruins the existence of the original Morpheus, the god of dreams, I feel bad just thinking about it. But for heaven's sake the actor is good, but I just don't understand the need for a new Morpheus who moreover keeps saying he's a sort of copy of the original, who just tries to imitate him as best as possible, like I said, it's a parody. \nBut we want to talk about Neo, alias of Thomas Anderson? \nKeanu Reeves is a fantastic actor and there is no need that I say that, but in this film, he is floppy and transmits depression, you just have to look at he to feel sad. In addiction his presence isn't justified, or better, they explain \"how\" but not \"why\" he is what he's. \nSomewhat like the presence of Trinity, interpreted, as always, by Carrie-Anne Moss. \nOne of the biggest problems of this film is the fact that they use the concept of girl power too much, let me explain, they give Trinity play the role of the woman in love who defeats everything, there was no need for that, Trinity doesn't need \" the girl power\" because she's been like that since the beginning, even before they invented it. She's been a very strong woman who, let's say, didn't meet the standards of the time, she had, and still has, short hair with lots of gel, leather suits, motorbikes, and guns. \nIt is a nonsensical concept for Trinity because her DNA has always been that of a warrior woman and not that of a damsel to be rescued who surprises everyone with a bit of luck. \nLet's talk about the enemies of Neo, the Agent Smith, in the original trilogy he had a very important role for the film, he was a character well done. There isn't a logical reason for his existence, he doesn't have sense and is practically useless, in fact, without him the story would have been the same, but this reflection, it wouldn't apply to the first three films, because as already mentioned, Agent Smith plays a really important role, particularly in the second and third film. \n\nThe plot is practically copied, full of reshooting, for example; the white rabbit that reminds \"Alice in Wonderland\", the black cat, the red and blue pill, and EVEN the bullet time. All the things I've just enumerated, they take away all the mysteries and questions that were in the first films. \nAs I said before, the plot is practically the same at the first film (the one from 1999), it's like when you give a classmate something to copy at school and he changes something to avoid making it too obvious, in short, the key word is \"parallelism\". \nThe moments that should be funny interrupt the audience's immersion in the important moments and they detach it from the film, by consolidating the fourth wall and not trying to demolish it. In general, the audience wants to immerse themselves in the film, feel a multitude of emotions and have new experiences. In this, the audience knows they are watching it from a screen and not as part of it, they are not taken in. As if that were not enough, there're a lot of combatants that don't have an impact in the story, they don't have a sense and add nothing to the film, unlike those in the first three films, because there is always justified, and let me say it, all the choreography and pits are terrible. \nMoreover, this film is too much nostalgic over the others before, there are a lot of flashback and references really useless, precisely for remind you it is a reboot. \nChanging subject and going more technical, aesthetics, photography and cinematography, original are ruined. Before there was this strong green filter that made almost all the colors inside the Matrix, green or black, moreover, you could understand if the characters are inside the Matrix or not, thanks to the colors, in fact when they were in the real world the dominating colors were blue and grey, colors often associated with technology and the future, while inside the Matrix, precisely, this scale of green and black gave a feeling of unreality and unease. \nIn the fourth film this important play of colors is lost, and the latter tend to be those of a blockbuster, moreover, it is no longer clear when the characters are actually inside the Matrix. \nAdditionally, the bullet time. When the people think at Matrix, they think at Neo dodging bullets while is bent over in an unnatural position, the bullet time is nearly a trademark of Matrix, also this thing is lost in the fourth chapiter. The effects in general aren't very beautiful, with the modern conception of the world we have today, it is unthinkable that a film of 99 has more beautiful effects than one of 2021, that is, 22 years have passed, the situation should be improved, with this I say that if we compare the different films, the CGI in the former is much higher than that of this hideous film. \n\nSummarized, Matrix Resurrections doesn't have a reason to exist because it has a narrative power inexistent, it doesn't add anything and is useless. This movie is a horrible version of the original trilogy, a forgone movie, only with its presence, it ruins the first three movie. \nThe only reason to watch it, is for making your opinion about it. \n\nThanks for reading until this point :)",

While the movie heavily borrows upon the first 3 films it does so for the sake of continuity and there is nothing quite as new in the action sequences as well but what does separate this film from the rest is the story and the bold new direction it takes. Now which of these bot reviewers here mention bad script writing? It's actually quite good and has some complex sub plots brought in for good measure and I am an IT engineer and I definitely understood the techie bits pretty well and it is actually a fact that the 'Analyst' controls pretty much the direction a project is going and in this case the project is 'The Matrix'. Ignore the haters and watch this film, but remember this film does not try to outdo the franchise but it does give a better conclusion to the shocker ending of the trilogy. Highly recommended.",

The older physical features are welcomed as they feel natural because they are. No presence of de-aging CGI as far as I could tell.\n\nWhile the first three Matrix films are visually defined by the classic green on black iconography and dark hues to portray a conflict against oppressive machines, Matrix Resurrections is a visual masterpiece that deserves a theatrical viewing by fans.

The actors are not young and agile like they used to be,  so most of the scenes were pretty stiff. (i love Keanu.. but) Keanu and his bullet blocking, throughout the entire movie, was the same God dam stance and pose every single time.. \nAside from the poor acting,  the story also sucked. It was drawn out for what it was,  this 2.5hr long movie could have been 45 minutes long and I would have been all the happier for it. Not to mention, Trinnity's punch line when Keanu fails to fly. It absolutely killed me, not in a good way, but in the way of finally putting a knife through the heart of this wretched attempt at rebooting the franchise. Followed by a maddening transition to everything suddenly being OK.\nI think they leaned a little too hard on the whole \"it's the Matrix, it'll make money\" bit.\nFor clarification, IN THE MOVIE,  they talk about why people make reboots, and I'm pretty sure it's Keanu that response \"because reboots make money\".. \nThis movie was an entire joke.\nThanks, I hope you read this before you wasted 2.5hrs if your life.

Besides that instance where The Matrix Resurrections (2021) feels like a copy of the original, this film is extremely ambitious with how experimental and self aware it is. After the initial trilogy ended in a natural way, this film had to do something different to justify a fourth film, and while it does, it doesn't entirely work, instead making this film a convoluted mess, relying too much on forced fan service.\n\nThe action and effects are good, with some creative visual shots, but overall it doesn't make up for many issues this film does have. The recast of Morpheus and Agent Smith was a bold decision and while it attempts to be justified it just doesn't work, despite their best attempts Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Jonathan Groff just don't match up to Laurence Fishburn and Hugo Weaving.\n\nWhile it will earn respect for trying some things new, The Matrix Resurrections (2021) proves that not every franchise revival works.",

Neo already knows what he has to do, but what he doesn't yet know is that the Matrix is stronger, more secure and far more dangerous than ever before. Visual effects are incredible and innovative in this new sequel released almost 19 years after the trilogy ended. The plot is incredibly meta and yet so down-to-earth that the script is worthy of mention for that. I like how it ended but I believe it should be left as a stand-alone movie. But it was really entertaining overall. Finally, the Sense 8 cast is back! \ud83d\ude03",

These were nearly present and referenced in nearly every single scene, which was just simply distracting and again, unnecessary.

The decision to recast iconic characters like Agent Smith and Morpheus was a boned-headed decision. In that case, they should have just had a whole new cast including Neo and Trinity, making them reincarnations or something stupid like that.\n\nVisually, it was okay, but the action scenes were shot in such a way with lighting that it was hard to even see anything. Neo only really used a fraction of his power, and they really relied on his ability to stop bullets way too much. It was sad how they used how he can't fly anymore as a joke.... ugh. Oh, but now Trinity can fly, so is she the One now? Also, the post credit scene just made me say \"What? Why? Catrix? The fuck?\" But it did say something interesting, indeed, movies are dead it seems, and this dumpster fire of a sequel, with all the inside jokes and self-deprecating humor about the movie itself is probably helping kill movies even faster.",

Lots of males will hate that. \nMatrix 4 was a thankless task from the beginning, as Lana W. has said and has Thomas Anderson say in the film. \nTwo other films may help the confused relate to this Matrix reboot better.  One is Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation (2002) where breaking the fourth wall between fiction and the viewer's expectations is much of the foreground of the narrative, spectacularly in the third act.  The other is Johnathan Mostow's Terminator 3 (2003) where another director publicly lamented his task: following up and improving on Terminator 2.  \nIn this context of movies about making movies, I liked Matrix 4 better than I thought I would.  I appreciated Reeves' understated presence.  I liked teh moments of clarity and insight framing the issue of sheeple-followers vs. independent and critical thinking (waking up).  What might have improved this and made it more coherent is more awareness of and attention to two memes:  Healthy democratic socialism as alternative to corporate consumerism neo-feudalism; and, Cultural Creative/Divine Feminine rhetoric. Both these themes haunt the fringes of the film as these really are the likely ways forward culturally and for which new leaders are needed.",

            "content": "Before watching The Matrix Resurrections, my brother compared it with Toy Story 4, a movie that, in my humble opinion, shouldn't exist, because Toy Story 3 is possibly the most perfect ending of a franchise in movies history, the epilogue closes perfectly Woody's and Andy's cycles. Even before its birth, Toy Story 4 looked bitter. The Matrix Revolutions, though, has an ending that allows a future visit to the Matrix universe. And was this new visit satisfying? Well, more or less. It has good ideas and it's easy to immerse yourself in the film because few universes are more sympathetic than the Matrix. Keanu Reeves has his usual charisma, but this time, visually, Neo bothered me a little bit. It was inevitable to compare him with John Wick. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Morpheus is a more serious mistake. Okay, Laurence Fishburne didn't accept to repeat his role and I understand the idea of a younger Morpheus, but the character lost his essence, he was never a comic presence. Watching him, I remembered Nick Fury from Captain Marvel. Carrie-Anne Moss works, her relationship with Neo is important to the plot, but her chemistry with Keanu Reeves seems to no longer exist. Jonathan Groff has nowhere near Hugo Weaving's charm as Agent Smith, this iconic character became generic. And not only did Agent Smith become generic, but also the action sequences. The \"bullet time\" from the 1999 film is better than anything from the 2021 film. Oh, and Neil Patrick Harris has a good role on paper, but he is a pain in the ass, it was hard to abide him because he talks a lot more than he should. The first act is terrible. The universe is good, but the presentation isn't. Besides being hypocritical in a moment where it criticizes its own existence (something Space Jam 2, also from Warner, also did), the movie evokes the other film of the franchise at the same time it looks to rag them. After this long negative text, please don't understand me wrong, this film is a lot better than The Matrix Revolutions. The pace is good, the film, again, has good ideas, is enjoyable and never gets boring. I just missed what made The Matrix be The Matrix. It's a derivative action film, which within that franchise, is frustrating.",

It deserved results at the box office but it's understandable that people are wary of soft reboots (Terminator Dark Fate was so bad and Star Wars 7 led to the disastrous Last Jedi).\n\nResurrections has heart and tries to answer questions about its universe. Like what happened after the events of Revolutions. Why the anomaly is useful to the Matrix. Why the peace Neo brought was important (it didn't seem to be in 2003's Revolutions to me).\n\nThe first half is the best as it focuses in on Thomas's life as it is without being Neo. A life more ordinary. This theme, something #GenX can relate to, makes this movie work. Is Thomas being who he was meant to be? I kept thinking of Hot Tub Time Machine (the regret of middle age). And Unbreakable (Bruce Willis's characters \"sadness in the mornings\" while living a life of compromise. \n\nBy the time the movie focuses on Trinity, this theme is glaring. You can relate when she's trying to live her life by asking Neo questions about the Matrix, and her family pulls her away. That's what families do. They often pull you away from your life's work. That's okay because relationships should come first, but you can see why the Catholic Church forbade Priests from marrying. \n\nI found the ending to be rushed and cartoonish. That doesn't bode well if this franchise is going to continue. But there is mention of \"The Suits\".. \nHowever, I give this movie two thumbs up as it stayed with me in my mind the next day, and I want to add it to my BlueRay collection.",

Seems box office, as expected, it's ok - Currently 50 million under production budget). The thing that really ruffles my feathers is that, as the previous comment, this iteration mostly feels like Wachowski's having a decline in career after spectacular failures (Jupiter Ascending, Cloud Atlas, or being particularly bitter about having Sense8 booted from Netflix seemingly), and accepting to come back to this franchise for the cash grab - Then totally filling the movie with criticism about people returning to movies for a cash grab. \n\nThere'd be *some* sense of profound criticism with good reason (If you followed the whole Netflix versus Wachowski debacle, where they literally started blowing 1 million an episode for Sense8 as a budget on Netflix' dime, flying all over Europe for 5 minutes of shooting a scene and 5 days of drug-induced partying), except for the fact that if you click on the actor list in this 4th Matrix, they *still* recycled all actors from their previous work, like Sense8. I think I see like half the cast of Sense8 in this movie, except for those that spoke out against the Wachowskis, which seem to be blacklisted for life. After blowing up bridges with Netflix (Ending Sense8 with the close-up of a dripping strap-on against their wishes + taking the finale for showing at events without Netflix greenlighting it) and now so blatantly shouting against their parent company in here, it'd be interesting to see who still wants to touch any of the Wachowskis with a ten foot pole :)",

            "content": "This movie is so questionable that almost the entirety of the two and a half hour runtime is spent trying to justify its own existence. It's one of those movies in a franchise that is so bad that it makes you reconsider your entire liking for the other films in the series as well as the talent of the director, Lana Wachowski (half of the Wachowski siblings of original Matrix trilogy fame). *Spoilers ahead* What's so dissapointing about this film is that as imaginitive as the attempts are at explaining the resurrections of both Neo, Trinity, and the Matrix as a whole, it all feels uneccessary. The movie is like a bird who flew into an open cage and the entire time is crying about its imprisonment while the latch is open, no one forced anyone to make this film, so why is it trying to arduously to exist. The meta commentary criticizing the original trilogy while also making the movie seem like more of a direct  critique of social media and the trappings of modern life rings hollow considering this movie is a very part of that machine. It's a movie trapped in the difficult position of reviving a series after so much time that it has to give the audience some excuse to chew on why it should exist at all, but in taking that task on it undoes itself, spending the majority of the time so focused on the question it's almost impossible to not think about it. This is the first sin of many, as the movie also constnatly reuses footage from the trilogy, especially the first Matrix, reminding us why we loved the series in the first place while essentially redoing these scenes only worse. The warddrobe is ludicrous in some futile attempt to modernize the steam-punk/leather/anime fashion of the first films, while Neo is donning a casual sports jacket and jeans look almost the entire film, looking less badass and more ready for a business casual dinner (in some of the movie this outfit makes sense, in his return to the proverbial \"matrix\" after being \"awoken\" again it just seems like Neo has given up on the aesthetic of the original films all together. The action might be some of the worst I've seen in recent years, with the original trilogy not only outdoing every action scene here, but also giving each punch, kick, gunshot much more immediacy and higher stakes, while every CGI aided moment of violence here feels lackluster and lacking. In general the movie virtually has no stakes, and feels shackled to the worst elements of the past films without knowing how to appreciate what made them (at leas the first one) truly special. Neo and Trinity might be the only good thing in this movie, as Reeves and Moss still seem to have great chemistry on screen. However other then them the new agent Smith, Morpheus, Neil Patrick Harris' character, and so on are subpar at best, not because they can't act but mostly because the films script is so focused on the mental gymnastics of why, and less on the characters themselves. There's so much to deride, but really you just come away from it feeling sad, old, and rethinking why you ever liked any Matrix film in the first place. Maybe the best aspect of this movie is that it's so trifling that it gives you hope that if someone could make a film as horrendous as this 18 years after the original trilogy ended, maybe we still have time to make better on our lives. Whatever the end result will be, it can't be worse then this.",

The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this\".

The saga was more or less usable and enjoyable on condition of forgetting one of the worst screenplay inconsistencies in the history of cinema or, vice versa, of interpretating it as the demonstration of the truthfulness of the basic assumption. \"Matrix 4\" is a bogus product, added almost twenty years later without any valid artistic reason: metatextuality avoids the fundamental dilemma, the disquisition on free will is already stale in itself and in any case Lana has the modesty not to take it seriously, the love story between Neo and Trinity had already touched quite another emotional peaks in the mutual resurrection of the first 2 episodes, the criticism of the geek generation who wanted to change the world and instead became its new ruler (and slave) is euphemistically weak, the rejection of a binary logic (\"two-valued\", Boolean algebra, the Parmenidean and Aristotelian \"aut aut: tertium non datur\") reiterates the allusion to gender fluidity in cast, actor roles and audience.

            "content": "This might've been a better viewing experience had it actually been 18 years since I last watched a Matrix movie. Seeing it a few days after rewatching the originals unfortunately prevented nostalgia from clouding my judgment. Instead this felt like a completely unnecessary re-tread that, instead of building on the events of the last movie, traced back over the steps of the first where Neo starts out as a nobody again. It would've been cool to see them kind of hit fast-forward on the process & only build on the original trilogy with the third act, but they actually didn't do that & instead just sort of stretched this movie's runtime to cover some of the events of Reloaded instead. Perhaps retrospectively this will be fine if they build on with more installments, but in the first act they had a character say he always doubted Neo was ever really The One; from that moment on it was clear they we were just so hungry for a 4th Matrix that we'd swallow whatever garbage they came up with. The fact that I can't sit here for a moment and think of a different way to do a 4th movie than what they did here is solely evidence that they shouldn't have made this one and isn't at all evidence that they made a good decision here. The worst part was the incredibly low stakes they provided where the entire point of every scene was reuniting Neo with Trinity and nothing else. Their relationship is one of the least-compelling that I've ever seen in any movie, let alone a whole quadrilogy like this. It was the worst aspect of the latter movies of the original trilogy and is enough to ruin this one completely for me. I also disliked the unnecessary recasting they did, but I will say that Keanu is a much better actor when he hides his wooden face with the beard!",

And though Resurrections acts as a step up from the previous two instalments (the somewhat underrated The Matrix Reloaded and the disappointing The Matrix Revolutions), its still not entirely on the level of the original. But oh does it aim high! A wonderfully meta film which reboots the franchise in an interesting way, we find out that Neo and Trinity have been brought back from the dead and reentered into the Matrix. When Neo begins to have visions of his past, the powers that be in the \"real\" world work their hardest to push down his awakening. In the process, a new group of awakened soldiers try to get the rebooted Neo to join the new fight against the machines! A superbly thought out film is a little bit let down by some decisions here and there, this sequel is definitely fun and quite the mind tingler as well! The one thing I enjoy the most about this franchise is that its cerebral. Along with the great action comes some well thought out meta philosophical/religious allegories that make the action more meaningful. The movie acts as a commentary on the state of modern day summer blockbusters as well! Its fun to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss back in their iconic roles! They carry the movie above with their wonderful chemistry and feel for the action. The disappointing factor is the recasting of Morpheus and Agent Smith. Both Yahya Abdul Mateenii and Jonathan Groff are fine in their performances, but its a little bit of a bummer to not have Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving back! Other than that, the rest of the cast is fine! Its also cool how the movie reuses footage from the original trilogy often throughout the film! Its a nice way to help remind the audience and add a sense of \"deja-vu\" for Neo during the process of reacquainting with the Matrix. Making the story be based around game development was also a nice touch! It does get a little messy in thought near the third quarter, but other than that, the movie is a solid return for a great franchise!",

Reminds me of the Disney Star Wars films - all the glitz and painfully self-conscious virtue signalling, none of the thoughtful philosophy, sci-fi, or world crafting. If this was the Wachowski's attempt to give a middle finger to Warner Bros for forcing their hand with the threat of making the movie without them, then mission accomplished. However it also ends up being a perhaps unintentional middle finger to the audience that wanted to see another glimpse into the world the first Matrix film revealed, which none since has successfully revisited. In a time where virtual reality, AI, and robotics are taking baby steps, and millions fear for automation of their jobs while truth and reality are bent like play things for the rich and powerful, this seems like a missed opportunity to seize the zeitgeist and deliver something meaningful about the world we are building. A matrix prequel, taking place during the Second Renaissance where machine served man until they revolted, or even earlier when man was first freed from nearly all labor by machines, would have been far more prescient and sincere.",

Alas.\n\nThe premise posed more questions than it answered and the plot doesn't make too much sense, even in the world of the Matrix (or the Matrix in the Matrix).  I left the cinema feeling like it was a shame they did this and that it didn't REALLY need to be made, for all the things it \"added\" to the story.\n\nThe newer elements like \"transmorphic\" programmes were a bit too far for me. As for the \"cuddly sentinels\" they were a bit corny and more \"Free Willy\" than the hi-tech AI entities they're supposed to be - you get the impression this will be a line of toys. \n\nThe movie missed several opportunities; to explore the layers of the matrix and its origins  a bit more; explain the fate of the architect properly; a credible story for Iio (Zion's replacement); why Neo hadn't aged (that much) in 60 years; why there was a 60 year gap in the first place; How Agent Smith got reincarnated and why he was placed next to Neo to not do anything to him given his hatred for him.\n\nThis is a really good move, just not a great Matrix movie, although it isn't as bad as Matrix Revolutions, so I guess there's that.",

The visual effects look good and so does the cinematography but it's missing that iconic green tint. This is obviously a minor issue but it impacts the film a lot. The green tint is iconic to the trilogy and it not being here makes the film feel like it's lacking something. A lot of this film feels like it's lacking. The story is really weak and contrived and it's meta commentary is awful. It's possible to do meta commentary on your own films/genre right, look to the Scream films for that, but it's awful here. They make fun of the tropes but then do the exact same thing without a hint of irony. It feels like they forgot there was meta commentary to this film. It's my biggest issue with this film and it really drags it down. Some of the action doesn't necessarily suck but it isn't great either. It's hard to tell what is going on and it's filmed in such a bland way. The performances are fine. Keanu Reeves is being Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss is fine. Neil Patrick Harris and Jonathan Groff are standouts but I take issue with their characters. Groff plays Hugo Weaving's role from the original films but he just kinda starts being Agent Smith. There isn't any build up prior and he just becomes him. The issue I have with Neil Patrick Harris's character is due to his presentation on screen. They lower the frame rate whenever he is on screen and it looks awful. They lower the frame rate a lot in this movie and it never looks good. This film really didn't need to have been made but at least it has some sort of message which is more than I can say for Revolutions.

I also absolutely love Neil Patrick Harris as one of the new villains, because he's such a fine actor.  Although I'm glad that they still got the original actors like Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, I honestly felt sad that Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving didn't reprise their roles. It was fine to see a new actor as Morpheus, but it felt really odd to see Agent Smith being played by another actor. The movie still has excellent visual effects. The action somewhat lacks the usual kung fu style fights from the previous movies. And the use of \"bullet time\", which made the previous movies such hits, are too few in this new one. The movie also lacks the wit, charm and originality of the first Matrix movie. Also, some of the flashbacks were too repetitive and unnecessary.

In a few words, the film presents us with the same plot of Matrix 1, only after 60 years. \nThe film presents scenes such as the reconstruction of Morpheus from Neo's memories of the events that occurred in the Matrix 1, 2, and 3 movies, which are stored inside a video game which he himself programs while living in the original Matrix. To do this, a girl from the real world named Bugs enters the video game created by Neo (forgive the redundancy) to unplug digital Morpheus from that software, from there send him to the Matrix, and from there release him into the real world through a humanoid body made of metal balls, pesto that does not possess a human body like the original Morpheus. This is an example of the kind of scenes that make the film difficult to understand and that do not add anything relevant to the story. \nIn the film we also see absurd scenes such as the resurrection of Trinity, which was already practically dead in Matrix 3, but in this one we are told that her body was recovered by the machines, rebuilt and miraculously returned to life to be re-entered to the Matrix with Neo, a situation that makes no sense since they are a great danger to the existence of the Matrix and the machines. The most logical thing is that they would have left Trinity and Neo to die to eliminate their remaining enemies. \nAs a fan of the original trilogy, I expected the directors to philosophically innovate the story in this film, since the most modern physics theories explore time travel, multiverses, extra dimensions, and multilayers of computer simulated reality, I think that only it was enough for them to look at those theories and add some of that to the movie to make it more interesting. But no, they stayed exploring the same two layers of reality, that is, the Matrix and the real world. As a curious fact, in Matrix 3 Neo has super powers in reality and can see the world as made of light, that would explain why the Matrix would be multilayered, and even the video game created by Neo could be considered one more layer of the Matrix, at least the directors would have explored these multilayers in depth to cause an impact on the viewer, but they just did more of the same.",

There are few directors who bring innovative films into the room (Nolan, Tarantino ...) The director of the Matrix in the first part of the film wants to underline these elements by re-proposing a plot already seen less compelling.  The first act is the one I appreciated the most.  the problem is the last act, in which a series of very badly managed fights take place.  This film is not groundbreaking from a plot point of view, but it stands out as a critic from the director.  The scene after the credits confirms this fact.",

Films like Blade Runner, Dune and Matrix Ressurrections should fall in this category.\n\nTo start Matrix Ressurrections has over 25 explosions, some completely unnecessary. Second, instead of the greenish look of the original, this one sometimes  has the look of a reality show.  When it comes to set design its a pastiche of every sci fi film from the last 35 years...when you think nothing can get worse, they bring in Neil Patrick Harris, who gives you the same cartoonish performance he does in every single movie. But wait, Neil Patrick Harris gives a monologue of several minutes, to try to explain what the plot was up to that moment.\nIn a way its a good thing because up til now, I had no idea of what was happening.\nThen, there's the issue of the endless fights that seems to happen every five minutes. And the bullets that stop in the air. And then the filmmakers lower the bar one more notch by showing the POV of the floor. Yes, in this movie, the floor, the same floor that everybody walks on it, well, the floor has its own POV when it sees bullets casings falling into it.\nAnd the movie is a collection of POVs, close up of things, to make a long story short, shots that make no sense. They are in the movie just because, someone thought it was cool.\n\nInstead of a convincing and mysterious Agent Smith, now they give you a good looking model, that could not be more out of place.\n\nIf there's one good thing in this movie, is that they employed several homeless costume designers, to give a homeless look to the movie. Which is probably good.\nGood to know that in the future, generals and other important people, will look, dress, flap their arms and take like homeless people.",

Like \"look, we know that this is what this looks like, but we're aware of that so trust us, it's actually much DEEPER.\" But it's not, it's just a lame retelling of a much better older movie. By pointing out its own shallowness, the film thinks it can rise above what it is, but it ends up just drawing attention to that fact even more. There's also a ton of awkward dialogue and random clips referencing the original film, just constantly reminding you that you're watching an inferior version. The movie feels like a clip show for the original trilogy more than an actual film itself at times. On top of that the action is weak (possibly this film's greatest sin), even going so far as to make inferior, far more choppily-edited recreations of much better, more iconic action scenes from the original. And finally, the weird replacements for original characters (I won't spoil who) do not remotely justify why they have taken over from the iconic original actors. This film is like The Force Awakens, but without even the fun action scenes, brisk pacing, or likable new characters to keep it entertaining.

My first complaint is Neil Patrick Harris, he is honestly a useless character, and I hate how he was the surprise villain. My last complaint is the casting for Morpheus and Agent Smith. I like the energy that Jonathan Groff adds to Agent Smith, but he is not as intimidating as Hugo Weaving. Morpheus was a very cool character from the OG trilogy because Lawrence Fishburne did his best.

            "content": "There is a lot to say about 'The Matrix Resurrections'. First off, it was fine. Not exactly what I'd wished it to be. It could have been more or less but then again; we didn't ask for this to be made. Thankfully, I enjoyed this a bit more than I expected with all the mixed reviews and it offers a fairly natural progression of the story after the extravagant but hollow conclusion of the original trilogy, \"Revolutions\". In despite of that, this falls into the problems of the sequels with their storytelling: being dense and clunky stuffed with intriguing ideas but struggling to give us an array of characters and scenarios to care about. With this surprising installment, it suffers from missing elements and a strange lack in execution with what made the Matrix so special. Here are a few of the things that are sorely missing from this entry: Joel Silver, Lilly Wachowski, Bill Pope & Yuen Woo-ping. I can't say I know everything there is about a movie producers' job other than financing movie projects and making sure every facet of the productions run smoothly. Joel Silver was an exec on the original trilogy and his legendary filmography speaks for itself. He evidently didn't return to produce \"Resurrections\", and it makes me wonder how differently the story would have turned out under his watch. I'm glad that Lana Wachowski came back to make another Matrix movie, whether her vision had been marinating all these years or her hand was forced to dish out another \"Matrix\" film by the studio. But the one big thing that the marketing champaign keep in secrecy (only hinting at it a week before release) is just how full-blown meta the story was going to be. \n\n\nIt is quite a creative \"choice\" to acknowledge storylines, characters, plot points, quoted lines, and even recreating many shots from the original trilogy the way that they do in this sequel, and it is a major point of contention for most of the fans; Lingering so heavily on the familiar instead of moving forward brazenly into the unknown, all while answering all the questions as to how/why Neo & Trinity are back and how the worlds of machines & men have changed since their harrowing events of \"Revolutions\". Most of the questions are answered, though with plodding exposition and awkward \"lightness\" which often kills much of the momentum and stakes of the narrative. There is a disjointed struggle with making either the meta-commentary of today's media consumed society, a snarky slap at the business of Hollywood blockbusters or a potentially compelling story arc of Neo rediscovering himself stick its landing. There are a lot of cool ideas that this film touches on (including a civil war among the Machines and evolution of the human's relation with Sentients). Unfortunately, the movie leans more into the standard fare of the previous films than truly embracing these ideas for its own benefit. Above anything else, I find the love story of Neo & Trinity perhaps the most satisfying storyline here and their scenes together are fun to watch, I can't say I am a fan of these \"discount\" variants of Morpheus and Agent Smith. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is fine but, even though he doesn't have to imitate Laurence Fishburne's iconic role, his lack of charisma by comparison is unmistakable. Jonathan Groff arguably makes his part a bit his own as \"Smith\" but how he utilized into the narrative is wonky at best and doesn't add much menace like Hugo Weaving did in his own sleep! Some of the other new additions of the cast fare better. Jessica Henwick gets a lot of screentime as Bugs, and she carries it well. Although I can't quite get past his \"How I Met Your Mother\" image, Neil Patrick Harris is having some fun as \"The Analyst\". \n\n\nOddly enough, the weakest aspect of the movie is the action. The set-pieces are fine at best but hardly memorable and not nearly as stylized as it was with the original trilogy. This is flat-out disappointing given how one of the biggest achievements of the original and parts of the sequels is the amazing action; the other being the Visual effects, which are most reliable part of 'Resurrections\" but even some of the effects get a bit dodgy.  With Lana directing all the action scenes herself (no second-unit director, mind you) and the absence of her sister Lilly Wachowski as co-director, it makes me believe the Lana probably had the handle on story/character while Lilly may have helped refine the staging of the set-pieces with the originals. But what's more of a detriment to this movie is that the absence of the cinematographer and stunt choreographer of the original trilogy: Bill Pope & Yuen Woo-ping. Pope captured the fights and chase sequences pf the original trilogy with such fluidity and robust shot composition that gave the visuals a graphic novel flair. Woo-ping's kung fu choreography was fast & furious, landing every punch or kick with endless style or heft. In 'Resurrection\", the action consist mostly of shootouts, a couple chases and a lack of kung-fu, all plainly framed and hectically edited, almost resorting to \"shaky-cam\" in some instances. When I was moderately gripped with the story on my first viewing, the action sequences actually took me out of the experience! Not to put any blame on Oscar-winning DP John Toll, who was credited as cinematographer for much of the filming but left the project for personal reasons and Wachowski's long-time camera operator, Daniele Massacessi, took over. This is the first Matrix movie shot entirely digital; the Matrix itself sans the off-set green tint for a crystal-clear image that makes it looks more sterile than gritty, which is fitting for the version of the program in the context of this story but takes away the grit away from the action scenes. I have mixed feelings about how they expand on the concept of \"Bullet-Time here but the sequence in question is more visually creative than all the generic shoot-outs and sloppy fisticuffs. The finale fares a bit better but nothing like as jaw-dropping as the third act of the first film was.\n\n\nThen, the movie ends pretty abruptly; giving that feeling like this is the film you just watch so you can watch the next and hopefully better movie. Some have compared this movie to \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" and that can understandable because of how wildly divisive \"Resurrections\" turned out to be critically and both movies deconstruct their respective franchises. But unlike \"The Last Jedi\", where its subversive turns, strong character arcs and emotional heft made me feel utterly enthralled and inspired in that beloved cinematic realm, \"Resurrections\" ended up in the opposite direction and evocated an indifferent response. Ultimately, this latest plugin doesn't quite capture the impact or ingenuity of the original. Despite its many flaws, I sort of see this as a expanded epilogue or coda that manages to give a more serviceable end to a once ground-breaking, now tiresome film series than the sour anti-climax of \"Revolutions\" - 6/10 (C+)",

WIthout giving anything away, I can say strongly, that the first hour was not only a bore - it was angering. It is TALKING, and on the level of 13 year old philosophy. My gawd it's so bad. Now, add in nearly 9 references to the blue or red pill in that first hour, take away all but two measly special effects that you've seen before (correct NOTHING NEW in the way of ANY MATRIX universe - and you'll have seen a groundbreaking franchise get dumped on by the Guiness book of world records largest turd of dialogue and mood for dummies. The guy dropping the turd? One of the WIchowskis herself. As if to be so unaware of what made the originals popular and lacking the skill to produce something new, let alone something that isn't a total soapy trope and full of self-love and audience numbness from the utter shock it could be THIS BAD! To give an example, I went in with expectations it was going to be bad - with the hope (and usual correct assumption) that this outlook will still give me some satisfaction for lowered expectations. ALAS, however, it is one of the very few times in thousands of movies I've watched, where this actually didn't work. You'd have to go in with mood of seeing the worst movie of all time and prepare for it to maybe even extract one inkling of satisfaction from it - and that is me being generous - I actually think there is no way to watch this and have a greater than 0.5 stars. I just cannot imagine it. Worse still - I am surprised by critics reviews constantly - they live in their own world and like what they like, they don't represent me, who does the same thing without getting paid for it.. I can rationalize their depravity in the movie world - but USERS REVIEWS are basically the same for this? Laughable. Here I take bets with anyone, that both these scores will trickle down further as the movie ages -- that is if it doesn't get burried under licnesing deals, and really is heard of only as much as Superman IV 80s franchise was (of which many reading this may not know exists). That couldn't even get played in theaters - but I guarantee you, despite the frustration with that movie, it is still on top of this one. I would love to go on and relate it to other movies and moods - and I could do so for likely hours upon hours for this films first 60 minutes alone.\n\nSO THE SHORT VERSION: do not buy, do not rent, don't watch a trailer, block it from coming up in your newsfeeds, and just tell yourself now to completely skip it, or if you must, then make sure you follow the famous 10 minute rule of show watching-- if the movie doesn't draw you into it in the first 10 minutes, it will be a stinker, and no amount of time beyond that shall be acceptable, for this type of movie will yank another hour of your life leaving you slightly more angry as before, and instead of going to see some action-ish movie with crap thrown all around it. I say this to save you, the reader, and slam the series of money lenders that thought it'd be fun to waste their dollars on an insane project that should still be in tightening up the script (rather, throwing it away and getting someone to write an interesting one. Just to top it all off, this could have been 20 years of preparing to see cgi updates and effects, and diving into more relavent science that would make this universe cool again - but instead a first time writer wrote upside down while sleeping to make this time-waster-irritator movie. I'd never tell you how to spend your freetime, but at least I can strongly warn you about it - and make it a contest - if you can beat me and watch it longer than 50 minutes, by all means comment and lets tease out the so many details  that went so many wrong.",

While their are good parts to the production, particularly in effects and post production elements, the good parts weren't ground breaking or pushing the industry with innovation in the way that the earlier movies did. \n\nAs for the rest - the plot was thin, unimaginable and for the most part predictable, even making fun of itself during the first act. The entire movie felted forced, which might be the case when the movie actually includes the line, \"Our beloved parent company, Warner Bros, has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy\". At times, it truly felt like that may be the only reason for the movies existence. The plot did not further the overall story arch in any big meaningful way, the deep dive into philosophy was gone, and all we were left with was a movie that relied on heavy-handed slapping's of nostalgia to crawl its way through to the end. \n\nThe previously well picked soundtrack and crafted orchestration that helped build the movies tension and feel are replaced with a bland mediocre effort. The acting was poor for the calibre of cast they signed on board and the choreography was extremely poor in franchise that had previously pushed the boundaries and dominated the film world. For an action franchise that previously brought some iconic gun battles our main character doesn't even pick up a single gun in this movie, and compared to previous iterations his superpowers are now limited to holding his hands in the air. He does, once attempt to fly - which results in him leaping about 1 foot from the ground in a poor attempt at humour.\n\nThe issue is this - If your not a huge fan of the old movies you may like this, but then the nostalgia is so heavy that you probably won't. If you were a huge Matrix fan, this movies is so far away from the original trilogy that you'll slowly begin to hate it as it plays out in front of you. There's no target audience that this movie finds the right balance for in any large part and as a huge Matrix fan myself, while i'l still watch the trilogy this entry is a terminator 3 - we'll all just pretend its not part of the set.",

At least 3 or 4 steps down.  I would take the awful CGI that was still more exciting that any fight scene in this one.  They tried to bring back the nostalgia for fights as well, using a LOT of the same moves done in the original movies.  But, executed poorly.  Everyone seemed to be 20 years older with their pace, the camera was too close, heck they were just trying to do too much in the same scene...which didn't work one bit.  \n\nAnd, predictable.

Casting Neil Patrick Harris was also very odd choice and felt a tad out of place for the film, although I also think his persona suited the character he played perfectly in a weird kind of way. Finally, the action, it's fun but also lacks the elements that wowed us in the original, partially due to the fact it stays kind of generic with some random over-the-top crap that, after while, sort of gets to the 'yawn and look at your watch' point.

            "content": "December 22, 2021\n\nDoes Neo control the Matrix or is it the Matrix that controls Neo? That's just one of the questions we're asking ourselves as \"The Matrix Resurrections\" starts to unravel. Others may include: Didn't Neo and Trinity die at the end of \"The Matrix Revolutions\"? If so, how are they alive now? Why is Morpheus a younger version of himself, not to mention played by a different actor, compared to the other major characters? With so many scene and dialogue parallels between \"Resurrections\" and the original \"Matrix,\" especially at the beginning, is the former simply regurgitating the latter?\n\nTo its credit, \"Resurrections\" eventually answers all these questions and more, and it does so in a mostly satisfactory and credible way (or at least as credible as any \"Matrix\" film can). One quality the heavy screenplay for \"Resurrections\" doesn't lack is exposition and it goes out of its way to clearly, if laboriously, explain why things are the way they are in the latest Matrix universe. It expounds so much, in fact, that even \"Matrix\" novices may be able to walk into this fourth installment of the once wildly popular franchise and understand what's happening. What's more is that no matter how familiar one is with either \"The Matrix\" films, comic books, novels, or video games, \"Resurrections\" keeps us engaged and wanting to understand more. And yet, by the end, no matter how many satisfying answers and payoffs the film provides, we're not quite sure it was worth our time, and we question its necessity.\n\nAfter the disappointing and much maligned \"Revolutions,\" you might be wondering if \"Resurrections\" was just a way for the studio and filmmakers to make amends. On the contrary, they take this new chapter seriously and perform their due diligence in terms of looking at the Matrix universe from a fresh angle. Writer-director Lana Wachowski, who, with her sister Lilly, wrote and helmed the original trilogy, doesn't mail anything in here, but instead makes the setup for \"Resurrections\" surprisingly clever and interesting.\n \nIn the film, six decades have passed since the events of \"Revolutions,\" and we learn the ceasefire Neo (Keanu Reeves) negotiated with the CPU of the machines has ended. You'll recall the underlying premise of \"The Matrix\" was that artificially intelligent machines took over the planet and essentially turned humans into dormant batteries, relegating their bodies to lie motionless in pods filled with pink goo as their minds were plugged in and distracted by the Matrix, a simulated reality of Earth that was monitored by agents. Humans in the Matrix live blindly and oblivious to the harsh truth that they are slaves, and the world is, in fact, an ashen wasteland, rife with pollution, gray skies, and dilapidated cities.\n\nWith peace between humans and machines now dissolved (after the machines learned they couldn't sustain themselves without humans' bioelectric energy powering them), the dystopia we saw in the original \"Matrix\" films has been reinstated. But just as the machines have regained power and control, a group of determined Resistance fighters have maintained hope that Neo is still \"The One,\" or savior, who can bring about everlasting balance and harmony, as the prophecy says.\n\nOne of these Resistance fighters is the fresh-faced Bugs (Jessica Henwick), who, with her operator Seq (Toby Onwumere), discovers a modal within the Matrix that is running old code in a continuous loop. The code renders scenes suspiciously like the classic opening sequence of the original \"Matrix,\" of which Bugs knows the history. It is in this modal that Bugs also finds a young version of Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), or rather, a programmed version of him. \n\nBug extrapolates that this anomalous modal could only mean one thing: Neo, or some remnant of him, still exists. And, as it turns out, a middle-aged Thomas Anderson (Neo's alternate identity) is indeed \"alive\" and well and living in the Matrix, and he's once again a programmer, although a much more respected one because this time around he's the brains behind a highly lauded and successful video game called, wouldn't you know, \"The Matrix.\" \n\nYes, \"Mr. Anderson,\" as his business partner Smith (Jonathan Groff) calls him, works for a software company called Deus Machina and he's designed and developed a game trilogy that mirrors \"The Matrix\" movie trilogy. This aspect of the plot naturally makes for some snappy, elbow-nudging meta as Neo's cohorts, including the obnoxious Jude (Andrew Lewis Caldwell), all talk \"Matrix,\" opining on the series' virtues, shortcomings, deeper meanings, influence on pop culture, etc. The movie, as we're watching it, has just enough self-awareness and winks to the camera without going overboard and becoming smug or exhausting. \n\nFortunately, the film's self-analysis serves a purpose beyond just making it cute and savvy. The constant discussion and insights into \"The Matrix\" perpetuate Thomas' beliefs that he didn't just dream up the idea for the game randomly or through luck, but that it's somehow an extension of his true self and reflects his real-life memories. But how can that be? Isn't he currently living his one and only real life?\n\nThis cognitive dissonance eats away at Thomas, and despite being a popular game designer, he's a tortured individual\u2014lonely, anxious, and anti-social. The little happiness he does feel comes from his frequenting a coffee shop and observing a woman from afar named Tiffany (Carrie-Anne Moss), although we know her as Trinity. She's always there with her kids and husband, and without knowing exactly why, Thomas senses a deep connection to her, and when they finally meet, she feels it too.\n\nAt the same time, Thomas is haunted by trippy visions and intense moments of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, which he relates to his psychiatrist (Neil Patrick Harris), but his doctor insists his nightmares and dark thoughts are merely the result of irrational triggers and that Thomas should just keep taking the blue pills he's been prescribed to keep his mind at ease. Of course, \"Matrix\" veterans know it is the blue pill, versus the red one, that prevents him from thinking clearly and seeing the world for what it really is. When Thomas simply can't take it anymore, and the sites of black cats and mirrors drive him to the point of near mania, he feels he has no choice but to end things by jumping off a building. \n\nThat's where Bugs and company come in, and in typical \"Matrix\"-style, she and her crew rescue Neo's physical body and introduce him to the real world\u2014again. From here, what transpires is not too far removed from the trajectory of the original \"Matrix\": Neo \"wakes up\" and becomes acquainted with flesh and blood humans; he's informed about dire state of the world and learns what happened over the past 60 years, which includes the beloved city of Zion getting destroyed and a new city, IO, being founded by Niobe (a heavily made up Jada Pinkett Smith, reprising her role from the last two films) and other survivors; and Neo and his fellow Resistance fighters embarking on a rescue mission, this time to save Trinity. Naturally, revved up shootouts, car and motorcycle chase sequence, and gravity-defying, bullet time right scenes ensure.\n\nOf course, there are many more details, updates, and new (as well as old) characters to speak of, which I won't reveal, and all these hold our attention and keep \"The Matrix Resurrections\" moving at a solid pace. Despite its too long runtime (it clocks in at just under two and a half hours), the plot is always interesting, the visuals are consistently sharp and striking, and the special effects are once again state of the art. Plus, there are a few unexpected plot twists and moments of witty humor that catch us off guard, such as when Neo responds to the question of whether he can still fly.\n\nWhat's also surprising is how much we come to genuinely care about the human characters and their yearning for love and freedom. Wachowski develops them beyond just slick-looking, cartoonish people donning black trench coats and cool sunglasses. The movie pauses enough and gives the characters enough one-on-one screen time to have real conversations about what they think and desire, especially Neo and Trinity, whose relationship takes on greater meaning than before, perhaps because we see shots of their younger selves from the original trilogy intercut with their present ones, which allows us to gain a sense of their history. This sincere human element is something we don't expect from a \"Matrix\" movie.\n\nAnd yet, with all this said, as impressed as we may be by the quality and effort put into this third sequel, and as much as it doesn't come across merely as a hollow cash grab, \"The Matrix Resurrections\" ultimately lacks spark. It's rhythmic and thoughtful, sure, but it's also too slow and the energy level never spikes beyond a certain threshold to make us feel excited or put us in a state of awe and/or eager anticipation the way the other films in the series did (or any good film does). The action sequences, as well produced and convincing as they are, are more admirable than entertaining. And as much as they give to it, the filmmakers and returning cast members seem tired. We sense their dedication but not their enthusiasm. It's as if a part of them is always asking, \"Wait, why are we making this again?\" I'm not sure they know, and their perceived uncertainty affects us, because it leads us to ask, \"Wait, why are watching this again?\"\n\nPerhaps this was inevitable, given the amount of time that has passed between the original \"Matrix\" trilogy and \"Resurrections.\" As franchises age, they simply can't have the same impact they once had, and because \"Resurrections\" doesn't ignite us to the point where we feel we must keep watching it, I can't quite recommend it. It does hold viewers, but it's not essential viewing. If there's going to be a \"Matrix 5,\" I would suggest it be driven by a whole new set of characters struggling with a conflict other than human versus machine. I don't know what the story could be, but if the plan is to keep this franchise going, I think it needs to break away from what it's already done and the people it already knows. As Morpheus once said, it needs to \"let it all go.\" Maybe then, \"The Matrix\" series can leap into territory and once again make us say, \"Whoa.\"",

            "content": "I know that this installment was not the greatest and fell short of what expectations were. But here is where is actually succeeds. Even back in 2003 when Matrix: Reloaded and Revolutions came out, we didn't even have social media apps and smart technology. Flip phones were still still in have demand. Cell phones were still pretty fresh in the commodities category back then. Laptops and computers and all technology has evolved since the original trilogy came out. It incorporated all of that into the world of the Matrix franchise. It wasn't an easy task. I think Lana Wachowski without her sister Lily did a good job by herself. The way they brought both Neo and Trinity back was very well done and creative. I thought that they were going the path of cloning half way through the film since Neo couldn't use his full power. The retcon that they together are the ones does on further reflection make sense. While a lot of this film has some feeling of it being a rehash of the original and to some degree it is but it does really differ and scores huge continuing the story. That's the big thing here, it's not a reboot it's a continuation. It also showed us that in timeline within the 60 years since the third film that there has been heavy repercussions and more questions left unanswered and more questions now asked. I would also like to add that if it hadn't come out around the same time as Spider-Man: No Way Home that Box office-wise it would have done spectacularly. Not to take away from Spider-Man, that film was flat out textbook spectacular and deserves all of its attention. I think that it will probably be some time again before we see another Matrix film but I hope that we do. Because again while it's not a perfect film like the the others were, it showed a lot of potential.\nI give as many stars as I game because it honestly deserves it. Why? Because critics all and all can be harsh and not enjoy a film for enjoyments sake. It's not a bad film. A bad film in my book would be a solid 20% critics and audiences. That's not the case here. \n\nWatch it and make your own opinions.",

Even Neil Patrick Harris's role as Thomas Anderson's counselor was secondary and did little to make the movie exciting. I also hated the fact that Morpheus was not played by the original actor. I also didn't understand why Neo's powers had been so seriously impacted. I mean, I get it that he was in the goo for a very long time, but so was Trinity, and she came out of the goo a badass while Neo was a sad shell of himself. And speaking of time, Neo appeared as an old man to other people, but Trinity did not appear to have aged, and she was arguably in the goo for the same amount of time. So...what's up with that?\n\nAnyway, I just didn't see the need to bring this franchise back in this way. Where are the real enemies, the machines behind the Matrix? If this movie would have gone in a different direction, such as Neo, Trinity and the Zion crew taking down the Matrix for good instead, that would have been awesome. Maybe they've got that planned for another sequel. But I don't know if I will watch it, after watching Resurrections.

I'd say there's no point worrying about spoilers, because there's nothing inside to take a look. \n\nTo be honest, \"The Matrix Resurrections\" should be studied as a spectacular example of how to write an entire 2 hours movie without having delivered anything important in the end, which is actually the function of a movie trailer.\n\nTalking about the movie trailer, at first you can even forgive the abuse of Jefferson Airplane's \"White Rabbit\" track in yet another pseudo-philosophical movie -- I mean, let's not be so picky. It's Matrix. But the whole story is already condensed there - it's about the preparation (resurrecting Neo and Trinity) to fight within a very different matrix universe, which takes place after the context of the first movies. \n\nThat premisse is ok and there's interesting news actually. But everything in the movie happens as if something important is about to happen, until the movie ends. I mean, there is no solution presented for any of the great issues raised. It's just a parade of performances. It's so bizarrely bad that it seems the \"action\" scenes themselves don't serve as part of the main plot story, until you get that the preparation itself is the main plot.\n\nCurious to think that Neo's character within the Matrix illusion is now a famous video game producer. As a film The Matrix Resurrections almost replicates the critical failure of a highly anticipated video game called \"Cyberpunk 2077\", to which Keanu Reeves sold his image rights, and which was released a lot more flawed than this.\n\nBottom line about blockbusters, publicity blue pill will always win.",

            "content": "Matrix: resurrection \u2026 \"Following the white rabbit down the hole of nostalgia and disappointment\"\nWarning: If you are a matrix hard core fan, who still remembers by heart the trilogy's storyline, reciting it down to verbatim wordings of the dialogue and spent days debating meanings, hidden theories, futuristic ideas as well as visionary action scenes, then i am sorry to tell you that the so called 4th installment is definitely NOT for you. \nThere was a reason why the original story ended in the trilogy. Reason is simple; the story concluded with the 3rd installation (Matrix:Revolutions), as per the Washowski's own words. We should have noticed the warning signs when one of the Washowskis, refused to share in this movie and preferred to have nothing to do with their only memorable cinematic creation! Clearly Warner Bros had a different opinion and wanted to continue milking the success of the Matrix-verse till the very last penny, even if it was on the expense of millions of fans worldwide who hold the trilogy so dear.\nSitting in theatre waiting for the movie to begin gave me goosebumps. It felt like being in a time capsule going back in time. To my surprise, when the movie started, it literally felt so. I  went back in time to the old movies but time froze there. Resurrection takes everything you loved about the Matrix trilogy and turns it into a bad joke.\nThe movie opens with a remake of the famous Trinity escape scene from the \"the Matrix\" then goes on a series of flashbacks\u2026.. A LOT of them. For the first hour, we get actual scenes from the original trilogy embedded in the new installation. It felt more like a documentary for a whole hour and sarcastically enough with documentary style comments from the current movie actors on the previous scenes :(((\nThe only significant new thing you could identify in that movie is Aging. Everyone aged significantly, and seems that there were no attempts from the movie makers to conceal this fact. Keanu Reeves (Neo) aged and metamorphosed into John Wick. Yes! you didn't misread this. For some reason, Keanu reeves looks have nothing to do with the Matrix's Neo but feel more as if he just left the shooting set of John Wick and walked across the street into the Matrix resurrection studio!!!! The only difference between Neo and John Wick in this movie is that Neo did not carry any guns. Wait what?!!!  Yes, thoughout the movie, he didn't bear any firearms. Instead, NEO relied on his vanishing charisma, innocent loving eye look, and some remnants of the old Kung-fu he once learned in a simulation program (revise \"the Matrix\" if you didn't see it) that he became obviously very slow at compared to previous movies. Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) aged, paled, slowed, married with 2 kids, yet continues to rely on her loving eye looks to Neo. Somehow Matrix developed into a Titanic love story. \nThe gruesome plot line is based on the strong love connection between Neo and Trinity that has the power to tear the Matrix apart if they united. The new world built by the creepy analyst (Neil Patrik Harris) is based on keeping the love birds separated to harness their energy and in the same time stop them from re-uniting to avoid destroying the Matrix perfect weave.\n\"Matrix Resurrections\" depicts NEO trapped in a new matrix as a virtual reality games developer who ironically developed a game called the Matrix that has grown into 3 universally famous parts. Of course despite being rich, successful and famous, Neo continued  to have his doubts about his reality and feelings that something is wrong (familiar?! ;)). Ironically, the whole world now is just a video game and every body is hooked. Sounds very real to me.\nThe movie mocks itself harshly from the beginning till the Marvel-style cartoonish post-credits scene. Marvel has infested this era's movies with its post-credits scene routine. Here, we get this supposedly funny scene showing Neo's video game developing team brain-storming about the reasons behind the popularity of the Matrix.\nWe get a fresh Agent smith (Johnathan Groff),  Neo's nemesis, a newer younger actor who did good to be fair, but the shoes he had to fill (Hugo Weaving original Smith) are too big for him, Nice try though.\nThe New Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen) did his best to get out of the mantle of  Laurence Fishburne (original Morpheus) however he takes the route of mockery and bashes his predecessor's scenes starting with infamous blue/Red pill scene, saying \"i should be more dramatic as he was, right\" then exodes in a manic laughter!!\nPriyanka Chopra, the movie could survive without her. Didn't see any reason for her being here except for the big bucks for both herself and Warner Bros. \nPersonally, i felt awful seeing how Resurrection reduced the wise and powerful french mastermind, the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) from \"the Matrix:Reloaded\" into a vagabond creepy purged program that kept screaming and ranting in french for over 3 useless minutes before being blown away.\nAction and effects are so mind boggling terrible.  Music score is definitely a disaster.\nVerdict: 5/10\nI really hope we wouldn't see a remake of \"the God Father\" or any of the other famous trilogies. Please stop ruining our memories",

Far is the idea of \u200b\u200ba work of art and the philosophy that surrounded the script.  The green filters that characterized each scene in the Matrix have disappeared, the agents as we know them do not exist, so they have lost their essence.  \n\nThe soundtrack for me is one of the worst things in the movie, with this I do not mean that the music is bad, but it is not the Matrix.  And no longer say that Neo is not represented as the chosen one but as a weak image of which only the shadow remains, empowering Trinitty with the power of flight, which makes no sense since she is not the ONE.  \n\nIn the scene where Trinitty is flying and Neo is not, she holds Neo and he is hanging, a ridiculous scene, since Neo, having sacrificed so much, appears so weak.  \n\nI understand that the director wanted to update the version of Matrix, but Matrix 4 seems to me to be another action movie that is far from being a piece of art as it was in previous movies.  There are movies that are better left as they are.",

I loved its timely exploration of the meaning of \"truth\", personal choice, and the definition of sanity.

I loved that the cinematography is totally different, tighter, and more claustrophobic as if seeing something familiar through an entirely new lens.
