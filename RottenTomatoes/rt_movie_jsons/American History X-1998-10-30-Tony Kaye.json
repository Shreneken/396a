            "content": "American History X is a thought-provoking and powerful film that tackles themes of racism, hate, and redemption. Directed by Tony Kaye and starring Edward Norton in a career-defining role, this film is a must-watch for anyone interested in exploring the complex issues of racial tension and violence in America.\n\nThe film tells the story of Derek Vinyard, a former neo-Nazi skinhead who is released from prison after serving time for a racially motivated murder. As Derek tries to rebuild his life and repair his relationship with his family, he must confront the hate and bigotry that once consumed him.\n\nThe performances in American History X are simply outstanding, with Norton delivering a stunning portrayal of a man struggling to confront the demons of his past. The supporting cast, including Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, and Stacy Keach, are all excellent as well, bringing a depth and complexity to their characters that makes them feel real and relatable.\n\nBut what really sets American History X apart is its unflinching and uncompromising examination of racism and hate. The film doesn't shy away from the ugliness of these issues, but instead confronts them head-on, challenging viewers to examine their own beliefs and prejudices.\n\nThe film's cinematography and score are also noteworthy, with the use of black-and-white and color sequences adding to the film's emotional impact, and the haunting score by Anne Dudley perfectly capturing the film's somber tone.\n\nIn conclusion, American History X is a must-watch film that tackles important and timely issues in a powerful and thought-provoking way. With its outstanding performances, uncompromising examination of racism and hate, and haunting cinematography and score, it's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",

Although some scenes are interesting, other ones are boring and dull and just drowning with racism and the problems of modern America. Edward Norton who is often very dull as an actor plays the lead character who is abusive and angry, as well as violent and an overall bad person. The writers were pumped to get him to kill black actors during the script, but the story is bland because it's about ignorant white Americans who fill up the movie with their dumb subplots and side stories. Rather than juxtapose it with anything of value, it allows itself to rest on the idiocy of the masses to find it to be an audacious source of film-watching.",

Admittedly, underestimation's generally inevitable, but it becomes a rewarding realization once you watch the film to feel its true power that mostly justifies its acclaimed stature in ranking adjacence to similarly artistically mature films within the decade. Although fueled irrationally but proven as timely relevant as the sadly realized truth on how far a mind can sink pretentiously over inhumane beliefs, therefore hindering the overall American dream as the country's violent, mindless stains unreasonably holding grudging prejudices that are frustratingly lingering today still. A sympathetic direction with analyzed pity and understandable roots as insight where their nonsensical argument originates, with demonstrative performances boldly embodying those beliefs with replicated convictions over realism that certified this as a mature educational value whereas its entertainment lies between narrative energy and aesthetics. Its front does present a notorious nature like a passerby judgement but layered with depth makes it enthralling despite the pitifully nasty, discomforting vibe slurred through negative dialogue nicely deflected.

It definitely took time to adjust to the half of the movie which was shown with a large emphasis on portraying the story subjectively through the nazi's perspective (showing the childhood nostalgia through scenes that mimicked the style and substance of Triumph of the Will) and I can understand how some might have stopped the movie halfway through seeing it as racist drivel, but when paired with the documentary-style color segments the meaning becomes incredibly clear. I definitely enjoyed how all of the imagery and stylistic devices were used in such a clear and pretty straightforward way all pointing in the direction of one sole vision. This movie is incredibly cohesive in that way, with each choice having a specific purpose leading into the overall meaning, becoming incredibly clear by the time you reach the finale. The only problem I could bring up with the movie is at times its bluntness and lack of subtlety with how it handled its overall message did come off a tad preachy, but on the other hand, with the number of nazis who somehow watched this movie and saw it on their saw side, I guess it could be argued it wasn't blunt enough. Overall, a pretty fantastic movie whose politics still feel just as important today. Highly recommend it, although it definitely could be a tough watch for some.",

Ive only ever watched this movie once a long time ago. I remember most of it vividly and half of it not at all. Guess which parts I vividly remember.....yeah. Thats why I only watched it once. Its just a little powerful and too effective at what they do here. Thats not a negative. Its an amazing positive. I just could only absorb this once. Be warned, this isnt your snowflake directors social justice message. Its about telling a story about one mans journey from one side to the other. I love how directors were able to tell storys in this fashion without stepping on the viewers personal beliefs. If you really want to get through to people, study this formula.

I'm just tired of it.\" ~ Derek Vineyard\n\nSo it was too tough of a choice that i picked two of my favorite quotes from American History X as they both tie into each other so perfectly. The message being that blaming everything and everyone for your problems won't ever end the way you want it to. Theres no light at the end of the tunnel on that path. \nDerek Vineyard has recently been paroled after a 3 year sentence after he committed a brutal double murder after two black men attempted to break into his truck after a disagreement on the basketball court. Through the narration of his little brother Danny we learn the real roots of his brothers anger and brutality, he once was a bright young man until the death of their father which deeply affected him. Derek grew into a neo-nazi skinhead and the number 2 of a violent white supremacist gang that gained some notoriety in L.A. for the heinous racially motivated crimes they committed. Once locked away Derek finally gains some perspective befriending another black inmate and listening for once. Three years in prison can change a lot in a man, Derek has an earth shattering moment in prison that changed him forever and he was never quite the same again. Now reformed he is in a race against time to sever ties from his following, reconcile with his mother and sister, and prevent his little brother Danny from succumbing to the same grim fate. This film has no happy ending, as in life every action has positive and negative repercussions, you can't escape fate.",

            "content": "One of the more controversial films of 1998 this is a film that I find to be a rather glib examination of what drives a man to be a white supremacist and how he could be converted. Fortunately at the center of the film there is a very strong performance from the talented Edward Norton that makes the film worth watching. It is not that I don't think that films should explore this issue as it is important to trace what places these dangerous ideas in the minds of impressionable youths and to show that there is a way to change the views of the most corrosive members of society but sadly this film does not do so adequately.\n\nDerek Vinyard, Edward Norton, became a white supremacist as a result of his father's racist views and eventual death as a result of African-American drug dealers shooting him. He rises up through the ranks quickly in the white supremacist organization Disciples of Christ and influences his impressionable younger brother Danny, Edward Furlong, into adopting his views. He is imprisoned after murdering an African-American and while in prison his prejudices are successfully challenged by African-American inmate Lamont, Guy Torry. He changes his beliefs and is raped by other white supremacists in the prison as a result. When he is released he makes a desperate attempt to convert his younger brother, who is deeply entrenched in the organization, into a non-racist while disassociating himself from his former friends. Danny has been forced to write an essay discussing his brother after provoking his Jewish history teacher Mr. Murray, Elliott Gould, by writing about Mein Kampf. The two bond and after having a serious discussion about race relations Danny is converted and breaks free from the bonds of racism but tragedy befalls him.\n\nThe idea that a child would take on the views of their parent is certainly believable as at age ten I took on almost all of the beliefs that my father held, fortunately they were mostly about films. This film did not do enough however to establish Vinyard taking in his father's dangerous ideology as one scene in which his views on \"Native Son\" are challenged seemed too little to convince. We have previously seen Vinyard's racist rant on television and his angry attack on his teacher at a family lunch but there is more that should be there to support his transition from innocent kid to aggressive racist. There are similar issues in the film's depiction of his loss of his racist views. There is a sort of a \"Magical negro\" character who is kind to this man who hates him for no reason other than the color of his skin and seems to exist purely to educate him. One particularly laughable scene displays Norton reading a book about African-American history and nodding his head as though in acknowledgement of the fact that the author makes some good points. This is the sort of scene that makes his conversion seem like such a construct and the brevity with which it is seen is disappointing considering the fact that it is what the film turns on.\n\nThere are also issues with the way the film in some ways glamorizes white supremacy with a shot of Norton arms outstretched to the sound of gospel music in the background as he is being arrested for murdering a black man truly making him appear like a sympathetic, godlike figure. The wrong person could latch on to this film and see the supremacists as cool and alternative instead of the disgusting, prejudiced people they are. Kaye would have done better not to present Vinyard as a hagiographic figure but to film him during this period of the film as a small, detestable figure who holds no real power and deserves to be looked down upon.\n\nWhat anchors the film is Norton's impressive performance as he totally commits being utterly terrifying as the horrifying racist and surprisingly convincing as the weak young man susceptible to his father's views. Despite the poor screenplay that cuts corners where it shouldn't have he brings an intensity to the role that is necessary and he does make the story on some level believable.",

I've been told that I'm racist for the silliest superficial reasons by some who really have no idea what it even means.  They've cheapened the phrase to mean absolutely nothing.  Am I perfect?

This felt very independent politically, which was really refreshing considering the subject matter.

When the main character was exiting prison and had a conversation with his co-worker, it was touching to see his change in attitude toward those of other races and that harmony can exist between the races. I was reminded of Revelation 5:9 and how God has redeemed his children \"out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation\".\n\nThe other moment was in the cafe, near the end, where the main character is placed in a position to make a decision of whether to try and better society or to take the easy route. We've all been there, and it's easy to relate to this tough spot.\n\nOtherwise, this movie was mostly misleading propaganda. They paint in an unflattering light anyone who views affirmative action as wrong, or any other programs designed to divide the races instead of unite them. For the unsuspecting and feebleminded, they'll buy into the notion that to dislike such programs is to be equivalent to a Nazi.\n\nAnother logical flaw is the conclusion of the film making the point that hate is bad. Certainly, bitterness and unwarranted hate is not good and can eat away at our souls. However, hate in and of itself is not bad. How can it be, when God himself hates (\"The Lord trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.\" - Psalm 11:5, and others)? Hating wickedness is a good thing.\n\nHere, we have run into the primary problem with this and other Hollywood presentations...a lack of integration with biblical ideals. When we leave out the Lord's truth and wisdom, the result will be a skewed perspective which leads to more and more confusion.\n\nSociety's ills like racism, murder, affirmative action, or whatever it may be, will only be solved by the Lord Jesus Christ and his ways. This film presents problems and shows the main character attempting to walk away from the Nazi lifestyle. But leaving one evil may only mean we head for another evil. Let us do what the film never addresses...walk toward holiness and righteousness through the one who is the very definition of righteousness.",

Edward Norton was fantastic in this film and Edward Furlong was great in it too. The acting in this film is phenomenal. I cried at the end of the film. The movie is about two brothers, one being an adult and the younger one being a teenager. The older brother, Derek, was a racist white supremacist. The younger brother, Danny, is a white teenager who looks up to his older brother who is beloved and worshiped by a ton of other racist white people. Derek grew up hating black people and Danny hops on the racist train. One night, he murders three black men invading their property outside of their house by shooting them with a pistol and kills the last one by stomping on his head when he had his mouth on the curb in the street. He gets arrested for murder and stays in prison for like six years. While he is in prison, he eventually befriends a black prisoner. When he's finally released from prison he becomes a changed man forever. He becomes subtle and tolerant towards people of all races and religions, but his younger brother is still a bigot and still sees him as he was before his arrest and looks up to him. Danny gets in trouble at school and gets sent to the principal's office for doing a history report on Mein Kempf. The report was supposed to be on someone he looks up to as a hero, but he chose Adolf Hitler as his hero in his history report. The principal (who is black) punishes him by making him redo his report on his brother instead. So Danny goes home and his brother Derek (whom he lives with) gets a phone call from the principal and hears everything about what Danny did at school.  Derek gets invited to a white supremacist party and tells Danny to stay home and do his report and not to come to the party with him. At the party, Derek eventually opens up to everyone there who worships him and looks up to him like he's some kind of god that he doesn't believe in white supremacy and white superiority anymore and that he doesn't  believe in all that racist bullshit anymore, which soon causes everyone at the party including his close friend and girlfriend disappointed in and pissed at him. Danny sneaked in the party and is even disappointed and upset about the whole tirade about Derek being tolerant of blacks and other minorities. Derek escorts Danny out of the party and explains to him everything about his time in prison and what made him change completely. After his long story ends, Danny hates it at first, but then soon changes too. Derek and Danny both go home and they get rid of all the Nazi and racist propaganda and stuff in his room. Then Danny finished typing in and printing out his report. The next day at school, Danny gets shot dead by one of the black teenagers who was related to one of the black men who was murdered by his brother. Derek comes in and discovers Danny's bloody body in the bathroom and cries and morns for his brother while feeling guilt. One of the most emotional endings in film history.\n\nRating: 8.9/10",

Tony Kaye has only produced five movies his entire life, all rated over a six out of ten. \"American History X\" was his very first movie, made in 1998 in Los Angeles, California. Not only did he direct it he also did the cinematography. In the film, it presents a glimpse of what white supremacist looked like around the 90's. Showing a transition between black and white for the past and color for the present. Main characters Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and his younger brother Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) not only played great roles but staying in character was their best part. Derek started a neo-nazi skinhead group, violating and discriminating any other race that came in their way, then follows the incarceration of Derek from an incident involving two African American males. The transition following his imprisonment included ironically befriending an African American male. Finally realizing he doesn't want to be a part of that lifestyle any longer, he finds himself trying to save his brother from becoming what he once was. He struggles daily with his past decisions, hoping to bring his family out of it. During the foreseeable yet tragic ending, with only a few minutes left of the film, Kaye ended it with heartfelt instrumental music and the view of a sunset on California's beach. I feel it should have ended differently, but where it stands shocks everyone. Giving it a sad, yet comforting mood. Creating a satisfying, and heartbreaking film, rating this movie an eight out of ten.",

It's also terrific in its brotherly relationship, important in its story and very well paced and shot throughout. But Edward Norton was never believable to me as a neo-Nazi skinhead. He becomes better and very good in the second half, but in the first half he evidently struggled.

            "content": "American History X has one of the most compelling stories I've seen in movies in a while. It's a gut-wrenching, and heartbreaking story. But Tony Kaye's powerful and challenging direction is what made the movie so provocative.\n\nThe movie also proves that Edward Norton has a huge talent that, unfortunately, has been wasted. Norton delivered the performance of his career in this movie. A performance that elevated the entire movie. While Derek Vinyard, Norton's character, has the most powerful lines in the movie, they wouldn't have been as powerful as they are without Edward Norton's staggering delivering.\n\nAlso, Edward Norton's performance may be the only thing that remained sharp and solid throughout the whole movie. Because aside from Norton's riveting and smart monologues, the dialogue in this movie, especially at the first two acts, is so weak and often cheesy! The things got better at the last act but at that time I was wondering why the dialogue wasn't that good most of the movie. It's really baffling because the movie needed badly to have a decent and strong dialogue from its beginning, considering its subject matter. The dialogue often was too on the nose and preachy while it should have served its already gripping story. That also made some scenes in the movie feel so awkward and heavy-handed.\n\nThe dialogue isn't the only, or the biggest issue I've with American History X. As I think that everything related to the Neo Nazi gang is completely underdeveloped. All the characters of the members of this gang are one-dimensional characters. They are totally undeveloped and bland, and almost have no depth. Which is a shame because they play a pivotal part in the story. They are part of the main plot, so to speak.\n\nBesides that balancing between two contradictory aspects of the story, Tony Kaye with his mixture of black & white history contrasting with colorful reality is magic to absorb and shows this film up to be what it is. Smoothly moving camera in the scenes in Black and White that are set in the past to convey an unsettling feeling, and bleak and restrained colored scenes to match the dystopian-like present.\n\nAmerican History X also has one of the most shocking endings ever. But its ambiguity is what makes it more dreadful. It's an ending that can make you question the protagonist's fate, and that's more than horrifying!\n\n(8/10)",

It focuses in on a neo-Nazi and tells how the events in his life filled him with hate, and how his hate has affected his family and friends. The big relationship in the film is between this man and his younger brother who idolizes him and wants to follow in his footsteps. I thought they did an admirable job of making it clear that the ideals these boys were fighting for are awful, but they themselves are not pure evil and might have some good in them. I didn\u2019t like how they setup this plot point, though. The weird writing assignment that started the whole story was kind of odd and felt forced. I just didn\u2019t think it fit with the structure of the film. Edward Norton was superb as he always tends to be when he commits to a role. There are at least 3 or 4 different stages in the journey of this character that he has to portray and I think he nails them all. From the beginning when he\u2019s pure rage, to the flashbacks where he\u2019s somewhat innocent, and then the later scenes where he\u2019s repentant, you can track that journey without it being an open topic of discussion. He makes it all clear through his behavior. Edward Furlong is also amazing as the younger brother. He hits that perfect balance of presenting himself as an adult who has his mind made up and is in control of everything, but also betraying an underlying innocence that shows he\u2019s only following others down a path and hasn\u2019t truly decided for himself. The artistic choice of using black-and-white for flashbacks and color for the present day scenes worked for me also. It spoke to the changing mindset of Norton\u2019s character, and also made those flashbacks feel grittier. I found this movie engaging and authentic, but also hard to watch. It goes on the list of films that I respect, but I can\u2019t imagine sitting through it again. It\u2019s not that the story is structured poorly or that it was boring, nothing that would typically keep me away from re-watching a movie. In this case it\u2019s just the fact that many of the events are depressing and the ideals we see espoused are hard to swallow. American History X is a solid film, and I think the point it makes is one we all need to hear. But I\u2019ve heard it once now, and I don\u2019t need to go through that again.",

He puts in an amazingly convincing performance as Derek, this vile, hateful white supremacist. Then when the character is broken down and tries to become a better person, he shows layer upon layer of damage and vulnerability that lies underneath. Edward Furlong puts in a good performance as Danny, Derek's impressionable, younger brother who idolises Derek but is also manipulated by Cameron Alexander, played by Stacy Keach, into doing his dirty work. Beverly D'Angelo is also excellent as Doris, Derek's mother and the progression of her character from flash back to present day is well played.\nThis is a very brutal and sometimes difficult to watch film that explores the cycle of hatred and how racism can be spread and passed down through generations. However because it doesn't mince its words the film's message is that much more potent and impactful on the audience. The cinematography is also excellent and the use of black and white in the flash backs adds another dimension to an issue that is most certainly grey. \n\nI would certainly recommend this film as the issues it tackles are still very relevant to this day.",

I was hooked instantly. It could've been so much plainer if we had followed Derek's story from its conception, but having it turned into this life analysis from Danny's point of view was a very smart decision. It helped keep the movie's pace going, helped me as a viewer stay at attention. I wanted to get down to Derek's core.\n\nEdward Norton reminded me in this performance why I love him so much as an actor. Beautiful act, very raw and honest. A lot of moments of brilliance. The only slightly awkward part for me was when he was holding Danny's dead body and bawling his eyes out. His grimace kind of looked like laughter but with the sound switched to crying. Maybe that's just how his crying face looks like, but it felt a little awkward to me. Not a big point.\n\nEverybody else fit their role well. The mother's Jewish boyfriend acted in a surprisingly subdued way, considering the role. Sweeney's actor was fantastic. The laundry guy, Lamont, stole the show during his scenes. He did great.\n\nMovie was shot in a pretty decent way for the most part, with some amazing moments of brilliance. The editing was a standout, the music was alright, although a bit too in your face at times. Could've been a little subtler.\n\nIt was a brilliant look into this painful twisted world, it felt honest and very human. Felt intelligent in its depiction of every side of the story.\n\nThe standout moment for me was the part where Derek walks Danny in the morning to his school. The entire sequence is just amazingly orchestrated. Tension builds and builds, you scan the background behind them to spot incoming danger, and then the camera starts narrowing down and zooming onto the faces of Derek and Danny while you're on the edge, unable to see if there's any danger. It's obvious that something will happen, but the time leading up to it is an amazing ride. I thought to myself that I wish it didn't happen, but then it wouldn't be as good of a story. So well done.\n\nAmazing movie, highly recommended.",

Those high expectations were shattered with the incredible acting, heart wrenching, and soul churning scenes that unfold. This movie is extraordinary in every aspect. I enjoyed every aspect of the movie and would watch it again. The ending takes a stab into the viewers emotions, showing us the untimely death of our would-be protagonist. The scene only worsens when Derek rushes to the school and finds his younger brother lying dead in the urinal. The screams, shrieks, and cries from Derek nearly brought me to tears. The journey he had undergone, though revolutionary, was not enough to save his younger brother from the fate that was already sealed from following in his path of being a Neo-Nazi.\n\nThe journey that is shown throughout the movie, switching from black and white to color, beautifully shows the outlook on life which Derek abides by, separating those who are not White Protestants from anyone else. The color change is extraordinary to convey his character transformation.\n\nThe ending, as stated before, is one of the best scenes in the movie, pulling at the heart strings of the reader. Danny's fate is sealed once he blows the puff of smoke into the face of the African American student. This fate was carried out by Danny by worshiping the actions and ideology in which his older brother, Derek, dominated.\n\nThe opening scene of the car robbery set the mood for the rest of the movie, not pulling back any punches when it came to brutality. The opening scene, however, also showed the contempt that Danny has for the final actions of Derek. Derek's murder of two African American men attempting to break into his car changed Danny forever. This change, however, is suppressed by Danny in order to be more like his brother. When Danny discovers the massive change in Derek, his frustration is let out by pushing him against a garage many times. This anger seems to be coming from the confusion Danny now faces on whether to follow his brother again or stick to what he made himself believe.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing movie and I would recommend this to any friend.",

Norton clearly wants to ask you: \"Can Neo-Nazis reform? Can they change?\" At least, he shows you how they can come into being Nazis.\n\nAmerican History X is so powerful. It really speaks to the troubles we face even today. American History X paints a picture of how family, income, and one's outlook can depict and nurture or twist and warp someone into a hateful being. You get the background, the formation of a hate group, the people influencing them, the people that are trying to help these Nazis, and the few that may sincerely change and wake up from their hateful slumber.\n\nThe film itself is beautifully shot, switching from black and white sequences of the past that depict how this family fell apart. Then in color and gorgeous cinematography, how Edward Norton must take his family back and try to cut ties off of the white supremacist Neo-Nazis. It's all intense and suspenseful throughout, while also has brutal depictions of a very harsh life. Check American History X out for insights into our current era of hate and racially tense times.

            "content": "In 2016, I repeatedly watched legions of Americans, mostly whites, embrace and/or ignore Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric that dehumanized everyone who was not a white heterosexual man, and we rewarded him with the title of President of the United States. This tragedy reinforces the idea that Americans, and frankly humans, continue to fear what they do not understand, therefore cultivating unnecessarily harmful tension that frequently leads to conflict. This conflict makes us no different than our primitive descendants, and it undermines our potential to make the world a better place. I firmly believe American History X is a beacon of hope America needs to eventually overcome its racial divide, despite a President who will always fly the \"woe is the white race\" flag. \n\nThe film's backbone is unquestionably Edward Norton's performance as Derek Vinyard, a despicable and morally repugnant neo-Nazi who undergoes a believably human transformation. His unflinching and versatile performance gives credence to every line of dialogue and every action in every scene, which elevates all the performances in the film's supporting cast. As a result, I bought Vinyard's history and every interaction he has with his family, particularly his relationship with his younger brother.  I firmly believe Norton's performance is so outstanding that it is among  the five greatest performances of all-time. \n\nHowever, Norton's performance would not have been nearly as impactful if Tony Kaye's storytelling felt like a structured narrative. Though it is not nearly as experiential as Moonlight, I became emotionally attached to the characters because I concurrently bought them as people and the complicated world they all inhabited. Whomever accuses the film of being preachy or heavy-handed is simply not recognizing that its message organically arises vicariously through its characters during their transformations, particularly the Vinyard brothers. Last, but not least, I absolutely love that there is a particular line of dialogue that suggest Derek has not gone completely to the other side of the moral spectrum, which highlights the time and understanding it takes to ultimately get there. \n\nLast, but not least, I love that Tony Kaye chose to tint the flashback sequences black-and-white and the present sequences in color. The gimmick works tremendously because not only does it clearly illustrate what happens in the past and present, but it also illustrates how all the characters look at racism in those moments in time. Contrary to popular belief, race is unquestionably the most complicated issue that has plagued human history, yet we, especially Americans, continually try to categorically break it down into good and bad and/or right and wrong.  \n\nAs much as I love this film, I have a few quibbles with it. First, there are a couple scenes that have unnecessary exposition, both dialogue and voiceover. Second, there are a few times when Kaye uses a medium close-up instead of a regular close-up to show a character's reaction, though I understand why he chose to do so. Last, there is one scene where the rhetoric could have been toned down to dramatically play up the rhetoric's impact on a certain character.   \n\nOverall, this is an emotionally riveting film that tactfully dissects race and explores how hatred undermines and eventually destroys understanding on an interpersonal, a familial and a societal level. Most importantly, it demonstrates how anyone, no matter how racially insensitive, can redeem themselves from those harmful beliefs by simply exposing themselves to different people in different cultures in an open-minded effort to understand those people and their cultural backgrounds. \n\nThis film reminded me to not give up on Donald Trump and his ardent supporters because if we give up on them, then they will have no desire to change, which will only make the world a harsher and more violent place to live.",

The direction is good, but it's nothing specIal, and the film is neither great nor bad to look at. The screenplay is good, and it has it's moments. It has great dialogue, and four standout scenes, but the rest of it falls short and/or flat, and some character development for Norton's character was missing. There were some pacing problems, and there were some narration scenes. Edward Norton's narration was good, but the narration by Edward Furlong (His younger brother) felt boring. An aspect I liked a lot was the black and white used during flashback sequences, and the color used in present day scenes. I think it emphasized well Norton's change and development as a character.

The ending truly shocked me, and I found myself feeling much more for these characters than I expected to.

In terms of technical aspects Kayne's great to show the Flashbacks of our protagonist in black and white, and highlight the timeline, he wants to make us remember World War II, meaning that all such discrimination is a thing of the past, and narrative off of Danny and the family unit is great, because if we saw the film without these two aspects we do not apegar\u00edamos Derek, on the contrary, we'd hate, and hate is the opposite of what the film wants to preach, we we can not agree with Derek, but if we hate, we are not very different, the soundtrack is accurate, the picture is beautiful, especially in black and white times, the script is extremely intelligent, but leave some loose ends, and the performances are all great, especially Edward Norton, who is a great actor, but unlike the majority of his other films where he has a submissive and apathetic performance, not here, he is threatening, you really afraid, and yet he can pass the dramatic side, this is certainly one of the greatest performances of his career.

The pace of the story doesn't feel rushed at all; you can follow through every line and understand it very easily. As I say, it's a smooth sail from beginning to end. The acting was also great; you can see and feel their emotions at the same time, especially the two brothers. From the feeling of rage and confusion to the road of enlightenment, I can say it was perfect. The black and white scene of the past on cinematography is also beautiful. For me, it's not just a black and white color theme of the past; it is a view of what they actually see, how dark it is. It's just like you see, my past is grim, it's not that colorful unlike others, but it continue to hunt me and live within me every day. I can't throw it away easily and through time, it molded me. That's what I feel when watching it, the moment I feel myself to the characters, that's the moment I can say that this is an excellent movie. I will not make this long, to sum it up, overall, this is a great movie and you should watch it. That's all, Badum Tss!",

Edward Norton gives an amazing performance and somehow makes us empathize with him even though he is an extremely racist gang leader with a large Nazi symbol over his heart. If I had to say something bad about this movie, the music can be a little cheesy at points, especially with all the slow-motion, and that the cinematography was a bit annoying to watch at points. Whether is be axis jumps, awkward close-ups or just weird choices, it's hard to explain but, I don't know...

            "content": "Hate isn't something we're born with, unless you're Damien from \"The Omen\" or are fresh out of Rosemary's womb.  It is a feature of one's personality distinctly inspired by others - the kids of the Westboro Baptist Church didn't come into the world with the understanding that the right thing to do is to be homophobic and anti-Semitic.  They were taught these diseases.  Most of the population is able to cope by ignoring them, living bigot-free lives in the meantime - but knowing that groups believing that another race, religion, sexuality, etc., is so wrong that they would not oppose violence to oppress it is a terrifying, unsettling thing. \n\t\"American History X\" shines a light on to the scarring truths of neo-Nazism in the United States, informing us that groups committed to their hate, committed to viewing Adolf Hitler as a sort of misunderstood Jesus, is a very real, very scary reality.  Rationalism plays no part in their antics; it is rage that they disguise as social justice.  The film is frightening, upsetting, and visceral.  It is more relevant than ever, with Donald Trump's candidacy bringing out tucked away racism embedded in the worst individuals of the U.S.  \n\tSurprisingly, \"American History X\" is still, nevertheless, moving.  While it gives us a taste of the brutalities of neo-Nazism, it doesn't waste away potential by basking in a senselessly angry rhetoric.  There's a twist: what if one of the biggest doers of violence against minorities went to jail, realized his evils, and was reborn? The answer isn't as easy as we would like it to be.  But it's a captivating one.\n\tThe film opens with a distressful sequence that details a carjacking gone wrong - would-be thieves make the mistake of targeting the home of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a merciless neo-Nazi.  Being mostly black, they are murdered in methods ranging from vicious to grotesque.  Derek is sent to prison for three years, his younger brother, the impressionable, teenaged Danny (Edward Furlong), imitating his hateful tactics as he ages.\n\tThe present of the film is set during the window of the first few weeks of Derek's release.  Danny has just written a paper praising Mein Kampf, and the skinhead movement is growing.  But something in Derek has changed.  Gone is the evil that nested in his eyes before; his body language suggests someone no longer compelled to always be in attack mode.  \n\tFlashbacks, photographed in grimy black-and-white, reveal his metamorphosis, and we unromantically witness everything from Derek's sordid days as a sadistic \"leader\" to his eye-opening incarnation, where he forms such a strong bond with a fellow inmate (who happens to be black) that it causes him to rethink his hateful ways.\n\tSo the film is intent on acting as voyeur to Derek's desperate attempts to inspire Danny to reconsider his life, reconsider his beliefs and wonder aloud if over-the-top prejudice is a path worth traveling down.  \"American History X\" doesn't paint Derek as a saint (we very graphically see the atrocities of his past), making the film gripping because it analyzes what a shallow thing hate is in a thoughtful, nuanced way.\n\tTony Kaye's direction, unflinching and unbiased, presents the situation as is, letting the emotional undertones of the film hit us naturally, and, in some ways, guttingly.  His instincts complement David McKenna's brilliant screenplay with fluidity; McKenna, so easily able to go back and forth tonally (authentically characterizing a skinhead crime spree only to suddenly transition into Derek's regretful present), gives the film its magnetically flawed interior.  Kaye provides it with its instinctual exterior.  We are never less than transfixed.  It is even entertaining, despite its frequent dives into jerking uncomfortability.\n\tThe ensemble is just as monumentally stunning, if not more so.  Norton gives the performance of his career, embodying Derek with such commitment that to go from despising him to sympathizing with him does not feel like a cinematic manipulation; his portrayal is multifaceted in ways few actors can imitate.  We can feel his pain, his sorrow, his regret.  Though I wish more time was spent following Derek's descent from all-American teenagerisms to neo-Nazi masochism, it doesn't corrupt the power of Norton's characterization.\n\tFurlong is heartbreaking as Derek's vulnerable younger brother who will do anything to be accepted; in a climactic dinner scene that shows the moment during which their father passes his bigoted baton to Derek, Furlong is only a background figure.  But look at the way his eyes change, the way they see that hate equals acceptance, love.  Furlong's subtle facial idiosyncrasies and unconfident body language gives Danny a dimension that suggests that his hate is a result of social pressure, not of genuine disdain.\n\tEven the supporting players, whose good work could be overlooked when behind the ground-shattering performances of Norton and Furlong, enrapture us.  Beverly D'Angelo, the film's source of hope, is heartfelt as a mother disgusted by the sins of her sons that still manages to radiate with unwavering love; conversely, Fairuza Balk, as Derek's pre-prison girlfriend, disturbs with her inability to see past the fury that clouds her judgment.\n\tSociety will continue to contain pockets of narrow-minded individuals reactionary and caustic, but \"American History X\" uncovers the reality that racism and its fellow prejudices are something unfortunately characterized by the culture that surrounds them - hate, in truth, has no foundation besides a bottomless crevasse where misanthropy immortally lives.  The only way out is to open one's eyes; \"American History X\" is unmistakably hopeful and unmistakably timeless.",

But it's also nice to see some of these characters change, and see that \"hate is baggage.  Life's too short to be pissed off all the time.\"  The hate and the anger are powerful.  \n\nEdward Norton is simply remarkable here, and I'd raise his performance up against any single actor's performance in any film that I've seen.  It's really that good.  And sometimes, films only have that one iconic performance that holds together the movie.  While it's true that without Edward Norton, the film would have probably been average, awesome supporting roles including Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, and Ethan Suplee raises it to another level.  Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, goes through every gamut of emotion from love, to hate, to self doubt, respect, tolerance, and total despair.  It's a performance for the ages.\n\nI think what's most telling is the view of racism by the film's director, Tony Kaye, and writer, David McKenna.  Nobody wins.  Derek and Danny reform, yet tragedy strikes.  Seth and Cameron become more hateful than ever, and they get burned.  Black guys go for revenge, they either die or go to jail.  Nobody wins.  And it's something the world should be paying attention to.\n\nI think this is a very important film in the annals of Hollywood, from High School on up.  It's nearly required viewing, along with another film with a similar subject matter, called Higher Learning.  But Higher Learning didn't have Edward Norton.  Higher Learning didn't have quite the profound message.  All the performances were tour-de-force, and this film gets my highest recommendation.  Be aware of graphic violence, nudity, rape, and a lot of heavy language, from cursing, to racial slurs.  Some people put the film down saying that none of it was necessary, but, I say to that, in order to paint a quasi-realistic picture of the dark subject matter, there are no limitations.  Hate and anger get you nowhere.  Again, highest recommendation, and a part of my top 100.",

That's not to say that American History X is bad, but it's not as good as another similar movie that actually came out about four years after this one. It's called \"The Believer\". If you want go check it out it's probably still on Netflix. But I felt as though for some reason this was not as good as the believer for the following reason: I felt as though Edward Nortons character was not as explored as I would have liked him to be. I mean they explored a lot about him, but it wasn't enough if you ask me. I think that this was more because the story was just a bunch of flashbacks that occurred over the course of a day and a night. And I guess for some reason the movie felt way too short for that reason. Other than that I quite enjoyed this movie. This movie has a lot of great moments to it and the movie did it's main job: get me to hate the crappy version of the nazis that we have here in america. I felt almost as if this movie was trying to get me to hate those people. And I hated them for a lot of the movie because of the reasons that the nazis in this movie hated everyone. And they hated for unreasonable, mis-informed and just stupid reasons. And that's the reason that most people hate nazis. But then I realized as the movie was over that maybe I'm not supposed to hate these people. Because hatred is a manifestation of anger. And that hatred lead to people being killed. And not just people who had done bad things, but also the people who wanted to make themselves better. If you're into stories of American Neo-Nazis then don't hesitate to watch this. I out it off for far too long. Even though it's not the best it turned out great in the end. And both Edwards were fantastic.",

His dangerous and controversial lifestyle destroys his family and influences his young brother Danny. Eventually, Derek goes to prison for a three year sentence but inside that environment he finds redemption but once he finally gets out he realize that Danny has grown up to become like him thus making Derek\u00b4s objective to redeem his brother and assure his family\u00b4s security.\nWith a pretty dark premise and an incredibly good reputation, you enter this film with high expectations and \"American History X\" does not disappoint at all. \"American History X\" counts with an amazing and ambitious character driven story about the effects of hate on an individual and the terrible influence he may be to the young generation, solid/outstanding performances with the best being, obviously, Edward Norton providing the strongest acting of his entire career to date as a man filled with hatred who\u00b4s looking for redemption; strong /deep character with their own story arcs, a phenomenally made atmosphere, strong visuals, graphic and even hard to watch scenes that have point in the narrative, a perfectly told antiracism message, deep and relatable themes, memorable cinematography, well use of non chronological storytelling, and it will definitely get some sentiment out of you. Despite all those phenomenal elements, I found two problems with \"American History X\": 1) Tony Kaye direction is often heavy-handed thus taking some of the characters internal struggles complexity away. 2) The film\u00b4s runtime limited the potential that Danny\u00b4s story could had achieved by just providing one scene where his arc is completed, I believe that if he not only listened to his brother but also saw the flaws and dangers of his Neo-Nazi lifestyle by himself, it would provided more power to the film\u00b4s appropriate conclusion. \n\"American History X\" is one of the greatest character driven story that I ever seen, while it often is heavy-handed it's still a powerful story that will depress and/or shock people but it will provide an uplifting message at the end.",

The crazy thing that has changed is now there is even more fighting among same race gangs.\n\nThe movie starts out with a bang, and another, and several more, followed by one of the more graphic, repulsive, violent deaths in cinema history.  It shows how hatred can turn people to gangs, and how it rips families apart. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a skin head loving Nazi that goes down as the local gang's hero after a series of killings and jail time.\n\nBut in jail, Vinyard gets is comeupings and then some. He has to worry about rival gangs and just trying to stay alive. After prison life, things are very different yet still complicated for Vinyard and his brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong. You can see the range of Norton's acting through this part of the movie.\n\nThe film is raw and passionate at the same time. You see Derek Vinyard's trail into dissention through many flashbacks throughout the movie. You see what changed him into a neo-Nazi, and then what changed him in prison. He is an anti-hero; you feel sorry for him and want his life to get better. It shows you how life is not black and white, but shades of grey in-between. \n\nThis is a hard hitting movie. It deals with an issue rarely talked about. It is a must see movie, put it in your bucket list if you haven't. And if I was a teacher or parent who lives in a bad neighborhood where gangs run rampant, I would show it to my kids, despite its R rating. Honestly I think it's a must see for any kid once they hit their teens. This movie can be that impactful. I'm sure hope it has detoured some from gang life.",

American History X boasts a perfect balance of horror and humanity, making it one of my favorite movies of the late 90's.\n\nFull Review: http://www.movie-blogger.com/movie-review/intriguing-and-painfully-real",

This is the trick, to get the ignorant racist people to side with the film. Then it begins to show how fucked up he his.

The back and forth in time also works well (especially the black and white imagery). That said, the film is flawed because it comes across a little bit preachy at times (the director desperately wanted his name taken off the film for this reason) and the musical score is way too dramatic at times, making the film very melodramatic.

It's like he's a child who's just discovered a new magic trick.

            "content": "American History X, the film that everyone apparently thinks is one of the most important films of all time, falls into yet another slot on the ever-growing list of movies that I disagree with seemingly everyone on. No, this is not an intrinsically good film. I don't believe that a movie should be awarded points simply because it tackles tough subjects, and I don't think that the subject itself should have any serious weight in the overall opinion of it. If you're a religious person and you watch The Passion of the Christ, you can't say it's a good movie purely based on the fact that it's about something you believe in. The key to good filmmaking is the way the directors, actors, and writers go about portraying the subjects at hand; regardless of who or what the subjects are. And although race relations in America are tense at best, and deserve close examination, that alone does not constitute a good movie.\r\n\r\nAmerican History X is the story of a neo-nazi (Edward Norton) who, after a brief 3-year stint in a prison, becomes reformed and tries to turn his little brother on another path than his own. Okay, already I see problems here. Norton's character went to jail because he killed two black guys in the street. Yes, they were bashing up his truck. However, do we really believe that a known white supremacist could wound a guy, curb-stomp him to death, and then get only three years in jail? I mean, maybe in Florida, but not LA. I'm getting sidetracked. The point is, there are key elements of the plot that make no sense, especially what causes Norton to change (spoilers ahead). After seeing the drastic before and after comparisons between pre-jail and post-jail Norton, the audience is waiting for the one defining and incredible event that turned this hateful person around and onto the path of redemption.\r\n\r\nYeah, long story short, that never happens. Norton's story in jail is extremely disappointing. Firstly, he starts to fall out of favor with his fellow white supremacists when they do drug deals with the Mexicans in the prison. Okay... so he got mad at the white guys for doing business with the brown guys, so now he'll side with the brown guys? No, that doesn't make sense. Then the white supremacists rape him in the showers. So that one experience forever altered his world view and made him a kinder, more accepting, gentler human being? Ridiculous! And the last contributing factor is the fact that he makes friends with a black guy on the inside, leading to the black guys not killing him. Wow, there's so much wrong with this premise. I didn't believe for a second that this hateful, ignorant, and self-righteous piece of shit could go through such an incredible transformation in the span of three years. Spare me that \"people change\" bullshit-- the fact of the matter is that this could never have happened, EVER.\r\n\r\nThe one consistent high point is Norton, who is extremely convincing during the flashbacks to his hateful, bigoted past. There's a dinner table scene that is especially well-scripted and acted, where Norton bares a swastika on his chest to a Jewish dinner guest. Eep. Just gonna go out on a limb and say that those are bad table manners. In all seriousness though, it's difficult to play a character that is this reprehensible (Michael Fassbender knows it), but Norton pulls it off. The problem here is that we are then expected to feel sympathy for this character. Well, forgive me if I'm not so quick to forget the fact that this guy was a white supremacist three years ago. Then there's the dialogue between him and his little brother, which is so bad it sounds like it was ad-libbed right on the spot. It's repetitive, corny, forced, and wholly uninteresting. These are great characters, but they seriously deserved a better movie.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for American History X: 4/10 stars. I really wanted to like this film, but unfortunately it ultimately collapses under the weight of the subjects it's covering without actually providing any real substance. The story is questionable at best, the dialogue is laughable for the most part, and the acting, although good, isn't strong enough to hold up the entire movie. Adding to that is the Requiem For A Dream-style way that this film tells us something we already know: Here, instead of \"drugs are bad,\" it's \"racism is bad.\" It tries to have a new take on the subject by trying to make its main character sympathetic... but if the best you can do is try to make me become emotionally attached to a nazi, then I'll gladly take genericness instead.",

            "content": "American History X is the greatest film since Romper Stomper to deal directly with the neo-Nazi movement, and in a similar manner it does it in the most powerful way: through depicting the savage brutality of the movement.\nAmerican History X is one of the most savagely brutal crime dramas to ever be so small scaled and devoted to its characters while understanding the wider world beyond him, as in how his beliefs and actions prove to impact on the people around him. And through a strong screenplay, intense direction, amazing acting and powerful visuals, American History X succeeds in every area.\nLike I said, American History X gets its brutal story dynamics up close and personal with the viewers by shocking them with it. And its all shot perfectly and stylishly so that the hauntingly intense atmosphere manages to thrill viewers with its feel and its look. All the dramatics are shot well with fine cinematography and edited perfectly, even getting a little more intense thanks to the touch of the musical score.\nThe musical score in American History X is immensely beautiful and helps the emotional drama of the story move along as it explores all the complicated territory that David McKenna writes into it.\nReally, American History X is a very complicated film which has a story that touches on dark territory but never crosses the line no matter how hard it pushes. And the screenplay treats the characters well because its so brutally honest with how they speak and think that the product is almost unbearable for viewers. But those who can bear and appreciate it will be amazed by the true quality of American History X. I know I was.\nAmerican History X is an unforgettable film as an intense visual experience and an emotional one, and thanks to the direction of Tony Kaye, it never falls short of its potential or downgrades its utter brutality.\nBut the standout quality is the acting which isn't just amazing, its immaculate.\nEdward Norton's performance is savagely unforgettable. After playing the simultaneously villainous and fragile Aaron Stampler in Primal Fear, he steps up into the almost impossibly intimidating role of violent and sadistic neo-Nazi Derek Vinyard in American History X and gives a performance so powerful and so intimidating that I would be lying if I said it didn't leave me physically shaking. The utter brutality Edward Norton puts into characterising Derek Vinyard's absolute hate for Asians, Blacks and Jews is incredibly poweruful and combined with his muscular stature and the stare in his eyes that pierce the screen as if they see straight into hell makes it the greatest performance of his career. Its easy to play a person that turns into a villain, but its much more difficult to play someone going the other way, particularly one that is covered in violent muscles and neo-Nazi tattoo's. And yet Edward Norton proves how to do it. While the film itself does assist the development by having an emotional atmosphere which is constantly changing, all the responsibility rests on Edward Norton's shoulders as he carries the story through all of its dramatic territory with an immensely powerful and unflinching dramatic lead role. Edward Norton truly is an incredible actor, and his name should be more popular today than many others. Even though he lost the Academy Award for Best Actor to Roberto Benigni for La Vita E Bella (Life is Beautiful) who gave what I deem to be the single greatest performance in cinematic history, he still gave an unforgettable performance packed to the brim with talent that cannot be taught and only comes from deep within the heart of a truly passionate actor.\n\nAnd teamed up with him is the talented young Edward Furlong, the actor famous for his dead-on performance as John Connor in Terminator 2: Judgement Day, the film has a real connection of brotherly chemistry to it to enhance its quality and give it a more powerful impact. And thanks to the efforts of Edward Furlong its successful in that area because he has a powerful confidence to him as an actor which he instils into the role of Danny Vinyard and gives the story a good supporting character to assist in characterising the main character Derek Vinyard. He constantly is a figure of interest and the performance of Edward Furlong is dead on in capturing the emotional drama of the role. His line delivery is fierce and the stare in his eye is damaging, but what is perfect is his physicality which enhances the idea that he is the brother of Derek Vinyard by giving him a sense of intimidation. His gritty physical shell and dramatic depth make him a great cast member in American History X and makes me wonder where his career has gone.\nBeverly D'Angelo gives the strongest dramatic performance of her career in American History X. While she's memorable for her comedic work in the National Lampoon's Vacation series of films, she makes more of an impact for her role in American History X. She shows what makes her a great actress. Its her talent for building a dramatic atmosphere in what she is saying gradually until in one big burst she lets it all out in an explosion of climactic drama. It's incredibly impressive that she, the woman who portrayed Ellen Griswold, is actually the woman playing the mother of a sadistic neo-Nazi and doing it so well with such a passion for the drama in the story. She really is a great actress in American History X, and up until now I've only seen her as a good actress.\nGuy Torry also manages to do a good job due to his consistency as an actor with strong line delivery.\n\nSo American History X is a brutal and overpoweringly incredible drama film which displays the greatest talents of actors Edward Norton and Beverly D'Angelo as well as handling its tricky and dark subject matter so well.",

It seems to say that education can change an evil man into a good one, but educating one man at a time is a slow process and we may be running out of time.\n\nAfter the death of their father, brothers Derek (Edward Norton) and Danny (Edward Furlong) fall under the sway of a radical white supremacist. Derek becomes an obscenity-spewing leader of a white gang that trashes immigrant-run corner stores and chases black neighbours out of local parks. He eventually goes too far and ends up in prison for a vicious, brutal murder. While he is out of sight, his legend grows among the skinhead crowd and younger brother Danny goes along with the vitriol (although there are some indications that Danny doesn't totally buy into the Aryan ideology). Finally, Derek is released a changed man and does his best to save Danny from the cycle of hate and violence.\n\nThe movie is told through a combination of present-day scenes after Derek's release and flashbacks (filmed in crystal-clear black and white) of the murder and Derek's time in prison, where we see how he comes to recognize the white supremacists' preaching to be utterly false.\n\nThis is a difficult and disturbing film to watch. I watched it with a high-school teacher whose students repeatedly tell her how awesome it is. Clearly, some teenagers are completely missing the point, which is always a danger when presenting such hate-filled behaviour in a realistic way. The weak-minded will see it as glorifying a point of view that in fact it is showing as utterly abhorrent.\n\nThis film presents a view of a life that middle-class viewers like me have never experienced and I hope never will. I know these attitudes and actions exist, but I don't really know what purpose is served by putting them on the screen.",

I'm tired of stories about race revolving around how white people suffer as a result of being racist, instead of how black people suffer as a result of racism. \n\nThe story is ok, I'm just surprised it was so fundamentally focused on Derek's humanity, to the point where his murder of two black men doesn't seem as bad by the end because the viewers sympathize with him. Conversely, we know absolutely nothing about the boy who kills Danny. We don't know why he killed and the story doesn't even bother to complicate his life (ex:showing him taking care of his sick mother, or how he got to be in a gang). He therefore becomes dehumanized and villainous. I think every character in the story deserves more exploration and the fact that so many amazing stories are brushed over just makes the whole viewing experience frustrating",

We follow a modern Nazi Derek Vonyard through his journey from modern nazi with a deep hatred towards all black people, to a man fighting for equality and redemption for himself. \n\nThe acting is absolutely brilliant in the film, with a powerhouse performance from Edward Norton. I still stand by my opinion that this is his undeniably finest performance of his career as of yet. Edward Furlong also does what many would consider his last good performance until the inevitable consequences of youth-stardom hit him hard.\n\nAlthough at first viewing one could easily say that the movie relies solely on its shock-value at the end to make it so great, but there is a deeper message. It tells us about how your actions may have consequences, not only for you, but for those around you as well. It also tells us how you simply cannot escape your past without cost. \n\nAmerican History X contains a lot of powerful scenes that actually makes Derek sound as a reasonable man with valid points to confirm his own prejudice. Even though we all know what he says is wrong, one cannot deny that he has a somewhat legitimate point. But like I said already, the consequences can and will be severe.\n\nAmerican History X is a surprisingly powerful movie about prejudice and how it may scar you and your loved ones for life, and how your former misdeeds can rub off on others.",

            "content": "American History X is about the idea that prejudice and bigotry will kill our children. The idea is that prejudice is a slippery slope. A father's offhanded racist remark over the dinner can lead to unintended consequences. The result, in the world of this movie, is children killing each other. The movie makes a pretty convincing argument that the consequences in our world would be just as dire, that there is no room for even a little bit of bigotry in our society if we are to survive without killing each other.\n\nAmerican History X goes about proving this idea with two main plots: the internal plot of Derek's redemption from being a skinhead Nazi to a tolerant individual actively helping the good cause and the external plot of Derek's attempt to save his younger brother Danny from the brainwashing that ruined him. Derek is successful in redeeming himself, but his attempt to save Danny fails when Danny is shot and killed. This suggests that even if we live with hate in a momentary weakness, that hate will have consequences far beyond the moment. The movie suggests that with hate, there is no such thing as true redemption. Therefore, we are all well-advised to avoid even a little bit of it.\n\nThe movie makes the idea fully believable because of the depths of hate and true redemption Derek goes through. He seemed to have finally won the battle to save both his family's soul when his past all of a sudden catches up to him and kills Danny. This twist at the end makes it impossible to finish the movie feeling good about ourselves that the hero has won his redemption through his trials by fire. It makes it impossible not to think and feel and believe that hate will eventually catch up to all of us if we let it in for even a little bit. Great idea and a great movie.\n\nMy Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",

            "content": "Tony Kaye delivers a masterful directorial debut with his film American History X which delves into dark territory. American History X, for me, was quite difficult to watch. In a world where race equality was always stressed in my surroundings, it truly hit me like a ton of bricks seeing the white supremacist Neo-Nazi movements in American History X. It takes a lot to get to me when it comes to dramatic films, and Kaye had me from the moment the opening credits rolled. The use of black and white cinematography to differentiate between past and present experiences was truly something unexpected for a film about Neo-Nazi movements. Nevertheless, Kaye's motif of black and white filming style showed how the world that he was showing was nothing short of black and white in the eyes of Derek Vinyard. Flashing to the present moments of the movie, after Derek was released from his three-year sentence in federal prison for voluntary manslaughter, we see the colored cinematography seeing that black and white have blended together as one and that a world of color has opened to Derek's eyes just through a simple change of color. A subtle, but brilliant direction choice from a novice director is something that is nice to see! Now, I must mention the sensational Academy Award nominated performance of the spine-chilling Edward Norton (Primal Fear, The Illusionist, Fight Club). Norton's raw performance is the natural highlight of the movie. The clash Norton shows between the reformed and the flawed Derek Vinyard just through his actions is nothing short of a masterful actor in his key environment. Be this as it may, I cannot overshadow the supporting performances of Edward Furlong and Beverley D'Angelo. Furlong's performance of Danny Vinyard shows the necessity to impress a brother through actions not words. Though this ultimately can be construed as Danny's tragic flaw, we see Furlong ace this part in spades. D'Angelo's raw performance as a flawed, ill mother attempting to break through to her two sons breaks your heart during a confrontational scene between Derek and his mother at Derek's prison. Exploring motifs of race, gangs, race riots, prison, rape, antisemitism, and Neo-Nazi movements, American History X delves into uncharted territory for a film from the late 1990's, and shines as an ideal history lesson to the negative sections that darken  American History.",

How much racism and discrimination can one put into a movie before its message becomes lost? I can't be sure on that, but American History X finds a silver lining while flawed gets across its positive message.\r\n\r\nAmerican History X is about a former neo-nazi skinhead trying to prevent his younger brother from going down the same wrong path that he did. The main character are white supremacists which limits the audiences in terms in how much we can relate to them. What is universally relatable is the protagonist idea of hate. While not on the same level as the protagonists we all have been hated or hated someone whether for petty or good reasoning behind it. The most powerful element of the plot is its protagonist. Seeing his transformation and development into a different person is powerfully symbolic. It feels natural, realistic, and even inspiring to have an entirely new perspective on race and life.\r\n\r\nA major complaint on the plot is the younger brother not being as developed. All we know is that he took influence from his older brother behavior and is having trouble at school. He felt secondary despite narrating the story and being a huge focused in the beginning of the film. As for the ending of the film it is shocking not for the right reason. It got acrossed its anti racist message boldly, but at the cost of any emotional resonate with that character.\r\n\r\nAlso in the film whenever a problem occurred when black people were present they would start trouble. The opening scene, a dispute in a basketball game, the scene where Danny Vinyard confronts Little Henry in the restroom, and the ending. It's seemed more than just coincidence, but given the nature of the characters one can't really call it discriminative. It is a major part of Norton and Furlong characters to be racist and these encounters better help illustrate the transformations. Not a major flaw, but one odd observation when viewing that difficult to look past.  \r\n\r\nOf course no review of this film would be complete without mentioning Edward Norton. He's simply at top form here. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. It not just balancing the range of his character, but the dimension of his life. Changing himself psychologically, socially, and politically in natural form to make the root of the film works. It is Edward Norton film and it's because his performance that the film works as great as it does.\r\n\r\nAmerican History X perfectly balances walking a thin line of tackling racism true to nature without ever becoming just a film piece to simply be offensive. It themes are universal, the performance by Edward Norton is easily his best, and overall a great movie with a positive to boost.",

Edward Norton's Oscar-nominated role as the pissed-off-Nazi-loving-skinhead-turned-to-good-boy is simply amazing. I guess that is what made me like this fiilm very much. Change. And a hell lot of racist commentaries and conflicts and some hard-ass copulation (feeling obliged not to write the 'F' word here). It's basically a tale of how this one youth, Derek, affected by the death of his father who died in the hands of a Negro, turns into a Skinhead and becomes extremely racist. Soon his brother, Danny wishes to follow in his brother's footsteps just when Derek is sent to jail. It is from then on that Derek wishes for his brother to turn away from it all. It's quite a good morality story, I will have to say. \n\nOn the technical side, Anne Dudley has also provided a wonderful score for this movie as well. Honestly, I was half-expecting mostly heavy metal, punk, hard rock sort of soundtrack, something which I would usually hear from most skinhead movies, but instead, I got well-written orchestral music bursting from the speakers as the images played by. The cinematography is okay, using black & white mode to depict events from the past and colours for those in the present time. The screenplay is also well-done, inserting small bits of simple everyday humour effectively into the dialogues. The plot may have been quite predictable, but the film makes one fall in love with the characters so much (especially Edward Furlong's and Edward Norton's characters) so much so that, even if one were to have foreseen what was coming in the end, one would still feel emotionally affected by it. At least, I was. \n\nOverall, this is an excellent film which has a good story coupled with high production value. It will definitely be one of my top 5 favourite films of all time.",

            "content": "I kept thinking throughout the film that I was watching a Spike Lee film, I knew I wasn't, but I could see him doing something like this but then again, you look at Lee's '25th Hour', and of course it has no relation, but comically, it looks like everything has fallen into place. Regardless of that, 'American History X' is a powerful film with top-notch performances from a fantastic cast.\n\nGiven the way the story unfolds I would have expected this to be based on a book and the way the film opens effectively sets the mood really well and the film is gritty and real. I like the use of Black and White for the flashbacks and colour for the present day, even if I originally thought the film would be all in Black and White given that the only promotional images of the film I saw were in Black and White. I originally wanted more Black and White footage but it worked just using it for the flashbacks and the longer the film goes on the more flashbacks we see. While some might have a problem with the fact that film is told in this way, I liked the non-linear approach with the continued revealing of events that happened earlier in the film and to have more context is always good. It also uses slow-mo at times but it fits for where it is needed. It is a smart film and is executed perfectly; the title is smart as well. Like I said, the performances in this film are fantastic and everyone does an excellent job in a very well chosen cast. Edward Norton is such a fantastic actor and he did so much great work right from the beginning of his career, it's phenomenal, his range of emotions is fantastic and he received a very well earned Oscar nomination. It's crazy to see how long it was until he got another nomination, and even for this role he got snubbed quite a lot.\n\nI do think the script does have some issues though, I think Danny's transformation over the night seemed to happen unrealistically quickly. I know he was being told a very raw story by his brother but if you've been brought up to believe a certain thing your whole life, I don't think the transition would happen so suddenly like that. He might understand where his brother was coming from and I understand the message but the internal conflict would be huge. Perhaps it was because he didn't truly believe that lifestyle that it happened so quickly. I also thought every time that Danny was doing a voiceover he was writing more of his essay, but he wasn't, however, I did like how his story about writing the essay ended with him staying up the whole night. I know it was written into the plot that the skinheads in the prison were hypocrites but they just didn't make any sense, they tell Derek to stop preaching but then accuse of him of not being good to the cause and yeah, right, like he would sit with them after what happened in the shower, which was a very brutal scene. However, despite being hard criminals in jail, one of them still raises their finger when they drink. I also found the black jelly bean being amongst the white ones to be a bit silly, especially given the abundance of white ones, I know SVEN was a skinhead as well but come on and when he spat them out they were all different colours anyway. And would they really be filming a robbery? Maybe to look at and laugh later but imagine if that was found as evidence.\n\n'American History X' is an important, powerful and very memorable film and a very smart one too; it is lead by strong directing and performances and has a very poignant message. It certainly seems like something that would have gained more award attention but I guess it was too raw for them. And it is another film off of the list.",

It might have also been that after watching this dude kill someone with a curb stomp and smile in satisfaction, I was expecting at least to see him rot in jail. But I know that wasn't the point, and I really, really liked this movie. It is flawed but well intentioned. Race hatred is a very sensitive subject to work with, and still the film manages to leave a thought-provoking impression on how racism is one of the most dangerous, destructive ideas out there. And on what an incredibly crucial factor nurture is. Edward Norton's performance was particularly powerful, mostly in the first half of the film: that skinhead nut was so unlike what seems to be his usually mellow self. He deserved the nomination.
