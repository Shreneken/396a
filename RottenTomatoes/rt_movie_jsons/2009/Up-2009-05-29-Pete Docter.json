This was straight evil.\n\ni like at the begining of the film mr fredrickson felt like a fragile old man at deaths door, but throughout the film we see he still has a lot of nrg and at the end we see he still has alot to live for and is vey mobile \n\noverall i loved this film",

And if it doesn't rank with Pixar's very best, at least they're still the leaders in superior family films. Ed Asner brings grumpy warmth to the main character. Jordan Nagai is cute. Both find the pathos with ease. Within the first 10 minutes the film has cast its spell on us. A dialogue-free montage of a life-long love affair is the film's most beautiful and spellbinding moment. The action is exciting and fun, especially in the third act. Director Pete Docter did 'Monsters, Inc.' so he knows something about making a lighthearted farce for families. It's playing in some theaters in 3D, but do yourself a favor and see it in 2D. The 3D effects are few and far between, and you'll be able to appreciate the textures of the environments much more. Plus the color pallet is downright gorgeous, and the 3D only dulls them. But no matter how you see it, at least you'll be watching one of the best films of the summer",

            "content": "I love Pixar and feel they have been pretty consistent. True I do prefer Toy Story over Cars and Finding Nemo over Ratatouille, but I find their films amazingly animated and thrilling. I thought that after the first two Toy Story films, that Pixar wouldn't be able to make a film to top them. WALL-E, yes I loved it, came pretty close, but in my opinion Up is Pixar's masterwork. And why do I say that? Because it is widely imaginative and astonishing in its emotional range.\n\nFirst of all, the animation is stupendous, beautiful backgrounds, beautifully drawn characters and stunning colours. The scenery and sights are just fantastic, down to the colour and visual detail that went into the film. Michael Giacchino's music is stunning as well, simple yet melodious and sublime. And I do have to concur with the majority about the opening montage; Finding Nemo had some beautiful moments and WALL-E's haunting isolation moved me close to tears but this opening montage was so poignant and utterly heart-breaking. It is quite simply one of the most beautiful and effective beginnings ever to an animated film.\n\nI have heard complaints that the story meanders when the talking dogs are introduced and that they were irritating. Can I respectfully disagree? What I loved about Up was how widely imaginative it was, in short why shouldn't a dog talk? It's an animated film, why does it have to COMPLETELY realistic? Elephants don't fly, look at what Disney did with Dumbo.The story, back on target was well written, thrilling and startling with a sense of adventure with enough action and high-flying escapism for kids and adults. The script had some truly hilarious and surreal moments, while Toy Story had wonderful sophisticated dialogue, the dialogue in Up made me laugh and it made me cry.\n\nAnd finally the characters, I loved them all, grumpy old widower Carl, stowaway Russell, eccentric adventurer Charles Muntz, the big bird and the hilarious Doug. Russell may be a tad annoying at first, but he grows on you. The voice acting is exceptional- Carl is voiced with real demeanour and depth by Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer, the wonderful underrated actor he is, is superb as Charles Muntz. But I do have to give mention to Bob Peterson, he is simply brilliant as Doug, he is really funny when he needs to be and never overdoes it.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful film. There may be controversy over how Beauty and the Beast is no longer the only animated film to be nominated for best picture. Beauty and the Beast has been and always will be my favourite animated film and one of my favourite films of all time (The Lion King is a very close second), but Up is a great film and does deserve an award of some kind. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

That is why this magnificent explorer is regarded as a well-known figure who inspires adoration and a desire to emulate his exploits. Ellie and Carl see everything he has to offer if they follow in his footsteps by following their dreams.\n\nThere are additional metaphors in the film, such as when Carl is looking through Ellie's adventure album and notices that she has filled it with images of their lives together; that is to say, life is truly an adventure that they can make, and the adventure album represented her most memorable adventure. This causes us to believe that we should savor and take advantage of every minute of our existence.\n\nCarl learns a valuable lesson after conquering all hurdles and attaining his goal: respect the things and people that are around him and leave behind everything that has previously occurred; he learns not to cling to his past and enjoy the present.\n\nIn conclusion, the film's message is that it is very easy to overlook the things we own or the people we live with, and it is only until we no longer have them or they leave our side that we realize how valuable they are. Just as it happened in the scene where the strings of the balloons were being cut, causing the house to go down in level, the turbulence in our lives can cause us to lose these precious balloons that lift us up and take us to our goals. \n\nFurthermore, it teaches us that coexistence and human connections are important aspects of our lives, that everything has its time, and that it is preferable to let things go when we know they are not meant to be.\n\nIn short, the movie aims to convey a moral: time passes. From there, the entire plot develops, culminating in an adorable journey in which Carl attempts to make a dream come true.",

The emotions are so much present that I was living all the feelings on earth in only 1h35. Pixar did a PHENOMENAL job on this.

However, even though it is better, it doesn't affect the quality of the entire film, at least for me. I just wanted to say that because Up has that problem too, but it definitely hurts the quality of everything else the movie has to offer. The first 10 minutes: the best thing Pixar has ever animated up to this point, without a doubt. Carl and Ellie's love story is just amazing, and if it doesn't make you cry, then you don't have a soul, that's just how it works. ANYWAY, the rest of the movie is either only good or watchable to me. The villain is good, but he's no Syndrome or Randall. The setting is nice, but WALL-E felt more atmospheric than this. Expect for Doug, I actually don't find Russell or Kevin as charming as I originally thought. I think all those problems make Up Pixar's most overrated film by a good bit for me. With all of that said, this movie is still a good movie. If you can't find anything charming in this movie, I'd be shocked. This is a Pixar movie everyone else thinks is great, but I only see it as pretty good. Obviously, it is still worth the watch. Go to Disney+ to gather your own opinion on this sky high flick!",

The beginning of the movie is a beautiful and heartwarming start. There's very few dialogue but you don't need it. Everything is told by just through emotion and you really do feel that. You're aloud to be in their world more and you are aloud to just be in awe of the gorgeous animation. However when the movie gets done with it's first act, the movie actually m does pretty well with their characters. I love the relationship between Carl and Russel and I also really like the bird, and the dog that they kept. However the one thing that I actually really like is the villain. I really like how he's so obsessed with finding this bird and would do anything to claim that he's the one who found it. However the one problem that I have with this movie is that it is kinda hard for me to believe that when you have so many balloons to lift your own house up, but the movie is so clever in so many other areas that you could forgive it ab that could be considered a nitpick. Other than that I enjoyed this movie this movie is close to perfect but again the aspect of the flying house of balloons is kinda weird and mostly almost hard to buy into but as I said earlier the movie is so clever in so many other ways that you could honestly not really care.

It share a really fun adventure with a sad old man whos wife died, and a young boy with a dream of becoming a real bot scout. The only reason why I did not give this a five star review is only because I am an adult, and i would rather watch stuff directed at my age, but for your kids I am sur thy would give it a grand five stars.",

In my opinion, the rest of the film is really good. Even though the concept of the story is not super engaging, the pacing is unique yet effective in how they set up the villain and conflict. I also like the characters. Carl and Russel are great and Dug is such a cute and fun character. Alpha is really funny as well. The villain's motivation is surprisingly strong and the final battle is actually hilarious. So few compete with it, though I think the one in Monsters Inc. puts up a fight. Wit that in mind, I think I slightly prefer Monsters Inc. Both are cute, fun movies with strong characters and relationships, but Monsters Inc. handles characters a bit better. On other thing to note is that the score is Pixar's best hands down (until Soul inevitably takes its crown). Overall, this film really holds up. I didn't like it as a kid, but that was because I didn't like emotional stuff. This film is funny, charming, pretty, sometimes emotional, and certainly entertaining. It is far from Pixar's best, but it's in their top half. Definitely worth a watch, even if the opening is a bit overrated.",

Pete Docter and Bob Peterson's story about an old man who only wishes to keep his promise to his deceased wife is deeply emotionally resonant. His writing is emotionally stirring and charmingly funny. Up is an original adventure film with similarities to *batteries not included, The Pokemon Movie, Indiana Jones, Gerald's Game, and Grumpy Old Men. It's such a cute and devastating movie with an appreciation for your loved ones and the spirit of adventure! Doctor's direction is fast and fun with a serene tone for 96 minutes.\n\n Katherine Ringgold and Kevin Nolting's editing is brisk with beautiful montages and gentle cuts for a seamless viewing experience. Up's legendary opening 15 minutes is a triumph of filmmaking and visual expression telling an old man's tragic tale in one fell swoop. Patrick Lin and Jean-Claude Kalache's cinematography features striking wide shots and adorably framed close-ups to pull at your heart strings. Michael Giacchino's lovely soft piano score will do the rest. I love his use of a repeating melody throughout Up as a reminder of the opening sequence of Carl and Ellie growing up and old together.\n\nEd Asner's grumpy old man voice is perfect for Carl. Christopher Plummer adds a sense of awe and gravitas as the explorer Charles Muntz. Jordan Nagai is crazy as the persistent boy scout Russell. Pete Docter cameos as the voice of the Campmaster at the end, while writer and co-director Bob Peterson cameos as the lovable, loyal dog Doug. John Ratzenberger cameos as the voice of the cheery construction worker, while Elie Docter voices the sincere Ellie. Delroy Lindo even cameos as the voice of the dog Beta.\n\nIn all, I recommend Up for any families as the adults will appreciate all the life advice and experience, while the children will like the funny old man, talking dog, and silly bird for sure.",

            "content": "The five brains of Docter, Stanton, Lasseter, Peterson & McCarthy, put out yet another heartfelt and moving, family-fun adventure film! They incorporated a lot of emotional notes, with some great laughs! The first act is the best first act Pixar has ever put out! It gets the audience connected and invested so fast, by using detailed flashbacks to set up a sentimental montage; making us truly care for our main protagonist, Carl Fredrickson.\n\nCarl Fredrickson, voiced by Ed Asner, had the most pronounced character arch, being a character you truly cared about the whole time, despite his negative attitude half of the time. He brings a lot of mature wit to the film, dishing out the harsh truth at times. Russell, voiced by Jordan Nasgai is a loud, yet optimistic & charming character, that had great merit. He may have gotten to be a tad annoying as the film proceeds, but he is a fantastic addition to Carl. Charles F. Muntz, voiced by Christopher Plummer, is our main antagonist. He really wasn't anything special, or unpredictable; he just served his purpose at a surface level. Dug, voiced by Bob Peterson was nothing but a fury enjoyment at first, but ended up having great character development, and a respectable place in the film. Kevin is just one of those animals, Pixar continues to throw into films, that they try to make important. Kevin was better than most animal additions, but I didn't truly care for his reason, or his character at all.\n\nThe cinematography and animation created this very vibrant and colorful film. The animations were beautifully detailed, along side the breathtaking backdrops and scenery.\n\nAlthough Up has a lot of entertaining moments, it doesn't come without a few bumps in the road. Even though the opening act is one of the best we've seen from Pixar, it's really hard to keep that pace up for the whole run time. Up does it's best to do just that, but does slack in some areas. With Pixar, they create these mental obstacles that you need to be able to overlook, and in Up's case, it has a few easy nitpicks. I had no problems overlooking some obstacles, but they incorporated a lot of stretched out abilities, with the leeway they were already granted. Another strange thing they did was create a few counteracting tones, trying to be poignant at some points, but silly throughout most of the film.\n\nOverall, Up is one of Pixar's finest, and belongs in the top ten!",

After the extremely touching opening sets the bar high out the gate, the film devolves into the cute, packaged shenanigans tailor-made to amuse only a child audience. It forgets the actual jokes. Just because it's syrupy cute, doesn't make it funny. Admittedly, ‘Up’ is still better than the rudimentary junk that other animation studios churn out, but it's less of a hit by Pixar's standards; for the first time, the fantasy element is more implausibly distracting than imaginative fun. And *SPOILER* to actually kill the villain seemed quite out of place considering all the fluffy peril that led up to the climax.",

In this case, of course, it's a cute little airborne house, suspended from a mass of festively-colored helium balloons on a sort of farewell voyage to South America.\n\nThe filmmakers don't dwell on the science of this and neither do we. It's just too much fun to second-guess, a slice of childhood imagination come to life, which fits Up's warm narrative like a cozy winter glove. That sense of freshly-rediscovered adventure, a renewed link to the open-minded optimism of our earliest memories, that's what drives the plot and binds us to the cast. Right from the picture-perfect opening scene, arguably the best dialog-free montage ever, it's got us locked in for the long haul. Even when the second act sprawls, threatening to devolve into a broad adventure tale, trailing a long tail of recurring gags, we're thrown a thematic bone to keep it all together, neat and tidy.\n\nThe traditional climax may feel just a hair on the flat side - the villain dispensed in a manner befitting a James Bond evildoer - but the story's real apex arrives just before the closing credits, when the preceding ninety minutes of small details and callbacks finally pay off in a rich, appropriate farewell.",

Evidence: the kid barely catches the house by the nozzle of the garden hose and then in the next scene has the hose tied around his waist in order to pull the house around with him while they are on the ground and the house is still in the sky. So he must've pulled the house at least about ten feet closer to him to do this. Was the kid too stupid to simply pull the house all the way down so they could board it again? I hope not.

The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect.

            "content": "This is possibly one of the greatest animated films of all time as it tells an emotionally moving story with sincerity while including humor that appeals to both children and adults. The focus of the film is not how it looks, although it does look beautiful, or how many silly pop cultural references they can include, it's one of the best made films of 2009 because it connects with audience members. The opening montage brings tears to anybody's eyes and I was no exception because I completely fell for the film's sentimental portrait of what long lasting love can bring to a person's life. This is absolutely a must watch film because it proves that animated films made for an audience of children can be deeper than the prestige dramas that the Weinstein era provided us with like The Reader (2008) and The Cider House Rules (1999).\n\nOrnery old man Carl Fredrickson, Ed Asner, is traumatized by the death of his beloved wife Ellie with whom he planned to visit Paradise Falls and meet childhood hero Charles F. Muntz, Christopher Plummer. He decides that he will travel there by turning house into an air balloon after he is legally forced to move to a retirement home. His plans are interrupted when eager boy scout Russell, Jordan Nagai, decides to join him on his trip. The two come into conflict during their travels but they are able to band together and ultimately bond as they face great adversity. \n\nThe opening scene is so touching because we see the simple comforts of marriage and growing old with the person you love. We don't just see the big moments but we also get to watch the two hold hands while reading books or watch clouds and have a picnic. The scenes of devastation are surprisingly horrifying as I was shocked at how much I cared about Ellie's miscarriage and the efforts they made to get to Paradise Falls. Marriage doesn't often get portrayed positively on screen as so often we get the Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) style histrionics but this film is invested in the life of it's main character and showing us how he became old and bitter after losing the woman who was the center of his world.\n\nThe scenes of him bonding with his surrogate son figure are also moving because we are aware that he lost the chance to have his own child and his efforts are now less concerted because he has lost the woman who would have raised the child with him. We get sweet scenes of the buoyant, excited Russell being completely unfazed by the anger of a cranky old man. The comedic gags work too as the film is only ninety minutes long and the sight of an exuberant young man flitting around an enclosed space while our central character evokes Archie Bunker draws out some real laughter. This is a film that captures your heart and leaves you feeling cheery and that's something surprisingly hard to find in modern films.\n\nThe director deserves credit for how well he manages to tell a simple story as many children's films with this slight of a plot run excessively long or don't pack the emotional punch that this film does. If it were up to me I would have nominated Pete Docter for Best Director because I think he tells an emotional story far more compellingly than Precious (2009) does. The visual look of the film is also impressive because it has that gorgeous primary color palette that most Pixar films have and the characters are all very expressive and lifelike. Reading that the character of Carl was based on Spencer Tracy towards the end of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), which I watched recently, warmed my heart and of course it was nice to see an Asian-American character represented in a major studio film.\n\nThere was really no competition this year in terms of the Best Animated Feature lineup because this film is easily better than Coraline (2009), Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), The Princess and the Frog (2009) and The Secrets of Kells (2009). Thank goodness animated films have become so sophisticated in this era.",

            "content": "Up\nSince its release in 2009, Up has stood as a beautifully animated adventure film that holds its ground against Pixar's best. Up's premise of an old man following his dreams in a balloon-propelled home is children's animation gold; yet, it's so much more than a simple children's movie. Through heavy hitting emotional sequences and compelling visual storytelling, Up conveys a powerful message about building relationships when recovering from tragedy. Though its simple narrative doesn't always resonate with the central theme, this film beautifully weaves together imaginative adventure and grounded personal conflict into a timeless masterpiece. \n\tThe brain child of directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, Up's surface features are flawless. Its visually stunning animation still holds up in current times. Michael Giacchino's expertly composed score adds a light, adventurous tone to the narrative. However, what takes Up above and beyond the Pixar Standard is the voice acting. Pixar has shown countless times the incredible stories they can convey with visuals alone, but Up crafts its narrative around Ed Asner and his phenomenal voice acting. Ed Asner, best known for his character Lou Grant on the Mary Tyler Moore Show, plays the old man Carl Fredricksen. Over the course of the film, Carl experiences the full gauntlet of emotions; tragedy, joy, youthfulness, regret, anger, love. Conveying such a complex character with merely a voice would challenge any accomplished voice actor, but Anser makes it look easy, stealing the show with his lively, emotional, realistic depiction of Carl.\nThe movie's open shots depict Carl as a shy, mild boy entranced with thoughts of exploring the unknown. He stumbles across Ellie, a loud, high-dreams, take-the-wheels personality that foils Carl's quiet, reserved demeanor. They quickly become friends, Ellie sharing her dreams to explore the jungles of South America and experience the majesty of Paradise Falls. \n\tThe wordless montage that follows is some of the strongest storytelling put to animation. As friendship turns to love, a married Carl and Ellie go through the life's ups and down. Through a miscarriage, injuries, and other disasters, the couple finds ways to move on together. Spending their time at a local zoo, the couple pursue their childhood dream of visiting the South American Paradise Falls. As the years fly by and they grow old, we see their devotion to each other only grow stronger. \nTragically, right before making the trip to South America, the montage concludes with Ellie passing away. Carl Fredrickson barely copes, calcifying his soft and quiet demeanor in a gruff, unpersonable shell. Spending years in isolation, Carl projects Ellie onto the objects they once shared: the chairs they sat in, her portrait on the wall, the mailbox they built together, the house where they spent their days. Carl's unhealthy mental state becomes apparent after he clashes with a urban construction worker attempting to move his mailbox. It's clear that Carl's defense for the mailbox could easily have been a defense of Ellie herself. Without people to help him cope, his outlash was inevitable and serves as a poignant lesson about the dangers of isolation after personal trauma.\nWith an impending conviction and his world ready to come crashing down, Carl decides to pay last tribute to Ellie by navigating his home to Paradise Falls uplifted by thousands of multicolored, plastic balloons. Though Carl has every intention to journey alone, this proves impossible as Carl is unwillingly beset by three unlikely companions. Immediately after lifting off, Carl discover a terrified Russell (Jason Nagai), a chubby, enthusiastic Wilderness Adventure Scout, clinging to life on Carl's porch. When harsh storms force Carl and Russell to escort the floating house on foot, they encounter Kevin, an impossibly vibrant, flightless bird. Soon after, they encounter Dug, a golden retriever whose every thought is voiced by a metallic collar (in writer Bob Peterson's voice, no less).\nAs the journey to Paradise Falls brings new relationships for Carl, the audience slowly sees Carl's gruffness melt away, exposing his former, lovable self. Yet, this second act windup falls flat in comparison to the powerful, emotional storytelling of the first act. The narrative's exceptional beginning, as well as the conclusion, outshine the body of the film, making it feel as if the middle only exists as a lackluster bridge between the two superior narrative segments. This isn't to say that it doesn't provide value to the film. Each member of the small band journeying to Paradise Falls is suffering from an inner, unshared emptiness: Carl is struggling with the death of his wife; Russell is trying to cope with parental separation and conflict; Dug is a social outcast in his pack; Kevin desperately wants to return to her vulnerable young. Their union helps them each begin healing. \nAnother reason I have mixed feelings about the second act is because of the way the villain is introduced. During the journey, Carl meets his impossibly old childhood hero, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). After spending an evening dining in the exploring legend's dirigible, he realizes that Charles is obsessed with capturing Kevin to regain credibility in the outside world. On the surface, Charles' role in the film seems weak. He only exists to progress Carl's character arc. Yet, upon further inspection, Muntz's importance lies in his similarities with Carl. Both can't move on from their psychologically isolated worlds. Charles' reckless and impossible pursuit of the unattainable bird Kevin is a sobering lesson for Carl and an allegory to the futility of pursuing our own unrealistic expectations. \nWhen Charles realizes that Carl is harboring Kevin, his friendliness immediately turns to mercilessness. As Charles hunts down Carl, Kevin, and the others, the pursuit comes to a head when Charles sets Carl's house aflame. Carl, forced to choose between saving his new friend Kevin or losing his last tie to Ellie, abandons his friends to protect his home, allowing Charles to sweep in and abduct Kevin.\nWith his new friends gone, Carl finishes his journey to the edge of Paradise Falls. As he rests, he can't shake off his loneliness. He leafs through Ellie's old scrapbook, recalling the tender moments they shared. On the final page, Ellie left a short note for Carl, thanking him for their life's adventure and urging him to start a new one. Looking back on his recent journey, Carl realizes leaving his friends was a grave mistake. His attachment to physical momentos him from pursuing an intangible, priceless adventure building new relationships. Resolving to save his friends, Carl attempts to lift off, only then realizing that the sagging balloons are no longer powerful enough to carry the encumbered house. In a powerful visual sequence, Carl removes all his heavy possessions from the home, allowing him to lift off and save his friends. In that simple action, the audience witnesses Carl's turning point. By shedding off past tragedy, Carl is able to rise above his grief and pursue life to its fullest.\nConcluding with Carl rescuing his friends and returning to the city with Russell and Dug, Up leaves the audience with a moving message about our own journeys through life. Through a lighthearted, yet emotionally resonant piece, the filmmakers warn of fixating on tragedy, proclaim the import role relationships play in overcoming grief, and affirm that loss doesn't have to prevent us from pursuing new adventures. Though the film slackens through the second act, Pixar continues its legacy of conjuring compelling and emotional animated gems. The bar for the gold standard in animation is now set as high as Carl's flying house could take it.",

            "content": "\"Up\"- You're never too old for an adventure!\n\n\t Disney and Pixar team up to create one of the most heartwarming, humorous films full of animation and imagination! Up pulls on the heart strings as broken families are healed and dreams are fulfilled throughout the movie.  The characters catch the audience's attention through captivating interactions, making them laugh and keeping them enthralled.  It is impossible not to fall in love with this movie from the beginning.  \n\nThe film Up is organized for the purpose of entertaining children and families. The directors captivate the children and the rest of the family with brilliant colors, stunning animation, and by using real life situations with deeper meaning shown throughout the movie. These real-life situations are diverse enough that just about every age can relate in one way or another to the characters themselves, not just the situation they are experiencing. This includes the characters' distinct personalities as well.  Carl, or \"Mr. Fredrickson\" is first portrayed as a young boy as he goes through his life and meets his wife Ellie as a little girl. She dreams of nothing but traveling the world! They bond over their fascination of Charles F. Muntz, a pilot who has traveled the globe time and time again, as he makes many amazing scientific discoveries in his airship designed by he himself. Eventually Ellie and Carl get married and decide to start a family of their own as different slides depict Ellie's inability to have children. Heartbreaking as it is, we find out that Ellie passes away while a scene of Carl walking away from her casket is shown.\n\n Mr. Fredrickson, later as a grumpy 78-year-old retired balloon salesman living alone, wanted nothing more than to continue to reside in his own home. The same house that he and his wife Ellie built together and grew old in, before she passed away. After assaulting a construction worker with his cane, he is forced to leave his property so they can continue to build a shopping center. He loves his house so much he refuses to give it up. He comes up with a somewhat crazy impossible idea: to connect hundreds of helium balloons to his house though the chimney and lift it from the ground, steering with only blankets and sheets as sails. \n\nAt this point in the movie everyone is hooked. Mr. Fredrickson has set sail to South America where Ellie had always dreamed of going. He didn't even have to leave the house and the adventure had already begun! What Mr. Fredrickson did not know was that there was an 8-year-old wilderness explorer (Russell) as a stowaway on his front porch! The same chubby little boy who had showed up a couple days before begging to \"assist the elderly\" or help Mr. Fredrickson to walk across the street. This was, so that he could receive his last merit badge from his Boy Scout organization. They go throughout the rest of this exciting film exploring and going on many different adventures as Russell gets to \"assist\" Mr. Fredrickson. A bond develops between them as they face challenges. They meet fantastic friends and foes along the way. The first of them being a dog named Dug who has a collar that allows him to speak, and Kevin a 13-foot-tall bird who cannot fly. They definitely make the audience laugh more than anyone! One particularly funny moment is when Dug is attached to Kevin's leg as he walks, begging Kevin to be his prisoner. Although Kevin cannot speak he lets out a loud squawk back at Dug as Russell yells at Dug to stop bothering Kevin. This specific scene makes the children laugh and relates to the adults as well because it is very similar to a parent getting after their children.  \n\n The climax hits, and Russell and Mr. Fredrickson are stuck against saving Kevin from once loved and admired Charles F. Muntz and his pack of talking dogs! This is where the directors, Pete Doctor and Bob Peterson could have done a better job illustrating the antagonists of this movie. The pack of dogs was funny, but could be considered too much at times with their meaningless jokes. Despite that, they did contribute to the chase, and the feeling of adventure while Russel, Dug and Mr. Fredrickson attempted to save Kevin. \n\nPeterson and Doctor have worked together to also direct the movies: Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Finding nemo, and The Incredibles. We can see a pattern in these specific films all being aimed to entertain children and families. Peterson and Doctor meant for everyone to love and relate to these characters and their realistic situations. These directors make a pretty good effort of displaying exactly how the characters might act in real life. Although, with animation it can be hard to tell how a character is feeling without them directly saying it out loud, Doctor and Peterson do a fabulous job! Such as the scene where Russell shares with Mr. Fredrickson that his dad lives somewhere else than at home with him. During the time that he expresses his feelings, his body language is clearly shown as he fidgets with his hands, and doesn't make eye contact with Mr. Fredrickson telling the audience that this is a more sensitive, deeper subject for him to talk about. \n\nOverall, Up is a very uplifting movie. We are shown Carl's family being broken apart and later find out that Russell's family is broken as well. The movie plays on, and it only goes up from there. The characters Carl and Russell change in positive ways developing a close relationship with each other that closes the gap in their hearts with love, and heals their broken families. The most heartwarming part is when Mr. Fredrickson makes it just in time to present Russell with his \"assist the elderly\" merit badge. This meant so much to Russell that Mr. Fredrickson becomes somewhat of a father figure to him. They both sit down to eat ice cream together realizing they have exactly what they thought they were missing; a friendship full of love and adventure. Sometimes we don't know how things will turn out, what our destination will be, or what we will accomplish, but that's what lets us call it an adventure.",

            "content": "Up is one of those films that sticks with you long after the credits are done rolling. It hits you on a number of different levels, bordering close to perfection. I don't think I've seen a film that manages to switch from hurt to hilarious in such an effortless fashion.\n\nIn the beginning you meet Ellie, a cute little girl full of adventure. Her energy and excitement bleed off the screen and you can't help but smile at her. She's perfect for Carl, an innocent kid who barely says more than a few words. Their imaginative adventures get you into the story immediately. It's a relationship that makes the first ten minutes that much harder to watch. There are moments in the film that never lose impact which is testament to the film's power to stand the test of time.\n\nFor a child's film, there are a lot of layers that really make the film special. It isn't long before we get to meet Russell, an innocent boyscout turned star of the movie. He's just trying to earn another badge by helping the elderly. Underneath this unassuming kid is hurt from all the painful things happening in his life. Each character has their own respective backstory that makes them relatable and lovable.\n\nThere's good ole Doug the runt of a talking dog pack who can't seem to do right even when he tries his best. He's an outcast amongst the other dogs while still harboring those wonderful dogs traits that humans can't help but love. And how can you not love the colorful snipe Kevin whose only goal is to take care of her kids (yes, HER name is Kevin)? All of these characters are worthy of their own standalone film which is why bringing them all together for one story makes the film spectacular.\n\nAt the core of the story is the odd couple relationship between Kevin and Russell. Young and old meet and it couldn't be funnier to see the two try and operate together. As they try and understand each other, they form an unlikely bond, a closeness that was lost from both of their lives. At the risk of sounding like a teenager, it will give you all the feels.\n\nThere could be some missteps in this wonderful adventure about a man who decides to fly away in his house using thousands of balloons, but those missteps are minute. Not only are the visuals amazing, but the message is also a strong one: Don't get stuck in the past. Live life for the now.\n\nUp is a classic. I give it a 99.",

I'll start with the opening ten or so minutes. It consists of one of the most touching and heartbreaking montages you'll ever see. They crafted a stronger love story in ten minutes than most movies can do in two hours. Hell, some TV shows can't even do this over the course of several seasons. I've seen it several times and it always chokes me up. The film masterfully weaves the emotional stuff with the fun adventure that kids come to see. Carl Fredrickson (Ed Asner) is a great protagonist. He's flawed and haunted by missing his wife, yet likable. Russell (Jordan Nagai) is a great sidekick with his own sad tale. You feel for him when he talks about his absentee father. Dug (Bob Peterson) and Kevin (Pete Doctor) made for fun side characters, with Dug stealing the show as cute comic relief. The score is a highlight and, like everything Pixar does, it's visually stunning. \n\nWeaknesses: If I had to pick one issue, I'd say the movie doesn't exactly work for all kids. A lot of the younger audience won't understand some of the story pieces. That's just nitpicking, though.\n\nOverall: If it wasn't for Toy Story, I firmly believe Up would be their greatest creation. It's wonderful in every way and very deserving of the Best Picture nomination it received.",

I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls...\" Disney Pixar's Up takes flight as a heart-warming film that depicts the unexpected adventure of an irritable geezer and full of life boy scout into \"a land lost in time\". \nYoung Carl Fredrickson's zeal for adventure was sparked by his idol, Charles Muntz (an explorer who traveled to South America in his blimp, in hopes to clear his name and find the 'Monster of Paradise Falls'). While on his usual jaunt home, young Carl comes in contact with a spunky red-headed girl who just so happened to be a fellow Charles Muntz enthusiast as well. Two people who couldn't have been more different fall in love over time, eventually get married, and devote their lives to adventure. Their ultimate goal for adventure being to save up funds to purchase tickets to visit Paradise Falls like their childhood hero. Along the way, they suffer little mishaps that prolong their ability to reach their goal. But when Ellie passes away, their life long dream of visiting Paradise Falls is put on hold and appears to disappear. The once fun-loving, happy, and go-getting Carl Fredrickson turns into a crusty and bitter old man without his lover by his side. It isn't until a seemingly inconsequential knock on Mr. Fredrickson's door by a wilderness explorer named Russell (who is working towards earning his assisting the elderly badge) that Mr. Fredrickson's life and perspective on life is forever changed. \nDue to events along the way, Mr. Fredrickson decides it is time to get out of dodge and finally fulfill his and his wife's dreams of going to Paradise Falls. He attaches more balloons than you can imagine to his house and takes flight. Unbeknownst to Mr. Fredrickson, Russell accidentally becomes a part of his journey. When they make it to Paradise Falls, they land on the opposite side of where they intended. They then proceed to finish up their journey by making it to their desired destination- the other side. Along the way, they befriend a giant bird named Kevin, Doug the dog, and eventually come in contact with the one and only Charles Muntz. What is a dream comes true quickly detours and becomes a 'battle for the bird'. Charles Muntz wants to take Kevin back home to prove to everyone that he isn't a madman and that the 'Monster of Paradise Falls' is real. On the other hand, Mr. Fredrickson and Russell want to protect Kevin in order to take her back to her little baby birds. \nIn hopes of getting the bird, Charles Muntz manages to catch Kevin in a net. As Mr. Fredrickson and Russell furiously try to cut the net to set Kevin free, Muntz sets Mr. Fredrickson's house in flames. In this moment, Mr. Fredrickson has to essentially choose between holding on to the bird (symbolizing change and a new life) or his home (symbolizing the past and his wife). After a moment of deliberation, Mr. Fredrickson bolts to his house. In the midst of chaos, Muntz takes the bird. Once Muntz takes off with the bird in his large blimp, Russell and Mr. Fredrickson part ways. Russell sets off to save Kevin and Mr. Fredrickson decides to stay and accomplish why they traveled to Paradise Falls in the first place- to place his home on the other side of the falls. When on his own, Mr. Fredrickson takes a moment to reminisce. He tidies up his house somewhat and takes a seat in his chair to look through his sweet wife's Adventure Book. As the page titled \"stuff we are going to do\" slides down, what he previously thought to be empty space was instead pages filled with pictures of him and his wife's many adventures together throughout the years. On the last page, Ellie wrote, \"Thanks for the adventure- now go have a new one!\". It was at this point where Mr. Fredrickson's hardened heart was softened. It was in this moment where he was able to finally come to peace with the death of this sweetheart and decide to start a new chapter in his life. \nDisney Pixar's Up is a heart-warming movie that perfectly exemplifies the importance of not dwelling on the past, because if you do, you will miss out on all the new and exciting adventures that surround you. Also, that it is important to make the most out of every situation we are given. Mr. Fredrickson was stubborn and did not yield to the constant change that was occurring in life around him once his wife died. He was miserable and wasn't willing to experience the new adventure that was out there. But once he came full circle and allowed Russell (aka change) into his life, he was able to experience the joy that life had to offer. He was able to find strength in the quiet moments of life- eating ice cream on the curb while counting how many blue and red cars passed by while spending time with people who matter the most. \nUp is a wonderful film that can serve as an eye-opener to all of us. It is important for us to evaluate what we are focusing our time on. If we are stuck in the past, then maybe it is time to broaden our horizons and take up the spirit of adventure to see what adventure awaits us. Charles Muntz said it best, \"Adventure is out there!\". Now it is our duty to go out and explore.",

            "content": "Chang Hyun Cho\nUP (2009)\nThe particular scene and scenario in this movie make the movie UP famous animation in the world. It is directed at 2009 by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson. Both of them are popular with directing the various animation movies such as Toy story, Inside out, and the Good Dinosaur. The other animation movies usually made of comedy or adventures only. However, I believe this UP animation is one of the masterpieces in animation genre, because this one includes entertainment, impression, adventure, and also fun part. Also, it is important to understand happiness in our life in order to be happy.\n\nEveryone is appropriate for this animated movie since it does not include any cruel scenes and at same time includes thing other than comedy or adventure. Therefore, there is no moment to bore while watching a movie because of the perfect blend of heart and humor in this animation movie. I agree that there is no boring moment while you are watching movie, because the blend of heart and humor makes this animation special compared to other animation movies.\n\nEspecially, the impression part in the movie is remarkable than other scenes that are adventure and fun parts. During the filming, Carl who is one of the main characters thinks that happiness is far away from him after separation from Ellie who has lived together for a lifetime. They live together with same dreams of going Paradise Falls for happiness, but Ellie dies before they adventure. Therefore, he leaves adventure himself by hanging thousands of balloons on the roof in order to find the happiness. However, there was an uninvited visitor to this great adventure, the explorer Russell who was Boy Scout. On their adventures, Carl overcomes many difficult situations along with Russell and his dream is accomplished, but he feels only vanity and understands real happiness.\n\nMoreover, flying with balloons on the roof can be adventure but also romantic scene in this animation movie, because it is difficult to do actions like this even though this action is not real. Also, I believe it is romantic since Carl did these difficult actions just for Ellie whom is Carl's wife. Therefore, many people are enthusiastic and are deeply moved by this part of the movie. Also, I believe the audiences are able to focus on this animation movie that was the most interesting and entertaining compared to other animation movies since this one have various genres.\n\nAccording to csmonitor review, \"Up\" is less visually exuberant than many of the other Pixar films. However, I could feel the sympathy of flying even though this movie is less visually exuberant than any other animation films. Rather, the less visually stunning thing seems to make this film more prominent. In rogerebert reviews, \"Up\" tells a story as tickling to the imagination as the magical animated films of my childhood, when I naively thought that because their colors were brighter, their character outlines more defined and their plots simpler, they were actually more realistic than regular films. My feelings on the issue are mixed. I understand that this movie is realistic than regular films, but I also think it artistic since it shows impractical scenes such as flying the house with just balloons and controlling the directions with wind.\n\nI would like to watch it again next time and also recommend this animation movie to others. Many people experience at least one depression in their life. However, this animation movie called \"Up\" gives the audiences about the lesson that happiness is not far away from us. Therefore, it is possible to make people think of happiness once again. I admit it is important to know that the happiness is not far away from us before you are actually happy in your life. In addition, the reason why this animation movie is loved by audiences is because this film is the best analogy of life.",

            "content": "At the time of this writing, Disney-Pixar's Up has received a 98% rating at Rotten Tomatoes. That means that 98% of the nation's movie critics have given it the \"thumbs up.\" Such a high rating almost never happens.\n\nThat said, any movie, no matter how great, can be over-hyped, which can ruin the experience. For example, Ratatouille received such acclaim that my initial viewing of it was met with disappointment (though I appreciated it much, much more the second time around). So, in the interest of not raising the bar too high, I will simply say that Up continues Pixar's streak of excellence.\n\nCombining poignant and profound themes with memorable characters and a contagious sense of adventure is par for the course for the group that brought us Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, and Wall-E. What do all these films have in common? They effectively tap into our childlike sense of wonder while never insulting our intelligence or emotional maturity (or that of children, for that matter).\n\nLikewise, Pixar makes the most visually stunning and sharply humorous films of anyone doing animation right now. In fact, they make some of the best films, period. Up is no exception, and it ranks particularly high on my Pixar list because it did something the others didn't. It made me cry. Twice. Up got me going, with a pair of wordless moments (one towards the beginning, the other towards the end) that drive home how precious of a gift our lives are, as well as the people in them.\n\nDon't worry, though, the movie is more of an adventure-comedy than a tearjerker. It simply has a beating heart, as the best adventures (and often the best comedies) do. It's thrilling. It's funny. For some reason I felt it dragged very slightly in the middle before kicking into high gear for the third act, but that's a minor complaint for something so thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. Oh, by the way, I wanted to take Doug (the dog) home with me. You will too. MY GRADE: A.",

Pixar has done it again by making dreams reality just as they did in WALL-E: taking the universe and finding happiness after it had been lost. Up took me to a new world where \"adventure\" really was \"out there.\"  My heart strings were destroyed within the first 30 minutes of the film as it set the backstory for the main character. However, my heart strings were sewn back together again throughout the rest of the movie. The film features talking dogs, an attention seeking kid, and two grumpy old men. This movie seriously has it all. While it may be a children's movie, anyone at any age will come away from this movie with something gained. For me, it made me want to go out and live my dreams even if it's something as spectacular and out of the box as living in a house in the sky being held in the air by balloons (talk about your castle in the sky). \n     The movie kicks off with two very different children: Ellie a hickish, outgoing little girl, and Carl a very shy and polite young man. However, both of them had one thing in common: a desire for adventure. As they grow up, they grow closer together and end up getting married and start getting old together. Heads up: minor spoiler here. However, tragedy strikes and Carl is left a grumpy old man with a dream that Ellie and him had never been able to fulfill. This is where the real story begins... \n  Carl finds himself having to make a decision, which results in a dramatic decision and his home up in the air attached to hundreds of balloons. A boy scout, Russell, incidentally finds himself up in the air with old man Carl. Despite Russell's happy demeanor, he has more in common with grumpy Carl than it seems. Now the unlikely duo embark on a journey to South Africa where \"adventure\" is found. If that doesn't intrigue you enough, throw in a talking dog named Doug and a giant bird for a few laughs. In every good journey story, there are obstacles. In this case, it comes in the form of Carl and Ellie's childhood idol. As Carl finally attains his and Ellie's dream, he makes choices that put both Russell and him in danger. \n   This is a movie you have to watch to really understand the magnitude of this story. The filmmakers were smart making Up an animated movie because it brings everyone back to their childhood where all dreams are possible. If you are looking for a love tale, you got it. What about action packed? Well Up has that, too! It's great for kids and the whole family! Bring the tissues and a thirst for adventure because Up is literally blowing up the screen. Childhood dreams are accomplished and new friends are made, proving that it is never too late to start a new adventure. What are you waiting for? Get Up and get out there and watch the greatest Pixar film to date.",

Up I feel should be remembered for being a massive step in not only how animation is done visually, but also how animations can be compared on the same level as any other movie out there. This is truly a masterpiece, it builds itself into an emotional rollercoaster that also makes you laugh and really this is exactly how to do animation perfectly.\n\nThe story see's Carl Fredricksen an old man living by himself after his wife has died, that isn't where the plot picks up from though no, first it has to toy with your emotions and oh man the start to this film is tough to not feel something for. We see Carl's life and it has been good to him, it had its hard moments but most times he and his wife were extremely happy together, until she passed away and that is where the story picks up from. Carl made a promise to his wife to set up a house on top of a place called \"Paradise Falls\", a large waterfall somewhere in South America, and he is going to do it with balloons of all things. The film sways around, frantic at times and then sweet again and although that may not sound so good, it is in fact timed to perfection; the movie never loses momentum and keeps you watching from the first second to the last.\n\nPixar haven't just made a great film, they've made an astounding one and also one that very much deserved its Best Picture nomination at the 82nd Academy awards. Pete Docter directs this in a visually stunning way, he not only gets the most out of the rich colours on offer, but he also puts things in that look amazingly real. Jonas Rivera's script is fine as well and really lays the foundations for all the comedy side if this; this is really one movie where physical humour is entwined well with comedy in dialogue. The characters are fantastically developed as well with not only Carl well done, the young boy Russell is finely thought up as well, he and Carl create one of the best duo's in animation movies.\n\nThe way in which it also uses it's colour to bring out everything is even more impressive, the fine tones of the clothing, the beautiful animation style and the just general way in which this flows is beautiful. It is such a loveable movie as well, one that is maybe recommended for the kids but this is one for the adults too because this is one thing that can make anyone cry, whether that be by the funny bits in this or the heart wrenching moments.\n\nSo Up, one of the best animations ever, for sure. I don't really have a group of people I would recommend this to but I mean that in a way where I believe that anyone can enjoy this. It's one of Pixar's finest for years and shows they are one of the most consistent movie churners out there, producing film after film that are not only movies that are financially successful, but also one's with big hearts as well.",

Yes the themes of age and family run so strongly through the beautiful narrative and characters here that the film brings constant emotion, yet at the same time that doesn't stop it from bringing all the magical Pixar fun that you'd expect. Effectively then, you could say it's Pixar cranked up to eleven, and that is a compliment in many different ways.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Sometimes it's so gushing with all those charms that it feels like it's trying too hard and has lost some of its more humble beauty.\nVERDICT: Another brilliant Pixar film where the usual tropes are layered on even thicker; 'Up' is a genuinely emotional rollercoaster.",

            "content": "When you think about the basic premise of this movie, it's a pretty strange one. An old man taking his own house to South America of all places by lifting it up with balloons. That is very bizarre, but also very original. And Pixar is known for coming up with these very unique ideas, so it was interesting to see what they could do with this concept.\n\nOnce again, Pixar had shown us that they are one of the best in the animation industry. Not only did it have very likable characters, beautiful animation, hilarious jokes, and a unique story, but man is it emotional. Pixar is also known for being able to really tug you at the heartstrings, and they really do it in this movie, particularly the first 10 minutes. Two children who are polar opposites, Carl is a shy and polite little boy and Ellie is a energetic and fun-loving little girl, immediately befriend each other due to sharing their desires of going on adventures. In a matter of minutes, we see their whole life flash before them. They get married, they work together, they wanted to have a child but are sadly not able to, they continue to realize their dream of visiting Paradise Falls by saving up money, but constantly have to spend it on other needs in their life, and continues on until they reach old age right before (SPOILER ALERT): Ellie meets her inevitable death. All of this is done without any dialogue, just in mime, visuals, and Michael Giacchino's beautiful music. He earned that Oscar. This scene is probably the best and most emotional thing that Pixar has ever done, or perhaps any film has ever done. It just gives everyone the idea of what life is. So, what else can I say about it that has already been said so many times? Well, what I can say is that I first saw this movie when I was ten years old. Since I was a kid, I couldn't relate to it that much and wasn't emotionally devastated like everyone else. I didn't know what to make of it. But now, of course, I understand. It's a huge tearjerker, everybody loves the opening scene of the movie.\n\nAnd that's only the first 10 minutes. How's the rest of the movie? Some complain that the rest of the movie is just okay when comparing to that incredible opening scene, it doesn't ever reach the same level brilliance. I can understand that and I do kind of agree. After the opening, the movie becomes a fun and happy adventure with the old man and the boy that he gets stuck with, and meets a few other characters along the way, including his hero Charles Muntz, (SPOILER ALERT): who is actually the villain. But, don't you think they would need that fun adventure because of that heart-wrenching scene in the beginning?\n\nAnd plus, I love the adventure that the characters go through. For one thing, the landscapes of Paradise Falls are absolutely beautiful to look at. And the characters they focus on are so likable that you want to stay with them throughout the entire movie, and they do! I love the growing bond between Carl and Russell, I really feel a genuine friendship between them. I love how they give so much personality to the animals, like the bird and all of the dogs. I want to see the bird get back home to her babies, and they absolutely nailed the personality of the dogs by giving them a voice box, which led to a ton of hilarious jokes. My favorite being the high-pitched voice box on the menacing Alpha dog. And even though it's kind of obvious that Muntz is the surprise villain, it makes sense why he is the main antagonist. He's been hunting for this bird all his life, and his desire to capture it has driven him insane over the years.\n\nThere is actually one scene that I think is almost just as powerful as the opening, and that's when Carl looks through his adventure book and sees all the photos with him and Ellie together. It shows that they weren't only trying to save up to go to Paradise Falls like what we saw in the opening, it shows that they've had a fun and happy life together. The moral of that scene is so meaningful, that it's okay that life might not always end up the way you want it or expected it to. Your life is full of adventures that can be treasured, especially the ones that are shared by the people you love. That last quote perfectly illustrates the moral, \"Thanks for the adventure - now go have a new one! Love, Ellie.\" I'll admit, sometimes I get a little teary-eyed at that scene.\n\nIn conclusion, the film gives us a fun and surreal adventure with very likable characters, beautiful animation, and a perfect amount of pathos that so many people can relate to. Even though I personally don't relate to it as much as something like TOY STORY, THE INCREDIBLES, or INSIDE OUT, I perfectly understand the poignancy of it. Overall, UP is a wonderful film, and I give so much credit to director Pete Docter, he really knows how to direct a great Pixar film.\n\nGrade: A+",

This event scars Carl so much that he decides to go into a real adventure in the place where his wife and he always wanted to see: South America. \nJudging by the premise, you may think that this is Pixar´s simplest film as it's not about superheroes or an ironic mixture of stories, but about normal human beings; but if you believe that, you are dead wrong. \"Up\" has memorable, excellently design and extremely likeable characters that are ultimately one of the greatest creations of the studio; the story is so sympathetic and filled with sentiment that you will remember every detail of it, it has numerous surreal ideas that make a beautiful world, the comedy is childish but it always works, the relationships of the characters are genuine and the very heart and soul of this film, some of the visuals are unforgettable, Pixar´s greatest love story (I really doubt that they will ever made something better than this), the South American environment is gorgeous, the pacing can go from sad/tearful to happy/whimsical, the drama will absorb you and make you feel a variety of emotions, it has the greatest character arcs of any Pixar film to date, an unforgettable musical theme, it has the greatest opening act of any animated film I have ever seen, it has a little bit of darkness within this colorful world, the running time is well used, the bizarre settings never overshadow the story (unlike certain Pixar film), and of course the animation continues to be jaw dropping.  \n\"Up\" is a surprising surreal drama in the form of an animated film (It's not for nothing the second animated film to be nominated for Best Picture). For me, this is the greatest film the studio has made (at the time this review was written) as it's something more than an animated film, it is an adventure in every way possible. The ultimate masterpiece of a studio that almost always hits their target.",

Speaking of beauty, whoever story boarded for this picture did an impeccable job. Never before have I been so grasped by colorful visuals.

            "content": "Along with the three Toy Story films, Up represents the pinnacle of Pixar's cinematic achievements - as the movie is as entertaining, engrossing, and moving as anything within the animated realm. The film follows 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) as he attempts to fulfill his lifelong dream of traveling to South America, though he does this by arming his rickety old house with thousands of helium balloons. The journey immediately stumbles as Carl discovers that he's taken on a stowaway in the form of an eager young Wilderness Scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai), with their eventual arrival in South America bringing them face-to-face with both friends (Dug, an adorable talking dog) and foes (Charles Muntz, a fearsome explorer). It's an off-the-wall premise that's utilized to consistently enthralling effect by filmmakers Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, with the fully-realized nature of the central character certainly playing a substantial role in the movie's palpable success. Docter and Peterson, working from their own screenplay, kick the proceedings off with an absolutely stunning stretch devoted entirely to Carl's backstory, and it almost feels as though the film has painted itself into a corner with this emotionally devastating portrait of Carl's marriage to his childhood sweetheart (ie how can the movie possibly top its opening 20 minutes?) The chemistry between Carl and Russell certainly plays a pivotal role in Up's subsequent success, with the pair's various misadventures in South America heightened by the frequently breathtaking visuals and ongoing emphasis on colorful supporting characters (with Dug undoubtedly stealing every single one of his scenes). By the time the action-heavy yet thoroughly stirring (and even a little moving) climax rolls around, Up has firmly cemented its place as an animated masterpiece that deserves to be mentioned alongside the genre's best and most respected offerings.",

And without a single word of dialogue, Up pulled no punches with the heartbreaking opening montage-- and it was just getting started. By the time it's all over, Up had taken you on a journey from crowded city streets to the mountains of Venezuela, helped mend Carl's broken heart, shared a couple messages and, yes, made us laugh a time or two.

Most animated films are based on some book or fairytale or legend. But almost every pixar avoids this, thank god. And this is what we get. And we are pleased. Very pleased. This film is perhaps one of the studio's more witty and adventurous outings that doesnt personify toys or bugs or monsters or robots. It just takes you on a ride. A beautifully crafted one. The characters: carl, charles, dug and russell are seemingly engaging. The story is heartfelt and reverberates through your soul. Sadly though, there is one small,  minute criticism of this film. The film does drag a little. Plus there isnt enough dug",

            "content": "Since Up won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for Best Picture, it sounded like top notch Pixar entertainment.\n\nUp is able to establish a sense of sentimentality really early in. After the film touches upon the source of Carl Fredricksen's childhood dreams, it works to establish them with the relationship he shares with the love of his life Ellie Fredricksen as the heart of the story before it transitions into the fantastical journey that it is known for. Up succesfully works at tugging the heartstrings of viewers early on and creating a sentimental mood to start the entire feature off. It does this with minimal dialogue, like a silent movie where everything is physical or left to the implications. It is really well done because it puts all the focus into the gentle atmosphere and visual elements of the film, giving the film a strong start.\nUp didn't really reach me as much as other viewers. I enjoyed the film, but I found that the creativity was lacking. The characters in the film were not as iconic as creations that ones such as Woody, Wall-E or Dory have been. There is plenty of creativity in certain aspects of the film, but when it comes to the writing it just isn't there. The story is really thrown together and the sense of adventure is not so direct as the purpose of the journey is not as clear as it could be. There are some touching themes in the film, but it mixes reality with fantasy uneasily and never exactly sticks to one, making it a story about human characters in a completely unrealistic setting. The general mood of the film confused me because the humour was very juvenile while the story was thrown together with sentimental undertones, and it just never felt right. From a story perspective, Up comes up short. It maintains the best intentions and some strong themes, but the actual story itself felt lazy. I'll admit that I felt something for the protagonist as the film chronicled him living out the dreams he shared with his late wife, but the story saw him teamed up with Russell as a sidekick. Russell proved to be a character without much juvenile charm, and in fact he was actual just an annoying foil. He brought little value to the story in terms of either comic relief or genuine sympathy whatsoever. While the voice efforts of Jordan Nagai were good because he captured the over the top energy for the part and delivered his lines well, the character just seemed annoying. Up had an annoying character and a lazy story which dominated so much of the film which I simply could not overlook and it damaged much of the experience.\nNevertheless, Up remained a good film. It was touching in parts, but I also found that there was a lot of clever humour at times. It mainly stemmed from the story element about dogs using technology to communicate in English. The way that the canine characters speak in comparison to their facial expressions and such is very funny. The concept of dogs communicating is one that has high potential if the writing behind it knows what to do, and Up was one of the better examples. There were a lot of clever uses of this in the film, and so the comedy in Up does prove to be funny most of the time. I laughed plenty, but I was more impressed with the technical characteristics of the film.\nAs with every Disney Pixar film, Up is another feature with incredible animation. The three dimensional detail is exceptional with Up having an excellent look for its human characters who all have their iconic visual elements to them, while the other creatures all look great. There is so much detail in the setting and the movements of everything that it is unforgettable. The amount of colour in the film is also amazing because it fuels the feature with all kinds of energy. Up uses visual elements a lot of the time to tell its story without dialogue like it does in the intro scene, and the colourful detail is exquisite. \nThe musical score in Up is also very impressive. While the adventure in the script was not amazing, the musical score ensures that viewers are able to grasp the scale that director Pete Docter was going for. It helps to make the film reach the large scale of the journey within it and add to the gleeful energy of the feature, while in its more gentle moments Up is able to create a strongly sentimental atmosphere by adding a light touch of emotion to the feature. Up always feels like it should even if the story is not perfectly tied together, and so the musical score of the feature remains one of its best aspects in terms of establishing atmosphere.\nThe voice acting is also nice, in particular the leading effort of Edward Asner. In the part of Carl Fredricksen, Edward Asner is the perfect fit simply because his natural tone of voice maintains a sense of frailty to it while he also has a touch of determination about him. He makes a fine fit for the part of an old gentleman and doesn't resort too much to grouchiness which prevents him from being an archetype. He is a protagonist that viewers can easily find themselves caring about, and Carl Fredricksen ensures that the Spencer Tracy type charm is established in the part with his intricate line delivery. He does a great job and shares a friendly voice chemistry with Jordan Nagai as their friendship develops over the course of the story. The pair of voice actors make a strong duo, even if the character Russell gets annoying at times.\nBob Peterson delivers a really strong efort in the role of Dug because his subtle charm in the role of Dug the Golden Retriever is perfectly on par. And as always, the cameo of John Ratzenberger is a great touch.\n\nSo Up has some nice elements of sentimentality to it as well as excellent animation, a wonderful musical score and some good humour which is enough to make up for the loosely written story.",

            "content": "The movie \"UP\" is an enjoyable film because of the emotion and animation, love, and the script itself. It begins with a sweet and innocent love story shared by two young kids, Carl and Ellie. They connect with their love for exploring. As they grow up they fall in love and become married. During their time together they have a dream to go to Paradise falls which they plan to do with a coin jar full of savings. Life gets in their way and puts the dreams on hold, and as it goes they never get the chance to go because Ellie passes. Carl leaves their house almost as a memorial to her, he never changes a thing. Due to his old age and other complications Carl decides to put balloons onto the house and fly away.. However, a boy scout by the name of Russell is stuck out in the sky with him floating to Paradise Falls where Carl is tested in a few different ways. \nThe emotion and animation of the movie made it so touching in different ways. The entire scene between Carl and Ellie was interpreted and presented with no words, only music as you watched their lives unfold. I believe this really drew the audience in to focus on the relationship set before them. You saw the innocence and simplicity between the two. \nLove in general is another main aspect in the movie. Not only did Carl have a great love for Ellie to where even after her passing her tried to keep her alive, but he had to learn to love again. Russell was a pain for Carl in the beginning of the movie, Carl was a grumpy old man and Russell a lively boy scout, but he overcame his reclusive attitude and ended up enjoying Russell's company. \nWhile \"UP\" is obviously a movie for a younger audience, it teaches a lesson to all ages of individuals. The script itself is quite amazing. It teaches you that just because one adventure ends, does not mean you can't start another one. Carl lost his significant other, but the movie shows us Ellie did not want him mourning her memory. She wanted Carl to begin a new adventure. \nAll in all, \"UP\" is an excellent movie. It is very sweet, fun, and would be likable by all ages.",

            "content": "Pixar (or Disney as a whole) films deserve credit for occasionally driving adult-oriented themes through children-oriented animated whimsy. In the first ten minutes, my heart sank for the protagonist Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner), whom we witness as a child meeting his future wife, marrying, being told that they can't have any children, funding their lifelong dream of moving to a specific location in South America, unwillingly using such funds for other purposes, and lastly, as a very old man, caring for his wife on his death bed. They ultimately never went to South America together. I am now depressed. That whole opening sequence only has a few lines, otherwise being a compelling montage. Don't worry, kids. It's a Pixar film. The mood picks up quickly, when a young boy scout Russell acts as sidekick to Carl as he travels to South America via his house tied to hundreds of balloons. Once they arrive in the area, the two encounter a talking dog named Dug, a tall exotic bird named Kevin, and Carl's childhood hero Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Russell wants to bring Kevin back to her nest, but Muntz has longed to capture Kevin for publicity. Meanwhile, Carl only longs to bring his house to the specific location. If I had to tell you, Carl joins the side of Russell, trying his best to protect Kevin from Muntz. Muntz has a whole army of talking dogs, it turns out, and a grand aerial war soon takes place. I understand why children might enjoy the action, but for me, I only cared about seeing how Carl develops as a character. And in that respect, I was satisfied. The animation is as good as Pixar usually gets, and the jokes can suit the taste buds for both children and adults. Perhaps a reason that I don't love animated films to the degree that others do is because the elements suited for children do not tend to interest me. For adults, I recommend watching it for how Carl handles the death of his wife, and soon moves on by fulfilling the wishes that he did not fulfill while his wife was still alive.",

I had heard plenty of great things about this film, and heard it was one of the sadder of Pixar's output. With that being said, the film is sad, but it so makes you feel good, and it's really one that makes you feel all sorts of things. I've seen many of Pixar's films, and each of them has that quality that makes it so good, with UP, we get something more, we get a film that goes deep in its story and adds a lot more depth into one film. One minute the tone is sad, heartfelt, the next, it's funny, whimsical and adventurous. But as a whole, Up is a standout picture, one of the finest of Pixar's animated features, and is highly entertaining from start to finish. If you want a great animated comedy, Up is a great film to watch and it's a film for all ages, one that has a simple, but well constructed story, and it is a film that just has plenty of charm to really make it standout, and it's easily one of the finest films that Pixar has ever produced.  If you enjoy animated feature, Up will certainly deliver, and it's one of those movies that is purely entrancing from the first frame, and it doesn't let go until the wonderful final.  Brilliantly animated, and with a great script Up is yet another solid animated feature from Pixar, who always deliver some truly wonderful, amusing and highly memorable pictures. Although there are some sad moments here and there, the film just makes you feel good, and as the film goes on, the story is richer, fuller and gets even more enjoyable. If you enjoy animated films, especially Pixar films, definitely don't pass up this great film. Up is one of the studios finest works, and that's saying something.",

But  let me begin with the story before I focus on the flaws: Up is about a man who has lost his wife. And after that he ( and I am not making this up) ties balloons to his house to go to Paradise Falls, where he dreams to go.  And to make things worse, he is abandoned with a kid named Russell. He meets some other problems too, but I won't go I depth.\n\nSo anyhow, the flaws. And there are a ton. Firstly, Up is about a guy tying BALLOONS to his goddamn house and DOGS PILOTING airplanes. \n\nDuh? \n\nAnd you may not understand this, but if Charles Muntz, is the Old guy's hero when the protagonist was a kid, wouldn't he be 120 years old now? WTF?\nApart from the GAPING PLOT HOLES, this movie suffers from other flaws, but I won't mention it. Many people have described this movie is touching and stuff like that, but really? I did not cry even once!\n\nThe voice acting is decent, and so are the visuals (even if certain aspects seem rushed). And it is funny, but only once in a while. But it isn't  worthy of the critical praise it gets, and not worthy of being called the best Pixar movie.\n\nOther aspects are limited but I won't talk about it. Even in its  most touching and \nsentimental scenes there's nothing really I ever cried on.\n\n\n4/10 stars.",

This scene has impact, there's no dialogue, just the power of music and animation, it's possibly one of the most moving and touching moments in an animated movie for years. With dazzling animation bursting to life with lively colours and lots of imagination, Up is simply unmissable and yet another highly rated adventure from Pixar. Voice over work is tremendous and the laughs come fast and loud, but for the techno geeks give this a miss in 3D and stick to 2D.",

As Pixar usually does, the characters are all very unique in appearance and that adds so much character, especially in this movie.\n\nThe subtle parts of Carl's model carry his character, as do Russell's. His chubbiness and fullness represents how full of energy he is, and makes him appear very eager, while Carl's boxy head shape and short stature do make him appear more elderly and grumpy.

Today I watched it for only the second time and I have a whole new perspective on it. It really touches on some of the small but important moments of life and in doing so it made me cry several times. Bravo Pixar, bravo.",

And I liked the characters for the most part. I was also really touched by the scene where Carl looks through Ellie's adventure book and finds out they she included pictures of their married life as her \"adventure\". It was sweet.",

This movie was an homage to Howl's Moving Castle that fell apart plot-wise but still managed to capture everyone's heart.  So, it's... okay I guess.",
