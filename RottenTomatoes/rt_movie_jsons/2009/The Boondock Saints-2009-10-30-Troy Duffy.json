    "summary": "Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) have been living in Ireland for several years, working on a farm with their father (Billy Connolly). When they learn they've been charged with the murder of a Roman Catholic priest, the brothers travel to Boston to clear their names. Along the way, they meet Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr.), a street fighter who joins them in their quest to find Concezio Yakavetta (Judd Nelson), a mobster who they think is really behind the murder.",

            "content": "After the MacManus twins, Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus), and their father, Noah \"Il Duce\" (Billy Connolly), assassinated Joe Yakavetta, they fled to Ireland. Eight years later, their uncle Father Sibeal arrives to inform them that a renowned Boston priest was murdered by a mysterious assassin who attempted to frame the Saints by using their ritual assassination style. In response, the twins dig up their old gear and weapons and depart for the United States. En route to Boston aboard a container ship, the twins meet a Mexican underground fighter named Romeo, who recognizes them as the Saints. Romeo convinces them to let him join them as their new partner. Hearing a radio broadcast regarding Joe's son, Concezio Yakavetta, they deduce that he must have hired the hitman who killed the priest to draw them out of hiding. Meanwhile, Detectives Greenly, Dolly, and Duffy are at the scene of the priest's murder. They are greeted by Special Agent Eunice Bloom, the protégée of Paul Smecker (who has died) who has been assigned to investigate the murder and determine whether or not the Saints are responsible. She comes to the conclusion that the Saints were not who murdered the cleric, and begins an investigation to find the real assassin. She and the other officers find out the assassin is Ottilio Panza, a man who appears to be working for a mysterious man known only as \"The Old Man\"...\n\nRotten Tomatoes consensus reads: \"This sequel to the cult favorite The Boondock Saints is more of the same -- unoriginal, absurd, violent, over-the-top, and occasionally mean-spirited\". (via Wikipedia)\n\nThe brothers are back and it´s the same silly cartoony actioneer setup as in the first one. Not much to like or care about.",

            "content": "The original Boondock Saints was hardly high art, but at least it's excessiveness, gratuitousness, and silliness was fun, with Willem Dafoe making the whole thing work by holding back nothing in his performance. With him gone, the film struggles to replicate any of the entertainment value that the original had in spades, bringing in Julie Benz as a carbon copy of his character but focusing explicitly on the stunts rather than the theatrics. Narrative pacing and content is sacrificed for fanservice and self-references. Couple that with the production value of a mid-budget porno and a lapse of nearly a decade between the release of the original and the sequel, and what you ultimately end up with is an incredibly disappointing and poor-quality follow-up that fails to attract fans of the cult classic original. This 'franchise' doesn't have the clout to leave such an open door for a sequel.\n\nIt's no exaggeration to say that the action in Boondock Saints II looks like a student film version of The Matrix. The reactions to being shot are like elementary school students on a playground. (1/5)",

It was a stroke of genius. It was, if you will, like a shot poured from a bottle of the finest whisky known to human kind.

            "content": "Spoiler filled review\n\nThe sequel to Boondock Saints fails in many, many ways and answers the question Ã¢??Should I waste 1 hour and 58 minutes of my life watching the sophomore effortÃ¢???\n\nTroy Duffy directed this movie as well as the original, now IÃ¢??m very curious about what happened to him to make him think this movie needed to be goofy.  It starts off decent with plenty of good story direction.  Although I could have done without seeing both brotherÃ¢??s asses in their shower in the barn Ã¢??suit upÃ¢?? montage.  By the way, during this Ã¢??get suited upÃ¢?? montage the priest just happens to be waiting with Il Duce (Connolly) like no time had passed?  It felt as if Mr. Duffy gave us the directorÃ¢??s cut.  In fact he didnÃ¢??t want to leave anything on the cutting room floor.  It was if he said Ã¢??Hey, I filmed all this extra material!  IÃ¢??m putting it in!Ã¢??.  By putting all this extra crap in the movie, it takes away from the storyline.\n\nThe acting was questionable by all but, most notably the 3 detectives.  Greenly, Duffy, & Dolly were written to be Ã¢??zanyÃ¢?? and was a pain to watch.  At times I felt that I was watching a Ã¢??fan filmÃ¢?? of the first movie.  LetÃ¢??s just say that I wasnÃ¢??t sad when the most annoying one got plugged.  Ã¢??thanksÃ¢?? for showing up!Ã¢??.  Special Agent Eunice (Julie Benz) was portrayed as this amazingly hot chick detective and they were pretty blatant about it.  SheÃ¢??s good looking and all but, the way the character was portrayed was pretty annoying.  I donÃ¢??t blame Benz at all though.  She has been in many TV series that IÃ¢??ve seen her in as well as Punisher: War Zone.  LetÃ¢??s just say she was hampered by the script.  Doc (Gerard Parks) should have been left out in this sequel of crap.  He is getting way to old to be hitting his marks.  I wasnÃ¢??t convinced at all that he actually had a stutter.  It was pretty sad.  I was afraid he was gonna get broke.  On the whole, the casting must have been handled by a homeless person because I was never able to buy Judd Nelson as a Italian crime boss nor could I stand Peter Fonda playing an old Italian man.  I mentioned Punisher: War Zone earlier and I felt that Judd was channeling Jigsaw at times and that was a mistake.  Horrible.  Judd Nelson, what has happened to you?  Oh, by the way the sausage hit that man in the chest but yet he had on headgear?  Horrible.\n\nVillains.  Bad Guys.  Antagonist(s).  Well, no matter how many words you got this movie had it all.  In fact it had a 3 tier system.  I donÃ¢??t understand why their needed to be the focused effort on the first bad guy and how much he hated to be short.  I can understand a couple references to this but they actually filmed scenes where this was the focus.  Much like a video game, once the level boss was defeated you moved on to the Act II boss. Lame.  But I already said that.  And then so on until you get to fight the final boss Ã¢??The Italian FondaÃ¢??.  He must have put in his contract that he wouldnÃ¢??t stand at all or make any movements.  Ã¢??I must sit during my whole scene or you donÃ¢??t get none of this!Ã¢??  I will say that he made decent on the accent though.\n\nThe soundtrack is horribly lacking.  It has the 80Ã¢??s hair band sound with a couple of instances when it just cutÃ¢??s off when scenes are changed which feels awkward.  It feels like he hired a garage band to record the music.  What the heck is Ã¢??I want to be balls deep in your loveÃ¢????  The soundtrack shouldnÃ¢??t take you out of the movie like this.\n\nLetÃ¢??s get back to Troy Duffy for our final thoughts.  There was a scene between Gorgeous George and a street level thug that went byJoJo.  The framing had JoJo falling out of frame many times and other times he was just cut off at the chin.  George was tall and JoJo was short so, what should Troy Duffy had done?  Fit them both in the frame!!!  If he would have put time into his actors, soundtrack, casting, framing, pacing, editing, and script then this had the potential to be decent.  The brotherÃ¢??s make this movie as they did before.  ItÃ¢??s just sad that they didnÃ¢??t have the director they needed to take the story to the next level.\n\nOh, and if I didnÃ¢??t mention you actorÃ¢??s that were in this movie.  Feel grateful.  I didnÃ¢??t have a problem with you.  Yes, IÃ¢??m talking to you Ã¢??Incon(spic)uousÃ¢??.  Oh, and Troy, next time take the first ending, you can take the second ending and make another piece of crap with that.\n\nComic Book Movie Plus:  Julie Benz Ã¢?? Punisher: War Zone, Peter Fonda Ã¢?? Ghost Rider, Willem Dafoe Ã¢?? Spider-Man\n\nThere is no \"Bonus\" for nudity in this case.  I didn't need to see the Brothers' asses.  But you girls might...",

The fighting scenes weren't that great when they happened, just super heroic, impossable shootouts that I disliked, and nobody ever reloaded.

The movie doesn't boast great acting and the story isn't complex, but the movie is quite unique and enjoyable. Many compare it to Tarantino's work, and it's obvious it was inspired by it, but I think The Boondock Saints carved something all its own.\n\nThe Boondock Saints II has a lot of good going for it: the brothers are likable and have chemistry together, there is lots of funny (though uneven) dialogue, a great soundtrack, and stylish action sequences. \n\nDuffy did a great job of duplicating what what successful in The Boondock Saints, yet didn't stick to it religiously (this isn't a Hangover/Hangover 2 situation) There is obvious mirroring going on with the inclusion of a sidekick, the overly-dramatic special agent, etc. but it wasn't overly distracting.\n\nI think the introduction of a secondary plot involving Poppa M's backstory was pretty cool. Again, the acting and plot is isn't very strong, but it's passable. I really think Duffy improved his directing int this. Benz, rather than Dafoe, is the main reason this movie isn't as good as the original. Benz character is VERY annoying.\n\nI love that it makes several references to the original, even bring back Rocco in a dream sequence. I also really liked Romeo. It will be fun to see if they carry out the formula they have established so far in the franchise and added another sidekick in the sequel. \n\nIn all, I definitely recommend, especially if you (unlike the critics) enjoyed the original.

While the film retains some trademark Boondock action scenes, there's little else here of value. The characters are flat, the writing is horrendous, the pacing is lacking, and the film just tries far too hard to live up to its predecessor and ultimately falls flat on its face with practically every frame. Indeed, All Saints Day literally wears out its welcome before the first 15 or so minutes, and it's unfortunately one of the lesser movies of 2009 and one of the worst \"most anticipated sequels\" in generations.",

            "content": "No where near as compelling as the first or as well written.  I should say that about the first half.  The second half of the movie though definitely keeps you interested though and reminds you why you are taking the time to watch this thing.  First half of the movie definitely feels like a movie written by a white trash, cocky, disrespectful, juvenile minded person that Duffy is.  The second half though seems to be a flash of the rare brilliance that overwhelmed Duffy while he wrote the first movie.  So again first half is ridiculously horrible, second half is a whole different movie more on par with the first.  Rumors of a 3rd are being floated around and supposedly it is actually in the development stage.  The fact that the second one sucked halfway through though and only the second half was worth watching I can't help but feel the 3rd one will be an entire film of crap.  Duffy is toxic in Hollywood because he is so full of himself but yet acts like your typical Boston teenage trash.... too bad he is in his 40s though.  Mark Whalberg used to be the same punk but he soon realized if he wanted a career he had to stop acting like a douche bag punk.  He cleaned up his act, started respecting people and now is an A list celeb.  I haven't heard anything on the Duffy front in several years but I can imagine he is the same immature punk he has been in the past.  Until I hear otherwise that is the truth.  He was a bartender when he got a deal from Miramax to do BDS 1, his head inflated 100 fold.  He acted like he was hot sh** in hollywood.  Would show up to meetings wearing bibs and drunk/hungover from the night before.  he respects no one in Hollywood and as a result Miramax had enough and pulled out of their deal.  No one wanted to touch the boondock saints because of Duffy's juvenile punk personality.  That is why no one heard of the boondock saints until a few years after it hit theaters.  It hardly hit theaters from what I hear.  Something like 5 theaters for 1 week is all it was out for.  It took word of mouth from DVD sales until people started praising it and finally reached cult status.  It's box office take was in the thousands, DVD sales.... $50 mil+.  You'd think a movie that did that well in DVD sales would have production companies chomping at the bit to give duffy a deal to make the second one..... nope.  It to was limited release because no one wanted to work with the childish Duffy.  Granted it made $11+ mil at the box office, it too grossed most of its profit from DVD sales, I think $60 mil or so.  Duffy is the prime example of what not to do when given a chance to actually live out your dreams.  Instead of being grateful he acted like he was too good for Hollywood before he even made a dent in Hollywood.  Instead of focusing on his movie and networking with higher ups or even his peers in Hollywood he just drank at bars with his low life friends.  Networking is the key to success, talent is secondary.  Had Duffy not act like an a** when he got his first deal, which eventually was taken back, and networked within the Hollywood community and studied his craft Saints 2 could've been a lot better.  He could've gotten professional help writing the movie which i think would've made Saints 2 so much better.  Heck, if he showed respect when he got the deal for Boondock Saints 1 Miramax probably would've stayed onboard and that would mean a wide release for the film.  I think Saints 1 could've grossed $100+ mil at the box office had Miramax stayed on, and Duffy would probably actually be a name in Hollywood and he would've followed a similar path that Robert Rodriguez took.  Instead he let his head get too big and as a result few people in HW want to deal with his immaturity and arrogance.  That is why BDS 2 was a noticeable blunder.  In the writing alone you can see Duffy knew how he wanted the climax and resolution to be.  He had no clue though on how to set it up for the first 40 minutes of the movie which is why most of the first half is so pointless and laughably bad.",

It was great that director Troy Duffy brought back a lot of the actors from the first one. Like David Ferry (Dolly), Brian Mahoney (Duffy), Bob Marley (Greenly), Gerard Parks (Doc), and David Della Rocco. And as for the new characters: Clifton Collins Jr. (Star Trek) as the wild and sensitive Mexican sidekick Romeo, Julie Benz (Rambo) as the southern and Smeckerâs FBI replacement Eunice Bloom, Judd Nelson (The Breakfast Club) as Don Yakavettaâs son Concezio, and Peter Fonda (3:10 to Yuma) as Louie âThe Romanâ were all terrific. I thought Billy Connolly, who returns as âll Duceâ, was a lot better than he was in the first one. I loved the action, the comedy is hysterical, and there were some sad moments, THE BOONDOCK SAINTS II: ALL SAINTS DAY is one of the greatest sequels Iâve ever seen.",

I'm not sure why The MacManus Brothers (who are still fun to watch despite the awful material) would trust this random Mexican guy? Makes no sense, instead of actually trying to make a worthy sequel to the original, he tried to remake the original and failed. Check out the first one, leave this one behind.",

Los actores principales del filme original, Sean Patrick Flanery (Chronicles of the Young Indiana Jones) y Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) regresan, pero como la trama es repetitiva, es muy poco lo que pueden aportar. Aunque me gustó ver a Julie Benz (\"Darla\" en Buffy, the Vampire Slayer) en un papel importante, su personaje es un evidente esfuerzo de repetir la fórmula presentada por Dafoe en el primer filme, y aunque se esmera en dar una buena actuación, la medida con que se mide es muy alta, ya que como comenté en el review del primer filme, Dafoe se jala una soberbia actuación allí, así que tratar de emularlo es muy, pero muy complicado por no decir imposible. Sin embargo, aunque considero que todo el filme es un desperdicio de tiempo, el desenlace sienta la base para una tercera parte que entiendo será filmada en el 2013, y además la escena final guarda sorpresas que no quiero spoilear que al menos me dejaron con un buen sabor de boca al terminar esta patética secuela.",

Boondock 2 is a straight up sequel and suffers from all the problems that most sequels often do.  The biggest one being that director Troy Duffy is a straight up ASS-HOLE.  Strangely, my complaints for this movie seem to coincide with my complaints of Transformers 2.  Too much non sense, it's racist, didn't know if it wanted to be a slap stick comedy or balls out action, etc.  The dialogue is so hokey, and they literally bring back every character, no matter how insignificant, sometimes even if that character died.  Didn't matter to Duffy.  Here's the thing: most characters in the movie are over acting and it sucks balls.  Some of the actors are just over the top, and then it kind of works.  Example: three amateur cops that deliver dialogue like pizza delivered under thirty minutes.  Bullshit.  Clifton Collins Jr. plays the replacement sidekick to the Saints and stands out as ridiculously over the top but never amateur.  Advice?  Cast actual actors next time, and not your loser friends.  Troy Duffy revels in the fact that he's the self proclaimed \"man's man\" that lives life according to John Wayne.  The whole thing's chock full of racial slurs and homophobic remarks.  Duffy's such a douche, but if you loved the first one, there's a couple of dope scenes and shades of funny in there to be mildly entertained.",

When a priest is murdered in a way that frames them, ?the boys? return to Boston to bring justice upon the mob forces responsible.\nBoondock II picks up ten years after the first with the MacManus brothers (Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Redus) living a quiet life on an Irish sheep farm. Back in Boston a priest is killed to bring the brothers out of hiding, unfortunately for those responsible this plan works and the brother return to Boston.\nAll Saints Day employs the same tone as the first with a combination of comedic banter and over the top action; thankfully the production values on the sequel are vastly superior to that of its predecessor.\nOverall All Saints Day has everything a fan of the Original will love, the style of seeing the brothers about to pull off a stylish shootout only to cut to the police and have them explain what happens while the scene is going on is back. They have a new sidekick, this time it?s an over the top Mexican named Romeo played by Clifton Collins Jr to add some comedic levity to the scenes. Billy Connolly?s character II Duce/Poppa Mcmanus is given the Godfather II treatment and we learn how he came to start the family business of killing the wicked. The only drawback to the film is Sean Patrick Flannery looks like he had some plastic surgery done which makes it seem like a different actor is playing his character.\nJust like the original it won?t do much at the box office but will surely find its audience on DVD. How can you not enjoy a movie that includes dialog such as this gem of a line uttered by Murphy Mcmanus (Norman Reedus) before a memorable shootout ?Time for some gratuitous F@*#king Violence?",

Meanwhile, they gain a Mexican buddy to replace Della Rocco, and they are being investigated by yet another FBI agent.\n\nIt was nice that they got some characters from the original back and retained their chemistry. This is probably the best thing about this follow-up. As time passed, it has more style applied to it in nearly every facet. The gunfights got cooler, the visuals got sleeker, etc. And the actors really try to work with it as much as they can.\n\nHowever, a more emphatic style is unable to hide its lack of substance or, better yet, the fact that it's a clone of the original. It reminds us why we watch the original because the original did it so much better. Frankly, this sequel's attempts in emulation backfire upon itself because this makes the movie repetitive and shockingly dull to sit through. The style makes this feel overdone. For a wait as long as this, the filmmakers could've done much better.\n\nMoral of the story: What was cool, fun, and fresh in 1999 is not so much nowadays.

BUT when you're working with something as amazing as The Boondock Saints as your foundation it's hard. And this is not to say it's a bad movie. Far from it. You just get more of the same equation. Styleized shoot 'em up violence, quick catchy vulgar dialouge, and replays of the action during the police investigation. Old characters are reprised by all the actors. With the addition of hottie Julie Benz, Cliftion Collins Jr, Judd Nelson and acting legend Peter Fonda. You even get a back story on El Duce and quite the open ending for a 3rd installment. Hopefully it won't take another 10 years to get there. If you loved the 1st you won't be disappointed. If you hated the 1st you're just getting more of the same and wouldn't be interested in it anyway. I loved it and plan on buying.",
