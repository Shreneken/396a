It could have used an extra 20 mins or so to wrap up Sam's character and show us what happens to him after the events of the film. If you like Space films you may enjoy this but from the hype this film gets I expected abit more from it.",

The lead character falls flat in a couple of key ways, and the movie misses opportunities to get us really invested in him and any kind of growth or journey he might be going on.

In fact, I had never even heard of Duncan Jones' Moon and am immediately attracted to anything that includes Sam Rockwell. For this reason, I'm going to refrain from spoilers because although the film is from 2009, I suspect many have not seen it and would be to their detriment if I gave anything away. Therefore, all I can say about the film is that it concerns one of my favorite topics \u2014 the value of human life in the future. I wouldn't call this a dystopian film, as we see very little of day-to-day life on Earth, but one could project a bleak vision of the future from how Lunar Industries, one major corporation, treats their labor. That being said, perhaps Lunar Industries and their ability to harvest a new energy resource away from Earth, has completely reshaped society and Sam's (Rockwell) existence is the hypothetic cracked egg that makes the global omelet. GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey, feels like a rudimentary TARS from Interstellar. Its emoji faces are a nice touch and his existence not as a \"technology is evil\" trope was an important part of the plot. The film is scored really well. When Sam calls home and his daughter answers\u2026 oh boy. Moon is a slow burn. This is not an action-packed thriller, but one of the psychological and commentary variety. It wasn't what I was expecting, but is something I'm glad exists.",

The struggle feels like how someone would react to the situation, and Rockwell adds his own special flair to it.\n\nThe setting of Luna is amazing, granted it's mostly in the small station, but it makes me jealous that we haven't established moon colonies.  Space madness might be a real thing, but it is because someone is alone and not part of a group.\n\nI want more movies like this for every reason: more Sam Rockwell, more Luna settings, more clone movies, more isolation theory, more, \"OMG, MY ENTIRE LIFE IS A LIE, WHAT IS HAPPENING!\".",

Rather than focusing on the character escaping, Sam Rockwell's character knows he's going to escape\u2026 until he doesn't. When it's revealed that Sam Rockwell had all the clones of himself, I was captivated. This shift in the plot immediately made the film much more interesting, but it did seem slightly too early in the overall plot. Which was my problem with Moon, everything was either too predictable, or too early in the film to keep the suspense going for the entire time. That's what I have felt on this movie for a long while, however, it did recently occur to me that that's kind of the point. Moon isn't meant to be like other science fiction films. This isn't about shooting things with lasers or explosions, really, it's about rich characters being forced to deal with one another. Being that he had to pull off so much, Sam Rockwell truly gave a brilliant performance as Sam in this movie. The interesting thing is that there are almost no other actors, Same Rockwell makes the entire movie work, and I give him props for that. I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of this movie, the pacing and the interactions all worked so well. But that last quarter is really my problem. Moon seemed like it should have had some huge twist at the end, revealing something that shook the plot of the movie, but it didn't. Everything the majority of the movie was leading to kind of fell apart here. While there was some emotion at the end, it just wasn't enough. I suppose I may have been putting this film up to high expectations due to how much I liked the first three acts, but the ending just didn't work for me. Overall, I truly enjoyed the creative take this movie had, but I just couldn't help but feel that it was missing something.",

The finale we do get isn't bad, but it was a little unsatisfying for my taste, and came off as a little rushed.  Not a bad debut overall though for director Duncan Jones.",

His only companion is a support A.I. named GERTY, who runs everything behind the scenes in their space station. He occupies his time gardening and building miniatures to keep his sanity, for he hasn't seen another human being in those three years.\n\nSam Rockwell deserves high praise for his role as Sam Bell. He expertly weaves this portrayal of a man who's love for his wife and daughter are the only things carrying him through his last few days in space, as he slowly begins to have a personal crisis.\n\n\nDuncan Jone's directing also coincides excellently with Sam's character. Using an abundance of beautifully framed wide shots, the movie makes you, personally, feel lonely. Which in return, helps you empathize and relate to Sam even more. \nDuncan's talent is further displayed when Sam's perspective may no longer be the most accurate narrator. As the movie progresses, events happen and you are unsure of what is reality and what may be signs of Sam descending into madness. And while the movie loses some steam around the beginning of the third-act, and at times can feel fairly-joyless, Duncan is mostly clear in his directing, and his answers to your questions are satisfying, even at the expense of some abandoned ideas.\n\nWithout giving away too much of the film, Moon's specific plot beats and scenarios work excellently as \"Hard\" science-fiction. The corrupt use of resources and advancements in technology that push nature's ethical boundaries is a very possible and accurate portrayal of mankind's selfish ambitions.\n\nI highly recommend this film to all science-fiction fans, as well as cinephiles.\nMoon breathes new life into the space-claustrophobia genre in a Hitch-Cockian psychologically thrilling character study. As well as having a diverse performance from Sam Rockwell, all while exploring themes and commentary on individualism and personal worth. \n B+",

            "content": "This movie is a unique offering in the Science fiction genre. Unlike other movies in the same genre, it does not rely solely upon the visuals and action. Rather, it dives deeper into human emotions and values. The anticipation, the loneliness and the insanity one suffer upon knowing the realities are highlighted in this movie.\n\nThe Plot: An astronaut, on a 3 years mission to stay on Moon, harvest the Helium 3 and send it back to earth to produce clean energy. Right from the start, you will start to absorb the loneliness he suffers. To accompany him is an AI machine GERTY. You will definitely start to draw parallels between him and the HAL-9000 from 2001 A Space Odyssey. Once the premise is established, you will be introduced to some weird things happening and will soon realize that what you see and believe is not true. The director made great attempts to immerse you in his narrative, yet letting your mind wander in possibilities, only to realize that you might be wrong. For further in-depth review, read the spoilers version.\n\nThe acting is amazing. Sam Rockwell gave one of his best performances in years. Kevin Spacey as decent enough for GERTY, the AI.\n\nThe visuals were great. The story is gripping. The cinematography worked hard to show the spectacles of the space and shone in few of the shots. A must watch for those who believe that space movies can not just be about aliens and battles.\n\n**Spoilers ahead*** \nSo, one of the important topics explored by this film is the Identity. You believe that you are unique. You have your own identity. But what if I introduce you two someone who is exactly you, not just appearance, but also all the memories, character and emotions. Then who is the real you?\n\nSam Bell (Played by Sam Rockwell), met an accident on moon and later rescued by someone who is exactly the same person, Sam Bell. Later we found that the Sam Bells are all clone of the original Sam Bell who died a while back. The AI Gerty knows this. And you will start to think him as yet another HAL-9000, evil AI fiddling with humans. But no. He turned out to be a good AI, there to keep an eye on the clones. He not only revealed the reality to Sam, but also helped him to get back to earth.\n\nThis is a nice example of subverting expectations. You are introduced to space and an AI companion and you made an image of the character and expects things to go wrong.\n\nAnother really good thing is how casual the reactions of the characters are. Upon realizing that you are a clone, one would go mad. But here, the clones seemed more calm. Maybe they already know about the cloning process and might have heard similar stories of people finding out they are clones. Instead of denying the reality, they start to acknowledge it and move on. This explain how the technologies we fear now, can be a casual thing in the future.\n\nFinally, another thing highlighted in this movie is the cruelty of the Corporations. To forward their cause, they took decisions as sick as making a clone believe he is real and make him work for a reward he can never achieve. They cycle goes on and on. It is satire on the corporations who make false assurances and exploit the people.",

The film also relies on various emotions and a bit of philosophy. An extraordinary combination of sci-fi, thriller, mystery, and psychological includes a one-man performance from Sam Rockwell and Clint Mansell's score as it best. Duncan Jones proves that to make a sci-fi movie, you just don't need a futuristic background to support the genre which is far from being a realist or a lot of budgets but this movie is so difficult to compare in such a movie.

Sam Bell (Rockwell) is a one-person mine operator employed by The Company on the far side of the moon in the year 2035. With a mission plan of three years, Sam is scheduled to return to earth in two weeks. As the time for his departure nears, Sam suffers a catastrophic accident which reveals a deeper, more sinister plan by The Company to keep Sam from ever returning to earth. Writer-director Duncan Jones (Source Code, Warcraft: The Beginning) with writer Nathan Parker craft a terrifying tale which is set, directed and acted like a major motion picture event. Surprisingly, the sole actor to appear onscreen is Sam Rockwell, and the film is even more stunning because of it. All of the set pieces when taken together deliver an effective seventies feel, and the robotic assistant GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey, has a quaint and realistic appearance. Despite its modest budget of 5 million dollars, Moon comes off as a much more expensive film. The real surprise of Moon is not Sam Rockwell's skill in carrying the movie on his sizeable shoulders, nor is it in the effective way dialog is utilized. Moon's greatest achievement is in normalizing dehumanizing behavior by corporations, and in so doing it forces the audience to bear witness to the atrocity. What does it mean to be alive? What responsibilities does mankind have in safeguarding living creatures? Who, or what do we classify as a human being? Moon's answers may shock you, but in our examination of the human condition, life can never be taken for granted. For these reasons, Moon is a cinematic masterpiece: With just a handful of actors, Duncan Jones manages to capture the hidden meaning of our existence - and all we have to do is watch, reflect and learn.

            "content": "Giant Leap for Mankind: Notions of Humanity in Duncan Jones's Moon (2009)\n\nMoon (2009) by Duncan Jones is an unusual sci-fi film. It isn't about super-intelligent robots turning upon men rather men turning in to robots. The film explores the human condition in a world where human worth is determined by economic productivity. It is set in a not so peculiar futuristic era where humans have found a replacement for fossil fuels in the form of a mysterious gas, Helium 3 in the moon. The plot revolves around an astronaut miner Sam Bell who is responsible for harvesting this gas under a three-year contract with a multinational corporation- Lunar. Sam lives on an outpost on the farther side of the moon with his only company being the memories of his earthly life and his own personal robot GERTY.\nThe films chronicles Sam's life on the moon. The audience is exposed to the isolation experienced by the protagonist. This is facilitated by the pristine white machine filled space in which Sam lives in. The still shots capture the monotony of Sam's everyday routine. Surrounded by machines, Sam resembles a machine. Even within this mechanistic confinement, the audience gets to observe the humanity of Sam through his witty humor, his playful interactions with GERTY and his intense longing to get back to his family. Sam becomes a person to be sympathized with. The audience too, longs for Sam to be able to return to earth, to be able to be reunited with his wife and his newborn child whom he so dearly misses. The film does an incredible job of establishing a connection between the audience and the protagonist. Through witnessing Sam's dreams and hallucination, the audience becomes invested in Sam. \n\nThrough Sam the film hints at the human condition in modern society. The age of industrialization we live in is not very different from the futuristic world of the film. It questions the value of the 'human being' in a society where profit and economic productivity are given the utmost importance. In such a society does a person also become a sum of the services he/she can provide or is there more value to human life? The film sheds light on the darker aspects of capitalism and what it intends for the human race. The plot of the film shows how in a purely capitalist world human connections and relationships are just a diversion from the actual purpose of producing economic value. Sam's activities in space which include enjoying music, conversing with GERTY, carving wooden sculptures, even his video talks with his family are actually just means to keep him in a mental state in which he can be most efficient at his work. The aspects of his life other than his work are not essential rather they are distractions necessary to keep him sane. Not because Insanity is harmful for the human psyche but because it is a liability for a capitalist corporation.\nSam's story is one of enlightenment for both the audience and Sam himself. In the beginning of the film, we see Sam as compliant with the corporation's directive. He believes his work on the moon is for the greater good of humanity. With this altruistic motivation he spends day after day carrying out his job. This kind of resembles the lives of people in today's world, who are incognisant to the true motives of huge corporations and try to seek meaning in the work they do through creating a selfless justification for their toil under a system that leaves them with little fulfilment. As the film progresses, the audience witnesses the transformation of Sam, he becomes more and more dissatisfied with his conditions on the moon. He becomes growingly disillusioned with any sort of higher purpose and just can't wait to return home.\nAs his time to return comes closer the film takes an unexpected turn. Sam wakes up after an accident to find in his room a stranger who looks exactly like him. His meeting this strangely familiar new arrival is a turning point in Sam's life. With the arrival of this new Sam, the films atmosphere changes. A previously cold white and silent mood turns more colourful. The lighting becomes warmer to indicate the return of human spirit. The confinement becomes less bleak. The two Sam's start a friendship. As Sam becomes more in touch with his humanity, his anger, his weakness, his fondness of human interaction and love for life, he becomes more aware of the static life he has been leading up to now. Hence through the presence of the other, Sam establishes his own reality. Just like Marx in Capital (1867) - \"It is with man as with commodities. Since he comes into the world neither with a looking glass in his hand, nor as a Fichtean philosopher, to whom 'I am I' is sufficient, man first sees and recognises himself in other men. Peter only establishes his own identity as a man by first comparing himself with Paul as being of like kind. And thereby Paul, just as he stands in his Pauline personality, \nbecomes to Peter the type of the genus homo.\" (19)  Through Sam's consciousness of the true nature of his condition on the moon, the audience too realizes that their roles in the corporate world are not as innocent as they seem. Everything Sam used to believe in turns out to be illusory. It is revealed that Sam is never actually going to return home to earth. The corporation has been deceiving Sam. He is just one amongst thousands of clones created to provide labor for the company's outer space industrial unit. He is dispensable.\n\tThe film brings out oppositions and similarities between machine and human to reiterate the theme of the film. On one hand Sam undergoes a self-realization to come at a conclusion that he is not machine, his inherent spirit and values make him human and that liberates him from being confined inside a robotic life, on the other hand GERTY is a robot who is more human than the humans who run the corporation. GERTY shows compassion and servitude towards Sam and goes on to help him break free from his confinement. This provides a powerful metaphor for men. The film poses a question: In an age where even robots are more humane than humans themselves, does the human spirit hold any distinction?\nThe film through projecting a futuristic dystopia, send out a clear message. The forces of capitalism which are so influential in our lives should not be allowed to overpower the sanctity of our humanity. We as people should resist the pressure of becoming a commodity: simply a cog in the workings of the industrialist machine we call society. As Sam says to GERTY \n\"We're not programmed, we're people\" (1:28:21)\n\n\t\n\nCitations\n\nMarx, Karl, and David McLellan. \"Chapter 1.\"\u00a0Capital (1867). Vol. 1. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2008.

Duncan Jones keeps to the moment and we're never flared up too much.  I like the even pacing.  There's a unique naturalism between the two Sam's, which was unexpected.\n\nHere's a joke within itself: what if Sam Rockwell were stuck in space with himself?  It is about capturing that personality in space which is interesting, that's part of the genius of this film.  He's a modern Americana actor with a familiar sardonic tone that you can imagine would be torture in isolation.  A literal manifestation of another part of himself comes to physical fruition, ouch!  Who knows how many clones there are of Sam?\n\nEvery time we transition from a satellite perspective, we get the feel that Sam is simply out of control.\n\nAt the 50 minute mark, I don't understand why Gerty reveals the truth about Sam's clone.  Perhaps it's protocol, under unlikely circumstances that this meeting should occur, so that both clones are desensitized to their apparent lack of significance.  \n\nLike most of us, Duncan Jones is a director finding the humane within Kubrickian inspiration.  This is a story of self-sacrifice, of rebelling against the constraints of corporate power.  It's optimistic, tugs at the heart, and never becomes as much of a horror as the trailer depicts.",

I expected commentary on global warming, renewable energy, and maybe something on corporate greed. While those ideas are present in Moon what we get is so much better than what I expected. It has been many years since I have seen a sci film that presented so many excellent science fiction ideas to its audience. Any one of the concepts in this film can spawn conversation that last for hours and cumulatively you can talk about Moon for days. Besides 2001 a Space Oddessy I truly struggle to think of a Sci fi flick as engaging as Moon. Beyond those concepts Sam Rockwell preforms brilliantly and the cinematography is superb. A absolute must in my mind. If you are interested in hearing more on the concepts of Moon take a look at my in-depth analysis of the film in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42mo5A984HM",

But that doesn't mean this film is by any means a disaster, it's quite the opposite actually.\n\nLet's start with the positives. Firstly, Sam Rockwell can act, he plays Sam Bell (TOO MANY SAMS) , an astronaut who maintains harvesters on the moon that gives energy back to the earth. His performance, especially as the deteriorating version of himself, plays out like an absolute fever dream. It's pretty damn excellent. The soundtrack to this film is wonderful. Combining a somber piano tune with the mysteries scattered in the movie. The atmosphere is cold, simplistic, but cold. Which I guess capitalises on the colour scheme of the movie itself, black and white. GERTY, played by Kevin Spacey, is a big help (maybe top much of a help as I'll explain later). The cinematography and stage design are all on par. But Moon has plenty of wafer-thin plot devices that unfortunately drag it down.\n\nThe emotional connection between Sam and his daughter, through his perspective is absolutely harrowing, but through the audiences eyes I feel as if Duncan Jones could've done more visually to interpret his mental breakdown as a clone. The dramatic elements of this movie, whilst mysterious, are unfortunately uneventful for the most part. Yes, there is somewhat of a 'big reveal', but it's bought down by how explained it is. A robotic giveaway by GERTY. Sam's illness could've been highlighted a bit more, there is some gross signs of his body whittling away at itself, but mentally I feel like instead of maybe using a metaphor which is also grounded in reality, Duncan Jones could've utilised the 'perception vs reality' concept hinted at around the time Sam pours boiling water on himself.\n\nIn what could've been a fever dream of ambiguity, Moon is sadly not the cold chilling film it could've been. There are some great moments of brokenness, but the character's motivation and reaction to the essential thinly advertised twist of the whole movie is done exceedingly poorly. Still, Moon isn't a disaster and it's very well made in terms of atmosphere. It's just everything else is a bit meh, in an attempt to compensate for lack of ideas to do with the harshness of isolation, especially in a cruel environment like space.\n\nB-\n\n62/100",

Big companies exploit, big governments exploit, humans exploit other humans, that's it.

With a smart but spare script, an intriguing and constantly evolving storyline and a gripping central performance, watching Moon is a truly wonderful experience, and one I'm sure to enjoy many more times in the future.",

The story is about an astronaut who was sent to the Moon for 3 years to supervise the project of collecting the power of the Moon, or something like that (I don't remember fully because I saw it last month, just didn't review it then). Things go south once the astronaut has an accident on the Moon's surface involving a vehicle. He wakes up the next day in the infirmary with no memory of anything that happened. Soon he goes out on the surface again only to find his own body in a vehicle. I will not spoil anything that happens from there on, but I'll just say that the ending is very clever and brilliant. The acting was fantastic! Sam Rockwell is great as the astronaut and his character is well developed (you actually care for what happens to him). Kevin Spacey voices a robot that does pretty much everything in the Moon base. The movie looks gorgeous, especially when the outside of the base is seen. All in all, a fantastic movie with a great story, brilliant ending and great performance. I would recommend checking this movie out!",

It may be on NetFlix, but having had a limited run in the theaters through Sony Classics, it barely has recouped it's shoestring budget of $5 million at the box office. Duncan Jones and crew though, have manged to extract every bit of that  budget into making a classic masterpiece that fits nicely in the genre.

Instead, its focus is on the interactions between a human and an artificial intelligence, much like in many sci-fi films from the old days. The acting is really good, but as the film progresses, there tends to be an overdose of shouting, and the film's generally quiet pacing often works against the film itself. The production values, meanwhile, look better than a lot of films made today, and the visual effects are very appealing and fit very well with this movie. Even though a lot of the drama is based on swearing, this film itself does manage to communicate the emotions of its human characters quite effectively. It might not be one of the best sci-fi films out there, but it's certainly one of the most original movies of the last five years, and that's good enough for me.",

In the future mankind is exhausted all its energy resources and energy requirements on earth are fulfilled by synthesizing helium-3 from moon soil. Astronaut Sam Bell works for Lunar Industries and his job is to manage he activities of harvesting helium-3 and send the harvested mineral back to earth at the base named 'Sarang' on the lunar surface. It is explained he is serving a three year contract and currently is almost at the end of his contract. He is badly missing his wife and is mentally deteriorating by loneliness. Live communication with earth is also not possible due to a damaged satellite so he sees only recorded messages from his wife and the employers of lunar industries from earth. A midst all of this, he is accompanied by a computer(similar to HAL-9000 from space odyssey) named GERTY who helps him with the various tasks to be performed everyday and acts a like friendly companion on their base. \n \n Well this the base plot with which the film begins and introduces for about half an hour. But then just as there are few days left for the end of the contract we encounter a confusing twist in the film for which answer gets slowly revealed over the remaining length. Its suspenseful and also has great emotional as well as scientific depth which is a key ingredient for any sci-fi movie.A lot can be discussed about the film as it has pretty much understandable story making it not open for multiple interpretations. But revealing more of it here will destroy the feeling of awe when you watch it first time.\n \nSam Rockwell as the lonely astronaut Sam Base is rock solid and carries the film on his shoulders efficiently. He is the only main character in the film having major screen-time, each of the rest of cast is there for hardly few minutes except GERTY voiced nicely by Kevin Spacey. Despite having a low budget the shots of the lunar landscape were very effective and the sets of the sarang base also looked nice(again inspired by sci-fi epics like space odyssey and alien). There are no great special effects with lasers, blasts or alien creatures just plain simple story of a man on moon filled with deep sci-fi ideas making you think about what will happen if we encounter such situations in real life. This is how science-fiction is enjoyed the best and it is my favorite genre alongside fantasy. The script is tight and focused and doesn't hinder into unnecessary subplots. Duncan Jones and Nathan Parker flawlessly dwell into the depths of the story and debut director Duncan Jones completely absorbs us into the movie making you strongly root for the astronaut.\n\n  The background score is quite nice giving the space feel as required. And even in its short run-time of about 90 minutes it explores a lot. The pace in the first half is bit low which may bore some who are not much into sci-fiction films.Apart from that I did not find a single moment where I got bored. Moon easily gets into my list of best sci-fi movies, it may be inspired but is original in its own way.\n\n[Rating: 4.5/5]",

I just don't get it, and will have to give this one a little bit lower of a review but then again, I did actually like it a lot, so it's a lot better than some of the crap I have had to watch. It's actually a very good movie, a little violent and I don't totally remember it. It was well done and was one of the better ones, even though it was instantly forgettable... Great, tense motion picture with some creepy sci-fi twists. Considered a great movie by the rest of the world, so I will give it a solid 9 out of 10 because I enjoyed it too, even though I don't really remember it and maybe it went over my head with its goodness. I do remember it being very thrilling in the old, epic kind of ways - when movies were mostly visceral and over-the-top (like Jurassic Park or Alien) and weren't totally mind-bending. This was quite a mind-trip though. Very well done and I loved the ending. Plus it was kind of neat in that there was almost no music but it didn't resemble an indie film at all - it was just great storytelling, and lots and lots of fun to watch.",

            "content": "Duncan Jones is a budding director, can't wait to see more from him. Anyways, this review is going to be a bit longer than usual since I feel like writing a legit review. \n\nFirst off, the music. I don't know why, but the music was pretty damn good. The reason why I am unsure why I like it is because its mainly the same tune used over and over, but I think it's extremely fitting since the movie is about *SPOILER ALERTS HAS BEEN ACTIVATED, DON'T READ ON IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE AND HAVEN'T ALREADY!* clones and the repeating cycle of them kind of fits well with the tune. \n\nThe cinematography is good. Nothing special, nothing extreme, but nothing bad either. It's just extremely basic and I haven't seen any sort of style found in Jones' directing either, but that's party because he is a new director (and a promising one). You could definitely tell the limited budget restraints that were to be had on the special effects department. It wasn't terrible, but the rovers and machinery outside the station looked fake. But, this isn't a movie that's about special effects. It's obviously about the story, and the performance. \n\nSam Rockwell is an underrated actor. He isn't the best, but he is definitely underrated and deserves more than what he gets. His performance in this particular film was good. It was what I expected from him and at times, he made me feel sad (but that was mostly due to the plot). He did an exceptional job. Much better than fucking Sandra Bullock in Gravity I can tell you that much. \n\nNow, onto the plot. It's clones. Yup. That's what it is. Now, you might be thinking, \"Fucking cliche bullshit.\" But, sadly, it's pretty original. So, from the top, the film about a resource station on the moon that was built to retrieve Helium 3 from the Sun (Cause rays and shit hits closest on the moon? I don't know, maybe I missed why because of the loud fireworks, which served as a loud distraction to my movie watching, but that seems like it could be done on Earth.) Anyways, a man named Sam Bell has a 3-year contract for a company called Lunatech or some shit. \n\nHe only has about two weeks left on the station, and like a reasonably sane human being, loses a bit of his sanity due to him being alone for so long (But, that won't affect you guys, right? Cause you've been alone all your lives! Hehe...just like me... ); ). And then he begins to see shit (that never comes in to play ever later on in the film, yay plot contrivance!) which causes him to crash his rover on one of his routine runs to collect H3. \n\nNow, Gerty (Hal wannabe) wakes up another clone of Sam Bell. This Sam Bell wants to help and shit, but he can't. By the way, he sees Gerty fucking around with the corporate guys who sent him there. \n\nYou know what...? I'm too lazy right now, you guys can see the movie for yourselves, I don't feel like writing the rest of the story up. I'll just summarize. \n\nBasically, it's about clones of a guy who have a 3-year life span and die, which in turns, activates another clone. They maintain the steady supply of H3 to Earth. Now, the moral is that the corporation is evil for doing this, but I think that they were being smart and resourceful. Also, they won't ruin any family's lives by sending different people up to the moon for 3 years. But, still, it is kinda sad to see a clone that wants to see his wife just to find out he is a clone and he is going to die soon. The end is a happy ending, which I guess, Duncan Jones likes. I still fucking hate the Source Code ending (Not because it was illogical, no quite the contrary, I just thought it would have been perfect to end it at the freeze frame and just not make it a happy ending. Shit. But, that's my personal opinion). This is a good film that I will probably never see again and will forget that I've ever watched it in a couple days. \n\nP.S. It was much better than most recent Sci-fi films. \n\nP.P.S Kevin Spacey was awesome as Gerty \n\n7/10",

Sam Bell is on a solo mission to man the station on the moon which is in charge of mining this compound and shipping it back to Earth. They do an excellent job of showing how this kind of isolation and loneliness can mess with a man's mind. His contract is for a 3-year mission which is nearing completion and then he will be sent home and a new technician will take his place. 3 years is a long time to be alone, and you are given a lot of interesting indications that his mind is starting to play tricks on him. There's a little more going on, but we'll save that for paragraphs 2 and 3 of this review where spoilers will begin. I love the visuals of the moon base. It is white and sterile, yet they have included a padded chair and some other pieces of equipment and furniture in a halfhearted effort to make it comfortable for Sam. The look, sound, and feel of all the base is spot on. I was impressed how I was sucked into the world so quickly. I've seen plenty of films about someone being essentially trapped all alone, but there was something special about the way they portrayed Sam's mission. I think that expectation of going home soon was exactly what he needed to keep a positive attitude and really get the viewers engaged in his story.\n\nSPOILER ALERT! Stop reading now to avoid spoilers... Kevin Spacey is great as the voice of GERTY. He has that robotic tone down that manages to say so much despite the fact that he can't emote properly. His part was well-scripted, and I liked how he basically refused to lie to Sam, but just changed the subject whenever he asked a question GERTY wasn't comfortable answering. But truly, as you might expect, Moon is all about Sam Rockwell. What a remarkable performance! I can only imagine how hard it is to play 2 different copies of the same character, but Rockwell is able to present them as similar but just slightly different. He has a unique way of walking and a variable tone for each version of Sam Bell, and it's unreal that you can tell in a matter of seconds which version of Sam is on screen at any given time (and not just because of the degradation of the first clone we meet.) I like how the clone who has spent 3 years on base has mellowed considerably while the fresh one is still a bit of a hot-head. His boldness in his early awakening state makes the final moments of the film seem very legitimate as we hear he has taken on the Lunar corporation for its use of clones on the moon. It's also fun when they show the older clone schooling the youngster because he has that experience that comes from time spent with nothing to do but practice carving and ping pong.\n\nI'm absolutely amazed how many movies Moon reminded me of while I was watching. Surprisingly, all the movies that came to mind like Oblivion or Robot and Frank were released after Moon. So not only did Duncan Jones do it first, I think he did it so much better. There were lots of little details they included in the script that were so creative and fun to watch. The simple things like how the 2 clones chose different methods of exercise, or the big things like the way they told the clones they had a 3-year contract since that was how long they could live. I also appreciated that they didn't spell out every little detail for us. We can deduce what it means when he finds out his daughter is all grown up, so they didn't have to make Sam verbalize his discovery. This was a well-crafted film that seemingly did everything right. It's not super complex, or deep, but I totally loved it from start to finish. Those final moments when the clock is ticking and Sam has to get out of the station before the team arrives to \"help\" had me on the edge of my seat. I was so engrossed in Sam's final moments and my heart skipped a beat when he delayed his departure to do one more thing.

            "content": "Being a critically acclaimed science fiction film from the creator of Source Code, Moon sounded like an interesting film to check out.\n\nClearly a very 2001: A Space Odyssey influenced film which also takes themes from Silent Running, Moon manages to draw inspiration from some really good entries into science fiction cinema. It tackles a very complex character driven concept in a science fiction setting so that it fits into the context of being a drama with a very strong visual appeal. Moon has all the great visual effects and set design necessary to be convincing in its location, and it does it all on a budget of a mere $5 million which is impressive. Sometimes if you look really closely you can see the ways that director Duncan Jones manages to pull of such trickery using set design and cinematography techniques, but it is still fairly impressive.\nMoon is a memorable science fiction film because it touches upon a theme not covered much in many films of the same genre. The classic 2001: A Space Odyssey was iconic because it posed questions about the mysteries of time and space, and the recent Academy Award winning science fiction film Gravity was iconic simply because it captured the fearful thrill of drifting around in space where nobody can hear you or help you. Moon is iconic simply because of what the protagonist exclaims little over an hour into the film as he sits out on the moon alone and scared. He exclaims \"I wanna go home!\". Science fiction films have become so commercialised in the heroism of taking a journey that they often forget about how the characters have families and would like to return to them alive one day. Moon removes the commercialised story aspects that many films use for science fiction stories and instead strips it back down to the elements of a small scale drama. On a budget if $5 million, Moon manages to put more thought provoking elements into its story than the $120 million romantic comedy How Do You Know? was able to, and still have a lot left over to create an excellent set design combined with quality visual effects. \nMoon has a very simple story to it but touches upon some complex themes of humanity and machinery which comes with its insightful and intelligent screenplay. Riding the strength of Nathan Parker's writing skills and Duncan Jones' fair treatment of the script and the story, Moon comes out as a complex emotional tale which is dramatised excellently thanks to an emotional atmosphere, largely helped by the powerful musical score by Clint Mansell. It is a simple piano beat, but it strikes into the emotional heart of the film with ease.\nAlthough sometimes it feels like Moon doesn't fully take advantage of the complicated high-concept setting it presents, it still does an effective job of telling its story and doing it with passion. Moon is a really thought provoking experience, and it is a testament both to director Duncan Jones' ability to create a complex look at humanity through a science fiction medium and to Sam Rockwell's ability to hold the screen.\nSam Rockwell's lead performance is a complex one, and it is rich with dedicated emotional grit in both his characterisations of protagonists Sam Bell. He manages to incorporate small elements into each character which separate them which is great since a role like his is a very challenging one, and he plays both of them with serious ease and dramatic tension. Sam Rockwell puts dedication into nailing his character from every perspective including his rough line delivery and intense facial gestures which allows him to easily channel his emotions really well and bring them into the tension of the atmosphere nicely. Sam Rockwell holds the screen very well in Moon, and facing an interesting challenge as an actor he tackles the role head on with ease and makes it a successful effort of his. Sam Rockwell is perfect for the lead role in Moon and interacts with the robotic character GERTY and the rest of the science fiction setting with organic acting talent.\nAnd Kevin Spacey's voice acting is excellent because his deep and monotonous voice creates a really artificial sound for the voice of GERTY.\n\nSo Moon has some stiff moments and has a consistently slow pace, but the deep and thought provoking character drama within a complex setting which benefits from a strong screenplay handled by Duncan Jones' skill in filmmaking and Sam Rockwell's strong lead performance.",

            "content": "Moon marks an impressive directorial d\u00e9but from Duncan Jones, who also wrote the story. It presents an intriguing idea, and explores its potential fully. An exploration of a character from two perspectives separated by 3 years of personal growth and reflection. A before and after snapshot of an emotional journey allowed to exist in the same time and place. Sam Rockwell's performance of the two versions of the astronaut Sam Bell is pretty much perfect. The same actor and character, but two entirely different people reflecting the different stages in Sam Bell's life.\n\nMoon also presents a solid science fiction story. A mystery. That begins when Sam finds another version of himself. The two must figure out why they are there together, and why they can't directly contact Earth for help.\n\nConsidering the incredibly small budget, Moon's visual effects are respectable. Thought Duncan Jones wisely keeps most of the movie indoors within the beautifully designed lunar base. The technology on display looks convincing, and the bases robot Gerty is nicely designed. It/he (?) even has a cup holder!\n\nMy only complaint with Moon is the casting of Kevin Spacey. I thought his voice was all wrong for this part and I found it to be a constant distraction. What Gerty needed in my opinion was a flat sounding voice from an unknown actor. At least someone not so recognizable.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis is a low-budget, serious science fiction movie. More 2001: A Space Odyssey, than Star Wars. A thoughtful character study set on the moon. It may seem a little slow at first, but it's worth sticking with.\n\nBest Format:\n\nVisually it's really good. A HD viewing is recommended.\n\nBest moment/element for me: >\n\nWhen Sam Bell makes a call home to his family. Very moving, and very well acted by Sam Rockwell. Also, Clint Mansell's score is superb!\n\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Moon follows fellow astronaut Sam Bell, who is about to complete a solo three-year mission mining for helium on the moon in order to help the Earth during an energy crisis, only to find a clone of him while searching for a crashed rover, leading to questions over who's the real Sam, and why there's a clone of Sam.  Sam also has his robot GERTY to help him and be his companion during the mission, who also follows orders given to him by Sam or the company.  This film gives sci-fi fans something to watch when they're bored or are dying to watch pure sci-fi.  This film shows an interesting concept, moon mining, where the collection of helium-3 takes place.  This also makes people think what could the Moon have that could benefit Earth, and if mining or even colonization could happen there.  But, the real focus later in the film is Sam and the clone, which makes audiences think what's with a clone, and why is there a clone of Sam.  Luckily, the questions are answered, but with shocking complications and results.  Nathan Jones, who wrote the script to follow Duncan Jones' story, is able to keep the story interesting while being able to stay coherent as Sam and the clone desperately search for the answers they desire.  Duncan Jones in his directorial debut, is able to capture the visual look of the film, while also being able to stay focused on what's going during the film.  Garry Shaw also compliments the film's elements while also finding the right camera angles and shots, this giving the scene a unique look.  Clint Marshall is also able to compliment the mood and overall tone of the film by using the right kind of music, ranging from deep and tense, to engaging and revealing.  What also brings this story to life is the incredible performances from Sam Rockwell, Kevin Spacey, and Robin Chalk.  Sam Rockwell gives his best performance to date, capturing the humor, heart, and strength of Sam, while Robin Chalk is able to capture the weak, confused clone with wonder and amazement.  The only non-human performance is Kevin Spacey is GERTY, who shows his serious side, and his outgoing side, giving audiences a machine with human feelings.  What also makes Moon fantastic is the $5 million spent on sets, and the digitally animated models, giving us average yet convincing visual effects.  A must-see, and a jaw dropper for filmgoers.",

The movie is a slow-burning one, but the details are what makes it important. You need to take time to understand it and that is a mark of an intellectual movie.

In Duncan Jonse's low-budget 'Moon' the focus is more on the story rather than the visual aspect, even though the cinematography captures and delivers the director's intention with glorious fashion. Jonse has succeeded to touch on multiple subjects and emotions that will leave you wondering with moral conflicts. Jones has manage to deliver a thought-provocative film that plays a homage to old sci-fi movies such as Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and Riddly Scott's 'Alien'. \n \n'Moon' tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only astronaut who works in a lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from the moon's surface to be sent back to Earth to fuel the planet, a new cleaner solution to Earth's power problems.\n\nSam's isolated three-year mission is about to come to an end and he can't wait to return to Earth to see his wife Tess and daughter Eve. His only company throughout this time period has been GERTY, the base's AI robot (voice by Kevin Spacey) and kind of Sam's personal assistant and best friend. Sadly, the last days are proving to be the worst, and after experiencing a bizarre encounter (which I wont get into details) both Sam and the audience are left questioning wether it is all really happening or is it inside Sam's mind.  \n\nSam Rockwell delivers an outstanding performance in this one-man-show and proves he is capable of playing such role. the constant flashbacks Sam has had to his life on earth and his whole approach to the situation were, in my opinion, very human-like.  \n\nThis film stretches the boundary between sci-fi and art and redefines the words 'isolation' and 'lonely',I would strongly recommend every sci-fi lover, every drama-lover and even every Charlie Kaufman-lover to see this film.",

            "content": "Duncan Jones, the director of Source Code and the upcoming Warcraft, is one of the more promising upcoming directors.  And it shows a lot in Moon, a prime example that a sci fi film can be compelling without any form of destruction or mayhem going on.  Most sci fi films would include aliens, or explosions or anything to show off the technical prowess of today's technology.  However, Moon doesn't rely on any of that and just shows off how a simple story can be elevate off of pure acting talent.  Moon is, in short, a contemporary masterpiece.  Duncan Jones can probably never measure up to this film, due to how nearly perfect it is, and that's not to fault Jones, but to praise this movie.\n\nIn the future, Earth suffers from an energy crisis, bringing the world on it's knees.  However, a new power source, Helium-3 which can be found on the dark side of the moon, can provide the world with enough power to sustain itself.  To harvest this energy, Lunar Industries, the company behind the harvesting project, sends one lone astronaut, Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell), to monitor the system.  Soon, he finds a double of himself, located in a crashed rover.  Afraid and confused, both Sam Bells attempt to find the truth.  The plot is simple, and the film basks in it's simplicity, which makes the film all the more compelling and interesting.  Rather than throwing in aliens or some stupid twist, the film just revolves around it's simple premise.\n\nSam Rockwell (Iron Man 2, Seven Psychopaths) is the base of this movie.  He makes his character more likable, and due to his situation, makes the character much more tragic.  In the hands of a lesser actor, the character could've been easily written off as unlikable or boring, but Rockwell gives his all in this performance.  Kevin Spacey (House of Cards, the Usual Suspects) comes in as the voice actor for GERTY, a Lunar Industries robot who's assigned to help keep Sam safe and secure.  I can't say that Spacey was amazing, mainly cause his voice was one-note through the film, but the character itself was very likable.\n\nClint Mansell's score sets up the atmosphere of this film, giving it a quiet ambiance and dream-like feel.  The set design gives the film a low budget feel, but it adds to the charm of the film.  Duncan Jones is able to set up the film's universe and keeps it fresh and inventive.  Of course, some may complain that the film is more reminiscent of Ridley Scott's Alien, but I find that to be what makes the film even much better.  It harkens back to the 70s style of science fiction, and that's a high praise indeed.\n\nThe film's small scope adds to the film.  Again, this is not a technical marvel, but much more of a psychological thriller.  The character of Sam Bell is very lonely and isolated from the world.  He's unsure whether the double of himself is real or a figment of his imagination, or at least, it seems that way.  Cinematographer Gary Shaw is able to capture the loneliness of the moon, and adds much more to the film than before.  It puts a relatable human feel to a genre which seems to become more alienated with each entry.  \n\nSome minor negatives would include some of the sound and editing, nothing that's a deal breaker, but it feels a little off.  Some scenes are faded out and faded in, making you feel as if you're watching a short film, rather than a feature length movie.  Some of the voice editing is off as well.  Some scenes feel like they happened in two different takes, rather than being seamless.  Of course, I can't fully fault the film on that because the budget restraints do kind of give it a pass.  However, again, it's not a technical masterpiece, but rather a story-driven film.\n\nOverall, Moon is what a lot of films should strive to be: sweet and short.  Nothing more, nothing less.  This is a one-man show, giving Sam Rockwell enough time to ham it up as two characters.  The solid script is enhanced by Duncan Jones' clear direction and makes the film all the more worthwhile.  It captures the silence and isolation of the moon, and it has a human feel to it's story.  The twists and turns this film takes are outstanding and the emotional pull is there.  To compare this to Source Code is like comparing food to water: Can't we just enjoy both?",

It's tough to go into details without spoiling the film, but suffice it to say that things quickly become interesting once Jones has established the tone of the film in the first fifteen minutes. The story is complex, even disturbing, but never falls into the usual sci-fi cliches, and consistently surprises the audience with various twists and turns. This is all anchored by Sam Rockwell's powerhouse performance(s), who really deserves more recognition for creating such a nuanced and realistic character.

On a budget of just $5 million, Jones crafts a beautiful, thought-provoking piece of sci-fi cinema that, refreshingly, doesn't shuffle it's characters under the rug in favor of visuals. In fact, character is front and center here: it's nearly a one-man show as we follow a single astronaut doing his rounds aboard a lunar mining station. That astronaut is Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell), who, alongside a friendly AI named GERTY, discovers a stunning secret. Rockwell is predictably amazing, but this is far and away his best and deepest performance. He manages to bring his trademark sense of dry humor, but also infuses the loneliness and mentally deteriorated nature of a man who has lived in total isolation for three years. Kevin Spacey voices GERTY, and while he's not a truly major character, Spacey brings the character to life in the same way Douglas Rain did with fellow AI Hal 9000.\n\nThe film was produced on just a $5 million budget, as previously stated, but you'd almost never guess it. The visual aesthetic of the lunar base is the perfect blend of sleek white halls and gritty equipment you'd expect from a 2035 space operation. The few instances of heavier visual effects look great, but thankfully, this isn't a film that has to rely on them. The standout of the technical aspects is the score from Clint Mansell. The score is sweeping and majestic when it needs to be, such as during one of the several lunar rover missions, but is also subtle and understated, to match the quiet character moments of Sam Bell.\n\nDuncan Jones has successfully established himself as one of the finest directors working today with just one film. In a time where sci-fi concepts are not explored as deeply as they could be, Jones takes no hesitation in delivering a hard sci-fi tale that also serves as a beautiful, and heartbreaking, character study. This is some of the best indie filmmaking has to offer.",

His work on the Selene moon base has been enlightening the solitude helping him to reflect on the past and overcome some serious anger issues, but the isolation is starting to make Sam uneasy. With only two weeks to go before he begins his journey back to Earth Sam starts feeling strange: he's having inexplicable visions, and hearing impossible sounds. Then, when a routine extraction goes horribly bad it becomes apparent that Lunar hasn't been entirely straight forward with Sam about their plans for replacing him. The new recruit seems strangely familiar, and before Sam returns to Earth he will grapple with the realization that the life he has created may not be entirely his own.

Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut holding down a base on the moon dedicated to harvesting Helium 3. After 3 lengthy years of Sam on his lonesome, he is ready to go home. As his term's end is near, he begins to see things beyond his own comprehension. The film is very mysterious, and never direct with the puzzles through the movie, leaving you to think for yourself. If this movie does one thing well, it's make you think. Not many movies inspired the deep investigation like thinking that Moon did. Although it is an interesting film and concept, the movie moves slow. Not only this, but it's hard to keep things fresh when the film depends on one man to be the entire basis of the film (with exception of GERTY the a.i). Sam Rockwell puts up a solid performance, while Kevin Spacey sounds awesome as GERTY the A.I (similar to HAL from 2001).\n\nIt's thought provoking, but one viewing won't do it for me, as I'd need more views to catch everything and fully understand the concept here. While I thank Duncan Jones for exercising my brain a bit, I'm kind of still left confused. Not only because of the movie's story, but my opinion of the movie as well.",

The visuals are definitely not as interesting as in some other movies of its genre, yet the look is quite an achievement if you consider the small budget.

A well put together, thought out, concise, fresh, and intelligent plot, a mystery that honestly threw me off a couple times, great acting from the leads, great atmosphere, a great score, and beautiful set pieces are what make Moon a movie completely worth seeing. \n\n The story follows one Sam Bell, Played by Sam Rockwell, a miner of precious fuel on a moon base inhabited only by him and and a hyper-intelligent, seemingly self aware, and most intriguing of all, emotion-feeling robot named GERTY (it's not as much of a HAL rip-off as you might think), Played by Kevin Spacey. Sam is nearing the end of his three-year contract with the company he works for, Lunar Industries, and Sam awaits seeing his wife and daughter back on earth. But after Sam is caught in an accident on the base, he starts to realize that everything he's known isn't what it seems... And that's all I'll tell you regarding plot people. You guys gotta go see it for yourselves, because I want to see this movie supported even 4 years after it's release. \n\n\n The acting from Rockwell and Spacey is superb. I could feel the loneliness in Rockwell's delivery, the emptiness that he felt being away from his home so long. Spacey puts life into the lifeless machine he is playing, and will constantly throw you off about his character's alignment. All the small parts in the supporting cast were filled well, and everyone's delivery just served to cement the well drawn out characters. \n\n The atmosphere of this movie is amazing, falling somewhere between 2001: A Space Odyssey, Alien, and Solaris, and being able to take all of the best traits of the three and melding them into a bleak, desolate, isolated, lonely landscape of the giant rock floating seemingly just above our heads. The score, composed by Clint Mansell, who composed titles such as Black Swan and Mass Effect 3 (yeah this guy did the ME3 music), is beautiful, and only serves to add to the aforementioned atmosphere that I love so very very much.\n\n The sets are beautiful, using miniatures rather than CGI for most of the base and vehicles mixed with great shots of the moon with earth in the distance, gives it a very retro yet fascinating look to the entire movie. the indoor sets are some of the best I've ever seen for a sci-fi movie of this type, the moon base actually FEELING like a a base on the moon, and not just a sound stage with some makeup put on. \n\n Overall, this movie is fantastic, a sure sci-fi classic that I wish to see put alongside 2001 and Alien in the future. If you're a latecomer like me, go see this movie folks!",

But they lied, this film is good, but nothing happens in here and some plot elements doesn't look that fresh, they seem to be more like cliches. The one that I mean is about the idea of clones to everything like memory implants etc. Sam Rockwell gives a good performance, but I was promised that it had be something huge and I didn't get that, so I am a bit disappointed. \r\n\r\n       How do you define science fiction? People say that the Spielberg films like Jurassic park and his alien films are good sci-fis, along with the first two Alien films, but where is science in there? There is just fiction and imagination, in that point of view, this film is a success, because it doesn't materialize on fiction, but the science that this film shows you is not that great as well. As for a great Sci-fi film, Spielberg's Minority Report is better than most of his other works, but it is mostly overshadowed by the useless War of the Worlds(2005), a Tom Cruise collaboration which was more successful than the former. \r\n\r\n       I am happy that this film didn't use the usual sci-fi cliche where a robot would be the major villain( here we have Gasky), like from I Robot to the Universal Soldier sequel to the many more such films. This film lacks a focus and even the 1 hour 37 minute duration seems too long because of utter predictability.",

He was honestly robbed of an oscar nomination and, much like the film, doesn't get the credit he deserves. Considering the fact that this was made on a 5 million dollar budget, it blows my mind to see how this is much better than films with 10x the budget this has. Moon is a nonstop, tension filled ride with a well written script. This, along with \"District 9\", were 2 terrific sci-fi's that came out in 2009 and the best of their kind in recent memory. Hopefully in time Moon will develop a bigger following but as it stands, Moon is an incredibly underated sci-fi.

Moon is a film that we have all been waiting for, a film with such great dialogue, and such a great flow of emotions, and such heart-gripping suspense. Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie) really has made a smashing impact. Duncan Jones may become one of the greatest directors of all time through his Hitchcock style of directing and his Scorsese-esque style of emotions.

            "content": "Moon is the rare kind science fiction picture that comes along every once in a while and reminds us that the impact of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is not dead. The hard reality of intelligent science fiction has been replaced by spectacular comic book non-sense pried more from the special effects department then from the gray matter. Here is a movie that, for 99% of its running time, is occupied by one astronaut trying to wrap his head around the most unbelievable circumstance. It is a brainy thriller for that tiny audience still interested in such things.\n\nThe movie stars Sam Rockwell in a very good performance as Sam Bell, a contracted worker for Lunar Industries who has spent the last three years working on the Sarang lunar base where he is in charge of harvesters that send minerals back to earth to be used as cold fusion energy. As we might expect, Sam's three-year hitch is about to come to an end and he is excited about returning to his wife Tess and their now three year-old daughter.\n\nSam spends all of his time alone. His only means of human contact come from transmitted communications from back home, from Tess and occasionally from the execs at Lunar Industries. His onboard helper is an odd machine named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), a bulky machine that follows him around, talks to him in a flat monotone and has facial expressions that appear as emoticons on a tiny screen.\n\nThe description might make Moon sound like just a carbon copy of 2001, but something else is afoot. After Sam crashes his lunar rover into the harvester, he begins seeing things. Things are out of place, not quite right and for reasons we don't quite expect. We might expect that they all have to do with GERTY, that this creepy machine is just HAL with a smiley face, but this movie is anything but predictable as the screenplay offers a cleverly-paced building mystery.\n\nThe trouble with reviewing this film is the danger of revealing too much. To spoil what happens after Sam crashes into that harvester would be an act of cruelty simply because, from the point, the movie never goes where we expect it to go. What is most tantalizing about Moon is the way is builds Sam's predicament, a piece at a time, like a card trick that is only slowly revealed. There are no laser guns here, no lightsabers. no aliens, there aren't even any actions scenes (except a fist-fight that has to be seen to be believed), just a guy in an extremely bizarre circumstance trying to get a handle on the moment.\n\nThis is the first feature from writer-director Duncan Jones who I hope doesn't lose his edge as a screenwriter. His screenplay has the patience and the intelligence to tell the story as it unfolds rather than make everything clear at the beginning. We learn Sam's plight as he does, and it is just as surprising to us as it is to him. Credit should go to the film's production designer who creates the interiors of that space station with its tight corridors and its surgical white walls. We feel as confined as Sam, sharing his claustrophobia and his paranoia.\n\nMoon is one of those little films that you discover and want to tell everyone about. The problem is that, in order to avoid spoiling the surprises, you can't really tell them why. This is one of those movies that incites long conversations afterward about life and death, about the meaning of humanity and what constitutes the qualifications to be a human being.",

Sam Rockwell, (one of the best actors this generation has ever seen) received the Golden Space Needle Best Actor award at SIFF this year for his incredible performance.

Kevin Spacey, as the voice of the robot was a perfect choice, I'm happy he decided to join in the project.  Moon brings back the meat and potatoes-get ready to engage that most sexy of organs, your brain, with some truly succulent brain-food.

            "content": "Moon: Analysis and Review\n\n\tMost science fiction nowadays has a level of shallowness about it; computer imagery has changed the way we look at cinema, for the worst more often than not. However, every so often a film will come along that reminds us of why we love science fiction. Enter Moon, directed by Duncan Jones and starring the always-charming Sam Rockwell. Moon is about a man who works, well, on the moon, harvesting moon gas as an energy source. Having been on the planet for three years, Sam is longing to be with his family. One day while exploring the planet, Sam stumbles upon an accident and discovers.... himself, literally. What follows is an exquisitely made film, which is smart in it's direction and simplistic storytelling.\n\tMoon, like Metropolis and The Twilight Zone, shows man for what it really is - a shallow, depraved creature. But, similar to the pieces mentioned above, Moon also shows man's efforts to cover up it's true nature and to act like it is a perfect, all-powerful force. Not much is said in Moon about Earth's current status beyond that it needs the moon's gas for energy - but this is great because fleshing out Earth would've put the film out of focus on it's main character, Sam. Sam is a simple man, like a man in pursuit of the American Dream, he loves his family and his hobbies. Sam is nothing more than his job, and Sam is very good at that job. The beginning of the film sets up his everyday routine, which in turn causes the viewer to invest in Sam when his routine gets interrupted. Unlike the heroes in Blade Runner and Metropolis, Sam has to confront himself - directly and literally. When Sam finds himself in an accident, he saves him. The two's relationship then becomes the heart of the film. Despite the positive relationship, Sam does very clearly live in a Dystopic world, which is controlled by a corporation that does something horrific in concept, but perfectly in execution.\n\tFrom a religious standpoint, Moon can be seen as a message about man's desire for companionship. Almost all of the motivation for Sam in the film is to get back to Earth and to be with his family. It asks, what would you do in this situation? How would you respond to yourself? What does it mean to be human? God clearly wants us to be in companionship, i.e. with Him and with others - in friendship, and in marriage.  Ironically, in a film focused exclusively on one character that is alone, the message is about companionship and the lengths man will go to get those relationships. Sam wants those things too, however given his circumstances Sam's only real companion is his station's A.I. system, Gerty. \nGerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) is meant to serve as comic relief and as a plea for technology. Nothing about Gerty speaks for a negative viewpoint of technology (unlike Blade Runner and Metropolis which clearly do so), in fact, he is very positive and his actions throughout the film demonstrate that if used right, technology will do what it has always been meant to do - serve mankind. Gerty and Sam have a professional, but entertaining relationship, that is always in its place. Gerty is not some computer that goes beyond his limits - he is no T1000 as in Terminator 2, and he is no R2-D2. But, Gerty isn't meant to be. Gerty is a literal translation of A.I. perfected. And this, along with Sam's motivations and desires, serves the story harmoniously. Sam never takes advantage of Gerty, and Gerty never tries to trick Sam in anyway that would lead Sam to harm.\nMoon is a wonderful, simple little film, which explodes into a thought-provoking character study. It reminds us that the idea of Dystopia is purely a product of man. Gerty is perfect and harmless, even helpful, and unlike Blade Runner and Metroplis, which point at technology as being the root of destruction in society, Moon says the opposite - that man, the creator of technology is the root of evil - the only antagonistic acts in the film come from man itself, in it's desire for wealth, and in it's desire for love. Sam himself proves this point later on in the film, although I don't believe the film has a true antagonist in the purest form of the word. There is no real villain. And that is smart filmmaking, and only enriches the other reasons that I enjoyed this film. \nCoupled with a good bit of humor, and some truly emotional moments, Moon is an interesting unique take on the future of mankind. It's smarter than it seems and its lead delivers a knockout, stand-alone performance. However, I will say Moon is a tad slow at times, which I feel could be seen as an artistic decision; the entire film does take place on the moon after all. \nOverall, what Moon accomplishes best is its message. The message being, that man himself will in someway fail - be it through other men, technology, or himself. Although not a sad film entirely, Moon definitely accomplishes tugging at the heartstrings of an invested viewer. It is an enjoyable time that should be seen at least once, in a quiet room that's a little chilly. That's how you should experience Moon. Science Fiction is at it's best when it effectively sends a message, and Moon does just that. \n4/5 Stars",

Does Sam II die after the end and the passing 3 years? Above all, why does Moon seem to rip off 2001: A Space Odyssey in a few scenes, but with diminished effect?

Moon tells the tale of an astronaut coming to the end of a three year babysitting stint of some mining equipment on the moon before he has an accident and is seemingly replaced by himself.  His only companionship up until this point has been Gerty, a sort of robot butler with the voice of Kevin Spacey.\nMoon delves heavily for the 2001 sci-fi route rather than the Star Wars road and as a result comes out as only marginally more interesting than the greatest of all sci-fi bores, Solaris.  Sam Rockwell is a fine actor, of that there is no doubt.  he was one of the few redeeming features in Iron Man 2 and he plays the perpetual puzzlement of astronaut Sam quite well.\nThe film is really lacking in making us care about what is happening.  The sets and model style outside shots of the mining colony might look fantastic but Moon doesn't really seem to have a heart.  It's the kind of film we all feel like we're supposed to like because we'll look dumb if we don't.  It's a major case of Paul Thomas Anderson syndrome.\nAt just under an hour and a half the film still feels like it's stalling for time.  Ultimately, the film doesn't do anything which hasn't been done in numerous sci-fi films and TV shows before and in a much more entertaining way, which leaves the end result feeling all a little bit pointless.",

Its not action packed there's no bursting aliens its a straight up sci-fi that takes you on an intriguing ride that asks lots of questions about the human nature.\r\n\r\nStarring 'Sam Rockwell' pretty much alone. He plays 'Sam' an astronaut - who maintains the lunar station but he's alone on the moon with no human contact and only a robot 'Bertie' for company. I can't really divulge any more without detailing some clear plot points. Suffice to say there are some intriguing, twisty moments.\r\n\r\nThe story unfolds at a nice place with the first half an hour detailing his monotonous day and how he deals with being on the station. It continues to grow and grow at a perfect pace it doesn't rush into it. Every now and then there's a new element introduced and there's more to think over.\r\n\r\nThe performance moves this film forward because its more or less 'Sam Rockwell' alone for 1hr 37mins he has to give an amazing showing - much like 'Ryan Reynolds' did in 'Buried'. He delivers in abundance, I've always liked him and this just increases my opinion of him.\r\n\r\nOne department that is a bit lacking but by no means finished the film are the sfx. The green screen is a bit off, you can clearly see that it's just an image in the background. Also despite the ending being satisfying it doesn't peak there which is a tad disappointing.\r\n\r\nI wish I watched this when it released in 2009 because it's easily one of my favourite films of that year. 'Sam Rockwell' is superb and the film moves along at a nice smooth pace and proves that true science fiction has more to say than you might expect.",

            "content": "This movie came out in July 2009, during the time when I started to get obsessed with movies realizing that that I am missing out a lot in the world. You know, during the time when Bruno, Harry Potter 6 and Public Enemies were all released? This movie came out around that time. But a lot of people liked this film so much and it begs the question as to why? A lot of shit doesn't happen in this movie and only two well known actors star in this film which are Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey but what was so good about this film? That is why three years later, (well on New Year's Eve) when I watched this movie, finally I understood why. The story is about Sam Bell played by Sam Rockwell who along with his robot GERTY voiced by Kevin Spacey, have been in space for a three-year course to harvest Helium 3 for Lunar. With only two weeks left and hoping to go back to Earth, Sam starts suffering from hallucinations and sees a newer version of himself and they both wonder whether each one is a clone of the other. Now with time running and slowly being driven psychologically mad. Sam realises that his contract isn't the only thing about to expire. The best performance goes to Sam Rockwell who practically carries the whole movie by himself like he's all alone with no one around him except for a few people that are disturbing him which is how his character should be. This movie was dark, intense and psychologically thrilling which is how every movie of that kind should be like. Moon gets a 9/10.",

Because the only viewpoints are subjective, we have no way of knowing why this man made the discovery he shouldn't have. And the house of cards, for me, came tumbling down at that point.\n\nShame, it was a nice house of cards, a visually satisfying film, with one of the best solo performances ever from any actor, from Sam Rockwell, but as a film I prefer Tarkowsky's Solaris, which of course being in Russian, no-one has watched, including apparently, the director of Moon... Otherwise why does he not acknowledge it as the main source?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the film, but the story does not make sense, nor does the time line work with the age of his daughter and the number of, er, others. And as for the \"Jamming\" aerial. Why would they build a working radio and then jam it? Surely it would be easier to build a radio that could be controlled. That made no sense to me at all, but I guess was a tilt to \"They Live\".\n\nConceptually looser than a plate of spaghetti, but stylistically and dramatically a film of rare quality and rivettingly engaging, this is indeed a strange feast!",
