Ponyo longs to become human, and as her friendship with Sosuke grows, she becomes more humanlike. Ponyo's father brings her back to their ocean kingdom, but so strong is Ponyo's wish to live on the surface that she breaks free, and in the process, spills a collection of magical elixirs that endanger Sosuke's village.",

They make a point to have more detail on the adult characters and leave the children a bit more cartoonish which I loved. It makes it very clear the mindsets and tone of each of the characters. Though it is based on the story of The Little Mermaid, it does well to set itself apart from it. The interactions between the two child main characters are very fun and cute from their first interaction throughout this literal \"fish out of water\" story. The movie's score is fantastic and provides a great balance between the humorous and more fantastical elements of the story. The major events that happen during the film are not seen by everyone as very serious which can make it a bit confusing when it comes to the stakes of the film. It also hurts when it is made to be a story of true love between two children when it is not necessary. They just as well could have just been an enduring friendship and demonstrate the bond of loyalty and love on something other than a romantic level.",

Small criticism aside, the animation is exquisite, typical Miyazaki really- Ethereal colours, beautiful backgrounds and interesting character designs make up the animation here. Another delight was the music, melodious, memorable and of sheer beauty. The script is good too, and I also loved the simple yet magical story and the charming characters especially the very sweet protagonist. The voice acting is top notch too, it is quite emotive and never feels bland. In conclusion, really quite charming and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Many characters accepted the fantastical nature of the happenings around them too easily for me. The English dub cast is stacked with talent and they do a good job. The score has moments of epicness that I really enjoyed and the song played over the end credits was catchy. If you enjoy Studio Ghibli films, then this is worth checking out.",

            "content": "Adorable anime for children of all ages.\n\nHayao Miyazaki directs his family comedy anime Ponyo (2008) is perfect for kids that need some dreamy entertainment. Studio Ghibli's hand drawn animation is as vibrant and alive as ever with Ponyo. Every splash of a puddle or crash of an ocean wave feels majestic and lovingly crafted by these Japanese master animators. Miyazaki's direction is swift and sure with a clear focus on making every fish as cute as possible and every moment with Ponyo an infectious revelry. Miyazaki never lost his creative edge or passion for directing as Ponyo proves with its endearing sweetness and effortless charm.\n\nFurthermore, Miyazaki's love of nature continues with Ponyo as it is a cute little romantic comedy with a boy who falls in love with a little girl mermaid, but it's also about humanity polluting the ocean waters with garbage. Ponyo's father only hates humans because of our desecrating the seas with trash and you really feel for him. Miyazaki's writing also bears this warm familial bond between fathers and their daughters as well as mothers and their sons. Miyazaki's writing never fails to provide a strong female lead in his daring heroine Ponyo with her resolute convictions. Ponyo is Miyazaki's love letter to close families, good parenting, and fast friendship all through the eyes of the innocent.\n\nPonyo may turn off some dour, loveless, jaded adults, who beg Hayao Miyazaki for a mature and sensible anime film, but for those desiring a fun sea adventure feature, Ponyo delivers. It's one of the most adorable movies I've ever seen with radiant colors and lighting, flowing water animation, and a plethora of sea life to look at in the background. Studio Ghibli's animators breathe life into a vast array of fish with funny aquatic designs that rival the cute character designs. Ponyo's underwater wizard father Fujimoto looks so cool and memorable, that his image has stayed with me. Liam Neeson's voice is stern and fatherly, but also has a tenderly vulnerable side that only Neeson could voice with such sincerity. Neeson sounds like he had a blast voicing Ponyo's concerned dad Fujimoto. Liam Neeson is my favorite aspect of Ponyo. He makes a great water wizard to be sure.\n\nHayao Miyazaki and Takeshi Seyama's editing is intricately cut between Ponyo's seaside adventures on land and her father's worries on the ocean floor. Their quick cuts allow Ponyo to breathe gently in each scene that you get to know her and have fun, while never dragging. Ponyo is a very fast 100 minutes of playful whimsy.\n\nAtsushi Okui's cinematography is lovely with pleasant wide shots of breathtaking ocean views and seaside vistas. His medium shots of people are quite charming. I'm glad Hayao Miyazaki keeps using Okui for his keen eye for cute animated shots and clever framing. Noboru Yoshida's art direction is really neat for Ponyo as the film has this traditional Japanese animation for certain schools of fish, while blending into watery chaos for other styles and moments within Ponyo. Ghibli went ultra creative with Ponyo's visual appearance and watery imagery.\n\nJoe Hisaishi's delightful score is upbeat and brilliant. His cheery music contributes an energy and vivid dynamic to Ponyo's treacherous adventures in the ocean with dreamy melodies for gentle playtime to soaring exuberance for Ponyo's whimsical aquatic nonsense. Joe Hisaishi is a genius film composer. His symphonies cuddle with Ponyo's delirious atmosphere of careless joy and childlike wonder.\n\nNoah Cyrus' excitable and innocent voice for Ponyo herself is probably the peak of her career. She's commanding, surreal, silly, and sincere all in one vocal performance. Her intense playfulness gives Ponyo a real personality. She has erratic chemistry with the likable Frankie Jonas as young Sosuke, the boy who saves Ponyo from a tiny jar. Tina Fey is excellent and endearing as Sosuke's sympathetic mother Lisa. \n\nMatt Damon is fun and sounds kind as Sosuke's father Koichi. Cate Blanchett cameos as Ponyo's mother and sea goddess Gran Mamere. Cloris Leachman and Betty White cameo as these pleasant elderly ladies with an astute charm of their own.\n\nIn conclusion, I know it may seem childish to love Ponyo, but Ponyo is so easy going and affectionate that I cannot help but adore this movie. I loved Ponyo when it released back in 2008 and it holds up beautifully.",

Probably more beloved by critics and animation experts, Ponyo only wows if you have a taste for efforts pushing the boundary of narrative in ways only animation can.  Standout features for me:\n- A rare positive and explicit evocation of the Divine Feminine in Ponyo's mother,\n- A fluid childlike art style perfectly suited to animating hundreds of watery scenes,\n- The creepiness of a fairy enticed to become human thru human blood is neither ignored nor exploited,\n- The supporting nursing home characters evolve suprisingly. \nAdroit in multiple ways Ponyo is an animated wonder. \nPonyo (also known as Ponyo on the Cliff) (2008)",

Don't get me wrong, the film is beautifully animated and very much enjoyable, but it often feels like it's more style over substance, failing to explore any mature theme in depth like many other Ghibli greats. For instance, the treatment of the tsunami, a major plot device, is surprisingly lighthearted given Japan's rather devastating history in this context; this film probably couldn't have been released a few years later, following the extreme loss of life in 2011. Lacking a sense of sincerity and gravitas, Ponyo feels almost sickly sweet at times, but even pure sugar tastes good for the first few minutes. Overall, still entertaining, but not without weaknesses. (4/5)",

Set in a small port town, Ponyo is the tale of an independent young boy, effectively living in a single-parent household with his father continually at sea, who discovers an odd creature with shifting human features at the water's edge. In Hayao Miyazaki's hands, the ocean is a wild, vibrant collection of churning life, and its residents (particularly that one determined, shape-shifting fish) an irresistible, elemental force of passion and curiosity. It's alive and adorable, though not something to be taken lightly, as we discover when a raging storm hammers the coast and floods our little town. Generally quiet, low-key and contemplative, it's a much smaller journey than enveloping masterpieces like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. Ghibli's earlier works are a better comparison, particularly My Neighbor Totoro which deals with many similar moods and themes in a forest environment. A small-scale, feel-good film that's an excellent opportunity to shut down the critical mind and give in to the sense of childish wonder that permeates Ghibli's best scenes, though not quite the sweeping epic that the studio's become known for of late.",

'Ponyo' seems to be made with a much younger audience in mind which, for me, made it slightly less enjoyable than some of Miyazaki's other work geared towards somewhat older viewers, but there's no denying that it's a beautiful and magical hand-drawn film with a very sweet story and, as with most of Miyazaki's work, an important message to deliver. Another lovely entry into the iconic director's filmography.",

That kids mother drives like a freaking mad man.\n\nIt's so lovely to see a little girl who has powers put it to good use by helping out others. Ponyo's mother is beautiful, a true goddess. Such a goodhearted and sweet movie. \n\nThough the story is not as filling as other Miyazaki films, it's a very genuine one and a sweet one. The characters in this movie all have goodhearted intentions and are easily likable. It's a very cute movie, definitely Miyazaki's most children oriented movie. \n\nThe visuals were really eye catching and beautiful. You can really see his love for the colors blue and green. All the sea creatures were so intersting to watch. There were some that looked really ominous and creepy.\n\nOverall, wonderful movie with captivating visuals. So beautiful that they make me want to be there in that little village.",

Ponyo is more than our Little Mermaid of fairytale fame - she's determined, powerful and kind of sweet in a weird, yelling, blobby sort of way. However she suffers from the usual Ghibli flaw - the weak final act where the tone settles down and never manages to pick up again. Character motivations dwindle and suddenly very little makes sense but everyone seems to be ok with it. Also, while the environmental message is not without credit, it's ineffective and heavy handed to the point of preachy coming from one character only. Mononoke-Hime did a much better job.",

The story is not epic, instead we get a simple lovely story. Visually, Ponyo wowed me in the same way Howl's Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke, and Laputa: Castle in the Sky did to me.
