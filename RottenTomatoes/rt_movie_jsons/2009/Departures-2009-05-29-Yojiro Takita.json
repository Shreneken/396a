    "summary": "Soon after buying an expensive cello, Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) learns that his orchestra is disbanding. Daigo and his wife move back to his hometown in northern Japan, where he answers an ad for what he thinks is a travel agency but is, in actuality, a mortuary. As he learns and carries out the rituals used in preparing the dead for their final rest, Daigo finds his true calling in life.",

            "content": "In returning back where he came from, Daigo Kabayashi is as lost as Professor David Lurie from J. M. Coetzee's novel, Disgrace (1999). One might argue that the Professor is responsible for his own disgraceful homecoming, but such a person would have to be reminded of fate's brutality, that what the leg that will be broken will be broken. There is no more escape for the professor than there is for Daigo, a cellist who has to go back home when his orchestra is disbanded, even before he has paid off the expensive cello he just got. The thing that connects these two so strongly is the new \"vocations\" each one finds in his own wasted dreams: the professor has his sick dogs, and we're not so sure he cares that much about his work on Byron. Daigo finds his dead, and the cello is now just a hobby. And perhaps because he doesn't care about an audience anymore, he becomes an artist by departing from that stiff professionalism that had driven him to buty the expensive cello in the first place. In a way, his new \"art\" is the key to that childish fascination that is the mark of the true artist, and with the audience gone so goes the cares and so enters the true artist. Yet in this great transfomation, or metamorphosis, is weaved the metamorphoses of others, so that the movie is more than a portrait. It is a symphonic masterpiece, and Daigo is happy if happiness exist, even though the path to that happiness has wiped the smile perhaps entirely from his face.\nAt the end, I thought I saw in his cheeckbones the cheekbones of Kafka, but that might be an optical illusion. They do look alike if you ask me.",

Unbeknownst to his wife, he accepts a position that involves preparing the deceased for their final departure, leading him to reevaluate his life and, perhaps more importantly, his relationships with those around him.  Departures is a languid, meditative film, meticulously directed and beautifully shot \u2013 every shot is perfectly framed and expertly blocked.  The characters all resonate in some way, regardless of their views on Daigo's profession or their own responses to death.  It is a moving and impactful film that, despite the subject matter, is never overly sentimental or maudlin.",

            "content": "About 30 years ago, I learned of the taboo nature of the subject of disposing of the dead in Japan from Masato, my favorite sushi chef. I finally got him to rent director Juzo Itami's \"Tampopo,\" which remains one of my favorite films of all time, and I assumed that he would also love it (especially since he was involved in the food industry himself). Instead, while he said that he thought it was very funny, he'd found Itami's \"The Funeral\" (which I had also seen and enjoyed, though not nearly as much) to be much funnier because to even talk about things like the details of a funeral, e.g., the costs of the different casket options, let alone joke about them, was just something that you didn't do in Japan. I later learned that even to this day, if you are a male from some areas of Tokyo or have one of certain surnames, and start to date a woman, her parents may hire a private investigator to see if your family was in the business, which would disqualify you as son-in-law material.\n\nI think that you should understand this to truly appreciate what the main character is going through when he takes the job that he stumbles into, and why he can't tell his wife or anyone else that he has. Yet he manages to overcome his internal conflict and see the beauty in the comfort that he helps to bring to the bereaved.",

Tsutomu Yamazaki's portrayal of a Boss who teaches the protagonist is the most fabulous quality of the movie. Actor actually work the role around and inside. Masahiro Motoki and Ry?ko Hirosue are very convincing although camera sometime focused on Ry?ko more then it needed. Her character as a devoted wife is well however it is not explored much.

            "content": "There are many award-winning films out there that I have never seen; not because I don't want to see them, more because I'm not aware of them. This is a case in point; the winner of the 2009 Oscar for best picture in a foreign language, amongst many other awards; it wasn't even released here in the UK until December '09 and even then it had little (or no) publicity behind it. Needless to say, it wasn't until I happened upon it in the TV listings that I became aware of this film. I have to say I was impressed! It had more emotional depth than many western films on a similar subject. Here's a very brief summary before I go deeper into it.\n\nWhen cellist Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) loses his job, he returns to the town where he grew up. Taking his wife, Mika (Ry\u00f4ko Hirosue), with him, they go and stay in his mothers' old house. She had passed away two years previous and had left the house to Daigo. Looking for a job, he sees an advert that looks a little cryptic; something to do with 'Departures'; but still, he rings up and gets an interview. He is employed almost immediately without knowing an awful a lot about what his new career will entail. His new boss, Ikuei Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki), is quite enigmatic but soon all becomes clear. The job is to perform a ceremony for the dead; cleaning and dressing the body, applying make-up and placing them in the coffin. All this is done with great reverence with the departed's friends and family looking on. Daigo soon learns though that this kind of work is frowned upon, but by then he has come to love what he does. How will his wife react and what will he find out about his family now he has returned home?\n\nBeautifully shot with some great exteriors; the landscape take quite a big part in this film. There were some lovely comic moments as well as some quite distressing scenes as the families go through all kinds of emotions as the say goodbye to their loved ones. I'll admit to having found it quite touching at times and even shed a tear or two for my dear departed mum. Of course music plays quite a big part in the film and there are some really touching scenes as Daigo plays his cello out in the fields. I did find, however, that the final act didn't quite have the emotional punch I had expected. Yes, the emotions were there, but it didn't quite hit home the way I anticipated. Even so, it's a film I really enjoyed and one I would happily watch again someday.\n\nSteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 8.2/10\n\nThere are extra bits & pieces (photos, links, trailer and BIGGER PRINT) on my blog at:\nhttp://thoughtsofasteelmonster.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/film-review-departures-2008.html\n\nEnjoy!... :)",

It's never somebody's dream job, but the main character had to give up his musician career playing cello in Tokyo orchestra after it is disbanded. Interesting subject and captivating from the beginning. As you watch people dealing with death and taboo, you learn about life. Very touching and well acted. It is not all a melancholy film, however - there are many funny moments mixed in, to prevent an overly melodramatic feeling. The only negative -if I have to dig- is; it is a little bit predictable at the end. But for me the movie is more about how we feel when we watch it and not too much about how it is done.

Props to Ryoko Hirosue for portraying the wife that any man would want; her smiley, tender and cute personality remarkably resembles that of my girlfriend, with the exception that she would have accepted any job I had taken since the beginning.\n\n76/100",

Departures is a beautiful film about both life and death, and despite having some rather depressing subject matter, it finds time to focus on the happy and funny times in life. I could just end by saying that I think everything about this film is perfection, but the best way I could truly describe Departures is that everything feels alive - even some of the smaller, more inconsequential scenes felt like they had meaning and gave each of the characters a life of their own. The film is darkly humorous, beautifully written, heartfelt, superbly acted, and never once boring despite being more than two hours long. I cannot recall being bored once while I watched this because it was so engaging and mesmerizing to me. For me, Departures is one of the best dramas and best films I've ever seen. There's no question about it, if you love a good film, you must see this one because it is a damn fine film that deserves more attention.",

Yes it's simple, yet predictable in many places.\r\n\r\nThis contradictory feeling may come out of its witty execution dealling with an intense issue (death and propably life) that could have been handelled through an overly dramatic way, but what really fascinating is being crafted in such light heartedly way.\r\n\r\nThe first part has its reasonable share of humor but not slapstick comedy, then it deepens gradually to have its moving and emotional scenes supported by such a great sentimental score. Cinematography is also great and has its impact on dilevering the scenes.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to be great fun is discovering more about the Japanese culture and traditions in a more rural but honest way, rather than the usual image of modern Japan, the matter that is reflected even in using a classical orchestral score.\r\n\r\nAt last, a resonant line saying \"What I believed to be my dream, was propably not my real dream\" makes one think and may it be a turning point in someone's life as it was for Daigo.",

Telling the story of a young cellist, who starts to work as an undertaker after his orchestra gets disbanded, turns out to be one of the more strong and involving drama film in recent times. \n\nHaving watched the film without any preconceptions, Departures turned out to be one of the better drama films in a very long time that gives insight on a universally interesting topic, Death, and how Japanese culture deals with it. Rarely in these days films are involving enough to make a true emotion impact on viewer, so I was positively surprised to see Departures being an exception. On multiple occasion the film sparks powerful feelings - I have to admit shedding a few tears while watching Departures - and at the same time makes the viewer process and think about death from their own subjective point of view. \n\nStory wise the film focuses on Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki), a gifted cellist who never quite made it in the musical scene and how he ends up working as an undertaker. Daigo has to face many hardships due to his new career choice, but ultimately discovers that being an undertaker is what he was meant to do.\n\nOn top of engaging story, Departures is wonderfully acted by all actors involved, with Masahiro Motoki deserving a special remark for his great lead performance. Motoki depicts his character Daigo in very controlled Japanese manner, all the while being very lifelike opposed to the generic iron masked actors found in most Asian films. It must be said that the film is extremely slow paced which might turn away some viewers, but I found the whole subject and Japanese approach towards death absolutely fascinating.",

And despite everybody who presumptively disapproves of his profession, he keeps on doing what he does in helping others in a time of need and even finding a piece of salvation in it all for himself. . . Darkly humorous at times (it opens up with him unknowingly working on a transsexual) and tip-toeing around some very genuine dramatic themes, \"Departures\" really tackles the full spectrum of life and one's own mortality. It has the element of what made me such a fan of the show \"Six Feet Under\" in how it used death and dying to showcase what living is really all about. There are moments where the story-telling comes across as plain easy, but more often than not it gets masked by the overall sincerity of the film as well as its players.

            "content": "There are few films that delve into the Japanese art of beautifying the dead. Nonetheless, Y?jir? Takita's 2008 film \"Departures (Okuribito)\", which took home the best Foreign Language prize at the 2009 Academy Awards, does exactly that.\r\n\r\nThe film is loosely adapted from Aoki' Simmon's 2002 autobiography, \"Coffinman: the Journal of a Buddhist Mortician\". Hero Diago (played by former boyband heartthrob Masahiro Motoki) is a down-on-his- luck Tokyo cellist who loses his job when his orchestra disbands.\r\n\r\nHe returns to his remote home-town with his meek, adoring wife Mika (Riyoki Hurosue) and takes residence in his late mother's house in an effort to reinvent himself. He discovers a newspaper advertisement for what he thinks is a travel agency helping out with \"departures\", only to learn that the position is for a firm that specialises in departures of a very different kind. A departure from which no traveler returns: death. This fosters his initiation into the subtle art of \"encoffinment\". The story that follows is a moving portrait of living with death as our protagonist must overcome his revulsion at his new line of work, while confronting some personal demons.\r\n\r\nThe ensemble is appropriately dramatic. Particularly notable is the leading man as well as his mentor Mr. Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) who hires him and Yuriko Uemura (Kimiko Yo), a fellow employee at the funeral agency.\r\n\r\n\"Departures\" follows in the path of other distinguished Japanese cinema such as Kurosawa's \"Ikiru\" and Juzo's \"The Funeral\". But while \"Ikuru\" and \"The Funeral\", focus more on the repercussions of death, \"Departures\" centres on the ceremony, the rituals of encoffinment and the passing into the afterlife. The film looks at abandonment, both in life and death as a cruel certainty. The film's greatest asset is its shimmering and poignant cinematography. A wind-tossed cherry blossom tree in such a film is inevitable, coming to life in spring to remind the Japanese that life is renewed after winter, only to die quickly after. In appreciating that transience, the Japanese seek to define themselves.\r\n\r\nBy framing the harshness of death with the gentle treatment of the dead at the hands of Diago, the audience sees how the caring preparation of the body allows it to be softly ushered towards the final stop. This juxtaposition simultaneously confronts the taboo role of a figure who continually faces death, but creates an art form; one which is imbued with kindness and beauty.\r\n\r\nAided by the use of classical music that decorates the soundtrack, Takita juxtaposes the sacred and the profane in a soft, pretty film lined with enough perversity to arrest the viewer. The film's alignment of the sublime and ridiculous is sparing, but enriches the tale.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, this film beat out the critically acclaimed, \"Waltz with Bashir\" and \"The Class\", to win the Best Foreign Film prize at the Oscars. Beneath its pretty, emotional fa\u00e7ade lie many layers that touch on the grizzly yet entirely normal nature of mortality. It's all there if you scratch beneath the surface.",

But little does he know that his life is about to take him on a strange yet beautiful journey working as a funeral professional who prepares lifeless bodies for both burial and entrance to the next life.\n\nAs dark as the plot might sound to be, this is actually a very touching film. It makes sure to bring joy into its main theme, \"death.\" To bring great feelings into such a serious subject is hard to do, but this film sure does a great job on it. There are however, some gloomy moments in Departures but only when necessary. It seems as if this film knows a lot about human nature, and nature itself which makes it seem very realistic. From humor, to sadden, to hopes and dreams, to death, and so much more, these feelings are all balanced in such a great order that makes its viewing experience come alive.

In a society where taboos and superstitions rule everyone's lives, the story of this film is actually much more than just a person coming to terms with an unrespectable job but a parable about how the unpleasant shouldn't always be swept under a rug.  The social stigma against being conscious of the dead is explored marvelously without being too didactic because the film understands that, while it's making a statement about a Japanese mindset, it is still a story about a person trying to find more meaning in his life.   Furthermore, despite it's heavy subject, Okuribito is able to have fun with its characters with a lot of sincere comedy moments that really help soften you up for the heavier scenes.  This balance between comedy and drama is marvelously handled by writer Koyama and director Takita as you come to understand that the unpleasantness of death can't be hidden away forever and avoiding it like the plague would be counterproductive.  That said, the film does fall flat on a few occasionally overly sappy and largely unnecessary moments such as the cello sequence.  At times, the film is also too afraid to move on to another scene as it's unsure whether it brought its point across.  This adds to a very slow viewing experience especially at the beginning of the movie and, some segments in the final act.  However, as a movie it's a very sincere and solid exploration of Japan and its relationship with the dead.",

He at first disdains the job but ends up keeping it, which for some reason is resented by the towns' people, and to whom he keeps this a secret from his wife, of which she eventually finds out due to some bizarre, humorous tapes. Daigo also gains a better understanding of life, and remembering back to his happy childhood, wondering what did become of his father after he left his family when he was very young. Both funny and powerful, this slow-paced movie is a memorable character study on an individual, as well as informative film one on a career type that I had never really hurt of. I find it ironic that people declare this career as disgusting, since they are the ones who hired Daigo and his company to perform the act of preparing the deceased individual. Nicely composed story, with very nice photography to spare. Incidentally, actor Motoki has some sort of defining age thing going. The actor is in his mid-40's here, but he really looks like someone who is still in his 20's.",

Departures doesn't try to do anything fancy, it's simply a story of growing up and coming to terms with yourself, and your life.  Our main character (\"Dai-chan\") is at a crossroads in his life, but just as one door closes, another opens, and he finds himself recapturing his roots while settling his demons, working on his marriage, and discovering a new career he couldn't even have imagined.  But while learning to understand the pain of others, he's able to come to terms with his own pain, and is finally able to put his hatred and sorrow away.. for good.  It's difficult to comment on the Japanese acting and emotions, but with my naivety I still thought it was very well done, especially by leading man Masahiro Motoki.  A few times in the film, I felt like \"now would be the perfect time to end it\", yet it continued, and while this almost always means certain death for a movie, 'twas not the case for Departures.  Each added increment added more to the story and more to the closure of the story, and it worked well.  The cinematography, while unglamorous, was beautiful.  There was one scene in the beginning with the red sun rising amidst the backdrop of mountains, and I couldn't help but feel whoever imagined the Japanese flag was probably looking at a scene just like that, the land of the rising sun.  The music only added to the atmosphere of the tale, and in addition to being a major plot element, enhanced the film's depth.  I honestly couldn't find a complaint with this movie; it was unspectacular, but flawless, and exactly what I was looking for.  Good characters, a good plot, and a good evening ;)",

JK) that strikes a chord with your heart and makes you chuckle occasionally. But unlike some have experienced, I didn't come across a sequence worth shredding a tear. The duration could easily have been trimmed without affecting the quality of the movie. Reducing the number of encoffining ceremonies wouldn't have affected the significance of the movie or its title in my opinion. The movie left two important situations unexplained/incomplete, all the more for those who need everything spelled out to them!!! I wish the timing was rather allocated to elaborote those matters rather than showing the numerous encoffining procedures. Most disappointing was the sequence towards the end. Either the makers shouldn't have touched that topic (It could have been omitted. That wouldn't have been great, but I'd prefer omission to going for it given the way they did it.), but since they did, I wish they'd given it a decent shape. Except for those minute complaints, I find the movie fit to watch and enjoy. And if you don't mind exaggeration, it's a marvelous family drama not to be missed. The journey of the self-acclaimed loser deserves a watch.\n\n\nTIP: If you don't feel well and feel like throwing up, postpone viewing it for the time being. See if you can get anything else for time pass. Not that it's any hardcore, but at such times, even the least gross scene tend to be harmful. Good for you if it doesn't apply to you.",

And nearly want to give it up upon family's and friends's request, but later he experiences joy and feel a sense of fulfillment in his work. Every funeral he goes though becomes a lesson to teach him how to be a professional.\r\nThe last funeral of the film, what he did for his father shows that he is a compete professional comparing at the first.\r\nI also like how Daigo figures out what his father looks like during he performs the service. That last 2 funerals are so touching and I nearly crired during watching it.\r\nOther than Daigo, I think the President of NK Agency, Daigo's boss (Tustomu Yamazaki), also did a very good job in the film.
