    "summary": "Born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., Christopher Wallace (Jamal Woolard) parlays his gift for storytelling into a career as a rap artist. Eventually dubbing himself Biggie Smalls, then later, the Notorious B.I.G., Wallace's tales about violent street life take him to the top of the rap charts. The subject he so often raps about catches up with him in March of 1997, when he is shot to death after leaving a party.",

            "content": "Hip hop finally gets a worthy drama with this very good bio-film of Christopher Wallace, aka Notorious B.I.G. Director George Tilman, Jr., who did the wonderful 'Soul Food', handles the life of Biggie Smalls with style, wit, and a light edge. He makes this story entertaining, informative, and moving. The screenwriters stay true to many of the facts concerning Biggie's life and career (all dramatized to poignant effect) and don't shy away from his rough, impulsive, brutish side. There have been many films and TV programs about Wallace before, but the writing gives us a bit of a different Biggie than we've seen before: he's funny, charming, sometimes brash, a bit cocky, and somewhat ominous. Forget the familiar story arc, obvious foreshadowing, and small patches of weak dialogue--the film hinges on the casting, especially that of the title role. Unknown Jamal Woolard (a rapper who goes by the name of Gravy) brings this icon to vivid life. He perfectly nails Biggie's personality, and utterly resembles him, physically and vocally. He carries the film well. Derek Luke is a lot of fun as the charismatic Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs, cutting loose on the man's style and high-charge energy. Anthony Mackie is impressive as Tupac Shakur. Naturi Naughton and Antonique Smith are both great as Lil Kim and Faith Evans, respectively. Angela Bassett, always classy, shines as Biggie's stern yet loving mother. It doesn't reveal too much we don't know about this infamous cultural legend, but as far as hip hop-themed films go, this one ranks as definitive",

In this, the formula clashed somewhat with the true, bending the portrayal of B.I.G. and ignoring some of the more unsavory aspects of his life.\n\nDuration/Tempo: (2.5/5) At 2 hours and 2 minutes, it's a long movie that felt very long.  There was plenty of worthwhile content here, but the film could have benefited by a more aggressive edit.\n\nCast & Crew: (3.5/5) Jamal Woolard, Derek Luke, Naturi Naughton, and Anthony Mackie all did well.\n\nSummary: (3/5) The cast was good, but the story could have been better and the film felt long.

It's one of the best biopics I've seen. It shows us the struggles and successes that the rapper went through during his short life. The film surprisingly takes some good time to develop the early history of the rapper, at the beginning of the movie. Jamal Woolard is very good at portraying Biggie. Angela Bassett as the rapper's mother is also strong. Notorious is an exciting and fascinating movie, full of good music, energy, and also tackles themes of masculinity and the pursuit of dreams. Overall, this movie is very good, and is a must-see for fans of the titular rapper. And others should also see this pic, it's very informative! Recommended!!",

The main problem with the story is its intention to give an overall look, thus sacrificing the moment to moment drama that could have been more resonant. 'Notorious' instead comes of a largely basic portrait filled with the usual narrative elements one would come to expect from a music biopic, and given the subject, that's a shame.

It's careful to being respectful of it's subject, but at the end of the day, it's another rags to riches biopic tinged with tragedy and hardship. Christopher Wallace (Jamal Woodard) grew up in Brooklyn with his mother Voletta (Angela Bassett), at the time during the mid 1980's, there was a \"crack epidemic\" in America, and Christopher ends up being a dealer on the streets, and his mother kicks him out when she discovers what he's doing, Christopher even spends time behind bars for dealing. However, Christopher has a talent for rapping, and he's discovered by Sean Combs (Derek Luke), who has Christopher signed up to Bad Boy Records, and Christopher becomes The Notorious B.I.G. But, dark times lie ahead after he meets West Coast rapper  Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie). It's a very good film, and you don't have to know or even like rap music to get at what Tillman and his team have made here, it captures the era well, and the film was even produced by Wallace's mother, as well as Sean Combs. Plus, Wallace's own son, Christopher Wallace, Jr. plays his own father when he was a boy.",

            "content": "George Tillman Jr.'s \"Notorious,\" a by-the-numbers biopic about the life of Brooklyn rapper Christopher \"Notorious B.I.G.\" Wallace (1972-1997), is sure to only please the members of his core fan-base, myself amongst one of them. In March 1997 Biggie Smalls was shot and killed in Los Angeles, California, just seven months after his friend and fellow rap artist Tupac Shakur (1971-1996) was shot and killed in Las Vegas.Many thought that their murders were part of the whole East Coast/West Coast rivalry between rap artists during the mid '90s. Both Big and Tupac became the unlikely martyrs of gangsta rap and the violence that characterizes it. What's most shameful about that is that over a decade after their deaths, it seems that the hip-hop community has yet to learn a very valuable lesson.But I'm getting off-track. \"Notorious\" is a well-made and well-acted movie. Unfortunately, however, it's too by-the-numbers and follows the tried-and-true methods of most biopic storytelling: it glamorizes the life of the character, goes from one success to another, and doesn't really shed anything new on the person the movie is about. Of course it traces the beginnings of Biggie's life, from growing up as a bright Catholic school student in Brooklyn raised by his loving mother Voletta Wallace (a perfectly cast Angela Bassett), to his dropping out of school at age 17 to sell crack on the streets to help feed his baby daughter, and his eventual being signed to the then-newly formed Bad Boy Records by his best friend Sean \"Puffy\" Combs (Derek Luke). The rest, as they say, is history.I also forgot to mention that Jamal Woolard, as Biggie, who is also an aspiring rapper himself, is probably the best thing about this movie. He really captures the essence, and character of Big, and not only does he look like him, but he also talks AND sounds like him. And his skills on the microphone are undeniable as well. He lends some authenticity to the film's rhyming sessions, rapping to the songs of the real-life Notorious B.I.G., and he pulls it off magnificently. It's a star-making performance that unfortunately gets overshadowed by too many of the film's flaws.The script (co-authored by Biggie's biographer Cheo Hodari Coker) skips from one success to another; that's the biggest problem with most biopics. Another problem I had was that the portrait of the main character was pretty one-sided. While I personally consider his debut record \"Ready to Die\" to be one of the most important and significant rap albums ever recorded - it helped return the East Coast rap scene to prominence - I'm not totally certain that he was truly one of the greatest rap artists who ever lived, especially after only two finished recordings. And I really would have liked to have seen more of Big's friendship with Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie), which I felt was one of the most overlooked and tragic aspects of his life during the East Coast/West Coast rivalries. (People often forget that not only were they friends early on, but they were very close friends.)And while I'm quite certain that the sex appeal of Lil' Kim (Naturi Naughton) is one of the reasons for her success as a rapper, I also feel that one of the reasons she's here, apparently, is to show A LOT of skin and seem like the biggest, baddest 'ho in hip-hop (that's debatable). Big's relationship with wife Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) was not all that well-developed either, as was Big's friendship with Puffy, or the members of Junior M.A.F.I.A., who he helped to promote along with Lil' Kim, whom he was carrying on an affair with while still married to Faith. I also would have liked to have seen some of the paranoia and fear that gripped Biggie in the final months of his life as well, and a little bit more on the aftermath of his murder.Like I said earlier, I'm a fan of the Notorious B.I.G. myself, and so I'm sure that I'm one of those people that would have liked \"Notorious\" a lot more. That's the biggest tragedy about his life and this film. His short life and violent death made him one of the most important, and tragic, figures in hip-hop. I also think it's a disgrace that not much has been done by law enforcement officials to try to solve his murder, or Tupac's for that matter, and the questions revolving around the involvement of corrupt police officers in both killings have yet to be followed up in any significant fashion by anyone.I'm not going to be a clich\u00e9: I don't think he was one of the greatest rappers, personally, but the impact of his music on the industry cannot be denied by anyone: he helped the East Coast's rise back to the top of the rap scene in the mid '90s. As for the movie about his life, on the hand, it could have been better - a lot better.7/10",

Hilariously confused sequences include a young drug-dealing Biggy ruthlessly dealing crack to a pregnant addict - much to the disgust of his unusually responsible corner-boy pal D-Roc, only to find that later she is apparently completely recovered - child in toe - dancing ecstatically down the streets of Brooklyn, seemingly unharmed by Biggies earlier transgression. Que an outrageously smug shot of Biggy looking like a self-righteous pimp, who presumably foresaw this outcome and therefore learned nothing from it. This is one of many examples of the filmmaker's (not coincidently Puff-Daddy-Diddy-Dirty-Money and Biggie's own mother) attempts to glorify his street image while simultaneously assuring us of his innocence and naivety up until his tragic and violent demise as a consequence of the East-West Coast beef that was in reality not entirely discouraged by his party. Woolard does well in the lead roll, while Mackie makes a charismatic Tupac and Antonique Smith a lovely Faith Evans. Derek Luke, however, is infinitely more handsome and less sleazy than Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and one imagines is more like the latter's bloated image of himself than that of actual reality. The tunes are, of course, incredible and the only reason to endure this dire, sycophantical nightmare.",

It's pretty educational regarding his life, I learned a lot of things I didn't know. \r\n\r\nSomething that really bothers me about movies based on real life is when the characters don't look anything like who they're supposed to be. The only person who really looked like who they were supposed to was Notorious, but everyone else was confusing. A lot of the time I was just waiting for someone to call somebody else by their names before I knew what was going on. That was really frustrating for me. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I've heard is that it doesn't capture the amazing personality of Notorious, and I kind of understand. It does capture a little bit of it though, for sure. The film didn't really make me understand how he became so famous and loved so fast. It tried to say it, but it was way too vague and quick about it. There was too much focus on his love life and not enough on his career, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe plot was interesting. It's made even more interesting because it's true. I liked the story-telling techniques by the director, but I feel like he could have done better. There were some things that needed more explaining, and some things that needed less. It's all right.\r\n\r\nThe music is great, but of course, only if you like rap. If not, you probably won't have a good time. I really love Biggie's style and I think he was really skilled, so I really enjoyed watching the parts when he was rapping. It has a great soundtrack. \r\n\r\nMain point, I liked this film. It had beautiful shots and a nice style. It captured the streets of New York and the dangers of the gangster life. I'm not saying it's the best one ever, but it was a little better than decent. I recommend it for a rent or to borrow from a buddy, but I probably won't be buying it soon.

            "content": "George Tillman Jr.'s \"Notorious,\" a by-the-numbers biopic about the life of Brooklyn rapper Christopher \"Notorious B.I.G.\" Wallace (1972-1997), is sure to only please the members of his core fan-base, myself amongst one of them. I was 11 in March 1997 when Biggie Smalls was shot and killed in Los Angeles, California, just seven months after his friend and fellow rap artist Tupac Shakur (1971-1996) was shot and killed in Las Vegas; Tupac died the day after my 11th birthday in 1996.\n\nMany thought that their murders were part of the whole East Coast/West Coast rivalry between rap artists during the mid '90s. Both Big and Tupac became the unlikely martyrs of gangsta rap and the violence that characterizes it. What's most shameful about that is that over a decade after their deaths, it seems that the hip-hop community has yet to learn a very valuable lesson.\n\nBut I'm getting off-track. \"Notorious\" is a well-made and well-acted movie. Unfortunately, however, it's too by-the-numbers and follows the tried-and-true methods of most biopic storytelling: it glamorizes the life of the character, goes from one success to another, and doesn't really shed anything new on the person the movie is about. Of course it traces the beginnings of Biggie's life, from growing up as a bright Catholic school student in Brooklyn raised by his loving mother Voletta Wallace (a perfectly cast Angela Bassett), to his dropping out of school at age 17 to sell crack on the streets to help feed his baby daughter, and his eventual being signed to the then-newly formed Bad Boy Records by his best friend Sean \"Puffy\" Combs (Derek Luke). The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nI also forgot to mention that Jamal Woolard, as Biggie, who is also an aspiring rapper himself, is probably the best thing about this movie. He really captures the essence, and character of Big, and not only does he look like him, but he also talks AND sounds like him. And his skills on the microphone are undeniable as well. He lends some authenticity to the film's rhyming sessions, rapping to the songs of the real-life Notorious B.I.G., and he pulls it off magnificently. It's a star-making performance that unfortunately gets overshadowed by too many of the film's flaws.\n\nThe script (co-authored by Biggie's biographer Cheo Hodari Coker) skips from one success to another; that's the biggest problem with most biopics. Another problem I had was that the portrait of the main character was pretty one-sided. While I personally consider his debut record \"Ready to Die\" to be one of the most important and significant rap albums ever recorded - it helped return the East Coast rap scene to prominence - I'm not totally certain that he was truly one of the greatest rap artists who ever lived, especially after only two finished recordings. And I really would have liked to have seen more of Big's friendship with Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie), which I felt was one of the most overlooked and tragic aspects of his life during the East Coast/West Coast rivalries. (People often forget that not only were they friends early on, but they were very close friends.)\n\nAnd while I'm quite certain that the sex appeal of Lil' Kim (Naturi Naughton) is one of the reasons for her success as a rapper, I also feel that one of the reasons she's here, apparently, is to show A LOT of skin and seem like the biggest, baddest 'ho in hip-hop (that's debatable). Big's relationship with wife Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) was not all that well-developed either, as was Big's friendship with Puffy, or the members of Junior M.A.F.I.A., who he helped to promote along with Lil' Kim, whom he was carrying on an affair with while still married to Faith. I also would have liked to have seen some of the paranoia and fear that gripped Biggie in the final months of life as well, and a little bit more on the aftermath of his murder.\n\nLike I said earlier, I'm a fan of the Notorious B.I.G. myself, and so I'm sure that I'm one of those people that would have liked \"Notorious\" a lot more. That's the biggest tragedy about his life and this film. His short life and violent death made him one of the most important, and tragic, figures in hip-hop. I also think it's a disgrace that not much has been done by law enforcement officials to try to solve his murder, or Tupac's for that matter, and the questions revolving around the involvement of corrupt police officers in both killings have yet to be followed up in any significant fashion by anyone.\n\nI'm not going to be to a clich\u00e9: I don't think he was one of the greatest rappers, personally, but the impact of his music on the industry cannot be denied: he helped the East Coast's rise back to the top of the rap scene in the mid '90s. As for the movie about his life, on the hand, it could have been better - a lot better.",

The image we know about. The film \"Notorious\" is more interested in the kid. He was born in Brooklyn, loved his mother (a teacher who was studying for a master's degree), got into street-corner drug dealing because he liked the money, performed rap on the street and at 20 was signed by record producer Sean Combs. Four years later, he \r\nwas dead. Documentaries about B.I.G. have focused on the final years of his life. \"Notorious\" tells us of a bright kid who was abandoned by his father, raised by a mother from Jamaica who laid down the rules and told the kids on the playground he would be famous some day. \"You too fat, too black and too ugly,\" a girl tells him. He just looks at her. He is sweet-tempered, even after being seduced into the street-corner crack business, but he sounds tough in his rap songs -- tough, introspective, autobiographical and a gifted writer.\r\n          In \"Notorious,\" they show how talent can lift a kid up off the street corner, but can't protect him in a culture of violence. The whole gangsta rap posture was dangerous, as B.I.G. and Tupac proved.",

The material is honest and heartfelt\u0097for the lead actor, this assessment goes tenfold. Best of all, like the best of the genre, the film is more interested in its subject\u0092s eventful life than controversial death. Perhaps, the film could have been even more warts-and-all and less like a filmstrip, but the story that results is never boring. Buoyed by an amazingly dead-on performance, Notorious is everything an invigorating biography should be.\r\n\r\nIn this R-rated bio-pic, the life and violent death of East Coast rapper Christopher Wallace, AKA Notorious B.I.G. (Woolard), is chronicled. \r\n\r\nThe film takes a definite vantage point, albeit in successive cradle-to-grave chapters. And this is not to say that the film should have embraced a manic, non-linear, cross cutting approach a la Nixon\u0097Notorious\u0092s style is in its straightforwardness. Oftentimes, the flick feels like a music video, which would normally be met with cries of \u0091foul\u0092 by your reviewer. Given the fact that the breadth of the story takes place during the MTV Age, however, this manner serves the material perfectly. Though the material drives alongside his drug-selling, two-timing, and warring with fellow rapper Tupac Shakur, the script never crashes head-on into the overall issue of angel or devil. Instead, it arguably takes a definite biased stand, elevating its subject to pariah. There is no debating the star-making turn by Woolard, however. His brilliant performance rings of realism.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Noteworthy but not hypnotic.",

His life is tragically cut short and the movie ends on a high note of how he influenced a lot of people.\n\nThe only gripe I have with the film is that it is a little biased. This is very apparent with the whole 2Pac incident with making everyone look super innocent and all the West Coast rappers looking super bad.
