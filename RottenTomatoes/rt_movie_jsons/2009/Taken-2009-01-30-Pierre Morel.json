            "content": "January is usually something of a dead zone in terms of the movie-going season. But Luc Besson, that French veteran of action movies, delivers a shot of adrenaline to audiences craving a 'Bourne'-style actioner with this brutal, sadistic, cruel, and crackling thriller. Serving as writer and producer, Besson's stamp is all over this. He gives the once-and-always Oskar Shindler (Liam Neeson) the chance to be a bonafide action star. Neeson, a fine actor, more than proves he could have been a vivid action star, had he not chosen the high road. It's got some annoying clichÃ©s and a little bit of corny dialogue, but director Pierre Morel delivers the goods. It's an action film of stark simplicity--ex-secret agent's daughter is kidnapped by bad guys, and he will stop at nothing to get her back. Nothing deep, ground-breaking, or entirely unpredictable. This is a lean and efficient action machine. The chases are fast, the combat is bone-crunching, many a bullet hits its mark with deft brutality. Every pulse-pounding moment is edited into a visceral and satisfying blur. The film's genius set-piece is the main kidnapping scene. Brilliantly written and crisply filmed, it's a harrowing jolt that effectively shifts the film into high gear. This is also clearly a PG-13 actioner in the age of 'The Dark Knight'. Seriously, this thing is one or two drops of blood away from an R rating. I'm not complaining, it's just more of an observation. This popcorn thriller is a shot of caffeine for action junkies, an actioner with no milk, no foam, and--in this lackluster movie season--no Equal",

You already know before the scene even begins he's gonna fight his way through everyone effortlessly, with plot armor and Light Yagamiesque prediction skills. He only really has trouble when he gets knocked out and then fights the movie's final boss on the yacht at the end. The ending was absolute trash, with the daughter acting just as dumb as in the beginning and everyone giggling and smiling when they should be absolutely traumatized.

What I did not expect, when I paused to visit the toilet about an hour in, was to be completely gripped by what was going on on the screen. Taken found itself a cult following after its release, seemingly by thousands of people who seemed unaware of the existence of previous B-movies in general. But there's no denying Taken's cultural and cinematic legacy almost thirteen years on. As well as being an expertly put together exploitation movie, casting Liam Neeson was a masterstroke, one that has essentially launched an entire sub-genre of its own. Neeson has arguably played the same character in films like Unknown (2011), The Grey (2011) and Non-Stop (2014) to name but a few, as well as actually revisiting the character of Brian Mills in Taken 2 (2012) and Tak3n (2014). And the crux of the issue with regards to Taken, is that, well, it's a pretty good thriller on its own. It's not groundbreaking, but it's exciting, thrilling, funny, and more important than it had any right to be. The question is if Taken hadn't performed financially as well as it did, would we still be talking about Liam Neeson portraying the same tired, ex-insert agency as applicable character in various films? Perhaps not, and there is a dispute that Neeson's acting chops would have been better tested in different roles across the filmic spectrum if Taken hadn't kicked off the Neeson B-movement if you will. But there's no point in harbouring resentment at this; if you want to see Neeson at his absolute finest, go and re-watch Schindler's List (1993). If you're in the mood for a solid thriller, or better still, a top of the range violent exploitation movie, you could do a hell of a lot worse than Taken. Hell, you couldn't do much better in my opinion.",

Eh, maybe not Indiana Jones or anything, but certainly better than Crystal Skull.  Taken is almost a cliche now for a frenetic 'save the girl at all costs' action flick, and there are probably dozens of copycat films based on this, including 2 sequels.\nBasically, Liam's daughter is captured by human traffickers, and Liam used to kill people for some shady organization, so he is gonna slit some throats!  The action is fast, grim and tightly woven in to the storyline - I never felt there was a wasted car chase or anything.  Despite guns being literally lying around in this film, Liam prefers to kill people with his hands mostly.  A bit morally ambiguous sometimes, the main character keeps you rooting for him with his relentless pursuit of his daughter.

As the plot sounds and that is Liam Neeson, it is not surprising that it has caught people's attention.\n\nThe visual direction is very good because the movie ends up being very entertaining, this is thanks to the well executed sequences of action, the performances are also very acceptable, but of course those of Neeson and Janssen, are the most outstanding. Another positive aspect of the film is that it can be said that he takes his time in the sense that there is no meaningless action in the first 5 minutes, although the film is not much he dedicates a little time to his characters, and That is very good, you know who is who and why things, you find out why their situation is like this, among other things, I liked it so much that it does not rush things so much, let's be honest that is worth recognizing from a movie of action.\n\nI think it is interesting the way in which the film briefly shows how white trafficking is, I am not saying that its representation is 100% realistic, but I dare to say that if it is a bit similar to reality, the film It teaches you that the majority of customers of that kind of thing are not lazy in the street, if they are not rich and often famous people. (Maybe that is one of the reasons why the film did not got good well reviews)\nPreviously I said that the action scenes are well executed, but I did not say that they were very well executed, I mean that it can be said that to some extent the fight sequences are somewhat simple, an example of a very well executed sequence of action would be in \"John Wick\" the way Keanu Reeves moves is incredible, you know he gave himself to the role, because I train Kung Fu literally, and thanks to that you believe it when he defeats everyone, while with Liam you see him \"Fight\" and you say \"well it's just a movie\". Speaking of the bad for more positive aspects that it has is not saved from the negative aspects, although the film is well narrated, many things are very convenient, for example, that of the subject that says \"Good luck\", that coincidentally he runs into it again by chance and casually says \"Good Luck\" and despite the fact that people's voices change a little when they speak on the phone or microphone, Liam's character \"Brian\" manages to recognize him because surely the scriptwriters they thought most would say \"ThatÂ´s awesome\".\nInstead of surprising you, the scene only ends up being convenient for the plot to progress, but since after that they reward you with an entertaining action scene.\n\nBut well the rest is more convenience and Liam proving unrealistically that nobody could against him. In spite of all the good, it weighs on the bad.\n\nIn conclusion \"Taken\" is a very entertaining action movie, which explores in an acceptable way the subject of trafficking in white, with good sequences of action, an acceptable direction, acceptable performances, a good narration, with various plot conveniences, and things unrealistic, but in spite of that I dare to say that it is a classic for modern action cinema, that is why \"Taken\" manages to get a good 7/10.",

Taken takes killer choreography with brutal hand to hand combat and pits it against hard-nosed detective mystery noir. Morel's direction is solid with some dated editing choices, but Taken is fast paced and easy to follow.\n\nThe action fights are as cool as Liam Neeson threatening people across Paris. It's a simple movie with a basic and cliche premise, but it works. Once Neeson's Bryan has a goal of finding his daughter Kim, we get to witness his specialized skills in action, tracking down girl traffickers and locating his missing daughter. The constant killing is always entertaining to watch Neeson execute with extreme prejudice.\n\nNeeson makes for a believable action star with his serious persona, deep gravelly voice, and notable presence. His massive stature brings an intensity to his close quarters combat sequences, while his charming personality make his dialogue endlessly quotable. \n\nFamke Janssen is great as the ignorant rich mother that is out of touch with reality. Though Besson cannot write women to save his life, Janssen keeps her character Lenore strictly in a mean ex-wife mode at all times digging insults into Neeson. Maggie Grace is good as Neeson's scared, kidnapped daughter Kim. A young Katie Cassidy makes an appearance as the dumb friend Amanda.\n\nLastly, Leland Orser makes for a neat supporting actor as Bryan's friend and former coworker for the government named Sam.\n\nTaken is fascinating and dark, but with Luc Besson's script, all is well. Besson's jokes are hilarious one liners delivered with Neeson's suave nonchalance. Besson's story is straightforward and gritty with biting commentary on police corruption and the danger of travelling abroad.\n\nWhile, some of the music, editing, and cinematography feels dated. The overall experience of Taken is a thrilling one.",

            "content": "I do not understand what's so good about Taken. Yes, some of the action scenes were fun and Liam Neeson is a badass, but it doesn't really have much of a plot, or even characters for that matter. The only characters in the movie are Bryan Mills, his daughter, and several characters to move the plot forward. Not even a villain, just a bunch of random Albanian expendables. His daughter is supposed to be 17, but the actress looks like she's in her early-mid twenties. Minor complaint! Major complaint, it's derivative and even a little bit silly.\n\nBryan Mills has a CIA contact when it's convenient for the script, like a character to tell Bryan who kidnapped his daughter, and another character in France (Jean-Claude) to tell him about a local prostitution ring. He even gives him a card which he uses later on to impersonate as Jean-Claude and the movie even sets up Jean-Claude as an antagonist. He also has 96 hours to save his daughter, but that deadline becomes irrelevant after 56 hours. Why bother with a 96 hour deadline in the first place? And why 96 hours?\n\nI don't expect every action movie to have a plot, but if it's not going to have a plot, it has to at least have kickass action scenes with impressive stunts and choreography, the kind that you see in many martial art films. Taken doesn't really have that. The editing clearly tried to work around Neeson's limitations as an action star. The only action scene I really enjoyed was the very last fight scene.\n\nTaken achieves what it sets out to do for sure. It's a straightforward, undemanding action movie and it doesn't try to be anything more. But even as a straightforward action movie, it's still pretty unremarkable. Is there a reason to watch Taken again over many better action movies? Because I can't really find that many.",

Yes, some of the action scenes were fun and Liam Neeson is a badass, but it doesn't really have much of a plot, or even characters for that matter. The only characters in the movie are Bryan Mills, his daughter, and several characters to move the plot forward. Not even a villain, just a bunch of random Albanian expendables. His daughter is supposed to be 17, but the actress looks like she's in her early-mid twenties. Minor complaint! Major complaint, it's derivative and even a little bit silly.\n\nBryan Mills has a CIA contact when it's convenient for the script, like a character to tell Bryan who kidnapped his daughter, and another character in France (Jean-Claude) to tell him about a local prostitution ring. He even gives him a card which he uses later on to impersonate as Jean-Claude and even sets up Jean-Claude as an antagonist. He also has 96 hours to save his daughter, but that deadline becomes irrelevant after 56 hours. Why bother with a 96 hour deadline in the first place? And why 96 hours?\n\nI don't expect every action movie to have a plot, but if it's not going to have a plot, it has to at least have kickass action scenes with impressive stunts and choreography, the kind that you see in many martial art films. Taken doesn't really have that. The editing clearly tried to work around Neeson's limitations as an action star. The only action scene I really enjoyed was the very last fight scene.\n\nTaken achieves what it sets out to do for sure. It's a straightforward, undemanding action movie and it doesn't try to be anything more. But even as a straightforward action movie, it's still pretty unremarkable. Is there a reason to watch Taken again over many better action movies? Because I can't really find that many.",

            "content": "IÂ’ve actually seen Taken 2, but I never watched the original film that kicked off this entire trend of movies about Â“oldÂ” men coming out of retirement to kill a bunch of people again. I can see why this movie was such a hit, because it seems to have all the required elements of a crowd-pleasing action film. The setup makes you sympathize with the protagonist, and then have zero sympathy for the antagonists. It is loaded with intense and visceral scenes of violence that we can justify, because we are programmed to think itÂ’s acceptable for a man to stop at nothing in order to save his daughter. IÂ’ll admit that the way the story is framed also got its hooks into me so that I cared about the good guys and wanted to see them take down the bad guys in any way possible.\n\nLiam Neeson is superb at the most important part of this role...sounding dangerous. The famous phone call that kicks off the action of the film is so well done, and it relies completely on Neeson delivering the lines in just the right way. A lot of the action sequences are shot in creative ways so that he can pull it off or they can hide the fact that weÂ’re actually seeing a stunt double, so I didnÂ’t have any issues with that stuff. The only time I cringed a little about NeesonÂ’s acting was in the opening few scenes before and during his daughterÂ’s party, but I think that was more a symptom of some bad script work. The rest of the cast was fine, but sadly, there wasnÂ’t one villain established well enough to stand out from the rest or to feel like the main antagonist that needed to be defeated.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was the level of violence in Taken. Based on the way people have sold this movie to me in the past, I expected it to be almost traumatic levels of gore and violence. Yet I didnÂ’t get that, instead this movie seemed almost restrained compared to what IÂ’ve seen in other films. ItÂ’s not really a bad thing, but I think I expected a little more shock and awe when he was dispatching a room full of bad guys. Taken is loaded with these scenes where the tension builds up for a few seconds and then it is released very quickly in dramatic fashion. I think it might have worked better if the tension built up a little longer, or if I felt for even one second that he had met his match or might fail. They even had a ticking clock but rarely referenced it.\n\nTaken is kind of dumb in some parts. There are definite logic problems I had with the film, but they are standard across most action movies, so I am accustomed to letting that kind of stuff go. I also liked that they didnÂ’t hide anything or attempt to surprise the audience with the plot of the film. They have scenes very early where the main character and his friends talk about what they used to do, so it never feels like the writers are wasting our time trying to trick us into believing he is just an average guy. And this makes it so we donÂ’t have to be introduced to each new character he meets because we can just accept that these are connections he made in his old life. IÂ’m willing to take some of the common action movie nonsense in Taken, because it is just a fun ride, and I would gladly watch it again any time.",

Never has a word been so fitting, and yet so unfitting at the same time. Taken has an undeniably ability to entertain. Liam Neeson plays a ex-government agent, now hyped bodyguard, who's daughter is kidnapped. He then proceeds to break many people, on his way to try and get his daughter back. I'm trying hard to hold back the laughter when talking about this. Let me break this down. For a film that is supposed to be an action-thriller, it is cluttered with quite decent humour. If they embraced how daft parts of this film are, I may have liked it more. You want a cerebral film? Don't watch this. You want a film with great dialogue? Don't watch this. You want a cliched action film? Well, here it is.\n\nThe only performance that I think I can muster a mention for here is that of Liam Neeson. I don't think I have ever seen such comedic prowess in any being. He puts on showcase his best Bale-era Batman vocal impression. I mean he has a lot to thank for the writing, but his delivery of these lines is exceptional. Delivery in that cliched, deadpan, yet over-the-top manner equals absolutely hilarity, and is very well-placed in a film about his daughter being kidnapped from across the planet. Oh wait... This film isn't a comedy? That's a shame. Every other cliched character is played as just that in this film. Everyone is so serious in this film, and it really is hard to not bust a gut whilst watching. Every performance is so right yet so wrong, in a film that is so right, yet so wrong. These performances are not good, but they are fitting.\n\nI didn't expect such a film. It is great in its total blindness to how humorous it is. Roughly ninety minutes long, it never gets boring. It is a crime that such a script was ever written, but with such script I think they did the best they could have done. You are so taken out of this film by almost every element of it, that it somehow has you fully intrigued. It really is one of those \"it's that bad, that it is good moments\". There are absolutely no surprises in this film. You could map this film out with just the short premise. I cannot bring myself to think awful things of this film, because it did entertain me so very much.\n \nTo finalize, go into this one without expectations. Never has an action-thriller been so non-thrilling, and so funny. I, personally give this film plaudits for being something that I never thought it could be. If you somehow make the mistake of thinking that this film will be a smart, enthralling action-thriller. Run. Run as fast as you can away from this film. However, if you're expectation is to have a laugh, then this film will deliver on that front. If you are a little more impressed by mindless action, give it a watch too. It isn't actually that bad. Honestly. I think.",

In 'Taken' he plays a retired CIA agent who travels to Europe and relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter, who has been kidnapped while on a trip to Paris. If you've read that plot, you know what happens. I don't have to spoil the ending. It's predictable stuff.\n\nIs this movie bad, then? There's certainly some bad stuff here. Luc Besson, who rose to fame with La Femme Nikita, Taxi and The Fifth Element in the 90's, is responsible for the writing here. And I don't know if it's his script or the acting by Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen, but these female supporting characters annoyed the hell out of me. They were bland, predictable, unlikeable and badly acted. I like cookies, but cookie-cutter emotions do not go over well with me.\n\nNeeson is better, but only marginally. He's my new favourite James Bond. If you've ever wanted too see Oskar Schindler or Qui-Gon Jinn punch the throats of countless Albanian criminals, then go see this movie. He performs his rampage well, but it's all --again-- too predictable and too convenient. You can see stuff coming from miles away. \n\nAgain: is this movie bad, then? No. For some reason it stays entertaining for most of the 93 minutes, even though you know how it's going to end and it looks more like a tv commercial than an action movie. With a return of $226M on a $25M budget, you could say that the movie did well. That's why there's a 'Taken 2' and a 'Taken 3'. The second one I've seen, it's more of the same. The third I have yet to see.",

This may be typical save the kidnapped girl story, but the way it gives edge-of-seat thrills combined with well-oiled action its becomes highly engaging. The sharp dialogues with Neeson's deep voice add to the package. Who wouldn't like Neeson's \"I will find you and I will kill you\" dialogue? And the action sequence when he finally finds the bad guys is simply mind blowing. Another of my favorite scenes is when he makes his old friend realize that he has been sitting on desk so long that he has forgotten the difference between a loaded and an empty gun. The plot remains intensely focused on the father's pursuit to find his daughter without floating into unnecessary sub-plots. The only relevant and important characters where the father and daughter, and their relation is well established in first 20 minutes giving room for the audience to invest their emotions. The film also portrays the horrors of human-trafficking giving enough reason for rooting Neeson's character to find and kill all those bad guys. With well choreographed action, engaging soundtrack and slick camera work with power-packed Neeson Taken is a ride not to be missed. I have watched it 5 times now and it was exciting each time. I still remember the first time I saw it about 4 years ago and how it totally blew my mind!\n\nRATING: [4/5]",

It would be a backhanded compliment due to the fact that such a term would imply it isn't good in a traditional sense, when in fact, it is. But maybe calling it a guilty pleasure is purely because of how much fun it is. Although the main plot isn't \"fun\"-about a man's teenage daughter being kidnapped (or... Taken) in Europe and his attempt to rescue her-the viewing experience is and for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons is Pierre Morel's pulpy (and hard broiled) direction, the other is Liam Neeson's performance as an action hero (never gets old) but the clincher is Robert Mark Kamen and Luc Besson's great, genre-centric script. Yes, the same Besson who has proven himself the master of the stylish genre picture (La Femme Nikita, LÃ©on: The Professional, The Fifth Element) and the pairing have gone back to a dormant genre-the vigilante, one-person killing machine, save-your-family-at-all-costs action genre of the 70s and 80s-and it has sorely been missed. Not since the days of the single-minded madness of Charles Bronson in 1974s Death Wish (and it's sequels), Arnold handling a bazooka in 1985s Commando or Bruce Willis being in the wrong place at the wrong time in 1988s Die Hard (and it's sequels) has a character been this aggressive, clinical and wrathful in their pursuit of a goal-and it is a joy to watch. Added with a surprisingly intricate script and a solid performance from Neeson to give life to the character, Taken is a worthy successor of said genre. Although some of the acting in the film is sometimes subpar (seeing Maggie Grace-playing the 17-year-old kidnapped daughter-convey youth through running like a 5-year-old adds to the fun) never diminishes the product and adds to the escapism the film succeeds at creating. Perhaps the guilt with viewing Taken would to not enjoy it.",

He's much better than the movie needs him to be and he's likely the main reason why Taken did well enough to spawn both sequels and imitators.

Taken has got to be one of the worst action films I have ever seen, mainly because it's a very mindless exercise that that's more unpleasant than watchable. The story is very vapid and insipient in dangerous doses, and it also suffers from very bad pacing for a film that runs for 90 minutes. It opens by introducing us to shallow lives that I don't think you can get attached to, which is a very big problem if the writers expect you to feel sympathy for the film's victim or its main character. Speaking of which, the characters are not only sloppily written, but badly acted. I'm already very sure that I can't get attached to them, but many of the characters are simply unbearable, and even Liam Neeson's character sounds generally unpleasant. A big problem is that, after 20 minutes, the film spends pretty much all of its runtime being negative, and this affects the way it presents itself. It all looks unbearably gritty and lifeless, and that gave off a dull atmosphere that made the film boring to watch. Insipient, mindless, boring and unpleasant, this is a highly overrated film that doesn't deserve the success it got, and it fails as entertainment in every possible way.",

All I hear from the Taken reviews are that it is a blast to watch but it lacks sense in its story. What does that matter in this sort of film? If anything, it's more realistic than what most people want to admit. There are parents who are very over protective and serious, that are divorced and there are kidnappings. Why can't they all be connected in a story? It's like Hitchcock says, it's the style in which it's told, which is very, very entertaining. This is a realistic story told in the exact way it was meant to. No one downgrades inception because the concept of dreams within a dream makes no sense, it is in fact rewarded for its creativity. So why is Taken downgraded on its context ? I think critics ought to critique how they criticize movies, because sometimes it just doesn't make sense.",

You know, first shot the punch, cut right before the face, second shot the impact. Taken doesn't abuse that cheap trick and the punches feel real. Secondly the sound is perfect.

Bryan's famous \"I will find you, and I will kill you\" line is memorable and awesome and really gets you ready for the danger to come. While the beginning of the movie was great, the middle had a bit of trouble. At times there were missing character explanations and also names were a big problem. At times I couldn't figure out who the person was until someone said their name. While the action was fun to watch there were times where I felt like it was really unnecessary. I really didn't see the point of killing some people in this movie. A small issue I have with Taken is that I would've liked one main villain. It was cool to see how it was this whole evil organization but I feel like this would be a more memorable movie if we had A villain. The daughter was a really bad character at times. She always gets what she wants and doesn't learn anything from what she experienced. She was either way too happy or crying, and that bothered me a bit. Taken was a pretty good action movie that did well in terms of acting and action but had a few problems with character background. B",

It's an exciting thriller, with a fast pace, simply plot, and plenty of beating people up.  It has some good actors, but they don't perform as well as they do in other films, and the sqript isn't very good.  However the famous line Liam Neeson says to his daughters captors over the phone is very memorable and badass.   The rest of the movie too is what Liam is known for: being a badass who will beat the crap out of anyone that gets in his way and doing so with style and throwing out lines that we now quote.  Overall however exciting of a movie it may be, it's not that great.  It lacks depth, characters, character depth for everyone other than Bryan, and a good sqript.  But it's entertaining, exciting, keeps us awake with its action, never lets up on pace, and has us wanting to see the sequels because of it.  Other than that there isn't much to say about this one, no matter how famous it somehow manages to be. However it could have been better, and the second film is more or less a repeat, and gets a lower rating from me than this one did.  We do have hope however with the awesome looking Taken 3, which I have high expectations for.",

I will NEVER get tired of watching Liam Neeson play Brian Mills, a badass dad who is on a unstoppable mission to find his daughter Kim, who gets kidnapped by a scummy Albanian gang specializing in women trafficking while traveling to Paris.\n\nThe beginning basically paints the picture of how this badass dad (get used to the use of that description a lot) cares for his daughter Kim, who currently lives with her mother, Brian's ex, and her new husband. Brian has recently moved closer to Kim and also gone into retirement from a job which the audience only knows involves government work with some sort of military background. Brian is trying to reconnect his relationship with Kim. His old buddies encourage him to come out for a night to help with security for a pop singer, further emphasizing that this dad isn't just ANY dad. He's a badass dad. Lol!\n\nAfter this one night job, he is approached by Kim and his ex. Kim tells her dad that her friend Amanda invited her to Paris for the summer. She needs him to sign a paper allowing she go. Brian is not keen on the situation, and is concerned for Kim's safety.\nAfter a big scene, he decides to let Kim go under certain conditions, she is to call when she lands and every night and let him know if she goes anywhere else.\n\nBut when Kim and Amanda arrive in Paris they are approached by a boy who convinces them to share a taxi to their place and invites them to a party before leaving. She forgets to call Brian. While settling into the place, Kim uses the bathroom and realizes her dad has been trying to call.\n\nShe calls back and confesses that Amanda's family isn't at the place in Paris. Then Kim witnesses Amanda being kidnapped/taken through the window she's peering out. Brian is visibly frustrated (as if he foresaw this coming like a badass) and converses with Kim. He explains to her that she will be taken. He busts out his super badass dad spy equipment to record the conversation and captures everything. He then tells a man that picks up the phone that he can give Kim back and Brian won't come after him, but if he doesn't, he has \"a very particular set of skills\" that he will use to hunt him down, find him, and kill him. The man dares him.\n\nBrian tells his ex wife Kim was taken. Together they listen as an old buddy of Brian's analyze the recording of the kidnapping and identify the men as Albanian, part of a group specializing in women trafficking. Lately they have been kidnapping young girls traveling. There is only a 96 hour time frame before never finding the girl who has gone missing.\n\nThe rest of the movie highlights the journey of ex government badass dad (Brian) traveling to Europe to find Kim. He will stop at no costs and stampedes through Paris, tracking down the group and causing chaos in order to find Kim.\n\nWill he find her, well that would be a huge spoiler, but you definitely will not be bored finding out. Great action movie, great acting from Liam, so sit down and enjoy this dad's \"particular set of skills\"!",

This is a movie whose plot relies on it being peppered with varying degrees of xenophobia. Every character is a mere cipher that exists only to be punched, stabbed, tortured or shot by Neeson as he combs Paris in order to find his spoiled, brattish daughter who has been kidnapped and sold into prostitution while en-route to a U2 concert. Yep, because every rebellious teenage girl really wants to travel to Europe to see Bono... The lack of substance to the plot is a major shortcoming in this movie as once you grasp the rather basic idea, all there is is a series of second rate punch-ups and nothing approaching tension.

She asks him to pay for her expensive trip to Europe with a friend. The dad was reasonably hesitant about this last minute request and politely tells her that he can't. Guess what happens next? Yeah she cries. Alot. Then she sprints out of the stupid restaurant for the gold. I do not like spoiled children.

The acting is good and the action is very good. This is the kind of action I wanna see more from filmmakers, like interrogations, hand to hand combat, shootouts, car chases, etc. That's the kind of action I like and I'm very positive that I'm not the only one who feels that way. Surprisingly there isn't much fakish material in this movie which kind of surprises me just because usually most action films have that fakish look to them, either way this is a really good action film, I could watch it over and over.

When his daughter is kidnapped while on vacation in Paris, Bryan springs into action. He follows the trail to a string of bad guys who specialize in kidnapping young women and either prostituting them or selling them. This is a cold-blooded vigilante film in which Neeson leaves a slew of corpses behind him. His is a sort of James Bond-ish character, but without the flirting and gadgets. He also lacks the all-important \"licence to kill\". Mills is a private citizen using government skills to kill and maim whoever gets in his way. I can't understand why he doesn't end up in French prison. The film also implies that American operatives have some really nasty training that goes against their image as the world's upright policemen. Still, as revenge wish-fulfillment fantasy, it's well-made and moves along briskly.",

He still operates with cool calculating precision, making him the perfect hero figure for the situation. This is cut from the same quilt as Die Hard and Air Force One. Yes, it is that good! The sex trafficking peril that this kidnapped girl faces is a much more serious villain than most movies employ. This type of awful abduction seems like something that could actually happen, and that makes things feel even more frighteningly real. Audiences will invest far more in this helpless girl due to her horrific situation, then a typical family hostage situation, missing girl, or damsel in distress. This is a huge step up from the director Pierre Morel, who until know is mainly known for the goofy Transporter series. The premise is simple, but the unrelenting action and fast moving camera motion is exceptional. Some critics diminish it for being a somewhat unrealistic, but it never loses touch with of its established level reality or seems corny for a minute. No doubt, about it, this is a great action movie, and it gets everything right.",

            "content": "Taken is a very rare breed of film: It has a splat on the tomatometer, yet it is now widely regarded as a perennial action classic. People have been saying that this film is the finest example of a revenge thriller, that jumpstarted Liam Neeson's career as an action star. In light of the upcoming thriller Non-Stop, I thought I would check this film out so I could get a feel of a Liam Neeson thriller. And I have to say, this film was a pretty big disappointment.\r\n\r\nI suppose a big reason for this is because I had EXTREMELY high expectations for this film. Everyone has told me that this is a modern masterpiece that deserves to have the same level of recognition as Die Hard. So, naturally, I went in expecting it to be an extremely above average action thriller. I'm sorry, but it wasn't.\r\n\r\nI should get into my issues with the film. First off, the characters are extremely poorly written. With the exception of the Liam Neeson character, who is a freaking badass, everyone else in the movie really sucks ass. First off, the daughter. This girl REALLY got on my nerves. She was just such an unbelievably overblown stereotype of a 17 year-old girl. Her character was just completely uninteresting and unengaging, and she served as nothing but a damsel-in-distress. Second, the mother. She was just a complete ex-wife stereotype, and all she did the whole time was generically bicker with Liam Neeson about their failed marriage. Also, her reaction to hearing the news about Kim was absolutely laughable. Then, we have to get to the villain. Oh wait. THERE ISN'T ONE. The bad guys in this movie are just several different members of this trafficking organization, and there isn't one central bad guy in the whole thing. Movies like Die Hard, Patriot Games, and Air Force One have proven that a key to making a film's tension so excellent is to have a great hero/villain pairing. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. Harrison Ford and Sean Bean. Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman. But this movie does not have a central \"boss\" or anything, it's just a whole group of forgettable, uninteresting bad guys. Why not throw in a big, terrifying bad guy for him to fight at the end, played by Mads Mikkelsen or someone like that? That would have been awesome! But sadly, they did not go that route. How sad. The only prominent bad guy that I could point out was that American guy who hung Liam Neeson by his wrists at that fancy restaurant. That guy...... he was the most laughably bad villain in the history of forever. His lines were unbelievably stilted, and his delivery was painful. He was just whiney and stupid, and he dies in the next scene. Ugh.\r\n\r\nNow, one thing I am very hit-and-miss on is the plot. Well, the thing I really, really loved about it was the element involving human trafficking. I really liked this element of the story, because it was a lot darker than most action movies are willing to go with villain schemes, and it was actually fairly realistic. However, it often became hard to follow. Liam Neeson travels from place to place, location to location, building to building, in a very unclear timeframe, and I was heavily confused by some scenes. Also, the ending is an extreme cop-out. SPOILERS AHEAD. Action films are supposed to end with a big action climax, but this film's ending was extremely simplistic and boring. Liam Neeson just jumps on a cruise ship, kicks a few guys, saves his daughter, and the movie's over. When the end credits started rolling, I was literally screaming at the TV. It was such an underwhelming and sudden climax, it just felt like it should have gone on longer. It was really quite annoying. Also, speaking of action, DAT MOTHERFUCKING SHAKY CAM. I have so had enough with directors these days just abusing the shit out of shaky cam. It just doesn't work. There are too many jump cuts and zoom-ins, to the point where it was kind of hard to see what was happening. The action is still fairly god overall, and definitely kept me entertained, I just wish they had slowed down the camera.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I have with this film is the overall writing. This film... it's just not written very well. The dialogue, for the most part, is pretty poor. The scenes that particularly got on my nerves was when Liam Neeson was talking to his wife. All these scenes consist of are unbelievably clichÃ©d and overused ramblings about their failed marriage. The mother incessantly complains about how he was never their for them, he said it concerned his job, it goes back and forth, it's just annoying. And most of the interactions with other characters are just bland and not particularly interesting. EXCEPT for the famous phone call scene. THAT scene was freaking awesome. But the rest of the dialogue just didn't do it for me.\r\n\r\nNow, you're probably wondering why this doesn't have a rotten score, since I disliked so many things about it. Well, I would be lying if I said that this film didn't have me enthralled at times. There were several scenes of nail-biting tension and atmosphere that were just excellent, particularly the kidnapping scene, which had me completely on the edge of my seat. And, of course, Liam Neeson's performance is simply fantastic in every manner. People say this is what jumpstarted his career as an action star, and I can completely see why. His line delivery and physical stunts and demeanor were just excellent on all fronts, and he gives the film a much-needed dark edge. Although, I DO have an issue with the scene where he shoots Jean-Claude's wife to get him to cooperate. I don't know, something about that scene was just a little but too cruel for me. But whatever. In regards to the rest of the acting, most of the cast did pretty well, even if their characters were shit. And I'll admit, I was very intrigued whenever clues were being solved, or Liam Neeson was looking around suspiciously, or when some quiet and tense moments came on. The film had me entertained, and I had some pretty good fun watching it.\r\n\r\nOverall, I must settle with a score of 6/10. I really wanted to enjoy this a lot more. It just struck me as somewhat bland and very forgettable. Perhaps I shouldn't have gone into it with such high expectations, but I had just heard such good things, and I couldn't help but hope for the very best, and I didn't get it. But it certainly is not the worst. The acting is fine, the action is decent, Liam Neeson is a boss, and the pacing is brisk. It's most definitely worth a rental if you've got an hour and a half to kill, just don't think it's the heart-stopper that people have been making it out to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT.......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!!!!!",

It might be the great performance of Liam Neeson that makes it such a great film, or it might be the fantastic action sequences.  I say it's both.\n\nLiam Neeson is such a badass in this film.  For an actor whose background doesn't include many action films, Neeson plays the action hero like a pro.  Sure, sometimes the film pushes the boundaries of believability with some of Neeson's sleuth skills, but it is so cool, I'm willing to overlook it.  Then there's the action, which is all excellent, clever, and heart-pounding.  Whoever choreographed the action and fight scenes is brilliant because the action is all very smart and well thought-out.\n\nWith a star as cool as Liam Neeson, and human trafficking bad guys asking to get their butts kicked, it's no surprise that I enjoyed \"Taken\" so much.  \"Taken\" is, by far, one of the best action films I've seen in a while, and one I'd be happy to watch again and again.",

            "content": "Taken is exactly what it is. Let's not kid ourselves, if you want a thinking man's action drama (or really anything above a simple action/revenge movie) then you're in the wrong place. But if you want to see Liam Neeson lay waste through the human trafficking underworld of Paris, well then look no further. When I finally saw this movie, I knew what to expect. I was not disappointed. There's a line from Iron Man 3 that completely sums up Taken: \"There's no politics here, it's just good old fashioned revenge.\"\r\n\r\nEx government operative Bryan Mills has retired in attempt to rekindle a relationship with his daughter, Kim. He is divorced, but on reasonably good terms with both his ex-wife and his daughter. After her 17th birthday, Kim decides that she wants to go to Paris. Though he is initially cautious, Bryan does eventually agree to let her go. And guess what ... Bryan's original concerns become realities. Kim is taken by an Albanian human trafficking ring. Obviously, everyone knows where the story goes from there. Bryan Mills is not a man to be taken lightly.\r\n\r\nMovies like this never get as popular as Taken has become. It's a simple summer action movie. Most of the time, these movies are enjoyed, but quickly forgotten. Taken (somehow) has gained a rather large cult following. The story definitely deserves credit in some areas. Its set up is quite excellent. We're introduced to a character we instantly invest in, and we're given a situation that clearly plays into our hero's strengths. From there it becomes more of a straight action movie. But the set up deserves props for actually gripping the audience. I guess this basic story of a father out for revenge has struck a chord with audiences. Also, Liam Neeson.\r\n\r\nIt's as simple as this, Liam Neeson is a cool actor given a role that is perfect for him. That's why Taken is such a success. If it had been anyone else in this role, like Colin Farrell, Mark Ruffalo, or even someone like Jason Statham, I highly doubt this movie would have been very popular at all. But it all works because of ... Liam Neeson! He is truly epic as Bryan Mills. The performance is quickly becoming iconic, as is his classic telephone threat. Both physically and emotionally, Neeson nails it.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast members all do a fine job of filling their slots. Maggie Grace does an excellent job playing Kim. Sadly, she completely disappears after the action starts though. She does look a bit old for the part; I think she was around 25 at the time, playing a 17 year old. The scene where she is \"taken\" is very well acted. Also, Famke Janssen of X-Men fame is decent as Lenore, Bryan's ex-wife. Though I was struck by how rote the character felt.\r\n\r\nThe action functions well thanks to a genuine element of surprise. Once the Albanians take Kim, all bets are off. Bryan shows no mercy, something rarely seen in action movie protagonists. He has no problem killing ... and the body count in this movie is exceptionally high. Still, the action is entertaining, well shot, and well choreographed. We, the audience, want to see Bryan annihilate the scum that kidnapped his daughter. There is payoff after payoff in that regard. The closest parallel I can draw to this movie is 24. Swap out Bryan Mills for Jack Bauer, and you have yourself a 24 movie. You don't even have to change the name of the daughter. \r\n\r\nTaken: A cult classic? Check. A thrilling action/revenge movie? Check. Liam Neeson at his action movie finest? Check. An overall entertaining and fun movie? Check. A smart story? Nope. Character development? Nope. Clever twist and turns in the story? Nope. Bryan Mills will find you, and he will kill you. That's the movie. It's clearly heavier on action payoffs than plot. But I just can't not like Taken. \r\n\r\n\"You don't remember me? We spoke on the phone...I told you I would find you.\" 6.5/10",

            "content": "\"Taken... to the limit, taken... to the limit, taken... to the limit... one more time!\" Actually, now that I kind of think about it, Liam Neeson kind of looks like an actual eagle (It's only fitting, because that is one awesome bird and one awesome dude), and by extension, the musician Eagle Joe Walsh, so now I kind of want to see a biopic of the Eagles that features Neeson as Walsh, even though casting conflicts enter within the fact that life has not exactly been all that good to Neeson so far, what with his daughter getting kidnapped and whatnot. Well, then again, it's nice to get a break from the kids sometimes, especially when those kids are teenagers, and besides, this film is pretty much \"24: The Movie\", so Neeson's Bryan Mills character has a whole TV season to wrap up his day off. Shoot, maybe that's this film's real premise, and Mills, not really wanting to look like a bad father, is just pretending that his main objective is to rescue his daughter, when really, he just wanted an excuse to get a vacation to Paris and explore his favorite hobby: killing people, which would make sense, because Liam Neeson is so hardcore that I can see him killing people Jason Bourne style for an afternoon exercise session, and because Mills kills so many people in this film that it just has to be some kind of morbid sense of entertainment... for someone other than a viewer of this film. Good gracious, this French film is so outrageously American that I'm baffled that it took almost an entire year for to get over here, though, for Luc Besson, this is practically a Cannes Film Festival entry, and he's pretty much the only popular French filmmaker who doesn't submit every film he makes to the Cannes Film Festival. Hey, Luc, mon homme, I'll take it, because this is decidedly more exciting than your typical French flick, even if it does get to be too much of your typical American flick. Don't get me wrong, this film is fun and all (A man violently killing people in order to rescue his virgin teenaged daughter who is kidnapped for sex trafficking; sounds delightful), but not even Liam Neeson can take out film flaws, no matter how much you would tell him otherwise in fear of him killing you for insulting his awesomeness.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else has been praised about this film time and again, it is its entertainment value, and sure, the film is plenty of fun on the whole, yet, as with plenty of modern thrillers of this type, there are, in fact, occasions that are anything but all that thrilling, in that they devolve into a bit of quietness and a sudden limpness in pacing that slow down momentum, and sometimes dull things down. Sure, the moments in which the film really limps out are few and far between, but they are here, and they stand as heights in the blandness that I wish I could say is hardly anywhere to be found, but backs most of the slow-downs in this thriller's momentum, while plenty of the other slow-downs go accompanied by \"dramatic\" attempts that are about as disengaging as the relatively slower moments. I wasn't exactly going into this formulaic action thriller expecting all that much depth, but certain areas of the substance within this stylish flick all too often go tainted by subtlety issues, reinforced by overbearing areas in Nathaniel Mechaly's slightly cheesy, when not obnoxiously overstylized score, but truly ignited by limited care in the handling of depth. Sure, there's a certain sharpness to the depth limitations of this film, as the final product feels more like a no-bull thriller, rather than downright dumb, and I respect it for its audacity, yet few of the moments in which the film actually tries as something dramatic or especially substance-driven truly work as well as they should, partially because director Pierre Morel tries a bit too hard, and largely because the film is, on the whole, bent on intentionally undercooking its substance for the sake of style, resulting in limited care in development and even less care in genuine uniqueness. If nothing else can be complained about in this film, it is, of course, the genericism, because with all of its highlights, this thriller, at the end of the day, is run-of-the-mill in more than a few key areas, hitting one too many of the glaring tropes that we've come to associate with the traditional formula of modern action thrillers of this nature, which would be fine and all, I guess, if such a formula wasn't, by its own right, tainted with natural shortcomings. The film is what it is, complete with superficiality, and that really distances your investment, something that this film clearly didn't want too much of, but would still be needed if this film was ever to escape the underwhelmingness that unfortunately claims it at the end of the day. With that being said, for what it is, this film does its job reasonably well, being riddled with shortcomings, but made quite enjoyable by plenty of style, even that of a visual nature.\r\n\r\nOkay, perhaps Michel Abramowicz's cinematography isn't all that terribly impressive as a component to visual style, doing only so much that's visually unique, and only so much that's striking when relative uniqueness is, in fact, played upon, but make no mistake, the particularly sharp areas in Abramowicz's photographic eye are indeed striking to some degree, having a very rich and dynamic palette that makes the well-lit explorations of certain colors in certain settings gritty, if not tasteful in a very French fashion that catches your eyes almost as much as another stylish aspect that wouldn't be as impressive as it is without clever filming methods. Okay, perhaps I might have made a slight error when I opened the previous paragraph by boasting that it's the entertainment that is most celebrated by critics and viewers, because what everyone and their grandmother are complimenting the most is a component to the entertainment value, and that is, of course, the action, which is nothing if not upstanding, with intricate and dynamic staging and slick and focused, yet harshly realistic choreography, both of which go complimented by such clever technical aspects as snappy editing - courtesy of FrÃ©dÃ©ric Thoraval - and immersive sound design and filming. When I said that this film doesn't mess around, I meant that it doesn't mess around, at least not when the going gets tough, because when the tension has settled, the film isn't as juicy as it probably should be if it wants to be consistently gripping, regardless of substance shortcomings, though the action is slick, and the technical and stylistic compliments to the thrills are worthy, thus making the film relatively successful as a hard-edge popcorn piece. As a dramatically meaty thriller, the final product isn't what it could have been, partially because it doesn't seem to want to achieve its full potential, yet even then, the substance at the core of this thriller is hardly dry, as this subject matter, while formulaic, is genuinely intriguing, with a heavy sense of consequence and a bit of entertaining intricacy that grace the progress of this layered chase thriller with a certain weight that reinforces your investment in the thriller. Sure, investment isn't all that firmly secured, but there are certain key areas in storytelling that make sure that you never forget the weight of this, in some areas, reasonably bright thriller, and when it comes to the more superficial aspects of the final product, their no-nonsense attitude is kind of charming, when not rather engrossing as fairly entertaining, so as a popcorn flick, the final product succeeds, with a few genuinely compelling spots that are truly anchored by something that carries this film as much as anything. The film's story is a very intense one, with high consequence and high intrigue, at least on paper, so there's plenty of potential for good acting, and sure enough, when the performances hit, they hit harder than expected, with leading man Liam Neeson particularly standing out, not just with charisma, but with gripping effectiveness to a layered and intense portrayal of a dangerously unpredictable man on a mission who will stop at nothing to exact what he believes to be justice. Neeson's Bryan Mills character does some seriously low-down and dirty deeds that would be too questionable to be engaging if the character was backed by a less competent performer, but Neeson shows why this film made him the action megastar he has become in recent years, as his chilling commitment cuts to the depths of Mills and leaves you to see an ultimately well-intentioned, but brutally audacious man, and by extension, a lead so layered and compelling that he's almost more than this film deserves, and decidedly one of the primary components to this effort's engagement value, which is shaken throughout the final product's course, but still stands firm enough to make this popcorn thriller a decent one.\r\n\r\nOverall, there are unexpected slow spells to slow down entertainment value's momentum, as well as subtlety issues to slow down dramatic momentum, which is hurt enough by the film's limited development and originality as a formulaic action thriller, complete with natural shortcomings that make the final product underwhelming, but not without enough engagement value - brought to life by such relatively light touches as handsome photography, and by such more notable aspects as thrilling action, an intriguing story concept, and compelling performances, the most compelling of which being by effective leading man Liam Neeson - to make Luc Besson's and Pierre Morel's \"Taken\", or, as I sometimes like to call it, \"Pris\" (Really, Luc, you don't even have enough faithfulness to your own film culture to have a French alternative title?), a consistently decent thriller, with some sharp highlights to meet plenty of underwhelming areas.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

We meet ex-CIA Brian Mills (Liam Neeson) his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), and their daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). When Kim goes off to Paris with her friend, they get abducted, and brought into human trafficking. Any parent, and anyone who feels for another, wouldn't really feel they could blame Brian for what he does to get Kim back. I must warn you, what he does is pretty over-the-top for a PG-13 movie. (I can only imagine the unrated edition) Nathaniel Mechaly provides an appropriate, as well as intense score to the soundtrack. For a 90 minute movie, this one actually breathes a little. The dialogue contains large amounts of profanity for PG-13, but under the depicted circumstances, don't blame them. Overall, Pierre Morel provides an exciting, intense film that'll leave you shocked.",

So, it all comes down to how well and different it is executed.  I think Taken is executed fairly decently.  Though, this is mainly due to Liam Neeson and his performance, like in the famous telephone scene.  Without Neeson, this movie would not be nearly as enjoyable. \n\nThe acting is alright.  No one did a bad job performance wise.  The only character worth talking about is Bryan Mills, played by Liam Neeson.  He is very likable, very driven, and kicks ass.  There are times were he comes off very mean and extreme.  However, I still liked him as a character, because of his situation.  I'm glad he came out on top in the end.  The rest of the characters are bland.  Maggie Grace's character is the typical teenage girl that gets kidnapped.  I did kind of feel for her, but not much, because I barely got to know her.  Famke Janssen, I did not care for at all.  She did nothing, and was very mean throughout most of the film.  The villains, I thought, were kind of nothing villains.  I did not find them intimidating.\n\nThe film does move at a good pace.  The action scenes are fun and well-choreographed.  The final fight I really enjoyed.\n\nOverall this is a generic, but fun action movie.  Its saving grace is definitely Liam Neeson and his character.  I recommend this to people who are fans of action movies.  Those who are not fans of action films, I would skip this.",

            "content": "There seems to be quite a few action films of late, which I always end up comparing with The Bourne Identity, and James Bond, and on this basis, I'd say this is up there with them both. It's not a role one is used to seeing Liam Neeson play, partly because he's been quite a diverse actor, but it's a genre which he's executed reasonably well given that he wouldn't be everyone's first choice for a leading role in a close combat / shoot em up thriller. It's a relatively easy concept to follow - Daughter goes to Paris and is kidnaped by a foreign gang, intent on drugging girls to use as prostitutes for their illegal business. Father then starts a one man rescue mission destroying everyone and everything that stands in his way of getting his child back. Of course it's fantastically unrealistic in the sense that an ageing actor can tear through hundreds of armed villains without a) being captured, or b) being killed, but that's all just part of the fun, as it gives us someone to root for for the entire duration. It is largely predictable in terms of whats going to happen when a couple of girls go travelling solo, and we also know how it's going to end in that typical fairy tale style ending when family's who had strained relations at the beginning, soon grow a closer bond once their only child has been used as a porn in a sex ring. For this reason the entertainment is all about how you get from A to B, and the middle section of this was full of action aplenty, with several twists and turns which kept us glued up until that well anticipated conclusion. It's not anything greatly original but it is a bundle of fun to give it it's dues. I won't rush to see the sequel, but I won't overlook the opportunity to watch it either - I'll just see it when I see it!",

It wasn't very complicated, it has certainly stretched the imagination of the viewers. The phone calls that were made in the film were simply incredible. The stunts were pretty good too. Some of it were a little over the edge which I think were not really believable to anyone but still, it didn't harm the overall impact of the film to the audience.

            "content": "TAKEN is a simple action movie about a family man with \"a particular set of skills\" that takes down a sex trafficking ring in order to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped while on holiday in Paris. While this could have gone straight to the bargain bin, what really sells this movie is Liam Neeson, who brings a everyman quality to his role as Bryan Mills. The production values by Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel are also worth noting, with just enough emotional content to make the story relatable and a kinetic style that keeps things moving along at a good pace. Generally speaking everyone gives a decent performance, but I thought that Maggie Grace was miscast as she doesn't look the part of a 17-year-old girl, and her acting is questionable at best. Story-wise, I did appreciate that the movie took time to establish characters and relationships before heading off into more standard action thriller territory but, that being said, it only taps into the basest of human emotions and tendencies. Only someone devoid of empathy wouldn't understand the sticky situation that the characters are put into. Still, despite the rote nature of the setup it works, and the latter two-thirds of the movie rarely let up. As far as the action is concerned, it is well-shot for the most part. Pierre Morel shoots the close quarters combat up close, but the editing isn't so bad that you can't tell who's fighting who, and the geography and shot compositions are decent. If there's one complaint I have in this area is a nighttime car chase which was perhaps a bit too chaotically shot/edited. Overall, this is a decent time-passer that has enough story and thrills to keep you interested, and the running time is only about 90 minutes so it never overstays it's welcome.",

            "content": "In my review of Unknown 18 months ago, I spoke about how actors can often have a second, very different career after their initial fame or recognition has passed. In addition to the examples I listed in that review, along with all of John Travolta's comebacks, we can now add Liam Neeson to the list of actors whose later career is taking a very different shape to the roles which made him famous.\n\nTaken is the result of two growing trends in filmmaking: older protagonists as a reaction to a market saturated with youth, and weighty actors downsizing into trashy B-movies. Even considering how clichÃ©d the premise is, it should be fun to see the star of Schindler's List and Michael Collins run around beating up men half his age. But what starts as a fun if overly familiar thriller eventually descends into something a lot more nasty, so that the end result is just plain and simple rubbish.\n\nThe film starts fine enough, with a number of scenes which set up our main characters and make them likeable. The characters are all painted in very broad strokes, with the likeability coming from the screen presence of the actors rather than the lines they are delivering. The setup is clichÃ©d and contrived, revolving around a retired special agent who has family problems, and whose friends are also retired agents who moonlight at bodyguards. But Liam Neeson and Famke Janssen both have enough screen presence to make us feel engaged, if not impressed.\n\nThe other big asset of Taken is its pacing. It is paced as a B-movie should be, clocking in at just under 90 minutes and moving from scene to scene like it is trying to get a job done. The film is produced by Luc Besson, and whatever else may be true of him, he does not make films that hang around unnecessarily. The action, up to the hour mark at least, hits all the beats that it needs to and cutting from scene to scene at just the right time. Pierre Morel compliments Besson very well, bringing a Hollywood sensibility without too much of the accompanying excess.\n\nAs efficient as Taken is, however, it is also deeply derivative. I've spoken in the past about the difference between a clichÃ© and a convention, the key being that if we are engrossed enough in the story or the action, then the more well-worn elements are less likely to bother us. Considering how fast-paced and lean Taken is, you'd expect these familiar touches to be easy to ignore or gloss over, but they are often so blatantly obvious that this becomes impossible.\n\nFor starters, the camerawork is incredibly sub-Bourne, relying on very clumsy hand-held work and needless choppy editing during the car chases. Like many filmmakers who have aped the style of the Bourne series, Morel seems to understand how to achieve the effect but doesn't understand what the effect is for. Paul Greengrass used handheld camerawork to bring a realistic, documentarian feel to the Bourne films; the action was directed in such a way that it felt spontaneous and visceral. With Taken, there is so much artifice in the set-up and plot mechanics that this technique doesn't work, resulting in nothing more than visual incoherence.\n\nWhile many B-movies recycle plots from films at or below their station, this film pinches plot points from more upmarket films, perhaps in a bid to give itself mainstream credibility. The scene where Neeson uses a photo booth to enlarge a photo of the kidnapper's face is a shameless rip-off of Blade Runner, recreating the shot with none of the intrigue or patience. The interpreter who appears very briefly is a straight lift from the Sherlock Holmes story 'The Greek Interpreter', being a character who is asked to interpret without knowing where he is, what he is doing or why. The death scene involving the bulldozer is essentially a reworking of the ridiculous surfboard death in Lethal Weapon 2, and the recurring mention of \"good luck\" is a clunking and ineffective nod to The Great Escape.\n\nThen we come to the film's casual racism, evident in its characterisation of Europeans. Despite its modern camerawork and aesthetic, it is a very old-fashioned, retrograde thriller in which anyone who doesn't come from America is simply evil. The film focuses a lot of its energy on the Albanians, stereotyping them as vicious human traffickers with an overlord so silly, he could have come straight from a Tintin comic. But the French are also slandered, with the main French character being cowardly, corrupt and never more than a few yards from either wine or a baguette.\n\nYou might make the point at this juncture that this kind of stereotyping simply comes with the territory. B-movies have often depicted American protagonists fighting other races under the banner of entertainment, a trend which has carried over to the mainstream via Raiders of the Lost Ark. The difference, however, is that Raiders doesn't play the Nazis' race for laughs: Indiana Jones could be punching hundreds of bad Americans out and it would still be awesome. Taken actively relies on the foreign nature of its bad guys, using racial stereotypes to reinforce its protagonist in the absence of any more developed story or characterisations.\n\nUp to the hour mark, what we have is a stupid, derivative and racist but efficiently made action thriller. The action is very paint-by-numbers, and the camerawork is poor, but there's enough humour and silliness to keep us entertained. The enjoyment we get from Neeson and the slick execution is in such abundance that the film is a borderline guilty pleasure. And then we come to the torture scene, after which the film takes a nose dive and never recovers.\n\nThere has been an awful lot of press recently about the depiction of torture in films, particularly in regard to Zero Dark Thirty and whether it condones or condemns the use of torture. In the case of Taken, there can be no such debates: the film blatantly condones torture as a means of getting information, and then throws in a touch of sadism by having our hero leave the victim to slowly fry. This scene has none of the humour of the torture scene in Casino Royale, or even Reservoir Dogs: it leaves a really nasty taste in the mouth and goes somewhere to alienating our protagonist.\n\nAfter this scene, the sleazier parts of Taken start to bother us more. The film shoots itself in the foot in this regard, cranking up both the body count and the scenes of scantily-clad women. We're meant to feel like the stakes are being raised, but all that's different is that we now deeply dislike Neeson's character. He has gone from someone doing what he must to a vengeful and vindictive murderer, and there is no Get Carter-style twist to mitigate just how reprehensible he's being.\n\nThe film's attempts to up the ante with the action also betray even more derivative aspects. Having put up with certain scenes or character traits up to this point, we know begin to pick up on shots or compositions that the film recycles from better genre movies. The Albanians' derivative deaths range from having their heads slammed in car doors (Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) to being hit in the head repeatedly with a fire extinguisher (Irreversible). The scene of the different mobsters bidding on the girls feels like the underground executive scene in Mulholland Drive, but without any of the intelligence, the intrigue or the mystery. Having already lost its audience, the film proves that it doesn't have an original bone in its body, being in every way, shape or form the product of a hack.\n\nTaken is a really poor action film that fails to fulfil on what little potential it possessed. While its pacing is laudable and its performances are initially likeable, all the problems which bubble under the surface at the start are thrust wide into the open after the torture scene, after which it has nowhere to go. Neeson give it his all, but there is a bittersweetness here too, considering the direction this film has led him down in his later career. In short, it's awful - and it has an awful lot to answer for.",

The few people giving this a 1 or 2 star rating must be disgruntled French people who do not like to see the French government officials portrayed as corrupt bastards (which they often are anyway).\n\nI generally like Liam Neeson so the fact that he is in the movie kind of got the movie off to a good start already. In this movie he plays a real badass, I-kick-the-shit-out-of-anyone-standing-in-my-way, former CIA agent hunting down the despicable low-life that kidnapped his daughter. I really, really liked the role he played in this movie. He makes characters like Bourne look like wussy. Even I was surprised when he actually shot the wife of the corrupt French government bastard to get him to talk. That was just awesome.\n\nThe movie is pretty much action all the way. Well, it starts off laying the groundwork for the story and here Liam Neeson is indeed playing a fairly timid father that seems to be a bit out of his depth. Once he gets thrown into his right element he quickly casts of the sheep's fur and reveals the wolf (sabre-toothed) underneath.\n\nThis is really a textbook action/thriller movie.

I love watching evil bad guys get their comeuppance but there isn't much time spent on any character other than the protagonist so you don't feel a great deal of satisfaction when he kills any of them. It's formulaic and predictable but there is some marginally exciting stuff to enjoy.",

Action was top notch, but can only take a movie so far. I couldn't stand his daughter. I almost wanted the Albanians(or whatever the hell they were) kill her. Why did she run like a kid with Down syndrome? It took me all this time to watch it, and I honestly wish I never would have. I in no way want to see the sequel now.",
