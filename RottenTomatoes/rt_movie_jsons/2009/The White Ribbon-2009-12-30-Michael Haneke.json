    "summary": "Using their social status and harsh punishments, a baron (Ulrich Tukur), a doctor (Rainer Bock) and a pastor (Burghart Klaussner) rule over a small German village. One day, the doctor falls off his horse after it trips over a wire strung between two trees. More pranks follow, seemingly without reason, all directed at the village's upper class and growing increasingly more brutal with time. There are no suspects, but a local schoolteacher (Christian Friedel) has his suspicions.",

It's a bit bleak - indeed its in black and white. It's somewhat thoughtful but not a very cheery film, of course. If you like this sort of world cinema then you may enjoy it but otherwise I wouldn't especially recommend it as such, no.",

            "content": "Alternative title: 'Children of the Cabbages'. Think Stephen King meets Ingmar Bergman. \n\nThe White Ribbon is a film about human evil, told in many forms - cold indifference, a lack of empathy, excessive self-importance at the expense of others, perception, cruelty, and religious vigor to name a few. It doesn't exactly take a stance against these actions, avoiding painting any one character as a bulwark against the tide of hate, which is part of the point - anger begets anger and violence begets violence in a cycle that is essentially unbreakable. The black and white cinematography emphasizes the brutal nature of this fictional village that seems like a sort of hell, just one with a veneer of gentility and manners. The warmer aspects of humanity are deliberately snuffed out on as a matter of social practice, whether because of a priest's piety or a schoolteacher's rigidness. Sharply shot and featuirng some very good performances from its cohort of child actors, The White Ribbon is one of Haneke's more grounded (but not necessarily accessible) films, trading in his traditional fields of estrangement but with a morose, often unnerving atmosphere. But hey, he's bleak because there's often plenty of distressing material when you take a look at human nature.\n\nApparently Christian Berger was nominated for the Oscar for Best Cinematography for this film. Which is odd, because looking at it you'd think Andrew Wyeth had come back from the dead to frame the imagery, but in a motion picture set in Germany for some reason. (4/5)",

Set in a small German village prior to World War I, violent occurrences disrupt the inhabitants desire to maintain purity and innocence among the children, a taciturn group living under the iron fists of their guardians.  At times cruel and heart-breaking, the movie taps into the basic primal need to be loved or, at the very least, wanted.  Haneke allows shots to patiently run longer than one would normally expect, which is fine since the black and white cinematography is nothing short of stunning.  Despite its slow pace, attention is required throughout in order to keep track of the large number of characters, all of whom play an integral role in the tapestry that is The White Ribbon.",

            "content": "Born in Munich in 1942, Austrian director Michael Haneke has consolidated in recent times as one of the greatest exponents of European cinema. Renowned for his gloomy and disturbing style, Haneke delves into the dark human nature and the discomfort that it produces, and he often takes violence as a starting point. Haneke has acclaimed films in his repertoire, such as \"Funny Games\"(1997), \"La Pianiste\" (2001), or \"Amour\" (2012), which are essential to understand the keys and the development of his style. The vast majority agrees that The White Ribbon (‚ÄòDas Weisse Band') is his definitive film. A rather unknown but true masterpiece of contemporary cinema.\n\nFilmed in beautiful black and white, The White Ribbon is narrated entirely by the unnamed teacher (Christian Friedel) of a small German village in a time set just before the First World War. The opening scene shows the village doctor (Rainer Bock) suffering an accident on his horse, when he races into a rope that strangers stretched around two trees close to his house. There is neither an explanation nor a suspect for this event, that inaugurates a spiral of unbridled violence, which includes abuse towards women and children, animal abuse, and the unfolding of guilt and shame, with the incessant reminder of a white ribbon as a symbol of innocence and purity.\n\nThe baron (Ulrich Tukur) acts as a feudal lord with his employees, and begins to exercise brutal domestic violence against his wife (Ursina Laudi), who tolerates his humiliations. Similar stories of marital ruptures and verbal / sexual abuse of minors, are just some of the atrocities that begin to happen in several homes of the town, and each story is described with chilling coldness and brutal despair.\n\nThe whole set develops a micro universe that gives a preview of the German society that would come to reality 20 years later- when the children of the town reach maturity, they will transform their harsh reality into something tremendously sinister. Haneke does a profound and detailed research on the roots of a certain type of evil. Hypocrisy and irrelevance begin to grow inside the town, and the disaster begins to unfold.\n\nDeliberately, the film invites viewers into every corner of the town, from its huge mansion to its humblest home, finding in each one an air of restlessness and bewilderment. The \"perfection\" of the houses and the cordiality that the villagers display to the outside only hides the overwhelming darkness being lived inside. The behavior of the children participating in the film is fiercely analyzed and thoroughly absorbed. They are tremendously subdued small human beings, brutally indoctrinated by their elders. But they are also not innocent- they do as they see and are being told.\n\nAlthough the film has been interpreted as a representation of the origins of German fascism, Haneke is actually showing us the brutal consequences of abuse and authoritarianism in general, as well as the religious ‚Äì specifically evangelical- intolerance and indoctrination that always existed. While The White Ribbon provides no final or easy answers, the film gives us a sublime and lucid experience in which one fundamental answer is raised to many of the problems and crimes that have been destroying our society since the last century. We are still immersed in a society unable to debate and find strong solutions, a society that is surprised and indignated of the atrocities that are committed everyday in the world. These events are the result and the consequences of the seed that has been sown. Haneke seems to argue that, until another great confrontation of nations happens, we will not realize the seriousness of the situation, that we are inside a pot that is about to explode.\n\nThe White Ribbon is a gigantic artistic reflection that robs us from the false belief that we didn't see it coming, that we don't know the cause of evil. We are reluctant to look inwards, and the comfort of looking away prevents us from changing things,which leads to irremediable consequences. \n\nhttps://vinylwriters.com/the-white-ribbon-2009/",

He wrote and directed films such as Cach√©, The Piano Teacher, and both the original and remake of Funny Games. The film follows how a strange event in a small Austrian village in 1913 can cause so much suffering to a few local families. The best thing Michael can do in his films are tone. Michael always uses almost to no musical scores to create this eerie silent atmosphere. There‚Äôs no use music to give the audience a moment of relief, or to remind them that what‚Äôs happening on the screen isn‚Äôt real. Like usual, the cast did a fantastic job and their characters were amazingly written. Michael knows how to direct his casts, and write fully fleshed characters. I could be wrong on the acting because the film is entirely spoken in German and I cannot fully tell if the cast is saying their lines at the right tone or pronouncing them right, so I mostly judge on their body language and facial expressions. The White Ribbon is another masterpiece from Michael Haneke, and it became one of my favorite foreign language films and it could even be one of the best I‚Äôve seen.",

What we see is a mixture of the truth, lies or rumors. It ends on a cold note with nothing ever answered, and these nothing quite like it.\n\n\"The White Ribbon\" is another masterpiece from the brilliant Michael Haneke. The grim atmosphere and the re-creation of the time period is it's own achievement. Haneke is the best living film making of this decade. He's one of the few filmmakers right now that creates such compelling stories and questions with no answers, but questions that many will be thinking long after it's over.\n\nThe performances from the children was both fantastic and natural. The childlike behavior and the little innocence felt real. And for someone who's a sucker for amazing cinematography, this movie has it. Every singe shot is framed so perfectly that you could easily take any shot from the film and make it as the poster.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you can find something new with repeat viewings.

Anyone who are aware about German history won't appreciate this film as much since they were just a fighting empire at that time meaning that Germany was not ruled by Adolf Hitler so for the director to imply that Germany became fascist even before the first world war is incorrect.  I mean if that was the case critically acclaim German directors such as Fritz Lang and Georg Wilhelm Pabst, Ernst Lubitsch and F.W. Murnau would not be allowed to make the movies that they made and were made during the time of World War 1.  But even by watching it, the experience overall is still very talky without much action which many or most of the key events are implied rather than shown.  \r\n\r\nThe story centers on a small remote little village with one church. We see a doctor riding into the village while on a horse.  The horse then trips over a wire throwing the doctor to the ground.  This is the only action sequence anyone is going to see throughout the entire film. Once the judicial officer is there he's then asks around to know the culprit or culprits who placed that wire and then remove it once coming over there.  No one says anything evoking just brain dead speculations, even when this officer asks on front of the church. Two weeks later the wife of a famer gets killed while going into a barn.  Viewers are shown a hole and some personal blame is being placed toward the baron of the village since it's being said that he intended for that to happen. Then we also see children being punished by their father for not coming home right away for going to another village provoking the mother to frantically looking for them. And it is during at that time we get to know why the film is called \"White Ribbon\" for it's what this particular father does whenever some of his kids does bad things. He ties some of them a white ribbon either to the boys arm or to each of their daughters long hair so that it could remind them not to commit any practice any bad things, which as we watch the movie further does absolutely nothing.   And that all of that narration that is being done by a young ambitious school teacher can't seem to do anything either for he can just be as dense everyone else in the village.   The director Michael Haneke only suggested that German fascism can evolve from this little village without having to say that it can mean much more than such as poverty and economic structure.   We don't even get to see how children are even taught in this school since discipline comes in all shapes and sizes including from education.  From looking at the big picture kids can never be smarter than adults but that seems to be the case in this film.   From a running time of more than two hours, we don't even get to see how they celebrate birthdays nor any sincerity which I'm sure even during Hitler's regime of WWII, there were many Germans who didn't agree with Hitler's ideals but have to go along with it anyway since people were too poor to move nor did they never get a chance to do so, for to join in his army was a requirement by Hitler himself to fight on his cause.   This is not really a revelation only another speculation he may have heard or told about before.     \r\n\"The White Ribbon\" gained and Oscar nomination is still an interesting film but at the same time can also be very boring.\r\n\r\n2.5 out of 4 stars",

I ragazzini sono percossi con la verga per motivi piuttosto futili, vengono commessi degli omicidi del tutto inusuali tra i braccianti agricoli, ed il medico del villaggio si concede delle abberranti trasgressioni tra le giovanissime fanciulle che alloggiano nella sua dimora. I peccati commessi verranno poi \"purgati\" da un nastro bianco allacciato alle braccia dei ragazzini pi√π insolenti, ma questo non dopo aver esercitato su di loro una sana e dolorosa punizione corporale dal Pastore losco della chiesa protestante dell'abitato. Siamo nel 1913, alle porte del primo conflitto mondiale, ed il clima che si respira √® palesemente ostile. Haneke tuttavia non vuole necessariamente mettere in luce solo quelle condotte autoritarie e classiste che tratteggiarono a grandi linee le prime caratteristiche del movimento fascista e nazional-socialista, ma ci mostra come, in una societ√† assolutista in cui le istituzioni usano il mezzo della minaccia religiosa per tenere a bada le intemperanze della comunit√†, e lo strumento della tortura come \"redenzione\" delle colpe, possano scattare facilmente quei meccanismi di perversione e prevaricazione che caratterizzeranno in seguito le ideologie estremisme e totalitarie del periodo appena antecedente alla Seconda guerra. Una costruzione spazio-temporale congrua al periodo storico, la quale artisticamente esprime un linguaggio smantellato da qualsiasi orpello cinematografico supplementare alla narrazione, garantisce uno spettacolo pragmaticamente brutale che si ripercuote sui testimoni come un pugno allo stomaco. Il regista austriaco riesce a tenere lo spettatore col cuore in gola attraverso un utilizzo conturbante del chiaroscuro in un b/n acuminato ed una location rurale efficientemente rappresentata nei suoi particolari; un realismo ancora pi√π intensificato da sottili movimenti di macchina da presa ed una \"staticit√†\" generale delle immagini, sempre prive di accompagnamenti musicali o illustrazioni esornative extra-diegetiche. Il messaggio di Haneke non √® \"critico\" e non ha una morale, ci fa semplicemente capire che nel momento in cui le \"cause\" verso cui si crede vengono tramandate ambiguamente e di coseguenza erroneamente declamate da menti vulnerabili (in questo caso, quelle dei bambini), i resoconti possono essere devastanti. Contenutisticamente il film √® bollato come \"disturbante per delle scene esplicite di violenza e morbosit√†\" ma queste vengono sempre riprese fuori campo; l'autore ha gi√† usufruito della stessa tecnica \"dissimulatoria\" nei suoi lavori precedenti.",

This is a project Haneke had planned for over a decade, originally pitched as a TV mini-series, but when no-one was interested, Haneke did it as a film, which he subtitled as 'A German Children's Story', a very odd one indeed. Set in a small Protestant community in North Germany in 1913 called Eichwald. This tells the various incidents and exploits that befall this community, which is run by a Baron (Ulrich Tukur), a Pastor (Burghart Klau√üner) and a Doctor (Rainer Bock), and they dictate the rules of the town to the women, children and local farmers. The Pastor makes pubescent children wear white ribbons as a sign of their innocence. But then, some unexplained events and accents happen in Eichwald, the Doctor suffers a fall from his horse, a barn at the Baron's barn burns down and then the Baron's son Sigmund (Fion Mutert) vanishes, only to be found later, severely caned as well. It's a film which has a touch of Werner Herzog about it with it's shots of nature and off-kilter characters. It requires a lot of patience, as it is a quiet and slow film, but if anything, this is a horror film in disguise, masquerading as a drama.",

But, isn't harsh, small-town protestantism as much a hallmark of Scandinavian countries as Germany, and didn't they essentially avoid the evils that plagued the modern transformation of Germany (as well as many other countries?)?  So what does that mean?  That means the conclusions Haneke draws are basically incorrect, that he's squaring a circle in a simplistic, mythological way, and that his cheap moralism will do little toward people understanding fascism.  This movie could have been good if it were broader in scope, say if it were more about the dark side of human nature/society in small town life akin to the American short story \"The Lottery,\" but it ends up being boring and fruitless.",

            "content": "This film is simple; and its understatement at the end is the only appropriate treatment. The extraordinary brutality, censoriousness and mental cruelty of a small village replicates in the next generation. The schoolteacher narrator (he is not a protagonist, and this is important) lacks effective status. He is not local. He is not a farmer and he is 30-ish but still unmarried. This leaves him dependent upon the local landowner for a decent supplement to his food and even the use of a bicycle. In this dependency he mirrors the rest of the population. But unlike them he is free to see what's happening. Except he does not see what we do: the viciousness and coldness meted out by the patriarchs of the village to their families behind closed doors. He only sees the consequences of this treatment and, free from ties or status, he can speak the unspeakable.\n\nWhen, at the end, he walks away from teaching and from the village (as we are told, not shown) he makes a case for abstention being a moral choice, perhaps the only moral choice. I do not agree  - but I have never seen this argument more eloquently put. This film foresees what Auden saw in the canyons of Manhattan on 'September 1 1939' and it has the supreme virtue of not over-screaming its hindsight. In Auden's words: \n\n'I and the public know, \nWhat all schoolchildren learn,\nThose to whom evil is done\nDo evil in return' \n\nSteven Rhodes",
