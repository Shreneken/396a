            "content": "La película trata de ser un resumen de lo ya visto en la primera serie de Dragon Ball, haciendo varios cambios. Partiendo desde el entrenamiento de Goku con el abuelo de Gohan, siguiendo con el encuentro con Bulma, Roshi y Yamcha, hasta la confrontación con Piccolo. Las únicas cosas buenas que destacó son el diseño de las esferas del dragón que están buenas, algunas escenas de acción, algunos efectos, el traje de Goku que a menos se parece un poco al original y al menos el diseño de Piccolo si lo hace ver como un alienígena. La actriz de Bulma no me pareció muy mala y Chow Yun-Fat es destacable, pero se queda corto en su papel como Roshi. Simplemente, ha habido muchos cambios que hacen que esta película derive mucho de Dragon Ball. Tenía posibilidades de ser algo bueno, ya que tenía como productores a Akira Toriyama y a Stephen Chow de Shaolin Soccer, pero el director escogido no era el indicado. James Wong es un buen cineasta por haber sido responsable de The One con Jet Li y la saga Final Destination, pero aun así él no era la persona ideal para dirigir esta película, ya que declaro jamás haber visto o leído algo de Dragon Ball, así que no sabía que estaba adaptando. Lamentablemente, esta película es sin duda una adaptación fallida y una tragedia para un anime tan emblemático como Dragon Ball. Mi calificación para esta película es un 5/10.",

After viewing I actually enjoyed this movie, now it has its flaws I don't see the movie as a live action Version of the anime series, I consider it its own film that does its own version of a live action adaptation of DragonBall Z and for what it's worth it's actually pretty good. Granted all the characters behave and act differently but as I treat the film as it's own thing a one off i liked the changes they made to suit a note realistic and live action format, the action is pretty neat to. So All in all if you don't count this film as a direct live action adaptation of the DragonBall anime and just treat as it's own film that does its own realistic live action version of DragonBall with a few nods to the anime series it's actually pretty decent.",

But I wish there's a scene here where there's a young boy who will touch Goku's Teenage Dragonballs on his jeans. I wonder how this American Teenage Goku will gonna react? Also when I was a 10 yr old gay kid back in 2009 I also wonder what underwear this Teenage Goku is wearing under his angsty punk Teenage pants and I wish they also showed a scene where Teenage Goku will take a shower and he will take off his clothes. As a gay kid back then I really wanna see how a Teenage boy are taking off their clothes and how they wear it again. No one can convinced me that young boys and Teen boys are wearing clothes and taking it off in the same way cause since I was a kid I knew that the way a young boy and a Teenage boy wear their clothes is very different and I also knew back then that Teenage boys also wears some clothes under the clothes that we see that the media and themselves never show to us.

Can't wait for the sequel of this movie because of the post-credit sequence. They call it sequel bait but instead, no one wants to direct it.",

The acting is terrible, the action is not very good, the special effects are laughably bad, there's a small romantic subplot between Goku and Chi Chi which is practically pointless and the dialogue is so, so cringy. It's almost as if the filmmakers saw a few production notes for Speed Racer and thought that that was all it took to make a beloved Japanese creation into a big-budget Hollywood flick.

If he dies, both Piccolo and the Dragonball disappear.\n2 Relationship between Goku and Piccolo. Both Goku and Piccolo fought in the Earth Marial Arts tournament. Both are Alien beings.

I could actually forgive everything about this movie if they didn't mess up the characters so bad. The film definitely had potential. And I question their decision to aim make it for a young demographic. I know that since I'm a grown man my opinion about how movies based on kids cartoons are made doesn't mean much, but when the show first came over to America in the early 90's I was one of the many kids watching it on YTV. Young people don't watch Dragon Ball Z these days, and especially not the original show which the movie is based on. The audience who watched Dragon Ball have grown up so I think it would have been better to make a more mature movie. They could make it mature and still get away with a PG rating. If the movie was more loyal to the show it would introduce a new audience to the great adventure and reward the die hard fans. The way they chose to make the movie just ended up confusing everybody.",

            "content": "With a full expectation that Dragonball: Evolution would be terrible, I went into it hoping for it to be a bad guilty pleasure.\n\nDragonball: Evolution instantly proves to be a pathetic whitewashed version of the popular anime series. The setting goes into a generic American teenager story setting in an attempt to establish a sense of comic relief. This is the beginning of the cheap and pathetic screenplay that plagues Dragonball: Evolution for the entire film.\nThe one thing I hoped for from Dragonball: Evolution is that it would be better than M. Nights Shyamalan's rendition of The Last Airbender. Although it is nowhere near as overblown or incompetent, Dragonball: Evolution still seems to follow the footsteps of that disaster. The entire film is basically just establishing the background story to an intended watered down version of the story, and it does it on such a desperately low scale that fans of the series are treated to an insultingly poor feature. There was no creative potential in Dragonball: Evolution from the start because the budget for the film is ridiculously insufficient. It is clear that the studio did not have faith in the film because if they did then the premise could have been a superior concept instead of limiting itself to such a small scale. \nWith a meagre budget of $30 million, Dragonball: Evolution only tells a severely limited story. It gets too caught up with shallow characters in an attempt to put depth into them ignoring the fact that it would have to have more meaning in the original screenplay before attempting to churn depth out of them. The screenplay is lazy and full of generic dialogue which is bereft of humour, so it gives no strong basis to the film from the beginning. But what is more surprising is just how cheap the entire feature ends up looking. With the scenery of the film being so pathetic, the costume and character design looking like they were borrowed from a Saturday Night Live sketch. Half the time the background of the film is composed from purely visual effects in scenes where the green screen is easy to identify, and that is when it looks its cheapest. The visual effects in Dragonball: Evolution are of a surprising poor quality due to the fact that they make the film look too animated whenever they are around. Considering that Dragonball: Evolution is a live action adaptation of a popular animated series, for it to look animated in its visual effects makes the live action nature of the feature seem even more arbitrary than it already is. The strange hybrid of cheap visual effects and weak live action setup in Dragonball: Evolution gives a all new meaning to the world cheap. It is strange to think about, but considering the distinctive lack of entertainment value in the film, it is not worth putting time or effort into actually considering the film.\nThere is minimal action in Dragonball: Evolution. Based on an anime series acclaimed for its over the top action, Dragonball: Evolution has next to none of it. The few action scenes in the film are spread out at a drastically sporadic rate as the film puts an abundance of fcus on a poorly conceived script which takes the story ridiculously seriously and lacks the iconic humour that the Dragonball universe is known for. Think about that for a second: Dragonball: Evolution is not only live action, but it is short on action and bereft of humour. If that doesn't scream terrible then I don't know what does. It doesn't just shout it though, because Dragonball: Evolution just pounds viewers over the head with its own incompetence. Centred by Ben Ramsey's pathetic screenplay and James Wong's mediocre directorial work, Dragonball: Evolution just falls into being exactly as bad as I could have imagined without the right kind of negativity that oculd have rendered it some form of guilty pleasure. I had at least hoped that there would perhaps be some kind of creatively choreographed action scenes in the film good for a brief burst of entertainment, but all the action was excessively tame, beyond my own belief. I could have choreographed better action for a YouTube video myself, but $30 million is not enough for James Wong to realise that the action in the film has to be good. It does not live up to that quality and only ends up succumbing to the cheap nature of the rest of the production surrounding the film. Frankly, there is no fun imagery in Dragonball: Evolution because everything just feels pathetic and lazy equally in terms of production values as it is in writing.\nAnd just when you think the screenplay and production values of the film were poor enough, the cast fail to illuminate the feature any better.\nJustin Chatwin is a pathetic lead. He is set up to fail from the start as he is a White actor portraying a Japanese warrior in the setting of a basic high school situation which is an all too common trope in every American film ever made. From there, his distinctive lack of charisma fails to illuminate the heroic elements of the character and his lack of comedic energy ensure that there is no laughter in his role. He is severly miscast, and he does not come off as a convincing warrior in the slightest so his performance wastes our time almost us much as it wastes his.\nJamie Chung is generic as well.\n\nSo thanks to poor acting, an incompetently unfunny screenplay, awfully misguided direction from James Wong and a general lack of fun whatsoever, Dragonball: Evolution does not have even the slightest resemblance to any of the positive characteristics that established a fan base for the franchise in the first place and instead insults them with this generic whitewashed edition of a smaller-budgeted crossover of  The Last Airbender and Double Dragon without even a hint of humour or entertaining action or imagery to sustain itself as a guilty pleasure",

It's not the best movie ever, and I don't believe it tried to be, but I can't deny it is very fun to watch and I really enjoyed it.\n\nNow, before I get crucified for stating that, these are the reasons I believe what I do:\n\nFirst, I believe people hated this movie because they expected \"Dragon Ball Z.\"  First mistake.  This movie is an adaptation of the Dragon Ball manga, so it's based on the events prior to its spin-off, Z.  With that out of the picture, expect to see Kid Goku, Bulma, Yamcha, Roshi, and Piccolo.. (Krillin did not make the cut into the final film.)  This movie is just as corny and goofy as the original source material, despite the detours with the storytelling that they took to make the movie it's own entity (makes sense, right?  Why try to fit an entire anime/manga series into a 2 hour mess, right Shyamalan?)  Now, the general story is the same:  Evil Piccolo is trying to destroy the earth.  Goku is tasked to do battle with Piccolo and save the earth. He is enlisted by Bulma to assist with finding the Dragon Balls because she wants to use them to grant her wish.  She attempts to take his 4-star ball that belonged to his grandfather,  but he will have none of that, however he does decide to help her (which is really a side plot similar to the actual manga/anime.\n\nIn most of these aspects, the movie gets it right.  Again, some events and things are changed to give it a contained and complete story for a single film.  The characters are pretty much the same as they were in the manga...except they are a little older...namely Goku and Chi-chi.  They are just as old as Bulma in this version (17-18ish) and all their personalities remained intact.  I can appreciate these things.  While some of the special effects were lack luster and obviously cartoonish, it was still pleasing to see what could be done on a 30mil budget for a film that likely required a 100mil budget.  In my opinion, this film is definitely worth a look-see.  It's not the best movie ever, but not a waste of time.  And I have seen worse.  I really enjoyed it.",

While the story does tend towards the right direction, giving exposition when it is needed, and moving the story forward at the right time, also Goku being learning something along the way. Overall, the narrative falls short in almost every way. What Goku improves upon is his martial arts skill, which is in keeping with the character, but he does not learn anything in moral area such as learning forgiveness, and offering Piccolo a senzu bean, or something. \nIts biggest insult to story telling though is the fact that there truly is no sense of urgency, or a true threat from Piccolo. Goku and Piccolo only fight in the climax, so we have no sense of Goku's ability concerning Piccolo and how much of a threat he truly is to our protagonist. Piccolo truly does nothing intimidating, or worthy of making him appear to be a threat to Goku. As a result, there is no reason for me to get involved with this story, because our heroes really do not feel to be in any real danger. \nAdaptation aside, Dragonball Evolution is a poor excuse for a film in the sense of a narrative, character development, and even visual effects. What is positive about the film is shattered by everything that is bad. The original sense of wonder and magic from the original series is gone, say for one and a few scenes, which makes this movie that much more insulting.

            "content": "Thanks to its rich universe that extends further than the original manga through other media such as anime series, anime movies, and video games, Dragon Ball has created a loyal and ever-growing international fanbase with a number that most other anime franchises could only dream of attaining. With a property this big, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood would try and cash in on it with a live action adaptation. It shouldn't have been difficult; all they needed to do was make an adventure story about a boy that searches around the world for seven magical, wish granting orbs and throw in some cool martial arts action, fun slapstick humor, and quirky yet memorable characters that the fans already held dear and newcomers could discover for the first time. Sadly, studio 20th Century Fox and director James Wong failed to deliver those expectations to audiences with their less than spectacular attempt in 2009, Dragonball: Evolution. With its uninspired writing, poor characterization, and reluctance to borrow many of the great elements from its source material, this poor excuse for a film not only shames the franchise of which it claims to be a part but the art of filmmaking itself.\n\tThe movie opens with a narration that describes how the evil Piccolo has recently broken free after being sealed away two thousand years ago for nearly destroying the world with help from his disciple, the monster Oozaru. The narrator goes on to describe the Dragon Balls, seven magical orbs that will grant whoever gathers them all one wish. After this intro, the protagonist, Son Goku, is introduced. It's Goku's eighteenth birthday, so his Grandpa Gohan gives him Shushinchuu, the Four Star Dragon Ball, as a gift. Gohan has actually been secretly teaching Goku martial arts as well as how to harness the mysterious power of ki but made Goku promise to never use his abilities to fight the boys at school. Consequently, Goku has no friends and always gets picked on by bullies. Goku has a crush on a girl named Chichi, and when she finds out about his martial arts prowess, she invites him to a party. While Goku is gone, Piccolo ransacks his home and kills his grandfather in search of Shushinchuu, with intentions to use it and the other Dragon Balls to extract revenge on the human race. Goku senses that something is wrong and rushes home. When Goku arrives, his dying grandfather tells him to seek training from Muten Roshi in addition to finding the remaining Dragon Balls before Piccolo. In addition to Muten Roshi, Goku meets a girl named Bulma, a gun-toting super genius, and Yamcha, a desert bandit that... er... doesn't do much. Goku even finds out that Chichi is also a skilled fighter when they bump into each other at a popular training ground. The heroes endure many trials during their journey, building up to a final confrontation against Piccolo in which Goku must face the harsh reality of his mysterious past.\n\tLike every bad movie, Dragonball: Evolution fails horribly in the writing department. The plot is bland and uninspired; it's more or less a mishmash of Spider-Man and The Forbidden Kingdom, complete with the high school bully scenes and the vomit-inducing premise of \"white teenager trains with martial arts masters to fight a great evil and even gets an Asian girlfriend!\" There isn't anything remotely interesting about the story whatsoever. One of the reasons for this is that the film is riddled with terrible clichés, including but not limited to the aforementioned bullies, not one, but TWO forced romances, a typical revenge story of Goku going after Piccolo for killing his grandfather, and a tired message of believing in oneself that's about as deep and intriguing as an after school special. \n\tAnother main issue with the plot is the amount of holes it has. First of all, how could Goku, being only eighteen, be Oozaru if Oozaru was Piccolo's disciple two thousand years before? Secondly, why did Muten Roshi wait until nighttime to jump out of the hole Yamcha made when he could have done so right away? Was it inconvenient for him? Well that's fine, because there's only an evil demon lord wrecking havoc. Besides, how did Bulma end up driving them into the hole in the first place when it was so huge that even Mr. Magoo would see it coming? Bulma probably shouldn't be behind the wheel with eyesight like that. Also, how exactly does Chichi find the time to balance her clearly fruitful social life with her hobby of martial arts and manage to keep that part of herself a secret? And finally, why didn't Goku use the Dragon Balls at the end of the film to bring everyone killed by Piccolo back to life instead of just Muten Roshi? Then he'd have his grandfather back, too!  None of this makes sense, and these aren't even all the inconsistencies this tripe contains! The sheer amount of plot holes shows how little care the writers had.\n\tA movie doesn't always need a spectacular story, however, so long as the characters are memorable. Sadly, this film can't even manage that. The characters are poorly written, one dimensional, and happen to have the names of Dragon Ball characters. This \"interpretation\" of Goku is a bad knockoff of Peter Parker, further supporting the notion that this movie is simply Kung-Fu Spider-Man. Goku doesn't only fail at being Peter Parker; he fails at having any likability whatsoever. He's whiny, emotional, and even somewhat creepy. The only thing this guy has going for him is his martial arts skills and the fact he makes a few one-liners (yeah, totally not Spider-Man) while \"not fighting\" the bullies. Of course, \"not fighting\" them means \"dodging them in such a way that they hurt themselves,\" which is pretty much fighting them. Goku's character isn't helped by the fact that the actor playing him, Justin Chatwin, isn't that great. Granted, he's definitely trying, but it's clearly not enough. It's obvious that he's not really crying when Gohan dies, his \"surfer dude\" accent is grating, and the way he delivers some of his lines are hilariously bad. Case in point would be this line: \"DRAGON! The test of seven has been fulfilled! I compel you to come forth and grant my wish!\" It's impossible to stifle one's laughter upon hearing that delivery. \n\tBulma's actress, Emmy Rossum, isn't bad; she certainly isn't great, but her performance is at least better than Chatwin's. The real problem with character lies within the writing; they try so hard to make Bulma an inspiring, butt-kicking female lead, but it ends up coming off as forced and one-dimensional. Making a woman an action hero alone doesn't empower her, especially if that's all there is to her character; it just creates new stereotypes to replace the old stereotypes. It doesn't even matter that much because Yamcha ends up saving her from Mai, Piccolo's henchwoman, during the last act anyway. Some woman-empowering role model she turned out to be.\n\tSpeaking of Yamcha, why was he even in this movie? The only useful things he did were saving Bulma as previously stated and loaning the heroes excavation tools to get to a Dragon Ball, which probably weren't even necessary due to the fact that Goku and Muten Roshi are two guys with superpowers that could have simply used their ki or punched their way through the rock. What else did Yamcha do? Be annoying? Well, with lines like, \"Got that from daytime TV,\" annoying is quite the understatement. The less said about the acting, the better. \n\tYamcha and Bulma even have a terribly executed romance in the form of their own clichéd scene: the classic \"almost kiss, but be interrupted\" moment. Was this romance necessary? There wasn't even an inkling of a hint of romance between the two at this point. In fact, this moment is actually the first time that these characters even have an actual conversation with each other. Did the producers actually expect the audience to believe that sad attempt at a romance?\n\tChichi falls into the same rut as Bulma by being written as a bad female action lead, with the only real difference being that she uses martial arts instead of guns. Again, this isn't a case of bad acting because Jamie Chung delivers a fair performance considering the script she was given. The writers simply tried too hard to make her kick butt and be an appealing love interest for Goku instead of giving her a real character. Though the romance between Goku and Chichi is done better than the Yamcha and Bulma's, it isn't by much. They don't really talk together, and when they do, they're almost always interrupted by the plot before the can have a real moment. When it comes down to it, Chichi only exists to be Goku's prize for beating up Piccolo in the end, and that doesn't make for a strong character at all.\n\tSurprisingly, there are actually interesting characters in this movie: Muten Roshi and Piccolo. Roshi is played by Chow Yun Fat, and he brings a lot of energy and fun to the role. James Marsters' Piccolo is menacing and cool, like he should be. However, these two characters share a common issue: they're extremely underutilized. There is plenty of Roshi throughout the film, but most of his screentime is spent on training Goku. It makes sense, but considering that he's one of the few interesting characters in the entire movie, one wishes that he could have had a little more focus. As for Piccolo, he definitely needed more screentime. With a bad guy as cool as him, why didn't they use him more? Come on, he even creates henchmen out of his own blood in one scene! That's awesome! Let's see him some more! Instead the audience is given the \"privilege\" of seeing the adventures of Goku Parker, Bulma Croft, and Butt-head with a little bit of Roshi and Sexual Object Girl.\n\tThe most irksome issue with this movie is the fact that the producers simply had so much material on which they could have based the film but utilize almost none of it. At the time, there were five hundred nineteen manga chapters, five hundred eight TV episodes, seventeen animated movies, various specials, and other derivative works. Having all of that from which they could have drawn ideas, one would think that they would at least get in the ballpark of a decent adaptation. Instead they created this monstrosity of a movie that is Dragon Ball in name only. Most of the problems with the characters could have been solved by basing them more on the versions from the series; instead, Goku is an unlikable version of Spider-Man as opposed to the goofy and naive kid at heart that mistakenly promised to marry Chichi because he thought marriage was food, Bulma is Spunky Action Heroine Number 1384 rather than an angsty teenage girl that develops into a strong, independent woman as the story progresses, and taking away Yamcha's martial arts prowess leaves him with even less dignity than he has in the series.\n\tOf course, there are references to things from the show here and there, such as the Mafuba, the Namekians, the concept of ki, the Oozaru, and Shen Long, but they come off as spitting in the fans' faces rather than being clever nods to the series considering that the movie goes out of its way to change things from the source material. These references are nothing more than a tease, constantly reminding the audience that this movie is supposed to be accurately representing the series they love, but it clearly isn't. There is so much wrong with this movie when compared to the source material that it would be pointless to list everything. The only thing they kind of did right was the final fight between Goku and Piccolo, and even then it's too short in length. It's a shame to see a property with so much potential be treated with such disrespect on the silver screen. Even the original manga author thinks the movie was \"no good,\" as he stated in the Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods Theatrical Pamphlet, which speaks volumes about the quality of this film.\n\tIn the end, Dragonball: Evolution is nothing short of an adaptation gone terribly wrong. Fox clearly didn't know what they were doing when they bought the rights to make this movie. The plot is weak, the characters are either one-dimensional or underused, and the film completely misses the point of Dragon Ball. It's an insult to the franchise, to filmmaking, and to moviegoers everywhere. This movie could have been a classic if it simply stuck to what Dragon Ball does best: being a fun adventure story. Sadly, Fox doesn't seem to see things that way. Maybe one day somebody will make a good Dragon Ball movie, but for now fans are stuck with Dragonball: Evolution. One can at least take comfort in knowing that the original series isn't going anywhere anytime soon, so this monumental cinematic failure can be forgotten along with the rest of the rubbish.",

            "content": "DragonBall and DragonBall Z are one of the best shows to ever hit the small screen.  Every fight, though it got a little repetitive, was enhanced through the deep mythology.  It has it's moments of pure adrenaline fueled fights, and it's deeply comical views on the world around us.  DragonBall GT was a step in the wrong direction, but DragonBall Evolution pretty much ended the chance of an epic live-action transfer.  It takes everything I loved about DBZ and pretty much ignores it.  So much so, that it could've been labeled \"Chinese Kung-Fu Beatdown\" or \"Shaolin  Kings\" or any other kung fu movie title, and I would believe it is a different film.  \n\nThe only star I recognized in this entire film prior to watching it was Chow Yun Fat as Master Muten Roshi.  This was a weird casting decision because I love Fat, but he looks too young (even though he's like 50) to play Roshi.  I can say that he was the best part of this film because he had a certain likability to him that I was fond of.  Unfortunately, the script (which I don't want to think about) was atrocious and let him down immensely.  Then, let's move on to our Son-Goku.  Mr. Justin Chatwin.  I hate this guy.  Every line he delivers is bland.  This guy also doesn't understand Goku's character and plays him like an emo.  Every look he gives makes me want to cut myself.  It doesn't help that he can't drop a tear at all.  Also, his \"Kamehameha\" deliver is laughable at best.  Much better than the nerds who attempt it in real life, but still weak.\n\nEverything seemed rushed in the movie and characters would just pop out of nowhere and decide to join together to beat Piccolo. The love angle in the story seemed forced as well, everybody was simply out of character. Goku's a powerful but lame school boy, Chi Chi's a martial art school girl who can't even open her own locker, Master Roshi's some crazy dude living in the city (at least he still wears a Hawaiian shirt and seems a little perverted), Bulma became Lara Croft and Rambo combined in another body with a bizarre voice, Mai (originally one of Pilaf's hilarious henchmen in the manga) became a cold blooded, shape-shifting killer, Yamcha became a weird cross between a desert bandit who can't fight and a hobo with unwashed hair, and Piccolo became a weird vampire whose outfit seems to be inspired by the Matrix. I think only Grandpa Gohan was close enough to the original character, except for the way he exits the movie early on.\n\nAt some point of the movie, when Goku turns into a gorilla the visual effect was so poorly done that it looks some what like \"Rubber Chicken\". Did they slip in few shots done by stop motion? The face of Gozoru looks like it was done in After Effects, it doesn't look like 3D at all!! First scene of the film, Goku was training with Gohan, the matte painting of the house was so badly done that it looks 2D (cardboard stand) in the background. Blue / Green screen spill was all over, color correction sucks. Visual effect was done much like fresh grad student level. Hollywood have done so much super hero movies in the recent years, and I think the producers just hire the wrong bunch to do such a visual effects intensive film. I believe that Fox knew this film wouldn't go anywhere so they cut budget from hiring the good guys to work on this film!!!\n\nAs far as film-making and story-telling techniques go, you can see cliché after cliché being thrown at you, with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized, and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical know-it-all like in Kung Pu Panda), and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi (Jamie Chung). Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo (an instant shoo-in as one of the worst cinematic villains, ever!) and his temporary sidekick Mai (Eriko Tamura) who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship, in the form of irritating tech-wizard Bulma (Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon), mercenary Yum Cha (Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T) and as I mentioned above Chow Yun-Fat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act likable as Master Roshi, who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku.\n\n If you want to have endless conversation with your friends about how bad this film is, then go watch it. I believe that Hollywood is running out of idea and beginning to tackle Asia stories. But studio got to have more faith in selling these stories with huge fans around the world: Dragonball, Akira and whatnot. If you cut back the budget, it will end up with a disaster like what James Wong did with this movie! Consider Matrix, Wachowski Bros did a total ripe off from a Japanese Animation \"Ghost in the Shell\". Look what they can achieve with the budget they've got. Of course, skills is also a factor and they have better vision than James as well.\n\nI'm being ultra-generous with a 1/10",

So count me surprised at the degree to which I enjoyed Dragonball: Evolution.\n\nRight off the bat, hardcore fans will undoubtedly find things to pick apart with the adaptation, arguing that there's simply no way the movie could match the original anime. And you're right. It doesn't. And, really, what live-action movie ever could? The visual style, pacing, characters and storytelling are so unique to the animated series that any kind of slavish re-interpretation of them would almost certainly fail. This is the very same reason that Speed Racer never fired effectively on all cylinders, despite bravely attempting an inventive new approach. That said, Dragonball: Evolution is perhaps the most successful live-action film to date to utilize costume, production and audio design - not to mention some inspired fight choreography - to provide the flavor of anime without becoming overly cartoonish. It absolutely feels within the spirit of the presentation without attempting to be so overly loyal as to fall flat on its face.\n\nSecondly, this is an origin story and it does a relatively good job of establishing a world and setting up the rules. The story is simple: Goku and his friends - Bulma, Yamacha and Master Roshi - must reunite the seven sacred Dragonballs before the evil Lord Piccolo can collect them and destroy the world. No doubt, the film takes its liberties, and it'll depend entirely upon your level of sensitivity whether you're OK with them. For example, the world in which the movie takes place is much more Westernized - a cross-cultural melting-pot, practically conceived, one imagines, to make the movie more marketable. But the mythology itself, as well as some of the set design and plot elements, never make the film feel too far away from its Eastern roots.\n\n\nClick on the image above to watch our video review for Dragonball: Evolution.\n\nThe problem with most of those movies is simply that nobody takes them seriously. At best, they're cash-cows for videogame tie-in's and product placement, created as an excuse to display some flashy fight choreography and set design, but never sufficiently funded to feel anything other than cheap. Nobody ever pays attention to the story, let alone the level of performance. But with Dragonball, the fan base is simply too large, the phenomenon too massive, to try and sneak by some half-hearted cinematic effort.\n\nAnd aside from the obvious, though certainly not grand, budget, what makes Dragonball at least half-way entertaining is the cast. Justin Chatwin is immensely likeable in this role, and while Goku's journey is absolutely nothing we haven't seen before - save the world, protect your friends and avenge the death of your master - he and the rest of the cast do an admirable job at creating characters the audience can actually care about. Chow Yun-Fat captures the whimsical, half-drunken essence of Roshi and Emmy Rossum, despite being something of a departure from the anime's vision of Bulma, brings a lot of kick-ass chick charisma to the role. None of which would matter at all if the script, written by Ben Ramsey, didn't stop the action and pause the special effects to offer a handful of rather effective character beats. Dragonball isn't just about getting to the next set piece - of which there are plenty - and chooses, instead, to allow its characters moments to be just that... characters. And fortunately, with the exception of Yamacha - who is arguably the least well-drawn - most of the cast rises to the challenge.\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the film is nowhere near perfect. There are a few obvious plot-holes and the occasional eye-rolling, too-convenient coincidence. Lord Piccolo simply isn't given enough to do to make him appear extremely menacing, and his make-up looks as if it had been pulled straight from the storage closet of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\n\nWill people find reasons to hate Dragonball? Absolutely. And will others find reasons to enjoy it? You bet. But we suspect that the younger, less discriminating fans in the audience will like it well enough and that their parents just might, surprisingly, have a good time as well. The older, more set-in-their-ways crowd will undoubtedly pick it apart, but at the very least, we here at IGN think there's something to enjoy, if not necessarily love, about Dragonball: Evolution thats why i give it a 2.5 out of 5.",

It was everything: epic, hilarious, fun, emotional, etc. But the producers of Fox doesn't know that, nor they care. \r\n\r\nDragonball Evolution is probably the second worst adaptation ever (just behind The Last Airbender and how it could not: the dialogue is full of cliches, unfunny jokes, repetitive and dumb, all in really bad acting (except for Chow Yun-Fat)  clumsy editing during the fight scenes and sceneraios that belong more to a rollercoaster; also full of bad Nintendo 64 special effects rip-off. Let's crumble this movie a little bit to examine all the things wrong with this piece of shit:\r\n\r\nThe beginning includes a backstory about King Piccolo and how he tried to destroy the earth. At this far, it seems to follow the original Dragon Ball. However, it goes off-track quickly after that: Piccolo has a beast called Ozaru that serves him. Some magicians create a spell that encages Piccolo and stops him. With Piccolo defeated, Ozaru dissapears, and peace comes to earth. However, two thousand years on the present, Piccolo escapes and is on to get the 7 Dragonballs and summon the Dragon Shenlong to make his wish of conquer to come true...well that's the first 3 minutes and it already has a lot of fails:\r\nFirst, Ozaru is the transformation that every Saiyan goes through when he is to unleash all hos power, also when the moon is at full. If he's Piccolo's minion here, then that means the Saiyan's doesn't exist here. One prime element of the series eliminated from this \"adaptation\". Second, Piccolo was defeated by Goku in the manga and series, thus creating Piccolo Jr. that would become Goku's rival at first and then one of his most beloved friends. Here, is some damn Magicians. Third, they never explain how Piccolo escapes, and fourth, get use to the legend of the Dragonballs, cause the movie tells it a lot of times through the hour and twenty-minutes, like if we could forget it soon, because sure, we are some fucking idiots.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it's only three minutes in and i already hate this. You can guess how the rest of the movie goes. The rest is bad fighting, exposition, bad acting, bad special effects, bad jokes, stupid dialogue, stupid characters, dumb decisions, and other things. Just to quickly explain why this is a really awful adaptation, here's a list:\r\n\r\n-Ozaru is a Piccolo minion.\r\n-Goku is 18 and has none of the attitude of the original (he was innocent and naive, but with an unbeatable spirit).\r\n-Goku is a copy of Peter Parker here: he's constantly being bullied for no reason.\r\n-The bullies are the most stereotypical of all time.\r\n-The Nameks are a destructive race.\r\n-An eclipse is nessessary to awake Ozaru, instead of a full moon.\r\n-The powers of the \"ki\" rips-off the Airbender abillities style.\r\n-The Dragonballs actually talk to Goku.\r\n-Bulma is american. Totally different attitude to the series. She's more like a dumb Bond girl rip-off here, except that she isn't hot.\r\n-Muten Roshi lives in an abandoned house.\r\n-Goku is some kind of \"chosen one\" here.\r\n-Roshi's training metods are nothing like the manga or series.\r\n-Goku actually shows in-love attitudes towards Chi-Chi.\r\n-Yamcha is even more useless than in the series. Plus, he's blonde and has no powers what's so ever.\r\n-Piccolo's blood apparently can create story-undeveloped monsters.\r\n-Goku's staff is never used but to punch a creature...only once.\r\n-The ki blasts from Roshi are Firebender rip-offs.\r\n-Goku doesn't learn to increase his Ki by himself.\r\n-Goku doesn't get to do his famous Kamehameha in his first try.\r\n-Goku and Chi-Chi kisses.\r\n-Turns out the Kamehameha can be used to revive people.\r\n-Goku's outfit barely represents the manga or series' one.\r\n-Goku's hair is spiky, but doesn't help to make him look closer to the original.\r\n-Goku's origin: after Piccolo's defeat, Ozaru somehow transformed into a baby human (Goku) so once he had 18 years, he would become Ozaru and serve Piccolo again...yep.\r\n-Goku kills Roshi.\r\n-Goku defeats Piccolo by using a Kamehameha, something that never happened in the original.\r\n-Shenlong isn't long, and is a very stereotypical chinese Dragon.\r\n-All the movie is wrong overall.\r\n\r\nDragonball Evolution is so bad it's entertaining to say the least. But be aware, it's one of the shittiest movies ever.",

            "content": "Dragonball: Evolution is a slap in the face to my childhood. When I was a kid growing up in the 80's and 90's, Dragonball was the shit. I never read the manga, so I only watched the cartoon. It was fucking epic. The stories and action were amazing. The only complaint I have is the long, drawn-out scenes of people panting and staring. But overall, Dragonball and Dragonball Z are two great shows. This movie doesn't understand Dragonball nor does it attempt to do so.\r\n\r\nIt's directed by James Wong, a no-talent hack who got a film career after a one-hit wonder. The original script for this film was written by Ben Ramsey, who directed the underrated Michael Jai White action film Blood and Bone. Ramsey's script was too expensive to shoot, so 20th Century Fuckface had him write several more drafts under studio notes. Wong came along and provided uncredited re-writes and polishes to the script, again under studio notes. So we can blame Wong for fucking up the Dragonball saga.\r\n\r\nWe begin with a narration that tells us that long ago, the moon eclipsed (too late for a Heroes reference?) as the evil Lord Piccolo, played by James Marsters (the only good actor in this film), and his minion Ozaru, a shitty CGI abomination, brought darkness to our, and I quote, \"peaceful\" planet. We then meet Goku, played by Jimmy from Shameless a.k.a. that dickcheese from Baby Geniuses 2.\r\n\r\nIn the cartoon, he's a member of an alien race known as Saiyans, who appear human except they have tails and know nothing about race or gender. In this movie, Goku is a nerd who is a human and has no tail, and the Saiyans aren't even mentioned. This kid's about as much Goku as Nick Stahl is John Connor. He's too old to be young Goku, he's too young to be old Goku, and his hair makes him look like a Twilight reject. We must be in for one hell of a ride. Also, they also changed the origins and setting of Dragonball, even those of the dragonballs themselves. Yyyyyyyup, this is gonna hurt like hell.\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, Goku's 18th birthday is today and his grandpa Gohan gives him one of the seven magical dragonballs as a present. Goku goes to school and gets picked on by local bully Carey Fuller, played by that douchenozzle from Final Destination 3. Goku has a crush on Chi Chi, played by one of the girls from Sucker Punch (a much better film than this one). In the cartoon, Goku wasn't trying to impress Chi Chi. It was vice-versa. But let's face it, if I point out any more differences between the cartoon and this movie, we're gonna be here 25/8, people.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, Goku goes to Chi Chi's party and even manages to get past the bullies. On that night, however, Lord Piccolo (a.k.a. an alien with a Matrix suit who looks like Yoshi and a head of lettuce) and his big-boobed minion kill his grandpa and fail to get a Dragonball. So Goku runs to his destroyed home and finds his grandpa dead in a scene lifted directly from Star Wars. Most of this film's material rips off several other films, like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and The Matrix. Hell, in one scene, they even rip off Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. I don't even kid you when I say that. This film makes Skyline look like Raiders of the Lost Ark by comparison. In fact, whenever Goku touches a Dragonball, there's always this weird vision bullshit that rips off LOTR and in one of them, we get an image stolen directly from Armageddon, a Michael Bay movie. God, talk about a new low in filmmaking.\r\n\r\nJust before grandpa dies, he tells Goku to find Roshi, who has another one of the Dragonballs. The next morning, the house isn't completely destroyed anymore for some unexplained reason, and meets Bulma of the Capsule Corporation. Bulma is played by Emmy Rossum. Yeah, this film actually managed to waste genuine talent. Bulma's hair isn't blue like in the cartoon except for like one highlight in the hair. Bulma's Dragonball was stolen by Piccolo's big-tit Asian minion and teams up with Goku to find the Dragonballs.\r\n\r\nThey find Roshi's Kame-house, which looks absolutely nothing like the original Kame-house (the set designs in Resident Evil (movies & games) were more accurate). They meet Roshi, played by Chow Yun-Fat (more talent wasted in this shit), who reveals to them that he not only knew but also trained Gohan. That makes no sense because Gohan is older than Roshi. Don't even get me started on how Roshi looks absolutely fucking nothing like Roshi. Then, he tells us that the Dragonball attacks turn out to be airbending techniques. The nail. This movie hit it right on the head. Blood oozes out as I fall dead on the floor.\r\n\r\nUnder Roshi's wing, Goku begins training his Ki, knowing that they must get all the Dragonballs before the next solar eclipse, when Ozaru will return and join with Piccolo. In the midst of the group's search for the Dragonballs, they fall into a trap set by desert bandit Yamcha, but Roshi convinces Yamcha to join them. Together, the group fight off an ambush by Mai and successfully get the next Dragonball. As the group continues their quest, they travel to a temple where Roshi consults his former teacher Sifu Norris, played by Ernie Hudson (more talent being wasted) and begins preparing the Mafuba enchantment so he can reseal Piccolo, while Goku must learn the most powerful of the ki-bending techniques: the Kamehameha.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, Mai (disguised as Chi-Chi) steals the team's Dragonballs, adding them to the ones that Piccolo already has. Mai and the real Chi Chi even get a fight which leads to Goku getting killed but being brought back to life with the Kamehameha (the writers were too lazy to use the Senzu Beans). With the Dragonballs successfully united, Piccolo begins to summon Shen Long, but is stopped by the timely arrival of Goku's team. During the ensuing battle, Piccolo reveals to Goku that Goku himself is Ozaru, having been sent to Earth as an infant to destroy it when he came of age. As the eclipse begins, Goku transforms into Ozaru while Roshi attempts to use the Mafuba, but he doesn't have enough energy to live before he can reseal Piccolo. Roshi's dying words restore Goku to his senses as he is choked to death by Ozaru.\r\n\r\nHe engages Piccolo in a final battle, seemingly defeating him with the power of the Kamehameha. Goku then uses the Dragonballs to summon Shen Long, and request that he restore Roshi to life. As they celebrate, they realize the Dragonballs have now scattered, and Bulma declares that they must seek the balls again in the sequel that will never enter development. Before they head out, Goku meets with Chi Chi to get to know her better, and they begin a sparring match to see which of them is stronger. This film is so bad even Krillin got \"owned\" out of the movie (not my joke).\r\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 1/10\r\n\r\nAn atrocious adaptation of a wonderful franchise and a terrible film in general. Character development, good dialogue, good performances, entertaining action, good effects, a good story, and a plot that makes sense are sorely absent from this shit-pile. This film has an IQ of 4 with abysmal writing, horrendous direction, miscast actors, and special effects and CGI that look like they were done with After Effects. The effects in The Mummy 3 were better than this fucking garbage.",
