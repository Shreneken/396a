The film's whimsical and surrealist style, coupled with Wes Anderson's precise directorial touch, creates a truly unique viewing experience. The voice cast, led by George Clooney as the titular character, delivers some of the most memorable and hilarious performances in recent memory. The characters are all lovable, each with their own quirks and personalities that bring the story to life. The film's score, composed by Alexandre Desplat, perfectly captures the film's adventurous spirit. The attention to detail in the animation is astounding, with every frame bursting with texture and color. The pacing of the film is also perfect, with a narrative that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a true cinematic gem and a must-watch for all ages.",

After promising Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) that he will no longer steal poultry from the henhouse, Mr. Fox (George Clooney) is unable to resist his animal instincts and eventually finds himself in a life and death battle with three farmers, all of whom are committed to ending the thefts.  The stop action animation is absolutely stunning throughout, filled with minute detail from start to finish.  Cleverly written and ably performed by a cast of Anderson regulars (Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, etc.), it really is an animated film like no other, filled with clever humor and interesting set pieces, all economically crammed into a tight eighty-seven minute running time.",

Mrs. Fox is very interesting, her character arc is amazing, she loves to paint and her painting is fabulous. Her voice is very suitable for her character and her character is over all lovely.",

The opening piece of stop motion didn't actually fill me with confidence, but thankfully that immediately disappeared as the whole thing looks truly excellent.\n\nGeorge Clooney is great in this, definitely the most I've liked a performance (from what I've currently seen, of course) of his away from the 'Ocean's flicks.

Lacking the dark edge of Dahl's book and of his writing in general, Fantastic Mr Fox is not so good as an adaptation, however on its own terms it is wonderful. It is an endearing and hugely enjoyable film.\n\nOne thing that stood out was how the film looked. Instead of the CGI rendered effects, Wes Anderson opts for a more old-fashioned stop-motion effect. This decision worked, because the visual look is outstanding, not just in the beautifully detailed backgrounds and sets but in how the characters move as well and the small details such as the armchair in his writing hut.\n\nI like Alexandre Desplat's music quite a bit. His score for Fantastic Mr Fox is no exception, it is quirky yet still has the minimalist style that makes Desplat stand out. The story is sometimes slow in the pace but because of the humour and how it looked, I never found the film boring, besides the story itself is so good. The writing is great, the humour is more adult but a vast majority of it is very funny with the odd touching moment too.\n\nThe characters add a lot. Mr Fox is one of my favourite titular characters in a book and the film did little to change that, and while some are slightly underused they serve their purpose well. The voice work is fantastic. I wasn't sure about George Clooney, but he does do a bravura job, and Meryl Streep is quite touching. Michael Gambon is sterling, as is Bill Murray as Badger.\n\nIn conclusion, hugely enjoyable and one of my personal favourites of 2009. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Reminiscing back on this fantastic experience back, I have to admit that I may have approached this movie with hopes a little bit too high. For example, when Mr. Fox was buying a new home, he encountered a strange badger that seemed to blank out in the oddest of ways, which was sort of unsettling. Not only this, but Mr. Fox has continuously made use of strange terms such as \"You cussin' with me?\" or that peevish snap and a whistle (which is apparently his \"signature move\" or supposed \"trademark\"). However, I have to give the movies huge props for extending the plot, since in the story they left the reader hanging worrying about how long the hunters waited for the animals to come out. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends because there are tremendously quirky aspects of this film that normal people - if anybody - will ever understand first hand. Maybe I'm just not brilliant enough in the liberal arts to process what the film directors were thinking when they made Mr. Fox, but maybe I'm not the only one that would think this way.",

            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox: A Work of Art.\nThis week I watched the highly enjoyable film, Fantastic Mr. Fox. Directed by Wes Anderson and adapted by him from the book by Roald Dahl, it also stars George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray. The film tells the story of Mr. Fox and his family and their attempt to evade the farmers Boggin, Bunce, and Bean who seek to kill Mr. Fox for stealing their crops. The thing that struck me most about this film and the thing I was fully expecting to strike me going in was the immense amount of color and craft that went into the visuals of this film. This Movie is truly a work of art in every sense of the word. Every scene is packed full of insane detail and color all of which is handcrafted in every respect. It's almost off putting at the beginning the unique and original style that the film presents. The film opens on a signature Wes Anderson symmetrical wide shot that, while having ample dead space, features a single tree at the center that sits atop a round hill where Mr. Fox is standing and eating an apple in the orange light of sunset. The quick jerky movements of his character display for all to see that this film is animated with stop motion. Each character handmade and moved frame by frame on a miniature set to display the action. All throughout the film we move from one gorgeous set to another and with Anderson's unique style of cinematography catch the action in a fun and artistic way that is not hindered by the constraints that stop motion usually present. The colors and characters provide a life to the film that is all its own. The thing that can be said most about this film is the way it really does stand apart if only for the incredibly unique and beautiful way it tells its equally unique story. There is, however, more to the film than that. Even though the movie is like looking at a masterpiece in multiple arts at the same time for eighty minutes and even though it's made for children and is lighthearted and comical, the film does have substance under the show that shines from behind the visuals and makes them all the more radiant. Simply a joy to look at and full of humor and family values, Fantastic Mr. Fox is not just an example of how kid's movies should be made, but is a gold standard of how great films can be made.\nThe thing that really stands out about Fantastic Mr. Fox is its chaotic and colorful world that only Wes Anderson could provide. My mind was blown away by the amount of movement and detail in every frame of the film and especially in the long tracking shots and many other unique angles that it explores. Stop motion animation is not an easy thing to pull off in general but it seems that Anderson was born for it. Even in his live action films the action on screen is very deliberate and explosive; with each movement and line of dialogue carefully timed to create the right flow in the scene. In the stop motion medium, Anderson is able to use this style to the full and in typical fashion completely sells the odd nature of the film we are watching. He also takes the opportunity to saturate Mr Fox's world with rich colors and intricate design and artistry. Not a single frame is boring to look at and each one is a work of art in its own right. The opening shot (as I mentioned before) the apple cellar and the sewer waterfall are all excellent examples of how much craftsmanship and care was put into making these tiny models and sets really come to life. As if the match between Wes and stop motion wasn't clear enough, even his signature style of Cinematography blends perfectly with the medium. With long symmetrical wide shots and perfectly horizontal tracking shots, Anderson's style lets the animation really speak for itself with frames full of color, action and artistry while still lending an attitude of quirkiness to the camerawork that every other aspect of the film has in droves. Unlike many pioneering films, Fantastic Mr Fox is not hindered by the massive amount of work and innovation that went into its creation but embraces its style, with all its pros and cons, to the full and thus creates an experience that works on all levels.\nAs for theme, I think I need to say before anything else that this movie is just plain ridiculous. Everything it says or tries to say is done tongue and cheek or with a punchline. As lite family entertainment it doesn't really push a message to the forefront (the closest it gets is the subplot about Ash being \"different\" and how that's ok) but like all good stories, it does present some interesting Ideas that can and should be considered. At the center of the story is Mr Fox (obviously) who finds himself going up against his own primal instincts. At the very start of the film, Mr and Mrs Fox stage a heist together and they get caught. When Mrs Fox rather casually reveals that she is pregnant and requests that he find a \"new line of work\" the film cuts to two years later where Mr Fox lives peacefully with his wife and son in an underground house and is now a columnist for a newspaper. He expresses a wish to live again to his wife and mentions that he wants to buy a house above ground since he won't have much more time to live. This is the first in a series of \"rebellions\" that Mr Fox stages in order to relive the days before he became domesticated. All goes well at first and he robs the first two farmers with no issue and he keeps telling his partner Kylie that he'll stop after the next robbery. However the second robbery causes the three farmers, Boggin, Bunce and Bean to lie in wait for Mr Fox and they spring on him while he re-enters his house. Mr Fox escapes minus a tale but the farmers resolve to dig him out and kill him once and for all. This causes the entire animal community to go underground into the sewers to hide. Mr Fox must learn to do what he should rather than what he wants to do. Even though it seemed to be paying off to go back into a life of stealing (the animal community even resorts to stealing after going underground) it causes much danger and inconvenience for all those around Mr Fox. Mr Fox never really does learn his lesson about stealing (the film ends with him and his family robbing a grocery store) what he does learn is that reliving the past is not worth jeopardizing what one has in the present. In a way, Mr Fox must go against his primal instinct to be wild and wandering to live a life of domestication in order to protect his family. It parallels, in its own unique way, a mid-life crisis story (one can make comparisons between Mr Fox and Mr Incredible in the Incredibles for instance) but though that is the core conflict of the film, the truth of the matter is that the movie is there to have a good time and man does it deliver.\nFor the protagonist and antagonists of the story, their actions are based intrinsically on their wants. Mr Fox wants to feel alive again after 12 fox years of calm domesticity and it's only after an all out war with Borgin, Bunce and Bean that he realises his mistakes and comes around to being devoted to those around him instead of thinking of himself. As a polar opposite are the three antagonists: Borgin, Bunce and Bean who start out similarly motivated by their wants but their want is to kill Mr Fox for good so he can no longer steal their crops. Again with a tongue in cheek attitude the film depicts their relentless battle against Mr Fox which includes digging a giant hole where his house stood, laying siege to that hole and literally holding his nephew Kristofferson hostage. Even though their actions are over the top ruthless they still display what a juggernaut desire can be and how dangerous it can get. When someone is willing to do anything to get what they want then they are in a rather dangerous position in life that might cause them to do terrible things. In between this central conflict are Mrs Fox and Ash. Mrs Fox, more than her husband initially, provides the noble want that stands in contrast to the three farmers. She does everything she can to provide for the well being of her family and provides a moral compass for Mr Fox. He knows he isn't following this compass when he performs his first robbery and thus hides the fact from his wife until the secret finally comes out. When it does, Mrs Fox provides for her husband the questions of introspection that ultimately bring him to the right and final course. Ash is the moody and reclusive son of the Foxes. Dubbed as \"different\" in the very first scene with him, at first he seems like he just wants to be left alone, especially when his \"perfect\" cousin Kristofferson comes to stay. As we get to know the character better however, it becomes clear that he doesn't want to be different. He wants to be as good as his father and his cousin in whack bat, he wants to join his father on his heists and he doesn't want to be little. His Mother and his Father explain to him near the end that there is nothing wrong with being different, it doesn't make him worse than everyone else and being unique is a strength not a weakness. Ash even gets his own little payoff when his being little helps him to save his cousin from captivity. Bolstered by a strong cast and masterful character animation, this is a film with a real core and compelling, if not oddly quirky, characters.\nFantastic Mr Fox is good clean fun but also a dazzling work of art. These two elements, so rarely coupled together, put it at masterpiece status. It is a masterclass in the art of stop motion, with each element meticulously handcrafted to create a film incredibly unique and simply a joy to drink in. Colorful, snappy and even stylish, tiny details and brilliant composition abound throughout the film. As a kids movie, the messages or deeper meanings are not in focus but that makes them all the more poignant when discovered and discussed. Not quite an allegory while still not being quite applicable in subject matter to real life, it exists primarily as a fairy tale and plays the part masterfully. The characters are larger than life and delightful, filling up each frame with vivacity and life. The diverse and colorful voice cast complete the picture by adding a special kind of animation all of their own that is so pivotal to stop motion. Fantastic Mr Fox is art. Somewhat high art admittedly but it is so full of charm and life that anyone, even a child, can connect with it and all ages and people can appreciate its appeal. It is truly timeless and a masterpiece that all can enjoy.",

I watched it in the movie theatre when it initially came out, however, honestly, I didn't remember any of it. So, I finally rented it and put it on, and what a ride. The movie is really fun, I've never read the Roald Dahl novel, but that really didn't bother me. Being a children's movie, the plot was whimsical and fun, but it also had some very prominent adult themes. Being a fox in a world straight out of a fairy tale, but also being able to add in the element of a mundane average life being flipped on its head is really what this film is. Being Wes Anderson's first animated feature, it's easy to see how he translates his typical visual style into the animated medium. The voice acting is great and the plot makes for a fun take on the heist format. Still, somehow, all of that doesn't help the movie from some of my big problems with it. Although the plot is fun, I felt that some of the emotional beats didn't work, I have noticed that this has somehow become one of my largest problems with Wes Anderson't movies. Some of the character arcs didn't come to the right conclusion either, and being a fan of strong characters, this did annoy me, as the characters were great at the beginning. But cuss it, the movie was a lot of fun, and I'm really glad I watched it. 8.7/10",

The same is said for the villainous humans who, in proper Wes Anderson form, are just people trying to live their lives and dealing with a desk who is harming their industries.

            "content": "\"Fantastic Mr. Fox,\" is a great piece of stop-motion animation by Wes Anderson. Anderson is known for having a unique flare in filmmaking with his bright colors, witty dialogue, and memorable characters. This entry in his filmography is no different. Based on the book by Roald Dahl, the movie captures much of the charm from Dahl's writing. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, and Jason Shwartzman lead a great voice cast that enhance their characters with their ability to deliver their lines so well. The dialogue is charming and hilarious. The choice to replace every curse word with \"cuss\" made for some funny moments and is one of the more memorable things in this movie. The story is about a fox who gets into trouble by deciding to fall back on old habits. This movie is fun and the plot moves along nicely. There is really never a dull moment in this picture. The pacing is great and everything seems to have a pay-off by the end of the movie. Mr. Fox's son, Ash, might have the most change as he comes to accept himself as he is, but also that he can still do athletic things even if they aren't as great as his father or cousin. His change is what I thought was most impactful. It is a bit of a downer that the main character, Mr. Fox, isn't overly fantastic or interesting though. All he does is cause trouble and really doesn't see any consequences to his actions that are permanent (other than tail loss). The animation, done by stop-motion, is great. I'm not sure how many images there are in this movie, but there has to be an insane amount because every little movement in the characters or scenery is an image and there is a lot of motion throughout the movie. This movie is a fun one to watch. This movie is very good, but it does fall a bit short of fantastic. Overall, I give this movie an 8/10.",

            "content": "Ocean's Eleven meets The Secret of NIMH.\n\nWes Anderson's stop motion animated comedy film Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) is a joyful family feature for everyone. Wes plays off of the Western and heist genres. The whistles and snaps in Alexandre Desplat's score are straight out of Western music with the empty street encounter showdowns as well. Anderson takes Roald Dahl's delight's children's book and brings it to life with resplendent claymation and adorable optimism. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a story about love of family and achieving your potential. I think any child could learn about working together and communicating your feelings better like Mr. Fox. It's a wonderful kids movie and a fine piece of filmmaking from Wes.\n\nWes Anderson's direction is stellar with fast pacing and silly humor for this pleasant 87 minute picture. Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach's script is full of clever references and criticisms of capitalist farmers with no regard for the animal life surrounding them. I love how the animals talk. They're personified, so that viewers can relate to their family drama regardless of their furry state of being. Tristan Oliver's cinematography matches Anderson's early symmetrical framing and with plenty of fun wide shots. I like the brave close-up shots that showcase how detailed the puppets are in fur and eye realism. Their expressions are lifelike to people. I really have to hand it to Wes' animation team. They crafted one of the greatest animated features ever.\n\nGeorge Clooney is brilliant as the sly Mr. Fox. His sense of humor and good nature come across his splendid voice work as the lead wild animal in Wes Anderson's magical little comedy. Clooney plays Mr. Fox as completely cool and calculating like he's Danny Ocean with fur. Meryl Streep is phenomenal as Felicity Fox with her stern mood, rising temper, and tender affection as Mr. Fox's beloved wife. Jason Schwartzman is fun as the moody and jealous Ash Fox. Bill Murray is excellent as the scolding Clive Badger. Willem Dafoe is strange and threatening as the complex Rat. \n\nFurthermore, I like the relaxed Owen Wilson as the passive aggressive Coach Skip. Wallace Wolodarsky as the shy and steadfast opossum. Eric Chase Anderson is excellent as the skillful natural Kristofferson Silverfox. Michael Gambon is fearsome as the cruel farmer Franklin Bean. Wes Anderson himself is fun as the real estate agent Stan Weasel. Juman Malouf, Wes' wife, is sweet as the quiet Agnus the fox. Roman Coppola is the squirrel contractor and Brian Cox cameos as the reporter's voice. Who else could you want? How about Adrien Brody as an adorable field mouse?",

Behind the camera, Wes Anderson makes one of the best adaptations of a Roal Dahl book to date, thanks to innovative stop motion animation and witty script, that expands on the original children's story while staying true to its spirit (the rest of the animal characters are nicely fleshed out, with Bill Murray of course stepping in as Fox's badge lawyer).

Although it appears the target audience is children in my opinion it is better suited for adults. Don't worry, there is nothing in this movie that is inappropriate for kids but, if you are looking for a typical Disney movie for family time this might not be the best choice. With a realistic animation style and a washed-out color scheme you might find it difficult to maintain a child's attention. But if you are an adult looking for a fun movie to watch I think you have found your film. As mentioned before the setting of the film and the characters are different than the soft featured animation done by DreamWorks or Pixar. The almost realistic look of the animals in the film might be a little too much for a small child to handle. This paired with a dull and desolate setting might prove to be boring for some children. Aside from the visual side of the film some of the topics in the movie are more relatable to adults. Examples are things such as Mr. Fox having a financial and legal advisor that is addressed several times throughout the film and several instances of inebriation. This movie addresses several big topics as well such as deforestation, unplanned pregnancies, and possible LGBTQ+ issues depending on the viewers interpretation. Lastly the over all theme of the movie is about Mr. Fox and his need to live among the elite which ultimately leads to the destruction of his family and the relapse of a kleptomaniac lifestyle.",

The film stars George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Jason Schwartzman as Ash.\n\nThe voice acting in my opinion is really strong. I personally don't very much like George Clooney, but I have to say that he does one of his best performances yet as the fantastic Mr. Fox.\n\nThe characters like the voice acting are also really strong and memorable. I also personally really like the villains Boggis, Bunce, Bean and Rat.\n\nThe cinematography like most of Wes Anderson's films is very good with some really nice shots of the characters and scenery.\n\nThe animation in my opinion is great and really vibrant. The animation also works incredibly well with the style of the film.\n\nThe film also has some very sound and beautifully designed settings from a tree house to various farms.\n\nLike most of Wes Anderson's films the style is exemplary from the colour scheme to the character design. \n\nThe film also has some very sound and violent action especially for a children's film.\n\nThe dialogue in my opinion like most of Wes Anderson's films is delivered really well with great timing.\n\nThe music is also really strong and fits with the film extremely well.\n\nThe story though changed from the original story by Roald Dahl is still very strong and enjoyable to watch fold out.\n\nWes Anderson in my opinion has a great way with comedy and it shows here. From the jokes to the timing the comedy is pulled off near perfectly.\n\nThe film at points also has some really good atmosphere.\n\nThe film I also think is incredibly enjoyable and something I could watch everyday and never get bored with.\n\nOver all I think this film is a masterpiece. Over all I give it a\n10/10\n100%\n5/5\n\nAs perfect as a film can get",

It gives hope to the future of stop-motion and will hold up forever.

Everything is stop motion, from the smoke to the water; you would never notice. It is all of the small details that happen simultaneously that make it feel so real. The cast brings so much emotion to the characters and George Clooney and Meryl Streep do a beautiful job playing a fox that is both civilized and (wait for it) a wild animal.\n\nThe chapter names as well are a nice reference back to the book.",

The characters are funny and the voice acting was really good, making the clay animals come to life with passion and finesse.

The animation isn't incredible, but I still love the style, and wish more studios made films this way. My favorite parts of this movie, however, are the characters; I love them all, and they all feel like real people (personally, I like Ash and Kristofferson the most).\nOverall, this movie is fantastic, and is great to watch if you're a 24 year-old looking for lighthearted movies to watch yourself, or if you're a parent looking for a good family movie.",

The work went behind the stop-motion animation is just marvelous especially to pull it off on such large scale and to speculate it with such nuance that it leaves the audience in an awe of it. \n\nThe acts distributed in here and the way they shift from one to another is bizarrely ingenious and extremely powerful. It is eerily fast paced yet aptly cooked characters that offers enough depth for the viewers to dig in and explore. \n\nThe writing is sharp, to- the-point and explicit with tiny tactics installed in here that not only is infomercial but hilarious too. Such dysfunctional family might have been familiar to the audience but with a perspective like this, the clock starts from zero. \n\nIt is rich on technical aspects like its up beating background score, amazing songs, metaphorical cinematography and fine editing that paints the picture brighter. The voice cast fills in perfectly in this wild world and has done a hilarious work especially by Clooney, Streep, Murray and Wilson. \n\nAnderson's strong script matches its brilliant execution where you know that you have surrendered to his surreal world when he draws out emotions from these characters and pours it like rain over the audience. The three dimensional characters, satirical humor, moral conflicts and thought provoking policy that is genuinely effective are the high points of the feature. \n\nFantastic Mr. Fox is a forced to be reckoned with, that not only shows potential in such animation but also the structure of the script.",

With most of the books I read at home back when I was in seventh grade as you Americans call it being written by the late Roald Dahl otherwise known by Screen Junkies as \"Creepy Dr. Seuss\", I wanted to see the film adaptation of the book. Back then, all I saw was a decent comedy that ended far too quickly and managed to extend its source material to great new heights without succumbing to what I like to call \"The Dr. Seuss Movie Curse\". Now that I've grown up a bit I notice it has a more adult-oriented apporach with still enough charm to appeal to children. This movie and Coraline were actually refreshing movies to watch in 2009 since we got to take a break from CGI for a while. There were actually some really great shots thanks to the fewer limitations of animation. It sometimes even feels like a 2D side-scrolling video game. The movie's funny with slapstick jokes such as Mr. Fox and his opossum friend to dialogue-based jokes an example of which is Bill Murray's description of the three bad guy farmers and Advertised Extra Owen Wilson describing a fictional sport with complicated rules. And George Clooney nails it as Mr. Fox. He really does, I'm not saying that just to be polite or anything. Since this is my first Wes Anderson movie, I can't praise his sense of humour as heavily as in his other movies. So, if I were to write a definition for this movie in Urban Dictionary, what would I say? Fantastic Mr. Fox: A stop-motion movie released in 2009 that no one saw because...it's not CGI, I guess? Which is a shame because the movie's hilarious with a clever plot, witty humour and great voice-acting with George Clooney doing a great job at delivering a \"click-click\" noise that serves as the Fox's trademark. If you haven't watched it, go see it now. And I have severe doubts that reading the book will make you say \"THIS MOVIE FREAKIN' SUCKS!!!\" after watching the movie for a second time. Satisfaction guaranteed.",

When I was at the city library, trying to copy something, I realize that I should rent some movies that I wouldn't be able to watch on TV unless it's actually now playing them. So I got myself some Sofia Coppola films and some Christian films as I heard they are terrible, and I wanted to torture myself for fun. Then I tried to think of another film to watch, and once I was thinking of my best friend, I knew that I wanted to rent this movie as this is one of her favorites, and I haven't seen this in a long time. So of course I watched this first, and I find this a lot of fun to watch. The voice acting is fantastic in this, which is kind of funny to see George Clooney and Bill Murray's characters go at each other by just growling at them. The animation is amazing that even the big things that it does in this film look so simple and easy, which I know that the animators worked very hard on it, and the effects show in this. The characters are very enjoyable to watch, especially Kylie who's played by Wallace Wolodarsky, which I didn't know he was an actor as he's a writer in some of the early Simpsons episodes, and wrote the third Wimpy Kid movie, and he plays the main character's accomplice which he sometimes just stand there dazing and not paying attention, which always makes me laugh for some reason. The script by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach is very witty and hilarious that I was enjoying almost every second of this film, and it didn't felt quirky for the sake of being quirky and nothing else. Fantastic Mr. Fox is an excellent film that is probably one of my favorite stop-motion animated films.",

I can't count the number of times someone just tells you exactly what they are doing or are planning to do. And whenever something out of the ordinary occurs there is rarely a reaction, everyone behaves as if every moment is exactly what they expected. The one good thing about this style is that it prepared me so that I wasn't in the least bit surprised when the humans and animals just started communicating with each other as if they all spoke the same language. \n\nThere were some humorous moments in Fantastic Mr. Fox that did work for me. I laughed occasionally at the physical humor and some of the running gags. I should also give a lot of credit to the skill that I know it took to make the stop-motion animation work. I've never been the biggest fan of how stop motion looks, and this is probably my least favorite ever. The fur on the animals looked scratchy like everything is made out of straw. I'd rather look at old Rankin/Bass Christmas specials than this stuff. Still I recognize the art that goes into this style of film. It takes so much talent and patience, so I feel like a jerk for not loving it. \n\nThe story of Fantastic Mr. Fox worked better for me than Wes Anderson's typical movie. It seemed a little more clear cut and there were actual motivations for all the characters that made sense. I just wish I liked the characters more. I mean, Mr. Fox might be on my list of least sympathetic protagonists ever. I don't think there's a single thing he does in this movie that redeems him for me. They certainly try to make us forgive him, but it never worked for me. Then his son, Ash, is a jealous bully. That also makes me want to scream. So, a strong story with some effective humor, but with unlikable main characters and odd style. I'd say Fantastic Mr. Fox is definitely not a film for me.",

An animated film done by a live-action director serves to showcase how style can become a gimmick. While Woody Allen didn't direct Antz, it was still a Woody Allen film, and it was harder to watch than the vastly superior A Bug's Life. As far as Fantastic Mr. Fox is concerned, it's ok to sit through once, but I don't think kids or adults (unless they're Wes Anderson fanatics) will sit for repeat viewings.",

The cast of voice acting talent is a great ensemble of a lot of Anderson's regulars that act as well live together as they do animated.  As for the animation, it's stop action style comes off as something new and the fast  pace of makes the story and characters come alive.  Definitely still retains the feel that past and future Anderson projects yield with a whimsical finish that makes it all it's own.",

Nevertheless, as a wild animal, Mr. Fox cannot reconciled to the quiet life which Ms. Fox urges him to hew to, he purchases a new tree house regardless of his lawyer Mr. Badger (Murray)\u0092s persuasion because three meanest human farmers are living nearby. Later Mr. Fox\u0092s teenage nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) comes to stay with them, whose athletic bent walks away with Mr. Fox\u0092s commendation and leaves a gauche Ash pale in comparison.  \n\ncontinue reading my review on my blog: http://wp.me/p1eXom-1XX",

However Anderson does a wonderful job of introducing you to the world and his characters that make you feel like their is history and genuine relationships between them. However, the issue with this, is that the beginning of the film brings much more comedy and the latter half of the film is much more serious, and not as interesting. While the latter half is still great, it drags on a bit more after multiple viewings. This is only because Anderson has established his world so much. It almost makes you want to forego the plot just so you can sit and enjoy his world, without changes made to it, just a bit longer. Almost everything about this film clicks so well even mixing of the audiences, whether you viewed it as an adult or a child, was done almost flawlessly. The themes represented, including: self acceptance, ego management, and mid life crisis, means that people of all ages can find a reason to love and attach themselves to this film.  If you haven't seen it yet. Do yourself a favor and go see it now.",

Felicity reveals to Fox that she is pregnant and pleads with him to find a safer job when they escape.\n\nTwo years later (twelve in Fox Years), the Foxes and their sullen son Ash are living in a hole. Fox, now a newspaper columnist, moves the family into a better home in the base of a tree, ignoring the warnings of his lawyer Badger about how dangerous the area is for foxes. The tree is located very close to facilities run by three mean farmers consisting of Walter Boggis, Nathaniel Bunce, and Franklin Bean. Soon after the Foxes move in, Felicity's nephew Kristofferson Silverfox comes to live with them as his father has become very ill with double pneumonia. Ash finds this situation intolerable; his soft-spoken cousin is apparently superior to him at almost everything, and everyone, including his father, Mr. Fox, is charmed by Kristofferson at Ash's expense.\n\nFox and Kylie Opossum steal produce and poultry from the three farms. The farmers decide to kill Fox and camp out near the family's tree. When Fox emerges, the farmers open fire, but manage only to shoot off his tail. They then attempt to dig Fox out. After demolishing the site of the tree, the farmers discover the Foxes have dug an escape tunnel.\n\nReasoning that the Foxes will have to surface for food and water, the farmers lie in wait at the tunnel mouth. Underground, Fox encounters Badger and many other local animal residents whose homes have also been destroyed. As the animals begin fearing starvation, Fox leads Clive Badger, Mole, Beaver, and Weasel in a digging expedition to tunnel to the three farms, robbing them clean. While the other animals feast, Ash and Kristofferson, beginning to reconcile after Kristofferson defended Ash from Mr. Beaver's son, return to Bean's farm, intending to reclaim Mr. Fox's tail. When they are interrupted by the arrival of Bean's wife, Ash escapes but Kristofferson is captured.\n\nDiscovering that Fox has stolen their produce, the farmers flood the animals' tunnel network with cider. The animals are forced into the sewers and Fox learns that the farmers plan to use Kristofferson to lure him into an ambush. The animals are confronted by Rat, Bean's security guard. Fox and Rat fight in an electrical room until Fox pushes him into an electric generator, severely electrocuting him. Rat confesses Kristofferson's location before his death.\n\nFox asks the farmers for a meeting in town near the sewer hub where he would surrender in exchange for Kristofferson's freedom. The farmers set up an ambush, but Fox and the others anticipate it and launch a counterattack. Fox, Ash and Kylie slip into Bean's farm. A much-matured Ash frees Kristofferson and braves enemy fire to release a rabid beagle named Spitz to keep the farmers at bay.\n\nThe animals become accustomed to living in the sewers with others considering moving in. Ash and Kristofferson settle their differences and become good friends. Fox leads his family to a drain opening built into the floor of a supermarket owned by the three farmers. Celebrating their new food source and the news that Felicity is pregnant again, the animals dance in their aisles.",

This film is everything a Dahl film should be. Its deliriously funny, completely incomprehensible and astoundingly crafted. Wes Anderson, I say this to you now, this is not only an achievement in stop motion but an animated masterpiece. And who the hell on God's green earth cant love the fabulous voices of George Clooney and Meryl Streep? The screenplay is tender, charming, witty and first and foremost enjoyably sensational. Not since The Nightmare Before Christmas (excluding claymation) has stop motion been so splendid. It seems, like James and the Giant Peach, Dahl's books are best for stop motion. This is competing against Up for best animated picture at the oscars and I know I gave it the same rating, but this is simply that little bit better and more nuanced. Anyone who says that animation cant live up to the standards of live-action is bloody kidding themselves. And this film prooves that in spades",

Disney films, with only some as an exception, have taken familiar a formula to drive almost all of their films with only a minor set of tweaks, hoping it would be enough to create a sense of originality. In the hand-drawn animation department, Studio Ghibli is winning the battle with their bold and graceful artistic choices, fuelled by a sense of imagination and hidden symbolism. Pixar has established themselves as the leaders of three-dimensional computer graphic animations to create wonderful stories that deliver multi-generational accessibility and richly appealing characters and worlds. Fantastic Mr. Fox belongs in the underrated category of stop-animation films, which is an area of animated filmmaking that rarely gains a large audience, as some feel it lacks the realism and wonder that other modes of animation could deliver, and the difficult process of creating such a feature does not entirely justify the benefits of the finished product.\n\nI believe that animation should not be limited by its two popular options. There are gems found in a stop-motion animated film that easily becomes lost when told in another medium. If Fantastic Mr. Fox was told through hand-drawn animation then all of its three-dimensional charm is lost, creating flat characters and a world lacking in complexity. Using three-dimensional computer graphics could achieve that extra dimensions that the hand-drawn animations lack, but they tend to give that smooth texture that keeps the film from seeming life-like, also the comedic aspect of the film wouldn't have been achieved as effectively if told in this way. Stop-motion animation may not be the most deliver the smoothest of movement from its characters, but it doesn't have to because what we are seeing are actual living objects that are interacting with one another, which is hard to convey with the other two options.\n\nThe film was under the direction of visual director, Wes Anderson, and what he brings to this is a sense of style that is certainly familiar to the fans that have been long following his work, but it also brings something entirely different and unique to the realm of stop-motion animation; the film is leaps and bounds beyond Chicken Little and the Wallace and Gromit films. Anderson's visual and artistic trademarks are here and they are on full display, giving the characters and their world a sense of strangeness and eccentricity, gaining a sense of escape during the experience; but since Anderson is handling fictional characters rather than human projections, their personalities do not seem as odd or intense as his previous films. It actually allows it to become easier for a person, who is unfamiliar with the director, to come into this and still feel like they just experienced another run-of-the-mill animated film; and Anderson knew his target audience and what their expectations were. If he decided to crank up his usual style to maximum, just so the film would really stand out from its peers, then it\u00e2??s going to have people turn their heads and probably lose the natural charm that made the film so appealing.\n\nI cannot note in this review whether the film remained true to Roald Dahl's novel, as I have yet to read it; therefore do not expect any comparisons here, and everything I would state or judge on the film's story would be purely based on the film itself. Wes Anderson returns as the film's screenwriter, collaborating once again with his friend Noah Baumbach to create Fantastic Mr. Fox. I was a little sceptical on whether or not I would find myself pleased with the film, as when they both worked together previously on The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, I was left disappointed and so far I have regarded it as Anderson's weakest film. After watching this, I was a little stunned on how much I actually enjoyed it. It provided a simple and accessible story, but made it feel mature and complex in its core relationships. They treat the film's characters with effort and respect, demonstrating layers that shape their outer personality and acts as drives to the logic of their decision-making. Dialogue is another thing that the film does wonderfully well, with characters seemingly distinctive and back and forth chatter that is not only hilarious but also thoughtful; it coveys its themes through the intentions and values of its characters, ensuring that the film is about them and not something much larger, like what was done in The Darjeeling Limited. The film also manages to be risky in its choice of words, bringing up themes that seem inappropriate for a young person to hear but hidden cleverly enough behind their hilarious remarks and witty substitution of particular words. They achieve all of this while also providing, assumingly, a faithful interpretation from the source material. Anderson and Baumbach have delivered a screenplay that is both superficially entertaining and emotionally insightful.\n\nThe film starts off as a fox couple who live their lives as bandits, benefiting from the riches of their loot, then suddenly Mrs. Fox announces her pregnancy which forces both of them to turn their life around and become a settled and honest family. From there, years later Mr. Fox decides to get back in the game and do one more grand scheme, but then things get out of hand and their entire community becomes affected by his actions. His journey was fun, wild, and tense; there were sequences in here that I would probably never forget, but the film is not really about the spectacle, it's about the relationships and drives of its characters. Mr. Fox is an individual who is driven by his ego, who basks in the glow of success. His sudden change to a \"normal\" life was manageable at first, but as time went by, it becomes much more difficult to live such a mundane and tedious life where no one even appreciates the writing contributions he brings to the local newspaper. His personality and high expectations also contributes to the dysfunction between him and his son, which is something Anderson treads on frequently with his films. He expects his son to be naturally talented, similar to himself, and passively shows disappointment when he isn't able to fulfil his expectations. It is relationships like these in the film, that makes these characters feel real and complex, rather than empty vessels who's aim is to push the plot forward; it also gives the film naturally earned emotions that aid in the growth of its characters.\n\nAlong with its themes of ego and family dysfunction, the film also touches on the idea of adaptation. The film shows us by the end of the film, the determination of these characters to survive in such a difficult and selfish world. In whatever habitat that these animals are put in, they are able to make the best of it, and slowly in their own way fighting and taking back from humans what is rightfully theirs.\n\nRobert Yeoman sadly does not come back here for Fantastic Mr. Fox, and that is understandable as it would take a person who has deep experience of stop-motion animation, and who better than Tristan Oliver, who has previously worked on films including Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. He is able to do this while still staying close to the vision of the director, emphasising the centred shots and the sudden push-ins and pull-outs. I also cherished the film's orange-brown warm glow to its image, giving it that earth-like feel to it. It was also disappointing to find that Mark Mothersbaugh did not come back to compose the score for Fantastic Mr. Fox, and instead done so by Alexandre Desplat. Desplat is an amazing composer, and his so-far three films with Anderson have been fantastic but there is just something about a long-time collaboration that makes it seem more connected and fantastic. Mothersbaugh brought a lot of charm to Anderson's films, and because of him a lot of his early films sound and feel beautiful. Desplat has a different approach, it has this magical, larger than life quality to his scores, and Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of his more grounded and child-like works, which suited to the film's story and characters. I don't know why I even decided to make a comparison if Desplat did an equally strong enough job in this film. I think I just cannot help but wonder on what the film would have sounded like if it Mothersbaugh was under the role instead.\n\nThe film's cast was fantastic, as expected, with new members joining Anderson's troupe; George Clooney and Meryl Streep. Both were perfect choices of casting, demonstrating effective and heavy chemistry between the two, allowing the emotional scenes of the film feel natural. The rest of the cast are familiar members of Anderson's filmography; Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Adrien Brody and Brian Cox. All of them do a wonderful job with their characters, especially Jason Schwartzman.\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox feels like a refinement of Steve Zissou, executing character-driven stories with large and ambitious action sequences; laying the groundwork for his audience of the direction of his future as a filmmaker.",

He decides to go back on his vow to his wife by performing three last chicken heists against the most dangerous chicken farmers in the land. The jobs, though successful, cause the farmers to be vindictive and attempt to destroy everything Mr. Fox loves. Now with his dishonesty in the open, he not only finds himself and his family endangered but the entire animal community as well unless he can change who he is and use his cunning wit in defense of others instead of his own personal gain.\nClever, witty, and pretty humorous. Though the animation and comedy may not appeal to some, the messages that I thought were present should ring a bell with many families. Responsibility and family over personal desires, accepting yourself if you're in the shadow of someone \"greater\", treating family with love and respect, revenge being more hurtful than good, etc etc. George Clooney was fantastic (pun) in this role. Character traits are well developed and the script was really well written. The humor was frequent, but not over bearing. The best part was seeing how Mr. Fox can change without giving up his traits that truly makes him \"fantastic\". Awesome movie. I would watch it again multiple times.",

And honestly the trailer just didn't really impress me the first time I saw it. \nBut like most of Anderson's trailers, the final product ended up being much different from the trailer, this one being for the better. \nThe script is very fast paced and fun, giving each character room to say something important or funny. The humor was also great for adults and kids to understand. I also really enjoyed how during the climax quite literally everything began falling apart. It helps show just how drastic things were getting. \nThe character of Mr. Fox is kind of a mixed bag. You will either love or hate his mischievous ways. Some of his running gags last a bit too long but I personally liked him. He's charming without overdoing it. He (for the most part) realizes when he's made a mistake and tries to fix it or do what he can with what he's got. The side characters are very fun and quirky from the goofy Kristofferson (great name by the way) to the evil farmers, who also get a couple of good laughs (\"You wrote a bad song, Petey! \") By the way, props to Desplat for another great soundtrack. \nThe animation, although tough to get used to at first, looked great and unique. This is a film that, like most of Anderson's works, sets itself apart from others. It's animation, characters, camera work, and script all make this movie one of a kind. Whether or not it's unique in a good way is up to you, but personally this was a tasty treat that was wonderful to watch.\n\n8/10 Amazing",

Now Wes Anderson is a wonderful director, probably one of the best and most original directors living today, its just that he probably wasn't the best choice for a film adaption of this beloved book.

After stealing poultry from 3 farms to satisfy his wild beast whims, Mr. Fox and his family have to dig for their lives when faced with the farmers' vengeful fury. Fortunately, this fantasy determines that the personified animals are as smart as people and in the end sly fauna takes the upper hand over Men. \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is worth for the great visual beauty, for the rich characters and the very entertaining humor. Wes Anderson's steady hand in the direction and playful pathos prevents this movie from falling into mediocre territory. I would like to see substantially more facial expression from the animal characters, there were moments of emotional or otherwise persuasive agenda that didn't quite grip me as they could. Technical limitations, I suppose. Small distraction in such a colorful and lively movie. But then again, Wes' characters are never garish in their facial expressions. I was very curious to see how the director would forge his animated subjects and, unremarkably, they are not too different from live-action counterparts.

It's full of life, fun, intricacies that just blow your mind. Whats even more amazing is that even though this is an animated outing, you genuinly feel like your there, with the cinematography being constantly on the move, follwing the insane plots/manuevers that Mr Fox gets us into, its a work of genius. Mr and Mrs Fox, played by Clooney and Streep (Wonderfully i might add), spend their time hunting down chickens from farms and doing what foxes do. One day while on the steal, Mrs Fox confesses to Mr Fox she is pregnant and that this way of life must stop. Flash forward 12 years later, they have a kid called Ash, Mr Fox is a coloumist and everything seems hunky dory. However discontent with his lack of wealth and letting his nature take over, Mr fox decides to hatch a plan to raid three different farms, the results, not only destroy the animal community but also put Mr Foxes life and family at risk. The animation is so fresh to see in this day and age, this is a dying form and its so good to see it being put to good use here. The voice acting is astounding and hilarious, for the first time in an age Clooney gives a performance we were so used to from yesteryear. The usual people show up in smaller roles, trade mark Murray, but its absolutley fine and none jarring due to the animated nature. Willem DaFoe's rat however is just the pinncacle of hillarity at one point during the film, i wont spoil. I genuinley dont have a single bad word to say against this movie apart from its seems about 5 minutes to long, that however is barely a gripe. Excellent piece of cinema and animation, forget your toy stories and your Up!'s this, my friends, is where the magic is at.",

Often square to the subject occasionally moving in a single direction. Or it's the detail crammed into every scene. It could be the no-nonsense dialog and the impeccable comic timing, or all the above. What ever it is - you 'get' it, and love Wes Anderson films. Or you don't, and you can't stand them. It's not a measure of intelligence. You either do or you don't. Happily for me, I 'get' his movies. They click, and that makes me happy! :-)\n\nThe Fantastic Mr. Fox is no exception. The stop-motion animation is superb, and really suits Wes Anderson's story telling style. The whole production is so bloody charming! Mr. Fox can't seem to control his basic animal instincts, and repeatedly (despite Mrs Fox's objections) snatches livestock from three neighboring farms. This then leads to a retaliatory strike by the farmers. Retaliation leads to escalation as the Fox family and their many friends escape the farmers and try to help themselves to everything the farmers have!\n\nIt all moves along at a great pace, and the script is sharp, surprising and always funny. I do however think this is going to appeal to big kids more.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you remember the book by Roald Dahl, be warned the movie adds to the story. If you 'get' Wes Anderson's work then you're likely going to enjoy this too. The darker tone and humor in this story may not appeal to younger kids.\n\nBest Format:\n\nIt is a visual treat, so a HD showing at home with the family could be fun.\n\nBest element for me:\n\nI loved the scenes with Mr. Fox's son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman.) A great character, trying to find his way out from under his fantastic father's shadow. He just gets the funniest dialog.\n\nAsh: You're supposed to be *my* lab partner.\n\nAgnes: I am!\n\nAsh: No you're not. You're disloyal.\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

The cast was great (to a certain extent...explain later) the visuals seemed to accurate with the tone of the book. So you might think that it is perfect...not really. It follows the book to a certain extent and they did add scenes that were unessecary and characters that were never in the book at all. The actors were great but I didn't see a character I saw/heard the actors being themselves. George Clooney plays a self centered fox that is boastful and a jerk. Sound like George Clooney to me. and the list goes on. It seemed like Wes Anderson took the source and tried to make it one of his dysfunctional family stories like he always does. Some of the dialogue and scenes seemed akward and bland. Overall its not that bad at all, it just seems bland and akward at times. The opening is boring, now big introduction (I am not saying like a musical number or anything) but it just starts off like a powerpoint slideshow. Some scenes looked like they were rushed and never finished and I think this was a product of Wes Anderson self indulgent. He directed, wrote, acted and almost seemed like he did everything so it was Wes Andersons movie and he even stated that he loves this book so of course he went crazy on it.",

            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox is an impressive, and very different animated film, brought to us by the clever and bizarre Wes Anderson. The movie is a fully realized adaptation of Roald Dahl's book of the same name.\n\nThe story follows Mr. Fox who lives with his wife, and his young pup Ash. As soon as Mr. Fox learned he would be having a kid, he decided to get out of the chicken stealing business for good. Although, he missed it, he took up work as a columnist for the local newspaper. One day, Mr. Fox announces how displeased he is with being poor, denouncing the absurd idea of living in a 'fox hole'. Soon, Fox and his buddies team up to rob the three big farms in town of all their chicken and alcoholic apple cider. The schemes are smart and sly, but draw enough attention to initiate all out war between the animals and the farmers.\n\nThis is easily one of the more interesting animated movies I've seen. First off, the story is nothing ground breaking. It's a funny one, but nothing that's completely outside the box. That being said, it's still a good story. The one thing you first notice with Fantastic Mr. Fox, is it's awesome animation style. There are a lot of beautifully 3D rendered animations coming out all the time, but it's once in a blue moon a filmmaker comes out and injects something new into the same old song and dance. Not only that, but Wes Anderson gives the film a great balance of humor that caters to both children and adults. All great voice overs from Clooney, Streep, Bill Fucking Murray, and Schwartzman.\n\nAlong with his familiar cast, Wes Anderson did not forget to bring in his style when creating this one. It's a Wes Anderson through and through, and by now his style has helped create a name for himself. It's abstract, weird, awkward, and clever, with razor sharp banter like dialogue. The writing is one of the stand out key elements beyond the great animation and art direction. I love the style of this movie though. It's like Wes Anderson didn't decide to just make a movie about Roald Dahl's book, but made it his own. He put the Anderson stamp on it, and it feels like every one of his other movies, which is awesome. It's like if Scorcese one day decided to create a cartoon film about the mafia crime scene. It might be a toned down cartoon, but you know who made it even if the form of film is not traditional to the filmmaker.\n\nAlthough, the movie is great in many aspects, I didn't feel the heartwarming vibe it tried going for. There's a moral to this story, but it's somewhat squandered beyond the constant dry joking character interaction. It's subtle and deadpan humor, that kind of fails to insert that loving, moral bit. The movie could go on even longer than it did, although that could possibly ruin it too. It's a short, fun, cartoon, that could make anyone smile. That's the one thing that makes this one fresh.\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox is an innovative, awesome looking animated flick with the bonafide style of  Wes Anderson in it, that benefits from great characters, writing, and direction.",

The story itself moves at the same quick speed as well which works great since there is practically no useless filler material, making it very hard for anyone to lose interest. They often use different camera angles for the escape/rescue scenes which adds another dimension to the storytelling while also invoking a few more laughs. Much like Pingu (anyone remember that?) or Robot Chicken (anyone heard of that?), 'Fantastic Mr Fox' uses stop-motion animation. This distinguishes it from what has become your bog standard cartoon animations of late, allowing it to implement its own unique styles of visual humour. \n\nYou may be sick of hearing them giving birth in your garden 4 times a week or leaving a mess on the street after rummaging the bins for your fried chicken leftovers but this is one fox that should leave you happy.",

The musical score was definitely the high point of the film! Simply brilliant. However, never having read the book, the film itself does not seem to have a point to it. If one watches it and disregards that it's a children's book originally, one would ask themselves \"what the heck is the point of this thing???\" despite it being rather entertaining. Also, the actors did an excellent job with the voice-over, especially George Clooney, and it was lovely to hear Meryl Streep's voice!\n\nOverall, it is definitely a good film, but keep in mind that it does not necessarily have a point to it. It's a children's story turned into a film. Fun, but not very deep/challenging",

The stop motion animation is excellent and sets the quirky tone for the rest of the film. Anderson and his screenwriter Noah Baumbauch throw in inside jokes and adult humor without being self-indulgent or crude. Great use of music throughout plus plenty of great voice acting especially by Schwartzman and Wes Anderson's own brother Eric. A visually successful film that is creatively and meticulously designed. A true triumph of animated filmmaking and Anderson becomes one of the few live action filmmakers to be successful in animation arts.",

The movie itself  is visually striking, and it presents one of the more significant achievements in animation in the past decade - a nice contrast to all of the CGI movies being released. In short, this movie is cussing hilarious, and I love the cuss out of it.",

George Clooney had the easiest job of his career by just putting on a quirky voice and reading lines. There's a lot to be had here. The stop-motion adds to Anderson's style. I don't think this movie is for everyone, but it was entertaining and very thought provoking, especially for an animated movie. Very funny, and very sweet.",

Fantastic Mr.Fox the movie adaptation itself is fantastic. I guess I could argue that a lot of scenes that weren't from the book were added to the movie to make the film longer but that's just nitpicking.

He is the perfect choice for a family animation as his voice is heart warming and gentle; this is why he should have stayed well away of the Batman role in 1997.\r\n\r\nAlso cast is comedy legend Bill Murray, Meryl Streep, the veteran Williem Dafoe and Owen Wilson. Each deliver amicable performances which can be deemed acceptable by any standard. A solid back up cast.\r\n\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with the plot of Fantastic Mr. Fox is basically follows the journey of Mr. Fox and his family as they attempt to avoid the merciless capture of three farmers.\r\n\r\nThere are some nice touches to this film and it has a quirky feel throughout; although as I am familiar with the story it didn't have much else to offer.

The problem with this film is that it's good aspects equal it's bad aspects and so it really doesn't feel right with me. There are three categories that I'll talk about, and each one I'll have reasons of why I liked parts and didn't like other parts. The three categories are \r\n\r\nVisuals - I'm not going to lie, I LOVE stop animation films. Nightmare Before Christmas blows my mind with how well animated it is, and I honestly couldn't tell that it was stop motion the first few times through. Fantastic Mr. Fox is clearly stop motion, and sometimes that works to it's advantage, other times no. For example, the style of the action scenes makes it kind of funny, and when characters get electrocuted, it has a stop motion comedic appeal of seeming like it was poorly made. The film also has visual appeal of never really having a boring shot. The cinematography is excellent. However, the problem with the film lies in emotional visualization. It's hard to tell how a character is feeling based off of the expression on their faces. They have flat expressions and their mouth movements also hurt the ability for characters to LOOK how they feel. This will immediately cause problems for some if not most viewers, as it makes it awkward to watch. It's kind of sad that a skeleton from 1993 has better visual emotions than a fox from 2009.\r\n\r\nWriting - Writing for me does not include plot development and character progression, but this is limited just to writing dialogue and scenes. The dialogue has it's good moments and bad moments too. It falls into a comedic trap that makes the film not very funny. This trap is actually a formula for jokes in the film. Here's the formula -\r\n\r\nSomebody does/says something, usually illogical\r\nSomebody else questions the logic of the previous person\r\nThe first person tries to defend/explain themselves, etc.\r\n\r\nBasically, I could have written every joke in this movie just by watching one scene, because that's how it feels. I think Wes Anderson believes that comedic situations in films like this can only come from a self-awareness, and that's a major problem with this film, everything feels too self aware. If you watch (and this is an odd comparison) an episode of Spongebob Squarepants,SPECIFICALLY earlier episodes, you'll notice that it hardly ever breaks self-awareness, and when it does, it's usually a character like Squidward or Plankton and nobody else questions it. An example - the episode where Squidward throws Spongebob back into the kitchen, and then all of a sudden Spongebob is back with him saying \"this is serious!\"... Squidward is shocked that Spongebob was able to get there so fast, but nobody else notices. It's funnier this way when nobody is actually aware that they're actors in a crazy cartoon. \r\n\r\nFantastic Mr. Fox, however, does it all wrong in that sense, by having the characters constantly question logic decisions of other people (of which the decisions might even be movie cliches, thus giving Fantastic Mr. Fox a sense of \"meta\"). We know the universe is illogical, we don't need you to constantly be a voice of reason. Comedies are funnier when there is NO voice of reason, and the only potential voices of reason are treated as unimportant or even crazy, or just ignored altogether.\r\n\r\nA positive of the writing, however, is that things happen quick often, requiring people to pay attention. What I'm saying is that it got it's pacing right, but it's jokes usually fall flat. \r\n\r\nPlot and style - The film's visual style is ok, but it's choice of music is all wrong. The film feels like it has way too much nostalgia for the 70's. Of course, this is to feed the machine of hipsters and older viewers who care for that kind of thing, but it's unnecessary. I mean, yes, it's an adaptation of a 70's book, but if I want a Dahl adaptation with a 70's feel, I'll go watch Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which was MADE in the 70's. I'm not saying that I want it to be full of people texting or whatever, but there's such a thing as timeless appeal, and if you're going to make a timeless movie you have to not date it so. Willy Wonka, despite all of it's 70's dated looks of characters, still kind of exists in it's own world. The factory is timeless because no matter what era you're from, it's still an odd factory, and the parts outside of the factory definitely don't give off a strictly 70's vibe. The film still feels fresh because it never openly said \"this is the 70's\", whereas the REMAKE happened to feel dated for much the opposite reason, making it TOO obvious what time period it was supposed to be, and also having CGI, which usually makes something look dated.\r\n\r\nBasically, what I'm saying with Fantastic Mr. Fox is that it lacks the clear timelessness of many other \"family films\", simply because it tries to feed the indie audience by giving it a strictly 70's vibe, which alienates viewers who AREN'T fans of The Beach Boys or The Rolling Stones (keep in mind, I know that the songs used are pre-70's, but they would have been played on the radio during the 70's anyways). The film's style just lacks an inclusive feel. It's exclusive to the hipster/indie fanbase and it kind of makes it hard for me to watch.\r\n\r\nThe plot progression I actually thought was decent. The beginning portion of the film was \"meh\", and the end was \"meh\", but the middle portion was good. Of course, Roald Dahl's book is just the middle portion of the film, but I'll give credit to the film-makers for doing a good job adapting the book in that sense, giving it a proper pacing and so on.\r\n\r\nThe characters are sometimes bland and other times decent. Mr. Fox is not the most interesting protagonist, and I honestly don't understand why they follow him, although they show that he's definitely the best fit to be a leader, so it's excused that he seems somewhat dumb (his plan that he develops to grab all of the farmer's supplies while they have all of their men out of the factories was something I came up with long before Mr. Fox came up with it). His wife is also bland, a boring \"you shouldn't do it\" character. His son is kind of bland too. His nephew was interesting to me, albeit a character I've seen plenty of before (the character being the person who has done nothing wrong but still creates a strong amount of jealousy in another character). The possum was a good character as was Franklin Bean. The rest I was indifferent to.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, after all of that, why am I giving it a 70%? I seemed to not like it that much. Well what I'm saying is that I haven't quite seen a film like it, although elements of it are just treading the same water that I usually hate. I can't stand the indie film scene, because a large amount of it is warm-hearted manufactured BS that gets away with praise because of being indie and stylistic. I've seen too many happy ending stories and throwing in quirkiness like indie films do doesn't somehow make it better that I'm being manipulated. I prefer films with realism to their craft, such as Kubrick's films where it's not necessarily winners or losers, and it's not necessarily the ones we want to win who do. I'm not against happy endings, but it has to have a sense of realism to it. A great example of a happy ending that works is This is Spinal Tap, where it's not necessarily the infallibility of the characters or the lesson learned or the ridiculous luck of survival that leads to a happy ending, but instead an agent of circumstance. I prefer happy endings to not force their way into a plot, but instead ease their way into a plot by having the characters ACTUALLY develop. The sense of realism has to start from the beginning and work it's way to the end.\r\n\r\nI know it's odd to talk about realism with an animated film, so I'll shorten my review to this - the film has it's problems, and is generally another \"indie\" film that falls into indie cliches in order to make the film seem unique and quirky. I don't like that, but I appreciate the efforts of the people involved and I wasn't mad watching it, I just happened to not laugh. It's not a very funny movie, although it can be somewhat funny at times, but I recommend it as a great visual piece with elements of actual GOOD film-making mixed in between the expected indie quirks and sub-Pixar animated phoniness of character development.",

Funny thing is that although its fixated to please adults, the style is so artistically over-the-top, wild, and comical that this adventure is a lot of fun for the kids as well. \n\nNow, by how \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" has been described so far, it should seem like the narrative would be executed in a sort of clustered but calculated way, right? Nope, Wes Anderson rightfully keeps it clean and linear: it's the perfect balance of whimsical dialogue and themes, and the eccentric personality. Luckily, this linearity's coupled with good-hearted themes and a soft heart. And what a tribute to Roald Dahl's book; rendered to an almost complete picture-book-esque style, the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The composition, the stop-motion technology, and the colors really pop out of the screen. The style is so overbearingly superb, the narrative just doesn't reach the same caliber throughout. Yes, the pacing is even and the voice-acting is all around great, but the entertainment value of the entire picture doesn't quite manage to deliver the same affection as its style. No need to worry-- it's not overbearingly fixated on art-house visuals that they complete alienate the children. \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is still a lot of fun, but compared to many animated movies out there, it's on the short end of the stick.\n\n\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is a fantastic (sorry, had to do it) art-house animated movie that's firing on all cylinders; it's got a great ensemble and an atypical screenplay coupled with eye-popping visual flair -- just don't expect this to be a wild ride as you would imagine a wild ride to be. The VISUALS are wild and eccentric, and there may be quirky moments within the plot, but \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" keeps its composure throughout.",

But after 12 years, the bucolic existence proves too much for Mr Fox's wild animal instincts. Soon he slips back into his old ways as a sneaky chicken thief and in doing so, endangers not only his beloved family, but the whole animal community. Trapped underground and with not enough food to go around, the animals band together to fight against the evil Farmers - Boggis, Bunce and Bean - who are determined to capture the audacious, fantastic Mr Fox at any cost.\r\n\r\nThere have been many of Roald Dahl's books brought to the movie world. We've had movies such as James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches, The BFG and now Fantastic Mr. Fox, which has proven to be quite the diamond. The story is brilliant which is to be expected since it's based on a Roald Dahl book, the animation is bright and colourful and is simply superb as it uses the original classic stop motion animation. The voice acting has no faults and the characters were beautifully written and a lot of fun to watch. It's guaranteed to leave you grinning from ear to ear after you finish watching it.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the trailer for this movie, I must admit I did have some doubts but after putting them aside and watching the movie, I could see I had nothing to worry about as this is truly a classic animation for children and adults to watch. The humour involved in the movie is great and timed perfectly. It surprised me as well because, and I don't know if this is me but, the animation looked choppy and kind of slow yet when watching the animation, it was nice and smooth and ran perfectly. Almost everything about Fantastic Mr. Fox was near enough perfect to how a family animation should be. However, nothing is ever perfect and I doubt I'll ever see a perfect movie. Having said that, this movie comes pretty close to being the perfect family movie. I really do recommend this movie to everyone as I have yet to find a person who didn't fall for the charm of Fantastic Mr. Fox. This will definitely keep the whole family entertained and adults and children will adore it. I thank the cast and the crew for bringing such a classic story to life and making it fantastic.",

I had never seen those characters in any other film.\r\n\r\n Mr. Fox is cunning, clever, swift, wild, and selfish. Mrs. Fox is generous, kind, aggressive, helpful, and artistic. Boggis is fat, mean, selfish, hates animals. Bunce is short, white, mean, angry, and ugly. Bean is scary, tall, smart, bad temper, mean. The characters were good because they were funny. There were lots of special effects. There is music in the film. The film was about the foxes that got a new home. It was a fantastic movie. The film started like this Mr. Fox and Mrs. Fox went to get chicken then they got trapped in a cage then they went home Mrs. Fox was pregnant then she had a boy called Ash then they had breakfast then Mr. Fox got a new home then Kristofferson came to swim with Ash then it was dark then Kristofferson   was crying under the table then Ash turned on the train then Mr. Fox went out with Kylie to get chicken then they went again in the dark with Kristofferson then they heard something  then they were digging underground then they another  noise came then they had to dig again and again and again then they saw something digging in a hole then it was the badger and all of his friends too then the badger got mad at  Mr. Fox then they heard another noise then they were digging a hole again then they stopped then Mr. Fox made a plan then the people put water in the hole then Ash and Kristofferson went to get Mr. Foxes tail then they went to eat then they ran away then Kristofferson got captured in a cage then they went  to get Kristofferson then the dog was tearing Mr. Foxes tail then they went home and was dancing in a store The End.\r\n\r\nI liked this film overall it was funny and it doesn't remind me of anything. I liked the part when the badger got crazy eyes, my favorite part was the badger had crazy eyes then Ash went swimming and Kristofferson was sleeping under the table and I didn't like the part when Mr. Fox lost his tail I would like this film a lot if the film was longer and funnier. I think that little boys and girls would like this film. I recommend it to my brother because he never saw fantastic Mr. Fox  before, I think I would give this film a mark out of 5.5",

George Clooney voices a likeable Mr Fox but as with most Roald Dahl tales, it's the evil doers who are the most fun.  The three farmers are the most memorable and interesting characters in the movie, as well as their henchmen, Willam Dafoe, in fine voice as an effeminate ninja rat.\nThe films script is amusing and guaranteed to raise a smile, even if the joke of inserting the word 'cuss' every time a character swears does grow old after the first half of the film.\nThe animation style will not be to everyones tastes.  It does take some getting used to.  There are times when you feel like you've almost got to squint at it to see what is happening which gets a little distracting.  It's a bold move to use this stop motion animation style rather than a straight forward cgi/Pixar style but it's a bit much for a whole hour and a half.\nFantastic Mr.Fox is an amicable enough movie.  It's not likely to be supplanting Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory atop anyone's favourite Roald Dahl films but it's a nice, empty half term afternoon killer.",

It's chock full of great character moments and some very funny one-liners, all while managing to keep a grip on the story mechanics and the actual reality of it all. My only complaint, as if there could be any, is that it all goes by so fast and feels too short.

Clooney is a perfect voice for Mr. Fox and Bill Murray as the badger is another smart choice.  Overall the movie was much better than expected and could probably be watched by both kid and adult.",

Not everyone admires Anderson's style in his films, and his style does translate directly into Fantastic Mr. Fox. The combination of this style of animation, Wes Anderson's filmmaking, a solid voice cast, and a children's story makes Fantastic Mr. Fox into one refreshing whole. Its nice to see a film (or animated film for that matter) have a level of creativity that surpasses most films in release today. \n\nHere's an interesting suggestion: what if Anderson collaborated with Pixar on a film? What would be the result? Chances are the movie watching population will never find out, but it poses some thought on the possible results of an unusual collaboration in Hollywood today.",

The voice acting was easily recognizable (Clooney and Streep as the leads), and most of the WA crew make an appearance (Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman), which is a plus. It feels much more like a Wes Anderson original rather than a Ronald Dahl adaptation. It took me a whopping 10-15 minutes to go from hating the worn and dull stop motion animation to loving it, so I guess it grows on you. Oh, and the slang humor was absolutely hilarious: they took your average Wes Anderson film, which usually gets an R rating for some language, and they replaced the swears with the word \"cuss\", i.e. \"You scared the cuss out of us!\" Now that may not sound funny here in writing, but trust me, it works.

            "content": "Here's a movie with a boastful title that truly lives up to its name! Adapted to our wit's end by film nerd Wes Anderson and fellow director Noah Baumbach from a Roald Dahl children's story, FANTASTIC MR. FOX is such a joyous movie viewing experience that my face hurt when its all-too-brief running time came to an end. I was smiling that much.\r\n\r\nWes Anderson is a well-loved director in film snob circles, but I have to confess that, until now, I've always appreciated and respected him far more than I've ever enjoyed him. His filmscapes are so meticulously created down to the finest detail that they have felt vacuum-sealed, devoid of air. His quirky characters have all circulated in worlds of white, Holden Caulfield-like privilege: boarding schools, families detached by their own wealth, pasttimes of the rich. I have always had a hard time getting into these stories, and yet I've always noticed a genius comic timing and a batch of discussion-worthy, quirky and insecure characters absent from the majority of films in need of them.\r\n\r\nFANTASTIC MR. FOX has all of the comic timing and quirkiness, but this time, Anderson focus his anal-retentive eye for details on the art of stop motion, to the point where he slows down the film's frames-per-second to specifically draw attention to the medium itself. The result is, frankly, pure genius. Tempered color palates and visual symbolisms, sly dialogue, symbolic mise-en-scene.\r\n\r\nBut this fox is truly a sly one. It is, at times, silly to the point of being giddy. It will remind audience, I'd suspect, of a Wallace and Gromit cartoon, with the misadventures of animals on display for humans to enjoy. But Anderson takes even further the notion that we are truly spying on the animals' world. These are not Disney animals, made to personify human character traits. Rather, they are busy and fussy creatures who are irritated by us humans, and they are no longer willing to sit by idly without doing something about it.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know the basic story, Mr. Fox used to pull off some sneaky heists in his day but is now a domesticated father and husband who welcomes his nephew for an extended vision. But - as the film reminds us more than once - he is still a wild animal, and his urges have never left him. One more heist, he insists. The classic heist film convention...this is my last one. So Fox rounds up a few helpers but unloads a ridiculous plan. The heist will be three-pronged, seeking revenge on not one but three local farmers who have in some way or another terrorized the local animals.\r\n\r\nPlayed by George Clooney, who does little to affect a different cadence or sound than the George Clooney of any other film he's in, is perfectly dry here, resulting in gut-splitting hilarity in moments such as when Anderson and Baumbach replace the typical foul language of adults with the word \"cuss.\" The joke never got old. Clooney inserts \"cuss\" in every part of a sentence just as we creatively use the f-word today.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the vocal cast is equally great, with Meryl Streep (what a year for her!) as Mrs. Fox, Jason Schwartzman (an Anderson staple) as their son, Ash, and Bill Murray (another Anderson favorite) as a badger.\r\n\r\nThe script is Award-worthy. It is ridiculously clever to a fault, pure joy from start to finish. I can't type enough superlatives about it. Nor can I do justice in words to compliment what was clearly a daunting feat of artistic direction. As with all Anderson creations, the images in the film don't exist simply to tell the story. They are pictures to be mined for information on repeat viewings, rich with symbolism and cultural psychology.\r\n\r\nI would have to say that FANTASTIC MR. FOX was not only my favorite animated film of the year, but perhaps one of my favorite films, period. It has made me want to dive back into the Anderson filmography and, perhaps, give some of his stuffy, formalist comedies another shot.\r\n\r\nWere you planning to skip this one? The cuss you are! See it NOW. You will fall in love, too.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's films are traditionally quirky and full of complex themes, and his adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox is no different. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's animated (stop motion); this material is not targeted at children.\n\nWhen we join the story, Mrs. Fox (Streep) is telling Mr. Fox (Clooney) that she's pregnant. The two proceed to rob a chicken farm and narrowly escape capture. Mrs. Fox makes him promise to look for other work now that they are about to become parents. Mr. Fox agrees and finds a job writing a newspaper column.\n\nMr. Fox settles down in his new life, but always regrets giving up his old ways. He's also tired of living in a hole in the ground and wants a better home for his family. He goes to see Badger (Murray), who advises him about properties for sale in the area. Fox wants a house near three local farms, but Badger suggests that the neighborhood is too dangerous. The local children even have a rhyme about the farmers:\n\nBoggis, Bunce and Bean\nOne fat, one short, one lean\nThese horrible crooks\nSo different in looks\nWere nonetheless equally mean\n\nFox is aware of the danger, but yearns for his former chicken-stealing days. As Anderson regularly reminds us, these are wild animals. Fox can't deny his nature and buys the new house so that he can be close to the three farms.\n\nHis decision goes directly against his promise to his wife and that was his first mistake.\n\nThere's a lot of humor in the film, but it's generally quite subtle. The family sits down to eat dinner and they eat like wild animals. The food is gone in seconds. Their son, Ash, is moody and craves attention from his father. He spits on the floor when he's angry or disappointed and he clearly has problems. When his cousin Kristofferson comes to stay, the situation worsens. Fox seems to favor Kristofferson over his own son and compliments him constantly.\n\nForget that we're dealing with animals for a moment and think about the story. If that happened in a regular movie, we would be dealing with a typical family drama. Husband and wife break promises and have trust issues, while their son is being raised by parents who don't understand him. This is not the kind of story that small children would understand, although some of the scenes are funny and contain action that would appeal to a child.\n\nFox enlists the help of Kylie Opossum and the two steal chickens from Boggis. The action is typical animated fare and the way the two sneak around is funny. They lace blueberries with a sedative to get past the dogs and the way the dogs react is also funny. They successfully steal from Bunce and plan to stop once they steal cider from Bean. For the final robbery, Ash wants to come along. Fox won't let him, but allows Kristofferson to take part. He seems to have very little idea that such a decision could hurt his son's feelings.\n\nThe robberies are fun to watch, especially when the animals wear bandit hats. It reminds me of the robbery in Bottle Rocket when the participants decide to wear similar hats even though their victims have already seen their faces.\n\nAsh yearns to be an athlete and wants to emulate his father's success at Whack-Bat (a game which parodies cricket). Kristofferson is a balanced individual who regularly meditates and knows karate. Ash is extremely jealous of his cousin and his ability to win his father's approval.\n\nThe three robberies annoy the farmers, so Bean (Gambon) decides to organize the trio and plans to kill Fox. This is where the film starts to take on a more serious tone. Mrs. Fox discovers that her husband has been lying to her and scratches his face in a fit of temper. This scene annoyed one of my friends who expected the film to be lighthearted and suitable for the whole family. Mrs. Fox acts like the wild animal she is. There's another scene in which one of the animals is maimed. Although it's presented in a humorous way, it could disturb people.\n\nThe remainder of the film deals with the three farmers finding ways to threaten the existence of Fox and his friends. They escape by tunneling deeper, but face the threat of starvation if they don't find a solution. Some of the other animals resent Fox for putting them in such a dangerous situation.\n\nThere's considerable peril which could worry small children, and a lot of humor which would probably fly over their heads. It was only given a PG-rating, but be aware that not every child will like this harsh world. The animals are true to their nature.\n\nThe reason I like the film so much is the style of humor. Like Bottle Rocket and The Darjeeling Limited, the characters speak with a sense of irony or sarcasm and most of the humor is tongue-in-cheek. It feels similar to Tarantino or the Coen brothers at times. There's no swearing, but every character uses the word \"cuss\" in situations in which they would normally swear. I found that particularly funny. One animal questions why a ransom note was made using words cut out of a magazine when everyone already knew the identities of the kidnappers. That's also funny to me. The missions all have elaborate titles and remind me of the way Tarantino uses chapters in his stories.\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox is an exercise in style. Mr. Fox himself is very stylish, dressing smartly and using his trademark whistle when he thinks he's being clever or cool. Clooney was a great choice for the part and the other actors all do a good job too.\n\nThe story is essentially about a dysfunctional family and shows how Ash attempts to come to terms with his existence. Will Mr. Fox eventually become a better father? Will Ash grow up and take responsibility for his own actions? Do Mr. and Mrs. Fox strengthen their marriage, or will the trust issues tear them apart? There's a lot going on beneath the surface.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson directs a visually remarkable adaptation of Roald Dahl's children's story Fantastic Mr. Fox. It's funny how I never read that book when I was a child; I was more akin to the world of Willy Wonka or the discombobulated domestic abuse of The Twits. But Dahl certainly had a style of extravagant surrealism and almost frightening hyperbole. In Fantastic Mr. Fox, the scenario is no different. Combined with Anderson's zest for black humor, this is one animated film that I'm proud to say pays homage to Dahl's legacy. \n\nThe story follows the sly Mr. Fox (cynically voiced by George Clooney) who promises his wife, Felicity, that he'll subside from a life of larceny and settle down in the farmland world. This is of course all highly fabricated. Animals cannot drive motorcycles, eat breakfast cereal, or pen columns in the local gazette. But this is Roald Dahl, not Watership Down. It appears that Anderson was truly compelled by Dahl's universe; he never pulls the punches for a second. The farmland animals are brought to life by an all-star cast, and fortunately that talent shines through. Bill Murray makes a hilarious badger, and Anderson regular Owen Wilson shines in a cameo as a gym teacher. There's also this possum named Kylie who was probably one of the finest examples of comic relief I've seen in a while. I'm still not sure what his loony eyes mean...\n\nThere's a zaniness that pervades  this film and it is not one to be trifled with. Every movement, breath, and idiosyncrasy is heightened by the stop-motion puppetry. There's a particularly evil triumvirate of farmers whom Mr. Fox rattles, and while their villainy is gratuitous, it is appropriate in this story. It's interesting to hear Michael Gambon grimace and grovel in a voice I had previously established only as the kindred Dumbledore. \n\nFantastic Mr. Fox is not entirely without flaws. The protagonist himself, because he is a fox, has little redeeming qualities. He admits that he's flawed but his species prevents him from learning from any mistake. For a children's story, I'm not quite sure what sort of message is trying to be conveyed here. The progressive absurdity that ensues (like rescuing fox Kristofferson from an attic) occasionally falls victim to petty gags. But Anderson's visuals are ubiquitous. They never cease to impress. \n\nFantastic Mr. Fox is a hilarious black comedy that adds a witticism to a children's story. For that reason, I think both adult and child audiences can find resonance in it. The children are sure to get a laugh out of the slapstick humor, the extravagant visuals, and the movement of the characters. As for the adults, they'll be asking themselves, \"What the cuss was that?\"",

The story has no problem getting from start to finish, making this one of the quickest animated films out there. Unfortunately, the film's dry sense of humor gets in the way of the story. The characters are likable, but the film lacks heart. While many critics have praised the film for being \"heartwarming\" and \"touching\", the film was actually kind of hollow. The attempts at adding character development work, but they ultimately make the film slow down. The father-son relationship seemed rushed, but the relationship between the son (Ash) and his cousin (Kristofferson) was a nice subplot. Aside from those flaws, \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" has a lot going for it. The art direction captures the autumnal setting of the film, and the character designs are creative. The scenes where Fox and Kylie steal from the three farmers are exciting and well-conceived. The soundtrack is a nice mix, including some 60s rock. (Although The Beach Boys' \"Heroes and Villains\" has nothing to do with foxes stealing squabs on a farm, ditto The Rolling Stones' \"Street Fighting Man\", which was used on the scene where the farmers use tractors to dig out Fox's burrow) It's a very quirky film and it gets a lot right, but the story needed a little work. Otherwise, it's a creative film that deserves recognition.",

This stop motion film has some of the feel of Wes Anderson, mixed with a classic story, great animation, and some outright laughs.  I mean I find Anderson's work to be quite funny on the whole, but I don't often think of them to be FUN.  This was pure fun.  Definitely some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in an animated movie, it just seemed so natural.  I think this film managed to climb easily to the top of my favorite Wes Anderson features, animated or not.",

Using stop motion sets it apart from other recent animated features that rely more on CGI,  this choice adds to the effect of the adventures of a fox that tries to fight against his own thieving nature. The animation techniques used in this film are reminiscent of cartoonish, technically sophisticated Ray Harryhausen, offering smoother movements and better character integration with the backgrounds. From a technical standpoint the style very effectively matches the story, sound effects are comedic and appropriate, lighting is appropriate for mood, and the effects are suitable to the movie's fantastic nature. \n\nVocal casting is overall well done. I loved George Clooney as the voice of Mr. Fox who adds a feeling of \"smooth\" cockiness while maintaining the ability to garner the audience's sympathy when needed. In all, this is an enjoyable film of an impulsive fox and the prices he and others must pay for his actions and it's well worth watching.",

This is coming from a pixar fan who has loved many of their movies.  But while 'Up' starts sweet, it tends to meander and divert to a conventional story.  'Fox' crackles and sizzles with so much life and humor.  It never lets up!   It should have won for best animated picture that year.  Sadly, not many people saw it, as it only made about $21 million at the box office (compared to the over $200 million that 'Up' made) I know I'm a couple years behind as this came out back in 2009, but I am glad I finally rented it!  It only cost a dollar to rent, but now I think I may find one for purchase!  There is so much awesome humor in this movie!",

Fans who are worried about this peculiar transition in Anderson's career need not be, as his stamp is surely on everything. \r\n\r\nWe are entertained with a light-hearted and playful story that remains always faithful to the children's book and the great Roald Dahl's vision, wild and quirky characters, and a beautiful setting bustling with imagination. Mix in the clever and often hilarious dialogue, all the heists, bandit hats being passed around--or the modified tube sock substitute--and you have a movie of pure delight that anyone of any age can enjoy immensely. I could not take my eyes away from the screen, and maintained a smile all the while. \r\n\r\nIt's refreshing to see George Clooney take on the voice of the sly and spunky Mr. Fox, as opposed to his more numerous, Oscar-praised performances, and who better to follow his lead than the most talented and most respected Meryl Streep as his wife, Mrs. Fox. If that doesn't have you yearning to see it, there's also Billy Murray as Badger and Mr. Fox's lawyer, Wallace Wolodarsky (who wrote for The Simpsons during the first four seasons) as Kylie the opossum and Mr. Fox's partner in crime, Jason Schwartzman as Mr. Fox's son, Ash, who spits whenever he is annoyed and is constantly trying to get his father's approval, and a nice surprise by Willem Dafoe as Rat, the night watchman of the alcoholic cider. Owen Wilson has a small role as Coach Skip--Hotbox!--and Wes Anderson even lends his voice. It's just an overall fun time watching Mr. Fox and friends use their specialties to stop three conglomerate farmers from destroying their homes; and why not off with some poultry and cider along the way? \r\n\r\nFantastic Mr. Fox is a stop-motion romp that has endless personality and vigor and is a feast for the eyes. Pixar's Up is going to have major competition for awards this year, and I'm rooting for something different. With dry humor the likes of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and the craziness of The Royal Tenenbaums, Wes Anderson has incorporated his style into every aspect of this movie, making it the best animated feature of the year. What the cuss are you waiting for? See it!",

Mr. Fox (George Clooney) is a reformed bird thief turned newspaper man, who despite a devotion to his wife and son, yearns for the excitement of his glory days. When the fox family moves into their new home (tree) near three prominent farms, Fox decides to embark upon one last heist.The Fox family dynamic is altered by the arrival of Mrs. Fox's nephew Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) who lodges in the Fox home while his father battles \"double-pneumonia.\" Fox's twleve-fox-year-old son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) is jealous of Kristofferson's talents and stature, and his father's blatant admiration thereof. As Fox squares off against the three sinister farmers, Boggis, Bunce and Bean, and tries to hide his illicit activities from his suspicious wife, (Meryl Streep) Ash struggles to outshine Kristofferson and makes his father proud.\n\nThe plot is whimsical and exciting, but as in all of Anderson's work, what really shines are the characters. Each is beautifully animated and brought to life by wonderful voice work by a cast including Bill Murray, Adrian Brody, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, and Michael Gambon.\n\nThe dialogue is hip and crisp without being gimmicky, and the timing of the interactions is pitch-perfect. There are some poignant moments, as well as some that made me laugh aloud.You'll find yourself quoting this movie for days. It's rife with brilliant and bizarre one-liners.\n\nEven if you've never seen any of Anderson's work, including \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" and \"Rushmore,\" you'll immediately identify his offbeat aesthetic. Fantastic Mr. Fox is made using stop motion animation, but Anderson's lovable visual trademarks are all here - deliberate and methodical cinematography, vintage style, vibrant color, and prominent on-screen typography. The construction of the characters and sets is charming and novel, and every frame features a stimulating palette of color and texture.\n\nRounding out the experience is a raucously excellent soundtrack, featuring The Rolling Stones, The Wellington, and Burl Ives. There's even an original tune by the on-screen avatar of Jarvis Cocker. The mix of off-kilter animation and washy 60s rock is a pure delight.\n\nI don't have much in terms of summation here, guys. Every element of the \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is fantastic, and the final product is nearly without flaw. It's poignant, funny, and a joy to behold. Simply put, it's one of Anderson's best. See this movie, folks. You won't regret it.",

In fact, one would wonder why anyone would bother making a stop motion movie, as opposed to a CGI movie.  The reason, is that stop motion has an odd, old fashioned, hand made feel to it.  And somehow, that feel has been captured and placed into this movie, and it's not just evident in the animation.\r\n\r\nFantastic Mr. Fox is inspired from Roald Dahl's picture book by the same name.  The film follows the story of Mr. Fox, who starts stealing farmer's merchandise again, without telling his wife.  Mr. Fox has been planning some \"great heist,\" despite his promises to his wife, claiming he would quit.  Soon, the three meanest farmers of them all (Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean), decide to end Mr. Fox's reign once and for all.\r\n\r\nThe film's dry humor is both witty and hilarious.  No movie in the world can stand up to the unique humor that Fantastic Mr. Fox displays.  \r\n\r\nI give points to the outstanding voice talents (namely for George Clooney and Meryl Streep), and the comedic score by Alexandre Desplat.\r\n\r\nThe animation is spectacular.  By far the best I've seen in a stop motion film.  It's truly fantastic.  Even for stop motion, it looks incredibly good fashioned, and that is a very good thing.\r\n\r\nUnlike the book, however, this is not a piece of entertainment I can recommend for younger children.  It's too dark, and they probably won't get many of the jokes (they may get a kick out of all the fuzzy animals, however).  This is more of an older kids and parents flick.\r\n\r\nFantastic Mr. Fox is fun, entertaining, unique, and visually wonderful.  It is not hard to understand why they call it \"Fantastic\" Mr. Fox.",

Even though there were even more questions that I didn't mention here, I did that so I could get to the point. After this movie was over, I was thinking about giving it a bad review, but then I thought \"Hey, I think I like this movie!\". I don't know if it was the clever jokes, the likable characters, or it's cheesy nature, but I knew that I wouldn't live with myself if I gave this a bad review. It's just.... likable.

Starting with a fox under a tree listening to the old Davey Crocket theme, and quickly going into one of my favorite Brian Wilson, Beach Boys tunes!  This movie was a total package from music to the casting.  Let's not forget about the animation which was very refreshing and engaging to watch.  The relationships of the characters were balanced just right that they were fun to watch, but were not over done or forced.   Mr. Fox's charm and personality came through as he was caught up in situation after situation.  The creativity of the film was great, when it came to eating, fighting, and their use of strong language.  the way they used the animation to work for them instead of trying to make things too perfect.  I thought the film did pretty much everything just right, except it slowed down at parts too much, for a little too long.  Although I think I'm just trying to find some flaw so I have an excuse to not give it 5 stars.  I was also happy to see Jarvis Cocker (\"Pulp\" frontman) make an appearance (Petey), as a song man and adding a bit of music.  Not to mention other songs that made cameos by The Rolling Stones, the Dave Fuller Four, and more Beach Boys!  My ears give this movie a 5 star rating for sure!  I'm not sure what took me so long to see this movie, but I'm very glad I did.  It might be a bit over the top for young kids to get the dialogue and some of the jokes, but I think they'll just enjoy some of the visuals and silliness that comes and goes.  I think this movie can speak to most age groups and will leave everyone pretty satisfied.",

            "content": "Stop Motion Animated films always fascinates me. To me, it's always fun to watch clay or puppets moving about and living their own lives. I simply love it. Fantastic Mr. Fox is based on Roald Dahl children's novel of the same name about Mr Fox and how he outwits his farmer neighbours to steal their food from right under their noses.\r\nThe stop motion animation effects used in the film were superb and really fun to just watch. The environment and characters looks were made so realistic, their fur and eyes, probably everything were so detailed. \r\nThe movie's plot focuses more on Mr. Fox's relationship to Mrs. Fox and his son, which is pitted against Mr. Fox's desire to steal chickens as a means of feeling like his natural self. The movie adds scenes before Mr. Fox attacks the three farmers and after their bulldozing of the hill, as well as a slightly altered ending and more background on Mr. Fox's past life as a thief.\r\nDevelopment on the project began in 2004 as collaboration between Anderson and Henry Selick (who worked with Anderson on the 2004 film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) under Revolution Studios. In 2007 Revolution folded, Selick left to direct Coraline, and work on the film moved to 20th Century Fox. Production began in London in 2007. This film is also director Wes Anderson's first animated film and first film adaptation. Wes Anderson did an amazing job in directing this visually beautiful picture that left me impressed knowing that this is his first time working on an animated film and more amazed, in stop motion animation. Great work indeed. Anderson directed it with a great sense  and reveals his own style of story-telling with animation, it is just entertaining from start to end. I don't find myself getting bored of the film at all, the direction and animation will keep your eyes glued on the movie all the way, and that is all that matters. \r\nVoice acting in the film was absolutely great. Hands down. George Clooney voiced as Mr. Fox, great voice acting performance given out by the Academy Award Winning Actor. I personally find that Clooney is the best choice for the voice of Mr. Fox. Meryl Streep voice as Mrs. Felicity Fox, Mr. Foxs' wife. All voice acting performances were great. Nothing to point out on it. Other voice actors includes, Jason Schwartzman, Eric Chase Anderson, Wallace Wolodarsky, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson and Michael Gambon.\r\nI am impressed throughout the whole movie. I am pretty sure that anybody would be, when they watch this family friendly adventure film. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a beautiful film that has a variety of elements in it which includes, friendship, love and adventure. One of the best animated films I have watched in a while. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a 90% FRESH for me. Visually stunning stop motion effects, amazing directing by Wes Anderson and great voice acting performances by it's cast. A great animation film to enjoy for one and all. :)",

            "content": "Yeah, probably my favorite animated movie. This is a complete delight, Wes Anderson expands his mediums while retaining his stylistics. Anderson has never been a cookie cutter or assembly line director, he has kept his esoteric style and humor beginning with his first gem Bottle Rocket. He is aquatinted with co-writer Noah Baumbach who co-wrote The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and afterward directed The Squid and the Whale. And in Fantastic Mr. Fox Anderson's style is emulated and even made better by the stop-motion animation. The tale follows Mr. Fox, (Clooney) a professional chicken and squab -whatever that is- thief who continuously goes on runs with his wife Felicity (Streep). On one occasion they are both trapped in a fox trap and Felicity reveals she is pregnant, and demands that Mr. Fox promises her to give up his current profession if they escape so they can settle down. Mr. Fox does settle down with his family, but the urge to get back to his old ways progresses then eventually spills over, and thats when the 'cluster-cuss' begins.\r\n\tThe movie is less successful at being a children's movie, but is very successful at being a crowd pleaser. The humor could be too high brow for some kids, but they will be entertained by the vivid imagery and the ambient characters. Adults would most likely enjoy the wit and charm in the writing as well a the performances by the voice actors. A higher admiration can be held  for the amazingly detailed and unique set pieces and stop-motion.      \r\n\t The usual Anderson suspects are here as well and they serve to season the Anderson flavor and put distinction into their characters. Jason Shwartzman voices Ash, Mr. Foxes son who is inept at sports and puts all his effort into becoming an athlete, while competing in the spotlight with his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) for his fathers attention. Shwartzman infuses the 'snarkyness' and quirky wit that made his character from Anderson's Rushmore so appealing. This movie is a interwoven gem through out and it's rare to see movies like these anymore as stop-motion is a rarely directed medium. \r\nYep, High fives all around Mr. Anderson and Mr. Baumbach.",
