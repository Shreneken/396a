Ever since I first saw it in the movie theaters at 9 years old it captured my heart. I am now 23 and it still captures my heart. It was just wonderfully made and produced. It really touches the heart of your inner child. It deals with the reality of many children in this world, who often have wonderful and awe-inspiring imaginations that don't always get nurtured or heard. I love the idea of the tiny door. Ever since I was a child, I always imagined an entry into another imaginary world better than my own. And for some reason that gets fulfilled in this movie. Even though it does later get revealed that, that imaginary world is a trap. \n\nNow that I'm much older, I can also see why this movie still captures the attention of an older audience. Not only does it take you back to your childhood where you once imagined a better world than yours where your parents said yes to everything you ever wanted and paid more attention to you. But it also helps you realize that at the end of the day, no matter how much we wished that imaginary world existed, unfortunately it does not. And that really, it's better to not take for granted what we do have and be appreciative of it because you never know when it can be taken away from you. Just a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it!!",

In a time when slick 3D computer animated family films with pop culture references and poop jokes dominate the marketplace, this film is a breath of fresh air. Selick also did 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach,' so he is well-versed in the stop-motion process. He creates a vivid and endlessly inventive visual feast, a world entirely all its own. His art design, cinematography (this is the first feature film ever shot with 3-D cameras), and delightful score help paint a world we wouldn't mind getting lost in. The visuals are so dense you may need to revisit the film two or three more times to catch every little detail. The voice cast, from Dakota Fanning to Keith David, Ian McShane, and Teri Hatcher, is perfect. The story is peppered with wit and whimsy and a message about appreciating the good things in your life--friends and family. It may a little too scary and dark for the most sensitive of young viewers. But kids and adult lovers of film should fall into this fantasy, hoping never to leave. A glorious animated film",

By the time I saw this again (June 24th 2021) this would be my third time seeing it and I am still scared. The whole plot for Coraline is chilling enough. But it gets even more scarier near the end \u2014 that is where it always gets me with the scares!! If we ignore the scary moments, I greatly enjoy this film quite a bit. The plot is interesting, the voicing for the characters were amazing, and this movie I have to admit is detailed. Everything about this film is great and fun to see, but when it comes to the scariness is where it's strong suit comes in hard. I am 16 years old logging this previous film I have nearly seen a year ago, and I still kind of refuse to see this film because of how scary it is! You would think a 16 year old who has seen some R-rated horror films would get over this movie, but nope! The first time I saw this I was scarred for like 2 days from this film and how freaking scary it was. I couldn't think of anything else but this film. I moved on \u2014 my second time wasn't as bad but I was still scared of this movie. My third time I think I handled it more like a pro but I was still scared. I haven't seen it for my fourth time but I should! Just to see if this movie gets me again with the scares. I know this is just a simple kid's film but man it is very effective on getting me scared out of my pants. If I was comparing this to A Quiet Place I would say this was scarier because A Quiet Place just left me on the edge of my seat, this movie on the other hand just scares my pants off!! I love this film, but yet I am too scared too take a dive a 4th time seeing this \u2014 foolish I know but it is just one of those movies that just gets with me with the scares!",

The animation in this movie was spectacular as there are lots of creepy imagery going on here with Coraline going to the other world and discovering that the other world is not as beautiful and exciting as she thinks it is.  I also really liked the characters themselves, especially Coraline, who seems like a relatable character who has to deal with her parents being so busy all the time and she is often frustrated by this.  Another character that I really liked was the Other Mother herself as she is quite a terrifying character who tries to give Coraline lots of love and things that Coraline wants, while planning to eat her.  The only issues that I have with this film are that the beginning of the movie was a bit too slow and there were some changes from the book, like the Other Father, that I didn't care for.  Overall, \"Coraline\" is a treat to behold and if you love watching scary animated films or you're a huge fan of Neil Gaiman's works, then you'll definitely enjoy this movie!",

The incredibly detailed scenery, captivating soundtrack, and the heart warming essay skilfully adapts the tone of Gaiman's graphic novel, while adding Selick's signature style creates a unique take on the plot.

Coraline slowly comes to realize that the other world is a TRAP, and that she has to be clever if she wants to escape alive... With a premise this interesting, you'd have to bring some top notch visuals to the table. And let me tell you, Selick DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. For a family film, the imagery is very creepy at times, but the animation style is so clean and sharp. Having read it in part, I can say that Coraline's screenplay is exceptional. Nearly every single detail written on paper translated well to film... But Bruno Coulais's riveting score will not be overlooked. Not will the talented voice cast... Years of hard work were put into making this film and the result is a wildly entertaining roller coaster ride, animated beautifully.

The stop-motion technique is very interesting for me, Coraline film is very smooth and has many fantasy scenes that I don't think are stop-motion. Laika studio can do the perfect stop-motion apart from humans they also do very good animal movement. Coraline has a very interesting plot story that can attract people including the name of film and main character \"Coraline\" not Caroline. In the movie people will call her name wrong and I think that part made viewers recognize her name easier. About storytelling, it is very interesting about family problems, children, including cheating. We can clearly see Coraline does not really like her parents that much. She is the little girl that needs attention and friends but her parents take her to an old house that looks goosebumps and  strange neighbors. I love the way that creators created mood and tone on character design and scenes, fade and dark tone can represent environment and the story in a good way also yellow raincoat of Coraline make her pop up but still match with her blue hair and the scene. I can't tell like my friends who said this film is a little scary and looks like a nightmare because I have liked this film since I was young. I don't know why I'm not scared like other children but I believe I'm not the only one who likes this kind of movie. Soundtrack in the movie is also pretty cool too, I love the way that I felt fall in the deep mood with the story and music. Coraline was created by Henry Selick, who made \u2018The Nightmare Before Christmas' and I love both films that are created by stop-motion and 3-D in a gloomier image but looks fantastic. I think Coraline is a very good movie that has an interesting story and good process about artwork in there.",

I first saw it when I was about 12 and had nightmares for weeks.  That said, I did come back for more and give it this 5 star rating. Coraline is more nuanced, better visually planned, and more physiologically rooted than any supernatural adult horror piece I've seen. Fraud's \u2018consuming mother' archetype is explored in a bizarre context as the film draws horror and suspense from a narrative centered around control and confinement (both literal and emotional). The other world is a delicious inversion of reality's honest monotony; it's more uncanny and rotten than Alice's Wonderland ever was and more fun too. \nCoraline is also refreshing in that it breaks regular child/young adult adventure narrative structures. It's nice to find a movie that understands how boring and restricting the limited freedom of youth can be rather than striving to capture \"the magic of childhood\". The other world and its dangers neither represent adulthood nor serve to mature and develop Coraline into a fully realized heroin. She is already brave, clever, and confident from the start. Her adventure changes how she contextualizes her world and relates to others rather than developing new traits she was lacking. She learns the classic lesson \u2018be careful what you wish for' in terms of wishing to change other people. Customizing neighbors, friends, and even family is a moral door best left closed.",

I think my favorite relationship throughout the entire movie was between Coraline and Wylie because you could see how they grew as friends. The basic plot line was interesting because it deals with a parallel universe, but Coraline was only able to enter under certain circumstances. It gave Coraline a comforting home, basically a dream land each night, yet each morning she ended back in her own boring home. All of this was to trick her into hurting herself and her family. The stop motion and screenplay was done nicely throughout the movie and I think the music breaks were nice comic relief considering this is a children's movie and some of the scenes are a bit disturbing. The movie also teaches a great lesson of \"be careful what you wish for\" because Coraline thought she was now living in an amazing dream world, but as many would say it was too good to be true. Overall, I thought the movie was really good with a lot of surprising plot twists that kept my attention, and I think everyone should give this movie a chance!",

It really speaks to a childhood that makes you question the boundaries of parenting and what is healthy for a kid but it has a beautiful fantastical element of true familial love. The animation puts you in a state of childlike wonder that is nostalgic to those of us who were in a similar position to Coraline, whether that be her new situation and surroundings or the complicated relationship that she (and many of us) share with our less-than-perfect but truly caring parents who want the best for their kids. But there's an element of wander and beauty that hides behind the ordinary, in a dark way in the other mother's realm, but the ending provoked reverse feelings. This movie shows that while beautiful, performative gestures draw attention and garner adoration, there is something to be said for the deep familial bonds that are formed from living an ordinary life and all the mishaps that come along with it. That form a dynamic that may not be the most exciting, but show true love and familiarity that everyone who grew up with loved ones understands",

That moment, Coraline was scared and shocked. I liked this part because it was so surprising and cruel. If I were Coraline, I probably would of be very scared and anxious. Also, I liked the part when Coraline was trapped inside a room with other spirits, and bravely saves herself, because I thought she was very brave and calm.

While there is a lot left unexplained, there is plenty that is exampled about the Beldam and her world.\n\nThe movie also reminds me a lot of \"The Wizard of Oz\" in a few different ways so its good that there are family friendly movies of this quality that make vague callbacks to classic movies.",

Coraline tells the story of a girl who must save herself and her parents from the danger of an evil witch. An impressive feat of stop-motion animation and visually stunning, Coraline is often remembered for it's creepy and strange atmosphere, which is set up from the very opening sequence. The sequence is accompanied by an eerie Bruno Coulais score (Dreaming being the one used in the opening) where what the audience will come to realize is the Other Mother/Beldam creating the Coraline doll that spies on our main character and her family. This opening sequence does well in setting the tone for the rest of the film, as it provides an unsettling feeling through the surgical-like sewing, long spindly hands, and haunting score that lingers even when it's over. Coraline and her parents---an eccentric father and stricter mother---have moved to what's referred to throughout the film as the Pink Palace (short for Pink Palace apartments) in Oregon. Coraline is quite quickly shown to be an adventurous and curious girl who is frustrated at the lack of attention from her parents and what she sees as a \u2018boring life'. She is often seen repeatedly complaining at different points in the film of all the other characters \u2018not listening to her'.\n\nIn comes the Other Place. Coraline discovers a door while exploring the house that leads to another world that replicates her own, but with a few key differences One, the house and the atmosphere is much brighter. While her \u2018real home' is colored with dull tones and lots of shades of greys, the Other Place is colorful and applies more cozy colors, such as shades of reds, purples, blues and oranges. Two, her parents are much more attentive in this world, much more doting and loving, with her Other Father a talented musician and her mother who always cooks delicious meals for her, provides her with everything she wants---but they have buttons for eyes (as do all the other characters in the Other Place). She soon realizes with the help of a talking Cat and the more she spends time in the Other Place that something is wrong, and discovers that her doppelganger mother wants to \u2018consume her life' as she did with three other children.\n\nThroughout the film, I found myself being reminded of Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, mostly the door that leads to another, more wondrous (appearing) world. Both films have a dark and creepy atmosphere (though arguably Pan's Labyrinth more extremely so) and employ a female protagonist who wishes to escape to a fantasy world where they believe they'll be happier. The talking Cat in Coraline shares a similar whimsical quality to Alice in Wonderland's Cheshire Cat, with its guiding nature and habitual practice of coming and going whenever it pleases. These intertextual references, though possibly unintentional, only enrich the entertaining story. It is fast-paced and witty, with the creepiness doing well to bring forth a child-like fear that even adults can remember, and concludes with a satisfying ending that brightens up the real world and Coraline's life.",

Eventually it starts to get interesting from her workaholic parents she discovered something in her house. Coraline found a secret door of an alternate universe of her life. Henry Selick have yet created another great movie from \"nightmare before Christmas\" it's the more like the same kind of setting with the dark wittiness in both of the characters. Coraline was very detailed from the story line and to the animation, watching Coraline lost in the movie had moved me into thinking I was in the alternate world. Selick imagination has made me wonder do we all have an alternate to escape to? I like how Coraline got carried away and now she has to find her way back to reality. With her button eyes and the 3D animation it helps give a good disturbing vision towards the younger crowd, the disconcerting animation made people realized Caroline designed more in depth with the movie. The message that they're showing is to never give up and accept what you have. It may not be perfect but at least you'll learn how to be strong and fight against people whom you love.",

I didn't like \"Coraline\".  I didn't get the messages the film was sending very well.  And I figure if they'd go through so much trouble as to make the film engine stop-motion, the story would be tidier and the messages more direct.  It is an Alice in Wonderland story about  rude girl who goes on a psychedelic adventure which should result in having her become a better person. Not sure if it did that for Coraline.  What is unique about this film is that the subtext message is a cautionary tale about child predators, as that is what the villain essentially is.  If it were better delivered, it would have been brilliant to me.  Nothing wrong about teaching children about that, in fact they should be taught about that.  I was put off by things meant to be humorous [there is a stage play with scantily-clad women] and scary [the villain had already been feeding off the life-essence of three children prior to trying to do the same to Coraline, but like I said that's not too disturbing given the message].  I was disturbed by Coraline not having much character growth in terms of her kindness.  But she is a determined and tenacious character worth looking up to in that sense.  I was unnerved by her family dynamic - she has neglectful parents who seem to have issues with one another too.  Should that be excused because the parents were under stress?  - They could have lost their daughter during that time.  If the message was that family members should be kinder and gentler toward each other, I wish - I really wish it would have been clearer.",

I want you to imagine your mother and father with button eyes and your life seems to be the opposite all because you went through a hole in the wall. You start to love it until your mother offers your own set of button eyes on your birthday. Thanks to the amazing and creative director of Coraline, Henry Selick, you can watch a movie about an adventurous young girl, who finds a hole in the wall and decides to explore. When she crawls through it she finds her life but a little different and peculiar. Everyone had button eyes and it all seemed perfect until she refused to give her mother her eyes that's when things took a bad turn. I think that this movie deserves a five out of five because it kept me engaged and was interesting. I was constantly wondering what would happen next and no matter how many times I watch it, I never get bored. This movie made me feel jumpy and aware of everything going on. I also wondered why it is a children\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s movie in the first place. Personally, this has been one of my favorite movies since I was little. I recommend this movie if it draws your attention and I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)m sure you will love it!",

            "content": "Into the Darkness\n\n   Coraline is the most outstanding movie Henry Selick has directed. Along with the mastermind of Neil Gaiman, both of these individuals have created a frightening eerie illusion for young adolescents. The film, of course, is grouped into \"children-family movies\" on Netflix and the recommended age is 8-10, now if you have seen this film you would agree to disagree by a long shot. Henry Selick also directed, The Nightmare Before Christmas, which have similar characteristics that come with the visuals and sounds that are used throughout these two films. Now if you know the 3D computer-animated fantasy film, Coco, you soon realize they have a familiar plot story; a young adolescent gets warped into another universe and discovers an entryway that will cause them complex obstacles throughout the movie. Now, Coraline goes through the same scenario but you quickly discover she goes to the other universe quite frequently and leads her to immense danger.\n\nThe opening credits show needle-shaped hands grabbing a doll that has button eyes, the metal hands then continue to take apart the doll and make a unique doll which we later find out it was made for Coraline. The spine-chilling film takes place in a very gloomy city and is constantly raining. Dull colors are dominant in every scene the first 20 minutes of the film. As Coraline discovers the secret passage that leads her to the parallel universe, she meets her \"other parents.\" Comparing and contrasting these characters, Coraline's father, is constantly working hard and has a long neck that looks similar to a footlong sandwich from subway, his features are rather asymmetrical and carries these blue-purple undereye bags that lead to him having droopy eyelids while on the other side he has a bright personality and enjoys the same activities Coraline is interested in. These frightful characteristics that the characters bring in every scene are very daunting and make you feel intimidated by the way they interact with each other as well every action they do.\n\nMuch like The Nightmare Before Christmas, the ominous setting takes place in a daunting and scary feel like due to the lack of bright visuals. They use stitched up features for the characters as well as masks and Halloween related makeup, audios, and visuals. Her upstairs neighbor is an odd Russian acrobat who claims to have trained mice and her downstairs neighbors are two elderly women who are burlesque dancers. In the other universe, they are transformed into younger versions of themselves with a more amusing personality and do enjoyable entertainments for Coraline and Wybie, her friend. The most frightening thing about these characters you may ask? Well in the other universe when Coraline's \"other mother\" asks her to complete complex tasks to gain her parents back ( The other mother stole her parents so Coraline could trade in her eyes for button eyes) she has to go to her upstairs neighbors home and also downstairs. First, she goes upstairs, where her Russian neighbor resides and finds that he has no head attached to his body, nor arms and legs. Mice are maneuvering every action he makes and has nobody structure, he slides throughout the room like a human snake to get from one point of the room to another. He continues to talk in a low-deep slow voice that sounds rather intimidating. At the beginning of the film, you would've never guessed how oddly these characters would get distorted.\n\nAs she progresses onto her neighbors downstairs, the burlesque dancers, there is a giant candy shaped ball wrapped in white paper hanging from the ceiling. Coraline comes in and rips open the package and the two dancers come out wrapped around each other, they look lifeless and have facial expressions that seem like they had suffered. And you know what is the scariest part? Their limbs are weaved in together making them inseparable but Coraline has to unweave them to get to the item that is necessary for their parents to escape the hands of the \"other mother\". What made me startle and jump in my seat was the fact that they came back to life miraculously and make a sharp sudden drop in the music and screeching of the creatures! I was already on my toes when she first walked in and saw the giant candy shaped ball.\n\nWhen Coraline wins the game and returns back to her starting point, the \"other mother\" is waiting for her return. She is sitting in the living room eating BEETLES! She bites the head of the beetle and you can see the muscle tissue on the beetle start to spaz. As Coraline continues to say no to the button eyes, the other mother quickly gets infuriated by her decision, she becomes to transform into a bony structure that makes her unrecognizable and resembles a long tall skeleton. The reason she goes through this journey is to find the eyes of the children that the other mother had taken. The eyes represent the souls of the children that were taken from the other mother. She finds her parents trapped in a snowglobe before departing from the other universe! YAY!\n\nAs you can tell by this point of my review, I really enjoy this movie. If you enjoy creepy, spooky eerie films that make you feel tingly skin and spine-chilling entertainment, you will love this movie! Along with similar films such as The Nightmare Before Christmas. You won't be disappointed when you sit down and watch this film expecting it to be a children's movie when in reality it will scare them to the point where they won't watch to watch it ever again! So it's a win-win situation. A life lesson and good entertainment for the win!",

            "content": "The finest claymation film ever.\n\nDirector Henry Selick did it again with Coraline (2009) thanks to his innovative mastery of animated direction. Selick gave us James and the Giant Peach as well as The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline is just a brilliant. Coraline is a fast paced short horror film for children essentially. It brings lush colors and creepy visuals together for a unique cinematic experience totally its own.\n\nI must mention the sheer amount of detail put into each character's design and costumes. The knit clothes and fluid movements make the animation in Coraline top tier. This is as impressive as claymation gets in my opinion.\n\nCoraline's wonderful story is written by the genius author Neil Gaiman and Coraline is another one of his great works. The writing is very funny, sarcastic, and clever. From the numerous omens alongside the setups and payoffs work great on camera. Gaiman's themes range from family and longing to disappointment and expectations. The moral is simply to appreciate what you have and be careful what you wish for, but Coraline goes about this concept in a visually sublime way.\n\nThe few musical numbers really stand out as the overall tone is like a rainy day spent at home. I love the vocals talents of Dakota Fanning, Ian McShane, Keith David, and especially Teri Hatcher. Hatcher pulls off multiple characters and every emotion you can think of displayed solely through her voice acting. Coraline has a great voice cast who all bring more charm to these odd, but lovable characters.\n\nIn all, Coraline is wonderful for families to watch together, but I think even adults would find something to enjoy. Coraline puts life into perspective with all its quaint warmth and scary chills.",

Wyborne is so adorable, even if his creation was to Coraline uses him like a stairs to talk. The pun that Coraline make with his name is hilarious: Wyborn-Why-were-you-born. And, of course, Coraline is different, she is somethink lost in her own mind, angry and stubborn, but is perfect to the movie; Dakota Fanning was the right person to dub her, and did it in the better way.\n\nWhy am I giving 9 stars and not 10 to the movie? Well, the problem with children's movies is that the critical moment is always slow to unwind and tiring to watch, but I understand that it is for childrens and have to be that way, I don't like, may I'm wrong.

            "content": "Coraline is a dark fantasy claymation film that was released in 2009. It made a total of 35.6 million at the box office. It follows the story of Coraline, a young girl just moved to a new town. With no friends, and parents who pay no attention to her, she longs for a world where she is loved. After finding a secret door in her home, it transports her to a world where \"Everything's better... but it's all a trap.\" Although it is rated PG, most do not consider it a suitable movie for children. This has caused some controversy over the movie, causing people to dislike it. However, the purpose of this essay is to show that coraline is a well made film because of its unique characters, meaningful theme, and it's animation. \nPart of what makes \"Coraline\" such a good movie is the characters. There are so many unique and interesting characters in this story. Coraline, for example, is far from your everage eleven-year-old girl portrayed in film. Roger Ebert explains in his movie review of the movie that, \"She's unpleasant, complains, and has an attitude\". It is refreshing to see a contrast from the happy-go-lucky little girl that most films portray. Another great character, frightening as she is, is the Other Mother, also known as the Beldam. Ebert states that, \"'Coraline' is disturbing not for gory images but for the story it tells. That's rare in itself: Lots of movies are good at severing limbs, but few at telling tales that can grab us down inside where it's dark and scary.\" It takes a very well made character to be so terrifying without falling back on the use of gore. A lot of skill is required to create such dimensional and interesting characters, and they are what help bring this story to life. \n\tThe theme \"Be careful what you wish for\" is shown through the startling film, as Coraline soon realises that this \"magic world\" she wished for is anything but a paradise. Although Coraline's life could be better, she lives in a good home, with all the basic necessities, and her life could certainly be worse. Wishing for this utopian world where everyone worships her is what brought the curse of the Beldham upon her. By the time that she realizes that she wants no part of this sinister world, it is too late, and the Beldham has her in her trap. Not wanting to become one of the Other Mother's \"dolls\", she makes a deal with her and is able to save herself, her parents, and the lost souls that had been imprisoned. Not only is this film able to show the theme in a striking way, but it is also able to be resolved to give viewers a sense of conclusion. \n\tAnyone who has viewed this film can concede to the fact that \"Coraline\" has beautiful animation. After 83 weeks of filming, this stop motion claymation film was brought to life. Being the first film of its kind to be offered in 3d, it took a even deeper step to pull viewers into this dark world. Not only is the cinematography aesthetically pleasing to watch, but it helps set the mood of the entire film. Every scene helps bring about the gloomy, uneasiness of the film. Even in scenes where the other world is made up to be a bright, beautiful place, the style and animation make it hard to trust that this place is truly harmless. It is easy to observe all the hard work put into making this film what it truly is - a masterpiece. With years in pre-production and filming, it is difficult to not be in awe at every scene. \n\tOn the other hand, some people say that \"Coraline\" is a bad film because it is scary, and marketed as a children's film. This point of view makes sense because the film is rated PG, and it is quite terrifying at times. However, the official genre of  \"Coraline\"is a fantasy thriller. In the rating it says that there are frightening images. Parents should be well aware of what kind of movie they are having their children watch, and know their child well enough to know whether or not they would be able to handle the content in the film. A. O. Scott explains in his review of the film that, \"the cultivation of fright can be one of the great pleasures of youthful moviegoing.\" Many children enjoy a bit of a scare, so it is unfair to judge a film based on the ignorance of parents. \nThere are many elements of 'Coraline\" that make it such a great movie. The characters are very unique, and make the story interesting. The theme holds a good lesson and is portrayed through the film very well. The animation helps show the mood of this film, and makes it aesthetically pleasing. It is important that we give \"Coraline\" the credit it deserves, instead of just blindly assuming that it is a bad film. It is important to make decisions for ourselves, and go into anything - movies, classes, etc - with an open mind. Otherwise, you may miss out on something very extraordinary.",

            "content": "Strengths: What a gorgeous looking movie. The stop-motion animation is done incredibly well here. Everything just looks so great. The story is also great, with the right amount of twists and buildup. Things get progressively more creepy as it unfolds. The film does a tremendous job in balancing the scary with the fun for the kids. I'm sure the comparison has come up before, but I kept getting The Nightmare Before Christmas vibes. Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is a strong, flawed lead and her relationship with the Cat (Keith David) was a highlight. There's also a well-crafted family message at the end of it all.\n\nWeaknesses: One issue I had was that the antagonist (Teri Hatcher) didn't quite feel like a great villain. I'm not sure what I'd have added to improve that off the top of my head, it's just something that could've been done better. While I feel Coraline is a strong lead, I wouldn't call her likable. She has several moments where she attempts to be funny or quirky, but comes across as kind of mean towards the boy in town. I don't know how to put my finger on it, but something about this movie didn't completely enthrall and engage me quite the way the top animated films I've ever seen have.\n\nOverall: This is a very good, just not great film. The animation and story are both damn good, it just never reaches the heights of the best animated features I've seen.",

            "content": "\"Coraline\" is a 100 minute 3D stop-motion, dark fantasy horror film released on February 5, 2009 and it is based on Neil Gaiman's novel, \"Coraline\". This film was directed and produced by Henry Selick and also produced by Claire Jennings, Bill Mechanic and Mary Sandell.\nThe movie was released on the US on February 6, 2009, making 16 million during the opening weekend and 124 million worldwide. This production gained a large number of awards like \"Annie Awards\", \"Academy Awards\" and a \"Golden Globe\" nomination.\t\nThe film is based on a girl who recently moved to a new house in Oregon. Coraline has typical family problems where parents are too occupied for their children, and that makes her sad, lonely and frustrated. By feeling this way, she starts exploring her new house trying to find something fun in addition to her neighbors. In all of this situation, Caroline is being watched  by an evil and hungry witch by means of a doll that looks exactly like Caroline but with button eyes.\n As the movie goes on, she finds a mysterious key and starts visiting a \"perfect\" parallel world in her \"dreams\", where everything is what she has always wanted. But there were some sort of things that were very strange and dark in this new world, so she starts questioning things. When she finally got some answers from three dead kids, she starts to plan her scape doing everything she can  and turning into a menace to the witch. In order to get rid of that world she needs to pass a lot of tests and hard work, because if not, she would be stuck in it forever and the evil witch will feed on her for the rest of her life. At this point she understand how much her real family means to her despite every problem and that she would give her all to get her parents back. This motivation gives Coraline a touch of strength, and with the help of some friends she starts this horrendous adventure. \nThe footage in this movie is amazing. It takes the stop-motion to whole new level, using 3D printers and having different parts of just one character body to make everything more realistic. The film involved 450 people to help with the project, including all types of professionals. Another thing that makes the movie environment is the stunning music performed by Michele Marina, John Linnel, Kent Melton and Bruno Coulais.\nIn my personal opinion this is a tremendous movie not only because the spectacular footage but because of the amazing lesson and its way to show it. One of them is the reality that we are living now days, were parents don't have enough time for their kids because they have other priorities, causing a worrisome impact on kids, and leading them to a rebel status or to do dangerous things without their parents noticing because they aren't present. But also it let the kids to understand that their parents do love them despite they are always present or not and try to understand that they are working for the future of the family. Another moral the movie shares, is the importance of valuing the things we already have and to love our family the way it is. To not get blinded by material things, because at the end it is what it is, material. \nIt is a story where all kind of audience can get identified and it attracts a lot of people of different ages. Even though it looks like a children movie it isn't that innocent or sane as it looks. The movie could be a little traumatic for some kind of minor audience because it has very impacting scenes. This quality is a very distinctive one, because usually cartoon movies or this types of films where there are no actors, can lead us to automatically think that this is just another kids movie, which can be a good and a bad thing. A good one because the adult audience can get interested in the film and they can talk about it to others and gain viewers. And a bad thing because parents can take their little kids to watch it, thinking it won't scare them. Of course everybody reacts different and there are kids who totally love the film. \nThe end of the movie can make us feel that a sequel can come out of it. The film let to our imagination what finally happened with certain things that were obviously unconcluded. They can make a second movie and it would have a lot of success if it come like the first one or even  better. But of course, the making of a movie like that isn't totally easy and it takes years to complete it, so lets hope for a sequel in an near future.",

She eneters it and sees that her mother is there and so is her father but something is off about them her father suddenly learned to play the piano and is no longer busy with work and her mother is making her favourite food and being the nicest person to her.

            "content": "Since the Brothers Grimm penned their morbid fairy tales (and probably before), children and adults have escaped into fantasy to safely explore the dangers of reality. Tales such as Hansel and Gretel, and in the last century The Wizard of Oz, have provided imaginative worlds with dangers at every turn. The purpose of such tales was always to warn, educate, and provide a backdrop for moral instruction.\n\nSuch is true of Coraline, a cinematic fairy tale crafted by writer Neil Gaiman and director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas). Based on a book by Gaiman, this visually astounding stop-motion masterpiece is a reminder that not all fairy tales have wistful princesses and happy musical numbers (sorry, Disney). This is a return to the creepy morality tales of yore, and while young children may have nightmares from the unsettling mood and tone, older children and adults will likely delight in both its imagination and its message.\n\nCoraline's title character is a plucky and resilient child (expertly voiced by Dakota Fanning) who has moved to a dusty, lonely old house in Washington with her parents. Both are neglectful in their own way: her father is caring enough, but is constantly aloof, while her mother (voiced by Teri Hatcher) is so busy that she hardly notices her daughter, and is often annoyed by her when she does.\n\nOne night, Coraline discovers a portal into a parallel existence: same house, same parents, but here everything is exactly as she wishes it were in reality. The dreariness of her true home is replaced by vibrant colors and spectacle. Her neglectful parents are replaced by updated versions who live only to lavish her with affection and wish-fulfillment. Soon Coraline begins to greatly prefer the alternate life to her actual one. It's all seems perfect, but she (and the audience) cannot shake the unsettling suspicion that something isn't quite right. Only a sage old black cat (who is realistically silent in the \"real world,\" but suavely vocal in other) seems to understand the dangers behind the seductive facade of Coraline's dream world.\n\nTo say more would be to ruin the surprises, but suffice to say that the film contains excellent messages for those who look for discussion points to share with their children afterward. The dream world serves as a perfect metaphor for the cunningly disguised lies of harmful people, as well their tactics of using subtle counterfeits to grant people's wishes in the short run, while slowly entangling (and later chaining) them in the long run.\n\nAs my mother always said: \"If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\" With regards to Coraline's dream parents, they may be seen as a practical warning against slick strangers who might lure children away by promising them exactly what they want (much like the \"candy man\" character in Chitty Chitty Bang-Bang). The black cat, whose warnings initially go unheeded, may be seen to serve a similar purpose to parents, friends, and teachers. He is a wise, caring character who sees and understands things that the protagonist does not yet comprehend, tries to keep her from harm, and helps her when she is in peril.\n\nFurthermore, the film not only reminds parents of the need to give their children attention and affection, but also helps children understand the stresses of parenting and the need for gratitude for the parents they do have.\n\nIn addition to serving as a lasting morality tale, Coraline is a terrific artistic achievement. While computer-generated animation is en vogue at the moment, the terrific and nearly seamless stop-motion animation here is something different and gorgeous to behold. The film is currently showing both in 3D and as a regular feature; I recommend that you see it in 3D if possible, as the richly designed sets and characters were meant to be experienced in that format. Far from a mere gimmick, the 3D in this case actually brings more life to the story, revealing layers and depth that were actually created by hand and filmed, one meticulous frame at a time.\n\nParents should be warned, that while the film contains no real violence, it is full of unsettling images and a creepy atmosphere that will doubtless give nightmares to little ones (much like the wicked witch from The Wizard of Oz, though this is a good deal scarier). There is mild profanity. A scantily-dressed and buxom elderly woman, though a clay-animated figure and far from titillating, may be offensive to some. That said, for older kids, teens, and adults who possess rich imaginations and an appreciation for this type of film, Coraline is a terrific night at the movies, and worth the added fee to view in 3D.",

The voice work was all top notch, I really liked each character and I loved how different and strange they all were. Coraline also features maybe the best villain I've ever seen in a stop motion film, and maybe even a kids film with The Other Mother, hands down one of the creepiest characters I've seen. It almost qualifies as a horror film, kids would definitely be frightened by everything happening to the main character and the weird imagery on screen. I definitely found it unnerving at times, but I wouldn't say scary, just really unsettling for a kids movie. Coraline is something unlike I've ever seen, and doubt I'll see again",

As a result I can't figure out why Coraline even goes on the journey, what she learns that is useful information in the real world, and how she then applies that learning to the real world. \n\nI want to go back in time and retroactively get up in a huff and leave the movie theater every time she calls Whybe \"Why be born\" -- what a little bitch! (and to the writers, did you think we weren't going to get his character's self-importance struggles from his name being \"Whybe\" so you had to make Coraline call him that every time?) \n\nI mean, movies are about life, for the most part... and when they aren't about life (or are too focused on the experience of only a few weird individuals) in some way, they're usually pretty much ignored, or just really bad and boring. \n\nSo, I find it difficult to find any redeeming qualities of the character Coraline, and I feel really bad about that for some reason.

He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.\n\nI definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore). Ones so well-written would truly be 'comic book movies' worth watching for me.",

It makes the whole thing feel more intimate and especially for an animated film with such a striking design, it feels grounded. The score is equally minimal, but beautiful whenever present.\n\nThe story doesn't land the visceral punch of \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" but Henry Selick is nevertheless the perfect fit for Neil Gaiman's blend of childhood wonder and magical realism.

This is nightmare fodder for children, however brave, under a certain age. I know kids are exposed to all sorts of horror films via video, but \"Coraline\" is disturbing not for gory images but for the story it tells. That's rare in itself: Lots of movies are good at severing limbs, but few at telling tales that can grab us down inside where it's dark and scary.\n\nEven more rare is that Coraline Jones is not a nice little girl. She's unpleasant, complains, has an attitude and makes friends reluctantly. Nor does she meet sweet and colorful new pals in her adventure, which involves the substitution of her parents by ominous doubles with buttons sewn over their eyes. She is threatened with being trapped in their alternate world, which is reached by an alarming tunnel behind a painted-over doorway in her own.\n\nNot that Coraline's own parents are all that great. They're busy, distracted, bickering and always hunched over their computers. They hardly hear her when she talks. That's why she recklessly enters the tunnel and finds her Other Mother and Other Father waiting with roast chicken and a forced cheerfulness. All she needs to stay there is to have buttons sewn into her own eye sockets. \n\nThe Other Mother and Father essentially want to steal Coraline from her real but distracted parents and turn her into some kind of a Stepford daughter. \n\nI admire the film mostly because it is good to look at. Credit is due to those who backed this film. I'm tired of wall-to-wall cuteness like \"Kung Fu Panda,\" and wonder if Selick's approach would be suited to films for grown-ups adapted from material like stories by August Derleth or Stephen King.\n\nAnd perhaps I didn't make it clear that it's fine with me that Coraline is an unpleasant little girl. It would be cruelty to send Pippi Longstocking down that tunnel, but Coraline deserves it. Maybe she'll learn a lesson.",

            "content": "When it comes to animated films, they usually are sweet family oriented fables but every once in a while an animated feature that's actually more than that appears; like the orchestral musical \"Fantasia\", the heavy on dark themes \"Hunchback of Notre Dame\" or the horror film \"Coraline\". \nCoraline Jones is a teenager who moves from Michigan to Oregon with her parents. When she is exploring her new home she discovers a secret tunnel that leads her to another reality where everything is magical, but Coraline will soon discover that not everything is what it seems to be. \nWith Henry Selick (the man that was truly the one responsible for the beloved \"The Nightmare Before Christmas) at the helm of this stop motion animated film, my expectations were high and thankfully Selick didn't disappoint. \"Coraline\" has gorgeous stop motion animation (which is incredible for a new studio to make this high quality animation), a story that feels like \"Alice in Wonderland\" meets Edgar Allan Poe (to the point of combining Cheshire with Poe\u00b4s Black Cat), a mesmerizing world that will impress you with its creativity throughout the film\u00b4s running time, the pacing goes from a wonder/whimsical feel to a full on horror vibe, the voice acting is solid, some of the imagery is absolutely unforgettable, the songs aren't exactly memorable but they are creepy (exactly what they needed to be), the character designs are great even though the characters are nothing more than stereotypes, a fantastic/creepy villainess that will definitely scare children under 10, a well-made creepy Halloween atmosphere, a protagonist that isn't an annoyingly whiny girl neither a goody two shoes heroine, the character development is predictable but it works within this film, a beautiful message, and it has a more than appropriate running time. My big issue with the film is that the fantastic world works so perfectly that you almost forget about the reality setting as it never has a memorable scene and it's an element that comes and goes because it only is here as setup for the fantasy realm of the film (Kind of what happened in \"Inside Out\", you spend so much time in the creatively beautiful setup that when you return to the real world of the film it comes off as a wasted opportunity of making a memorable setup like Guillermo Del Toro did in \"Pan\u00b4s Labyrinth\").\n\"Coraline\" is a beautiful animated film that has the wonder feel of \"Nightmare\" plus a horror vibe. It is definitely a perfect horror movie for children (it will give them nightmares to kids that are under the age of 10) and one of the best -if not the best- stop motion animated feature films ever made (Tim Burton needs to learn a few things from this film)",

Coraline's character as a headstrong, tomboyish girl with her acute sense of curiosity and adventurousness carries the movie forward, it was such a joy to watch her throughout the whole story. While the story is a familiar 'child finds secret door and hidden world behind it', it is hard to argue about how well composed it was. Coraline's quest to find the missing eyes and her parents was enthralling on its own, arguably akin to playing a great adventure role playing game. Thoroughly enjoyable, Coraline represents how a great story can be made into a impeccable movie even with relatively low budgets. Highly recommended for kids, adults who are kids inside, and adults too!",

I must say though, this film has had to grow on me because, whilst never scared of it, I initially found it boring. How wrong I was. The visuals are so colourful and breathtaking, its almost visually cinematic. I do, a little, think the protagonist was a little whingey but it makes the story far more compelling. And whilst many would argue this is too dark for young children, thats precisely the reason you should go see it. Children need to be scared, its part of growing and learning.  And the button-eyed people are the perfect creatures to do so. This film is not violent. Its not dark in terms of its visuals, like the nightmare before Christmas.  It doesn't kill of characters like the lion king or finding nemo. It does something almost unheard of. It haunts children psychologically. And does it fantastically",

            "content": "Name of movie: Coraline\nDirector: Henry Selick \nGenre: Animation/Fantasy\nRating: 3.5 Stars\n\nIntro: This film is for an audience of thrill seeking movie watchers. The movie looks as if it was made by Tim Berton but with a little uniqueness \nslipped in. The story is very intriguing the whole time and never looses you. This movie is all about the adventures of Coraline a girl who moves into a \nmysterious house that holds many secrets. I would advise parents that this movie has scenes that could be scary to kids that are under the age of \nseven.\n\nSummary of the Movie.:\nThe movie Coraline is a story about a young girl that moves to an old house called \"The Pink Palace\" and finds a secret that is centuries long. After \nmoving away from her home in Michigan she starts to feel alone. She feels that her parents don't care about her so she looks for some entertainment. \nShe finds a small door that has been locked and bricked up. But during the night she is drawn to the small door to see that it connects to an other \nworld. This world has everything she wanted to be in her past life. But her parents and everything she has ever known has a twist on it because they \nall have button eyes. After a wile of seeing how amazing this \"other world\" is she gets obsessed. Until her \"other mother\" wishes for her to stay there \nforever but Coraline refuses and tries to leave. With no luck she has to trick her \"other mother\" to letting her go back to her old life. \n\nTheme: The theme of Coraline is to be carful what you wish for. This movie teaches you that you should love what you have and never wish to \nchange your family. Henry was trying to connect to kids that want another mother or sister or brother to make there life \"better\".\n\nTechnical Elements: The movie Coraline is all claymation. Some parts may look animated but it is claymation. In other words it is stop motion which \nmeans it's a bunch of pictures taken every time a clay prop moves the slightest. Then if it is played back it makes motion.\n\nConclusion: Over all Coraline is a really good movie but can be scary to young viewers. I would certainly recommend this to a family that wants to \nhave a movie night. Coraline is an amazing movie and takes you on an journey through your wildest imaginations. Henry based this movie on a book \nwritten by Neil Gaimen, the two stories are basically the same story but with a little twist on the movie. Clearly this movie is a must watch for any \nfamily and is a movie you will never forget.\n\n-WV, 8th Grade Student",

            "content": "Good scary kids animation movie starring Dakota fanning. I was surprised of the rating this movie was given, in my opinion this movie is scary and the sexual content of the one white haired actress in the other button eyed world and what she was wearing , nothing just glitter to cover the you know what. Besides that the crazy idea of a girl who wants to spend more time with her parents and so her father tells her to explore the house, she does so and finds a secret door to another button eyed world. I like the idea of that and I like how this movie shows kids that your life could be much worse but for me if I was in coraline s place I would just punch the button eyed mom because buttons are creepy, just creepy but some kids would love that, the food, the everything except they'll probably last as long as the button eyed people don't ask to put the buttons on then the kids will stay but when they ask they're out of their as fast as possible. The art style or animation of this movie is phenomenal, it feels like a tim Burton film but nope it's not, no Johnny depp but I like the clay mation and all those hours , months put in really make me appreciate this film. When I saw this movie in theaters long time ago, I was a lot younger and actually had nightmares of this film but now that I've seen it for a second time, I'm no longer scared of the buttons.",

It is also one of the few American animated features that does not try to be a comedy. Think about that. That's how one dimensional we are when it comes to animation.

After watching Aladdin, the bus started to get more quiet, and we didn't watch anything else for now. So I ended up watching the downloaded films on Netflix, and just watched this first, which is a fantastic starter for Laika Studios. Dakota Fanning is great at being whiny and irritated at the same time, but it was never annoying, and she also gets better when the movie progresses. The clay-nation looks fantastic, and there were some moments that I honestly don't know how they did it. The characters are three-dimensional that when things get out of hand, you really start to root for Coraline and fear for her safety. It has a lot of creepy imagery, but it's never to the point that it'll be traumatic to kids, and it's cool to see something be pleasant, and be not so pleasant. The pacing really starts to pick up when the beginning is slow, but it still keeps you interested in what's going on. There are some humor that's really good that it doesn't really become too depressing to watch. The writing and direction by Henry Selick really seem to understand about what the kid is going through when they have to move to a different place, and just have to deal with it a different way from what the parents are going through. In the end, Coraline is an amazing film that i wish that more people could go see the films that Laika Studios has made.",

            "content": "For the most part, this visually stunning, stop-motion film was fun, imaginative, and entertaining, but there were some glaring issues with it that I couldn't stand.\n\nThe tropes. My god, there are so many tropes. It's a walking stereotype. This isn't to say that the movie is bad-- it isn't. It's a good movie. But when a trope hits, you know it is one, and you know exactly how it's going to play out from the beginning. For example, the sort of heavy-handed \"fetch quest\" revolving around the eyes of the ghost children. That whole thing felt so sappy and pointless.\n\nCoraline's parents. For the entire first half of the film, they're awful and negligent. Then they toss in some emotionally-manipulating scene where Coraline's mother tries to act nice out of completely nowhere, leaving me baffled at the lack of continuity in the character. It was put in for the sole purpose of making you feel like Coraline would still be \"better off\" with her real family than in the other dimension.\n\nThe villain. I felt SORRY for her. I felt even more sorry for the villain than I did Coraline's parents. It's obvious they tried as hard as ever to make her \"evil\" (again, see sappy ghost children above), but they tried to get that across by simultaneously making her out to be this lonely individual that needed love so bad that she'd stop at nothing to get it. Sure, she didn't understand what love was, but she knew she wanted it. That seemed... really, really sad to me. Maybe it was meant to be this way, but I highly doubt it.\n\nThe exposition, Deus Ex Machina cat. Don't need to elaborate on that.\n\nI know I'm making it sound like I think the movie's awful. I don't. It was very imaginative, creative, and immersive, but unfortunately, very safe and predictable. While being enchanted by the visuals, acting, and story, I did find that it used way, WAY too many cliches. I've never read the book, so I don't know who is meant to be blamed for that.\n\nOverall, good movie, and on its own, a little different, but don't expect anything TOO unique.",

She thought that it was the same as her world, but instead they had buttons for eyes and it was ten times better than her own world. Eventually she finds out the world is eval. So she try's to find away out. She left the eval mother, and went back home and relived that all she needed was right there in her own world. I thought this was an amazing movie to grow up with.",

A small door in the family's new dining room, in a large house shared with other tenants, leads to a magical alternate universe where everyone in Coraline's life has a duplicate, except they have buttons in their faces instead of eyes. In the other world, her parents listen to her and play with her and make wonderful food for her. It seems much nicer than the real world, but she soon discovers the wonders of the other world are lures to lead her into a trap.\n\nThe story is suitably bizarre, but it's the film's look that is astounding. Painstakingly animated using stop-motion techniques, the film's sets and models are spectacular. There is so much detail and such a unique visual style, your eyes are constantly roaming across the screen, soaking in all the little embellishments and doodads in the background. Although the story's momentum flags a bit when Coraline has to go on a treasure hunt to save herself, the sheer ingenuity on display is enough to keep you smiling until the end.",

He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.\n\nI definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore). Ones so well-written would truly be 'comic book movies' worth watching for me.",

            "content": "Let's start 13 Days of Halloween with Coraline!\n\nCoraline is a very atmospheric movie, it's atmospheric in its characters, its colors, its lighting and tone, and at times it's very noteworthy and likable in its own creativity. This is one of those films where I think that the stop-motion department was at its best, considering that Coraline was made by a new film company called Laika, who also did Paranorman, that's another review, but, let's take a look at what we have.\n\nWe have a busy family and their daughter Coraline Jones played by Dakota Fanning, their moving into a new dilapidated-apartment building and Coraline is simply bored because her parents are always busy and never have any time to spend with her. However, that all changes when she finds a door leading to a special world one night, in fact, it's her home simply reversed. There she encounters her \"Other Mother\", her mother simply with buttons for eyes. There she has the time of her life, she has great food, she's entertained but most importantly she feels like where she belongs and the more she visits the more she wants to stay. Or does she? It isn't until she realizes that the world that she's visiting isn't all hunky-dory and she realizes that she needs to escape the clutches of the Other Mother in order for her, and presumably her family, to be set free...\n\nLet's talk at what we have here. First off, you have to take the fact that this was made by a new company called Laika who just started fresh and new. Laika, owned by the Nike philanthropist Phil Knight who doesn't seem to be the best person to give to a film company especially seeing what he does. But, it keeps the studio opened so I can't really complain.\n\nCoraline tone color goes between warm and cold, warm and cold. And you know what, that actually makes sense since the film takes place in Oregon and I've been there before, well, Washington actually. But it's still cool nonetheless, and this film has its tone down pretty perfectly. When a characters in a house, you imagine it being warm, or when a character outside, you literally felt like it was cold. Stuff like the tone is great and I hope that Laika continues to do the same thing with its films.\n\nThe characters are very memorable. You have two old actresses that argue, you have an old man who's interested in the mice circus and is also very flexible. You have another character who gets involved who is actually very comedic. Heck, even her parents, and \"other\" parents do a pretty good job conveying emotion into their roles, as if you literally felt like this movie was being watched in real life, not in stop-motion. I felt that all the characters were real, I felt like the creepy imagery was real.  Oh, speaking of, at the start of the next half of the movie the imagery and the colors get dark slowly but surely and the atmosphere literally takes it time building up with the characters and their speed and pacing. And, I'm sorry, but that has to be one of the most ideal atmospheric stuff that you can put in a movie, making it good for the kids because they wanna see what happen and making it suspenseful, and good for the adults who want to see the imagery and colors of both worlds. And to be honest, I find movies like that fascinating. They give more for the kids and just enough for adults, and I have to say Neil Gaiman should be proud for writing the book and Henry Selick for trying their best (especially at the start of their own career) to make a movie so magical and so colorful...\n\nAre there problems? None that I can find, unless you simply don't like the movie for whatever reason. The characters are likable; they're nice to listen to. I couldn't find any problems, but, I really enjoyed the movie, its heartwarming, its beautiful, its colorful, it's memorable. It's an all-around good movie well deserving of the high score and as I said before, I really enjoyed it. \n\nCoraline - Atmospheric lighting, characters-in-life...",

            "content": "I can hardly think of a single negative thing to say about Coraline. After enjoying ParaNorman and after a recommendation from a friend, I eagerly viewed Coraline. The movie has a great track-record with critics and intelligent people alike; and it is just as good, if not better than its reputation. So why only give it 70%? I really don't have a solid answer for that question. \r\n\r\nInquisitive Coraline Jones and her family move into a run-down apartment house called the Pink Palace. Coraline's family is boring. Her life is boring. Her neighbors are eccentric and hard to connect with. And her new house is ... boring. That is, until she discovers a secret door. What during the day is a simple blocked off tunnel, becomes a magical portal to another dimension at night! And in this other dimension, her family is bubbly, her life is vivacious, her neighbors are delightful, and her house is exciting! But all that glitters is not gold, a proverb that Coraline is forced to learn the hard way.\r\n\r\nThe story is very well put together, if a bit predictable. I never felt that Coraline was in any particular danger throughout the goings on. But that doesn't negate the entertaining narrative. There isn't much humor in the script, but it's not really a serious movie either. As the story flows along, the visuals get more and more stunning. That is one of the main things I love about the plot, it provides for wonderful eye-candy!\r\n\r\nAnd what delicious eye-candy it is! The visuals pop from start to finish. At the beginning, the movie has a very drab feel - to reflect how dreary Coraline's life is. Once we move into the alternate reality, we are treated to some more bright colors and flamboyant situations. But when the alternate reality turns sour, we get a haunted, gothic feel. It's all beautifully animated in the flawlessly done stop-motion. As I said in my ParaNorman review, stop-motion is a largely ignored sub-genre, but it definitely shouldn't be. \r\n\r\nDakota Fanning gives a spunky performance as Coraline. The character is a fun one, but she never seems to truly get terrified. Any realistic person (no matter how old) would be thoroughly freaked out by the situation Coraline finds herself in. \r\n\r\nTeri Hatcher and Keith David are the only other stand-outs in the cast. Hatcher plays Coraline's mother, and the fiendish \"Other Mother.\" While normal mother is generic and unsurprising, Other Mother is quite the opposite! It's pretty cool when the character gets all ghoulish and disgusting! Keith David plays the astute feline. It's a very fun character, and David gives him a strong voice to match.\r\n\r\nNot to echo what I said about ParaNorman, but once again we have another example of a kids' movie that is completely inappropriate for children. I was expecting it more this time around, so it didn't affect me as much. Still, it's an issue that bugs me a little. But in this case, it doesn't lower the score.\r\n\r\nThe slip-up the filmmakers make isn't really their fault. It lies in the source material. To condense the movie, it basically goes like this (spoilers): Coraline is disappointed with her life. She doesn't particularly care for her parents. She finds a portal to another dimension. Everything is fine and dandy on the other side, making her real life seem even worse. She travels over to the fake world and realizes that it's actually a really twisted and terrible place. After much trial, she finally makes it back to the real world (spoilers over). Supposedly, through her experience, she learns that \"the grass isn't always greener on the other side.\" But does she really? If the options are a normal life, or a sadistic witch who eats your soul, I think most everybody would choose a normal life. So if the other world was better than her real one, would Coraline have stayed there - forsaking her real family? Yes, she learns to appreciate her family, but compared to her other option; did she really learn her lesson? I think not.\r\n\r\nOn a whole, Coraline is a very well made movie. It's enjoyable for its animation and wonderful visuals. But it just simply is not my kind of movie. The Tim Burton style of filmmaking has never really appealed to me, but this movie is an exception. Not my favorite kind of movie, but one I appreciate for what it is.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Coraline Jones. I've got so much to tell you.\" 7/10",

            "content": "\"EVIL WITCH, I'M NOT SCARED!\"\r\n\r\nStop-motion animation is something that I strongly support. Looking into the hard, heavy detail of the models and the visuals, and with Hollywood's push towards CGI, it looks like Claymation is in a state of decline. Sure there's been some hits like The Nightmare Before Christmas, Chicken Run, Wallace and Gromit, and Corpse Bride, but on top of that,  there's other that, while critically acclaimed, were massive flops, such as Fantastic Mr. Fox, Frankenweenie, and The Pirates: Band of Misfits. But there's one independent studio that just doesn't give up, and that's a small studio called Laika. With the upcoming release of The Boxtrolls and two modest successes on their hands, it looks like Laika is appealing Claymation to a new generation. While I'm definitely excited about a film about boxtrolls, it was about time that I gave watch to Laika's other films, so naturally, I started with the first, Coraline, which is based on a children's book by Neil Gaiman and directed by Henry Selick, also known for The Nightmare Before Christmas (my all-time favorite stop-motion film) and James and the Giant Peach. And I'm glad I finally decided to give Coraline a watch, as the film is visually imaginative, dark, and sometimes terrifying, and I highly enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nHaving been relocated to an old home in Oregon called The Pink Palace (which has been turned into renovated apartments), eleven-year-old Coraline Jones is bored with her life. Her parents are always busy with their work and seem to ignore her in every minute, the house is boring as what a usual old house is, she's constantly annoyed by a local \"stalker\" boy, and her neighbors seem to act a little odd for her liking. But Coraline finds some interesting things to talk about when she discovers a secret door, which leads her into an alternate reality of her life, with extremely loving parents, fun and games, and even things that are highly impossible in the real world, such as a talking cat, but the more time Coraline spends in her alternate world, she realizes that things aren't what they seem, especially when the Other Mother, who has buttons on her eyes, demands that buttons should be placed on Coraline's eyes.\r\n\r\nAs the film was progressing in my mind, I kept thinking that Tim Burton could have made this movie, as the dark, eerie visuals is something that Burton masters in. While Burton was not involved in making this film, clearly the film does have that cool Tim Burton vibe, and it works, brilliantly. What fascinates me most about the film is how the style of the visuals change on how tense the situations get, especially in the alternate reality moments, where the colors pop when everything's happy, and extremely spooky when it's just a terrifying nightmare. Claymation was perfect for Coraline, as I wouldn't have pictured a film this dark in anything CGI. \r\n\r\nThe voice casting in Coraline in fantastic. We have Dakota Fanning who voices the title character, and she nails it. I loved that Fanning was able to convey an 11-year old girl with an adventure side, and when things are extremely nightmarish that would have creeped me out in a heartbeat, she knew how to overcome it without being scared. Simply put, Coraline Jones is an excellent role model for any child who is scared of anything related to anything dark and spooky, possibly one of the best female role models in a modern animated film, up there with Mulan, Rapunzel, and Anna from Frozen. The other fantastic, standout performance is Teri Hatcher as both mothers. And like Fanning, Hatcher voices her role fantastically, particularly the Other Mother. The obsessive behavior of this supposedly nice but terrifyingly freaky character is brilliantly portrayed, reminding me a little bit of Judith Anderson's creepy performance in Hitchcock's Rebecca. There's also John Hodgman as the father, who's role is delightfully fun, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders as two retired British actresses, who also delight in oddness, and Ian McShane as the weird Mr. Bobinsky, and is also fun.\r\n\r\nThe film is scored by French composer Bruno Coulais, a composer that I had never heard of before watching Coraline, and like what Danny Elfman would do in a Tim Burton film, Coulais delights in sounds of brilliant creepiness and strong instrumentations. Would like to see him score more mainstream animation films, particularly those that are claymated, if more films are made of course. \r\n\r\nWhen I watch an animated film, I'd like for it to appeal to its target audience, mainly children, and while I was very impressed with Coraline, I don't think the film is that appropriate for the youngest of children. There are things in Coraline that very much pushes the limits of its PG rating, such as crude sexual jokes, obsessive behavior that would very much confuse children, the creepy visuals, and a very wrong Burlesque scene featuring the odd British actresses, one wearing an outfit that a stripper would wear, and one that's shown in front of kids. I know there's animators that like to sneak adult humor in so-called kids films, and most of the time, I'm OK with it, particularly in DreamWorks films, but it was a little over the top in Coraline. Plus the dark content would likely scar a two-year-old for life. This wouldn't be a film I would show to my children, if I ever have children of course, until teen years. I'm surprised that the film did not get a PG-13 rating for the Burlesque scene alone! Oh well, at least I had some enjoyment out of it and I would show this to older children over Mars Needs Moms, which in my book, will scar everyone for life.\r\n\r\nThe film isn't 100% family-friendly as what to expect in animation (or Claymation in that matter), but for those that can handle the dark, edgy content (like over the age of 16), Coraline is visually wonderful, dark, and filled with grand imagination. With this and The Nightmare Before Christmas, Henry Selick, along with Tim Burton, is a visual genius in stop motion and if both continue to make claymated films, along with the Laika studio, then maybe, just maybe, stop motion might get the attention that it truly deserves. As for now, I'm excited about seeing The Boxtrolls later in the year and have higher hopes on Laika's other feature that I have yet to see, ParaNorman.",

Caroline Jones finds her life boring and thinks that her parents do not care for her one bit. She meets Wybie and rather sinister-looking black cat, and receives a rather strange doll which resembles her. Soon, she is led through a small doorway into another world, which is almost like her own home, but livelier. It is a place where her parents are fun - only with buttons as eyes - and she can do her favourite things all day until she goes to sleep. The next morning, she would wake up back in her real home again. Attracted by the place, she makes another trip back there, but soon discovers that things there are a little too good to be true. Only when it is too late does she realise her terrible mistake. \n\nThis is the first animated feature I have watched in quite a while now and it is indeed refreshing, especially seeing as it incorporates fantasy, horror and Gothic elements - some of my favourite genres. Based on the Hugo-winning novella by author Neil Gaiman, this film adaptation went on to win several awards at the Annie Awards and was nominated at both the Oscars and Golden Globes for best animated feature. \n\nOn the main aspects, the voice acting is pretty good. Dakota Fanning's voice is perfect for Coraline and Keith David (Crash, Requiem for a Dream) as the cat is bone-chilling. Apart from that, I was pleasantly surprised to hear British comedy legends, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders voicing two former burlesque dancers leaving under Coraline's house. The screenplay is well-written and the overall pacing of the film is perfect. \n\nOn the technical aspects, the production design is both gorgeous and harrowing at the same time. While the designs resemble those of Night Before Christmas and Corpse Bride, it contains some of its own elements. The stop-motion animation is also pretty good and it actually makes the villain all the more scary. The music by Bruno Coulais is haunting, bone-chilling and out of this world. Simply beautiful. \n\n\nOverall, this is a beautifully dark and haunting animated feature with an important message to children - be careful for what you wish for. The wish might just end up devouring you, instead.",

The animation is beautiful, artistic and without a doubt some of the best stop-motion animation I have ever seen. Oh and it`s not just the animation, it also has a thrilling and imaginitive narrative similar to Alice in wonderland but more twisted and I love it. The characters are likable, the soundtrack is great and compliments the animation and tone, the script is fantastic. It has a perfect pace, atleast I noticed it alot with how it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and excited to see what would happen next. In my opinion I find this film superior to Alice in Wonderland both the Burton and Disney version. This was for me an incredible suprise and managed to exceed my expectations which were high to say the least. Simply stunning.",

Although the protagonist's character has major development and improves at the end, she doesn't give me the impression of a likable character I wanted to root for upon introduction. Supporting characters were also bland to me. But besides those blemishes, Coraline is overall a colorful and entertaining film.",

            "content": "I got to see Neil Gaiman at George Mason University last fall as he read excerpts from his stories and told the story of why Coraline became a kid's book (it's actually quite funny). Seeing this brilliant man's work on the big screen is a great thing to see as he's both imaginative and an entertaining story teller. Coraline follows the story of young Coraline Jones, who has just moved from Michigan to Pink Palace Apartments. As she grows bored by the minute, she discovers a mysterious door. When she first opens it, it's just a brick wall. But, at night, she discovers a whole new world where everything seems to fit to her wants and desires. The only real difference between this world and the real world is that everyone seems to have buttons for eyes. It seems like a dream come true for her because they're all listening to her and she's getting everything she wants. That is, until she discovers that this world is in a very dark place. What I loved the most about Coraline is that it does something that not many kids films do nowadays. It actually has a dark and eerie story to it. Everything goes great until one scene in particular when Coraline learns what she needs to do in order to stay, which changes the tone of the story. I enjoyed every minute of the tonal shift because it came off as extremely creepy while also trying not to terrify littler children (but this should still probably be seen by kids a little over 8). There's dark subject material that feels like a breath of fresh air from other generic family films. The visual effects in this film look dynamite for a stop motion film. The way the visuals appear greatly reflect the mood of the story, making sure not to be inconsistent. The acting, for the most part, was pretty good. None of the child voices had me cringing and the adult actors do their part pretty well too. The only major quarrels I have with this film are the fact that some of the body language used doesn't match what they're saying and some of the lines are extremely cheesy and not very pleasant to hear. Other than that, Coraline is a very well made animated film that does a good job of steering away from the other clich\u00e9d family films by adding some darkness to the tale. It's well worth the time to see it and, though you might not be scared, you might leave the theater just a bit creeped out.",

            "content": "I don't know what else to say, but fantastic movie. So coraline is about a girl who has always dreamed of a better world where its more exciting and not boring, she just didn't think she would find it in her own home. She finds a door to another world where everything's better, it just couldn't be true. When her other mother asks her to stay there, coraline must escape while trying to save her real parents. So Why did I give this movie five stars? It's because this movie is so good. I will watch this movie over and over again. I guess the button eyes may creep younger kids out. This movie should be watched by at least 10 years old and up. I did laugh at times in this movie. It does have humor. One character in this movie, Mr. bobinsky kind of disgusts me because of the hair on his belly button. Also his mustache looks like pubic hair if anyone has noticed. This movie kind of scared me, but I've watched it so much that I've memorized every quote. Mr. Bobinsky really doesn't bother me that much its just kind of disgusting. There were two things in this film that could be fixed. One is the music. I looked up the music to this movie the people who sing the music just say random words. The second thing is I wished they explained who the two kids in the photo were. Overall it's a good movie. I'm still wondering y the movie, 9, was rated pg-13. The reason I bring up 9 is that this movie and that movie were both made by focus features. I don't know why that movie is pg-13 and coraline is pg. A person in this movie is almost nude in this movie. If anyone knows  why 9 is rated pg-13, or if u just have a question for me, email me at andreimarquart@gmail.com. Thats it. Ttyl",
