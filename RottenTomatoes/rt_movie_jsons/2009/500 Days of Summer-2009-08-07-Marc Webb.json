Joey Levitt is maybe the most underrated artist in Hollywood & this is a very good example of his brilliance. Almost every young man has lived through something similar to this life story. Other than the hokey korokke scenes every line, scene & casting choice are dead on perfect.",

            "content": "I think this has to be one of the most realistic romantic dramas I've seen in my entire life. Usually, every romantic drama ends with the couple getting back together or one of them dying, in some movies, it does make sense and in others it just feels like they did it just for the sake of shock/dramatic value. This film also does something similar, but the impact it leaves is just on another level. I won't spoil anything for you considering the story but I urge you to please watch this film as it teaches you an essential thing about life and about love.\n\nFirst off, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is just an amazing actor, he gives his all for the role of Tom Hansen, you feel for him and you desperately want him to get the girl of his dreams who he considers \"THE ONE\". Zooey Deschanel is also really good as Summer, she perfectly realizes her role as this mysterious girl who reveals things about herself only with people she's comfortable with.\n\nOne thing which I loved in particular about this film is the screenplay, he uses the intercut technique for this film with one event playing out in the future and then going back to the past to provide context for that particular event. It normally confuses the audience but here, it works wonders and conveys certain character emotions with a real impact.\n\nOne scene I just love in particular is the expectations/reality scene which was wholesome and equally heart-shattering at the same moment. It comes at a particular moment in the film where Tom has one last shred of hope left and it's taken away from him whilst changing the context entirely to an event that will happen in the future.\n\nOne thing which really bugs me about this film is that there is no context provided for Summer's side of the story, I understand that you want to make your audience resonate with Tom's side of the story but I really want to know what really prompted Summer to do certain things which she does or why she does it. If I had context for Summer's side of the story, I think the film would've managed to make an even larger impact.\n\nOverall, definitely recommended (especially for that extremely brief Harrison Ford cameo).",

            "content": "Not a normal love story, the film offers a novel perspective on the romantic comedy genre since it deviates from the standard storyline of a male meeting a lady, they become romantically involved, confront a challenge, and then getting married. Instead, the movie focuses on the difficulties and reality of relationships, emphasizing how they can be both compassionate and devastating.\n\nOutstanding performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom, a hopeless romantic who becomes deeply infatuated with Summer, a person who refuses to have any faith in romance. He captures the spirit of Tom's struggle as he strives to align his ambitions of the relationship with gratitude and complexity. The viewers commiserate with the character's sensitivity as they support him while having to confront the hard truths of his circumstance. The person to whom Tom is attracted, Summer, is played magnificently by Zooey Deschanel. Her persona is mysterious, intriguing, and complicated as she sorts through her own beliefs about love and relationships. The film's non-linear narrative, which swings between various periods of Tom and Summer's engagement, serves as one of the movie's finest components. By illustrating how the individuals' emotions and interactions shift as time passes, this framework gives the narrative richness. The audience rarely knows for sure where the plot will continue, which appeals to the sensation of unpredictability.\n\nThe movie's usage of the soundtrack seems to be another outstanding aspect. Incredible compositions from artists like The Smiths and Regina Spektor are included in the background, which flawlessly captures the vibe and flow of the narrative. The audio provides the film with an additional emotional context that strengthens the audience's attachment to the characters and their path. The concept for the movie is superb and sophisticated, it generally avoids the usual clich\u00e9s and rather concentrates on examining the intricacy of interpersonal connections and human traits. The people's conversations are compelling and sincere, reflecting the positive and negative aspects of their connections in a manner that seems realistic.\n\nIts candor on the obstacles of romantic partners is what makes the film so remarkable. The romance appears in the movie as something chaotic, spontaneous, and even torturous but nevertheless worthwhile to pursue. Even though it doesn't sugarcoat the reality of sorrow and regret, thus it acknowledges and embraces the enjoyment and solidarity that may emerge from experiencing love for the first time. With Summer's personality trying to defy the stereotype of the female companion, the movie confronts sexual conventions and expectancies. Layered and multifaceted, her ambitions, desires, and insufficiencies are all represented by Summer which results in contrast with various other romantic movies.\n\nTo summarize, 500 Days of Summer is a stunning, comforting, and thought-provoking film that presents an entirely novel perspective on the romance genre. The non-linear plot, remarkable cast, and fabulous soundtracks offer this movie highly recommended to anyone who appreciates an unforgettable romantic story. It will have you giggle, shed a tear, and end up leaving you feeling excited more about how influenced love and interpersonal relationship can be, and it's definitely going to be recognized for many decades to come.",

The story plot revolves around Tom's girlfriend Summer breaking up with him suddenly and him getting over it to find his true passions in life, and then revolving back into the relationship cycle and meeting someone new. I loved this movie because it showed me that love can be found after many tries and, like Summer believed, it's okay to not be in a serious relationship. Tom went through all the stages of grief because, in his mind, he believed that Summer was the only one and planned an entire future with her, while in reality he was creating an image in his head that might or might not be fulfilled. Life can come at you fast, and you can't forget yourself in the process of meeting others. You should be the majority source of happiness for yourself and work on yourself for the purpose of being a better person, not impressing other people. The only guarantee in the world is your own life and death, but that isn't a bad thing, you as a person can surpass the goals you've set by a mile if you truly believe in your own determination and self-worth.",

            "content": "\"Misery. Sadness. Loss of faith. No reason to live. This is perfect for you!\"\n\n(500) Days of Summer delivers a twist on the traditional rom-com structure, though it's arguable whether or not the film even classifies as a rom-com with the structural alterations done to it. Completely told from the perspective of one of the two individuals, the film chronicles a collapsing relationship using a distinctive time-jumping mechanic but is more about Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tom than it is the relationship; even if the film ends on a somewhat whimsical note and has a fair number of jokes, it trends more towards a critique of Tom's behavior and a distinction between mindless affection and love than it does a pure rom-com. Tom is in love with the idea of Zooey Deschanel's Summer and their superficial similarities, not Summer herself. He's shown to be dismissive of her own desires with his consistent, one-sided pursuit of a relationship against her will, and by the end of the film there really isn't much to suggest Tom has learned anything at all; his new relationship is shown to be founded on the same 'we like the same thing!' principles and even his next love interest's name (Autumn) suggests that Tom is heading down a similar, repetitive pathway without evolving, peppy end credits music be damned. \n\nIt's not really a relationship movie as much as it's a movie about a guy in a relationship, dissecting a male point of view and all the pitfalls of his unhealthy dynamic - obsessiveness, self-deception, etc. Quite a bit darker than it appears on the surface, but plenty entertaining and neatly put together with its staggered chronology and side-by-side shots. (3/5)",

First, let me start by saying that I have never seen a movie done like this before. I loved the out of order countdown and contrast between Summer and Tom as the days changed. I also loved the little details (for example, the background of the numbers and how as it nears 500, it becomes dull and brown, whereas day 1, it is bright white). Great acting all around, some really great shots, and beautiful symmetry. Overall, an untraditional love story that leaves you broken, yet hopeful.",

Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are perfectly matched and have great chemistry. He gets the big comic meltdown and hysterical musical number, she brings the bittersweet touches. The dialogue is witty and always funny. Even as the story embraces romance movie clich\u00e9s, it flips them in clever ways. There's droll narration and lovely cartoon effects to go with the sentimental moments and painful longing. It all adds up to an intoxicating romance that, even if it may not quite reach the realms of greatness, is certainly a nice change of pace from the crude/raunchy romantic comedies coming out of Judd Apatow's movie factory.

The non-linear format throughout the movie also didn't seem to serve the narrative in any way (other than starting with the breakup and then going to the beginning).  \n\nGordon-Levitt(Tom) was hitting his prime here so no complaints on his acting, and despite her later rep as playing the stereotypical Manic Pixie Dream Girl I thought Deschanel(Summer) was actually pretty subdued in the movie; for me it worked showing how Tom was projecting his idea on what he wanted Summer to be.\n\nOther than those points I found it middling and vastly overrated compared to a movie like Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist which just came out a year before and had better chemistry between the leads, a better soundtrack, and a much better use of the setting.",

The characters and storyline do not depict a perfect, fairy tale romance, but rather a much more realistic perspective of relationships. I think the purpose of the movie and characters can be easily misunderstood by audiences. The main characters have a good level of complexity and depth which is what creates such an intriguing story. The film really illustrates the contrast between expectation versus reality. While nothing quite dramatic occurs in the plot of the film, something kept me watching until the end, and brings me back to watch again and again. 500 Days of Summer is one of those movies you can watch repeatedly and find something new every time.

(500) Days of Summer is such a unique film because it's not like the regular sappy, unrealistic romance films that we all see today, this film tells a realistic portrayal of a relationship. The movie doesn't lie to the audience about what love is like the hollywood style rom-coms and it even references that in a scene where Joseph Gordon-Levitt is talking about how movies and music are to blame for the lies about love, this movie shows how a relationship builds up and how it breaks down. This is also a movie that is very self aware and doesn't take itself too seriously as a romance film which is why the romance and comedy work so well together. This film is absolutely hilarious, it knows when and when to implement humour correctly and when to implement drama correctly. The screenwriting for this film is brilliant and the directing is great, when scenes in the film show how happy Tom is, you just can't help to smile as well. The performances in this film are great, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are both excellent in their roles. Joseph Gordon-Levitt in my opinion is such an underrated actor and he is great in this role, along with his other movies like 50/50. The storytelling in general was flawless and unique unlike the modern day clique type romance films because this film has its own style as it uses a non-linear narrative structure of telling the story as it might show day 35 in one scene then in the next scene it might go to day 290. It's such an original film and I love it. Overall this movie is great and it's definitely my favourite rom-com. 5/5 stars",

The cast, Summer is well done and she plays her role to a tee, Tom's sister is fun, and adds some humor and personality to Tom. Through all of this the absolute star of this film is the one and only Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

For people who say this film is too fluffy and adorable, didn't you notice how from the beginning, we already know the relationship is going to fall apart?

The flavor of sadness and anger and confusion because it's hard to figure out how things that seemed so real were actually insincere or shallow or fleeting. I've been both characters at different times and i think this movie really captures a lot of subjective truth. The worst parts of the film were Tom's insanely fancy apartment for his greeting card writer's budget? And I wish we could have a mirrored story showing Summer's side of the story.

The stars of the movie Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt, show the struggles of love in the 21st century. The portrayal of lost and gained feelings gives insight to how often we in real life face challenges with love.\n\tThroughout the movie the characters Summer Finn and Tom Hansen are in constant uncertainty with their love for one another. Tom is a hopeless romantic and a firm believer in love at first sight, he feels this instantly when he meets Summer. However Summer thinks otherwise, she informs Tom that there is no such thing as love and that it is a fantasy. Nonetheless Tom continues to pursue Summer and falls even deeper in love as they go into a dating phase. What Tom doesn't realize is that Summer doesn't love him the way he loves her and she communicates to him multiple times that they are just friends. Tom doesn't take this rejection well and becomes depressed and cynical, leaving him to believe that Summer was right, that nothing means anything and love is just a fantasy.\n\tTom once said before Summer broke his heart, \"I love her, I love the sound of her laugh, I love her cute knees, I love this heart shaped birthmark she has, and I love the song I hear when I'm with her.\" After his brutal break up, so to speak with her he repeats, \"I hate Summer, I hate her hair, I hate her cackling laugh, I hate her knobby knees, I hate that splotch she calls a birthmark, and I hate this song!\"\n\tA few months later Summer invites Tom over to her place for a party and Tom's expectations exceed reality. At the party he comes to discover that Summer, whom he still loves, had recently become engaged. This breaks him down for months, until he finally gets up, quits his job, and goes on to find his passion in life. More months pass and Tom runs into Summer again, and she tells him that he was right all along about love and that it does exist. This leaves Tom bewildered and somewhat satisfied. Later that day Tom meets another woman named Autumn.\n\tI enjoyed this movie because it explained the ups and downs of love and the very realness of fate. I also enjoyed the actors in the film, Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt, and how they conveyed the lack of love in their relationship. Tom and Summer weren't meant for eachother, they were destined to meet new people to fall in love with. Which Summer had already done and now its Tom's turn. The film shows that just because love fails once doesn't mean it always will.",

The thing that really drags this movie down is Deschanel, she is just so annoying and very bland. The redeeming qualities are Gordon-Levitt is amazing and relatable and the ending is pretty good. I do wish that they added a few minutes to the movie just to show us what happens to Tom and Autumn but they didn't. This is a movie you watch after a break up or with some friends just as a random movie night, if you want to watch a good movie with a very similar premise just watch Don Jon a much superior Gordon-Levitt movie.",

But 500 Days of Summer exhibits a cleverly constructed structure telling of the high and lows of a relationship between Tom and Summer. The usual structure is thrown out of the window and instead highlights dozens of moments big and small, happy and sad, as the story of Tom and Summer gradually draws ever closer to the 500th day and whatever that particular day brings with it.\n\nAccompanying this fantastic and creative storyline are two brilliant lead actors. Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel were perfect for the roles. Not only is their off-screen chemistry replicated on-screen, they create a perfect balance in their relationship as it moves on throughout the film.\n\nA unique romantic comedy that is unlike any before. The film's realism in terms of actual relationship's rather than Hollywood's clich\u00e9d perfect romance is a big factor in why this film has received not only a high mark by me (a very honour indeed!) but also esteemed film critics that have remarked upon the innovative and delightful storyline, structure, acting and music. The combination of it all thus creates a romantic comedy that has surpassed them all in delivering a believable and heart wrenching story of relationships.\n\nhttps://rwh92.wordpress.com/",

The idea of love, friendships, and relationships all get complicated and this movie portrays a story of all three so well. It makes us think of past experiences with relationships and how something can feel so wonderful and at the same time so confusing. Simply put, it is a love story that isn't a love story.\nSounds complicated? Yes, it does. It is what relationships and love can do to a person. Sometimes we see things that may be perfect for us that are actually imperfect. The story was good, but I feel like something else really made this film stronger. After watching it the second time or more, I noticed very subtle expressions from the male protagonist that really amazed me with his acting skills in this movie. You can almost feel how he felt during his moments whether it was during his attraction or anger. You could see it in his eyes and simple facial expressions how he truly reacted to every detailed moment or comment. The emotions felt so real and that is what made this movie even better. If you do not know what I mean, you must see it for yourself. Or if you have watched it already, watch it again and pay attention to the detail in the main character's expressions and how he reacts to every comment the lead female says.",

It is a film that deals with the relationship between Tom and Summer who find themselves working in a company dedicated to the production of gift cards. Over time, they are discovering which are the intentions of one with the other and this is made through a trip in the time in which is navigated between the memories of Tom, that are narrated by a third that never appears. The story unfolds in Los Angeles, and the name of the girl makes an interesting analogy regarding the season of the year, which functions as how brief and momentary an encounter of any kind can be but that being little or much, occupies an important space in our lives. The fact that the argument is not chronological, which does not confuse unless you really have problems as to the notion of this, is a strength in the film because it reveals that memories usually have no order and that after a painful experience, these events are satiated and constantly jump from the sad to the joyful. I loved the fact that the story is being told by a man and not a woman, which brings to us a new perspective of how different can these roles be developed in real life. The problem with it is that it is simply not funny, although it has funny moments but they are not enough to make the plot dynamic, but rather quite relaxing. The most serious is that the relationship between them is uninteresting and as you move forward, their  feelings are shown very superficial and unconvincing. The character of Deschanel is completely detestable, confusing and impossible to be wanted or even understood. Even so, the film retains this tender touch and sweetness that this genre must have, however the main idea is lost several times in how banal and mechanical are the characters all the time.",

And how his non-linear narrative arranges his memories of his relationship from worst to best. \n\nThe choice of using a non-linear style of jumping back and forth between scenes and memories is creative and realistic in this film because it is timely for it's character Tom, though confusing at first. \n\nThe screenplay is creative and artistic in it's approach in portraying how Tom views his relationship. On a certain scene, he's got a musical sequence to the groove of \"You Make My Dreams Come True.\" And then another scene, a black-and-white-silent-film-type of scene that' emulates a confessional.\n\nWhether you're about to watch this for the first time, just finished watching, or hitting the replay button, know that this movie is anchored on Tom, and how he champions his convictions about love and destiny. The screenplay and the non-linear fashion, that everyone talks about, is solely and mutely told from Tom's frame of reference-His expectations that stem from pop culture, how his expectations have been inscribed to his character, and how his expectations fail him. \n\nIt's ending scene is memorable because the movie presents it's message in an inspired, thoughtful, and abrupt fashion.",

            "content": "As imperfect humans do we tend to remember things in an order organized from worst to best - never-ending is the dwelling upon situations either doused in some sort of emotional trauma or some sort of discontent.  Sometimes are good memories premier, but we're more inclined to lying awake at night beating ourselves up over moments we wish we could take back.\n\tAs the entirety of subversive romantic comedy \"(500) Days of Summer\" is told in flashback, kicking off at the tail end of a failed romance, it would perhaps prefer to focus on the finer feelings of its central doomed relationship to its slow burns of heartbreak.  But because it's eerily close in its resembling to one's memory bank - it tells of the five-hundred day long relationship between Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and the eponymous Summer (Zooey Deschanel) in a non-linear style that jumps back and forth between seemingly unrelated days (from Day 2 to Day 250, for example) - there's never a moment not shaded by longing bittersweetness, by empathetic relatability.\n\tBecause we've all had relationships like the one spotlighted in \"(500) Days of Summer.\" An underdog in a genre that takes a liking to perfect matches and champions the unrealistic ideology that is the soulmate, in place is the kind of unbalanced courtship wherein one party is deeply in love while the other is consistently unsure of their true emotions and eventually becomes a heartbreaker.  \n\tThe looming relational train wreck, immediately (and bitterly) is autobiographically revealed at the film's opening, but even without it would we be easily equipped to tell that Tom and Summer's love is distinctly one-sided - Tom would kill for the titular, quirky brunette beauty without hesitation, whereas Summer, despite obviously caring a great deal for the beau she does, in her defense, declare that she doesn't much want to begin with, isn't so sure she can commit to making such declarations surrounding the opposite party anyway.\n\tAnd yet the tragicomic trappings of \"(500) Days of Summer\" arguably make it more memorable a romantic comedy.  How energizing it is to have a genre gem in which the leading couple isn't actually made for each other, in which happy endings aren't so certain in their happily ever after positioning, in which the male hero's more than an idealistic pile of charm and in which the female of interest has more to worry about than her romantic life.\n\tThe screenplay, by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, is appealingly offbeat, packed with charismatic artistic detours that include a musical sequence and a talking head style, black-and-white documentary imitating confessional.  The direction, by Marc Webb, enchants without running into schmaltz.  Levitt is humanely congenial, Deschanel lovable if damaged.\n\tBut by \"(500) Days of Summer's\" end are we, at odds with its mostly impeccable technical and artistic risks, left feeling as though it could be something more than it is.  Pestering me is the notion that we could have been presented with a primary cinematic romance that didn't so often take on the tone of lovestruck boy running after girl who doesn't like him all that much (Summer's various states of disregarding paired with her brushes with ingenuity and authenticity make her a sometimes difficult character to understand - though I suppose that could be precisely the point).  Badgering me is the idea that the characterizing of the beginning and ending of Tom and Summer's relationship is so strong that the juice coming in the middle almost seems nonexistent (which is, therefore, a detrimental setback).  Still, the movie's beautifully nonconforming and oftentimes categorically superior - it's genre fodder a cut above from its formula driven peers.",

The ending scene is ONE OF THE BEST of all-time and truly presents the message of the movie: that although a relationship you were once in, which ended abruptly and hurt you, but brought you so many happy memories, dwelling on what once was will only hurt and cut you deeper and prevent you from seeing what new memories and opportunities lay right in front of you.",

            "content": "Cute and relatable, \"500 Days of Summer\" is yet another solid romantic comedy where Joseph Gordon-Levitt can shine. \n\nTom Hansen, a greeting card writer, falls in love with the secretary of his new boss. However, when it's stated that she doesn't believe in love, nor does she want a serious relationship, he accepts in hope that he can make something more of it. \n\nI knew little, if anything about this movie going into it, but I was excited to watch it. I picked it up on Blu-Ray at my local DVD store for a few bucks and I was finally excited that I had the chance to watch it. To my surprise, it actually turned out to be pretty good. Granted, it doesn't feel like anything new or original, and nothing here is going to blow your mind, but it's a very cute and honest romance that will be able to hit home for more than a few people.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and I've liked Zooey Deschanel in the few things I've seen her in. Individually, they each fill their roles real nicely and Levitt has always been a great, comedic/dramatic actor, but together, they create this very charming and pleasant atmosphere that I'd like to see more of. They work really well together and they build off of each other pretty well. They bring out the personality of the characters and they're able to help relay this great and real message about love.\n\nI feel like the best words to describe the script was cute and realistic. For starters, whenever I say a romantic movie's screenplay is cute, that's a really good thing for me. When I'm able to giggle and relate to the things that the characters themselves are doing, it just helps bring this new experience that I only get to experience every so often in real life. When I say realistic, that means that this movie is completely honest about how our minds work when it comes to different scenarios of love. In the end, all of us just want to love and when we think we've found love, we'll do what we can to pursue it. Even though it's obvious that this is probably not the path that Tom should take, considering he's blatantly told that, it shows how clouded our minds can get and how love can easily take over the human brain. I really like the message this movie portrayed about love and how difficult it can be sometimes.\n\nAlthough I understand why they did it, I'm not sure I liked the format of this movie. They were constantly jumping back and forth from day 1, to day 494, back to day 23, then to day 254, and it just got really confusing at a point. It felt like they were jumping from timeline to timeline just for a few comedic moments and it felt a little bit messy. \n\nI also felt the narration was unnecessary. We didn't need the narration to help guide us through, especially since neither of the characters were doing it. I felt like it could've been more meaningful if Tom was narrating the story, but instead, it was some random guy doing it. It felt out of place and awkward at times to the point where it just got annoying.\n\nThe resolution of the story was also out of left field. I won't spoil anything, but the way it resolved not only conflicted with some moral values of one of the characters, but was a very quick and cheap way to wrap things up. It helps resolve Tom's character but it honestly makes Summer's character more unlikable for me. \n\nStill, in the end, I had plenty of fun with the movie and I was able to leisurely laugh and smile throughout.",

I have seen this movie pretty close to around 10-15 times and It\nhas never gotten old for me. It's not just about a guy trying to get\nthe girl but more about the guy trying to keep the girl.

This movie goes deep into real life love and the ups and downs of how it may happen. \n     (500) Days of Summer is a romantic comedy that shows the love story between two co-workers. It's setup like a timeline, flashback to show how what happened between them. The main character, Tom, has a crush on a girl, Summer, who works in the same building as him. This film shows how they meet, get to know each other, be together, then finally apart. Tom fell in love with a girl who doesn't believe in true love and now is trying to remover what went wrong. It's funny that he consults to his friends for help.  The plot is different from a normal rom com and gives a huge conflict between the characters relationship. It has some good comedy and gives you the thought of what went wrong for them. \n     This film gives an overall theme of \"true love will find its way around.\" (500) Days of Summer can teach you how a relationship can happen and if maybe they were meant to be. It shows that his love will find its way around and adding humor and drama. Not only does it entertain but this movie describes how someone's love life can happen and how to make sure you end up happy. The director here shows the ups and downs on how to get to know someone but hopefully in the most normal way. Also with the crazy things done and how what's meant to happen will happen. \n     The film itself was good. The locations and costumes were realistic. It has a bright lighting and music that matches the story.  The movie has cool shots showing the landscape and the characters together. It also has funny moments showing before and after. \n     Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It had a good setup that's different and a unique storyline. Many twist and turns were there and there really was a nice ending. I would recommend this movie as a morning movie just to sit back and enjoy. It's really cute and funny and has something different then the rest. \n\n-BJ (8th Grade Student)",

The story follows Tom and his hopeless affection for the new assistant Summer in his greeting card business. Throughout the movie they go through many ups and downs and makes for really good entertainment! The transition between their up times and down times shown through the look of the background whenever they show different days was really neat and clever. I'll have to say that this movie sealed the deal that Joseph Gordon Levitt is an amazing actor. He nails it in this movie! Zooey Deschanel too, while not as likable as she is in other things, did a great job. The film's themes of heartache and love is realistic as hell, I mean this is real stuff! While I do appreciate a good straightforward love story at points, it was nice to see a much more realistic view on a possible failed relationship and the struggles that a couple can have. The story has many morals and themes to it, some more hopeful than others but effective for sure. The one that I took from it is that we are not destined to be or stay with one person, life just sort of happens and affects the way we love. The two leads had perfectly shown chemistry of how this is proven. The end of the movie in my opinion was probably as perfect as I wanted it to be. I honestly loved that ending a lot. 500 Days of Summer was a really realistic and tragic story about how a relationship can really take its turns and hit us hard. Something really clicked with me in this movie as the credits rolled. Maybe it's just that the soundtrack was really suiting and made me get that wonderful feeling that I had just seen something special. A-",

Weber. While the rom-com formula has been around for decades prior to this film, Webb, Neustadter and Weber have taken an overly familiar genre and crafted something truly inventive and stylishly clever. This is certainly one of the best romantic comedies of the 21st century.\n\nFull review at http://silverscreenfanatic.com/2015/02/10/benjamins-stash-58/",

            "content": "This film is an anomaly. Coming at a time when everyone was tired of rom-coms promising to be something new and exciting, this movie was marketed as a rom-com which was new and exciting! But that's the only way to describe this little gem of a movie. Sure it's not perfect, but it's difficult to find a movie with such a beautiful sense of melancholy, flashes of laugh-out-loud comedy and a emotional ride from highs to lows which actually effect the viewer.\u00a0\n\nTom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is our not-quite-typical lead. Working at his dead end job as a greeting card writer and half aspiring to be an architect, his routine life is one day interrupted by Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). Tom is immediately enraptured by Summer's stunning looks and intriguing demeanour and decides that he must have her. This is where the film takes a little detour from the schmaltzy beaten track of your run-of-the-mill rom-com. Everything is just a little bit off the normal axis, with endings being presented at the beginning of stories, beginnings taking place at the end and everything else just a little bit out of whack.\u00a0\n\nThis Pulp Fiction-esque narrative style is one of the film's strongest points. Instead of ridiculous running to airport scenes or appearing in the pouring rain outside the girl's front door, we are told from the very beginning that \"This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story.\" So with the big climax taken out of the equation, the entire film turns into a story about what happens in between the meet-cute and the weepy finish. But wait, there aren't any of those either! Tom and Summer meet boringly at work and the big weepy finish simply doesn't exist. Now you start to get the sense of just how brave director Marc Webb and writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Webber have been. Each different scene is prefaced by a number, representing days since meeting Summer. Thus the brackets around (500). This is a tricky narrative style to keep up throughout an entire film, but they manage it. Just. Often the film can feel as if they may be on the very, very edge of using the technique as a stunt, but they never quite slip into that territory. Instead, the film is as light and fresh as new love itself, though never afraid to plunge you from joy straight into sadness.\u00a0\n\nAnother pitfall which many rom-coms fall victim to is a terrible script. Filled with schmaltz and stilted dialogue, they can easily lapse into a slew of cliches, each one less romantic and less comedic than the last, and very rarely actually achieve either of their abbreviated genres. This film, however, is filled with plenty of each. There are moments which will having you rolling around on the floor with laughter and moments which are nothing short of romantic poetry. None of the lines feel forced, each one flowing naturally from each character. This gives the film a realistic feel which is also missing from the main selection of rom-coms available today. It feels as if the characters have been plucked from reality and put onscreen, not the other way around, making the experience of the film all that much more meaningful.\u00a0\n\nBut it's the acting which is the film's real achievement, particularly from the two leads. Jospeh Gordon-Levitt is an absolute revelation here. He never over-dramatises the sadder scenes which would comprimise the feeling of reality, and he plays the humourous moments with the expertise of a seasoned professional. In fact, the entire film rests on his performance. If he had failed, so would the film. And in such a strange style as this, it would be easy for his performance to be lost in the melee of different days of Summer, but, to the writers and directors credit as much as his own, his performance is fantastically memorable and is one of the reasons that you'll come back for repeat viewings over and over again. His performance also achieves the difficult task of being likeable to both sexes, playing sorrowful and morose, but not to the point that he seems like a the girl in the story. Summer, the actual girl in the story, is played perfectly by Zooey Deschanel. Playing a woman who lives in the moment often means that characters have ridiculous and intrusive trademarks like eating dessert first at dinner. For NO REASON! Anyway, Zooey is fantastic, playing Summer with fantastic restraint and none of the over-the-top melodrama that usually accompanies such performances. She makes it difficult for the viewer to figure out whether she's the devil or just misunderstood, or whether it's Tom's fault that she keeps slipping away.\u00a0\n\nBut the film is about two things really: the innovative style and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. These two aspects of the film work together brilliantly to create a melancholy piece with fantastic humour and bittersweet romance which can leave you perplexed, upset, happy and sad all at the same time. And yes, the ending may make you hurl, but if you can look past that, you've got a truly fantastic film which will stand and benefit from repeat viewings, which is really the only option after watching it once.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nExpectations vs. Reality. Incredibly innovative and pure genius.",
