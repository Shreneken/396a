            "content": "\"THE BLIND SIDE\"\nIf every person on Earth once did at least one small and very kind deed, then our world would change significantly for the better, and I am sure that every person living on the blue planet would feel the changes. Directed by John Lee Hancock, this film is based on true events. It was doubly rewarding and exciting to watch this amazing biographical drama knowing that it was based on a true life story.\nThe Blind Side is based on the novel by Michael Lewis. In the original, the book is called The blind side: Evolution of a Game. There are two parallel storylines in the work: in one, the writer investigates how the strategy of games in American football has changed, and in the other, he describes the fate of Michael Oher. He was adopted by a former classmate of Michael Lewis and his wife, Lee Ann and Sean Tui.\nFrom the book The blind side: Evolution of a Game, only the second storyline was taken for the film adaptation. So all the viewers in the world saw the story of Big Mike.\nThe film touches on important topics that are worth reflecting on - the values of life and relationships in the family.\nPlot of the film\nThis film is not about football as it might seem at first glance. It has a deeper meaning. It is about family, about courage and willpower. Human relations between people in this family are put in the foreground. It seems to me that this is a big, just a huge plus for this film. There is no focus on the eternal suffering of children from disadvantaged areas, there is no sugariness and unnecessary drama. We are shown a family that is trying to function as a real, loving family.\nThe film tells about the most difficult period in the life of Michael Oher. He is a homeless, oversized teenager who doesn't even have a change of clothes. Lee Ann Tui accidentally saw him and decided to help him. In the end, everything goes much further than 1-2 nights on the couch in someone else's house: the Tui family takes Michael under guardianship and helps him find his place in life.\nThe acting\nAn excellent cast was assembled for the roles of family members:\nTim McGraw perfectly coped with the role of the soft-bodied head of the family, who completely trusts his wife and supports her in all endeavors.\nSandra Bullock - incomparably played the role of the mother and not in vain received for her 'Oscar' and 'Golden Globe'. From the very first minutes she creates the impression of a strong and confident woman. During the film, she evoked one feeling in me - admiration. Admiration for her decision, her method, putting everything in order, her ability to put someone in their place.\nJay Head is a funny little boy. Particularly smiled were the moments of his drill and interviews with college coaches.\nLily Collins did a very good job as the charming little girl.\nQuinton Aaron - he incredibly got used to the role: on his face we see all Mike's emotional experiences, his insecurity, despondency, sadness. He showed us a guy lost in life who finds purpose only after he finds the love and support of his family.\nRay McKinnon, Coach Cotton, also played well, he was the first to consider Mike's potential and, after a short lecture by Lee Ann, he understands how to treat the team and the players.\nAnd the interactions of the main characters are very carefully brought to the fore, once again emphasizing the main idea of the picture. In general, the film is so balanced that there is not a single superfluous episode, not a single superfluous movement.\nSound\nExcellent musical accompaniment, Carter Burwell as always on top. The background music is well chosen for the film.\nOutcome\nI have always loved to watch films based on real events, biographical, about sports and kindness. And this film combined all these genres that I love to watch.\nThis film showed me that not everything in our world is bought and sold. That not everyone is heartless selfish. There are people who are capable of doing good. And let this family be an example of unity, love, support and understanding.\nSumming up, I can say that the film is full of charm and love. The kindness you find in this movie is amazing. 'The invisible side' - this is the inner world of Michael, who for all those around him remained so. Watch this movie, it will give you a chance to look inside yourself.\nThe film is worth watching, because after watching it, a very pleasant and warm trace remains on the soul, and this is the most important thing!",

I like movies with heart at this time of the year. Sandra Bullock has had some year in 2009. She has a hit rom-com in the summer ('The Proposal') followed by her worst reviewed performance ever ('All About Steve'). Now she turns in what may be her best performance ever as a steel magnolia with a heart of gold. Director John Lee Hancock knows a thing or two about making a feel-good sports movie ('The Rookie') and brings a surprising smartness and sensibility to this one. Quinton Aaron make this gentle giant sympathetic and says a lot without much dialogue. He and Bullock give this story a lot heart that helps it over the weak spots and clichés. Tim McGraw has shown himself to be a pretty good actor and manages a southern-fried sweetness here. Oscar-winner Kathy Bates is very good in a small role. Speaking of which, Bullock is so good here there could be a Best Actress nomination in it for her. And word has it it's hers to lose. She would deserve it too, because she helps make this sports flick a winner",

The movie goes to greater lengths to absolve the Tuohy family of any guilt in boosting for Ole Miss than the book does and, while the story is indeed inspirational in real life, it seems like it was only optioned for a movie because of the baked-in white savior component. The detailed depiction of Michael's life in the projects came off like a borderline-racist caricature of what a white person thinks it would've been like. I'm a little ambivalent about Sandra winning the Oscar for her performance because she also won the SAG and Golden Globe, so they can't all be wrong, but to me the role didn't require much of her and it feels like the votes came in large part due to how likable the character was that she played.",

            "content": "This movie is an insightful one that takes you into the firsthand experiences of current NFL offensive lineman Michael Oher and dramatizes the struggles that he had to go through to get to where he is today. Director John Lee Hancock does a great job recreating an impactful story of a once abandoned child who was adopted and raised by a family of different color and class system. Overall, I enjoyed the effort put into recreating this story and putting the viewers into the situation clearly. \n\nMichael Oher is shown from the beginning stages of his life from a young teen drifting in and out of various schools, all the way to earning his eventual scholarship offers and ultimately becoming an NFL athlete. Michael was one of the 2.9 million children neglected or abandoned in the U.S. every year, however, he was lucky enough to be adopted by an upper class family, the Tuohys. By adopting Michael, Hancock takes you on a journey that shows that while Michael was the one being nurtured and assisted by his new family, he was providing just as much knowledge and learning experiences to the Tuohys, a domestic of a different race. It was an overall learning experience from both parties as we went on this journey of Michael finding himself both in class and on the football field. During this, Oher's new family was learning to live with a family member who wasn't their blood relation. What makes this movie even more powerful is Hancock takes you back to Michael's differing residences as you see where he once lived and how he was mistreated before he was adopted by the Tuohys. All in all, Hancock  provides an accurate biopic of what Oher's life was like growing up.\n\nWhile John Lee Hancock did a great job on this movie, it can be seen that some parts of the movie are more dramatized to capture the audience than what had happened in real life. However, this is understandable in the movie industry and I still pay credit to the legitimacy of the movie in respect to Oher's life.\n\nIf you are an avid sports fan or just like a good plot that will really bring you into the lives of mixed families and the process of adoption, this movie is a must see. It brings together sports, academics, bonding, and emotional conflict all into 129 minutes and will keep you at the edge of your seat. The Blindside educated me on how impactful a surrounding family is and the support system they provide to one's success. Furthermore, it doesn't matter how different your backgrounds are when it comes to being there for one another.",

I went to the theaters, in 2009, to watch this film, and I left feeling so happy that I supported it. After doing further research of the film, not only did they cut out a few useful scenes, they absolutely botched who Michael Oher really is, and his story. This was just a white, feel good film.\n\nHancock made Oher soft & shy, to help build the emotion this film possesses, but in reality, he was an outspoken, delinquent. Quinton Aaron did a good job for what he was handed, but I just couldn't buy into this manufactured story. Jae Head put on a charming performance, playing Big Mike's little brother. His connection with Big Mike was probably one of the best of the film, selling each scene perfectly together. Hancock didn't really focus too much on Collins, or Mr. Touey's character, nearly as much as Mrs. Touey & SJ. The main attraction to this film, was Sandra Bullock. Bullock won an Academy Award for Best Actress, due to her inspiring performance, and being easily the best asset to this film.\n\nOverall, due to the hack job John Lee Hancock did with Michael Oher, and the story as a whole, I really can't recommend this film.",

And when I do, they're either done well (Middle School, 10 Things I Hate About You, The Spy next Door) or quite badly (any Diary of a Wimpy Kid, any Alvin & the Chipmunks, Million Dollar Arm, Parental Guidance).\nMy FIRST impression of this film, before I'd even seen it, was that it was about a professional adult rugby player (wrong) who is so put down by racist comments from opposing team/audience members (not really) that he retires and chats about philosophy with his Mum to pass the time (wrong and wrong). What it's really about is:\nA homeless black teen called Michael Oher who is taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a Christian mother, and her husband, Sean. The Tuohys eventually become Michael's legal guardians, transforming both his life and theirs. Michael's tremendous size and protective instincts make him a formidable football player, and with help from his new family and devoted tutor, he realises his potential.\nThanks Google.\nOf course, I wasn't disappointed with my mistaken assumption. Believe me, I was FAR more interested in sitting through 2hrs of a boy's life being changed then some lectures on life. And plus, I'd never seen ANYTHING like it before. I just put on a blindfold and reserved a movie that was nominated for Best Picture back in 2009.\nThis is also my first Sandra Bullock film, unless you count Minions (2015), so I really couldn't compare this as a best performance (although I'm sure it was). Quinton Aaron also does an excellent job at portraying Michael, the boy with an ugly past but a heart of gold; in FACT, good acting all round.\nThe moment this film hits its height is when it's at its grittiest; all I'll say is that Michael's lucky he's a quarterback!\nIn conclusion, I really feel that I have nothing more to say other than that this drama really opened up my eyes to the American lifestyle and did the best job it could. Would I highly recommend it? No Would I even rewatch it? Probably not, but it did what it was there to do, nonetheless.",

The movie follows traditional family definitions of family and traditional family roles. The film takes us through how an unbreakable bond is made between a mom and son, a dad and a son, and between two siblings. Although Micheal is not blood related to the Tuhoys they still take him and treat him like family. They provide for him and help him play football and go to college and eventually play for the NFL.

            "content": "I haven't hated a film as much as I hated this one in a while. This was a textbook example of why the white savior trope is not only hugely offensive to racial minorities but also painful to watch for audiences. The fact that this film earned a Best Picture nomination should make the Academy feel ashamed of themselves as it's possibly one of the worst films of 2009. Sandra Bullock's Best Actress win was also ridiculous as she is at her scenery chewing worst and nominated against obviously superior actresses like Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren. I have a burning hatred for this film and yet, much like a car crash, I found myself watching and cringing as the events unfolded against John Lee Hancock's tasteless direction.\n\nWealthy, privileged housewife Leigh Anne Tuohy, Sandra Bullock, adopts an African-American teenager out of guilt and because she wants a pet project to brag about to her equally privileged friends. She, and she alone, trains Michael Oher, Quinton Aaron, to be a competent human being and trains him in how to be good at football. Then it is discovered that the Tuohy family probably only took Michael in because they wanted him to attended Ole Miss University. This conflict is quickly brushed aside however and we reaffirm that Leigh Anne is a saint.\n\nThe complete lack of tension at any point in this film caused it to feel inert and stale which didn't help when the characters were so easy to hate or to poke fun at. When tensions are brought up I placed myself firmly on the side of those who \"attack\" Leigh Anne because they often made reasonable arguments and I wanted to see this annoying, privileged woman be taken down a notch. When you have one of the only African-American characters in the film be a villainous investigator from the NCAA who interrogates a seemingly deranged Michael it doesn't send the right message. At no point did I feel that Leigh Anne or her family were in any way at risk for the supposedly difficult decision they made and that only added to the sickening feeling that this family had taken this boy under their wing out of vanity not altruism.\n\nThis was also one of those ‘creepy' Christian films in which references to the lord and Christianity are dropped in here and there, enough to appeal to the Southern conservative base while not isolating those who aren't on board with the views that the film is in favor of. I was grossed out by how the film presents Leigh Anne as this angelic woman who saves Michael from his evil African-American community and when his biological mother tells her she is a \"good Christian woman\" I wanted to slap Leigh Anne. Beware that if you watch this film with even an ounce of decency within your body you will also want to throw up at the sight of these horrors.\n\nGetting to Bullock's performance I have to say that it is the worst to ever win an actress the coveted Academy Award as Bullock is simply awful. Yes, she is working with terrible material but even the moments that most actresses could sell are fumbled by the incompetent Bullock. Had Judy Davis or Sissy Spacek been cast in this role you can bet it would have appeared a hell of a lot better on screen and they wouldn't have messed up a simple line like \"No, he's changing mine,\" as bad as it is. I think that the 2009 Best Actress category was fairly weak but Meryl Streep gives a fantastic performance as Julia Child that reaches beyond impersonation in Julie & Julia (2009).\n\nDon't ever, ever watch this film. It mystifies me how this piece of trash received any critical praise but the negative reappraisal that it has received was correct because it is as bad as everybody says it is and it proves that we need to get rid of the white savior trope once and for all. I would suggest that people watch every film nominated for Best Picture in 2009 over this film because I don't think I have seen many films worse than this one.",

Aaron's performance holds the movie together, when otherwise it might spin out into obnoxious or hokey sentimentality.  No, Sandra Bullock isn't the key to the film's success, despite receiving an award for her performance.  I consider Bullock a mediocre actress, one who tries to obscure her shallowness with stagey acting that looks just like acting.  She's better than usual here, despite the one-note quality of her performance, and at times is somewhat charming as the determined surrogate mother for Michael. But she still tries to chew the scenery too much with over-acting.  Her Oscar for this tell you only what a hopeless band of cheerleaders the Academy often is.  The film works as much despite Bullock as because of her.  If you want a tear-jerker with an inspirational message in a tidy package, this film will do nicely.

            "content": "Krista Phillips\nAdrian Ramjoue\nLanguage Arts 11\n8 Mar. 2018\nThe Blind Side is a sports film of the typical 'underdog' story.  Based off of the true story of how Michael Oher, was drafted into the NFL.  The entire design revolves around the point of giving the improbable hero, Michael, a life-changing chance- which ends up altering everything previously known to him.  Michael had grown up on the streets when Leigh Anne Tuohy brought him into her home- and eventually turned his life around.  The purpose of the Blind Side, is to present the life of someone who lives in poverty and how that can change their life, with ease and even humor.   This is seen through showing the adoption into a white family, friendships made in the movie, and creating a story around a sought-after athlete.  \n    The focal point of the movie The Blind Side is that Michael Oher's life changed because he was adopted into a white family.  He was born and raised in poverty and knew nothing else.  The contrast between his old life and a new life shines a light on how poverty really is, by showing the opposing side of an upper-class family.  An example of this seen in the movie is showing his reaction to his new room in the Tuohey house.  Michael tells Leigh Anne that he's never had one before so she responds by asking if he's talking about having a room to himself, he responds with \"A bed.\"  These two words say lots about his previous life where he had been on and off the streets, and where he did not even have something he could call a bed.  Through showing us the life of a wealthy family we see that it's not like that in lower-income families.  \n    The film also makes an emphasis on the friendships made throughout the movie.  It shows the growth in trust as Michael begins to get to know his new family.  During the movie, his relationships with his family begins to grow, and as it does the film gives brief flashbacks to his old life and the influence his old friends had on him.  Michael was having a hard time adjusting to his new life, and it showed him going back to his old life, with his old friends.  The friends were partying, drinking, and likely doing other illegal activity for their age.  At this point in Michael's life, he already had the healthy influence of the Tuohy family and understood that what they were doing was wrong. \"David (one of Michael's closest friend's) is portrayed as a gang member who doesn't really want to be a gang member but he doesn't really see another option.  He doesn't have any guidance so he takes the path of least resistance, which is the gang.\" (Scribbles \"The Blind Side\").   It is apparent that without the influence of the Tuohy's in his life, he may not have had the moral conscience to know when to stop- which could have changed his life dramatically.  \n    Once Michael has achieved a good enough grade point average, he is allowed to play on the football team.  Michael had never played football and did not understand the rules.  Leigh Anne Tuohy was able to use Michael's past experiences in order to help him better understand the object of the game and his role to his team.  Through the help of his teammates, coaches, and family Michael becomes an extremely talented athlete that many colleges want to play for them.  His life changed drastically from being homeless to now being one of the most vital athletes to college recruiters.  Without the opportunity given to him by the Tuohy family, Michael would have never been able to play football in high school, college, and eventually the NFL.  \"The film eventually gives us the immense satisfaction of seeing footage of the real Michael Oher and the Tuohys at his 2009 draft to the Baltimore Ravens.\" (The Harvard Crimson).\n    Those with an opposing claim would say that the purpose of The Blind Side is to create another racist story.  This is valid because where Michael had lived, before moving in with the Tuohy's, it never shows a single Caucasian person, only those of African American race.  This is seen as racist because it makes them feel as though they are not good enough to live in an upper-class setting.  However, the movie uses real-life scenarios, 14.5 percent of Americans live at a poverty level, of that percentage, African Americans had the highest poverty rate, 27.4, and whites had the least, 9.9 percent.  The film doesn't feed into racism, but rather shows how it is in reality.  \nIn essence, opinions on the quality, or enjoyment of the overall film, may not have change.  However, with a new found understanding of the purpose of the film, it may be easier to understand what others have seen in it.  The purpose of the Blind Side, is to present the life of someone who lives in poverty and how that can change their life.  The director, John Hancock, was successful in achieving his purpose during the movie.  He gave examples through adoption into a white family, which gives contrast to his old life.  He also showed his new found friendships, which give him higher moral standards than old friends.  Last, he is given a chance to be a professional athlete, by going to a high-end Christian high school and learning the rules of football.  These variables all come into play, to create something that inspired people, and made them happy.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotated Bibliography: The Blind Side\nNewton, David. \"Michael Oher gives negative review to effect 'The Blind Side' has had.\" ESPN, 18 June 2015, http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/13100161/michael-oher-carolina-panthers-says-hit-movie-blind-side-hurt-career.\n    Web.\nMichael Oher describes his challenges with his ability to play football, now that the movie has been released.  He states that people no longer see the skill he really has, and that it's because of the movie.  Generally speaking, most people don't watch the offensive line, however every time that Michael Oher plays, every move is seen and noted.  Michael Oher has speculated that it's because of the movie, that people are so nit picky about how he plays.  Michael Oher believes that his value as a player has decreased since the release of The Blind Side in 2009.  The article uses ethos, in using the athlete that the movie is about, as well as talking about his coaches and teammates.  The article also uses pathos by using what his signed contract amount is for, and who he plays for.

The article shared some of his trials as he was homeless after being removed from custody of a mother that was addicted to drugs, as well as integrating into an all white school.

He made the subjects light to make it easier to swallow, but still gave it enough seriousness as to not make fun of the topics.  It spoke of the unlikely friendship between the wealthy Leigh Anne Tuohy, and Michael Oher, as the two take on new challenges together, like Michael's failing GPA, and his lack of aggression on the football field.  She explains to him that he needs to protect his team as he would his own family, once Michael starts to understand the game, he wants to start earning better grades to continue playing.  This is a secondary source.\nThe Blind Side. Dir. John Hancock. Perf. Quinton Aaron. Warner Bros., 2009. Film.\nFilm.\nThe blind side is a film about the story of Michael Oher and his journey becoming a professional athlete.  Michael had been throughout school for years, and was homeless, when Leigh Anne Tuohy took him into her family; gave him a bed, schooling, food, and love.  Leigh Anne brings his protective instincts to the football field, during practicing showing him how to protect his team, eventually making him a very sought after athlete from numerous universities.  A main theme found in the film is love.  We see that Leigh Anne is a Christian woman, who brings a homeless teenager in her house, when no one has asked her to. She not only houses and clothes him, but she treats him like family.  One bias is that the director of the movie is white, as well as the 'heroine' Mrs. Tuohy, where as Michael is a large black man.  Many people have seen this as prejudice that black people need the whites to survive. The movie is strongly related to pathos, tugging at your heartstrings through every trial the family goes through, as well as raising your spirits with it's humor and uplifting message.

Web. 25 January, 2018.\n    Web.\nSandra Bullock, Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates star in this remarkable true story of All-American football star Michael Oher. Teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is surviving on his own, homeless, when he is spotted on the street by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). This begins their story together and their struggles and challenges they face.  The trailer appeals to people through pathos, giving it the underdog story, and also talking about The United States of America's favorite sport; football.  This film encompasses everything we love about most sports related movies; humor, the underdog, the sports, and the feel-good story.  The film brings contrast of two completely different worlds, upper class, and impoverished life together to create a story that everyone will love.  This is a secondary source.",

            "content": "A movie which will initially evoke feelings of \"been there, seen that\", The Blind Side is a based on true events sports drama which strikes the viewers with its huge heart, touching and inspirational story. A simple and predictable delivery, it explores the loving and giving nature of people, without falling into annoying or boring cliches. \n\nJohn Lee Hancock's delivery tells the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a poor teenager whose fate is changed when the Tuohy family (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw) open their house to him. A story of giving love, helping each other and believing in success, The Blind Side would have been just another feel-good tear-jerker if it was not for smooth blend of drama and comedy as well as the brilliant performances of Quinton Aaron and especially Sandra Bullock. Both of them, directed by Hancock, succeed to deliver moments of tears and moments of fun to the audiences in an extremely convincing and heart-warming way. The story of how Michael was saved and elevated from poor, crime-soaked environment to a college and NFL stardom is one that will surely please the mainstream viewers. However, what deserves also a significant attention is Sandra Bullock's performance. The depiction of the conservative, but determined Leigh Anne Tuohy is one that earns admiration. Bullock succeeds to amplify the  dramatic moments and touch the hearts of the viewers with her endless believe in good and second chances, which ultimately got her the Academy Best Actress Award\n\nIn conclusion, The Blind Side is one of these rare and delightful gems which go completely against the odds of the majority of deliveries from this painfully known and cliched genre. A movie to be seen over and over again, the story of Michael Oher is one that I would strongly recommend (and watch over and over again).",

In this heart jerking movie, we better understand how life is different for everyone. Michael Oher, a high school teenager, is a ward of the state. Leigh Anne Tuohy, who is played by Sandra Bullock, is a upperclass woman that is a take charge person and is not afraid of anyone or anything. His father, as we eventually find out, killed himself by jumping off of a bridge. His mother was a bonafide crack head. Michael Oher was virtually homeless and survived on his own, but one night Michael was out on the streets with nowhere to go and his life would be forever changed. His adoption into the Tuohy family helped him, but the members of the Tuohy family lives would never be the same. It's not just about a rich white woman helping out a poor black kid, it's more than that. It's about the change of a family. When they show the real footage of the Tuohy family, with Michael, you realize what an impact it has on you. Other than that, it is an enjoyable film. The real Michael Oher went on to play college football at Ole Miss and then on to playing in the National Football League for the Baltimore Ravens.",

I'm all for inspirational films, but this one looked like an overcooked, manipulative tearjerker with Sandra Bullock stepping way outside of her comfort zone to play a Good Samaritan Southern Belle who helps a struggling black teen with a painful past. I was afraid the film would exploit or gloss over the true pains of African-Americans struggling to escape the projects. I was afraid Sandra Bullock, whose forte is romantic comedies, would annoy with an attempt at a Southern accent. I was afraid that the power of this true story would be lost in hackneyed and trite filmmaking.\n\nMy fears were unfounded, and one cannot, it appears, judge a film by its trailer. This is one of the best mainstream films about Christians I've ever seen, possessing charm, integrity, and honesty in spades. Bullock's stab at a Southern accent, while dubious in a two-minute trailer, is actually quite convincing when viewed in the complete film. She truly loses herself in the role, and much to my surprise, I'd like to see her win an Oscar for her tough-love portrayal of a woman whose cannot help but help others. Country-music superstar Tim McGraw, as her husband, proves himself a capable actor, Granted, he doesn't have to do any heavy emotional lifting in the film, but his ability to deliver lines of dry humor was an unexpected delight. Newcomer Quinton Aaron, as the young man helped by Bullock's family, conveys a great deal of pain, sorrow, and joy with his eyes.",

Leigh Anne's husband Sean remarks later on the couple's prejudices, \"we would have a black son before we knew a Democrat? \"There aren't that many one-liners in \"The Blind Side,\" which is basically a true rarity: a fish-out-of-water drama about race relations centering on Michael, who, like the heroine of \"Precious,\" is large, African-American, abused and functionally illiterate. Michael is on the verge of flunking out of a lily-white Christian academy when Leigh Anne - seeing him running around in shorts and a T-shirt during the dead of winter decides to make him an improbable member of her family. The Tuohy's young son is on board with the idea, although his older sister resists at first. The reaction from Leigh Anne's friends is more pointed. \"Is this a white guilt thing?\" one friend asks her. In fact, the well-to-do Tuohy's, who describe themselves as rednecks, are no liberals - but they take Christian principles seriously. They do meet that Democrat, a liberal tutor hired to help Michael improve his grades enough that he can try out for the school's football team, Michael Oher became a star for the University of Mississippi and was drafted by the NFL's Baltimore Ravens this year.

These are all what I look for in a movie, and \n\nhow i'll be reviewing The Blind Side. When I go to see a movie I am always looking for how the \n\nactors/ actresses play the part, the quality of the graphics, the storyline is consistent, that the \n\npace of the movie isn't too fast you can understand what is happening, and looking to see if \n\nthe plot is a continuous thing throughout the movie.\n\n\tWhen looking at actors/ actresses i am looking for how well they play the part. I want to \n\nsee if they really fit the part; like do they connect with the person that they are playing? In The \n\nBlind Side I feel like the actors, and actresses really fit the part that they are playing. It really \n\nseemed like they were actually a family; was as if they really weren't acting or playing a part. \n\n\tWhile looking at graphics I want to see stuff that looks realistic. I want to see stuff \n\nthat's like really high quality and looks extremely real; like it actually happened. I also want to \n\nsee that it wasn't just done on a computer screen; while looking at this category Ill also be \n\njudging it on how the actors/actresses react to it, or act when they are interacting with the \n\ngraphics.  This movie had great graphics. \n\n\t\n\nWhen I see a movie I want to see the storyline be continuous; I don't want something that \n\nis confusing or anything like that. I want it to make sense, and for it to be easily to understand, \n\nbut still entertaining.  I also want to see good development of how the storyline comes together.  \n\nLooking for the graphics, and the quality of the graphics is pretty easy to do, just look for how \n\nreal they look. Like fake blood , fake fighting and multiple things like that. \n\nDuring a movie I want to see the plot being continued throughout the whole movie.  \n\nSome movies just have the plot on certain time like when it's actually happening but then they go \n\nright into solving it I also like to see a interesting plot, I don't want to see a boring plot because \n\nthen the movie is usually boring. \n\n \tSo basically how I reviewed The Blind Side is on actors/ actresses, pace, \n\nstoryline, and plot development.  I hope you can see what I mean, with the categories and why I \n\nlook for those things in a movie.",

            "content": "Writer/Director John Lee Hancock's adaptation of Michael Lewis' true-story book \"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game\" is a tactfully hedged intriguing mixture of complicated socioeconomics', politics and willpower.\n\nEmbodying her character as a wealthy All-American Memphis Republican housewife, Sandra Bullock couldn't be more deserving of her first Academy Award nomination in this career-best role. Often overlooked for her questionable comedic pursuits, it is wonderful to see Bullock back in the Drama style she has such talent for. \n\nFinding new talent and athletic prowess is top private school football Coach Burt Cotton's (Ray McKinnon) job. After setting sight on 16-year-old African-American gentle giant Michael Oher, derogatorily known as Big Mike (played by Quinton Aaron), Cotton found the offensive left tackle  (Blind Side player) of his dreams.\n\nIn an uphill battle, Cotton is determined to convince the straight laced and conservative school board that it is their \"Christian duty\" to give the boy the education he deserves. Learning disorders and all, Oher is enrolled in school on one condition; he cannot play sports until his grade point average reaches the basic standard.\n\nQuiet and introverted, the undereducated 'Big Mike' instantly falls behind in class, unable to communicate his comprehension in the expected methods. A misfit in every way, Oher's problems stem even further than the classroom. Son of a crack-addicted mother and absentee father, Oher's is alone in the world; homeless, penniless and living out of the school gym.\n\nOne night, as Oher waits for the gym to empty, he is confronted by the white well-to-do Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). Brash in her mother-knows-best approach, Leigh Ann demands that Oher come home with her family.\n\nA woman with purpose in her stride and absolute certainty in her heart, Leigh Ann's perfectly cultured upper-crusted exterior conceals a complex and deeply caring woman. \n \nConcerned with his well-being, Leigh Ann invites Oher to stay. Crossing into the Ghetto (Hurt Village) to collect the last of \"Big Mike's\" meager possessions, Leigh Ann realizes the extent of society's failures towards Michael and single handedly decides to put them right.\n\nCreating him a home, giving him a personal and respectable identity and getting his grades up to standard, Leigh Ann finally gets him on the football field and the path to a decent life.\n\nAs expected this story utilizes every cliché. Can Michael get the grades he needs to get into college? Can he fully comprehend the game well enough to play? Will she stand up to her snobby socialite friends? Does Leigh Ann have an ulterior motive to her do-gooder ways? \n\nIf you can see past some of the cringe-worthy 50cent cash-in lines, Bullock injects humor and strength into this very delicate and soft true-story biopic. \n\nThe exact opposite to the fictional Best Picture nominee Precious, \"The Blind Side\" doesn't feel the need to delve into the gritty and authentic sense of defeat and despair of the situation, rather present a cleanly polished, packaged and palatable uplifting journey. \n\nSimilarly, opposed to its other Best Picture nominee Invictus, \"The Blind Side\" doesn't harbor dreadfully on-field, resisting the urge to descend into a mediocre sports movie. \n\nExceptionally well-cast, Bullock is teamed with movie newcomer Quinton Aaron. Aaron's understated and appealing performance is pleasant and easy to accept. Kathy Bates' contrasting character as a left-wing Democratic tutor sits well within the film. Country Singer Tim McGraw and 12 year old Jae Head bring a well crafted light-heartedness and innocence respectively to the film.\n\nThe Verdict:  Although nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, this wonderfully positive and emotive story has an overly glossy mainstream style and lacks the hard-edge of its competitors.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 05/03/2010",

Michael Oher lives on the opposite side of the tracks. He grew up with a drug addict for a mother and has been living on friend's couches for years. Their world's collide and Michael eventually lives with the Tuohy's. They welcome him into their home despite the negative feedback from the community. Michael discovers his passion for football and gets numerous college football offers. The movie is a feel good movie and does a good job with keeping the plot moving with many tear jerking moments such as a crazy car accident with Michael and SJ the Tuohy's young son.

The film focuses on the relationships that characters develop, and how these relationships change the characters.\n\tThe character progression throughout the movie creates a sense of personality, allowing you to be empathetic towards them and therefore pull you more into the story. The variation of ages and personalities makes the film appealing to everyone in the family because it is easy to identify with one or multiple characters in The Blind Side. The movie portrays the struggles of this unusual family in a comedic yet touching way, leaving you feeling uplifted. The movie does a really great job of reflecting the feelings the real Touhy family experienced during the early days of Michael Ohre's football career and life as part of their family. \n\tWatching the movie alone brings back the best feelings of growing up in a happy family, and makes you appreciate the things you had on an everyday basis that others were not fortunate enough to have. Aside from bringing back memories, the Touhy family is an inspiration through their love and compassion for Michael. Michael returns the feelings in his own subtle ways that prove how grateful he is to his family. \n\tWatching this movie is guaranteed to uplift and inspire all ages. It is one of those movies you can watch anytime and still love the way it makes you feel. Overall, The Blind Side is a great movie that manages to evoke feelings that lead to laughing, crying, and everything in between.",

And the Tuohys have found something just as life-changing: a beloved new son and brother. This real-life story of family and of Michael's growth into a blue-chip action and heartwarming emotion.

            "content": "It's impossible for this film not to be overhyped. So the natural reaction after watching it is either utter jubilation or bitter dissappointment. However, after taking the film itself into consideration, without the critical hype and ridiculous whispers of Best Picture, the film itself is not all that bad. \n\nThe plot revolves around two central characters, Sandra Bullock's Leigh Anne Tuohy and Quinton Aaron's Michale Oher. There are no qualms about the plot, it's fairly straightforward, simple and bred to bring tears, it's the rest of the film which is the problem. The sugary look of Michael's old neighbourhood is terribly restrained in order to maintain a PG rating; a slum made up of gangsters whose main weapon is calling people names. The minor characters are dreadfully thought out; the extremely annoying young boy playing the wiser-than-thou card, a teenage girl who apparently has no problem with ditching her friends and no insecurity about anything, seemingly at peace with having a boy walk in while she's wearing a ridiculous facial mask, not to mention having less lines than a mute, a tutor whose role is difficult to define, a father who seems to do nothing but bend to his wife's wishes and go along for the ride and a coach who might as well not be there. There is also the small problem of having a lead actor who can't actually act. \n\nHowever, Sandra Bullock's performance is the film's redemption. She is rock solid throughout the film, never once leaving character, strange for a woman who's nominated for a Razzie this year. Her strong, maternal role is the star of the show, but it's the moments when her underlying emotions bubble to the surface that really define the performance. She deserves more screen time than she gets, and you'll wish that she had more by the end of the film. \n\nPeople say that you should take a box of tissues with you because otherwise your shirt will be soaked, but I didn't cry at all. Mostly thanks to Aaron's extremely unconvincing performance. But if you're in the mood for something you don't have to think about, I would recommend this. \n\nDefining Scene: \nSaying goodbye to Michael, Sandra's emotional side kicks in.",

The film is focused on the beginning of Oher´s football career and all what he had to go trough to triumph in the said sport.\nAs a non USA citizen I had to admit that I have never liked \"football\", unlike most people that had seen this film, so I didn't expect much from this stereotypical sport film. \"The Blind Side\" counts with a really amazing story as the film´s source material but its translation to big screen lost some of the story´s power by lacking a memorable directing, well written supporting characters and suffering the expected Hollywood exaggeration treatment; Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron deliver solid performances but the rest of the cast left something to be desire regarding their acting; it has a handful of scenes that stand on their own, the first half of the film (before the football comes into the picture) is actually entertaining and well made, and this film is filled with clichés and cheap ways to touch your heartstrings  that most people fall for but the effect it has on others, like me, is to make us roll our eyes. \n\"The Blind Side\" is a film filled with clichés that still manages to entertain you for most of its long runtime but overall has almost nothing to talk about other than the source material and both Bullock´s and Aaron´s performances, but other than that this film has absolutely nothing.",

This is a true story about an African American homeless inner-city kid who gets adopted by this affluent white family. Sandra Bullock essentially takes Michael under her wing and puts her stewardship into practice. She gives an outstanding performance aside from the forced dodgy accent. It is what fuels the movie and guides it in the right direction, even though even she loses footing once or twice. She's still got the chops though, with that dash of Sandra corniness. She does incorporate a spattled method to her madness like none other. Also I love the little brother, S.J., and his storyline. It really attributes to the ethic of the movie. Him and Michael are like Mutt and Jeff. I firmly believe this movie did get lost in the mix of its time period. Looking back, I  was considerably surprised that there was no awards contention or at least more buzz about the acting guild. The cast was inspirationally good. Team Ward. The source material was so rich in fiber that the movie kinda wrote itself though actually, and really despite the cast the movie had no outside influence. I relent on whether it gave the story actual justification. A lot of this seems like a cram cram cram directorial technique. Like he had too much to do and not enough time to do it. Everything felt rushed, yet somehow felt too long.",

I do think that it's trying too hard to make a drama moment when there's lots of good drama moments in this. The acting in this is great, but it's Sandra Bullock who gives an memorable performance in this. She's funny, heartfelt, and shows the care here. It has some hilarious moments in it too which is unexpected when I saw it. The only thing I forgot about when I watched it first is Lily Collins, it's nice to see her in this too, and she's also really good in this too. I do see why people think the kid is annoying, I also thought the kid was annoying when I first saw it. But after seeing the scenes that I thought he was annoying in, he was not that annoying and he's really funny.

            "content": "Essentially a remake of The Waterboy, Adam Sandler's eponymous hero is replaced by a young man from the projects of african-american origins, the sort of young man Hollywood is fond bestowing magical, mystical powers upon. In this case, Michael, the young man in question, is a quasi-retarded bohemoth, equal parts Michael-Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile and Sloth from The Goonies.\n\nMichael says nothing, does nothing, hinting we are to presume, at untold sorrows. He arrives at a well-heeled Catholic private school by some crude machination I've forgotten the details of, thus starting on the road to redemption, college and ultimately the NFL that we know is the conclusion of his story (it being a true story and all). He's taken in and saved from his pitiful existence spent hanging around laundromats and kids playgrounds by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a brassy, sassy Southern belle and queen bee of the smuggest family in existence. \n\nTuohy has the gaudy jewellery, the tight white pants, multiple BMW's and all the tacos she can eat. She eats $18 salads with WASP stereotypes and donates to multiple charities but still something is missing from her life. Driving home from her daughter's volleyball game, the entire family ensconsced in the sort of vulgar comfort only an X5 can offer, a divine convergence brings Michael into their life. Michael lives in a plastic bag and can't speak, so naturally they drive him back to their house, give him a couch to sleep on, a pile of rugby shirts, an enormous dinner, some books and a massive pick-up truck.\nAll they ask in return is that he plays football. They don't, of course, say it in so many words, but there's an implicit threat in Tuohy's shrew-like features. \nWhen Michael first steps on to the field, after what feels like a lifetime, the expectations are enormous. I mean, he's huge, and well, you know, black. Surely he's going to brilliant? He's a disaster though, getting pushed around, smiling at childresn, pointing at ballons, and it's not until Tuohy brushes the gormless coach aside and demands the entire team suckles on her teat of sassy, southern motherly wisdom. From that moment Michael and the team are transformed and run riot over the ramshackle redknecks assembled in opposition.\nTuohy's ridiculous cunt of a son makes a dvd of Michaels one high-school football game, sends it to every college in the bible belt and before you know it we're treated to a delightful montage of elderly Southern gentlemen, the type who survive by sucking the souls out of others, masturbating furiously, frothing cocks in hand, over endless replays of Michael pushing guys around. \nThe only thing now standing between Michael and endless riches, not to mention an appearance on Cribs, is his GPA. He needs straight A's for the rest of the year, but how could he ever do this? The guy can barely write. The answer, of course, is Kathy Bates. Reprising her role from The Waterboy, she signs on as Miss Sue, Michaels personal tutor and infinite font of homespun wisdom. With her help Michael gets the required grades, and even has time to visit the project, beat up a bunch of gansta's and learn how to close his eyes.\nAfter trying out for the college coaches in a very subtle satire on the old slave auctions (and kudos to the makers for tackling such sensitive subject matter in a delicate and even-handed manner), Michael goes to the college of his forefathers and pushes around a load of other guys in tight pants. As expected, he's brilliant at this and graduates from college, voted \"Guy most likely to push other guys around\" and gets drafted to the NFL.\nAn incredibly brave film, combining broad slapstick humour and documentary style reportage, it's no surprise the Academy have chosen to embrace this film, and Bullock in particular. She really does have a very nice bottom.",
