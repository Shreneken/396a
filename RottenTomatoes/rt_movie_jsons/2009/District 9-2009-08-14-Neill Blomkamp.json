    "summary": "Thirty years ago, aliens arrive on Earth -- not to conquer or give aid, but -- to find refuge from their dying planet. Separated from humans in a South African area called District 9, the aliens are managed by Multi-National United, which is unconcerned with the aliens' welfare but will do anything to master their advanced technology. When a company field agent (Sharlto Copley) contracts a mysterious virus that begins to alter his DNA, there is only one place he can hide: District 9.",

The makeup and practical and special effects were done really well, especially with the main character's arm/transformation. It was also neat how they tried to explore deeper themes behind an alien race coming to Earth and how well they did and didn't get along with humans. I feel like if something like this happened in real life it would likely play out like this on a societal/political level. Plus, it was satisfying to see the power of the alien technology/weapons and their destructive capabilities. Probably my favorite part of the movie!",

Neill Blomkamp's sci-fi mockumentary is a little 'Independence Day,' a little 'E.T.,' with a dash of 'Robocop' thrown in for good measure. The filmmakers take us into the story 'Blair Witch'-style, shifting into a refugee-on-the-run story for most of its second half. It's engrossing and fascinating. Filmed for $30 million in Johannesburg (South Africa), obvious thematic parallels to apartheid come up. The \"hero's\" name is Van De Merwe, a common white African last name. The aliens speak in clicks, similar to the language Bantu, spoken by many of the black African targets of apartheid. The film doesn't have the allegorical heft it should, mostly due to the splatter-happy bloodbath that is the third act. The CGI blends in seamlessly with the hand-held camcorder footage, giving the film impressive immediacy. Sharlto Copely portrays the main character's arc, from cynical bureaucrat to victimized refugee to alien accomplice, with empathy. What's most amazing here is how by the end of the film, Blomkamp makes us sympathize with these ugly, vile-looking aliens. As a sociology lesson it isn't much, but as straight sci-fi action it packs a visceral wallop",

Sadly, the second half of the movie degenerates into a Michael Bay-like action flick, with heads vaporizing, everything imaginable exploding, and an excess of gunfire.  It's still worth a watch, but it's sad to think what could have been if the filmmakers had stuck to the vibe established over the first half of the film.",

            "content": "In 1982, a giant extraterrestrial spaceship arrives and hovers over the South African city of Johannesburg. An investigation team finds over one million malnourished aliens (derogatorily called \"Prawns\") inside, and the South African government relocates them to a camp called District 9. However, over the years it turns into a slum, and locals often complain that the aliens are filthy, ignorant lawbreakers who bleed resources from humans. Following unrest between the aliens and locals, the government hires Multinational United (MNU), a huge weapons manufacturer, to relocate the aliens to a new camp outside the city. Piet Smit, an MNU executive, appoints MNU employee and his son-in-law Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley), to lead the relocation. Meanwhile, three aliens, Christopher Johnson, his young son CJ and his friend Paul, search a District 9 garbage dump for alien fuel in Prawn technology, which Christopher has had them spend the last twenty years synthesizing enough of to enact his plan. They finally finish in Paul's shack as the relocation begins but when Wikus comes to the shack to serve Paul a notice, he finds the hidden container with the fuel and accidentally sprays some of it in his face while confiscating it. Paul is killed by Koobus Venter, a cruel MNU mercenary.\nWikus begins mutating into a Prawn, starting with his left arm injured after the fuel exposure. He is immediately taken to the brutal MNU lab, where researchers discover his chimeric DNA grants him the ability to operate Prawn weaponry, that is biologically restricted for them. Wanting to capture this human/alien hybridity before Wikus fully transforms, Smit orders Wikus's body to be vivisected and harvested for its profitable properties. Wikus, however, overpowers the lab personnel and escapes. While Venter's forces hunt for him, a smear story is broadcast, one that reaches Wikus' wife and Smit's daughter Tania, claiming Wikus is a wanted fugitive who has contracted a contagious disease from copulating with aliens. Wikus takes refuge in District 9, finding Christopher and the spaceship's concealed command module dropship underneath his house. Christopher explains to Wikus the confiscated fuel is crucial to his plan of reactivating the dropship, and if he can get them in the dropship to the mothership he can cure Wikus. Wikus attempts to acquire weapons from the District 9 Nigerian arms dealer Obesandjo, who wants to eat Wikus's alien arm to gain alien abilities. Wikus, however, seizes an alien weapon and escapes...\n\nRotten Tomatoes consensus states, \"Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching, District 9 has action, imagination, and all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science-fiction classic.\" Sara Vilkomerson of The New York Observer wrote, \"District 9 is the most exciting science fiction movie to come along in ages; definitely the most thrilling film of the summer; and quite possibly the best film I've seen all year.\" Christy Lemire from the Associated Press was impressed by the plot and thematic content, claiming that \"District 9 has the aesthetic trappings of science fiction but it's really more of a character drama, an examination of how a man responds when he's forced to confront his identity during extraordinary circumstances.\" Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum described it as \"... madly original, cheekily political, [and] altogether exciting ...\" Roger Ebert praised the film for \"giving us aliens to remind us not everyone who comes in a spaceship need to be angelic, octopod or stainless steel\", but complained that \"the third act is disappointing, involving standard shoot-out action. No attempt is made to resolve the situation, and if that's a happy ending, I've seen happier. Despite its creativity, the film remains space opera and avoids the higher realms of science-fiction.\" Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend says the film is unique in interpretation and execution, but considers it to be a knockoff of the 1988 film Alien Nation.\n\n\"District 9\" is a great, gritty, fresh and realistic sci-fi drama with touchpoints on how mankind has treated certain groups of people through history. Neil Blomkamp and the writers had Apartheid as an inspiration without no doubt. Sharlto Copley is great as Wikus van der Merwe and I love the documentary style the film has been produced and filmed in. It adds so much to the film. Yes, the CGI is not as good as it would´ve been if the film would be made today, but it´s ok. And yes, it does have a nod and a wink to \"Alien Nation\" from 1988. Nevertheless, \"District 9\" is entertaining, sad, funny and it leaves you with one or two thoughts. The film received acclaim from critics, who praised the film's direction, performances, themes, and story, with some calling it one of the best science fiction films of the 2000s, and garnered numerous awards and nominations, including four Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. The title is a nod to a real place and a real incident. District 6 was a mixed race neighborhood of Cape Town which the apartheid government demolished in 1966 to make room for whites.\n\nTrivia: Star Sharlto Copley had not acted before and had no intention of pursuing an acting career. He stumbled into the leading role as director Neill Blomkamp placed him on camera during the short film.",

            "content": "Great watch, will watch again, and highly recommended.\n\nThis has a wonderfully exciting premise: alien refugees on Terra, how Terrans react and how the aliens react.  The premise, as delivered, has some odd holes in though: it's specified that all of the crew have died, mysteriously, and no one knows how to operate the ship, but it's been in the air for some time.  The idea of gravity alone should have motivated Johannesburg to evacuate, but their government interaction seems decidedly weak.\n\nThe advantage of setting the story in South Africa, for an American audience, is that it's a very capitalistic society where they speak chiefly English: it's very similar to being set in Mexico and using Mexican Cartels instead of Nigerian gangs.\n\nSo if we accept that we haven't been able to extract an incident report, that we're not able to move the ship, and none of the xenos can move the ship, then the premise includes that one xenos knows what to do.  One would think that he just talks to someone and he gets all his people off planet, but since he's smart enough to do what he's been doing for 20 years, then he knows not to trust anyone.  But this self-serving principle is key to understanding character motivations going forward.\n\nThe writing in this is so good, along with the effects, and performance delivery.  As Vickis deals with his transformation, it prompts so many philosophical questions of what it is to be a person / human / xenos, a citizen, a government agent.  It also sort of resembles a gangsta / heist movie at parts, as opposed to a anti-government escapee.\n\nIf any of the deep stuff worried you, then be at ease that this movie has plenty of explosions, gunfire and sci-fi goodness.  It's also filled with some silly cliches that serve the points of the story, but there are several points in this movie that I have to shake my head at.  The motivations don't make sense unless you're reminded that everyone, including the protagonists, are (forced) in a self-serving mindset and it's about what they can do for themselves, even when working together with the contrast being, of course, that only when anyone is cooperating that anyone gets anywhere.\n\nThis is such a great watch, and if you like sci-fi styled stuff, and don't mind the South African setting (\"Chappie\" is another one), then definitely give this a watch.",

The concept is unique I'll give them that but besides that it's stupid. The whole human-alien intergration is ridiculous, and the idea that humans have learnt to understand alien is utter nonsense. The film is eventful with lots of action but it's low quality action. The main characters would have been killed in the gunfights, and Wikus wouldn't have been able to escape the facility in the first place. The whole turning into an alien thing was dumb as well considering the fluid was alien rocket fuel or whatever. I wasn't a fan of how weird the film was such as the eating catfood stuff and humans eating alien flesh, that just made things seem even more silly and unrealistic. The dialogue/writing was disappointing with most of what Wikus said being 'fock' and similar swear words in a weird accent. The actor's South African accent was ok at times though. However, there was no real background to any of the characters. They were all bland and have been done before - e.g. the typical power crazy military guy (just like in Avatar). Furthermore, the film made almost all the black characters savages and most of the white characters greedy psychopaths who completely disregarded human and alien life. The visual effects are below average especially compared to VFX standards today. The aliens are borderline acceptable but look completely fake, and the blood and weapon visual effects are very poor - more like a Corridor Crew video rather than a film. I understand this was made quite some time ago but when you compare these visual effects to something like LOTR (which this studio also did the VFX for) then it's a noticeable downgrade. The cinematography was fine but nothing special. The sound effects for the aliens were decent although kind of annoying, and the soundtrack was forgettable. Another film undeserving of its high ratings. If you want a proper film about aliens then watch Alien, Aliens, or ET.",

The first half is a setup for the real conflict that unfolds in an absolutely action-packed second half. The action just keeps coming, it doesn't stop. Visual effects are superb for the time and it's an astonishing true sight to behold. Sharlto Copley's performance is top-notch. The ending is really hard to forget. This film is undoubtedly a sci-fi masterpiece.",

            "content": "The found footage genre has produced many famous films with the success of The Blair Witch Project (1999) prompting many amateur filmmakers to believe that this sort of film was easy to make. While I am still dubious about whether the genre should be as wide ranging as it is this film is one of the better examples of the genre and is an antidote to some of the less intelligent science fiction films produced in the 2000s. I can't say that the film was made to appeal to me, in fact I am far outside of it's target audience, but I can admire the film in how well it is constructed and found it's story engaging and more entertaining than some of Neil Blomkamp's later work.\n\nIn the early 1980s in Johannesburg, South Africa a group of a million aliens, known as \"Prawns\", are found and they are placed in a detention camp known as \"District 9\" which rapidly becomes inhospitable. The government decides to have the aliens relocated by MNU, a large weapons manufacturing corporation, and the nebbish Wikus van de Merwe, Sharlto Copley, is hired to oversee this relocation. He is infected by the aliens and becomes a prawn himself and after escaping from a government lab where he would be harvested for experiments he is forced to become a fugitive. He is helped in District 9 by single father Christopher Johnson, Jason Cope, who states that the ship the prawns arrived in contains a fluid that can help turn him back into a human. The two men disagree over when van de Merwe will be cured as Johnson wants to be able to protect the prawns from the horrific experiments that are being conducted. This causes the two to grow apart and after making an irrational decision van de Merwe finds himself in the hands of the vicious Obesandjo, Eugene Khumbaniyiwa.\n\nIt was the film's first half that I found most interesting as the world that van de Merwe inhabits is set up well through fake newsreels and a documentary being shot explains everything to us. This is exposition of course but it is handled more delicately than it is in other parts of the film and the sly comments about immigration and the concern of South Africans about their conduct being the most deep exploration of the theme of xenophobia. It is not the fact that I really cared for van de Merwe or found myself laughing at the small jokes made but I was impressed by the fact that the film takes an outlandish concept and integrates it into a recognizable society effectively. \n\nThe disappointing second act of the film lets down what had been a decent first act as it becomes a generic action film and even the admittedly impressive special effects cannot salvage a poorly plotted tale. Where the film should have become even more introspective and gone further into van de Merwe's thoughts on his sudden transformation and the loss of connection with his wife it turns into a race to find resources and features several shootouts. If you have read any of my reviews you will know that I do not care for mindless fighting and explosions. The screenplay also makes for some weird moments as the villains deliver the most stereotypical ‘villain' lines that I have ever heard and the desperation that van de Merwe has is mostly seen through screaming and yelling not actions. The lack of variety in these scenes is annoying and everything quickly comes to feel redundant. Even the end of the film in which his wife finds a metal flower that he made and comes to believe that he is still alive and will come back to her is not as emotionally resonant as it should be.\n\nI wanted to stand up and cheer for this film because it is the rare science fiction film to receive a Best Picture nomination but I don't find it to be exceptional in any way. When 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Blade Runner (1982) were not able to wrangle Best Picture nominations it is sad that a movie like this was the one to make the breakthrough for it's genre.",

The main \"prawn\" character even has a rather normal name 'Christopher Johnson\" .. the relationship between him and his little alien son is strangely heart warming and sad. Especially when his son asks him about \"going home.\" \n\n...\nI highly recommend getting the blue ray and listen to the director's commentary for an in depth view. Its documentary style gives it a realistic feel. The gory scenes from the experimentation at the lab at MNU look gooey, nasty and gritty. We follow a MNU gov agent though. 'Wikus' Watching this man's journey keeps you on the edge of your seat. As we see him change and grip with the feelings of shame, and guilt as he sees what he has been apart of. Without realizing it. Seeing how the \"prawn\" aliens have been treated. They never chose to be here. He knows it. And we see at how MNU has treated them. And the lies we told them and ourselves. The very final scene leaves you feeling grey, somewhat in despair. Some feel the film could have done with a better score but this film being more documentary style in its cinematography I dont think really needed much in the way of music. (And I rarely say that.) Sometimes less is more. This film is a must watch for sci-fi fans and I reccomend everyone watch it at least once.\n\nMNU Instructional Voice:\n[in MNU Humvee] \"When dealing with aliens, try to be polite, but firm.

The main character did a good job, I felt bad for him for the stuff that came upon him. However, the movie does escalate really fast. I actually had to think for a second on what happened, but I was still very interested on what unfolded. There is a fair number of gun fights which really spiced up this Sci-Fi, very bloody and fast which I like.

And with a sharp vision as such, it is surprisingly layered and thoroughly calculated to be considered merely a summer blockbuster, there is too much art to be bent according to someone else's preference. Blomkamp doesn't suffer any fool, he is not ready to compromise and he ought not to. And despite of being plunged into a train of dark brutal images and theories for the dystopian future, his eye on tiny notions and details humanizes the perspective; the side effects caused by the parasite to the lead character like his hair loss or the vital roles that each character plays in the background.\n\nThe narration isn't hefty only to the material but to its characters too. The overly populated world is swooped across in this linear storytelling with skillful puppeteering by Blomkamp's execution. And just like the characters, the film keeps you busy with its competent and provocative nature of enfolding the screenplay with a loud ear ringing bang. Copley- both the well mannered obedient blind believer and the reckoning vigilante to the so called guardians of himself- is far more efficient as a follower than a leader.\n\nNevertheless with a range and power of character like such, his voice reaches individually as a performer. The supporting cast, if not extraordinary, stays to the marked timing as instructed. Blomkamp's world goes far wider than a mere district, taken account of all the possibilities, the script has managed to find its own adequate destination itself. The thrills of the chase and the sense of urgency is easily communicated with breathtaking sound effects and stunning visual effects, that paints quite a picture. District 9 is a forward pass to the sci-fi genre, not so lofty, not so cinematic, it is bitterly practical.",

You feel real emotions, the stakes are high. \n\nWhen I watch this movie, I believe it is exactly what humans would do to another species: mistreat them and look to steal their technology. \n\nSo much so that you root against the military state and for the aliens. Critics of the movie say that the hatred of the aliens feels contrived to fit the plot, but it is clearly explained that they have arrived at this place over a 20-year period. With nowhere to go, no jobs to work at, and an ever-increasing population, of course local humans would lose patience and demand relocation. Once the novelty of the aliens has worn off, the collective drains local resources with language barriers. \n\nThe final scenes are gut wrenching and brilliant. From the line \"don't make me come all this way and not make it\", the array of weapons unleashed by the suit, to the sounds the engines of the mother shop make when they fire for the first time in 20 years, to rooting for the pod to make it into the dock, it was raw emotion. \n\nWhile franchises like Marvel have their place and certainly make a lot of money, they feel polished and cookie cutter compared to something like this. Most of the time Hollywood just markets the same thing and sells that formula right back to you over and over (think the die in your arms scene), the kiss scene, the hero returns from the dead story-line. Not this movie. Things go wrong, aliens and humans get hurt, there are lies, on top of a the technology the alien race brings that is not so far fetched to believe. It doesn't have a happy ending where the main character is healed, and the aliens get to go home. No, the aliens are forced into a concentration camp, the main character is stuck on Earth indefinitely as a mutated alien, lost his wife, his family disowns him, MNU has egg on their faces for the street fight that has erupted. \n\nOne of a kind movie. An all-timer for me.",

This movie is also a great representation of human respect and how the blacks were treated before equal rights came in. It shows so well what power does to humans and affect show they treat others. Now to the review. At first, I had no interest in seeing this movie. I watched the trailer and saw that it was in document style filming. I hadn't seen this movie till early 2017. To be honest, I probably never would've watched it if it wasn't a class project. I regret that decision so much. I absolutely loved the style and technique of this film, and how Neil Blomkamp (Director) filmed this movie. This movie had such great emotion to it, it showed trust, betrayal, love, loyalty, and what it's like to be treated as scum of the Earth. I only really have a few nitpicks about this movie, but it's just my preferences. I found the shaky cam to get annoying sometimes and you also can't see what's fully going on a bit of the time because it is also so dark.

It supports an original premise, sort of, even if it does borrow from other films. I suppose my main issues with the movie are the characters and the unanswered questions. I didn't care about anyone in the movie, including the main character who we're meant to root for, despite the fact we saw him be a total arsehole about 10 minutes prior and also the fact that up until the last 10 minutes, he's in it for himself and himself only. Add that to unanswered conveniences that the movie just expects us to ignore (how do the aliens know how to speak our language, and vice versa? Why did the aliens come here? The list goes on). I'm torn on it, but feel that despite some good moments, the movie ultimately falls short. That being said, I know the movie gets a lot of love, so go check it out for yourselves and form your own opinion.",

            "content": "District 9 is considered by many to be the best recent occasion of having a sci-fi CLASSIC debuted. And it's something the genre and cinema as a whole hasn't endured in awhile since classics like Alien, Terminator, The Thing, The Fly, and many other films made by talented and pioneered filmmakers back in the day. Not only that, but it brought on South African Canadian director Neill Blomkamp into the Hollywood spotlight, though sadly suffered the 'M. Night Shyamalan Effect' (A occurrence to new or upcoming directors that start off on the right note, but get lost or dive away from what made their films enjoyable or interesting.) But anyways, after seeing this in cinemas and forgetting my initial thoughts on it i got a chance to re-watch it as of this writing. And how does it fair up after 7 years? It's pretty damn amazing. I'm lucky this film became the original sci-fi flick that it was rather than being a live-action video game adaptation to Halo that it was intended to be. Because if we had that, we wouldn't have something as gory, interesting, and original in a LONG time. While i did have issues with: often times nauseating but understandable shaky cam used in the action sequences, being too preachy on the spectrum of doing Alien Nations racism remarks on aliens in the film, and often cliche side or antagonistic characters, i can say these were issues that i picked up once i judged it after viewing. Meaning other than that, this film succeeds with FLYING colors everywhere else from: the gritty and grounded cinematography, nice homage to classic films like Aliens & Jon Carpenters The Fly, a cliche but effectively used racism message, a very atmospheric and well used soundtrack, superb acting from Shartlo Copley, the wonderfully used documentary style camerawork and framework that effectively paces the story, and of course it's interesting and very original approach to aliens visiting Earth that i think many people tend to overlook. So overall, go see this film if your big into innovative and original Sci-fi films. I had a blast re-watching this film and i can see why so many hold this as a classic for the ages.",

The problem for me was that I was not emotionally invested in any of the characters and the first act of the film dragged on for a very long time. Copley was good, but nothing outstanding. The segregation between humans and the \"Prawns\" is an obvious metaphor for diversity and whilst this drives the film, it perhaps forces this too much on the viewer. I can acknowledge that this is a very good film and can see why so many like it, it just didn't resonate with me as much.",
