            "content": "Watchmen is an ambitious project for anyone to undertake. The source material is complex, dense, and considered sacred by graphic novel fans the world over. Director Terry Gilliam once said that he could make a Watchmen film adaptation, but only if he was allowed a five-hour final cut. In this Zack Snyder version the story has been changed in order to fit it all into a more realistic timeframe for a modern film. The changes undoubtedly hurt the sophistication of the Alan Moore original work, but these changes are also fairly reasonable given the restrictions of cinema. Ultimately some of the nuance is sacrificed (apologies to the fans of The Black Freighter short located in between chapters of Moore's seminal work) in order to make the adjusted plot work. And it does work, mostly. There are a few scenes that linger too long and, considering what had to be cut, these scenes can be frustrating for fans of the graphic novel. But the character work is nearly flawless, which was a point that couldn't have been sacrificed due to how astoundingly human these superheroes are portrayed. The project oversees an alternate history wherein America won the Vietnam War due to the unstoppable force that is Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup). In this world superheroes had a golden era that has been recently thwarted by laws aimed at eliminating the practice altogether. When an old Vietnam War hero, known as the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), is thrown from his penthouse window a reluctant group of superheroes (team is the wrong word) investigates and finds a much bigger scheme in the works. Watchmen deconstructs the superhero motif with a bleak, gritty lens that would have been even more welcomed in this now Marvel-dominated world. Excellent turns by Matthew Goode, Patrick Wilson, and Jackie Earle Haley help sell this acceptable adaptation in a way that will impress the uninitiated and leave the hardcore fans only half-satisfied.",

This is not your average \"hero vs villain\" movie. This movie shows retired superheroes coming back together, to figure out who is after them, after Rorschach discovers a plot to kill all superheroes. This movie has so many turns, specifically emotional turns. From showing flashbacks to Rorschach's life as a kid, the reason he became a superhero to him being framed for a murder he did not do.

            "content": "This long-awaited, literal, virtually page-by-page adaptation of Alan Moore's mid-'80s series of graphic novels is certainly a vivid film experience. That's not to say it's a great film, though. After the heights reached by 'Spider-Man 2', 'Iron Man', and 'The Dark Knight' in terms of the comic-book/superhero movie genre, this graphic novel doesn't translate to the screen as well as one might have hoped. That's no fault of the director, Zack Snyder. The film is absolutely gorgeous to look at in nearly every frame. Like 'Sin City' and Snyder's own '300' before it, it is essentially a graphic novel brought to life on the big screen. There are also some choice performances: Jackie Earle Haley is a fierce presence (with a Batman growl), Patrick Wilson plays the Nite Owl with shades of Clark Kent, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is so good you wish he had more screen time, and Malin Akerman is every fanboy's sexual desire, although she's more a striking model than an actress. Billy Crudup is just a canvas for the amazing effects of Dr. Manhattan. But like the graphic novel itself, 'Watchmen' is more interesting than entertaining or thrilling. Moore's epic 12-part series was Biblical, philosophical, political, and psychological. That's great and all, but it doesn't exactly equal a great film experience. Where '300' was a sensational, assaultive popcorn movie, Snyder and his crew go for a more ponderous and grim tone. He's almost too reverent to his source material, and this dense 163-minute movie is a lot to take in. Between the brief bursts of action the material gives us plenty to think about, but never matches 'The Dark Knight' for that brilliant collision of thematic contemplation and thrilling pop entertainment. It may have to do with Moore's work, which, while often thought-provoking, doesn't translate to the screen as well as, say, Frank Miller's work does. His stories (he also wrote 'V for Vendetta') are more digestible on the page than on celluloid. Snyder does bring a pop-cultural sensibility to this film, with bad impersonations abounding (Nixon, Ted Koppel, and Pat Buchanan, among others) and classic pop tunes on the soundtrack. Yet despite its ambitions and superlative production values, the best one can say about Snyder's adaptation is that he did what no one before him could do--he got this \"un-filmable\" comic made. Will I want to see this again? Probably not before I watch 'The Dark Knight' for the 50th time",

Crudup's Dr. Manhattan just sounded sad when he really needed to sound dispassionate with a hint of childlike wonder (something perfectly captured in the HBO version). Dan Dreiberg needed to be frumpier. Laurie was annoying and upbeat rather than bitter and disaffected (also perfectly captured in the HBO version). Veidt‚Ä¶ ugh‚Ä¶ I doubt anyone picture him looking (too lanky) or sounding like this guy (again, his comically arrogant personality is better captured in the HBO version, although Jeremy Irons voice takes a minute to get used to). Nixon is ok. The rest of the supplemental characters are just ok, but don't really fly off the pages or make a big impact. Hooded Justice does makes an impression. And then with Adrian's hybrid cat it seemed like they embarrassed to feature it prominently in any scene because of the mediocre CGI.\n\nYou can quibble over casting decisions, but the real cardinal sin of this movie, which is surprising considering all the they clearly labored to recreate, was the reinvention of Veidt plan. Zack Snyder thought it would look stupid (the first time he's cared about something looking stupid) to have a giant squid on screen. So, instead, he haphazardly undermined the logic of the plan (i.e. get the world to drop the Cold War to focus on the potential of another \"alien\" attack) replacing it with a preposterous one (i.e. get the world to think that it can band together against a nigh-omniscient, nigh-omnipotent being who can foresee your actions and can snap you out of existing with a single infinity stone). Not sure if it was studio pressure, or if all the stupid falls on Snyder, but preserving this one plot point might have made this a 4-star movie (albeit one with wooden acting, too much slow-mo, and none of the crooked vibrant feel of the comic).\n\nIf you're reading this, you probably already know that the Damon Lindelof series is everything this movie could have been (and more!), but on the off chance that you ignored the spoiler warning: go watch the series right now. It's so faithful to the feeling you get from read the original. And even if Alan Moore hates it, he has reason to hate it just a little bit less than all the other adaptations of his work. And I blame Zack Snyder for giving Moore more reasons to distrust Hollywood with his creations.",

            "content": "The graphic novel source material is a masterpiece, bold, uncompromising, subtle, witty, imaginative with very unique characters and an immersive world. Albeit one that is near-unfilmable, with the themes, the huge amount of content and the amount of depth needed, a three hour film sounded nowhere near enough on paper. Plus Zack Snyder is nowhere near close to being a favourite of mine, but saw 'Watchmen' anyway because of my love for the source material, that it looked fantastic and because the cast are very talented.\n\n'Watchmen' really is well worth your time. More the director's cut though than the theatrical release, though both versions have the exact same brilliant qualities. Of which there are many in 'Watchmen'. It is a prime example of how to transcribe a graphic novel to film, while not being as good and not having everything there, and still be near-great on its own terms. It is by far Snyder's best film in my view, as well as being his most mature and ambitious, being the only one to be above good and be more than style over substance. His other films left me mixed to indifferent.\n\nIs 'Watchmen' perfect? No. It does feature one of the most uncomfortable-feeling and pointless love scenes on film, and Leonard Cohen (well certainly for the song in question, it is a great song that is not well used) has never been used more awkwardly in visual media in my view (partly because in my opinion it doesn't fit with the context of the scene).\n\nMatthew Goode is also a bit too stiff and subdued as Ozymandias. Actually do prefer Jeremy Irons' more eccentric and all out portrayal in the recent series, despite the character being a lot less puzzling here. So it is easy to see why 'Watchmen' is a divisive film, though more for its heavy, polarising themes, the huge length (that sounds overlong on paper), that figuring out what's going on admittedly is not easy for anybody who is not familiar with the graphic novel and it seems that the ending has left people divided (the ending in the source material sparks much debate as well).\n\nFor all of the flaws mentioned, so much works in 'Watchmen's' favour. It looks amazing for one thing. Very stylish and imaginative with some incredible special effects, there is nowhere near as much gratuitous slow-motion here than seen in some of Snyder's other work. The opening sequence is absolutely amazing in as jaw-dropping a way as you can get, what a way to start a film. The music is nostalgic and atmospheric, with mostly inspired use of great songs. Only the Cohen song in the scene in question is questionable. Snyder's direction is some of his most ambitious and doesn't try to do too much to the same extent as his other films.\n\nMoreover, the script compels, flows naturally and raises interesting ideas that provokes thought, managing not to trivialise its difficult content. A good deal of talk but not too exposition-heavy, even when focused on Dr Manhattan in the middle act. There is not much subtlety here, Snyder and subtlety never belonged in the same sentence, but the ironic wit translates well to film from the graphic novel as does the maturity. The length is a long one, but the source material is massive so the film really needed to be long. If anything, in terms of adapting it would be better a mini-series. The story makes the most of getting one immersed in an authentically rendered world, and thematically it is bold and executed in an unforgivably uncompromising approach as ought. The violence shocks but didn't come over as gratuitous and the action thrills. Didn't have much of a problem with the ending, but can see why others would, the climax is thrillingly staged at least.\n\nA good job is done with the characters, though Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias is underused and a bit underdeveloped. Night Owl and in particular Rorschach being the standouts, though The Comedian is also a difficult role to pull off. Apart from reservations with Goode, the performances are strong. Jackie Earle Haley is perfect casting as Rorschach, and have no qualms with Billy Crudup, Patrick Wilson and Jeffrey Dean Morgan either. The most difficult roles, pulled off beautifully.\n\nOverall, very good and nearly great, with a lot done extremely well with a couple of misgivings. The polarisation is understandable but the appeal is even more so. The recent adaptation, despite getting a lot of over the top hate very prematurely into its run is also worth seeing. It is a slow starter and ends anti-climactically but there is so much brilliant about it, and if one sticks with it if put off by the first couple of episodes it to me and others got a lot better. 8/10",

            "content": "I learnt about Watchmen when I was in my first year at college. One of my friends had recently received the graphic novel as a present and he would often bring it. I was curious to know what the graphic novel was about, so I looked it up, and that's how I discovered this movie. I wasn't much into superhero genre before this, so I decided to take a look at it. Back then I thought this was a great story, and after having read the original graphic novel, I think it's a great adaptation.\n\nIn the opening scenes the Minutemen are summarised with the song \"For the times they are a-changin'\" playing in the background. It was so cool to watch. It doesn't matter whether you like Zack Snyder's movies or not. One thing you do have to admit is that his opening scenes are always awesome. And this one is the one that absolutely nails it.\n\nThe costumes have been made either very faithful to the comic book counterparts like those of Silk Spectre II and The Comedian, or have been improvised as in the case of Ozymandias and Night Owl II. Dr Manhattan's \"thing\" is surely a bit distracting, but I was able to ignore it after a while. Rorschach was my favourite character in this movie. The one criticism this movie gets is that he was portrayed to be a badass dude instead of a self centred hypocrite that he was in the graphic novel, and I completely understand this. But I also like this interpretation. Since most of the story is centred over Rorschach figuring out about The Comedian's death, he has to look as interesting as possible in order to keep the audience engaged.\n\nAnother criticism this movie often gets is that it was unable to capture the visual essense of the graphic novel, which I completely disagree with. The graphic novel has an 80's styled drawing. Why would you want this movie to be made with that style? It is a good thing that this movie didn't go for the same visual style. This criticism is the equivalent of \"why Wolverine doesn't wear his comic book costume in the movies\". Dude things have to be changed in order to be adapted on the big screen. It's also the reason why the giant squid was replaced with a nuclear bomb. A giant squid sounds very funny instead of serious. No country would take any big action in case that happens.\n\nIf you're watching this movie for the first time, I'd say you should try the Director's Cut first. If you have no problem with the length of the movie and you can see and understand everything that you see in complicated movies, I'd say you should go with the Ultimate Cut. I watched the Ultimate Cut. Initially I was bored because of how the story was dragging on, but slowly everything started to make sense. I really like all the action scenes in this movie, and often go back to watching it just for the old time's sake.",

It terms of darkness it was leading the way in 2009.  Think 'The Joker' but split over a few characters.  Every character except the owl dude is emotionally challenged in some way, it's hard to call anyone in the film a hero as they are all just acting according to their world view.  If my favorite character who wasn't particularly strong, didn't have a lot of gadgets, but was just trying to be just in his own violent way hadn't got killed by the most OP person in the film, who had as much charisma as a cardboard cut out, I'd have given it 5 stars.\nIt's a hardcore hero film, that asks a lot of morale questions, it's also 3 hours long so not for the feint hearted.  At least you get enough flash backs that explain their past to get you invested in the characters.  Shame my second favorite character pretty much was dead at the start.

The movie is very long and most of the time it is just the origin story of various characters, some more interesting than others.

A long film, almost three hours, which didn't seem long. It did threaten at one point to turn into a who-dunnit but the endings, yes, both of them ! were stunning and fooled me completely.

Watchmen is about how pathetic and dangerous superheroes could be if they existed, while this movie (like everything Snyder does) just glorifies and celebrates psychopathic anti-heroes.

He proves he can't tell a story once again, and he would go on to fail at telling stories for many (failed) franchises to come! That's okay though, what the studio has to know is that it's all about the 3 hour director's cuts with Snyder. You make all the money later, when fans complain and want his cut of the movie and not the guy who you replaced him with. Watchmen only had like 2 or 3 director's cuts, and I think I watched the theatrical cut on HBO. Why does HBO have such bad playback? What do I pay them for? Why does the screen get stuck on a big blue phallus? This movie had great casting, except for if I had casted it I would re-case everyone except Rorschach. It's only because this is movie for comics geeks that bland actors who are mainly on tv now had to play everyone. It would also have been better if they used one of the blue man group for Dr. Manhattan because less $ on CGI, and the character would be more realistic looking and relatable with respect to what he's packing. How does Silk Spectre wind up with Nite Owl after having gotten with Dr. Manhattan, he was such a freak! He was cold and emotionally distant, it was cool.",

My only main issue is that there are times where the movie gets so sidetracked by the origins stories of the protagonists, I'm looking at you Dr Manhattan, that it interupts the flow of the movie to such an extent that the ending feels nowhere near as impactful as it could have been. The graphic novels I imagine handle this much better as they have more time, and I would have happily sat through an extra half an hour if it meant a more well rounded movie.

The song doesn't make you feel sad at all, all it does, is that it makes you feel the complete opposite. It makes you laugh instead of feel upset, the reason being for this is because on how much it's been memed to death, lol.\n\nOverall, Watchmen is a brilliant movie. The movie's got an amazing plot twist, pretty solid acting, great dialogue, very graphic and brutal action sequences. \n\nThe movie's also got some pretty good cinematography and it's even got a great soundtrack.

O filme, na sua vers√£o Ultimate Cut, tem mais de 3h30 de dura√ß√£o, por√©m, com um enredo t√£o bem amarrado e constru√≠do, parece um filme de 2h e olhe l√°.

It' on of the most faithful comic adaptations you can watch, so much so, Snyder used the original comic as storyboard for this project. Yes, he took some liberties, especially near the end, removing the alien squid completely, and definitely overused slow-mo, but overall, I love this adaptation. It's stylish, dark, violent and vulgar. Oh, and both Comedian and Rorschach have been perfectly casted.",

I definitely wasn't disappointed. I enjoyed the acting quite a bit (though several of the actors didn't quite fit the part for me). I don't think I would have understood a lot of the depth of this movie without having first read Watchmen. A lot of the finer details were either vaguely addressed or felt rushed past entirely. The person I was watching it with was confused more than once and needed something explained during a pause.\n\nI loved the setting here, I felt the director did an amazing job capturing the bleakness that saturates this world.

Its narrative was always going to be extremely difficult to tell in a solid yet compelling manner, and Zack Snyder does struggle with balancing all of the storylines and its characters. However, he and his phenomenal team still delivered a good flick. Technically sublime, with a distinct style, brilliant production design, and gorgeous cinematography. Characters like Rorschach and Nite Owl have amazing moments, filled with excellent action sequences, but also with emotionally powerful scenes. If it could be better? Maybe. If it could be split into two or three movies. As it stands, as one and only film, it's really impressive even with its flaws.\"",

The acting is top-notch (especially Jackie Earl Haley as Rorschach, Patrick Wilson as Niteowl II and  Jeffrey-Dean Morgan in the very few scenes he's in as The Comedian), the visuals are stunning to look at and I can safely say that Ozymandias is a rather underrated villain. I'm hyped for the Watchmen TV show.\nOne little warning though. This movie may not be for everyone. Again, it's VERY faithful to the source material, so not many people would understand this movie or even like it as much. Even so, I still recommend this movie at least for a watch.

A dark, almost dystopian atmosphere around scenery that is usually quite familiar to the eye. The best example of this would definetly be his 2007 film 300. Why? Well other than style, films usually require some substance aka story. 300 didn't generally need that. It was an action-heavy, testosterone-filled film whose plot just involved Gerard Butler stabbing Persians. Here Snyder was tasked with doing the opposite. And that was the main problem that plagued this film. It struggled considerably to bring Moore's complex narrative to life. It just does not feel cohesive. We jump from scene to scene along different plotlines but, again, with little visible cohesion. As a result the pacing drags quite a bit over it's mammoth, almost three hour runtime. With that being said I actually had quite a lot of fun with this movie. Snyder absolutly nails the style of this alternate New York. It feels very run-down and wounded. Also it deals excellently with Moore's themes of morality. The Watchmen, particularly, feel like The Avengers if they went just a step too far. Rorschach, who is the closest to being a main character, is basically what Batman would be if he had decided to start killing his enemies. The last twenty or so minutes of the film showcase the challenging morality of certain character choices brilliantly and I'd argue that is the movie's high point. Definitely a polarizing film. It's a 3 for me.",

It DOES make more sense the second time around, although for a superhero movie, it still has a complex plot.\nPROS: it is almost more of a noir who-done-it mashed up with superheros.  It kind of works either way.  It is very well filmed with lots of Snyder slow-motion violence.  Haley's performance as Rorschach is mesmerizing to watch especially without the mask - almost to the point that every cut away from him made me go 'hey!'  I also though they did a great job at looking at what life would be like as a superhero.  The family squabbles, retirement, how does the end come for a superhero?\nCONS: it is drab, dreary, and not much ACTUAL plot actually happens.  The who-done-it plot gets lost in all the gee whiz CGI and costumes and flashbacks, and by the time it all gets solved and blurted out in like 2 minutes at the end, it seems almost a throw away.  I knew who the bad guy was on the second viewing, but for the life of me I couldn't remember any of the why or how because it meant so little the first time.\n\tThis whole story also would have been WAY more effective if it had been filmed before the end of the Cold War.  Looking back from almost 20 years on in an alternative timeline, the threat of nuclear war seems less compelling (although maybe it shouldn't), and Nixon as the bad guy is so passe, as well as how many moviegoers even have a visceral memory of Nixon?\n\tAnd what is with Dr Manhatten's ding dong?  If he can recreate himself from pure energy, you would think he would either go total Ken-doll, or if he felt inadequate, make it really huge.  Or wear his occasional space-speedo.

            "content": "Watchmen was a socially-relevant, very gritty graphic novel from the late 80s written by one of the most original comic book writers of the time (or any time), Alan Moore.\n\nMany of Alan's books have been made into movies. From Hell. V for Vendetta. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. And he refuses to put his name on any of them because he thinks movies are pointless drivel.\n\nSo, for over 20 years, people have been trying to prove Alan wrong and find a way to put his \"masterpiece,\" Watchmen, into film form. And no one had the balls, or technology, to accomplish it. \n\nUntil now.\n\nFirst off, Zack Snyder has done the PERFECT translation of Watchmen into film. There is no way it could have ever been done better. Ever. By anyone. \n\nHowever, that still doesn't mean the book translates to film well. It doesn't. At all. \n\nZack is very aware of how much it is possible to forever ruin Watchmen by making it into a cheesy movie, so he sticks to the source material almost verbatim. This makes for an interesting viewing experience, if you've read the book. It's like the book is being read to you.\n\nHowever, it's like the book is being read to you.\n\nIt doesn't have a movie flow. It has a book flow. The film struggles to emotionally connect you with any character, except for Rorschach, who is the highlight of the film. PERFECT casting. And being so distant from the era of the cold war, even though we are seeing hints of it again, it's incredibly difficult to feel what the book made readers feel in the 80s when the cold war was so prevalent.\n\nFrom the perspective of being faithful to the book, Zack should be commended and, in that respect, the film is perfect, even if they replaced the giant squid with nuclear explosions. It's a 5 star film.\n\nHowever, from a film-watcher's perspective, it was too long (and, yes, I realize it had to be), it was too dated (and, yes, I realize it had to be), it was too boring and it did not flow well at all, though I think it picked up in the last half hour. \n\nIf you were a fan of the book, you HAVE to see it. If you have no idea about the book, do not waste your 3 hours and $15.\n\nSide note: I was a huge comic book reader in the 1980s. What made Watchmen important was that, at the time, in the era of Ronald Reagan and the Cold War, what was weird was that comic book writers would not tackle the subject of nuclear war. It was almost like a silent rule that even though super heroes are supposed to save us from everything, we all know writing that a super hero could stop nuclear war is just dumb and unrealistic (even though the concept of super heroes themselves is dumb and unrealistic). It was very strange. Since no one could figure out a way to have a hero stop EVERY nuclear missile before hitting their targets, they just avoided the subject. \n\nSo when Alan Moore decided to tackle the subject head-on, he did it in a very unique way, and probably the only way it would have made sense. In Watchmen, the heroes manipulated mankind from destroying themselves. THAT is the way they saved them. They brought them together by making a common enemy from which they could unite. The heroes didn't have to \"stop all the bombs.\" They simply had to manipulate the leaders from ever wanting to release the bombs. \n\nIt was genius. \n\nAlan's disgust of the government, status quo, etc., and his story's descent into chaos are themes in many of Alan's stories. V for Vendetta is another great example (and much better done film). He is a master storyteller though, and superb character developer. Rorschach, in particular, comes across to me as Alan himself, which is why I think the character appeals to the reader so much. Uncompromising and blunt, like Alan himself.",

It offers nice visuals and performances from the main cast, but the film caters too much on each character's backstories rather than focusing onto the main plot. However, once it does, you will be already too bored to care. If the film was shorter and leaner, then the film would have suffice. Not all adapted movies benefited from its source material.

Watchmen 2009 was a brilliant and beautiful masterpiece well written and slightly modified from the comic book to match the show time and to adopt the current audience's taste much like Batman Begin where it is not completely true nor accurate to the comic book but it was done so for modern era. The difference would be that unlike Watchmen, Batman has infinite number of different continuity that allow the director to play around with while Watchmen do not. The Watchmen film ending especially is very different from the comic book where in the comic, giant squid like monster attack the city but in the film that part has been removed completely to avoid the audience confused. The lighting, camera angle, tempo and storytelling was beautiful. Due to the story flashing in and out from past to present, it may confuse some audience but it never bothered me at the slightest. Though many audience and critics do complain that the film version do not adopt some part of the comic book however, they lack the fact that the format for comic book and film are completely different and different media requires different decision making to execute the best. The film is designed to best bringing in the Watchmen story without diluting or over flooding or wasting audience time by adding another few hours to the story telling. If this film was a trilogy or sort to contain every aspect of the comic book, then it might of received a higher rating but again that is not how critic or fans should review a film. Every film is contained to its own story unless it has a sequel and this film, Watchmen has done everything a director can to summarize the legendary comic book into one short film. I have not discussed about the characters or actors since they all have done a brilliant job and only add so much to the film.

Many believe that Sucker Punch was the only genuinely bad movie he made. And then there's Watchmen. It was also polarizing but it's the one Zack Snyder movie that many believe to be legitimately good. Everyone has their own criticisms: the long runtime, the narrative structure and Dr. Manhattan's blue ding-dong. However, on most sties that aren't review aggregators, you'll find a decent amount of people claiming that Watchmen should be among the Top 10 best superhero movies of all time. Which side of the spectrum do I fall on? Well, I'm sure the number of stars I've given this movie isn't giving you a straightforward answer. From what I heard, the movie is faithful to the comic so that ought to please fans of the Alan Moore classic. I really liked what this movie had to offer. The performances, the characters, the line delivery of Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan especially during the scenes where we hear their thoughts. The special effects look amazing and no matter which side of the spectrum you take you'll find yourself unable to disagree with how amazing the visuals and effects look. The action? There is action but most of it is brief and the action sequences often don't reach the five-minute mark. Zack Snyder's signature style still appears in them. Then there's the amazing opening credits montage. And the ending, too. Take note that Zack Snyder was making a movie that puts the characters first and the action later and that violence isn't something casually glossed over because they were evil. This is why the movie had to be rated R. Because PG-13 wouldn't be suitable for a movie based off of such a complex comic. Even if you didn't like Watchmen there are far worse comic book movies than it. I thought this movie was awesome.",

Jackie Earle Haley steals the show as Rorschach, somehow managing to be more emotive with the mask than without it, and his performance is so great that I forgive him for failing as Freddy Krueger in the 2010 remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street. Matthew Goode is fantastic, and his performance makes Ozymandias one of the most underrated villains in cinematic history. Billy Crudup is perfectly detached as Dr Manhattan, Patrick Wilson is criminally underrated as Nite Owl, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan absolutely nails his performance as The Comedian. There's not as much action as you'd expect from a 163 minute long movie, but the action itself is fun, entertaining, and brutal. Zack Snyder's direction isn't fantastic, but he does a very good job. I haven't read the graphic novel, so I can't comment on its faithfulness, but the film stands very well on its own.

When we see that there is plenty to hide from when our pasts are not as squeeky clean as our image may be. When we see a time where we got our beginnings that we didn't need to hide behind fear and take a stand to what we believe in, justice. When we see the world is what it is globally captivating us to our tvs, and ears that we can't hide what our actions do and whom to blame. When we see clearly the world is what it is when we have the right to be hidden from the world and not fear of being watched to restore order, we just escalated it. When we see that being human we have immoral thoughts, actions, and deeper feelings that shouldn't be judged when being human is similar to those who are superhuman. When we see we can't hide who we are by wearing masks, so that we remain transparent to society we belong in to be judged equally as others. When we see no one is above the law, that no one can't hide from it to only choose to remain visible or hidden away from the public eye. When we see not everyone can hide when their existence is the problem and solution when they are seen as a weapon and peacekeeper but standing alongside 1 and not all that others refuse to hide in fear of one day falling to a super power that war is the answer. When we see that much is needed to gain peace when we only get to see the causes and effects of war serves to us on tv but not everything is revealled when decisions are made hidden in well kept doors away from public eyes and ears to know what goes on. When we see that we can hide what we want but can't hide how we get it. When we see that we all have greater deeper yearnings that we keep hidden whether it's our humanly urges, greater purpose to do right, fight for the weak & small, moral obligation, truth in the face of darkness and to feel wanted again we keep hidden but it surfaces in our actions and eye to do good. When we don't see how much human we truly are at times but we hide it when we are too superhuman, that we remain in another state of mind then the human kind to notice what we lost. When we see what others can't see that we explore deeper and further then others couldn't possibly do when we live in a world where it's hidden in plain sight to notice whether it is underneath us, above us or all around us we can't see. When we see that there is plenty to see but nobody wants to see us again, we disappear for good and remain hidden. When we don't see all what remains hidden in society that makes it unclean and dirty that we need to bring out in the surface and end it's days of being hidden. When we see that not all things in life is meant to be not hidden when it's personal. When we see that we are the true reasons as to why there is so much no peace that we choose to ignore and remain hidden for the fear of knowing is the worst part that eliminates what we always thought we were seeing in ourselves being a symbol for good. When we see or font see things we don't know because it's hidden from us or kept a secret from us  for own good or for people's own good that we now know we must have. When we see that making some truths hidden is the answer we need in times to restore peace in times where there is no other resolution, but it comes st the costs of others including ourselves that we must remain hidden. When we see that we always hated hiding or remain dishonest and out casted that it stands for everything we fight for that we can't hide and live a lie like others can when the world means more to us then superficiality but the order in which it is founded on. When we see that once we see something now it's no longer what we see when it's now deformed and nobody can't see when it is hidden in the illusion we make it to be. When we see that we don't need to be seen to make a difference for peace when our words, eyes and story is enough to paint the picture of what others see to judge for themselves and not be scared to express what they feel from being hidden and challenge what we see and always fight for what we believe the truth will set us free to break free from illusion.",

Snyder tries hard to recreate the style and look of the world, while missing the ultimate point of Moore's pessimism and criticism of humanity.  He also accentuated the most obvious aspects of the book (the shock value, the character study that seemed much deeper when it was subtle) and made the casting an absolute parody, worthy of Mad TV.  I say this as a person who loved the comic, loved the idea of a movie finally being made, and as a Watchmen patriot who still feels obligated to support what is probably the only film version that will try to get it right - and (barely) succeed.",

            "content": "Bravo, solemn and stirring, sublime, to name a few, that this movie was up to. Watchmen, beginning with death of Comedian, a grandiosity, as well as a bombshell which the movie drops from the very beginning, successfully leading us to the dark world disarrayed by all kinds of live stuff that mixed up with the dirty city which seems to fall together along with his body and his badge from the height. Through one eye of that smiling face, the film shows us a large quantity of history stories, including some important moments such as the surrender of Japs, the assassination of president Kennedy (by Comedian), all of these was accompanied by that famous song called 'for the times they are a-changing', you many feel that nothing was left behind. Indeed, this kind of head leader was never made before, and probably will be unique for a very long time.\n\nAs the investigation into the real murder who committed to the death of Comedian, Rorschach kept warning his old friends, or his comrade-in-arms for old times' sake, other guys seemed to be, however, not quite shocked. Actually, they had plenty of reasons to be, after all, this world has been lousy and hurly-burly for a long goddamn time, dwellers crawled   over the surface of this city, those who used to be heroes fell from grace. To them, it was just an ordinary murder case. Switch to another line, Nuclear Crisis between two superpowers: America and Soviet grew as time went by. How to keep people's head above water and save this world from that unimaginable calamity, no one had a clear view except one watchman: Ozymandias, who later neutralized that crisis by imputing the explosion to Doctor Manhattan.\nSo we can see it: this movie had a simple story: heroes finally saved the entire human race by using some tricks, although brought some burdens to bear. This movie, however, is quite more complicated, it definitely confuses you if you did not read the comic before, but how involuted does this film will be? Let's just say: it is quite meaningless to make a pectination to the contents here.\n\nApparently, this film seems to be an heroes film, but it tramples them, blames them and cast them into hell. Among these guys, two who always stuck to their rules and followed their own principle: Comedian and Rorschach, died miserably, two were killed by other members, which is exceeding ironical. And, again, their death was caused by not changing their credendum. Other heroes, Owlman and Silk Spectre lived their own ordinary life as usual routine, some occasional good deeds to help people was just a kind of reminiscence they made in order to recall their activities in olden days. Doctor Manhattan, he could not even emancipate himself from old times. Ozymandias, the smartest guy in the planet, did not have a real ability to save the human while not victimizing some in this world. No one was perfect in this universe, but the real bad dudes never exits. Be that as it may, they never stop redeeming themselves, but they never really made that achievement. The world was saved, but who else can save these super heroes ? At least I figure time has no such power here.\n\nDarker than The Dark Knight, Acomplicated as it can be, As much information as it can delivered us.\n\nThe director: Zack Snyder complete an impossible mission: filmizing a comic called Watchmen.",

            "content": "My first impression of Watchmen came before the DC \"Extended Universe\" was underway. I had never read the graphic novel (still haven't). But I did like the comics genre, and director Zack Snyder had done something interesting with 300. So I gave Watchmen a shot and was ... unimpressed.\nI didn't hate it. I didn't love it. I probably would have forgotten it. But now a Watchmen TV show is in the works, Zack Snyder is a (much criticized, often unfairly) driving force in the DCEU, and the Watchmen are back in the comics scene. It seemed like a good time for a second screening. \nOn the surface, there's a lot to appreciate here. It's lovingly crafted by filmmakers with a passion for the source material. It has massive attention to detail. It's visually inventive. If it were about characters we knew and loved, it might nothing short of epic.\nAnd it is epic in scope, but not in impact. We're thrown into an alternate reality where superheroes are real and even helped win the Vietnam war. As the President who won that war, Richard Nixon is in his fifth term. Superheroes, however, are outlawed, except for Dr. Manhattan, who replaces \"Mutual Assured Destruction\" to keep the cold war from turning hot. \nThe movie is also epic in length, and begins to feel a little self-indulgent. We get flashbacks and backstories from the 40's to the 70's before we really even understand the alternate 80's we've been thrown into. Sometimes it takes a moment to discern whether a scene is flashing back or moving forward. Maybe it would help if you're familiar with the graphic novel, but the narrative structure is just not going to work for everyone.\nWatchmen preceded Deadpool and Logan on the R-rated comic book front, and earns the R with violence, sex, nudity and language. But in Watchmen, the R-rated content isn't for laughs, and sometimes it's a bit uncomfortable. \nIn fact, it's hard to find sensibilities with which to get comfortable in this movie. These are all anti-heroes, without a single character in the film to latch onto as a virtuous hero just trying to do the right thing. Several of the heroes are straight up killers. One is an attempted rapist. The movie's primary love story is an adultery tinged triangle.\nDespite dealing with Vietnam, Richard Nixon and the Cold War, the politics are similarly non-committal. No one's particularly wrong or right. The end justifies the means in a world where you must do terrible things to stave off even worse things. That world is part of what makes it difficult to connect with the film. Written just a year before Ronald Reagan's \"tear down that wall\" ultimatum, Watchmen was written in a world that knew all too well the existential threat of nuclear war with the Soviets. As such, Watchmen is adapting a story which cannot be told apart from the sensibilities of those who lived through the 60's, 70's and 80's. Perhaps the very themes that made Watchmen resonate so powerfully  with readers in 1986, make it difficult to connect with today.  \nMany people, perhaps most, will find Watchmen inaccessible. But maybe it's unfair to criticize it for having an unconventional structure or pace. Zack Snyder wasn't trying to make a conventional movie. He was trying to adapt a specific piece of pop culture, one many had called \"unfilmable,\" to the silver screen. The late Roger Ebert said that he rated a movie based on whether it succeeded in what it was trying to do. By that measure, Watchmen may be very successful (and Ebert did give it four stars).\nPerhaps if Zack Snyder's other movies were rated in this spirit, his DCEU movies would fare better with the critics.",

Not only is it visually striking and aurally brilliant, but I really enjoyed how Snyder paced and told the story and characters. I felt that despite not knowing anything from the source material, I got to know these characters reasonably well. There are some grand moments of action and Snyder shoots these with style and composure, never becoming over the top or confusing. He keeps the actions steady and focused. He tells the story well and gives ample back story to the main characters. And he does it with clarity and balanced pacing. I cannot begin to describe here how surprised I was that this film more or less nailed it for me from an entertaining perspective. The dark tone and very human qualities of the vilgilantes makes them very believable. The script is very tight and some parts are fairly profound but never too deep or pretentious. It simply strikes the right balance. This is possibly the best super hero/villain film I've ever seen, and it is without a doubt Snyder's best film to date. Rorschach was my favourite character. Not only is he badass, but he's the purest of them all, maintaining an inviolable principle of justice in the face of anything and everything. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommend. 5/5*",

            "content": "WHAT I LIKED: Zack Snyder's 'Watchmen' is appealing for a number of reasons, but what makes it stand out amongst his filmography is how appropriately silly it is. Indeed unlike some of his more \"ambitious\" efforts, there's no over-egging going on here, and you get the sense it doesn't take itself too seriously for its level of sophistication. As such, when Snyder does introduce themes in such a juvenile manor, it flips by in the quirky way you feel it's designed to, as opposed to a way that shoves it down your throat with a very serious-looking mallet. Outside of that though, what makes the whole experience not only bearable but also rather successful is the characterisation, as these are genuinely human, occasionally amusing and often layered individuals who you can actually form attachments to. Couple that with some goofy visuals and an iconic style and you've got yourself a film that you can most definitely smile at, if not largely enjoy.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Unfortunately, the amount of things Snyder tries to cram in here make it rather lengthy and extremely convoluted, and the way he delivers his themes is rather oddly comparable to the plot of 'Mamma Mia' - constantly going out of its way to allow characters to literally talk about the themes he wants to discuss, as opposed to letting it all organically flow and consequently play out properly. He may as well have let them sing about it.\nVERDICT: Snyder forces a narrative from getting characters to talk about the things he wants, but at least this time it's done in a way that will have you smiling rather than sleeping.",

Visually this film is brilliant and not just thanks to the special effects as the way the action is shot for instance is really well done and talking of the action it is brutal, hard hitting, gloriously violent and in parts entertaining. The soundtrack is also great, nice mix of well known pop and rock songs mixed with classical music which does overshadow the score which though decent isn't all that memorable. The plot is solid enough and the script although serviceable and having mostly decent dialogue doesn't really delve deep into these characters which given the runtime is a wasted opportunity.

Zack Snyder has an extremely dark vision when it comes to movies, especially comic book movies. Man Of Steel was really dark and gritty as well as Batman v Superman, which was dark, gritty, and dull all at the same time. 300 was bland, it had great cinematography that was immersive, but the film overall wasn't too good. Watchmen has gained a cult following along the way. Back in 2009, fans of the beloved Graphic Novel were super excited for finally see an adaption to Watchmen. It took many years for a Watchmen movie due to many creative difference by filmmakers, crew members dropping out of the production, the CGI being way to advanced for its time that it couldn't be done, and there were many directors that signed on to make the movie, but left afterwards. Snyder is all about style over substance that's why most of his movies feel so immersive yet story wise they're bad. Snyder also writes the movies that he directs, when watching those films you can absolutely tell that you are watching a Zack Snyder picture. Watchmen is probably one of the best examples of a Zack Snyder film. The story is interesting, but is really confusing. It's also overbearing long and slow. It has a gratitous amount of graphic explicit violence and gore, a strong erotic and really awkward sex scene, and an extensive amount of dark slow motion takes - that's Snyder for you. Watchmen is the prime example of it all. By the end of the movie, you don't feel good at all, you just feel like you finished witnessing a dark, stylish and brutal 2 hr and 40 min movie.",

Overall a nice movie but nothing special and nothing really negative to say. It appears Zack Snyder still can't make a movie with stable plot and coherent character in his movies.",

And things are always going to get worse before they get better. Despite differences from the original comic, it pulls it off quite well. My only big complaints are ones I have with the comic, but that would probably spoil too much of the movie. It's also true that I'd rather recommend the Director's Cut (I'd say 4.5 star material, though I'm having difficulty ascertaining quite why), as the theatrical version feels inadequate, kinda like an MRE -- the meat's there, but little more. On the other hand, if all you've experienced is the comic, then heads up! The ending here WILL BLOW YOUR MIND! Seriously, I'm of the opinion that this version makes a hell of a lot more sense, although the comic drops a huge bomb on the reader that is never, EVER revealed in any version of the movie... There's a reason the original material warranted a Hugo Award. Still, people craving pure action should bypass this film entirely: this is definitely not meant for you.",

            "content": "\"Watchmen\" is Zack Snyder's 2009 film, written by David Hayter and Alex Tse, it is based on the critically acclaimed 1986 graphic novel of the same name written by Alan Moore. The film is set in 1985 in an alternate universe where superheroes have existed since the 40s. Their presence changed the curse of history, and of the United States. Now, in 85, Nixon is the president of the States and nuclear war is at its peak, as the U.S and the USSR continually threaten each other, to the point of a possible nuclear war. Superheroes are now outlawed and most are either dead or retired. When the former superhero known as The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, a former member of the Watchmen) dies, the now retired Watchmen, all become targets of the mysterious assassin, all, as a possible plot to end the world happens.\n\nI've personally never read the famous comic, but judging from all the heat, I can only imagine it's at least a bit good. The novel pretty much started this thing of making serious comics that attack serious issues and focus on character depth, and storytelling, instead of the usual thing, where the hero fights the bad guy and saves the day. But only from this film's plot, that's based on the novel, of course, it's noticeable how great this movie could've been, due to its amazing source material. I think that in the hands of better writers and director, this film could've been much, much better.\n\nSo what's so wrong with it, well, where to start. The writing, god, it is jut too bad, not saying it is HORRIBLE, but it's pretty bad, not going to specify certain lines from the movie, but if you watch and listen to the dialogues you'll notice, believe me. So much exposition dune through narration and constant, never-ending flashbacks, accompanied by poorly-developed characters (with expectations) are all part of the film's poor written script. The visuals and direction are as Zacsnyderish as you can think, with non-stop slow mo, that does work at times, but for most of it, simply unnecessary. Some useless scenes too, that go nowhere and that did not need to be in the film, and of course the dark-toned looks, pretty much what you'd expect from the \"300\" director.\n\nAnother thing is, I understand that Snyder tried to stay as faithful as he could to the comic (as said, I have not read the novel, tho I've heard that the film is a fine adaptation, in terms of staying true to the comic), but damn, did it have to be every single detail. Much like his recent disaster \"Batman v. Superman\", \"Watchmen\" suffers from Snyder's dedication to trying and do the best adaptation ever, instead of trying and improve the material, so it would fit better onto the big screen. I could list the problems. The runtime, 163 minutes, that is way too long, for such film, the amount of (as said before) unnecessary scenes that could've been cut out of the film to give more space for character development, or you now just to reduce the film's runtime. But I still have to recognize Snyder, in light of all these problems with adapting the comic onto the screen, I've got to give the man some credit, he did an adaptation that the hardcore fans probably loved, and still managed to sustain a solid picture for the usual movie-goers.\n\nSo what are the goods? Well even do I've seen my share of it, and he sometimes exaggerates with some aspects of it, Snyder's visuals are truly beautiful when used correctly, they truly are, but the best thing in the movie, for me, was Jackie Earle Haley's performance as Rorschach (A.K.A Walter Kovacs), the man is a spectacle. Differently from some of his fellow actors (badly miscast) in the movie, Haley is in his top game here, his best scenes being the ones without the mask, as the actor is able to express and act much more, then when inside Rorschach's face. As said before with this impeccable source material, the story and plot overall are great and pretty entertaining, and for me, that's what saved the film.\n\n\"Watchmen\" has many, many problems, but it has its qualities, I'll say the movie should be a treat for the fans of the novel, as for the ones that aren't familiar with the material, it all may seem a bit weird or kinda long, I think it varies from person to person when it comes to \"Watchmen\". 3/5.",

This epic morality play about superheroes (and the humans within them) positions a juvenile genre into deeper waters. The nominal ensemble was cast with considerable risk for some truly rewarding performances. WATCHMEN stands alongside and recalls some of my favorite visions in modern cinema. It matches the multicolored and musically-charged New York City of ACROSS THE UNIVERSE and the pulpy violence showcased in SIN CITY. The film even manages to make sense of the book's final chapter leaving me to wonder how else it could have improved with more variation.",

Superman I liked it. I decided to go straight in on the Directors Cut.\n\nHere, similarly to BvS Snyder perfectly captures the feel of a graphic novel, which works well, in my opinion with obscure characters than pop culture figures like Superman. I enjoyed the superhero story that didn't have the stereotype DC or Marvel heros. This has its own mythos, and watching it's intricacies unfold it pure entertainment. It's an alternate reality then our own, the heros are human & the mystery is encapsulating.\n\nMy favorite character is Rorschach. He gets what Nite Owl & Silk Spectre come to realize; This is who they are. Mr. Manhatten is interesting being a Superman parallel. With the looming threat of WWIII during the cold war and him the only thing that could stop it. I must admit there is too much blue penis. There is even a sex scene. I can't remember a sex scene in any live action hero movie except, Super. Great fortune brings most of our heros together during a prison riot, which was a delight. The events that unfold after are a delight, including the reveal of the villain.  I think it's better that I saw this movie after so many phases of Marvel movies , making me love it that much more.",

I had watched the first half of the Director's cut one day when I had nothing else to do, but then I got asked if I wanted to go see the new Jungle Book movie. Me wanting to see Jon Favreau's take on the story, I stopped watching Watchmen about halfway through to go see The Jungle Book. During that first half, I thought it was one of the best superhero movies I had ever seen. Then a few days passed, I had gone over to another house to visit for a weekend and I brought with me the Theatrical Cut of Watchmen and watched the second half. While watching the second half I couldn't help but notice that I didn't quite like it as much as the first half. Maybe it was something about Ozymandias or that weird weird scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre \"get to it\", in on of the most awkward \"love\" scenes ever put on film, especially with the decision to play Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah in the Background. It's a fantastic song, but it just didn't fit the scene. Still thought, there's really just that ONE SCENE that threw me off, and really Ozymandias's plan makes enough sense, so THAT really didn't bother me. \n*One other slight nit-pick, is that they should have chosen a different song to play during the beginning of the end-credits. I think it was something by the Smashing Pumpkins and it threw me off too because I think that the film should have ended on a literal strong, dramatic note, not some fast rock song (by a band that I DO LIKE BTW)! But they did win me back when they played a different Leonard Cohen song in the second half of the credits, but they should have played it near the beginning.*\nStill, there was MORE than enough positives to make up for the flaws. Examples: I love that the movie tries to make the audience think by giving them a nontraditional super-hero film.\nAny scene involving Jackie Earle-Haley as the character Rorschach was pitch-perfect.\nBilly Crudup's Dr. Manhattan was a very interesting character and also a visually striking one.\nJeffery Dean-Morgan sole his scenes as The Comedian in a role that covers all different areas of emotion. He was hate able, but you could also see why he tried doing some things (maybe, I don't know that might just be me).\nThe soundtrack was very impressive (other than the Hallelujah scene), with the credits rolling with Bob Dylan singing The Times are a Changen' (in one of the best credits sequences of all time).\nAnd lastly, this film is Visually a MASTERPIECE! From the beautiful CGI on Dr. Manhattan to the gritty feeling of reality that the film keeps (mostly) the entire way through, and the director's decision to shoot on film gives Watchmen a grittiness that can't always be recreated digitally. *Also, Rorschach's mask is one of the most interesting and creative I've ever seen*.\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you watch Watchmen, but only if you go into it expecting to be challenged, because this movie is not for the faint of heart nor those who don't like thought-provoking ideas.",

By the end I think I came out on the slightly more positive side, because a quality story trumps a lot of the negatives. However, I can't see myself wanting to watch the movie again, and surprisingly it doesn't give me the urge to seek out the graphic novel. It's one of those movies where I will always understand people's opinions no matter how positive or negative they will be because, as I've shown, I saw both sides of the argument.",

            "content": "I do not understand this film at all, and it's too freaking long to want to watch it again to try to get a better grasp on it. To me, it comes off as way too full of itself, like it wants to be this super-gritty, definitive, epic story for the ages, when honestly, it's a really stupid story. And that's fine, so is the Avengers, but at least the Avengers doesn't act like an emo teenager, convinced that it's different and the world just doesn't understand.\n\nOk, so let me start with what I see to be the core issue: There is literally nothing to relate to in this film. We open narration from Rorschach, which would seem to indicate that he's somehow the protagonist. The problem is that a protagonist ought to be relatable, and while Rorschach starts somewhat relatable, the audience very quickly divorces themselves from the character about the time he starts butchering criminals in absurdly gory ways. So maybe Batman 2.0 (I think his name was Owlman but no one ever uses the names of anyone but Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach so I honestly don't remember) is the main character? The problem is that he's such a blank slate and hardly reacts to anything in any sensible way that he's completely unidentifiable as a character.\n\nAnd to top it off, right after the first fight scene, which is completely in the dark (because action I can't see is totally exciting /s), we're told that this universe we're in diverges from ours as early as WWI. This means that by the time of the film in the 1980s, the universe is completely unrecognizable. In other words, the audience has no investment in the universe. Richard Nixon elected for a third term? Why? Do people like Nixon? Why not make an alternate reality where Kennedy doesn't get killed? At the very least, people would be cheering for him.\n\nPeople say that one will appreciate the film more if you read the graphic novel, but to me, the core story is so unrelatable, grasps at so many straws, is unnecessarily dark and gritty, takes itself way too seriously, and is just so generally stupid and nonsensical that I see no way this can be redeemed. Just think about this: In a completely replicatable lab accident, a human is transformed into a godlike entity. The hidden villain of the film proves he can replicate this. Yet, rather than make himself a god, he instead just nukes a bunch of people, proving that he's just another dumb comic book villain, and yet the film tries to play him off as this great visionary.\n\nI really just want my three hours back.",

            "content": "I never read the graphic novel, but I've seen the film several times now and I can hardly get enough of it. For those of you unaware of the plot, it is a compelling film noir mystery thriller about a group of people who become superheroes, are then used by the US government to fight its enemies and are later discarded by the US government. One of the group was murdered and the others start investigating we he had to die.\n\nInteresting about the back story is that both the socio-political climate and characters are well-developed and realistic. The use of superheroes by the US allowed the Sovjetunion and US to become more polarized than in our reality, making the US government far more conservative and bringing the world very close to nuclear holocaust. The superheroes all have their own unique character traits, each based on real and flawed human beings like I've met in my own life. What's most interesting about the plot of Watchmen is the way these different personalities interact with one another and how they set themselves apart from the rest of humanity.\n\nWhat sets this film apart from other films, however, is an audiovisual style few people besides Zack Snyder could actually pull off. The visuals are simply breathtaking throughout the entire film and the audio adds to the atmosphere the way only a few other films can. Watching the film, I feel immersed in a surreal dream and the first time I sat glued to my chair for the entire duration because of the sheer beauty of the visuals, the interesting plot and the fascinating characters.\n\nMaybe the graphic novel was even more compelling as the film plot-wise, I don't think anyone could have done a better job making a film based on the graphic novel. Please remember that graphic novel and film are two different media and you'll never be able to tell the entire story of a multiple edition graphic novel into a single film, however you'll also never be able to control the pacing, acting and soundtrack of a graphic novel. It is my opinion that those who didn't like this film either ignore the differences between the two different media and are frustrated by the film straying from the graphic novel more often than they would like or simply didn't get the story and lost interest due to their confusion. After seeing this film several time, I can't really find anything not to like about this film.",

Casting and acting is almost perfect - Jackie Earle Haley steals the show, and makes one wish he got more big roles. The long runtime goes by with relatively few blips, and in the end honours and improves upon the original admirably. \n\nPerhaps my favourite comic book film adaptation, and the main reason I always look forward to Snyder's future works.

With all the popularity in comic book and graphic novel movies at the time this film came out I understand the direction that Snyder was trying to go.  Let me put it this way.  For people who are familiar with Watchmen and the story, they probably enjoyed the movie.  For people who were not familiar with it at all, got something they were not expecting.  What Watchmen delivers is far from a superhero action movie and plays out more like a slow drama.  I didn't think the movie was all that great, but it didn't stop me from enjoying a different side of the genre.  The usual superhero comic movie shows the origin and then the subsequent rise of the hero beating up villains and saving the day.  Watchmen is the complete opposite.  We pick up after the superheroes are way past their prime.  Old and run down, some with bad personal problems.  Watchmen more or less shows the humans behind the costumes.  So if your looking for your typical batman or Spiderman type movie here, you should look elsewhere.  I did find the movie to be interesting.  Honestly, with a better cast of actors we could have had something here.  The actors didn't really do that bad of a job, but some of them were just poor.  I understand  they couldn't go for huge name expensive names since the film costs so much money to make and ended up taking so long to film.  But I didn't really need this movie to be 3 hours, I think 2 would have been sufficient, or maybe broken up into two parts.  After a while, your simply ready for it to end.  Not a terrible movie, but could have been a lot better in my opinion because the interesting story is there but this cast of characters did not deliver.",

            "content": "As a complete novice to the whole comic book subculture (I realise I am a traitor to my generation), I think it would be unjust for me to do a lone review on this film. If you are like me and have almost no grasp of the complexities that make up the genre, Watchmen comes across as explicit, over the top, self reflective, under acted and far too long.\n\nHowever, as a fan, it is likely you will have a completely different slant. According to my very close friend and movie companion (no, not the same as the chick-flick partner from last week) the film genuinely captures the essence of DC comics multilayered adult comic themes. Essentially recreating the world of head spinning art, societal anarchy and satirical campiness as dictated in the original novel.\n\nWatchmen is set in an alternate 1980's America in which costumed superheros have been exposed and outlawed, the doomsday clock which charts the cold war tension between USA and the Soviet Union is permanently set minutes away from human annihilation and tricky-dicky President Nixon is has been re-elected for a third term in office. \n\nThe scene is set when the graphic murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) reverberates through the remaining superhero community. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) a washed-up clinically insane but no less determined masked vigilante becomes obsessed with exposing the truth behind the unusual circumstances of the Comedians demise.\n\nUncovering a conspiracy to discredit all past and present superheros, Rorschach pays a warning visit his former crime-fighting legion. Starting with reclusive techno-gadget nerd Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and outed hero and business tycoon Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) Rorschach's warnings are dismissed as the incoherent ranting of a madman.\n\nRorschach in his plight then visits the only superhero with any real power Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup). A scientist whose nuclear experiment went arwy was transformed into a shape-shifting, nude, electric blue super-psychic who is rapidly losing touch with the human condition and at whim could bring about the final apocalypse.\n\nAlong with his long-time partner the lycra clad Laurie, AKA Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) Dr Manhattan works to find a way to recreate his omnipotent power and channel it into a never ending power source for the free world. \n\nAs a novice, this is about the point where the film lost interest.  With the characters already established all that seemed to be left was a montage of over the top action sequences, an unnecessary sexual encounter, a scattered interplanetary storyline and decade confused timeline all being held together with underwhelming CGI and highly inappropriate song choices. (Completely destroyed the emotional tone of Hallelujah forever)\n\nThe Watchman was creatively casted. Consisting mostly of relatively unknowns that clearly have a remarkable resemblance to Hollywood headliners mirrors the feeling of the film; Almost there but not quite. Jeffrey Dean Morgan a perfect example, so close to Robert Downy Jr I actually had a heated debate with a colleague.\n\nThe colours palette is clearly taken directly from the comics, focusing on muted dark bases accented with gold and purple to highlight the significant. The bright blue used is for Dr Manhattan clearly reinforces the importance of his powers (and needlessly exposes his over exaggerated privates). \n\nCostuming mimics the comics with batman like rubber masks and almost painted on figure emphasizing outfits. The most unique and yet basic being Rorschach, his simple outfit of plain police inspector style clothes leads all the interest to his mask. What looks like a white hessian bag with ink blots on closer inspection is, as his character, a Rorschach (aka ink bloat test); ever changing an open to interpretation. \n\nThe storyline, although it seams weak, does cram a remarkably high percentage of  plot points faithfully including the tiniest detail, classic panels, original dialogue and a checklist of characters into its 160 minute running time.\n\nThe way director Zack Snyder integrated the fact the movie was based on a comic book was strikingly skilful, recreating the storyboards by almost pausing a sequence mid stream so it looked like it had come straight from the comic to the screen. Even as a novice this was clearly apparent, especially in the pain scenes; quite graphic but still artful.\n\nThe Verdict: Adrenaline-seeking young men will be enthralled by Watchmen. Fans of the original books watch it with a critical eye and enjoy the culmination of one of the most acclaimed comic books in history. Non-fans, it is not light entertainment, perhaps try to be open minded... \n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 13/03/2009",

            "content": "Alan Moore once created a comic, so densely packed, so thematically pumped and totally rotted to the core, some deemed it unfilmable. A master piece in its own right, Watchmen was a feast for mature comic book readers, one that dipped lower than 2000 AD and went blow to blow with the likes of Frank Millers graphic novels Sin City. This work of art was marked from the get go, going through multiple stages of production, with different different writers, directors and actors, for almost a decade and when Zack Snyder decided to take on this methaphorical and hyper realistic take on a world where the Americans won Vietnam, people ultimately shrugged his pre production off as a phase. Moore's classic is set around a group of vigilantes called the Watchmen, who grow up in the shadows of their predecessors the Minute Men, who brought justice to a chaotic world. However after the accidental creation of a god Mr Manhatten, American attempt to turn him into an ultra weapon and deterant, which may win the war in Vietnam for them but changes the face of history and puts the world on the brink of a nuclear holocaust. During the countdown of the doomsday clock, a visual aid of letting the worlds governments know how close they are to all out armageddon, one of the Watchmen, The Comedian, is brutally murdered and its not long before the decommisioned group of rogues begin to dawn their masks again in order to save humanity. I've not ever scratched the surface with that over bloated synopsis and if I was to do so, I would be up for 3 weeks writing a thesis on the piece, however you can completely understand how a film adaptation was close to impossible to pull off. Now I understand there are naysayers, however for me Watchmen is a brilliant achievement in cinema and for Zack Snyder, you have to give him credit for even tackling this behemoth and managing to come out the other side with a film that makes sense and works on its own merit. Is it perfect, not at all, will it feed rabid fan boys, reasonably. Watchmen is a mixed bag and although the original cut is just shy of 3 hours, I am led to believe a longer cut has emerged with some animated additions and a plethora of more contextual scenes, but here I'm looking at the theartrical cut, it is entertaining. Zack Snyder was riding high after his successful Dawn of the Dead remake and the machismo fuelled 300, so he seemed like a viable choice, and he pulls out a pretty big arsenal of tricks here. The cast are a mixed bag, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Jackie Earl Halie, Patrick Wilson, Malin Akerman, Billy Crudup and Matthew Goode make up what appear, at least on paper, to be a formidable ensemble. However the final result is far from the case. The positives first are of course Morgan as the diabolical Comedian, a character who is so integral to the source and the movie, that having his death in the opening 10 minutes is not only shocking but lays a wonderfully crafted insentive to set up the characters, the history and of course the tone of the film. Even after hes gone he effects everyone, constantly and with the limited time Morgan has to play with, he does a fantastic job of not only portraying the raw and disgusting side of this character but the physical aspect as well. Billy Crudup is equally spell binding, although he has a lot more to play with, his take on Manhatten is alien yet human, and he gives a whopping performance for a guy motion captured beyond recodnition. Jackie Earl Halie as Rorschach is fittingly distrubing and equally another man without a face, per say, brings a overdose of film noir and perversion that very few actors could to the role. We then have the not so great, now before going any further, I love Patrick Wilson and Matthew Goode, I think they have done some fantastic work over the years and their attempts and Night Owl and Adrian Viet are not completely shambolic, however, something within the writing and directing of these characters just seems to be mistreated. Wilson is okay as a down trodden version of Batman and Goode, is sinister enough as the smartest man on the planet but neither of them really have a chance to shine a lot, if at all during this epic and for Wilson its made even worse as he spends a good portion of the film acting beside Malin Akerman, who I'm sure is a very nice person, but here she is horribly miscast, she lacks the emotional depth and range to pull of a complex character like Silk Spectre and because of that, a lot of time, whens shes not kicking the shit out of someone or boasting her good looks, she just doesnt cut it and this of course has a knock on effect as her and Wilson are both the human gateway into the hell. So when those characters to gel and come across as almost comic relief, it really brings the film down several pegs. The writing is also a mixed bag, there are some excellent moments of dialogue and monologue that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand tall and a huge tonne of character exposition and arcing, but equally we also find huge chunks of clunky and forced moments that just dont feel part of the universe we are in. Halie gets the best stuff to work with here, as he wanders through the night, playing detective and narrating his own take of a bile ridden existance, where as equally we are forced to endure some really ropey and forced romance from Akerman and Wilson. To the films merit, it does have a lot to say and address and it manages to convey most of it, however some fair better than others. It knocks the tone and distress bang on the head, with praise worthy apocalyptic over tones and scientific and political break through's, also taking time to investigate how being a vigilante would effect you as a person, however yet again, to often is this glossed over or treated half arsed, in favour of destruction and catastrophy. So how does the visual aspect hold up? pretty freaking well actually, all be it some of the CGI has aged but this film actually has some extremely potent and iconic imagery throughout. There are tonnes of moments that this film visually throttles the viewer and there are times when Zack Snyder goes into slow motion over drive. It works for some of the film, but there is slow motion for slow motions sake a lot and by christ does this film have one of the worst and hilarious sex scene ever committed to cinema. On the whole however, Snyder does manage to deliver and bold and entertaining film, even if its not quite what purists hoped for, however the graphic novel still exists for them, they can wash this aside if needs be. Watchmen is a mixed bag of treats, there is a lot to like here and at points its great to feel like your watching subject matter that actually matters in a comic book film, instead of Loki being all pissed off at the Avengers, it has a huge weight and depth behind it and for that its commendable, it appeals to adults, while still trying to possess something magical about the whole affair. However a handful of ropey performances, jilted dialogue and an over abundance on slow motion make this film really suffer at points. Its no Dark Knight but its a lot better than some of cinemas more recent comic book outputs.",

On the other hand, it was also the worst movie I'd ever seen. On the other hand, I was blazed during the entire movie, thus perverting or enhancing the entire experience, so neither conclusion is clear. \n\nThis is one of those one hit wonders; you can watch it one time, and then you're done. Watching it more than once causes shame and severe abdominal pain. \n\nAnd yet, this is one of those movies I'll have to see again. And maybe (MAYBE) one more time. And then once more after that to appreciate all the succulent nuances permeating the entire film.\n\nWhen a film opens and the photography is fucking stunning as fuck, I know something is going to happen to change the very ethos of cinematic history. This film was that.\n\nIt fucking... woke me up. :scared-shocked: \n\nAnd I don't get woken up easily.\n\nThis fucking film had a few cunts get pwned. And I mean PWNED... And that's still the least of your appetite's romantic, vicarious, slaughtering indulgences. \n\nThere's time play. \n\nYes, there's Momento. And then there's time play. I've battled more coherent cat's cradle-strewn webs of time swimming upside down on acid in the middle of orange clouds on Mars-- the time roared. It fucking had it's hand up your dress the entire night. You were seeing double before double was invented. You were feeling the impact of in medis res before the greeks and the Greats even had a chance to unroll the yet-to-be-aroused parchment. \n\nFucking Time left the clock, said an eerie incantation in the form of slower than motion photography and brought itself to life in spite of its own difficult manners. \n\nPeople and events often fight each other for a foothold in what we like to refer to as chronology. People want to mean something while events could care less about the recognition and more about the simple Medal of Accuracy; as a cause of laughter, they wish to be recorded and then go unregarded.\n\nThis is the charting of maps and the beginnings of patterns. This is wooing of destinies by the calloused, potent hands of circumstance, plain, without the perfume of sentiment. \n\nThis film paced itself, set its own course and let its pitiful 20 & 30-something crew believe it had come to see a common spectacle of mundane gladiators. And by the end of the film, no fresh green eye-shaped leaf could resist the silent tarnish brought about by the Pied Pipering voice of Autumn. We drifted together down the drain to the very end of time. And we were washed as we were washed away.\n\nI... There were intrusive scenes of candy-coated affection. The rotting stench emanating from a sterile construction of middle class passion couldn't help but justify the eager budget concerns of those on land yelling to those at the helm, enough to put your nuts in harm's way... And \"The Owl\" could better be renamed \"The Faggot\"... These meteors alone destroy the earth underneath the nimble feet of this once-upon-a-midnight-blaze movie.\n\nBut see it once.. And then see it once more. And reel.... in the narrative. Soak....in the displacement of clocks, watches, and naive notions of recording what will stay in spite of your desire to hold it. \n\nIs it any coincidence that the clocks moved forward on that unassuming day in March... You be the executioner. Let the jury close its eyes instead and shed duty like a youthful obligation from the reptile's back.",

Watchmen takes the superhero genre and turns it on its head. This is a seriously made drama about the hardships of being a superhero. There are kick-ass action moments, but Zack Snyder's epic extravaganza is surprisingly more dialogue-heavy.\n\nIf you haven't read Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' graphic novel then you might not enjoy the movie. It's an incredibly complex story with a lot of twists and turns in the end. You should see Watchmen first for its gorgeous special effects and then a second time for its story and thought-provoking themes.",

I could have done without Dr. Manhattan's blue cock hanging out for half the film - in some scenes he had like speedos on, but then they were gone the very next scene.

This got mixed reviews from critics and the audience which after watching Watchmen, I can kind of see why people didn't like it, but I still think it's a very enjoyable comic book movie. The acting is the best part from Jeffery Dean Morgan, Patrick Wilson, Malin Akerman, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, and especially Jackie Earle Harley with an intimidating deep voice that should've been the Batman voice that Christian Bale wanted to do, but never knew how to do it. The action scenes are really good, and the characters are very memorable. The effects are gorgeous to look at, and the opening credits are really good as it shows the history of Watchmen and its heroes. The story is really good, but I felt like there's way too much story going on and it's very complex even if the movie is 162 minutes long, and with the ultimate cut, I'm sure that it would've been fine that way that's 215 minutes long even though the studio wouldn't allow it. I'm fine with how complex the story is and not simple at all, but for some viewers, it's probably going to be too complex for them to understand to the point of not caring about the film anymore. The costumes look sweet, and the chemistry between all of the heroes are really good. The writing by David Hayter and Alex Tse is really well done that understands what Watchmen is about, and the direction by Zack Snyder is very stylish and never seem like it's enjoying itself. Watchmen is quite a superhero movie that I've never seen this dark before or new and kept me invested from beginning to end.",

As a kid I grew up in the 80s and 90s reading graphic novels and comics and loved them for their dark twisted themes,  The X Men movies done by Singer are OK.  Don't even get me started with X3.  Watchmen is the staple for comic book movies in my opinion.  From the opening scene to Zack Snyders style of film, I really enjoy it.  From the moment  i found out it was rated R i knew it would be good.  The fact that other critics bashed this movie for the same reason, clearly you did not read the graphic novel.

Films which show characters for who they are, not for the way they act, their smugness or their smarmy comebacks. The character development section which I got the most out of was of course Rorshach's, a man who turned into a vigilante riddled with hate for the human race and disgust for the world in which he lives. The way the film shows him in quest for uncompromised justice is fantastic, showing his extreme methods along with his good intentions.¬†\n\nNite Owl's journey, too, is great, showing a quiet, restrained man who can barely even talk to a girl without his hero suit on who is overwhelmed by the circumstances surrounding him, hating the fact that he has to take action at all. Even though, when he does, it is a sight to see; snapping people's arms in half, pounding people into concrete and causing a right ruckus.¬†\n\nSilk Spectre's journey is slightly less shown than these two, although there is a clearly shown confused and frustrated woman who has just about had enough of a loveless relationship with both her husband and her mother, with the overwhelming comedian constantly hitting on her and the man whom she really wants in the Nite Owl.¬†\n\nDr. Manhattan's journey is the most central to the movie of all of them, though he is the least human and least emotional of all of them. It takes the other characters pointing out his subtle drawing away from humanity for the audience to notice it, such as when the comedian kills an innocent Vietnamese women while the Dr. watches on, but it flows seamlessly nonetheless. The strange detour to Mars is confusing to a viewer with no backstory but acceptable in terms of storyline, as he had to be away from Earth in order for the plan to go in to action.¬†\n\nThe climatic end wasn't quite as fulfilling as I'd hoped, but the film's incredible imagery, action and sequences more than make up for it, not to mention the inspired opening credits sequence. Fantastic film.¬†\n\nDefining Scene:¬†\nRorshach finds a girl who'd been kidnapped and brings on the justice.",

The acting and portrayal of Rorschach and The Comedian were amazing. I love when a delusional character is done right, and that's exactly what Rorschach is.

            "content": "First regarded as one of the most important graphic novels ever written, later the film provided a representation that polarised its viewers. The price of peace, the nature of man, relativity of time and the fruits of evil... these are all themes discussed in \"Watchmen\".\n\nI can still remember the first time I read \"Watchmen\" - it was a graphic novel like non-other I had seen. The questions posed, the themes explored... when it's all over, you're sitting there with a blank look on your face, trying to figure out how you would have reacted to every conflict that was presented.\n\nWhen the first trailer hit, we were given a taste of the art direction, and shown how practically every shot in the film was replicated from the novel. Zack Snyder actually used the source material as his storyboards, only making minor changes, and then the occasional drastic change (mentioned below).\n\nAlan Moore's story (paired with Syder's alternate ending) presented a fantastic narrative. I can't even begin to list off the moments of moral ambiguity, action and drama that keep you on the edge of your seat, or even just the plain old badassery. When the film ends, you'll instantly be in internal dialogue with yourself on whether or not you'd agree with Rorschach or Ozymandias. You'll contemplate what it means to see the world through the eyes of Dr. Manhattan. The film's portrayal of someone who transcends time and space is done masterfully. As I mentioned in my review of \"Lucy\", for the most part, our understanding of his abilities is portrayed from the perspective of other characters, and he still has links to humanity that are explored in the \"Birth of Dr. Manhattan\" sequence. The last wink at the audience with the journal is also a fantastic talking point. Was it all for nothing?\n\nThe overall \"look\" of the film is very gratifying for the most part. It's beautiful, grim and filled with contrasting colours. Every shot in this film is composed with so much focus that it's hard to not be drawn in. It isn't until we get moments of horrible CGI that we flinch a little. Snyder's over-reliance on computer-generated images tends to act as a crutch on his film. In cases where miniatures, practical effect and composites of real footage could have easily been used, you scratch your head when the camera pans from a real shot, to an obviously CG rooftop, to another real shot. Don't get me wrong, it looked great in the majority of the scenes, but the times that it stood out, it really stood out.\n\nHand-in-hand with the above, the slow-motion shots were a bit much at times. In my opinion, slow-motion has be used for purpose (ie the first \"Matrix\" and \"Inception\"), but once it's just for visual candy, it becomes a little exhausting and coupled with the crutching CG, it can really take you out of the scene (as it did for me in the opening sequence). But again, there were times where it was merited and for that I still give Snyder credit. \n\nThe changes from the book are apparent for the most part. To me, there are two that stand out most - the first is how Rorschach deals with the murderer of the little girl. In the book, he handcuffs the killer to the furnace, hands him a saw and sets the house on fire. The filmmakers changed this due to possible association to the movie saw. Personally, I would've gone \"the hell with that\" and left it, but we don't know what powers were at play behind the scenes resulting in this change. The second is the big cataclysmic event at the end of the film. Without spoiling it too much, I enjoyed it a lot more than the one from the book. The original ending seemed to come out of nowhere and felt as though Alan Moore was sitting at his keyboard drunk and went \"yeah, that'll do\" before passing out on his bed. Although I prefer Snyder's ending, the fact that he left Bubastis in the film is confusing. Why would Ozymandias waste his time genetically engineering creatures if not for the original ending? It's just out of place and feels random without context and (again) the CGI looked awful. \n\nThe music selection for this film was fantastic in the way in fit the story with the exception of a couple of songs. At times it made the film feel like a parody (of Apocalypse Now with the Vietnam sequence) or a scene from Smallville (Comedian' funeral) and although the scenes on their own are great, they stand out like a soar thumb in context of the rest of the film. One of them that stood out most was the awkward pairing of picture to sound during the sex scene - really irked me. Aside from those select pieces, great selection. This category is one that people still find themselves quarrelling over when it comes to this film.\n\nAt the end of the day, I loved this film and I'll give it a solid 9/10.\n\nFor a full list of changes between the Director's Cut and the Theatrical Cut click here.\n\nSource: http://thespeakingmute.tumblr.com/post/104533455503/who-watches-the-naught-films-a-review-of",

            "content": "Watchmen was a socially-relevant, very gritty graphic novel from the late 80s written by one of the most original comic book writers of the time (or any time), Alan Moore.\n\nMany of Alan's books have been made into movies.  From Hell.  V for Vendetta.  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  And he refuses to put his name on any of them because he thinks movies are pointless drivel.\n\nSo, for over 20 years, people have been trying to prove Alan wrong and find a way to put his \"masterpiece,\" Watchmen, into film form.  And no one had the balls, or technology, to accomplish it.  \n\nUntil now.\n\nFirst off, Zack Snyder has done the PERFECT translation of Watchmen into film.  There is no way it could have ever been done better.  Ever.  By anyone.  \n\nHowever, that still doesn't mean the book translates to film well.  It doesn't.  At all. \n\nZack is very aware of how much it is possible to forever ruin Watchmen by making it into a cheesy movie, so he sticks to the source material almost verbatim.  This makes for an interesting viewing experience, if you've read the book.  It's like the book is being read to you.\n\nHowever, it's like the book is being read to you.\n\nIt doesn't have a movie flow.  It has a book flow.  The film struggles to emotionally connect you with any character, except for Rorschach, who is the highlight of the film.  PERFECT casting. And being so distant from the era of the cold war, even though we are seeing hints of it again, it's incredibly difficult to feel what the book made readers feel in the 80s when the cold war was so prevalent.\n\nFrom the perspective of being faithful to the book, Zack should be commended and, in that respect, the film is perfect, even if they replaced the giant squid with nuclear explosions.  It's a 5 star film.\n\nHowever, from a film-watcher's perspective, it was too long (and, yes, I realize it had to be), it was too dated (and, yes, I realize it had to be), it was too boring and it did not flow well at all, though I think it picked up in the last half hour.  \n\nIf you were a fan of the book, you HAVE to see it.  If you have no idea about the book, do not waste your 3 hours and $15.\n\nSide note:  I was a huge comic book reader in the 1980s.  What made Watchmen important was that, at the time, in the era of Ronald Reagan and the Cold War, what was weird was that comic book writers would not tackle the subject of nuclear war.  It was almost like a silent rule that even though super heroes are supposed to save us from everything, we all know writing that a super hero could stop nuclear war is just dumb and unrealistic (even though the concept of super heroes themselves is dumb and unrealistic).  It was very strange.  Since no one could figure out a way to have a hero stop EVERY nuclear missile before hitting their targets, they just avoided the subject. \n\nSo when Alan Moore decided to tackle the subject head-on, he did it in a very unique way, and probably the only way it would have made sense.  In Watchmen, the heroes manipulated mankind from destroying themselves.  THAT is the way they saved them.  They brought them together by making a common enemy from which they could unite.  The heroes didn't have to \"stop all the bombs.\"  They simply had to manipulate the leaders from ever wanting to release the bombs.  \n\nIt was genius. \n\nAlan's disgust of the government, status quo, etc., and his story's descent into chaos are themes in many of Alan's stories.  V for Vendetta is another great example (and much better done film).  He is a master storyteller though, and superb character developer.  Rorschach, in particular, comes across to me as Alan himself, which is why I think the character appeals to the reader so much.  Uncompromising and blunt, like Alan himself.",

I think that's what did it for me, I have an irrational penchant towards dark films. I also like confusing plots, or at least ones that reveal themselves slowly throughout the movie. Sometimes I'm just thick that day and can't see the ending, which means I'll probably enjoy the movie. Watchmen kept me guessing from the beginning though, with the Comedian scene and the blood splash as a tear on the yellow pin. That scene remains vivid in my memory today. The rest of the movie had no real issues in terms of acting, plot, and visuals. I was genuinely engrossed at every moment and felt bad for Owlman the whole time since he's like a parody of Batman. The ending was very appropriate and looking back, the film provided an interesting perspective on world peace. I can't say if my exaltation of the film was a product of circumstance and if I would have enjoyed it at a later age. However, at that point in time, it was a great film and I still view it as one of my favorites even today.",

Perhaps it seems much more natural now in contrast to the Nolan/Bales Batman.  Laurie Jupiter doesn't seem quite as stiff a performance, either, as it did at first.

Years ago, a group of superheroes - The Comedian, the Night Owl, the Silk Spectre, Ozymandias, Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan - were the protectors of America, winning the country the Vietnam War, eradicating criminal syndicates and making Richard Nixon the most popular President of all-time. But the Watchmen have long gone, shut down by the Government among civilian unrest. When the Comedian is murdered, it brings about a chain of events that lead the surviving Watchmen to regroup to fend off attacks to themselves and save human existence.\n\nThe film stars Malin Akerman, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Carla Gugino, Jackie Earl Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Patrick Wilson - all of whom do a servicable job of bringing to life their deranged and possibly dangerous characters.\n\nIt's a creepy, dark, introspective film - certainly a far cry from the Saturday morning superhero range. But what it brings is a bleak and honest outlook on the human condition, bringing forward a fate where death and destruction are the only options. It also deals with human interactions, as vastly different people come to terms with each other.\n\nAnd, to top it off, it does it with an eclectic and memorable soundtrack!

Normally this would be a pretty standard plot about a team of heroes who must come back together however making it take place during the time of the cold war really put a new spin on that concept which was a huge plus for the story. The structure of the movie is that it shows a bit of present day then it shows some flashbacks, it then continues to proceed like that. So you end up seeing a couple minutes of present day then a couple minutes of flashbacks. \nProtagonist(s): The protagonists are a team of former heroes known as the Watchmen. The team consists of Rorschach- a masked detective, Ozymandias- a billionaire genius, Silk Spectre- a girl who knows how to fight, Dr. Manhattan- production of a nuclear physics experiment accident, and Nite Owl- a low budget Batman. Nite Owl is seen as the least interesting character in the beginning but is an important character as he is the only reasonable and down to Earth character while the rest contain flaws. Rorschach is extremely judgmental, Ozymandias is arrogant, Dr Manhattan lacks empathy, and Silk Spectre is a whore. The one who stands out is Rorschach as he is truly one of the greatest badasses in fiction and has lots going on with him psychologically which gives him the most layers. The actors play their parts well with the exception of Silk Spectre, however she was not terrible just not as good as the rest. \nAction- The action in this movie is amazing. The thing that makes the action great is not the creativity (although that was a plus) but the visuals. Visually this movie is amazing in just about all aspects. Some scenes are gruesome and could possibly get under the skin of some people. \nVillain- All good comic book movies need a villain. Because the villain is shrouded in mystery however I will not be talking much about him. I will say this that he was a good villain and does a very good job. \nMusic- The original score has nothing that special about it however it uses many songs in general that help make the tone darker and more gritty. \nOther aspects-This movie has a ton of satire in it. It talks about society, about government, and of course about how countries interact with each other. It also contains many great quotes, which can be applied not only to everyday life but also to entire nations and society as a whole. \nCons- For the most part this movie was very enjoyable. The only thing that bugged me was Silk Spectre. She was annoying however that was primarily because of the actor that portrayed her. I feel as though if a better actor was used the character could be carried out better. \nConclusion: With a dark and gritty tone Watchmen delivers both story wise and visually. The only problem that it has is that it tries to cram the graphic novel into one movie which can sometimes make the movie feel a bit rushed. My recommendation is to watch the directors or the ultimate cut which help the movie flow better.",

            "content": "I'll start by telling you I saw Watchmen in the theaters before I read the graphic novel, and I only read the book recently while simultaneously watching the director's cut of the film on Blu-ray. I wanted to completely immerse myself in this world before logging my thoughts, and for two whole evenings I'd read, then watched, read, watched, and compared.\n\nWatchmen is set in an alternate 1980?s, where Richard Nixon is starting his third term as the president of the United States of America. It's a gloomy piece of work that presents the darker sides of human nature in a way that's begrudgingly believable. Costume vigilantes have been outlawed, but some still operate either secretly for the government, or privately through their own sense of justice. There's also the looming terrible inevitability of a nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union, so you probably won't be too surprised when I tell you Watchmen is light on laughs.\n\nAfter viewing the movie again and reading the graphic novel, I can tell you the film is very faithful to the source material. Obviously, a book of this size isn't going to make it to the screen without some concessions, but I believe writers David Hayter and Alex Tse have made a lot of great choices in their screenplay. Some elements play out of step with the novel, but in a way that makes sense. Some main characters also receive slightly less development, but not so much that would effect your understanding of the plot. Other sub-story components, like the Tales of the Black Freighter only make it into the Ultimate Cut of the film released on Blu-ray. But that omission doesn't really effect the main plot, and would only be noticed by fans of book.\n\nI have to say I really enjoyed the book, and the film. I loved the varied characters, and the sombre tone of both media formats. The book is obviously more detailed because it can be, and I did find this format does a better job of explaining how Dr Manhattan (the only 'superhero' in this story to have powers), views time and space. On the other hand, I found the end of the movie to work better than the novel.\n\nThe movie also strikes the right tone, and while grim I liked its depiction of human nature for good or bad. The characters in this story are black, white and every shade of gray in between. The society they live in has lost its way, and each hero fights to contain the madness. The ultimate solution to this crisis ends up being extreme, but oddly convincing as a way to move forward, while simultaneously exposing the childish nature of humanity, and restoring a sadly required belief in a vengeful higher power.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you've read the book, then you'll likely be okay with the movie. The sections of the book it leaves out are not overly critical to the plot and understanding of the characters. However, if you haven't read the book, this movie may be a little hard to follow. If you're in the mood for a more adult and somber comic book story, then this is the movie to watch. The movie earns its R rating through its depiction of sexuality and often extremely graphic violence.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is a beautifully shot film, and there are some moments that are truly spectacular to watch. If your local movie theater were screening this I suggest you catch that show. At home a HD viewing of the director's cut on a nice big TV is the way to go. Watching this on a smaller tablet or phone sized screen would be a mistake.\n\nBest Element:\n\nI absolutely loved the performance by Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Brooding, violent and even a touch vulnerable, with a psychotic obsession for right and wrong. The unmasked scenes he has throughout the film are some of the most entertaining and powerful moments in the movie.\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/watchmen-2009/\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Everything told and shown is exactly like the graphic novel with stunning visual and Cinematography that makes it fell like the graphic novel being told towards the audience. The backstory with each character is interesting to learn about how and why they became the Watchmen. It also delivers a well told story about an alternative timeline when Nixon became president of the United States. the slow motion is definitely a style that Zack will never get old of and at times, its gets a bit overuse. If there was a small nitpick in this movie is on how long it is. Its not that big of a deal, but its just a personal problem to me. Watchmen is not only considered to be Zack Snyder best film since 300, but probably one of the best superhero movie made to date.

            "content": "In a market where super hero movies are in overabundance, Watchmen gets made and really has something to say. It isn't a flashy popcorn flick of good guys and bad guys, it's a very complex tale with a lot of grey areas. Getting this made in the first place is already amazing but the fact it was made for wide release is great. For a potential chunk of the demographic of people who probably have never read the graphic novel and keeping it so faithful is quite bold. It's dark, brooding, intelligent, slow paced and doesn't even have anyone in costume for a large majority of it. It goes against most of the norms of comic books movies of today. With The Dark Knight Trilogy and Iron Man 3 being excluded because a) The Dark Knight trilogy is intelligent and b) Iron Man 3 because Shane Black hates the characters and couldn't wait to get Tony Stark out of that suit. But I digress, we're talking about a good film here.\n\nIt might be hypocritical to say it is a faithful adaptation of the graphic novel because I have not read it, I have however owned it for a long time but never read it because I thought it was only half of the story and a few other reasons. I got it along with a bunch of other stuff when I was quite young, I had no urge to read it just because... I didn't. After seeing the film I did go to the book and flick through a few choice pages and it did indeed look faithfully recreated, some of the shots that are in the book have been translated expertly to the big screen. I have heard the directors cut is the way to go but I will read the book first and then watch that and maybe the ultimate cut too. But first of all I just wanted to watch the film that everyone else saw in the movie theatre and have an unbiased opinion it. \n\nBy itself though the film really does hold up. It has a fantastic, strong story played out with great characters by good actors that actually look like the characters from the book, with Jackie Earle Haley looking like a young Clint Eastwood in some parts. Even though I know who most of these actors are it does help to have smaller names in a film like this, so you can look past the actor and just see the character and even more so by looking at some of the casting for this in years past, Robin Williams, really? Not like I don't like Williams but it would indeed distract. \n\nWhile it is commendable that such a big Hollywood production that really does need to make a profit has smaller known actors, I do think that sometimes the acting was a bit off. Patrick Wilson is a very good actor, and one I love to see, as is Jeffrey Dean Morgan, especially Jackie Earle Haley who is the very definition of a character actor as even his small role in All the Kings Men he is unrecognisable and hey we even have Max Headroom in here but some of the lines delivered by Billy Crudup at some points were kind of flat and Malin Akerman's performance was just downright bad!\n\nEverything technical about the film is absolutely remarkable, the lighting, the cinematography and with some exceptions the sound mixing and everything else! Zack Snyder really is a visionary director as he has crafted not only a great film but everything looks so beautiful and unique, the violence pops and the slowmo scenes actually work here and they only show for about 2 seconds each. Also, the script is rich in detail and being co-written by comic book fanatic, Solid Snake, er, I mean David Hayter, and it shows (and some other guy who wrote it)\n\nWhile I think the film is great there are some problems with it, I think the film could use a bit more editing, some flashback scenes go on a bit too long and some of the dialogue is sometimes quite hard to hear either because of the way the actors portrayed the lines or because the sound mixing was a bit off. Also, I started to feel the pace of the film near the end. While it is deliberately slow on purpose to get everything on the big screen that it possibly can from the book and to not make it feel rushed but it starts to show near the end, it didn't bother me because I was enjoying the film so much but I did notice it. Given the time constraints of Hollywood movies, even with this clocking in at over the general movie length time of two hours, its amazing at what has been accomplished and that none of it feels rushed. The soundtrack did seem rather odd in this, while all the songs are pretty good, most of them seem to come out no where and make some scenes quite awkward. \n\nConsidering how much I did like this for someone who didn't really know anything about it, I'm looking forward to watching the other cuts of this film and seeing how much my love will grow, or deteriorate because I'll start to notice stupid little things that no one cares about, but I really can't see that happening as this is a good translation, at least from what I have seen so far and what others tell me but there was no squid! It's a great super hero film but its much more than that, its a dark crime saga more than anything else. I watched this film at just the right time and it really made me happy and most of all just gave me faith in the genre. It has deep, well written characters, a great story, fantastic visuals and for the most part is acted well, it's great to see something go against the easy cash grab big name actors and conventional storytelling to draw in audiences, it's deeply rewarding and thrilling viewing.",

It is very dark as deals with very mature themes that most superhero movies wouldn't dare talking about.

            "content": "Wirh Zack Snyder taking on the superhero genre as it's surface appeal, Watchmen sounded like a film with great potential. \n\nI struggled to be able to pinpoint the actual time that the story took place in because Watchmen the plot structure is confusing. It keeps on going back and fourth between flashbacks and present day, so much that I failed to understand  when present day actually is. I was uncertain if the Cold War theme was a flashback or if it was the actual time setting of the film. Watchmen struggles to actual establish when it is happening, and since there are so many characters and so many flashbacks happening, it is difficult to be certain. Zack Snyder's ambition for staying true to all the characters and storylines in the Watchmen source material is grand, but there is so much for him to capture that he can't get everything right. I just wish I knew when the story was happening, because the structure of the narrative is rather convoluted and the sensibility of the film is uncertain. I really don't know when things are happening and if they are part of a single narrative or a series of them, and it left me puzzled and asking a lot of questions which didn't get answered by Zack Snyder. And if it is all set in the 1980's, I couldn't really find anything to consistently reinforce that because the production design of everything simply felt modern thanks to such high quality camera work. Things feel very modern in Watchmen, and that reinforces a confusion as to when things are meant to be occurring. Maybe it's an example of having to read something before watching it, but either way the complex plot structure was a little overwhelming.\nAnd at the same time, Watchmen moves at a very slow pace for a period of 155 minutes. I know that one of the themes of it being a Neo- noir superhero film means that it is going to move at a slow pace, and the fact that it is a character oriented superhero film with many characters means that it is going to substitute action for dialogue, but this proves to be both Watchmen's finest aspect and it's downfall. In the negative way of speaking, having to watch a 155 minute superhero film which is short on action means that it will be slow. And that is the case. While I appreciated the characters, I also found that since the quality of the action scenes was excellent, the quantity by comparison was dissaponting. The few action scenes that there were in Watchmen were incredibly well done thanks to an ideal mix between action choreography and visual effects. If there was only a larger quantity of them then Watchmen would be more sensible, but since they are placed so sporadically over the course of the 155 minute running time, it reinforces the slow pace of the film. \nAnd lastly, the ending of the story was so conflicting to me that I didn't know how to feel. Usually this is a good feeling, but just the fact that in a matter of very little time the fate of Rorschach was suddenly turned around was so controversial to me, especially since he was my favourite character. I, like the characters in the film, was very conflicted by how the story ended. And the fact that the film spend so long building to it only to give out an ending which was somewhat confusing, complex and hard for me to face left me with mixed feelings. It seems as if it's hard to fully understand the motivations behind the characters in the end without reading the source material, and since after that it was all over, I really just did not know how to feel.\nThe impatient are not the right viewers for Watchmen, but fans of innovative filmmaking are because it is a more thoughtful and ambitious effort on behalf of director Zack Snyder. The style of the film is very interesting, because it captures both the large scale feel of a true superhero film and the small scale darkness that comes with being a Neo-noir. Watchmen serves as an innovative blend of the genres because it's colour is consistently dark and gritty to fit into the Neo- noir theme, and yet it is also electric at times to capture the superhero theme. It's central colour is a dark but electric blue which serves as a symbol of the mix of both genres, and it gives Watchmen memorable colour. \nAnd also, the cinematography follows the same style. Finding an interesting balance between close up and intensely focused shots and wide scaled big shots, Watchmen simultaneously captures the scale of a high profile superhero film and a character focused Neo-noir which gives it an interesting atmosphere. The cinematography captures the magnificent visual elements of Watchmen as well such as it's creative costumes, it's grand production design and the magnificent quality of the visual effects. And it is all edited well against the backdrop of a strong soundtrack which is commonly mood setting and atmospheric. So Watchmen is a great visual experience with many technical delights.\nAnd although the storytelling is far from perfect, the script in Watchmen consistently contains strong dialogue for the actors to work with and gives them very strong characters.\nJackie Earle Hailey is incredibly badass in Watchmen. For much of the film he has to act behind a mask, doing the same kind of thing that Christian Bale did in his portrayal of Batman. And he manages to do it well because he puts a lot of emotion into his voice even though he keeps it in the same deep and angry voice all the time. He creates several different pitches of intensity for the character. When his mask is off, we see the true darkness of him. When he has his mask on he builds his character on the basis of his deep voice and his physical movements whereas when he takes the mask off he has an intense stare to add to it. Jackie Earle Haley keeps his emotions in the role of Rorschach within the appropriate limits, and he makes the character unforgettable with awesome fierce dedication to the part which projects an intimidating demeanour and a lot of though. Jackie Earle Haley gives an immaculate performance in Watchmen and it is the best performance of the film which reinforces the second coming of his acting career as a legendary move. \nMalin Akerman packs a powerful role in Watchmen. With the film capitalising on both her sex appeal and her rough edged line delivery, Watchmen manages to capture the gritty material of her acting skills. She packs a serious punch as a hero due to her fierce strength, and her involvement in the material. Her chemistry with the many other actors is fine and she creates a certain sense of mystery which is beneficial to the audience and has them curious about her and finding her to be a compelling figure. Malin Akerman makes a powerful effort in Watchmen and it seriously pays off.\nBilly Crudup's role is mostly under the guise of visual effects, the importance in his role mainly comes from his voice articulation. He constantly maintains the same tone of voice, but you can tell a lot of the emotions from within him which he projects subtly that he has feelings and simply keeps them in tact so that they don't result in a negative effect on the universe. He delivers his lines as if he has the genuine wisdom and genius of the character, and it makes him fitting for the role very well. Billy Crudup maintains the ideal scientific intelligence for the character by making it seem natural, and he makes a memorable presence in Watchmen.\nJeffrey Dean Morgan is perfect for the role of The Comedian. In a realistic manner, he captures the man as a hero who has become truly angry at everything he is fighting and turned merciless in his treatment of those who oppose him. While the sight is brutal, it is easily compelling because as far as superheroes go I rarely find them gritty enough. The Comedian doesn't joke around, he exacts swift and harsh vengeance where it is die which makes him a great character, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan captures the rough and fierce edge for the character without problem. It is an impressive performance and it shows some of his finest acting skills, so Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a spot on casting decision in Watchmen.\nPatrick Wilson and Matthew Goode gives decent supporting performances as well.\n\nSo although Watchmen is burdened by a convoluted plot structure, a slow pace and extensive length, the visual style of the film and the acting manage to overshadow it and make it an invigorating experience as well as one of Zack Snyder's more thoughtful projects.",

Every main character is enjoyable to watch on screen and they're even harder to hate. The Comedian is possibly the worst person in this movie yet I cannot hate him. Rorschach perfectly gave off this noir detective feel, but oddly paired with this paranoid personality. Professor Manhattan was this character that was essentially a god and he perceive also lost his humanity has nearly gone with only one person linking him to his humanity.

And it may not be the best fit. But Snyder seems to have at least had the sense (and honestly I don't know enough about his work to think that I'm treating him fairly here) to let the work speak for itself. The directors cut, which I watched, his the most faithful adaptation I've ever seen, a nearly scene for scene, line for line representation of the graphic novel, even sharing the majority of the same composition, set design, color schemes, etc. So, insofar as watchmen itself is artful and character rich and intelligent, so is the movie. There isn't much additional artistry - the musical cues especially are often unsubtle, a bit too on the nose. And surely another director could have brought a more original vision that would take more advantage of the unique possibilities of film.\n\nThe one major change that Snyder and his team did make was, in my opinion, a very intelligent one. They removed the least relevant and stylistically consistent subplot and replaced it with a seamless and intuitive move relating to some of the main characters. It adds another layer of drama and tragedy and actually brings greater resolution to the relevant character arcs, without sacrificing anything that I felt to be terribly important.\n\nThe one major place I responded differently to the film than to the novel was the tenement fire rescue. It's interesting that this scene serves the same function for the viewer as it does for the characters, which I always feel is a really good sign. The unambiguous moral good of the situation gives us permission to just revel in the loud rock music, the fire, and the bad ass comic hero action. It is a touchstone for the simple moral dualism and noble derring-do that are deconstructed by the complexities of real life throughout the rest of the novel/film.",

I expected its dark and paranoid atmosphere, fueled by the historical context of the Cold War almost definitely breaking out into nuclear missile fire, to be what I liked the most. Not the case. What struck me the most were the superheroes and supervillains of no superhuman powers (minus Dr. Manhattan, a reborn man who can perceive and manipulate time and space in badass ways) and distinctly different agendas and views on the human race. I could make a chart out of these agendas. Night Owl and Silk Spectre II (whose mother, the first Silk Spectre, was of the original Minutemen during the 1940s) prefer small-scale and short-term victories, wanting to save one life without having to risk another's life. They let the country handle appropriate punishments. Rorschach, who wears an inkblot mask, also prefers small-scale and short-term victories, but has little forgiveness for those who do moral wrong. When given the opportunity, he takes matters in his own hands. The Comedian, an original Minuteman and later Watchman whose opening sequence death is one of the film's main mysteries, has little forgiveness for those who do relative wrong. That is, if you are not on board with the Comedian, he will not hold back any punches (or bullets). Ozymandias prefers long-term victories, with a love for the human race undermined by less humane and seemingly farfetched ambitions. And the aforementioned Dr. Manhattan loses all faith and compassion for humanity, letting them choose their fate. Watchmen is similar to supergroups like Justice League and Avengers, where these superheroes are mostly human and easily distinguishable. Watchmen goes one step further in that there is no common cause between characters.\n\nI am even more surprised that I managed to follow character development, given the thickness of the storyline. In the film's first half-hour, someone kills off a character as part of a possible attempt to eliminate the Watchmen, the history of the Watchmen is outlined through a comic-stylish opening credits sequence to the tune of Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", each main character is introduced, and so is the fear of the U.S. or the Soviet Union sending out nukes at any minute. With a running time of nearly three hours, I was nevertheless afraid that the film could not resolve all of the proposed conflicts. Yet it was done. Thank you, comic creator Alan Moore... albeit with a confusing narrative that involves non-chronological flashbacks. Thank you, director Zack Snyder. What helps less is a lack of playfulness in the movie. It's not that I was bored without humour for too long, but even when characters were out of the dark, they still seemed afraid to smile. I have never been more interested in reading a comic book than now. If I read the book before the movie, I may have disappointed myself. Thankfully, I can say that the strongest elements of the story of Watchmen far outweigh the scattered, grave direction of the film adaptation.",

Despite some genuinely great moments, there's just as many poorly executed ones, and most of the movie is surprisingly flat. A lot of stiff acting doesn't help much either.\n\nWhere a great movie can bring cinematic life into its source material, this movie feels like a slave to the graphic novel, including scenes only because it happened in the book, not because they make sense on screen. The graphic novel is easily one of the greatest of all time. But this story was intended to be a graphic novel, and it's story works because of the unique art style and perspective a graphic novel can give us. It's strange to say, but the movie actually tries too hard to be faithful to the source material, including every subplot and character interaction but not giving them enough time to become meaningful. Despite a nearly 3 hour run-time, the movie feels rushed.\n\nOne other problem I had was the violence level. It simply distracts from the story. While the novel was obviously brutal at times, that was never the focus. Fight scenes that only last a few frames in the book are expanded into long, choreographed action scenes whose only purpose is to viscerally entertain us.

Yes, I just said that and I truly I mean it.\n\nWatchmen is bold, intriguing, and captivating. Visually it's outstanding. The cinematography is stunning, everything looks so crisp. It's got some gnarly action set pieces, with sweet special effects. The soundtrack too, damn that was great. And to top it all off, Watchmen is a comic book film masterpiece.\n\nJackie Earle Haley was phenomenal as Rorschach. He embodied the character like no other. He drove the film with authority. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was real solid as The Comedian and Billy Crudup made a great Dr. Manhattan. Malin Akerman and Patrick Wilson were very good as Silk Spectre and Nite Owl. I am very impressed with the entire cast. The standout is clearly Jackie Earle Haley. He literally is Rorschach and I mean literally.\n\nAlong with Christopher Nolan's Batman films, this film proves why DC is superior to Marvel. Regarding movies anyway, I can't say for the comics definitively. Marvel movies in my opinion are just way too childish. There are jokes about poop and people not wearing pants, etc. DC movies have some freaken balls, let me tell you! This movie and The Dark Knight Trilogy are not made for kids!! And that's why I love these movies. While Man of Steel wasn't great, at least it had a pair of balls and took risks. Marvel films are way too safe in my opinion. Their studios are more worried about huge paycheck, than quality Super Hero films. I just love the dark tone that the Dark Knight Trilogy and Watchmen have.\n\nZach Snyder, I've got to hand it to you man. You've made one hell of a film here. I actually just finished reading the Graphic Novel 2 days ago, which I absolutely loved. This film really stays true to the book. If you haven't read the comic, I can see someone not liking this film in that case. But if you've read the book and loved it, what's not to love with this film?

It's extraordinary visuals and cohesive character development has turned this movie into a new kind of cinema. From director Zach Snyder, this film has set the bar for all comic book movie lovers.\nWatchmen's visual effects have shaped the way for what comic book movies need to be. Zach Snyder has filled every scene with vibrant colors and settings that made fans fall in love with the book thirty years ago. Each character's costume stays true to the original drawings of the famous Watchmen characters. Dr. Manhattan, a surprisingly electric blue man, stands out on the screen with his ominous presences but also with excellent full body shots of his glowing form. It is also hard to ignore the constantly changing ink blot on Rorschach's mask as he expresses various emotions from scene to scene. The attention to detail of each character's outfit in the film should have the audience glued to the screen at all times. \nEven the settings of an altered universe in New York City have costumes of their own. The streets show the decay of a corrupted city with prostitutes and graffiti posters of Richard Nixon across every alley way. Every background has a specific kind of setting that involves what is occurring in each scene. An example of this is when Dr. Manhattan and the Silk Spectre have a conversation on the red planet of Mars while afloat on a shimmering glass castle. The scene is set up where the castle is as beautiful and fragile as the relationship of the two heroes.\nThe character development of the ensemble cast has been the best seen in cinema. Each character has the perfect amount of face time to explain their backstories. Whenever a backstory is told it is smoothly set into the plot with no confusions or awkward breaks. One of my favorite scenes is when the heroes attend a funeral of one of their own, The Comedian. Each character has a flashback on how they individually were affected by his actions during their night of vigilante heroisms. Night Owl has a flashback where he and The Comedian are stopping a protest against the Watchmen. During the scene Night Owl asks, \"What happened to the American Dream?\" and The Comedian responds, \"It came true! You're looking at it.\" The Comedian states the true savagery of civilization and Night Owl realizes that humanity may not be worth saving after all. Again, without having an awkward self-monologue within the scene, Night Owl's character is developed smoothly throughout the plot, as with the other heroes.\nIn another scene, Dr. Manhattan watches The Comedian shoot a pregnant woman in cold blood showing how malicious The Comedian can be. It also shows how Dr. Manhattan is slowly losing his connection with human life. The scenes have fluidity throughout the movie but also making sure that everything is explained to the point where the audience can follow along.\nWatchmen is a visual masterpiece thanks to its costume and set design but also its visual parallels that it incorporates within the plot. The heroes are developed in a way where there is no need for drawn out dialogue, but also elaborates on each hero and their effect on the story. Zach Snyder has taken a critically acclaimed book and turned it into a character driven eye popping experience.",

The line between good guys and bad guys is blurred and it's just so human despite the abilities that the heroes have.   While usually the vigilante ensemble is made to appear more good conquers evil this one uses evil to cause a greater good.  Really fascinating and thought provoking when you see the vulnerability of the characters, their views of humankind, as well as their bloody violent side in action conflicting within themselves what \"greater good\" means. I have not read the comic so I'm going off the film alone and that's where some negative ratings may come from- from what I understand some of the slow motion scenes in action were directly staged from a scene in the book.  The closest mainstream character who would fit this is Batman, or the Dark Knight however Watchmen goes all out gritty with the good and the gore.",

The style is unique, the action isn't too over-the-top (for a comic book movie) and the story (the most important thing in this case) is actually very good. It's extremely rare nowadays to find a comic book movie with a well-written script. This film is nothing like today's Marvel movies. It's got class, and a dark sense of style. The only thing wrong with it is the makeup on the actor that plays Richard Nixon, and the actor himself. He looks and sounds like a comedically exaggerated version of Nixon, which does not match the tone of the movie. The three hour length did feel a little excessive at times, but maybe it was the very fact that it was so long made the emotional ending punch harder. Great performances from everyone as well, especially from Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach.",

Adapting Alan Moore's revered cult graphic novel wouldn't have been an easy task considering the seeming 'unfilmable' nature of the story. However, Zack Snyder amazingly delivered with it. The film is longer than most superhero films (though it's the same length as The Dark Knight Rises) but that's acceptable because of the lengthy story and each of the central characters are fully realised and the actors all fit their roles. Jackie Earle Haley is the standout as Rorschach with his menacing growl and subtle tenderness underneath the threatening persona. However, the other actors all do phenomenal work like Billy Crudup as the mystical Dr Manhattan and Matthew Goode as Ozymandias. The visuals compliment the tone greatly and feel like the comic book has come to life fully on the big screen. As this was the first big budget superhero film to be given an 18 rating, there is tonnes of violence and gritty subject matter which makes it stand out from most comic book films and feels like something innovative for our time. Even The Dark Knight feels tame by comparison. You may either love or hate this film but you sure can't deny that it's ambitious and definitely brings something new to the world of costumed heroes.",

It is a groundbreaking piece of literature gold that deserves to be worshiped. Yes, I just recently read the book and I missed this in theaters. But I know now how all those poor soles walking into the theater one night with their personal Watchmen copy in hand just awaiting this monumental adaptation to flash before their eyes feel. It does not feel very good.\nI'm going to level with you, Watchmen wasn't awful. It was actually a pretty decently filmed movie. That meaning it looked great. Zack Snyder really has a talent for visual thrills because this looked beautiful. It had that Dark Knight look to it, but it had that polished and gleaming flare to it also. Snyder has style, and if only he can get a good script to go with it and he could be legendary.\nWatchmen also had something else that blew me away. It has the best opening titles I have ever seen. They play out after the first scene and they aren't your normal opening credits just showing the people behind it. They do show that, but behind a series of slow-mo scenes where it's telling you all about the world your about to delve into. It shows the whole back story with the song The Times They Are A-Changin'  playing. That is the one time in this movie that I will say the song actually fits the scene, but it did.\nNow time to talk about all of the faults. I thought the music choices were bad. The choices for the soundtrack were very interesting choices. The songs they chose for each scene did not fit well with what was happening on screen and as a result, it took away from the impact. This was a problem, but it wasn't the biggest problem I had with this movie. The biggest problem I had was the excessive and graphic gore throughout. It's this CG blood that flies everywhere when people are shot or hurt and it constantly comes splattering everywhere like it's Gears of War. It's comedic at certain moments and it really detracts from the scene. It doesn't even look good and that really bothered me.\nIn the end, Watchmen has the same problem that another adaptation had, The Great Gatsby. It is maybe a bit too faithful to the source material. I watch this movie knowing exactly whats going to happen, exactly what I will see, and even exactly what people say.They literally have line by line quotes straight from the book said in this movie, and some of the story board was taken directly from the graphic novel comic strip boxes. There's no new spin on it and it ends up just feeling like you copied off another person's school project and didn't put any real effort to call it your own.\nWatchmen may be ambitious, but it sure isn't the best adaptation that the classic book could have had. That's another of the biggest problem with this movie, it has so much potential, but is squandered by the soundtrack, excessive gore, and a vision a bit too close to the source material. I really feel pity for those poor people at that midnight showing in 2009.",

            "content": "While I strongly believe that creative liberties allow stories to be told across any medium,  a movie version of the Watchmen requires greater talent than Zack Snyder. While the script and actors are great, the distracting direction style essentially breaks the movie. The entire point behind the story is that heroes can only function on a small scale; anything larger than \"cops and robbers\" becomes morally grey with no easy solution or clear moral line. Each of our \"heroes\" are horribly flawed (we have an overweight shlub, a superficial vanity queen, a cold/distant freak, a psychotic serial killer, a self-righteous dystopian, and essentially a Nazi), yet Snyder takes every possible opportunity to elevate these characters to \"bad-ass superhero\" status. Much like his work on 300, Snyder manages to celebrate monstrous humans with action sequences of epic proportions and cinematography that makes them look godlike. The movie makes no attempt to hide it's glaring contradictions (celebrating the very issues the script is condemning), with Snyder even admitting that most of the creative decisions were made based on what would be the coolest. While the visuals are impressive, they betray the script and make the movie about as interesting or watchable as Kick-Ass.",

For example, if you see a poor, obviously colour blind girl walking down the street in horrid shoes I might say this to one of my friends walking next to me, \"Hey Terra, did you see that girl's shoes?  The were like Watchmen bad!\"  What's so awful about it?  Where do I begin?  For starters the film is beyond confusing (and I consider myself a pretty sharp, engaged viewer).  The film is also way too long, and the fact that the viewer is left confused for the entire length of the film makes this length seem almost unbearable.  In addition to the previously stated reasons, I will add these:  horrible acting, terrible effects, and the worst sin of all, very bad story telling.  I'm not sure why the film makers thought it would be a good idea to make a film based solely on one confusing flashback and backstory after another but if I ever got the chance to tell them otherwise, I would with no qualms whatsoever.  I've heard others say this was an amazing film, and perhaps it was...for fanboys, but not for the general, uninitiated viewer.",

Before it's time much like Jurassic Park, T2 or Alien was. It was spectacular and wise, naughty and eerie, visual and visceral, strange and haunting, annoying yet brilliant.

Parts were laughable when they shouldn't have been.  I thought it was overly preachy and way too long, and after a while I just didn't care about what was happening.  There were only two characters I was even interested in, and they were the only two who seemed to have any common sense at the end of the film.  The amount of blood in this movie rivaled a Quentin Tarantino film, not that it bothered me in particular, but I found this to be one of the heavier R rated movies I've seen in a while, and I was kind of surprised it didn't manage to get an NC-17 rating, despite how high profile it is.\r\n\r\nOn the good side, I thought the visual effects were stunning; it was a beautiful looking movie.  Nite Owl II was adorable and Rorshach's badassery never ceased to make me smile.  Dr. Manhattan's backstory was set-up perfectly and was the only moment in the film where I was really concerned and touched.  His narration over his story worked very well, and really made that sequence the best in the film for me.

            "content": "The mid-eighties were an exciting period of revitalization for the comic industry, particular for DC Comics, the publisher of titles involving such well known characters as Batman and Superman. The modern approach to Batman received a substantial part of its power in Frank Miller's, Batman : The Dark Knight Returns. In Crisis on Infinite Earths, the mainstream DC Universe with its array of parallel alternative universes was collapsed into one cosmos and many of the characters and their backgrounds were, to a greater or lesser degree, revised. The accumulated debris of decades of story writing was swept aside to make way for a more rational, leaner setting. \n\nNowhere was this revisionism more radical than with the last son of Krypton. Superman is the idealization of the masculine West, matching as he does the power of a classical god like Apollo with the intense morality of the West's judaeo-christian heritage. Kal-el was depowered by several orders of magnitude, which greatly benefited story writing. It is interesting to note that some of the last stories written about Superman before the Crisis was a series by Alan Moore; an imaginary tale about the last days of the Silver Age Superman in which some long term enemies switch from being fairly ineffectual jokers to psychopaths on a murderous rampage, leading to Superman sacrificing all his powers and identity to save his friends and the woman he loves.\n\nAlan Moore and Dave Gibbon's Watchmen remains as the most extraordinary example of this wonderful period in comics, or as we less embarrassingly refer to them, graphic novels. The most exciting idea from a superhero fan's perspective was taking the idea of the costumed hero and speculating on what might actually happen if masked vigilantism became real.\n\nWatchmen rightly became a best seller. Its complex, reflexive storyline centres on the Cold War fear of a global nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union. Taking in a lot of the history of the twentieth century, it charts the rise and fall of the costumed hero as the characters accelerate towards Armageddon. The climax is wish fulfilment for all of us who felt trapped in those times in a world with no seeming escape from atomic inferno. The Watchmen's heroes are not the straightforward types normally depicted in comics; they all have \"issues\" as we like to say now and nowhere is this more clear than the extraordinary psychological jump that would be required to don a costume and physically embattle society's worst elements.\n\nGiven its revolutionary scope and grown up themes in some ways it seemed inescapably excitingly enough to justify a full cinematic translation. But as the creator Alan Moore decreed, its sheer richness, density of narrative and bubbling list of characters could also make it seem \"unfilmable\". It has taken the best part of a quarter century for it finally to come to the screen.\n\nAs a long term Watchmen fan I became ensnared in the viral marketing campaign leading up to the release. Fascinated with the transformation into a cinematic production, I eagerly kept up to date with its octopusine internet presence almost to the point of becoming fatigued by its relentless outreaching. After over twenty years, could I really be losing interest as the release date finally approached?\n\nNow that I've seen it I'm happy to relate that it is as near a perfect depiction of the comic book on the screen, more or less, that could ever be achieved. Zack Snyder has triumphed in bringing the world of Watchmen to life in a shocking visual and almost visceral experience.\n\nThe film effectively starts with the murder of the Comedian in a brutally powerful fight scene. We are instantly aware that though these characters might not be super-beings but are still astonishingly strong. The consistency of the production creates an immersive feel of another world, similar to ours but different. The brutality of the fight does not pull any punches and the audience cannot help but be drawn in. \n\nThe first part of the film is a wonderful character exposition using the device, again following the comic book, of the Comedian's funeral. This is where the cutting back and forth between different periods is used most effectively. By necessity these are a selective short-hand for the equivalent sections in the novel but nevertheless clever choices have been made and this section is perhaps the most effective in the film.\n\nSoon the plot starts to take over again and in some interesting divergences from the book we are shown additional edgings to the characters and their relationships not revealed before. Adrian Veidt seems to be the most different from the book; Rorschach the most accurate. Veidt's depiction interested me greatly. Here he is portrayed as a hubristic Euro-American with his softened Germanic accent and European fashions. I was reminded of a younger version of the characters the great Richard Lynch used to play in the eighties.\n\nThe film moves forward through Nite Owl, the most likeable of the Watchmen. His engaging portrayal allows the viewer into the plot. The changed ending is clever. It is a much more logical and efficient conclusion than the book's, albeit less colourful. I have always thought Watchmen's conclusion was more about wishing away the Cold War than providing a clear way out of World War III but still take the view that with the world a hair-trigger away from annihilation any extraordinary occurrence, whether it be the giant squid monster of the comic or the ending shown here, would still be a catalyst for an all out nuclear attack. \n\nThe film is most successful when authentically showing important parts of the Watchmen story properly and allowing them the time needed. Rorschach's jail time is a case in point. At other, seemingly equally crucial, points the narrative is rushed so much I am not clear that anyone not familiar with Watchmen would really follow what is going on. How do Nite Owl and Rorschach so quickly work out that the whole scheme links back to Ozymandias? It is not clear how the Comedian uncovered Veidt's plot before his killing. The tenement fire rescue scene is forcibly truncated. Nite Owl's hacking of Veidt's computer (which must be a Mac - by the way apparently when looking through his computer's files, one of the folders is entitled \"boys\", another hint about Veidt's obscured sexuality) is treated very quickly. I have never been entirely satisfied with how easily Nite Owl and Rorschach work everything out, but this is symptomatic of the book as well as the film. The world's smartest man has an important password that is the title of a book near his desk or which happens to be the real name of his superhero identity? It seems unlikely.\n\nVeidt's motivation or desire to save the world is also not as clear as it might be. In the book he has a long sequence about his life story in which all this becomes clear and in the process illustrates his own character. In the film there is a short sequence in which he describes some of this to a collection of powerful and rather grumpy business men which then leads into the exciting assassination sequence. As such an important part of the plot there simply isn't enough time spent on Veidt to really get to grips with the man and his role in the world of the Watchmen.\n\nSilk Spectre II is eye wateringly beautiful and her scenes powerfully reminded me how sexy stockings and suspenders are. This is not a film you want to give away as a prize at Sunday School when its out on DVD. The fight scenes throughout are brutal and in particular the scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre II are attacked in an alley showed just what fighting someone with the skills and strength of a Batman would really be like. The fighting is of a fairly straightforward style but highly satisfactory with the emphasis on speed and strength rather than exotic or flamboyant moves. It is a perfect depiction of comic book violence with realistic results.\n\nVisually it is a stunning production. There is an interesting interplay between realistic, cluttered sets and colourful superhero costumes all combined with comic book style framing of shots. Archimedes, Nite Owl's airship, looks wonderful and at times the style of it all almost looks over produced. Doctor Manhattan is stunning to see, although on a few, very minor, occasions, his computer graphic overlay did look a little artificial. The scene where he blows up the tank comes to mind; the movement of the arm is just a shade unreal. But this aside he has been successfully brought to the big screen. I was surprised at the choice to make him glow which is not something that is apparent from the comic book representation. The Watchmen's only true superhero is cleverly used where the plot diverges from the book.\n\nDoctor Manhattan of course has his big revelation on Mars and these sequences were really some of those that needed to be longer to have the required dramatic impact. Mars reminded me of the planet landings from the original Star Trek which, wonderful though they sometimes looked, often could never quite escape the studio bound atmosphere. There simply wasn't time enough for sufficient Martian grandeur or for Laurie's breakdown at her personal revelation or at Doctor Manhattan's re-affirmation of his interest in life. Thankfully Doctor Manhattan's origin sequence was wonderfully put together into a stirring sequence about the creation of a man made god.\n\nAnother striking thing about this film is the use of music. It's a film about the twentieth century and as a result has a very twentieth century soundtrack to it. The opening titles use Bob Dylan to good effect; in many ways this is one of the most successful parts of the whole film. Occasionally the use of this music seems incongruous and I couldn't help finding the love (or rather sex) scene between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre II in the owlship rather laughable especially with its use of the original version of \"Hallelujah\" as backing.\n\nAt nearly three hours though it is a long, long film in accordance with the trend for some years now of lengthy productions. And despite myself, I could not help but notice the story lurch and seemingly stop at various points. For a film about such action packed characters, it was rather slow in parts. It reminded me sometimes of my reaction when watching Batman Returns; whilst I loved the production values, actually following the film occasionally induced a rather awkward, glum feeling brought on by its strange pacing. It was like being on a roller coaster where the ups and down were horribly mis-timed. This, it felt, was symptomatic of simply trying to fit too much into the time allowed.\n\nAnd speaking of Batman, it's interesting to compare this film with another recent superhero film, The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan's production is overall a more consistent affair. In it, he manages the virtually impossible task of making Batman seem almost plausible in a contemporary setting. This is a film of course that is, unlike Watchmen, built from the ground up and purely within the parameters of cinematic construction. The Batman of Dark Knight is, to my mind, rather different from the one of the comics. In it, Christian Bale's Batman is starting out on a road that will eventually lead him to Robo-Cop or Iron Man. In making him almost plausible, The Dark Knight distorts the classic mysterious detective of the comics into a technological hero who only works through his gadgetry. Its success is taking the real world (or at least a rather grim and nasty imitation thereof) and trying to fit Batman into it.\n\nZack Snyder could have taken this approach with Watchmen and indeed there are stories that the movie studios wanted him to set it in a contemporary period with Doctor Manhattan being asked to intervene in Iraq. He could have pruned the plot right down to its essentials and not included the beautiful sections with the original Silk Spectre, Mothman and so forth and given us a somewhat stale, anodyne modern interpretation. Bravely he stood up for his love of the source material and took up the far larger challenge of trying to create the whole world of the Watchmen.\n\nTo film the unfilmable Watchmen was always going to be a challenging feat for even a superheroic producer. Thankfully, as someone who has read and re-read Watchmen continually ever since popping into Smith's one early weekday morning in 1987 to buy it, my view is that Zack Snyder really has brought it's vision to the screen in a gorgeous, powerful production. I hope somewhere he is having his Ozymandias \"I DID IT!\" moment.",

The story of 12 chapters, about a world where superheroes really exist since 1930, all of them taking as inspiration the hero Superman. Each with their own abilities and \"powers\". In this world, the U.S. won the Vietnam War thanks to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) the most powerful of all heroes, powers to controls the atoms (this means he control everything), he is considered by world's popullation one true God. After that and the third re-election to the presidency of Nixon, the police begins to strike and civil unrest against masked vigilantes. With that Nixon is forced to sign the Keene Act in 1977 which consisted of all \"costumed adventurers\" to register with the government. With this most vigilantes decided to retire, some revealing their secret identities mostly to win cash thanks to the media's attention, that was the case of Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode), the \"Ozymandias.\" Others, such as \"Comedian\" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and \"Dr. Manhattan\", continued to work under the supervision and control of the government. The vigilante known as Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), however, has operated as a renegade hero and out-of-law, frequently pursued by police.\nYears passed and the cold war ravaging the world, \"The Comedian\" (the hero most despised of all) is found dead in his house, having his secret identity being revealed. This draws attention to Rorschach begins contacting his former colleagues for clues, considering almost everyone as possible suspects.\nAll 12 chapters were transported in an impressive way to the cinema, the Adaptation of Snyder is fantastic and can be very loyal to the comic. The entire cast was perfectly chosen for the heroes, all with excellent performances, but who stands out for me is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. He was always my favorite character and the film also manages to show me this, Rorschach is more BADASS than ever was, as the movie it-self, not only Badass (as most of Snyder's movies) but it manages to be the best adaptation from a comic to the screen ever made!",

I was warned that I should read the graphic novel before seeing the film and now I see why.  While Superman and Batman have been included in pop culture for a long time, this film made me realize how little of the DC Comic universe I am familiar with and how different it is than the Marvel universe that has dominated cinema over the past fifteen years.  \"Watchmen\" just doesn't \"feel\" like other superhero films and it is not supposed to.  Right away, I liked that the heroes do not have super powers and that they were just average people trying to make the world a better place amidst the Cold War.  Granted, that was spoiled when a gigantic blue character came into the picture, but their inclusion in a warped 1980's New York City was pretty cool.  The concept had a lot of promise and, maybe my mistake was watching the 3+ hour Director's Cut, but my excitement for \"Watchmen\" ended there.  Rorschach was really cool but his voice reminded me of Batman (the Christian Bale edition) too much, Nite Owl II (played by Patrick Wilson who is awesome) visually reminded me of Batman so I was kind of sad when I realized that it wasn't Batman, and Dr. Manhattan didn't remind me of Batman at all but he just didn't fit in with the rest of the characters.  That's where I lost interest - I feel like the movie would've been great without Dr. Manhattan but since most of the plot revolved around him, I couldn't ignore him and enjoy the story.  I'm sure that if I was familiar with the graphic novel, I would like him a lot more but I just couldn't form any sort of attachment to this large smurf.  The special effects are awesome, the cinematography gives the film a really dark feel, and the violence is portrayed beyond what we want to see (circular saw + arms = no cutaway... well in a sense there WAS a cutaway...), but unless you are already interested in this group of heroes, I don't think that this movie will make you a fan.",

This story cannot make a lick of sense if the \"regular people\" behave in a superhuman fashion, and that's exactly what Snyder provides. There is a just a complete lack of understanding here. I feel especially bad about Matthew Goode. Here's a fine actor placed in a sorely misdirected role that does not work in any way-- the character is portrayed from the very start in a dark, humorless, villainous fashion, when the text itself suggests Ozymandias is a heroic, inspiring, likeable figure. It's bad, bad directing.\n\nI've rarely seen a film in which the director's vision is so misguided and directly at odds with the story he think he's telling.",

            "content": "Watchmen is the long-awaited graphic novel adaptation that has for a long time been deemed un-filmable. There have been many different points over the years where this movie was supposed to be made, which always ended up not happening. But now Watchmen is finally here in all its glory, and it's probably the best adaptation possible of this complex graphic novel. Much credit to Zack Snyder who turned this graphic novel that was deemed un-filmable at many points by many people, into the visually stunning masterpiece it is. \n\nThe story takes place in an alternative 1985, with Nixon beginning his third term as president, and the streets of New York are gritty, dark, and violent. The story revolves around mystery and the conspiracy that follows the murder of one Edward Blake, former masked-hero The Comedian, while the backstory deals with the threat of nuclear war and global destruction that could be caused by the Cold War opposing superpowers, Russia and the United States.\n\nMasked vigilante Rorschach, who's the only one still operating after the Keene Act had made the masked heroisms illegal, believes that someone is picking off costumed heroes to begin their own agenda of destruction. Rorschach begins investigating and hunting down the person that is responsible for The Comedian's death. As he continues his investigation we meet Dr. Manhattan, a physicist-turned-godlike being and Laurie (Silk Spectre II).\nJon Osterman was a scientist who was tragically trapped in a scientific test chamber and blown away down to the atom but came back as a Godly-being that is Dr. Manhattan. He is the only character in the story that has an actual super-power. \nAs for Laurie she lives with her boyfriend, Dr. Manhattan in a government protected laboratory/home. Since she has retired from adventuring (as they called it in the graphic novel) she now tries to live a normal life she can never have because of Jon himself. In turn of events she goes to a friend of hers, Daniel Dreiberg, who also happens to be a former masked-hero, Nite Owl II. \nMeanwhile Ozymandias, now retired, has become a billionaire and dubbed \"the smartest man on the planet\".\nThese main six characters plus the tons of great supporting characters intertwine in the story that is more complex than any other film I've watched,. Any attempt to describe the complex plot of this movie would be nearly impossible.\n\nWatchmen was an extremely complex graphic novel filled with a lot of flawed costumed characters, strong plot, powerful sense of style, and also contained a world that seems a little too close to our own. The movie carries every one of these elements in the best way it possibly could. It stays true to the novel, and only changes a few details including the much-debated ending.\n\nThe memorable characters are very well portrayed and acted as well. Dr. Manhattan (the giant blue guy) is played very well by Billy Crudup, who manages to keep the character interesting despite his emotionless attitude. Patrick Wilson (Night Owl II), and Matthew Goode (Ozymandias) are also very good in their roles. Malin Akerman (Silk Spectre II) is probably the only actor in the film that hasn't done the job good enough in my opinion. Her character suffers in everything from the emotions or lack-thereof, the character just felt so soulless. \nHowever the two actors that truly help add depth and a real sense of anger and judgment to the film are Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Rorschach is my favourite character, Not only because he's the coolest but also technically he's not really a hero at all. He's a psychopath anti-hero with harmful and destructive behaviour, even though in a way he's trying to do what he believes is right for the world. He is a fascinating character. The Way he sees the world, his moral judgment is what mirrors his constantly shifting ink blot mask. A World where Justice and Evil are the two opposites without the silver lining. \n\nThe main six characters plus the supporting and even the small characters (Bernie) are different point of view of the world and the society.\n\nIn-short:\n\nOzymandias: Adrian believes the humanity is headed to a nuclear war and an eventual annihilation so he does everything to prevent it, even if it means sacrificing millions of people along the way. \n\nDr. Manhattan: Since he has become the superpowered being he is, he's become detached from humanity, so he does not see a point in saving humanity at all.\n\nThe Comedian: He believes that humans are savage in nature, and that civilization can never be more than an idea. He therefore chooses to become a mockery of society, fighting and killing without reservation.\n\nSilk Spectre II: As she is the only leading female character in the story, she is the emotional core of the story. \n\nNite Owl II: The Batman of the story of sorts. He is intelligent, caring and most ordinary of the six. Had a tragic childhood and believes he must do the right thing, learning and taking the mantle from the first Nite Owl. \n\nRorschach: The Moral compass of the story, the main leading character for my point of view. His moral judgment leads to the events of Watchmen to unleash. He sees the world as set of black-and-white values that take many shapes but never mix into shades of grey, similar to the ink blot tests of his namesake. Rorschach sees existence as random and this viewpoint leaves the character \"free to 'scrawl his own design' on a 'morally blank world'.\n\nWith the dazzling score and the perfect choices for the soundtracks were just few of the great things in this film to mention. The dark and gritty visual style that comes from Zack Snyder couldn't have been better. With the opening scene of the Ultimate cut going back a few decades from the story to set-up the story and the world its in really good. The Black Freighter, Gerard Butler voiced animated story goes in-n-out during the film, paralleling the story as it goes.\n\nThis is a great film that stays true to the original graphic novel while transitioning its style, characters, chain of events, and storyline from page-to-screen the best it possibly could. However if you're not familiar with the graphic novel it might be hard to understand many elements in the film, and be left confused. These characters are not as famous as those types of household name characters, and may be hard for someone's whose never read the novel to understand. Personally I've read the graphic novel twice in as many years, and I thought the movie was incredible and true to the novel except for few parts that I could live with the change. I always give a movie props for not taking the easy way out by spoon-feeding everything to the audience. The book, as well as the movie, was daring by taking of the risk of being complex and making you think for a change. Watchmen is a great movie, and despite its long running time of 215 minutes, I never found it boring at all. Watchmen is a fascinating graphic novel adaptation that deserves to be seen by anybody that likes their movies complex, dark, and absorbing.\n\nPersonally I love the film so much I had to watch it at least twice in the last month's time to make sure I don't miss anything for the review. \n\nPersonal rating of the film: 9/10\n\nPS. I recommend you to watch the Ultimate Cut, also to read the 12 issues graphic novel that the film was based on. You won't be disappointed, I can assure you.",

I think Rorschach was cast very well, well i think most of the cast are pretty good and their costumes equally so. There's just something missing with this, i'm not sure.

I originally disliked this movie because I thought it was boring and lacking in action sequences. And one reason I really hated this movie was because I thought most of the heroes in this movie were monstrous and selfish. And I realize now that maybe that was one of the points that was to be realized about this movie. It lets us look at super heroes that may have saved the day on more than one occasion, but despite their heroic deeds they're just as messed up and just as evil as the criminals they've put away. This point was proven true in the scene when the comedian tried to rape one of his team-mates on the original watchmen team. And while the movie itself was boring I realize that I was wrong to judge it by it's entertainment value and forgot to judge it as a character study of sorts. I think that this movie has some value because it broke the mold of the super hero genre that nobody has done well except in the movie Chronicle. Zack Snyder is a really annoying director, but I can't deny anymore he made one hell of a movie.",

I've read the graphic novel like five times and every time I read it I read it differently or find something new, this was pretty much like giving it another read.  A new angle to observe these watchful men.  There are certain things that you just can't translate and it fails to capture that same oh-so-clever deep subject matter.  I just didn't get the same blissfulness that I got the first time I read the novel.  Now with that being said, this movie is epic in the greatest sense of the term.  For a story that many described as unadaptable, Snyder's huge ambition was a huge success.  The main thing he had to capture here was the characters and he did it great justice.  Nite Owl and Rorschach were perfect.  Nite Owl is such a sad and sympathetic guy and Patrick Wilson really becomes the role and Jackie Hayley as Rorschach was such an odd and amazing choice; very inspired casting.  The visuals were incredible, the opening title sequence rocks (like REALLY rocks), the soundtrack was unbelievable.  It was a great movie going experience.  I will say that to the uninitiated you should get familiar with the story line before going in cause it might be a bit confusing.  It's set in an alternate 1985 during the Cold War where Nixon is reelected president.  The violence is extreme.  Bloody and cringe inducing violence that goes so far over the top.  It's got lots of flashbacks and scene jumping and a ton of deep meaningful dialogue.  Speaking of dialogue, the acting was great especially when dealing with a script that was basically written in 1985 even though some of the delivery seems hammy or phony so just remember that.  Just hearing some of the words aloud, setting scenes to already incredible songs, and just seeing some of the signature slow mo action for so many memorable scenes was so insanely cool.  It's a smart and original film.  You won't see anything like it even after all of the influence the novel has created, the story and characters are still there own.",

Excellent roles. Anyway, it doesn't stop misunderstanding pretty much the adaptation concept. Thus, this film is nothing but somehting similar to make an adaptation of Orson Welles' C.

Disappointing and surprising, since I'm a big fan of the Allan Moore comic (he took his name off the film, but then he never wanted a film in the first place.)\n\nEven though the digitial whiz yet story-challenged  Zack Snyder is very true to the source story and the visuals (the comic is more or less a faithful storyboard for the film), that may be exactly what's wrong with this thing.  The whole thing feels airless and dry and also suffers from some weak casting in at least two key roles.\n\nWatchmen is a dystopian take on post cold war America, one in which self appointed superheroes have captured the public's imagination after WWII (Minutemen), then been banned, then a resurgance in the sixties with a new group (The Watchmen), who lose the favour of the authorities and are banned once again.   The U.S. has won the Vietnam war and is lording over the Soviets in the cold war  (thanks to the iconic character Dr. Manhattan, a godlike victim of a radiation overdose) . As Richard Nixon is on to his fourth term, the story is a meditation on the American dream, the disillusionment of the sixties, the role of vigilantes and super heroes and how they are coopted by the powers that be, and many many other complicated themes and story points,   All of them are crammed into the film and as a result, we have very superficial character development and perfunctory and cold action scenes. \n\nI'm more and more convinced that good film versions of complex literature, even comics in this case, require the filmmaker to select one or two simple ideas and explore them rather than trying to capture every philosophical theme and minute plot point.  This problem was almost identical in Moore's V for Vendetta adaptation.  I know there's also a fear of the geeky fans not approving, especially with a property with armies of nerdy fans, who for some reason have the power to scuttle a film franchise.  \n\nOn the plus side of performances, Jackie Earle Haley is an excellent Rorschak, an obsessive and weasly (and mostly masked) performance, Jeffery Dean Morgan is a macho and charismatic Comedian, it's a shame he doesn't get more screen time, and even with all the CG, Billy Crudup (and his digital doppelganger as Dr. Manhattan) are mezmerizing to watch.  Carla Gugino, excellent in everything, ages four decades here and is wonderful as ex-superhero and mother of the Silk Spectre.  Patrick Wilson does fine as the nerdy geek Night Owl.\n\nOn the down side, Malin Ackerman is incredibly wooden as the Silk Spectre (Dr. Manhattan's love interest) a shame, because I usually enjoy her in comedies and she's beautiful, Matthew Goode falls completely flat as super genius and ambiguous hero Ozymandius, which brings the film down because his role is pivotal. \n\nAlso on the down side is the too obvious on the nose choice of musical tracks from the era, Dylan's \"Times They are A-changing' for the protest sixties stuff and Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' for a bad sex scene with Night Owl and Silk Specter in a rocket ship.\n\nAll that said, the film is almost three hours long but goes by quite quickly due to fun visuals, some very memorable lines, all lifted right out of Moore's orignal book, and lots of cheesy fun here and there.

Zack Snyder brings forth a dark and gruesome image of a very dark and haunting 1980's era New York. The film is action packed, at times blends in dark humour but is always deep,and charismatic.\n\nThe Watchmen are not your everyday superheroes you see such as Superman or Batman. These guys are outsiders, no body likes them, nobody wants them. They are significantly darker in terms of style and morals. The film has a great plot filled with deception, and chaos also the threat of pending war. I loved the blend of real world items of past such as the Cold War and the thick grasp it had during this time. The film was great and pure story from start to finish.\n\nThe heroes (more of vigilantes) are great Rorschach is menacing, brutal, intimidating and ultimately realistic. He is the detective and the one whom uncovers the dramatic plot caused by former ally Ozymandias. Nite Owl played by Patrick Wilson was also great and had some good chemistry with Silk Spector even though that \"air ship\" scene was unnecessary. However its Dr. Manhattan that gives you a mixed response, he's so powerful he can do wonders to help or also he's so powerful he can kill us all. He invokes a great reaction and is also accurate to source material, textbook super powered being. Snyder shot this film great with its angles and dark imagery as well as its various bright tones and over the top sequences. Watchmen is a true comic book world come to life but not one you've ever seen and one that works, one that works very well. DC and WB finally crafted a great hero movie that didn't have Batman or Superman attached to it.",

This may be a technical challenge, but it sure as shit isn't a creative one. On a personal level this gets 1 star. This is the kind of shit that destroys cinema. He makes copies. He's a a piece of modern assholed technology. There's not a creative element in his composition. He makes copies. He is a cultural scanner/printer. You could probably write a program that makes ZS movies. Step1. Locate a well loved Comic Step2. Literally make a live action copy of every single panel. Step3 Make some VERY SLIGHT changes to some panels, typically from the end panels, where its more noticeable, and therefore likely to come off as 'creative input'. Step 4. Create (and this the hard part) an opening credit sequence, but stylize it as a music video, and which really is, a music video (and boy they're really hard to make aren't they boys and girls???). Comics may look like storyboards, but in all actuality, they're really not, and if you cant be a big boy and make a TRANSLATION of the source material into YOUR OWN interpretation, then whats the point?? I mean shit, what's even really left at the end of the day???? 300 is a classic example. That movie was shit. It wasn't ok, it was SHIT. It wasn't even mildly ok, it was SHIT and nothing but SHIT!!! Why? Because the comic was SHIT, and the movie is a carbon copy of the historically offensive comic; only its even more offensive since the 'changes' Zach made, where actually just additional micro-scenes involving the depiction of creatures that did not, and never have existed. FM only had humans in the comic, no monsters, supernatural beings etc. Although it's such a retarded comic that is understandable that Zach thought supernatural elements and monsters where implied in some scenes.",

Most of it's over-exaggerated violence is directed at criminals, it was unnecessary to drive in a point. There's also a lot of nudity and language, so this really isn't a family-movie or a 'superhero movie for kids'. Its brutality, profanity and cruelty aside, the storyline wouln't have gone bad without the film's over-extended duration. Only slightly corny, the movie has some thought-provoking moments which provoked a thought about justice and how society lets it's worst criminals get away too easily. The real danger of nuclear weapons may be unclear for someone who was not born in the 80's. \nThe martial arts acts had bone-crunching scenes, but they were well designed and lots of them were central to what happened in the story. Much of the worst violence took place outside the martial arts fights. Much of the action in the movie is simply gratuitous violence practiced on defenseless individuals, however, which seemed to me to have no purpose whatsoever except perhaps to cause nausea. The other problem with the movie in addition to its violence was its lenght, which occasionally made it seem boring and repetitive.\n The film is saved from being totally spoiled by its ultraviolence because of a few of its grand visions. I'm referring to Dr. Manhattan's words on the surface of Mars to The Silk Spectre. The part about Mars and the value of life and the part about 'oxygen having turned into gold' were very inventive and cool. \nThere is also a moment where the heroes enter the bad guy's palace, or tower, in antarctica, and a rock adaptation of \"All along the watchtower\" starts to play. The music is well done.\n Wonderful details, and one could notice that much attention had been paid. All the special effects were awesome, and I would be amiss to say that they didn't save much of the movie experience.\nKudos also for Rorshach's 'Batmanlike'-voice and the beautiful Silk Spectre, bads for the absolutely ridiculous rubber mask that is supposed to be president Nixon's face. Special effects, Silk Spectre, philosophical musings, galactic visions and just uncompromising attitude saved the movie from dismal failure caused by most violent scenes I have ever seen in any film. Had there been much less excessive violence, and had the movie been a bit shorter, I would have rated it five stars. Now, the movie will have to settle for three stars from this reviewer.",

Nonetheless, there should be kudos for the film makers in making an honest try of it and doing quite well albeit with a very dark camera setting that adds to the mystery for those not in the know.",

Watchmen es sobre justicia, poder, venganza, odio, amor, ira y muchos otros sentimientos que son presentados de tal forma que hacen de esta pel√≠cula una completa obra de arte.\n\nLa trama empieza de forma sencilla, alguien asesin√≥ al comediante, uno de los integrantes del grupo \"Los vigilantes\" que se encargaban a√±os atr√°s de mantener el orden en la ciudad, la noticia corre y Rorshach, no conforme con lo sucedido, emprende una b√∫squeda para encontrar al sicario; lo que lo lleva a reencontrarse con sus amigos retirados, que est√°n en una etapa en la que intentan vivir normalmente y olvidar el pasado. Conforme avanzamos muchos puntos claves se van descubriendo y nos encontramos con que no todo radica en el asesinato, un plan se est√° llevando a cabo, un plan perfecto...\n\nLa acci√≥n es uno de los puntos m√°s fuertes desde mi punto de vista, sin embargo algunas escenas son fuertes y sangrientas para el g√©nero de la pel√≠cula. Los giros que tiene y la forma tan detallada de contar una historia llena de intriga hacen que nos sumerjamos totalmente y que las 3 horas parezcan mucho menos. 9/10",

The CGI stuff, though highly entertaining, didn't add anything to the characterization or narrative--this movie could have been made 15 years ago without the high octane special effects and been much more effectively done and definitely more relevent, if that's what the filmmaker was going for.  \r\n\r\nI was bored whenever Rorshach or the Comedian weren't on-screen but I really enjoyed the opening credits - very inventive, nostalgic, and playful.  Also, I do like the idea of flawed heros, but this theme has been done to death in countless superhero flicks over the past 5 years or so.\r\n\r\nOverall, very entertaining, but unevenly paced, overlong and has a few too many endings.  If the filmmaker cut out about 30 mins - especially the scenes invoving Nite Owl and Silk Spectre, or any of the Dr. Manhattan dangling manparts (way too distracting), I'd be tempted to rate this 4 start or higher.  As it is, I rate this....",
