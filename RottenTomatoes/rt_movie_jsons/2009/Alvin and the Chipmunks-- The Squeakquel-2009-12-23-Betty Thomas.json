    "summary": "Now in the care of Dave Seville's nephew (Zachary Levi), chipmunks Alvin, Simon and Theodore take a break from pop-music stardom and return to school. Almost immediately, the tiny tunesmiths get the giant task of saving their school's music program by winning a battle-of-the-bands contest. Though the boys think winning it will be easy, romantic and musical sparks fly when they meet Brittany, Eleanor and Jeannette -- also known as The Chipettes.",

The cinematography is boring with unmemorable sets, poor lighting, lazy CGI and basic camerawork that is uninspired. The music sucks. They don't tie in to the plot at all and just are meant to sell the soundtrack. The editing and pacing are horrible. The film just jumps around constantly to uninteresting plot points that do a horrible job fleshing out the existing characters and add in lazy unlikeable new ones. This all leads to horrifically boring pacing. Stay away from this at all cost. It's Horrible. It's amazing how Jason Lee seems so over it and not trying.",

            "content": "Drawing near to the pointy, frayed nerved end of these particularly scorching summer school holidays, parents begin the search for anything to entertain and cool down their bored wards. \n\nProviding this single elusive moment of quiet relief is the local fully air-conditioned cinema.  With a seemingly endless stream of children's entertainment the only need greater than the parents to entertain children is Hollywood studio's insatiable passion to regurgitate old themes in vain attempts to satisfy both parents and children alike. \n\nRavishing the treasured childhood archives of Generation X and Y this year alone we have re-imagings of Transformers, Fame, Footloose, Where the wild things are, Nightmare on Elm Street, the list just keeps going.  Safe to say, however, hands down, this has to be the worst and if it wasn't bad enough to breathe CGI life into a trio of singing rodents once, they have added insult to injury and do it twice and made it a sextet.\n\nFor most readers an intro into the concept of the chipmunks is not required, but for those of you doing slightly more interesting things than watching Saturday morning cartons between 1985 and 1989, the chipmunks consist of three preteen squirrel-like rodent brothers who become international singing sensations and torment their adoptive human father Dave on a regular basis.\n\nThe story for this chapter ; After a chipmunk-induced accident leaves Dave (Jason Lee) in traction, chipmunks Alvin (the brash one), Simon (the brainy one) and Theodore (the chubby one) are placed in the unwilling care of a half witted twenty-something family screw-up Toby (Zachary Levi). \n\nForced to return to school (surprisingly, high school) the boys reluctantly put aside there musical superstardom, until amazingly enough, the new principle Dr. Rubin (wonderfully played by Wendie Malick) recognises the boys, and quickly bribes them with the task of saving the school's suffering music program by winning a local Battle-of-the-Bands competition. \n\nWith the grand prize being $25,000 (the exact amount needed), news circulates reaching their ridiculously destitute scheming ex-agent and nemesis from the first film, Ian Hawke (David Cross). Determined to exact revenge on the chipmunks, Ian enrols a rival girl-rodent trio of counterparts known as The Chipettes - Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette into the same school, pitting the groups against eachother.\n\n \nRomantic and musical sparks are ignited when the Chipmunks and Chipettes square off. Will the boys learn their lessons about family and friends and figure out that there is more to life than playing Wii and performing at the Staples Centre?\n\nThe slapstick middle-brow mayhem is well animated for the majority but distinctly goofy. The always charmingly mediocre concept of whiny, serenading rodents found its place on the 80's small screen and that is where the fuzzy pawed heroes should have remained. \n\nBattering viewers with good morals like; beating someone is not the same as winning, self-absorption cause's pain and family comes first, the dramatic contrast to the overly sexualised female Chipettes and overt product placements is a complete turn off.\n\nNot content with just patronising children, the film becomes simply unbearable for parents when the stereotyped, helium voiced, trash-talking fur-balls rattle off a barrage of rip-off quotes from highly inappropriate adult films like Silence of the lambs and Taxi driver.  \n\nA prerequisite for those over the age of 12, earplugs should be sold at the door and warnings should be plastered across the trailers regarding hearing loss and headaches. Still unclear to me is how its 2007 predecessor \"Alvin\" cleared a cool $217 million at the US box office alone, a sheer mystery. \n\nThe surprising array of stars is a definite plus but their talents were dreadfully unrealised. Jason Lee obviously only appeared for one day of shooting due to contractual obligation and was quickly replaced on-screen by comedian Zachary Levi. Levi delivers a plausible but connection-lacking performance as the likeable Toby character.\n\nThe chipmunks voiced by Justin Long, Jesse McCartney and Matthew Gray Gubler and the Chipettes voiced by comedians Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler and Anna Faris were unrecognisable under the computer augmentation. Why pay the money for decent actors if you can't tell it's them?\n\nThe Verdict: Falling far short of filling children's insatiable appetite for talking animals, this careless low-budget enterprise trades in weak reiterations of subplots past. The Squeakquel is as entertaining as your standard breakfast cereal commercial and is as easily forgettable.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 15/01/2010",

The main problem is all the chipmunks and chipettes(I understand introduction of  as they where in cartoon in late 80's till early 90's) but see in the cartoon Theadore and Elanor where 5 yrs old chubby kindergartens. Alvin and Brittany where 7-8 yr olds with bossy tendency and got into loads of trouble. Simon and Jeanette where smart and shy 9-10 yr olds. Still grade school rock/pop star children it wasn't exactly rock or pop music somewhere inbetween weird but worked in show. Though Simon and Jenette who behaved best as makes sense might have utaken some hs classes. They where all still young children. Putting them all in same grade in hs made 0 sense. I only watched this movie out of boredom when it was free on tv for some reason I stumbled upon it and watched it cause it was a train wreck. \n\nsometimes you watch something to see how bad it is. Their would have been less issue if they had all been in grade school fluff it would have been ok if Simon and Jeantte where in middle school and younger four in grade school. with grade or two separating them. would it have fixed movie completely no would it have been better yes. \n\nHollywood failed to know source material so hard.  Their where many little flaws but to do my own history with chipmunks the fact their was no age difference in the live action movies.\n\nI probably would have been ok with it if like Simon and Jeanette where Sr in hs and Alivin and Brittney sophomores in hs and like maybe they go to combined middle school and hs and Theodore and Elanor where in 8th grade.  \n\nSorry for harping on one issue. I just know I could so made movie better. adds another fanfiction to list of things I am working on. The other big issue is why cgi live action mashup they never turn out well all cgi would have been ok as their where cartoon children with chipmunk children in original cartoon of course I prefer pure cartoon style but cgi is better then combining it with unecessary live action.",

Here he's manipulative in a child-like fashion through and through, and you can see his grand plot from a mile away when he tries to isolate one of the Chipettes whom he thinks will be a better solo artist at the expense of the rest. So it's a revisit of the same old themes of family togetherness over friends, or over careers, which got repeated twice for the different triplets. And it's either me, or somehow having the chipmunks all sounding alike (despite having a different voice cast) got to me this time round. The redeeming grace of having them sing and dance to contemporary pop tunes also took a nose dive here, having the number of performances got reduced, and of course the novelty of having such songs \"munked\" have lost their lustre.\nHowever, having it released during this festive period would mean that all will get forgiven, and children will once again be thrilled by the all singing, all dancing chipmunks welcoming the festive cheer. There's a coda at the end of the film as well, so don't just head out the cinema once the credits start to roll.",

Neither movie is as good as the timeless TV show or the wonderful Chipmunk Adventure, but in many ways more than one both are cute and harmless movies without trying to be 5-star masterpieces.\nAlvin and the Chipmunks:The Squeakquel has cons that are similar to its predecessor. As with the first, the film is very predictable with some clich√É (C)d human characters and situations, though in fairness a lot of animated/live action films do have that problem as well. Also it does have some hits and misses in the script with some jokes that parents might groan at. The film is rather short and rushed as well.\nFaults aside, the film does have an improvement, the performance of Jason Lee as David. In the first he was miscast and out of his depth, here he is much more comfortable and relaxed. Visually and technically, I have little to fault it either. The photography and editing is crisp without being award-worthy, the location work is quite colourful and striking and the animation on the chipmunks again is spot on being very cute. The chipmunks are adorable with voices that are thankfully not irritating, and as with the first Alvin and the Chipmunks:The Squeakquel nails the personalities of the chipmunks, Theodore again being the best realised. And the soundtrack is very catchy, with tuneful melodies and sweet lyrics, which kids will love and adults will possibly tolerate too.\n6/10",
