    "summary": "Retired auto worker and Korean War vet Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) fills emptiness in his life with beer and home repair, despising the many Asian, Latino and black families in his neighborhood. Walt becomes a reluctant hero when he stands up to the gangbangers who tried to force an Asian teen to steal Walt's treasured car. An unlikely friendship develops between Walt and the teen, as he learns he has more in common with his neighbors than he thought.",

            "content": "The story of Walt Kowalski, an aged and bitter Korean War veteran, is told in the dramatic and thought-provoking movie \"Gran Torino\" and is very good portrayed by Clint Eastwood. Walt is introduced as a cranky and angry loner who is cut off from his family and the society around him in the movie, which is set in a poor Detroit neighborhood.\nI found the film's handling of topics of racism and ethnic diversity to be extremely interesting. Walt builds a connection to the family next door against his initial prejudices and hesitation to interact with his Hmong neighbors, especially with Thao, a young kid who is pulled into a gang.\nThe moment in which Walt teaches Thao how to use tools and repair his cherished item, a 1972 Gran Torino, is one of the most touching and iconic in the movie. Walt and Thao create a true friendship that transcends their generational and cultural gaps through their shared love of cars.\nSimply, \"Gran Torino\" is a powerful and well-made movie that gives a perceptive and profound commentary on the difficulties of personal relations and the strength of forgiveness. Clint Eastwood's outstanding performance, combined with the film's subtle but powerful storyline, makes it a great film.",

I believe it paints an interesting picture of a torn character, with its symbolism accessible even to amateurs like me. But symbolism is very subjective, which is why I urge to watch this movie and  get your own impression. To me it mostly told a story about peace of mind, but I´ll be happy to hear other opinions. This movie deserves to be thought about.",

What I particularly like about the film is the personal development of Walt. His initial racist behavior towards the Hmong people turns into affection and understanding during the film. Although he has many prejudices against his new neighbors, he still manages to shed them by getting to know the Hmongs better. Especially in his friendship with Thao, he has learned a lot. At the end, he even sacrificed himself, which really made me cry. To summarize: Walt embodies that you are never too old to change into a better person - an very important message.\nGreat movie!  ;)",

            "content": "Who would have thought that „Gran Torino\" does not only deal with an individual fate of a grumpy old man and his Hmong neighbors that are involved in gang fights but reflects society in the most dramatic way.\nThe movie, in which Clint Eastwood is director as well as the actor of the main protagonist Walt Kowalski, focuses on culture clashes. Walt, a Vietnam war veteran and widower, has a difficult relation to his family. After a rather unpleasant first encounter with his Hmong neighbor Thao Lor, who tries to steal Walt's Gran Torino, he gets in contact with the Lor family. A deep and sincere bound starts to develop and connect Walt with the Lors as a surrogate family so that Walt sees himself as their protector from hostile gangs in the neighborhood. \nDespite all stereotypes that are presented, the combination of humor or rather Walt's sarcasm with the ugliness of life effects remarkable authenticity but also underlines the tragedy of the story. In that way the movie can be seen as an attention-getter for such brutal culture clashes but also as an outstanding cinematographic memorial of the people that fall victim to cultural hostility.",

But there's something very satisfying in watching the old pro fill in a role that seems almost too-perfect for him. This may not be his best performance, but it's one that allows him the joy of growling most of his lines in that good old-fashioned Dirty Harry delivery and it lets him build some heart and dark, racial-driven laughs into that persona. The script by newcomer Nick Schenk is too melodramatic and doesn't really cover any new ground. Eastwood chose to cast much of this with unprofessional, first-time actors. And their inexperience shows--painfully, at times. But Eastwood (as he usually is) is commanding behind the camera, having a good economy of storytelling and going for simple, if simplistic, cinematography. The laughs are big, but the emotions aren't as wrenching as they should be, mainly due to the bad young actors. And if Eastwood has played variations of this cantankerous sort before, it just goes to show that no one else can do it quite like Clint",

Having lived in decaying elderly neighborhoods being replaced by immigrants, I can say, yeah, that is how it is.  Sure, over the top for film, but captures that feel for sure.  Like Eastwood's other later films (Letters from Iwo Jima comes to mind), Eastwood loves to explore all sides of an issue - in this case, race and crime.  The film chronicles an old man discarded and left behind by his tribe and basically adopted into an immigrant Hmong family that he protects.  He is a grizzled, shut off, very arguably racist old man, but this movie is anything but racist.  It tries to show, I think, that folks are a product of their time and origin, but even while being stuck in old patterns, can overcome that.  Judge by actions, not words.  This movie shows that more blatantly than any other I can think of.\nThere are only a couple of weak spots - some of the supporting cast submitted weak performances, and there are a few 'The More you Know' after school special moments, but otherwise very riveting.",

The story is mostly engaging with an interesting protagonist, but there are a few moments where it is hackneyed and predictable, which is my only criticism of this movie. In regard to the acting, Clint Eastwood gives a very commanding performance and the kids are also very good mostly. Overall, very well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I admittedly do have a difficult time separating film and real life, to me films are just fictional things but I get they can/do have real world implications.\n\nStrictly as a film, it is entertaining. Clint Eastwood is remarkably good at being a super racist and super grumpy old man, who literally hates every single person he encounters across the opening portion of the film. His character's lines in this are nuts and his delivery with them is incredible - the look of utter disgust on Walt Kowalski's face when someone pisses him off in a new way is just amusing to watch. If not for his on point delivery, it wouldn't have worked.\n\nEastwood is the only actor in this worth talking about on a grander level, though I could've done without his ropey singing at the end, but I did enjoy the showings of the earlier mentioned Vang, Ahney Her and John Carroll Lynch - not that the latter does much, I just like the guy as an actor... all stems from 'The Walking Dead', he's in literally one episode back in 2015 and yet I always remember his character.\n\nI'm not sold on the ending, Walt isn't exactly redeemed and it does reek of white saviour let's be real, but it didn't affect my enjoyment in film terms to be honest.",

Gran Torino probably doesn't even count as a latter day Eastwood anymore, it was twelve years ago, but it hasn't diminished in that time, it remains an evocative depiction of class and race in American society, and Eastwood gives an excellent portrayal as an ageing out of time and place elderly American. It may occasionally falter, but Gran Torino is an important film to use in analysis twelve years on.",

Perhaps it’s just because I’m getting a bit older myself, but I could totally understand how he was stuck in his ways and struggled to connect with his kids and grandkids. Perhaps those relatives were depicted in a way that was a bit too negative, but there is a lot of truth in the different ways these generations prioritize things. I could also understand our main character’s struggle with the young priest who continues to irritate him. But the heart of Gran Torino lies in his slowly developed relationship with his Hmong neighbors. I cannot say enough about my enjoyment of these interactions. It was funny and heartwarming in all the right ways. They took time to develop things as well, so I never got the impression that people were changing on a whim, but they were actually growing and maturing into a true bond of friendship. I want to say I loved everything about Gran Torino and just be done with it, but there was one aspect that soured the experience a bit for me, and will probably keep this from becoming one of my favorite films. I struggle at times with characters that are written like Walt Kowalski, who have such open and unchecked racism. When it’s this aggressive, it can feel like the writers are hiding behind a “misguided character with a heart of gold” to spew hate speech and play it off as “funny.” Trying to excuse it by showing that his speech is just as vile with his friends doesn’t do enough to make it charming for me. It certainly doesn’t help the racist bent of this movie when it becomes a massive white-savior story. I allowed myself to forgive Gran Torino because you can view it as the neighbors saving him from his own grief, loneliness, prejudice, and hatred. There is also an element of regret in Eastwood’s performance, and I tried to convince myself that was good enough. Besides, the story is so enjoyable that I was trying to ignore the negatives, but I wouldn’t blame anyone who is horribly offended by Gran Torino.",

I will not spoil that as its pure golden. Walt Kolwalski is a real curmudgeon that, while vile, is so funny you gotta love him.

Gran Torino is a movie displaying gang violence, because it takes place in a gang-ridden neighborhood.  The rest of the actor's poor acting skills overshadow Eastwood's great acting.  Walt (Clint Eastwood) is a person who seems to strongly dislike his family because they tend to use him to attempt to get football tickets and even inherit his classic Gran Torino that he got when working at a Ford plant.  His granddaughter even goes as far to ask him what he will do with it after he passes away.  Walt used to live in a clean, kept up town, but since times have changed the town isn't as appealing as it used to be.  Hmong people have moved around him and brought a gang with them.  The gang leads to Thao (Bee Vang) to get in trouble with Walt by making him attempt to steal his car.  This is unusual for the boy and eventually pays Walt back by doing odd jobs around the neighborhood for him.  Walt sees who the boy really is and takes him under his wing.  He gets Thao a job, and even try's to protect him from the gang.  Eastwood does a great job acting, but his acting counterparts bring the movie down.  The young actors are sometimes cringe worthy along with the directing. Eastwood's directing seems questionable.  In one scene the neighbors invite him to a party, and Walt actually goes.  This seems very out of character for Walt, and should've had the neighbors beg him more instead of just telling him there is beer. Which is all they needed to get him over.  Gran Torino portrays a great story, but sadly is brought down by some shabby acting.",

            "content": "A racist Korean War veteran has to deal with his own prejudice when a Hmong teenager tries to steal his car.\n\nActing: 8\nClint Eastwood comes out of the gates swinging in playing racist Walt Kowalski. I thought it was a daring role seeing as, even though the character had a strong prejudices, you were still supposed to somehow like and respect him. Clint walks that line finely and pulls the role off with that smooth ease I've seen in a number of his previous roles. \n\nSpecial love to a strong supporting role from Chee Thao who plays the angry Grandma of the Hmong family. She hates Clint as much as he hates her and their chemistry makes for some hilarious scenes. She captures the role perfectly.\n\nBeginning: 1\n\nCharacters: 10\nGran Torino features a rich array of characters with meaning and depth. Walt is a man set in his ways after the war hardened him, but you find his walls slowly tearing down as the movie progresses. He reluctantly lets in the people that he wouldn't normally and finds himself becoming closer to them than his own family. While his heart may have changed, I appreciated the fact that his mouth didn't. Walt, with his brutal honesty, always spoke what was on his mind at all times which was funny and refreshing at the same time.\n\nThao (Bee Vang) has his own internal struggle as he deals with getting his education while trying to take care of his family and still fit in with the men in his family. He wants to be different than his thug cousins but he's too much of a softy to stand up for himself. Thao and Walt end up on a collision course towards each other surrounded by a number of characters that have their own stories worth paying attention to.\n\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\nA lot of scenes stuck out in my head when considering Gran Torino. From family dinners to one-off scenes with Walt and Thao, the film provides believable insight into Walt becoming closer to his \"enemies\" than his own family. The dinners were shot in a claustrophobic type of way. Thao's house was littered with people and you find a surrounded Walt trying to navigate his way through while steering clear of being social. The film as a whole was shot in a dark style indicative of looming danger. It's unnerving in a way, but effective at the same time.\n\nConflict: 10\n\nGenre: 7\n\nMemorability: 10\nThe hard dramatic shift in the film is like a gut punch, both jarring and unexpected. I appreciate when a film can change tones and still be effective. I also appreciate when films show racism from both sides of the fence. There's a refreshing sense of realism you get with Gran Torino that may be sacrificed in other films for the sake of getting a point across. In Torino, no one is innocent. No one is exempt.\n\n\nI can't even count the number of one-liners that Walt provides throughout the span of the movie. My personal favorite: \"Good day, puss cake.\" I have often considered how hilarious it would be to randomly say that to someone. There's still time...\n\n\nPace: 6\nDefinitely could have been improvement in the pacing department. The beginning starts off extremely slow before moving at a shaky pace. It finally levels out at about the half hour mark, but the damage had already been done for me at this point.\n\n\nPlot: 10\nSolid storyline from beginning to end that is both intriguing and unique. We are provided with an insight into a different culture in an endearing way that makes you smile. \n\n\nResolution: 5\n\nOverall: 77\nGran Torino is an original film that succeeds with gritty realism and strong characters. A few tweaks, particularly a stronger ending, would have put the movie into a higher tier for me. Still a solid watch.",

There's really nothing subtle about how anything is revealed. Less would have been better. But Eastwood's performance and the relationship between Walt and Thao are convincing and sell the story, which is the most important thing. While the setup is a bit hamfisted, the sweeter moments are handled deftly, and are genuine and meaningful.

            "content": "The film Gran Torino is the complete embodiment of a Drama. Clint Eastwood has done something that no one has done. Hell, I watched an 80-year-old Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry, take a bubble bath and I didn't bat an eye. What he did was make a fictional tale about the current state of America from the point of view of a racist old war veteran. And who better to play a racist war hero none other than the Director and writer himself, the legend in his own right, Clint Eastwood. To myself, I just have to wonder how an 80-year-old man made this epic tale. He includes even his whole life and his story into this character up until the closing credits. He captures you with the raw truth of this world in a way that you could never imagine, through the eyes of a racist old man. So in a way he made a movie about the world through Clint Eastwood's eyes.\nThe character this tale surrounds is Clint Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski. However, it's not just Walt that embodies this world it's also the characters that surround him. He starts the movie as a racist old Polish-American man set in his ways. Unbeknownst to him he will make the transition into selfless hero. Each person he meets along the way helps him see the world he once knew a bit more clearly. And I must say again Clint Eastwood wrote this movie and directed so the avenues he takes to prove his powerful point seems bizarre in the fact that you forget Clint Eastwood for a bit and picture Walt. Walt is a man who fought in the Vietnam war and killed many Vietnamese soldiers because he was ordered too and because he had too. He lets the viewer constantly know that he hated it. Fast forward through all the pains of war, a movie in and of itself. He comes back to America and marries the Girl of his dreams, Dorothy. They have a beautiful traditional life together and they have two sons, Steve and Mitch. He worked in a ford factory, there in the motor city of Detroit, Michigan, inadvertently giving his sons a privileged life he can never relate to. And as he gets old and his wife dies he loses the one human being who truly gets him, Dorothy. \nThe time is now, the millennial era, Walt is standing at his wife's funeral watching as his family file into rows with utter disgust. His grandchildren showed little to no respect for their grandmother's funeral. For example, his eldest granddaughter wore a halter top. This was just an opening example that he had a genuine hate for everything disrespectful no matter what race. When he refers to any white person he meets throughout the film he calls the Irish and Italian slurs. But his true connection is shown when he becomes a father like figure to a Hmong boy named Thao. The truly amazing part of this tale was that Walt thought Thao looked like a young Vietnamese boy who he shot cold bloodily during the war. In one of the beginning scenes of the movie Walt held a gun to Thao's head, He must have had a flashback of the war. This instance in the movie was due the fact that Thao was told by his Cousin's Gang to rob Walt's Gran Torino, his most prized possession. The Torino was built straight off the line in a Ford Factory Walt worked at. And this car has been admired by many throughout the movie, from his Granddaughter to the gangs and everyone in between. \nNow back to Thao's influence on Walt's life. Thao is a young man around high school to college age with no ambition or motivation. He is rather easily talked to by a gang into stealing Walt's car. And if not for Walt scaring him away with his gun, the whole situation would have turned out quite differently. After that incident Thao rejected the gang and was put into a situation where he was saved by Walt, who scared the gang away with a gun. Thao's Hmong family, who were so thankful, brought Walt into their family as well as have Thao work off the damage he's done for stealing his car. During this time, they grow a bond that Walt describes towards the end of the movie as one he's never had, a father son bond. After Thao's service is done Walt still keeps him under his wing as well as becoming more acquainted with Hmong. Even learning that they fought on the same side during the Vietnamese War.\nWithout spoiling the beautiful ending, I will describe the one powerful plot lines that take place before the touching end. It's the day Walt gets Thao a job and some tools. Their day's journey begins with Walt taking Thao to become a man by showing him how men talk at Barbershops, they used racial slurs in the nicest way possible to someone different. Next he got a construction Job with a Union. And from my knowledge that is very hard to get unless you have connections. Finally, he brought him some tools on a loan that Thao would pay him back. Thao thankfully takes this new motivation in life and works towards a better future. I will not speak on what happens next to not spoil this film for anybody that did not watch it yet. By the way, please watch this film. \nFor those who don't know what that sequence of scenes showed, it showed Walt truly gaining a son who he felt a connection to. Not to say anything bad about his own children, even though Clint Eastwood gave his son Scott Eastwood a bit part in this movie. This is Walt gaining a son who looked like the boys he killed in the war and learning to love him like a son. Also this isn't a white savior movie Eastwood, I believe strategically, has his character call himself the \"White devil.\" I can say I've watched this film many times and it has made me appreciate all of Clint Eastwood's other movies. It's a spaghetti western situated in Detroit Michigan during the year 2008. He brought his entire career into this movie the action, the drama, and he even sings the closing credits; an ode to his career in Jazz music. Even though this film could've been the ultimate form of self-gratification from Clint, I believe this is the ultimate form of Art from a man who's had a career as hard as stone.",

            "content": "Gran Torino is a very good movie, which loses out on the chance to be great due to a surprisingly flat performance by star/director/producer Eastwood.  Clint plays Walt Kowalski. an old-school, cuss-mouthed, gun-totin', beer-guzzlin', slur-throwin', scowling, grunting, grumpy, contemptuous Korean War vet and right honorable SOB, coping with the loss of his wife and interacting begrudgingly with the Asian Ethnic enclave that has taken over his neighborhood.  For a long while we tag along with Walt as he slowly warms to his \"gook\" neighbors, particularly cheeky and precocious teenager Sue (Ahney Her in a wonderful performance), and her younger brother Thao, who Walt catches trying to steal his '72 Gran Torino for a local gang.  Eventually Walt takes the boy under his wing, but as the boy wises up the threat of retaliation by the thugs he snubbed threatens the whole neighborhood.\n\nUnfortunately for us, Clint plays Walt as a caricature of the man he could be rather than the man himself. For a man with such a ripe and conflicted background he carries no nuance whatsoever, beating the \"I'm pissed at the world and I'll say whatever the f%&k I want\" drum over, and over, and over.  The result is a wonderfully long string of unintentional comedy permeating the first two-thirds of the film.  Were Eastwood to follow these laughs and the thus-far pleasant, predictable plot to the end, he would have made an unremarkable but perfectly entertaining film.\n\nGran Torino aspires to be above that, but by the time it speeds up and turns to a dark, compelling place befitting that aspiration, we're too stuck in the silliness to become engrossed, and when it reaches its poignant and powerful end, I found it hard to be moved. \n\nDepsite the disjuncture, Gran Torino is a strong film, and well worth a watch or two. Had Eastwood breathed a bit more life into his character in the early goings, however, he would have elevated the film to a much higher level.",

When we rely on life we know about our country others country and all about life we can relate to others easily. When not everyone is the same, and there are good reliable people you can count on to help. When others whom try to help us, rely on their money and others more experienced to help out when we are seen as unreliable, old and weak that can't take care of ourselves. When we can always count on the things that stood the test of time, newspapers to know the world news, a pet to talk to, and a porch to relax and observe outside. When what we see, we are unhappy to see another house, when we rely upon outside views to relax us. When some views are pleasant to us to see.\n When others don't understand us, we rely on them to leave us alone. When others we easily relate to, we are welcomed when we know what they want and like, we rely on them for a good time and a simple beer. When we rely on others to help us understand those whom are different to us to see what they see about us, and to se how we see about them. When we rely on guidance from others to keep us on the right path, whether we accept it or not, depending on how stubborn we are, or health depends on it. When we are always looking for something to naturally do, when we always relied upon our hands to do the job. When we rely upon our eyes and senses that can put some knowledge and perspective in things to people we relate to and can see eye to eye with. When some good reliable ways of life are still good when they do the trick. When others are constantly relied upon to up hold traditions and cultural practices. When we are unreliable when we are not good at anything. When we are reliable when we do as we are told without any questions why. When we can rely upon the strength we don't have but others have to do some work around the house. When we are old and our body is no longer reliable, we go see a doctor. When whom we see matters when we are comfortable with those whom we known reliable for along time. When we are always let down by others that makes reliability hard to come by. When something is reliable it stands the tests of time. When it is builded strong, made with good materials and quality, it is strong. When we are reliable because we are a great friend and grateful. When what pleases us are things that are reliable. When something we see reliable and old, others might see used and old worth less. When we are a large source of reliability when others whom have less we give, as they return the favour. When reliability is good, when we do good, it makes feel better inside, but weaker to deal with our illnesses. When we enjoy doing as it is reliable when it relaxes us all through tough times is killing us. When we rely on advice and guidance for others to follow, but we refuse to hear. When we rely on understanding one another to know what we like, how and why we treat eachother this way, we rely on ways of communicating that stood the test of time when things never change and nothing is ever good. When we rely on like minded knuckle heads to help us when we are down, but also face the unreliable ones that gouge us financially. When we are reliable, to get us on our feet, to start us up. When others are seen not welcomed when they are seen unreliable to us when we need those to fight. When we rely on ways in battle to fight, what others don't have. What we don't rely on, is some battles ending. When we see a real reliable person, they deserve something as reliable as good old reliable Gran Torino. When whom we are and what we did we are a National hero, we rely on that duty to stray us to the right decision. When we rely on fighting for good, that no man, god or angel can't stop us when we are relied upon to end turrany. When we are reliable to take care of what we know what is coming. When we have our ways when those we relied upon, we thank for a lifetime of business, friendship, and a tip. When we rely upon others to take care of things that have been reliable to us, and made us feel at home. When some things that are reliable, we keep hidden and locked up to remain that way. When times have changed, and we are no longer relied upon to fight a war we can't fight, but relied upon to save others by taking a bullet for them to keep them safe. When our wits of combat came in handy when we we finally rely on the institutions to fight the battle against evil. When somethings we wish not to stick around we protect to serve others and be the reliable person to build faith. When others whom are reliable we wish could stick around but his time is up. And those whom are a drain, unreliable we rely on the law to do its job. \nWhen whom we are, what we did, and the people we chosen to be reliable to give the funeral we would have liked based on how you understood him, and know he would like a wise ass joke read at his funeral. When those whom given us a reason to live when all is dead, we were reliable as much as they were reliable to them.",

The Vietnamese kid lives next door to Walt with his family and is forced to work off his debt that his family imposes om his for trespassing and trying to steal Walt's car. Walk makes him work for 2 weeks straight helpimg fix the neighbors houses, then helps him get a job as a laborer for construction company.

            "content": "Remember when you were a child and your mother said 'Don't pull that face or the wind will change and you may get stuck', Clint Eastwood should have listened. \n\nThe uncomfortable squinting scowling trademark that once carried such an alpha-male menacing glint is now merely a painful movement similar to that of watching paint crack.\n\nIn the hammiest performance of his career, Eastwood once again carries a trifecta of roles; lead actor/director/producer. Sadly in this instant the film is left feeling unbalanced and unpolished. Like Woody Allen before him, there comes a time to step down from playing the lead in your own films.\n\nWalt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a cantankerous and bigoted old coot. Bereaved by the death of his wife the agonisingly narrow-minded man dismisses all forms of comfort and interactions. When well-meaning but cherub-faced priest Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) requests to receive his confession as per the wishes of Walt's wife, he unsurprisingly sneers and begs the question, why would I confess to a \"27-year-old virgin who sells superstition to old ladies\"?\n\nBitter from spending his life supporting 'his America' on the Ford assembly line and frozen in the memories of the Korean war, Walt faces a future with children who don't want to understand him, grandchildren who want his possessions and living in a decaying neighbourhood that in his opinion is overrun with undesirables.\n\nHis irrationally racist and antisocial slurs on all \"slopes, gooks and zipper heads\" are aimed directly at his neighbours; A Hmong family consisting of an equally headstrong grandmother, traditional mother, strong willed daughter Sue and meek directionless son Thoa.\n\nWhen a local gang seek to recruit Thoa (introducing Bee Vang) an altercation erupts and spills over onto Walt's lawn. Immediately defending his property, Walt inadvertently becomes a hero to the local Hmong community who begin to make offerings of gifts and food in thanks, against his protests. \n\nUnwilling to let go, the gang reapproach Thoa. Pressuring him into an initiation they demand vengeance for Walt's insult, Thoa must steal Walt's only remaining pride; a fully restored mint condition 1972 Gran Torino.\n\nThoa succumbs and attempts to take the car. After being almost shredded by Walt's overzealous theft protection system (a shot gun), the domineering family women offer him pay his penance in manual labour. \n\nRefusing at first, Walt is enraged by the offer but reluctantly allows Thoa (whom he dubs \"Toad\") to pay his debt by completing handyman jobs he himself would not do. Walt starts to relent on his faux-contempt when he realises the fatherless boy has the potential to become a decent man and begins to instruct him in the clichés of manliness, handy-work and woman-wooing.  \n\nWalt's demeanour continues to soften when naive tough-nut Sue Lor (Also introducing Ahney Her) is harassed by a group of black thugs, a mixture of guilt and entrenched chivalry towards women prompts Walt to protect her in his usual crass way. \n\nRecognising his newly found tolerance Sue pursues the friendship, Walt soon realises he has more in common with these strangers than he does with his own family. Resemble a normal human being, Walt unwitting assists Thoa in getting a construction job and allows Sue to integrate him into their traditional Hmong gatherings. \n\nLife in the Ghetto is never that simple. No longer harbouring racial bitterness towards his neighbours, when the gang once again returns for their recruit and is faced with a new united front, the atmosphere declines rapidly and inevitably violent showdown ensues. \n\nGran Torino working from a strong script by Nick Schenk, and using an unsophisticated pale wash of colour creates the correct atmosphere for the style. However, the film lacks the potential to be another Eastwood Oscar contender.\n\nSlipping consistently into his one-dimensional Dirty Harry style arrogance, the Walt character seems unexplored for its own unique merit. A further depth of character would have been achieved without the mundane 45 minute hollow introduction, if directed by a second entity.\n\nEastwood's cast is shaky. Surrounding himself with mostly amateur Hmong actors, Vang and Her in their debut roles bring a naivety and immaturity that ads a certain charm in most scenes. This rapport does not carry to other characters, gang members and the grandchildren deliver woefully under par performances. \n\nThe Verdict: This heavy-handed and somewhat melodramatic piece has the classic blaze of glory Clint Eastwood Style. Although self-indulgent and trite in parts, Gran Torino does have at least 25 minutes worth of well-conceived redeeming action, well until Eastwood decides to strangle his skeleton like voice and croak the opening verse of the closing credits.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 30/01/2009",

This film is so full of white supremacist pro patriarchy, pro America, pro military propaganda that it makes my blood curdle. Lone white ex Korean military man saves Hmong immigrant family from terrible Hmong gang and terrible African American hoods. The allusions to Christ are obvious but I won't elaborate so as not to spoil the ending for people. The message imbedded in this film, I believe, is that American militaristic male whitehood is there to save everyone else from themselves so you all can rest easy. Quite the task however it would appear Clint Eastwood believes America and Christ are up to it.",

The script has some great moments, but some dull ones as well. Most of the movie is Kowalski's bond with his troubled young neighbor, and it works really well, if a bit drawn out. It's a bit cheesy at times, but the ending is smart and powerful, and pretty emotional. It's a very well made film I highly recommend. Gran Torino gets 4/5 stars (A-).",

I would have given the movie 4 stars or higher were the ending not so terribly bad.  Not only did it reek to me of old hammy hollywood endings, but the religious symbolism with which he hits us over the head seemed utterly pompous to me.

Few movies have the characters or script this one does, they have great depth, are very well developed, and play important roles.  Half the lines in the movie are quotable, and have become famous.   The plot's about coming of age more of less, coming home a veteran, and being a tough guy.  Dispite the name the car isn't the centrepiece of the film, although it is important. It's an enjoyable watch for anyone, overall a great movie, and is a good laugh as well.   There is a few movies starring an old-guy main character that have great humor, topics, and actors playing them, and this is the number one.  The ending is expected, not the typical action movie ending, but still sad and unfortunate.

I'll also say that the screenplay did sometimes suffer from laziness. When Eastwoods character is transitioning from a miserable grump to an inspirational fatherly figure, they could've been more subtle to show his change instead of; \"Don't call me Walt, call me, Mr Kowalkski\" to \"hey, call me Walt\"! That is my one beef with the screenplay-other than that, I think it nothing less than beautiful, and I do mean beautiful. The film miraculously covers dark subjects whilst simultaneously being very humorous. As of now I haven't seen many Eastwood directed films so it's therefore hard for me to say if it lives up to his usual standard. What I can however say is that this is fantastically directed, powerfully acted, and excellently written.",

I loved this movie because not too often do I see movies anymore that are about characters that aren't very likable and yet the movie itself is good. The movie is about Walt a racist old man who's just very bitter and angry towards most of the people in his life mainly because they don't do the things he expects of them. He hates his next door neighbors for no other reason than they're asian and he just wishes he had people that lived next door to him that were anything but asian. He isn't close to his sons even though he wishes he were and he finds his grandchildren to be disrespectful towards him and his wife who has just passed away. And he hates the pastor of his church for bothering him about coming back to the church and doing confession. Yet even though he dislikes most of these people being involved in his life and you really don't have much love for the because of the way he treats people you really can't help, but feel for the guy because he has his reasons for the being the way he is. I mean it shows in this movie that even though he is racist it seemed to me that he was only racist because he 's trying to convince himself that there is a reason for these people to be hated. He didn't want to kill people like this and he feels guilty for killing them so he hides his guilt by treating them like garbage and being hateful. And throughout this movie there is this ever present tension that is screaming to you something like: \"A gun is gonna go off. A gun is gonna go off.\" And most of the time I assumed that it was going to be Walt that would be the one to pull the trigger, but he never fired a shot throughout this entire movie and yet he was still able to win in every dangerous situation he was in.

Walt is only on speaking terms with his barber; and his dog.\n-- Walt is also hounded by the \"baby-faceed\" parish priest (which Walt says looks as a 27-year old virgin) who, as a promise to Walt`s late wife, is trying to get him to the confession chair.\n-- Due to events, related to Walt`s sports car, a model 1972 Ford Gran Torino\", he is drawn into the life of his two Vietnamese next-door neighbours, the teenagers Thao (\"Toad\")and his sister Sue.\n\nWalt is an old dog with a thick hide, but a heart of gold.

Though the film is not without its flaws, the central message, the motifs of forgiveness, acceptance, and perhaps most importantly, human kinship, carry this film from start to finish. This is an eye-opening film, beautifully directed, and acted by Eastwood and the actual Hmong cast. The story is simply unforgettable. Please watch Gran Torino.

Eastwood's character, Walt, is a newly-widowed Korean War vet who hates everyone. He is racist and foul-mouthed and generally unlikable. He is almost a stereotypical \"get off my lawn\" old man who actually says \"Get off my lawn!\" more than once. Estranged from his own sons, he unexpectedly becomes friendly with the teenage immigrant Hmong neighbours next door. The teens are beset by a Hmong gang of aimless young men, and Walt takes it upon himself to protect his neighbours and to also teach the boy Thao (whom he repeatedly calls \"Toad\") a few things about being a man. When the gang shoots up Thao's home and beat and rape his sister Sue, Walt executes a plan to ensure that the gang members go away. Forever. This being an Eastwood picture, you have certain expectations about how that will play out, but you may find you're only partly right. While I found the film's plot to depend on a collection of highly improbable circumstances and Walt's pop-psychology hang-ups, Eastwood still manages to make us feel that the script's way is the only way to resolve the conflict. There is some genuine emotion in the final act that caught me by surprise.",

            "content": "Gran Torino is a story following Walt Kowalski, played by Clint Eastwood. He's an elderly Korean Vet who's wife recently passed away. His family and him aren't on best terms, and it may or may not be partly due to him being kind of an irritable guy. But soon Walt meets the neighbors, and their son Thao, who's cousin is kind of forcing him into a gang life when he's more of a quiet do your chores and say nothing kind of guy. Thao's initiation is to steal Walt's Gran Torino, and our story goes from there. First off, I would like to give a slow, then eventually up roaring clap for Client Eastwood. Five out of five performance, and Oscar worthy. And all the acting in this movie is good,  nobody really fucks up. And that may be in part due to the characters. Walt I'll do a character review on, but for now just know he really leads the movie through the whole thing. His relationship with Thao is possibly the best part of the movie, he contrasts pretty much every character, and you just love him talking and being a total dick, but an otherwise good guy. As for Thao, you really feel his rise to being a man and standing up for himself something unique. Not many movies have an old guy for a main character, and has an Asian friend who he is turning into a man. So that right there it is unique. And as far as the story goes, it works. Not every scene is super attention grabbing, a lot don't really hold much purpose. It's a simple movie with simple story, but really starts to shake up right around the end. That being said, this is one of those movies with lots of dialogue, and lots of those scenes that just add a little flavor for a character but otherwise don't do anything. Not that's bad, the execution is great, but it's not like the Shawshank Redemption where even though it's a lot of dialogue, each scene grabs you and holds a lot of information. With Gran Torino it's not entirely like that, it's kind of slow, and you do have to sit down at watch it. And not every scene grabs you. But I still love the movie, it's still fantastic. The Gran Torino itself it tells Walt's personality, and it's basically his pride. And the little town they make in this movie I like. I love how Walt is telling really racist jokes in a town where he's the minority. The movie has a lot of these little variables, and ultimately they all feel complete in the end. And this is the kind of movie I'll pick up every couple of years, and each time I put it in, it'll almost feel brand new again, and feel fresh in my mind. I don't think it'll get the long-lasting badge because I'd get sick of this movie if I had to watch it twice in one week, but over a span of time, it's still has longevity, just not enough for that badge. And the first time I saw this was in theaters, and it was a really cool experience. It leaves a really good memory. And I said how this movie had a lot of little variables, and I will say each variable felt like it was really worked on. Each personality, each sentence of dialogue, the closure, it all felt like each knew where it wanted it to be. And is this a great movie? Hell yeah it is. Movies are suppose to be this. They are suppose to show personalities and worlds, and they reflect meaning and or are just a good time. This falls under more of the first category, but still a movie I don't really know anyone who has a problem with, even people who only watch funny movies. It's a great movie, hits everywhere it needs, and is worth having in any collection. And remember, get off Walt's lawn.",

Having a father in his mid-nineties that refuses to lay down in a nursing home bed and wait to die, I can identify with Eastwood's character and his advocacy for the older generation of our society. These are the ones who took care of things they had and made saving money a habit rather than running up debt. He had received derisive criticism from the media for his monologue at the Republican National convention as a senile old codger talking to a chair but Obama wouldn't have the guts to breathe in the presence of Mr. Eastwood or anyone of his caliber let alone debate him.  Back to the film.  I would have liked to see more interplay and development from Walt's children than the typical kids \"waiting for Dad to die so they can get the inheritance\" that has been played as a trope on a number of comedies and murder mysteries.  It felt necessary to further move the relationship closer to the Hmong family as Walt seemed an unwanted figurehead and patriarch of his own blood relations.  The villain here is not the racist American culture or white skinhead thugs but members of the Hmong immigrants that have adopted the hip-hop gangsta drug/crime lifestyle of so many inner-city youth with no ambition to excellence but to live for cheap thrills of harassing the weak and helpless of their own kind.  Interesting juxtaposition where the antagonists of both protagonist in this film come from their own family/tribe.  The climax with the shootout proves that Mr. Eastwood even in his advanced years still has it.  Knowing the final showdown and justice needing to be served will necessitate his ultimate sacrifice without him firing a shot does not lessen the poignancy of this scene. It is a callback to his earlier day in cinema where he epitomized the iconic Man-with-no-Name anti-hero and the gunfight at the end where it's all made right.  The usual Eastwood produced and directed film.  Great to watch with family.  There is some language however.",

Ahney Her and Bee Vang charmed me; but the rest of the cast, excluding Eastwood, felt somewhat muted. However, there was enough development through the intriguing story line to carry the film through. I read this on the brilliant review done by film.com: 'Clint carries the film - both as star and director - on his formidable shoulders.' I agree with this to a certain extent, but it's prejudiced to give Eastwood all the credit.
