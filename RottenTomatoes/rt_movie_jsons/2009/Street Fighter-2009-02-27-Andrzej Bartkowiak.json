Everyone is honestly ok outside of the miscasting's but the miscasting's drag down the performances to subpar. The cinematography is ok and the fight scenes are generic and forgettable. So is the musical score as well. The editing and pacing are not good in this. This movie can't decide if it wants to be a Police thriller or Kung-Fu movie and really never makes the two work together. While there definitely is more focused a plot here than in 94' it still loses focus sometimes and it drags and never really keeps tension. I can definitely understand why hardcore Street Fighter fans hate this. But anyone else its just a subpar Action Movie. Skip This.",

The cast is pretty decent, the story well-paced, and the action is professionally mounted. It's still junk, but at least it's competently-made junk. The skinny-minnie at the center of this, Kristin Kreuk, isn't exactly the most engaging leading lady, but she's cute and looks convincing in her fights and stunts. Chris Klein (of 'American Pie' fame) tries to show some edge as an Interpol agent but is too bland to pull it off. Exotic-looking Moon Bloodgood (is that her real name?) is more interesting as his partner. Neal McDonough, with his steel-blue eyes and white hair, is always a scary-looking villain. As is the man-mountain known as Michael Clarke Duncan. Robin Shou, who played Liu Kang in those 'Mortal Kombat' movies so long ago, has aged into a credible martial arts guru who trains our heroine. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak did 'Romeo Must Die,' 'Exit Wounds,' 'Cradle 2 the Grave,' and the movie version of 'Doom,' so don't expect much. The story is nothing more than a revenge tale, with masked thugs dressed in black as generic fighting foes. The dialogue and voice-over narration is laughably arch. In the end, though, this surpassed my expectations, if only a little",

The actors are painfully miscast. While Michael Clarke Duncan is the lone bright spot, the other actors are just bland. The action sequences, while not AS bad as I expected them to be, still came off as rather absurd. And unlike the '94 feature, these are all healthy-looking actors whose fighting is meant to be taken seriously. The Legend of Chun-Li isn't a Street Fighter movie, it's a terrible martial arts feature whose characters just happen to share the same name as those from the hit Capcom games. Definitely a video game movie that's forgettable at best and utterly dreadful trash at worst.",

Good production values and location shooting with the occasional action beat. Considering this is currently at number 76 of the 100 worst movies of all time on the IMDB list,  the low expectations do it some favors as well. Both Kristin Kreuk as the titular star and Moon Bloodgood as a detective are watchable and refreshing. In addition, Michael Clarke Duncan is clearly having fun and his enthusiasm is infectious. \n\nThe Bad: Entire doctoral thesis has been written about all the things wrong with the movie. Among the various sins child actors that look nothing like their adult counterparts (to the point of being a clearly different nationality), Chris Klein is awful and drags down every scene he is in, Chris Klein is in way too many scenes, and the villain makes no sense.\n\nThe Ugly: Here we get to the crux of the hatred for this unremarkable action film. Street Fighter fans. This is, by any measure, a terrible adaptation of the source material. Now I have to admit my eyes glaze over when rabid fandoms go on the attack because the backstory written to sell some toys and fill five minutes of a twenty-four-minute cartoon is treated as if Moses himself brought it down from the mountain. (I am looking your way Transformers fans), but Street Fighter fans have an understandable beef.\n\nAs source material goes Street Fighter is a pretty thin gruel. Unlike many modern video games, Street Fighter has more in common with Pac-Man or Donkey Kong than say The Last of Us. You have colorful characters and a fighting tournament outside of that a screenwriter pretty much has carte blanche to do what he wants with the story. Guess what this movie does not have? If you said a fighting tournament and colorful characters guess what you win a prize.\n\n\nIn Conclusion: Clearly, the screenwriter had a Tomb Raider script sitting in a dusty drawer (The film makes much more sense as a Tomb Raider reboot than a Street Fighter one) and got a call from his agent. Meh, one video game is the same as another just change Lara Croft to Chun Li and change the Irish real estate mogul into Bison and we are good to go. No need to change the plot about the cave of soul cleansing or the mysterious scroll or the heroine living alone in the mansion with servants after her father's disappearance. \n\n\nDecent B movie action film but in all fairness a horrible adaptation of the source material.",

He's the equivalent of Justin Chatwin as Goku in Dragonball Evolution (Another godawful cinema atrocity). Nothing makes sense, the plot is messy and incoherent. Kristin Kreuk as Chun-Li? atrocious. Chris Klein as Charlie Nash? Atrocious. Taboo as Vega? ATROCIOUS. Robin Shou as Gen, Neal McDonough as M. Bison, and Michael Duncan as Balrog are okay, however. Michael Dunkan as Balrog is the closest thing to being faithful to the video games. M. Bison as an Irish? Well, I know a lot about Street Fighter, and rumor has it he's either from Cambodia, Thailand, or Ireland. So don't mind the Irish nationality much. I also felt really bad for Neal McDonough. He tried his best to make his piece of garbage work, but he couldn't because the writing, the dialogue, the screenplay, everything was awful. Same case for Robin Shou. He tried his best, but his efforts hindered by incompetent amateurs in the film industry. \n\nVerdict: 1/10. F-. Atrocious. Godawful.

            "content": "Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li is a 2009 martial arts action thriller film directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak, written by Justin Marks, and starring Kristin Kreuk, Neal McDonough, Michael Clarke Duncan, Chris Klein, Moon Bloodgood, Robin Shou, Taboo, Josie Ho, and Elizaveta Kiryukhina. The film is based on Capcom's Street Fighter video games and is a reboot of the 1994 film Street Fighter.\n\nWhen she was younger, Chun-Li (Kristin Kreuk) witnesses the kidnapping of her father Xiang by the wealthy Irish crime lord M. Bison (Neal McDonough), the CEO of Shadaloo Headquarters. Years later, she goes into a quest for vengeance and becomes the famous crimefighter of the Street Fighter universe.\n\nI was introduced to the Street Fighter universe when I bought Street Fighter IV for the Xbox 360 a few years earlier, and I loved it. A wide variety of characters, fun gameplay, inventive fighting styles and powers... it was pure awesomeness. I also bought the updated version of the game, Super Street Fighter IV, and I loved that even more.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, I rented the 1994 live-action Street Fighter film from Family Video. The Steven E. de Souza-written and directed film starred Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile (tremendous miscast), Ming-Na Wen as Chun-Li, and Raul Julia as M. Bison (best part of the film). While very different from the games, I gotta admit, I had a bit of fun with this film. It's bad, yes, but I'd consider it a guilty pleasure. However, that film is Oscar-worthy cinema compared to this abomination.\n\nIf you thought the 1994 film was a terrible adaptation of the games, take a look at this shitstorm. This film rapes pretty much everything people loved about this franchise up the ass. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak (whose previous films I did enjoy) and screenwriter Justin Marks make absolutely no attempt to try to follow the games and that pisses me off.\n\nThe performances are awful, with the three exceptions being Neal McDonough, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Robin Shou. Despite his truly horrendous Irish accent, McDonough was trying very hard to make this generic, non-threatening bad guy work, and Shou was mildly entertaining as Gen. Sadly, Marks' dismally-penned script and Bartkowiak's tenuous, amazingly effortless direction prevent McDonough and Shou from being allowed to truly shine.\n\nMichael Clarke Duncan as Balrog is admittedly a delight. You can tell he's having a blast playing this guy. Not to mention, Balrog is the only character who bears any resemblance to his video game counterpart. Kristin Kreuk is atrocious as Chun-Li, which is a real shame, given that I loved her as Lana Lang on Smallville. Her line delivery is just abysmal and she shows hardly any genuine emotion.\n\nMoon Bloodgood is bland (although sexy) as Maya Sunee, who becomes Crimson Viper in the video games. Taboo as Vega is a tremendous miscast, one of the biggest in film history. However, the worst performance comes from Chris Klein as Charlie Nash (Blanka from the games). Klein looks beyond bored to be in this film and he sounds as if he's a petulant five-year-old doing a bad Christian Slater impersonation. Phenomenally awful.\n\nIf you watch this film expecting some bad-ass fight scenes, you'll be disappointed. The action scenes in this movie are pitiful. Andrzej Bartkowiak directs the action and fight scenes with no skill, effort, passion, or energy, and not to mention, they're very poorly edited by Derek G. Brechin and Niven Howie, and the choreography is nothing short of a joke. They even use Chun-Li's signature Spinning Bird Kick with truly deplorable results. However, the cinematography by Geoff Boyle is occasionally crisp, so there's that.\n\nThe whole affair is just a tired, generic mess all around. Stephen Endelman's musical score is insipid and flavorless beyond definition, there are countless martial arts and action film clich\u00e9s, and there's not even a lick of originality and creativity to be found. The visual effects are spectacularly horrible. There's one bit five minutes into the movie where Chun-Li's father attacks a guy by using a bottle of wine as a water pistol, with the wine being as clear as water. The CGI for the wine is just... blecch. I mean, dear God.\n\nJustin Marks' screenplay is reprehensible. Hardly any character development, really god-awful dialogue, and a story so redundant, outrageously ridiculous, and nonsensical you'll want to pull your hair out. Not to mention, the tone is completely wrong. It takes itself so goddamn seriously. What dumb-ass wanted a dark, gritty, more realistic version of Street Fighter? What the fuck.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 1/10\n\nStreet Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li is bar none one of the worst video game movies ever made. Holy mother of God was this terrible. Bad writing, bad acting, bad action, bad story, bad characters, bad adaptation, bad reboot, bad movie. The 1994 film may not have been good, but hey, at least it was fun. This, however, is not enjoyable in the slightest. Fuck this movie and never, ever watch it.",

Sorry to see that not many of the characters from the original video game have made an appearance in this film though, probably because the majority of it is based around Chun Li as the title suggests. It's basically about her fight to rescue her father, who was kidnapped by the big boss himself, Major Bison - and what a formidable baddy he is too, it always took me hours to beat him up on the final stages of the game! Along the way, there are several battles and Kung fu style fight scenes as you would expect, which to their credit attempt to mirror the classic attributes of their individual game characters. There are also a number of not so combative cast members who I presume have been employed to boost ratings I.e. Chris Klein from American Pie, Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas, and the late Michael Clarke Duncan, who performs the very fitting character of Balrog, a big meathead boxer. It's good harmless fun, but probably not recommendable if you are genuinely after a quality Kung fu film and have no prior knowledge of the video game. Even despite my familiarity with it, it's still quite a disappointment to see such an absence of classic characters, plus the key battles were all a bit of an anticlimax as some of the so called invincibles were beaten after just a few hits, including the big man Bison himself! I guess when you employ non-combat actors to perform kick-ass roles, their fight scenes are always going to be a tad limiting though! Still, I'll always love bashing away aimlessly at the control pad in a game of 'Street Fighter', just won't ever be as crazy about this movie!",

            "content": "This movie was so bad that I have to give the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Oscars for being a success and yet not getting much credit. The story was boring, there were rarely any action scenes in it and when there were any, they looked like they were choreographed by an 8-year old, even the montage. The music wasn't even that catchy, the scenes felt like they had been ripped off another movie and the actors we like are wasted and the ones we don't should be doomed. While the games focused on Ryu and Ken and sort of Chun-Li because she was the lead actress in the games, this movie focuses heavily on her only as the title says so. Kristin Kreuk looks nothing like Chun-Li and whenever she does, she's either not fighting or not wearing her blue outfit and whenever she does fight, it doesn't look the least bit realistic infact all the stunt choreography/ fight scenes are horrible and there's only like 3 or five of them including a training montage so that we can build up to the big vengeful climatic battle.  In this movie, Chun-Li's a pianist which is an even worst origin than a reporter who's seeking revenge on M.Bison because they captured her parents well at least they got that right. There is one scene where I thought she actually looked like Chun-Li and she was doing this mystical ball kind of thing that her master taught him and yet she wasn't wearing her blue costume and her hair was in a pony tail which is what killed it off. Ming-Na Wen who voiced Mulan played Chun-Li in the 1994 version looked more like Chun-Li and she didn't even need the blue outfit. Nash played by Oz from American Pie is supposed to be Guile's friend or brother but has turned into one of the most annoying characters in video game history. What happened to the goody-goody singing sportsman Chris Fucking Ostriecher from American Pie? He's now turned into total annoyance but wait, Tara Reid being a cliche scientist in Alone In The Dark is much worst. He is the lead actor and he doesn't do jack shit other than spew annoying single-dialogues and be little-useful in the climax with one pistol again that killed it off. Neal McDonough who plays M.Bison can't even feel Raul Julia's shoes. Do you know what Raul had he had to go through before when he got the role of M.Bison? It was requested by his children so he chose it as his last movie ever plus he even died before the film's release and so the film was dedicated to him. That was a lot of hard work put into one man in one movie. Here it's the total opposite. At least that movie got his origins right, In this he's a fucking businessman! He doesn't even look like M.Bison; Instead he looks like Tony Stark's stepfather. Robin Shou who played Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat plays Chun-Li's master Gen and that's another talent wasted. Robin, you're better off as Liu Kang. Go back to Mortal Kombat, you're better off there and don't even bother if the special effects in MK2 are one of the worst, you can survive that movie, but you can't survive this. Balrog isn't too bad as he's played by Michael Clarke Duncan and to be honest and fair, he was the only enjoyable character in this movie. He does some pretty crazy street gangster black guy's shit LIKE A STREET FIGHTER WOULD DO! Taboo from The Black Eyed Peas plays Vega and rarely does anything and is even more useless than Nash. Vega  is one of the coolest characters out there because of his wolverine-like claws and instead gets taken out like a bitch the second time we see him. The first time we see him, he's in action killing M.Bison's businessmen but it takes place off-screen in fact that's another talent being wasted. Moon Bloodgood plays the Crimson Viper and she's hot but she does nothing Crimson Viper-related which is kind of a shame so you can see how bad this movie is. It's broken, lame, annoying, depressing, tiring, childhood-damaging, boring, ridiculous, severely-miscasted, terrible, IT'S JUST BAD! Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun Li gets a 3/10.",

And turning Bison from a wacky cape wearing psychotic dictator super villian into a irish blond haired psychotic gangster with streaks of misogny isn't helping. And  Ming-Na had better charisma than Kreuk as Chun-Li, plus she was more asian  than Kreuk.

I can say that Kristen Kreuk (chun-li) did a great job, showing the audience that she can hold her own in a leading role as a female action heroine. Chris Klien (Nash) was just bad, he overacted every scene he was in which made me laugh out loud because I just couldn't take him seriously... he constantly had this acting method as if he was in a porn or trying to channel Christian Slater. The story had a lot of plot holes and climax events that didn't make sense... having you question why they were doing what they were doing and what the hell for? Taboo of Black Eyed Peas fame, played the role of Vega, which if anyone ever played the Street Fighter games would know that vega is a beautiful, blonde, vain, prick. Taboo has a face only a mother could love. There a weird lesbian club scene, chinese actors with broken english and bad wigs, and a villian with an irish accent that goes in and out. If you get interested in seeing a street fighter movie, just rent the 1994 Jean Claude Van Dame version. This movie was just bad.... yeesh.",

            "content": "This is why a film should not be adapted from a video game. The film is a sequel to another video-game adaptation called Street Fighter, that being said we know that we are heading towards a disaster. The plot of this film is about Chun-Li a young pianist whose father is kidnapped by a dude named Bison. As Chun-Li grows she realizes who are the men whom captured his father and now she must learn martial arts to hunt down the men whom took a way his father. Chun-Li goes to Bangkok and finds how much terrible the citizens are living with Bison's Iron Fist. \r\nThe film is freaking terrible. Is not that there is a lot of action and little story, is that the action sequences are poor, dull and surprisingly boring. There's a scene in this movie in which the girl jumps from one house to another and you can clearly see the cable on top of her. None of the fight scenes made me say wow except at the climax when she breaks the neck of a person. That is it! Another scene is with Chun-Li fighting against another woman (whom supposedly is one of the greatest fighters in the video game) and Chun-Li only grabs her hair for like 5 seconds and instantly the lady gives up. There is no hype in this movie everything in this movie goes to fast or happens absolutely nothing. \r\nThe movie is short and they did something terrible with the pace. The film went just too fast for example that dad is fighting a couple of bad guys, they look really strong. Then Mr. Bison comes in, which looks as the weakest of all the bad guys, and the father instantly gives up. With no struggle at all, just like that he gives up. We don't see Mr. Bison fight until the end of the movie and he is supposed to be the Big Bad Boss of this entire movie but he isn't. He is not even menacing, he tells the protagonist: \"You will not stop me.\" In the most hideous, dullest way I have ever seen in my entire life.  \r\nThe problem with video-game films is that they look like video-games and we are not here to waste our money to watch video-games, we are here to watch movies and this is not a movie. Films should have characters, a plot, cool action sequences but this did not buy anything that had in this movie. The screenplay is just terrible up to the point you want to vomit. It did not explain everything what was going on and you felt completely alienated. Another problem with video-game films is that there's nothing fresh in them. Absolutely nothing. I mean is like I was watching another dumb and pathetic kung-fu movie. \r\nWhat I like about this film is that it meet with my expectations. I thought this movie was going to be bad and it was a bad movie. What I like about this movie is that it had a narrator so that we don't get lost while watching this movie. The film has a story is about justice, about finding your father and don't let nothing stand in your way. This film could have been much better. \r\nThis film was directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak whom most of his films are about action movies. So don't expect to see a good film about this guy. He seriously need to get better on his movies, even do he is more of a cinematographer than a director. The directing was this film was really terrible up to the point that makes you want to leave the film. \r\nI would recommend this movie to people that love video-game films because it lacks everything else. I mean if you like films with dull and boring action sequences then this is the film for you guys because this film really bored me to death.",
