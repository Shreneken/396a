Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims.",

            "content": "This movie faced a lot of criticism and controversy upon its release, and despite the controversy never stopping, it seems more appreciated today. However, I understand both points of view. On the one hand, A Clockwork Orange is very garish, strident, and bawdy whether with its story, script, or filming. But on the other hand, it has a unique plot, great performances, and magnificent camerawork from Stanley Kubrick (which is generally expected from him). This movie is not made for kicking back and relaxing, and one needs to be in a specific mood.",

Like Joker's helmet in Full Metal Jacket; Peace sign: Born to kill. I think Alex in this movie is born to kill. And he enjoys it. I'm not sure if Kubrick thinks this is problematic. What he does find problematic is Alex's so called rehabilitation. Why? Because it is wrong to take away a humans ability to choose between right and wrong. But what about the way Alex was living his life; part of a gang; hurting innocent people? I'm afraid the real edge to this movie is that it is so silent when it comes to that. In fact, the film seems to want us to sympathize with Alex when the tables are turned. Alex however is very charming; ultra charming; I think that's where this movie gets its lasting appeal. His charm seems to be rooted in a little of that ultra violence. I think in his way Stanley Kubrick was illustrating the kind of person who becomes a dictator; and showing how such an individual could get away with doing hideous deeds.",

But that is not a negative thing, it accomplished exactly what it was trying to. If you can handle intense violence and sexual content, then give it a try. It isn't made for people like Alex--although, it may seem like that to a few. This film is made to make you think, and make you consider moral goodness. It's meant to make you uncomfortable.

One thing I admired about this film was the use of sound and music, I could see similarities to The Shining in that respect with Kubrick using sound in a disturbing and unconventional way to make a scene even more bizarre than it already is.

Furthermore, for a film to be a masterpiece, it must have music, direction, and great performances by the cast. Nevertheless, this film easily fulfills these requirements, and miraculously, it is a perfect work of art, with outstandingly high quality visual beauty far above the audience. For 136 minutes, one feels as if one has stepped into an exhibition of paintings or photographs that are sigh-inducingly vivid, beautiful, sometimes violent, and sometimes insane. The film's elaborate camerawork is erotic, but not vulgar, like a sensual film. The clarity of vision, both pictorial and photographic, is unparalleled. Any of the scenes, even the still ones, would make a grade-A photo book. Without a doubt, it is the best film made in the entire world in 1971. It deserves to be the \"Piet\u00e0\" of the film world.",

From Cain killing Abel to US mass murders this year, humans seem to can't get out of their own way. This is at once a sad observation about life, a satire on how people, governments try to deal with this penchant for destruction, maybe more superficial than intellectually honest, and a poke in the eye, as whether either free will and choice vs. drug or psychological control of people can work on civility without disrespecting the people. The imagery in this and gross illustration of sex and violence pull no punches. Kubrick wants us to feel it as much as see it. The overall warning is that no matter how hard it is to figure this out, we ought to do it, so that civility and common courtesy and common decency have a chance. To say Kubrick is not optimistic about us doing that may be right. But maybe the whole point of his art is to get us moving, not just appreciating the art. This was beyond groundbreaking, and probably has gotten people talking  for 50 years about interventions that can work without thwarting human nature yet minimizing abuse and destruction we so often visit upon one another.",

There's much about it that doesn't represent \"real\" human emotions, but it does ask some very interesting philosophical questions, especially about the nature of violence and appropriate punishment.

Stanley Kubrick's work becomes a movie classic when he manages to mix violence with a light and fun language, in the scene where they invade the writer's house and sing \"Sing in the rain\" while spacing and abusing the residents is an example. . The film, in addition to the scenes of violence and sex, addresses important themes such as social behavior and the consequence of a world that does not care about the attitudes of the subject, but about the media reception and politics.",

Faithful to the Anthony Burgess source material, Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is a nightmare come to life.  McDowell is nothing short of fantastic in the lead role, simultaneously charming and terrifying.  It's immediately identifiable as a Kubrick film \u2013 long takes, almost imperceptibly slow zooms, and all of the other Kubrick traits evident in his work from 2001: A Space Odyssey onward.  There are moments that either don't work or are inconsistent with the style (the fast motion menage-a-trois scene, for example), but it remains a memorable landmark film.",

I decided to watch it again recently forty years later and was impressed that it held up so well. But, it is a product of its time no doubt. Malcolm McDowell's performance is still great and has a witty, devious hilarity to it at times as in his conversation with some power seeking political leader who wants to use him for political gain while fork feeding him pieces of steak.",

It is probably Kubrick's most controversial film, but it is also one of his most fascinating at the same time. It is the sort of movie that you need to see more than once though, I didn't think much of it first time I love it and appreciate it much more now for what it set out to do.\n\nA Clockwork Orange is a shocking film I give you that, particularly with the rape and sadistic ultra-violence in the first half, and the scenes where Alex is being brainwashed do bring forth ambiguous messages. Still, like with the rest of Kubrick's work it is very well made, has a haunting soundtrack that fits wonderfully with the tone of the film(especially loved the use of the Beethoven), superb writing and direction from Kubrick and a compelling story that evokes thought afterword complete with a purposefully unrepentent ending. Also Malcolm McDowell is absolutely superb in what I consider the performance of his career.\n\nIn conclusion, very fascinating film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It has some fascinating political undertones. It is a full circle movie where the story makes sense from beginning to end referencing earlier encounters and making every shot important.

Undeniably a SUBSTANCE OVER STYLE kind unlike Pulp Fiction that was just short-lived and no true character development. \n\nIn A Clockwork Orange, it did not just emphasize the psychological reality of the young transitioning to critical phases of their lives filled with impulsivity, or that they may just be mixed in the wrong influence; instead, it lead to the revelation of a misunderstood world and that the protagonist-antagonist is in fact by privileged nurture and nature, the sick monster that he is. On the other hand, I absolutely love the play of words the entire movie. The script must be such an interesting read every time they rehearse and THE ENERGY OF THE ACTORS at every scene is just magnificent! The dilemma of the movie hits social issues right on the spot. Truly a worth it film to watch and treasure. The irony at the end was just fitting. I would never forget the iconic totality of this gem. \n\nPS EVAN PETERS LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE HIM I CANNOT \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f",

It does hold up after 50 years.  Malcom MacDowell's performance is brilliant.   About half way through the film the essential question is asked \"if a man is forced to be good and this is not his choice; then is he really good?  Is he really a man?\"  What is the essence of goodness, and what is free will?   The film is supposed to be closely based on the acclaimed novel; however, I have not read it.  Kubrick's filmmaking is stunning, unique, brutal, and violent.   The images are disturbing.   This looks at the conflict over the views on the nature of man, and that view impacts the response to crime and violence.   50 years later I feel the questions are the same, and we are no closer to answers.   Law and order people may argue it doesn't matter whether good behavior is the result of free will; it is the result we seek.  The humanist may not be so happy with that approach regardless of positive outcome.  Aside from Other Kubrick films few movies evoke such conversations and thoughts.  The visuals are cinematically original and visually, truly unique to Kubrick.",
