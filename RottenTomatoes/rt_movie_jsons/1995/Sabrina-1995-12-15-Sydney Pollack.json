    "summary": "Sabrina Fairchild (Julia Ormond) is a chauffeur's daughter who grew up with the wealthy Larrabee family. She always had unreciprocated feelings for David (Greg Kinnear), the family's younger son and playboy. But after returning from Paris, Sabrina has become a glamorous woman who gets David's attention. His older, work-minded brother Linus (Harrison Ford) thinks their courtship is bad for the family business and tries to break them up -- but then he starts to fall for her too.",

Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn are a tough act to follow no matter how good Ford and Ormand's chemistry is. The pace felt slower than it needed to be and some changes were unnecessary, but it remains a charming romance nonetheless.",

            "content": "Firstly, I should say that I don't particularly like the original movie either.\nI was never entirely convinced that Sabrina was actually in love with Linus or him with her. It's never entirely clear how much of his feelings are truly attached to her or if he's simply in love with the idea of being in love. This is a man who hasn't really engaged with his emotions much until the point where he tries to steal Sabrina away from his brother for purely materialistic reasons.\nHis approach is cynical from the start and I'm never fully convinced that a man who has for decades been so emotionally detached and so driven by the pursuit of hard cash and power is really in love. I think a deep and lasting attachment would take more time to develop and some radical changes in perspective. Which just doesn't happen. Perhaps I'm as cynical as Linus but if Bogart couldn't convince me his character was actually in love and not simply enjoying a novel situation then Mr Ford cannot be too greatly criticized for failing as well.\nFrankly, I confess to being really irritated by these ugly duckling stories that involve women cutting their long wavy/curly hair and discarding their glasses, yes I mean you Princess Diaries. I find this trope trite and irritating. I hate to shatter Hollywood delusions but it is possible to have long curly hair and glasses and be attractive,  I hoped this movie would ditch that old chestnut but it doesn't.\nI find both David and Linus to have unattractive personalities and keep feeling that Sabrina is far more in love with their life style than them. I'm not suggesting she's a gold digger, far from it. She was hooked as a child and starry eyed at their glamorous lifestyle. It's a love of fairytale glamour she has not managed to shake off.\nYes, the brothers lifestyle is a fairytale to her and it is intended as one for audience as well but perhaps because I'm a Brit the American dream the brothers represent doesn't appeal to me. Pursuing, it in their own different ways, has made both men rather selfish. \nTo me Linus does not grow during the course of the movie and if he and Sabrina deserve each other, it is perhaps only because both of them in their own way are just a tad needy. Sabrina for a father figure firmly centred in the real world and not in a book and Linus because he wants to see the world through her less jaded eyes. On the surface he seems, by the end of the movie, a better man than his brother, but is that really saying much? \nAt the end of both movies the 1954 and 1995 one I switched off the TV in the firm belief that if the leads were a real couple their marriage was not likely to be a forever thing. You have to believe in the romance in a book or movie for it to be truly and satisfyingly entertained. I did not believe in this romance.",

One of the movies I didnt expect much from was Sabrina, but I remember liking it a lot, so I was excited to give it another shot. Im a sucker for simple romantic movies, and this is about as simple as they come. It wont take long before anybody watching will be able to guess how it ends. Julia Ormond is charming as the titular character, and I thought her transformation was presented in a way that was believable. She didnt just become a different person in a heartbeat, but there were logical steps she goes through. Greg Kinnear feels a little too much like an every man to be the suave lady-killer he portrays in this film, but hes off screen for a long stretch of the movie, so I let it go. The real question mark in this cast is Harrison Ford. When I watched Sabrina this time I kept trying to decide if Ford was disinterested and therefore playing the part somewhat flat, or if he was making a choice to portray his character that way. There wasnt much chemistry between Ford and Ormond either, and part of that might be the obvious age difference. What keeps me interested in Sabrina is the story. Its a sweet tale about people who arent what they seem, and the difficulties that love can bring into your life. I wasnt as enamored with the film this time around, and I dont think its one Ill add to my collection, but its not a bad movie at all.",

The chauffeur's daughter is romanced by both ultra-rich brothers.  Despite what the majority of professional movie critics say, this is an example of a remake that is far better than the original.  Julia Ormond is a far better actress than the overrated Audrey Hepburn, and also far more attractive.  The vastly underrated Harrison Ford's performance is far better than the subpar effort Bogart gave in the original, perhaps in part because he was playing opposite Hepburn, who he found unattractive and a mediocre actress.  The script was better in the remake (perhaps because the original ran into time pressure) and the love story became more believable because of it.  Finally, although it is politically incorrect to say so, the remake was in color, which greatly improved the viewing experience of this film.

Oldest brother Linus (played by Harrison Ford) is the formal, dour businessman, running the family company.  David (Greg Kinnear) is a playboy.  Among the staff living on the estate is the family chauffeur, Fairchild (John Wood), and his shy, awkward, plain daughter, Sabrina (Julia Ormond).  Sabrina has had a crush on David for most of her life but he has hardly noticed her.  Sabrina goes to study in Paris and comes back, two years later, a changed woman.  She's sophisticated and beautiful and soon catches David's eye.  However, David is engaged to Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), the daughter of a business mogul whose company Linus wants to merge with that of the Larrabees.  If Sabrina wrecks the David-Elizabeth relationship it would likely spell the end of the business merger.  Linus sets out to prevent Sabrina from getting in the way but in the process falls for her himself.\n\nThe original Sabrina was released in 1954 and was pretty good (though not brilliant).   Directed by one of the all-time greats, Billy Wilder, and starring Humphrey Bogart as Linus, Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina and William Holden as David, it oozed class and style ( though substance was in shorter supply).  Plot was charming though a bit clumsy and not entirely solid.  Some elements were too convenient or too contrived.  Bogart and Holden were too old for their roles but Audrey Hepburn more than made up for this, capturing the beauty, sweetness, charm and elegance of Sabrina perfectly.\n\nThis 1995 remake faithfully follows the original plot, while updating the settings, technology etc to 1995.  However, the director and writer didn't seem to put much effort into updating the characters, as all they seem like they are 1950s characters in a 1990s movie.  There's a stuffiness to it all that is quite irritating.  Some contemporisation of the characters was in order.\n\nWhere this stuffiness is most noticeable is with Julia Ormond as Sabrina.  Sure, it would have been impossible to find someone to fill Audrey Hepburn's shoes, but Ormond doesn't even come close.  She is beautiful and elegant but lacks Hepburn's charm, sweetness and warmth, coming across as aloof and wooden.\n\nOverall, a reasonable romantic-drama, but not a must-see.",

At first I perceived Sabrina as poorly portrayed, but as I got to know her throughout the film I realized that Ormond gave Sabrina an image that can be related to in many ways. The falling for a man, how she discovers herself and through that she sees the world in a beautiful way. In the way that she doesn't need a man's love for her to love who she is.\nNot only is this film a good motivation for women but it shows a lot about the American working population compared to the European working population.\nthrough this movie you discover that Europeans know how to live, and love what they live for. They know how to work hard but most importantly they know  how to stop working and enjoy themselves now. Americans look for that AMERICAN DREAM (the financial stability to last their lives). Americans work so hard all the time for something in the future instead of living now when they can.\nSabrina repeats the notion that working constantly is too much and playing is never going to be enough. In Europe, they understand balance between working and relaxing for their own personal enjoyment. They understand that life is meant to lived right now not in the future.\nI loved this movie! the humor is great when you are paying attention to the dialog and keep up with the plot.",

            "content": "A remake of the 1954 Billy Wilder movie, this one doesn't quite live up to the original, although there are a few things it does better. Harrison Ford is Linus Larabee, the eldest son of the wealthy Larabee family, who must intervene to prevent his younger brother David (Greg Kinnear) from running off with their chauffeur's daughter Sabrina (Julia Ormond). You see, David is engaged to the daughter of a business tycoon whose company the Larabees want to buy -- no wedding, no merger.\n\nIn the original film, Linus's wooing of Sabrina is never presented as anything other than an attempt to keep her from David. In this remake, it's more ambiguous what Linus's intentions are. This is partly because Harrison Ford is a better actor than Humphrey Bogart in the original, but for a character who's supposed to be a stone-cold businessman, his ability to fool Sabrina and the audience seems too unlikely.\n\nThe humour in the remake isn't as broad or obvious. This is a more subtle film, but for that reason is also less entertaining. I will say, however, that the motives and behaviour of the characters in the finale of the remake are more believable than those of the original.\n\nThe remake follows the plot of the original very closely, much more than most remakes I've seen. I think the script ties itself in knots trying to find a modern way of portraying 1950s attitudes. This film might have done better to take more liberties with the plot.",

Poor Julia Ormand can't quite fill the shoes left by Hepburn.\r\n\r\nSabrina (Ormand) is the daughter of the chauffeur to the rich Larrabee's of Long Island.  She has been in awe of them while growing up.  After a trip to Paris, Sabrina returns home a much more sophisticated woman than when she left.  She catches the eye of the youngest Larrabee son, David (Greg Kinnear).  His scheming older brother tries to guide David to a better marriage so he makes his move on Sabrina, but starts to fall under her spell as well.\r\n\r\nThis reamke is not terrible, but there is no fire to it.  Nothing special to set it apart or make it memorable in the least.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/Sabrina_zps5cbf8f0f.jpg[/IMG]",

There are a few moments where Ormond really seems to come alive (like her laughing in the car after David picks her up), but on the whole it is merely a good performance. One sees a glimmer of hope in Ford's first few scenes. Then, he turns into Pinocchio for the rest of the movie.\nOverall, I would have loved the 15 minute difference between versions given to Wilder's for more interaction between Sabrina and Linus, one area where I felt Pollack's may have made a stronger case (slightly), notably in the part set on Martha's Vineyard.",

William Holden seemed like a man woman would throw themselves at (and they did!).\n\nSecondly: \nWhen Sabrina comes back from Paris she has David completely in love her with through her amazing beauty and style. But Julia Ormond, whilst very attractive, just isn't quite beautiful enough to really grab a guy like David who supposedly has beautiful women all over the place. Audrey Hepburn was someone who would grab his attention.\n\nThirdly:\nBogart's Linus tried to woo Sabrina by showing his lighter side, his more human side and Bogart played the role as a very light comedic one (even if he was clearly too old for the part). Ford's Linus tries to woo Sabrina by showing her his depressed and dull side. He has no energy about him and having Sabrina around doesn't seem to have had a positive effect on him.\n\nThere's also a montage which feels awkward, and whilst the 1954 version was a light romantic comedy, this one feels too melodramatic to me.\n\nCan you tell I'm a bit of a fan of the 1954 version?",

            "content": "(from The Watermark 12/17/95)\r\n\tSABRINA (Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, Greg Kinnear): In this emotionally muddy romantic comedy, a young chauffeurs daughter named Sabrina (Ormond) is madly in love with her boss handsome son (Kinnear). Trouble is, hes a lazy playboy, and doesnt even know she exists. When she leaves to spend a year in Paris, Kinnear becomes engaged. As it so happens, his fiancees parents own a large corporation - which Kinnears ultra-repressed businessman brother (Ford) wants to purchase. When the newly blossomed Sabrina returns - now stunningly beautiful, Kinnear takes one look at her and wants to call off the wedding. Ford doesnt want his deal to fail, so he tries to keep Sabrina away from Kinnear - by pretending to woo her himself. You guessed it - Sabrina helps Ford loosen up a bit, and see that his obsession with his work has made his life fruitful, but mostly empty. Ford ends up falling for Sabrina, and hopes she doesnt just have eyes for his brother.\r\n\tSydney Pollacks technical direction is marvelous: the cinematography is breathtaking, the soundtrack is lovely, and his use of montage is wonderful. Where he seems to have failed is in clarifying the emotional thrust of the characters, and compensating for the shortcomings of the screenplay. Ormond is lovely as the ugly-duckling-turned-swan Sabrina; her coming of age in France is a skillfully executed section of the film. It is never clear, though, why she is still so submissive upon her return. Another problem with her character is that were never sure that she doesnt still love Kinnear when she ends up with Ford.\r\n\tFord is a whole other problem: aside from being too old, he is a poor choice in casting to pull off the duality of a man who, in trying to coordinate a business deal, accidentally falls in love. In trying to convince himself its not happening, he tries to send Sabrina away, but the wooden Ford comes off as unlikeable instead of emotionally torn when he does so. Kinnear is a delight as the irresponsible brother - light, shallow, and perfectly suited to his demeanor and acting style. \r\nQUEER QUOTIENT: As a remake of Billy Wilders 1954 film of the same name which starred Audrey Hepburn, Sabrinas writers forgot to represent gays in modernizing the story. Like there arent any rich fags who give lavish parties in New York? Or queens in the fashion industry in Paris?",

Not because of Harrison Ford, who is actually just as good if not better than Bogey, nor Greg Kinear, who is indeed charming, but because of Julia Ormond. It's not that she isn't stunning-- she is, despite her ridiculous hair cut-- it's that she can't hold a candle to Audrey. Ormond just fails to capture the mirthful energy and whimsical nature that Hepburn inherently possesses; and, unfortunately, any attempt is to do so is an exercise in futility.",

Julia Ormond was so adorable but she just cannot compare to Audrey Hepburn as the original Sabrina; however, if anybody was going to come close, it was her.  Greg Kinnear was hilarious and the way that he played his character is what made this story work.  I do like the ending of this better than the original.  If I was going to suggest a movie to someone, I'd definitely recommend the original, but after you've experienced the original you'll definitely enjoy this one, as well.",
