I didn't see any story-telling value in making the wife Italian. 2. I realize people may quickly become infatuated with each other, but for the nomad photographer to invite this married Iowa farmwife to spend the rest of their lives - based on a couple of days - together was intellectually insulting. 3. On a small but irritating point, no man in 1965 was wearing his hair coiffed like Eastwood. 4. Most enjoyable for me was seeing the period-correct vehicles. A must-pass.",

If your in the mood for a somewhat philosophical/mildly thought provoking weepy type sentimental watch then this is a good choice to go for.\n\nI remember hearing about it when I was much younger, in my teenage years I think and I was told not much happens in it and that its pretty boring. I can understand why some people would say so - in one sense I suppose not a great deal does happen but I like it in terms of the depiction of companionship, the way the two main characters naturally grow closer during the few days they have together. There are some nice pieces of dialogue and I did feel quite emotionally connected to Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streeps character). I thought it had a somewhat similar feel and pace to it as the recent film version of Our Souls At Night, which stars Robert Redford.\n\nThis film certainly won't appeal to all but I liked it as a bit of an easy and comforting watch and it'd take a strong person not to feel at least a little emotional at times, so I'd say its an effective film. Overall, yes, I would recommend this film.",

            "content": "My 2022 quest to see all films starring Meryl Streep continues.\n\nThe Bridges of Madison County is a lovely romantic drama that gently unveils the four-day relationship between a lonely Iowa housewife and a world traveling photographer that occurred in 1965.\n\nThe film opens in \"the present\" as siblings Michael and Carolyn Johnson arrive at their childhood farmhouse to settle the estate of their mother, Francesca (Streep).  They are puzzled when it is revealed that their mother has requested to be cremated and that her ashes be scattered at the nearby Roseman Bridge, rather than being buried next to her husband.  As the two begin going through their mother's belongings, they discover that she once had a very brief yet intensely meaningful affair with professional photographer Robert Kinkaid (Clint Eastwood).   As they begin reading the journals in which Francesca detailed her time with Kinkaid, the two children come to understand their mother in a more mature way as they also question the trajectories of their own lives and marriages.\n\nFrancesca is an Italian war-bride whose marriage was, at least partially, a means to relocate to the United States.  As the story unfolds it becomes obvious that small farm life in Iowa was not what her dream had been, but it was now her reality.  When her husband and two children head off to the State Fair, Francesca elects to stay home in order to have four days to herself.  Fate intervenes when photographer Kinkaid arrives in her driveway to ask her for directions.   He's visiting Madison County to photograph its covered bridges for National Geographic magazine.  Francesca offers to ride with him to help him find Roseman Bridge and the two strike up a conversation that leads to dinner as the two discover their mutual admiration for each other.  Neither has any intention of advancing things beyond friendship and discussion.\n\nStreep gives a reserved and authentic performance accompanied with her Italian-Americanized accent.  This role garnered Streep with one of the twenty-one acting Oscar nominations she has received.  She unveils the mundane despair that Francesca endures with a magnificent deftness.  Francesca's history is fully established through Streep's facial expressions and physicality.   Eastwood, who is the film's director, is sublime as the earnest and passionate Kinkaid, a character keen from his observations of life and the bigger world.  It's a wonderful departure from the gruff and angry characters he typically plays.  \n\nMy one complaint with the film is that the actors playing Francesca's adult children in the \"current day\" scenes are quite dreadful.  In fact, the first 15 minutes of the film set in current day is like watching a poorly directed and poorly acted junior high school production.  The staging is bizarre, and the dialogue is utterly contrived.  Then switch to the past and Streep and Eastwood somehow convert that junior high feel into a Broadway production.  The transitions are jarring because of the drastic contrast in acting skills between the two time-periods.  Thankfully, Streep and Eastman prevail\u2026 as does the film.  It's a touching tale, and one well worth experiencing.",

The crisp and the uneasiness is bred, without any flirty talks and the way it surfs around the edgy with a shady note, is stupendously breathtaking. The attraction depicted in here plays a vital role and the makers being aware of the strength of the cast, milks it out from them that lures the viewers in, in its innocent bubble. The background score is mesmerizing, the cinematography is pure magic with fine editing and well detailed camera work. \n\nContrary to premise where it suggests it has a limited span to be spent upon, the feature is maturely calm and soothing where eschewing their characters appropriately, the actors cast in their spells in a subtle tone. The narration is adaptive, elaborative and exquisite with gripping screenplay and pragmatic conversations. \n\nSculpted to communicate for subsequent generation, the tale speaks volume metaphorically in those calm silent pitches that is harrowing and heartwarming at the same time. Streep is a revelation in her convoluted and unsure portrayal that is probably one of her best and underrated performance and on the other hand Eastwood is poised and reserved, supporting her thoroughly in each aspect.\n\nLaGravanese's exquisite adaptation gets better execution than anticipated from Eastwood's deck and is probably his finest act. The poem that flows fluently across the entire feature, a stunningly beautiful tale and stellar performances at the heart of it are the high points of the feature. \n\nThe Bridges Of Madison County is a rare art where its poignancy is naturally cathartic for its innocence foliated through chivalrous allegory.",

This is one amongst the finest Eastwood performances, though the same cannot the said about the film. The film is lumbering, lethargic and the romance is at times so tedious that I felt it can only satsify the most ardent romantics. Meryl Streep also gives a good performance, in fact this is one of the very few starring roles of the actress that I've seen. To my surprise the film was really satisfying in the end with potent sentimentality, not maipulative melodrama.",

            "content": "What makes \"The Bridges of Madison County\" so romantic is its pulsating desire, slow like honey and sultry summertime heat.  Famously, the film is considered to be better than its source material - whereas Robert James Waller's novel of the same name is said to contain passages schmaltzier than your favorite Hallmark channel TV-movie, Clint Eastwood's 1995 adaptation converts syrup into lush longing.  It is about two people who find a love rare and certain but choose not to go through with a relationship due to responsibility and circumstance; we feel their burning for one another ripple throughout our bodies, affecting us at every turn.  Most romantic melodramas choose to go the happy ending/tragedy route; \"The Bridges of Madison County\" is such a successful foray into a genre because it places painful reality into a sublime mixture of cinematic tenderness.  \n\tMost are still familiar with the story twenty years after its introduction: it frames the four-day love affair between Italian housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep, who completely disappears into the role) and National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), who accidentally fall into each other's lives after Robert innocently stops at Francesca's house for directions to the nearby Bridges of Madison County.  What begins as an exchange of manners turns into something more after she decides to follow him along on his photography excursion instead of politely moving on.\n\tFour days is a short time for anyone to fall head over heels in love, but Francesca and Robert have an uncommon connection - it only takes a few late night talks for them to discover that they were made for each other.  But, alas, she is happily married, with two teenage kids; her husband, a working man, is kind to her, fond of her company.  Her children need her more than ever.  But for Francesca, who moved from Italy to Iowa because of the union, there is something left to be desired - and Robert fulfills everything her spouse cannot.  He is considerate of her emotions, aware of her hidden talents.  He sees her as a remarkable woman rather than a dutiful housewife.  The climactic sight of her clutching her husband's truck door, contemplating whether to jump out and run after Robert, is devastating - to stay is painful, but to leave would be a tidal wave of brutal catharsis.  \n\tThe entire romance is told through flashback - as \"The Bridges of Madison County\" opens, the children of the now deceased Francesca are brought to her Iowan home to look over her will, discovering the affair after finding a trio of journals that chronicles those meaningful four days.  This narrative device would be manipulative anywhere else, but in Eastwood's no-nonsense hands, it makes the story all the more poignant.  Now adults with marital troubles of their own, Francesca's children are old enough to understand just how sacred romance is - and how much of a generous tragedy it was for their mother to give up the passion of a lifetime for them.\n\tWith Eastwood at the helm, \"The Bridges of Madison County\" teeters on the sappy, but, for the most part, remains a plausible tale of love for the ages.  His use of a minimal soundtrack evokes the atmospheric, dripping nature of the erotic tension that vibrates between Robert and Francesca; his pauses to study the silent emotions of the leading characters gives us a chance to become them, to potentially see life through their eyes.  Richard LaGravenese's script is considerate, thoughtful; he gives the central figures room to breathe, to consider every possible outcome.  Waller's maudlin prose (not read by me) is completely washed away.  LaGravenese's linguistic maneuvers are incredibly deliberate.\n\tBut while \"The Bridges of Madison County\" is a distinguished romance film, there is something too faraway, too dreamy for it to be anything besides a weepy tale of splendor in the grass.  It feels so personal that it doesn't have much meaning for anyone other than Robert, Francesca, or Francesca's children.  It doesn't seem real, rather sweepingly cinematic.  It's a tragic fantasy.  But it is prosperous when it comes to presenting us with genuine emotion, and Streep's performance is uniformly excellent.  Perhaps I didn't attach to it as much as I would like to because I'm not the intended audience - but that hardly matters.  Here is a romance so refreshingly honest one hardly has time to consider its bathos.",
