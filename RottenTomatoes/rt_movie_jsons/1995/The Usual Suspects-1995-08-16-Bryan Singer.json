Kint attempts to convince the feds that the mythic crime lord not only exists, but is also responsible for drawing Kint and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro Harbor - leaving few survivors.",

It features surprises, action, and suspense that stays under-played rather than over-developed. I wouldn't let anyone ruin the ending for you, so be careful who you ask about this movie. It isn't the best thing in the universe, but if you don't know how it ends, it's fun. When I was younger this was my favorite movie of all time. It has aged pretty well, and the acting is outstanding from everyone involved in the project. The surprises are throughout the movie, making it fun to watch. Del Toro's performance especially, the scene where he pisses on the fire, and the ending make this a must-see.",

Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.\n\n'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.\n\nFilm is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.\n\nIt has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.\n\nOverall, magnificent film in every sense. Recommended with no hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Without giving away too much for the uninitiated, the action all centers around the existence (or myth) of the mysterious Keyser Soze, who one character summarizes by saying \u2018I believe in God and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.'  The plot is labyrinthine but not impossible to follow, the cast is excellent, much of the dialogue is highly quotable, and the twist in the final scene is remarkable.  Unlike so many movies with twist endings, The Usual Suspects may actually be more engaging with additional viewings once you're aware of the story behind the Soze mystery.",

            "content": "1995 knew many hits, not all expected, and The Usual Suspects was one of them. This movie was directed by Bryan Singer before he blew the minds of many comic book fans with a couple amazing X-Men-movies. Starring an impressive cast consisting of Benicio Del Toro, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey and Stephen Baldwin, this movie had a lot going for it. It made some pretty big waves after its release and is now old enough to be considered a classic.\n\nA massive gunfight results in a veritable bloodbath and fire in the Los Angeles Harbor, causing an incredible loss of life. Verbal Kint, a professional con-man and full-time cripple, seems to be one of the only survivors of this disaster. He is apprehended and tells the story of the events leading up this debacle. Here, he eventually pins the blame on Keyser S\u00f6ze, a psychopathic and rutless kingpin, believed to be more of a mythical boogieman than an actual person.\n\nWhat makes this movie stand out- at least for me- is the entire mystery surrounding the character of Keyser S\u00f6ze. He is as imposing and threating, as he ethereal. This character throws a long shadow over the story that looms just beyond the limits of the screen. This makes the entertaining characters and heists they're pulling of even more interesting, as they are slowly being pulled into a maelstrom that could mean the end of them. Each role is masterfully played, as both Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne truly shine in their respective personas. \nWhile the movie has aged well in a narrative sense, its wrinkles are showing in its more simplistic sense of cinematography. Conversations are simple back-and-forths, establishing shots are pans. 'Suspects' could have used a bit more of a dynamic style to fit the ever-moving pace of the story.\nIt has some slower beats, that are mostly necessary for the pacing anyhow. \n\nI had a good time with this movie, and anyone that hasn't seen it can get my recommendation for it. Despite its age, I refuse to give away any spoilers, as its ending is iconic to say the least. \n'The Usual Suspects' receives an 8.5/10.",
