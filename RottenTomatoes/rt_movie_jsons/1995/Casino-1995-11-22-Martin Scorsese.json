    "summary": "In early-1970s Las Vegas, low-level mobster Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) gets tapped by his bosses to head the Tangiers Casino. At first, he's a great success in the job, but over the years, problems with his loose-cannon enforcer Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), his ex-hustler wife Ginger (Sharon Stone), her con-artist ex Lester Diamond (James Woods) and a handful of corrupt politicians put Sam in ever-increasing danger. Martin Scorsese directs this adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's book.",

It's not as intriguing as Goodfellas was when I was rooting against the lead characters, and not as interesting and complex as the storyline of The Godfather. Even in comparison with the over-the-top Scarface, it lacks real value and true substance. Some scenes with Joe Pesci are memorable, but the rest of the movie seems like a waste of space. Scorsese's career revolved around mobster movies, and this was just too slow of a movie. The problem with mobster movies is that they are fantasy and yet ring in oodles of money because of the dumb average American who watches them and believes them to be true.",

A few scenes like the desert conversation between Nicky and Sam are gold, but the narrative is too familiar. The second half of the movie also disappoints, with less focus on the casino and the gangs, instead becoming a family drama and not a very good one at that. Still, an incredible feat of movie-making from Scorsese",

            "content": "\"Casino\" gives a gripping and fascinating inside view of the World's gambling mecca during the 1970's and early 1980's. The film is based on Nicholas Pilegg's true accounts of two childhood friends who end up running a casino and various businesses on behalf of the local mob \"back home.\" Las Vegas at this period in time wasn't about fun and glamour but greed and money. One difference that makes \"Casino\" stand out from other mob movies is the sense of \u00a0history of Vegas that Scorsese brings into the narrative. The city itself is as much a subject in \"Casino\" as the characters and plot. Las Vegas, due to its sheer profit and power had always let entrepreneurs, mobsters and even corporations flourish. However, relatively quickly Vegas destroyed them for its own financing and status before allowing others to come in and take their place.\u00a0\n\nRobert De Nero and Joe Pesci play the two friends, Ace and Nicky, who end up running their mob operation in Las Vegas. Throughout the movie both actors also add narration to some of the flashback scenes to give context which works to great effect. Sharon Stone is excellent as Ace's wife Ginger, an expert hustler who can't shake off her dark past including her former pimp Lester Diamond ( James Woods ). The story of \"Casino\" is told with Scorsese's usual meticulous eye for detail, high energy and pacing and he really gets the best once again from his two go to main actors. There are many regular Scorsese support actors and a host of cameos including Frankie Avalon, Steve Allen and future mayor of Las Vegas Oscar Goodman.\u00a0\n\nDespite the lengthy running time \"Casino\" is so fast paced that the time goes quickly. It's escalating tension and compelling story keeps engagement right until its rather sad concluding statement \" The big corporations took over, Today, it works like \"Disneyland\"",

            "content": "The great Martin Scorsese turns his cinematic eye from the 'Mean Streets' and 'Goodfellas' of New York, to the Midwest mob's takeover of Las Vegas in this gangster film, another feather in his cap of classic gritty crime dramas. He once again teams up with his muse Robert De Niro and runner-up muse Joe Pesci. While it may seem as though they're simply re-inhabiting their 'Goodfellas' roles, the characters and performances here are different enough to worth noticing. De Niro's Sam Rothstein is something of a fussbudget, a sports handicapper who mingles with the mafia and helps them make a lot of money in gambling. He's detailed, precise, and knows the in-and-outs of winning money. So, naturally, they set him up  to run the Tangiers Casino. Pesci is Nicky, the enforcer sent to oversee and protect Sam and the casino operation. This isn't the gung-ho street cowboy from his Oscar-winning turn in 'Goodfellas.' His Nicky is a bit more subdued, if barely. He's an ambitious and greedy man, masking his violent tendencies under the guise of a big boss and family man. The most emotive role goes to Sharon Stone, and she plays the hell out of it. As Rothstein's wife, she plays a woman who knows how to charm and seduce the rich and powerful, but is underneath it all a broken girl and lifelong survivor who longs to just simply be cared for, and after a while only finds solace in pills and booze. Scorsese ably populates the supporting cast with faces that feel Vegas lived-in: James Woods is a manipulative pimp, Kevin Pollack is the clean-cut front man, Alan King is a connected Vegas insider, and the great Don Rickles just LOOKS like someone who been in Vegas a lifetime, even if he isn't here to score laughs. There's familiar voice-over, although it adds insight to the characters motivations, and there's more melodrama than one may expect from this genre. But the production values are first-rate, with cinematography, costume, set design, editing, and music brilliantly capturing the lurid seductiveness of this glitzy oasis in the middle of the desert. At three hours long, it's a hefty drama but Scorsese and his cast keep us fascinated and deliver a rather brisk movie, all things considered. It may not quite rank with his classics in the genre, but Scorsese knows how to fuse a gangster film with heft, gravitas, and even entertainment value",

It's a frenetic roller coaster ride of a movie, filled with sudden and brutal violence, plenty of uncomfortable laughs, and even a romance angle.

The tale is operatic in its scope and ambition, effectively taking some of the stylistic and thematic elements of \"Goodfellas\" and expanding it to national proportions. This adds a kind of seedy grandeur to the criminal element previously depicted in Scorsese's preceding gangster epic, yet we find ourselves realizing that the smaller and more intimate scope of \"Goodfellas\" was part and parcel of its attractiveness to our nostalgic sensibilities. Along similar lines, \"Casino's\" near-documentary methods regarding the detailed explanation of the voluminous minutiae inherent in the framework of casino life wins over our heads while leaving our hearts a little cold. \"Casino\" is thus a resounding success as an informative and well enacted depiction of mafia-controlled Las Vegas, only coming up short through comparisons with its flawless predecessor.",

            "content": "In 1968, sports handicapper and Mafia associate Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is sent by the Chicago Mafia to Las Vegas to run the Tangiers Casino. Front man Philip Green serves as the casino and hotel CEO, but Sam unofficially runs everything. Sam quickly doubles the casino's profits, with cash skimmed directly from the count room and delivered to the Midwest Mafia bosses. Chicago boss Remo Gaggi sends Sam's childhood friend and mob enforcer Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) to protect Sam and the casino. Nicky makes sure everyone is kept in line, but his own criminal activities start drawing too much media and law enforcement attention. He recruits his younger brother Dominick and childhood friend Frankie Marino to gather a crew that specializes in shakedowns, burglaries and jewelry heists. Nicky is eventually placed in the Nevada Black Book, banning him from every casino in Nevada. Sam meets and falls in love with beautiful hustler and former prostitute Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). In 1969 they have a daughter, Amy, and marry, but their marriage is quickly thrown into turmoil due to Ginger's relationship with her longtime boyfriend, con artist Lester Diamond. Sam has Nicky's crew beat Lester when they catch him accepting $25,000 from her. In the mid-1970s, Ginger's problems intensify as she turns to drugs and alcohol. In 1976, Sam fires slot manager Don Ward for incompetence. When Ward's brother-in-law, Clark County Commission chairman Pat Webb, fails to convince Sam to rehire Don, Webb arranges for Sam's gaming license to be denied, jeopardizing his position. Sam starts hosting a local television talk show from inside the casino, irritating both Nicky and the bosses back home for making himself such a public figure and bringing unneeded attention. Sam blames Nicky's recklessness for ongoing police and Nevada Gaming Board pressure, and the two argue furiously in the Mojave Desert. When the Midwest bosses discover that people on the inside are stealing from their skim, they install incompetent Kansas City underboss Artie Piscano to oversee the operation. Piscano ends up keeping detailed written records of the operation. Additionally, an FBI bug placed in Piscano's store for a separate crime catches him talking in detail about the skim, prompting a full investigation into the Tangiers Casino...\n\nUpon its release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics, although their praise was more muted than it had been for the thematically similar Goodfellas, released only five years earlier, with some reviewers criticizing Scorsese for retreading familiar territory. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Impressive ambition and bravura performances from an outstanding cast help Casino pay off in spite of a familiar narrative that may strike some viewers as a safe bet for director Martin Scorsese.\" Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four, stating that \"Martin Scorsese's fascinating new film Casino knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas. Like The Godfather it makes us feel like eavesdroppers in a secret place.\" He added, \"Unlike his other Mafia movies (Mean Streets and Goodfellas), Scorsese's Casino is as concerned with history as with plot and character.\" Philip Thomas of the Empire praised the film while highlighting its similarities to Goodfellas. He gave the film five stars commenting \"It may not be Scorsese's greatest work, but this guy feeling a little off-colour is still far, far better than most people on fighting-fit form. It only gets more impressive as time goes on.\" The film's critical profile has increased in years after its release, with several critics expressing that, in retrospect, they feel it is a more accomplished and artistically mature work than the thematically similar Goodfellas. (via Wikipedia)\n\nAs mentioned in the critical response \"Casino\" is a bit too similar to \"Goodfellas\", however this one feels even longer than the latter and it\u00b4s too slow and too talkative to me. We get a great cast by far, but that\u00b4s not enough as the storyline is not that intriguing and it just goes on and on. And I would argue that Pesci\u00b4s role, Nicky Santoro, is way too similar to his role in \"Goodfellas\". And to be honest, I dont\u00b4think this is amongst Stone's top performances despite the fact that she got a Golden Globe Award for her role as Ginger McKenna. I would argue that \"Goodfellas\" is a better film than \"Casino\". \n\nTriva: \"Casino\" was released in 1995 to a mostly positive critical reception, and was a worldwide box office success. Stone's performance was singled out for acclaim, earning her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.",

What should also be noted and deserve praise is the flashy costume designs for this film along with the pretty good songs featured in the film that fit the classic and iconic Las Vegas theme.

It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.\n\nCasino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.\n\nThe story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.\n\nOverall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I loved seeing De Niro star in a serious, prestigious movie (I've not seen Raging Bull as of this writing and thought his Godfather Pt 2 turn was a little overrated) but he ended up helming a movie that I can't help but compare unfavorably to its fairly legendary peers.

            "content": "A couple of wise guys take charge of a casino for back home.\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese's epic crime drama Casino (1995) is like if Mean Streets or Goodfellas largely took place in Las Vegas. It's very refined and slick in how Scorsese directs Casino with a fast pace and a surprising amount of black comedy. Scorsese regales you with his sleek recreation of 1970's and 1980's Las Vegas and the story of how a Jewish mobster takes over the Tangiers luxury casino and hotel on behalf of the Italian mafia in order to launder money through a legit business back home to the elder mob bosses. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci's narration is pithy and absorbing as they take you through the ins and outs of casino dealings and day to day practices of the time. It's quite clever of Scorsese to have these two charismatic actors lend their voices and personality to this hilarious and fierce narration.\n\nWriters Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi are brilliant with smart storytelling that lets you in on the violent payback and sleazy lifestyles of the rich and influential. I believe every word of this story and how deftly each casino security measure and mob conversation plays out is completely realistic here in Casino. I did not fully understand Casino when I first saw it as a young man, but now it's like a spiritual successor to Mean Streets and Goodfellas in every sense.\n\nRobert De Niro is excellent as the calm and measured casino boss Sam \u2018Ace' Rothstein. His increasing frustrations and rage show an inner foolishness that never lets his ego stop him from preventing his own downfall. Sharon Stone is simply lovely and entertaining as Ace's cocaine addicted escort-wife Ginger McKenna. Her screams of defiance are shocking and hilarious in a breathtaking performance. She's totally believable as this strung out, greedy, grifter. \n\nJoe Pesci is a riot to watch scream and murder to his heart's content as the hothead made man Nicky Santoro. Casino is yet another example of Pesci acting just as well as Robert De Niro in this fiery and fearsome performance as the ruthless and unflinching Nicky. The sheer audacity of Ace and Nicky shows how their lives were over with their first mistake of coming to Las Vegas and trying to rule over the mafia bosses there. De Niro, Stone, and Pesci are formidable leads.\n\nJames Woods is perfectly cast as a sleazy pimp named Lester Diamond, clearly only out for himself. Don Rickles is fun as the casino manager Billy Sherbert with his loyalty to Ace. Alan King is interesting as the constantly concerned middle man Andy Stone. Kevin Pollak is very funny as the front man politician Phillip Green. Pasquale Cajano is wonderful as the soft voiced elder mafia lord Remo Gaggi. Frank Vincent is great as Pesci's henchman Frank Marino with his seething anger and two-faced conversations. \n\nCatherine Scorsese's cameo is really adorable and funny at the deli owner Piscano's mother. Vinny Vella is so good as the incessantly complaining Artie Piscano. Nobu Matsuhisa Erika von Tagen Nick Mazzola David Rose John Bloom Joseph Rigano Philip Suriano Melissa Prophet Bill Allison Joe La Due Joseph P. Reidy Craig Vincent Carl Ciarfalio Gene Ruffini Dominick Grieco Clem Caserta Daniel P. Conte Joey DePinto Jack Orend Paul Herman Jed Mills Claudia Haro Ffolliott Le Coque John Manca Ronald Maccone Joseph Bono Frank Adonis Anthony Russell Stuart Nisbet Alfred Nittoli C.C. Carr Peter Conti Steve Vignari Frankie J. Allison Steve Schirripa Millicent Sheridan Frankie Avalon Safi El Masri\n\nThelma Schoonmaker's editing is so sharply cut around all these tough guy antics and FBI observations that 179 minutes passes by and Casino doesn't even feel half that length. Scorsese is the only director that makes epics feel like you're on an adventure into the lifestyles of the rich and infamous. Robert Richardson's cinematography not only looks incredible with ultra wide shots of the desert where wiseguys get whacked and buried in the sand, but stylish with all these creative shots around the casino floor.\n\nProduction designer Dante Ferretti recreates an older era of casinos with lavish style and immaculate detail. You never question the year. Jack G. Taylor Jr. helps with keeping the time period realistic with his lovely art direction and flourish. Rick Simpson and Daniel Ross' set decoration looks like the 70's and 80's with all the loud colors and tacky furniture. \n\nI liked the grounded, yet explosive visual effects from Craig Barron for the car bomb to various gunshots and other killings. Composer Roy Hawkins writes a fine score for Casino with plenty of playful cues. I love Scorsese's old school soundtrack full of The Animals and The Rolling Stones alongside other Scorsese favorites. Rita Ryack's costuming is so flamboyant and stunning with goofy pastel suits for Robert De Niro and extravagant dresses for the ever sultry Sharon Stone. Tricia Sawyer's make-up makes Stone glow and all the guys sweat with a raw look to Casino.\n\nIn short, Casino is a burst of energy from Scorsese clearly having fun with his favorite actors telling an outrageous and killer crime narrative like only Scorsese could tell.",

After shunning the channel a couple of weeks ago in my take down of some truly rotten movies, I aimed a dig at Dave for never to my knowledge showing a great film. Well that ends tonight as everyone sits down and enjoys one of my favourite Scorsese films. For me, Casino is up there with his best (The King Of Comedy [1982], Goodfellas [1990]) pulling superb performances from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (as usual) and especially Sharon Stone who is sensational. Casino was one of the first Scorsese films I ever saw, which is probably why I hold it in such high regard, but the way in which it interweaves the story of violence and betrayal around the inner workings of a Casino and the Las Vegas scene is fascinating. It's also an excellent example of what Paul Verhoeven was aiming for when he made Showgirls (1995), and, sure, he fell way short of this, but Casino at least gives you a blueprint of an idea of what Showgirls should have been, and I still defend it.",

An epic about streetwise, determined, greedy, self-obsessed, and fundamentally distrustful individuals, the flaws that expose them, and the city of grift and greased palms that attracts such personalities. Characters will uniformly smile at your face before pulling a knife a few seconds later. The film is a master class in worldbuilding and character development, creating a consistent sense of engagement despite the focus on voiceovers, which there seems to somehow be a frequent perception as a cheap trick in serious drama, more of a Guy Ritchie movie (still Pesci seems like he's more reading off a script if the camera's not on him, more often than not). DeNiro brings his usual degree of capability, but I can't say his performance is really exceptional in his distinguished career; it's Stone's sincerity and Pesci's raw ferocity (coupled with a few eminently quaotable and eloquent outbursts) that steal the show. The soundtrack is well-selected but weaved in with a degree of subtlety. Scorsese's direction is as on-point as I've ever seen, and is to me the best of his crime filmography (yes, even better than Goodfellas), and is only really topped in the director's output by Raging Bull, with Taxi Driver and Gangs of New York in close company. (5/5)",

Casino, in short, is the story of Las Vegas becoming what we know it as today.\n\nThe based-on-a-true-story format works well here. The action is believable and the times-of-the-era feel is well done. It was funny that when I went to Vegas all I could think about was how it felt like I was in this film instead of the other way around. That's some good storytelling.\n\n5/5.

The characters are so realistic you could have a full conversation with every one them.  I like how every character has something wrong with them just like people in real life.  This is one of Robert De Niro's best performances of all time.  The plot was amazing with its pacing and progression.  I loved how the beginning hooks your attention with the man's car being blown up.  I also like how the narrator doesn't say in the beginning \"Now you're probably wondering how I got into this mess...\". It shows that some things are better shown than said.  The ending was extremely realistic and ultimately satisfying.  I really can't say much more, but if you're a fan of Vegas flicks, this is a must watch.",

Considering especially in comparison to how alot of movies are like in quality these days (2019 and so on) this film to me is truly an excellent one. Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci were fucking amazing in this film and Sharon Stone is a bomb and fire quality actress in this film. I hated her guts in this film.

            "content": "This is Goodfellas (1990) but even more so as we get screeds of voiceover, excessive violence, materialism and over-the-top characters stuffed into a nearly three hour film that is almost too gratifying. Although it doesn't reach the heights of Goodfellas the film still boasts it's own draws with the performances of Robert De Niro and Sharon Stone, the entertaining script and the marvelous visuals. Having more Goodfellas-style films couldn't be a bad thing when they are produced by the same team and are just as funny and oddly fascinating as that masterpiece.\n\nRobert De Niro stars as Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, a Jewish handicapper who is affiliated with the Mafia is hired to work at the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas where he achieves immense success. Before long Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci, has followed him and he becomes a successful enforcer at the casino. The real problem starts when Rothstein falls in love, or lust, with Ginger McKenna, Sharon Stone, a shallow, entitled former prostitute who lives for money and material objects but is emotionally dependent on con-artist Lester Diamond, James Woods. When Rothstein makes some poor hiring and firing decisions he begins to alienate higher-ups in the Mafia and in the Las Vegas area, leading to disaster.\n\nWe understand immediately what type of film this is going to be from the first shot of De Niro's being torn apart as it floats in the sky whilst flames rage around it, apparently representing hell. When voiceover narration from Pesci and De Niro kicks in you feel even more assured in knowing what type of film you are getting yourself into and it doesn't disappoint. I was never bored for nearly three hours and as the film swung from crime drama to family drama everything still felt exciting and connected in a way that only Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi seem to able to create. They take real stories that sound absolutely fake and they turn them into films that are at once ridiculously excessive but also engrossing period pieces and jigsaw puzzle Mafia films that are immensely satisfying when all is said and done.\n\nOne of the things that makes Casino so riveting is the inclusion of small very specific details that are both funny and informative about the character. It's no surprise that my Father remarked upon hearing Rothstein complain about his blueberry muffin and then go do something about it that he was \"fair\", this is a detail that explains that Rothstein likes to be in control of everything but also that his motivations can seem reasonable. When McKenna tells her baby \"Look, Daddy bought me all this jewelry because he loves me\" and later snorts cocaine in front of her we know that she is a train wreck. These deviations from the central plot of the film are beguiling but they give you more fleshed out characters and enhance the effect of plot developments.\n\nStone gives her greatest performance in this film as the rotten to the core McKenna whose death due to a drug overdose seems inevitable when you trace her journey from a very young prostitute to a woman who couldn't want for more but does. Her dangerously dependent relationship with Diamond, James Woods really captures the essence of his character in the few scenes he appears in, is one of those strange features that appear in Scorsese films that does humanize her in some way. When we hear Woods' creepy voice as Diamond strings McKenna along even after her marriage and he describes seeing her \"For the first time at 14\" we understand why she relies on him so much and keeps returning to him again and again, he is the only parental figure she ever really had. Of course everyone else in the film is great but that goes without saying, I find it sad that Stone wasn't able to get more roles that showed her acting talent after this astonishing performance.\n\nI would definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed Goodfellas (1990) and adult audiences in general. It's a violent good time with an unusually brilliant screenplay and Sharon Stone's best performance as a drug-addicted materialist. That is why it is his ninth greatest production. What's not to love about the film that is essentially an extension of Scorsese's greatest triumph?",

And I think they both starred in Once Upon a Time in America and I've heard that it's a really long film. With Robert De Niro's last collaboration between Martin Scorsese, this film is based on true events of what happened in Las Vegas, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci played Sam Rothstein, aka \"Ace\" and Nicholas Santoro, aka \"Nicky\", They're both childhood friends in real-life. It's kind of an interesting story about those two friends are getting alot of heat on Las Vegas of who's going to run the Casino. I really like this movie even though it is very similar to GoodFellas with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci narrating but what can I say, there's nothing wrong with that and this is a phenomenal film with great performances and story and it has some good tunes in it.

Sharon Stone gives her best performance ever as Ginger Mckenna & Joe Pesci is entertaining as hell as Nicky Santoro! This may be an unpopular opinion but I enjoy Casino more than Goodfellas. Goodfellas maybe a better made film but this film in my opinion Casino has a bit more to offer. If intense violent scenes, VERY strong language, and a bloody finale doesn't bother you I most definitely recommend viewing Martin Scorsese's second collaboration with Nicholas Pileggi in Casino! An intreaging movie with a brilliant cast, gorgeous visuals, and great cinematography! CASINO IS A MUST SEE!",

It was shocking how similar it felt to Goodfellas, a movie 5 years earlier also from Scorsese. I didn\u2019t need a retread of that movie because it did nothing for me, but at least this one had a sympathetic protagonist. Centering everything around Robert De Niro\u2019s character was smart, because he was the one guy who seemed to be fighting not to fall into the criminal underworld. Watching his decline was difficult, but it made sense. Sharon Stone plays the obnoxious, spoiled wife better than I expected because she\u2019s not a very good actress otherwise. And Joe Pesci was the same old Joe Pesci you always get, hot-tempered and foul-mouthed. Speaking of foul-mouthed...I\u2019m just mystified that this passes for good writing. When you are so unimaginative and lazy with the script that every third word is an F-bomb, it gets tedious. I like smart, witty dialogue that grabs you and takes full advantage of the power of words. Casino sounds like a group of middle-schoolers who just discovered they could get away with swearing were responsible for the script. Language is such an amazing tool that can truly impress the audience, but this movie just beats the audience over the head with a baseball bat of profanity. The voiceover is tedious in Casino as well. It is necessary only a couple of times, and yet we get 3 different people delivering it. (I almost laughed aloud when the third guy started.) I do have to commend Casino for one thing. It pulled a bait-and-switch on me. The opening scenes upset me, and I was ready to get angry because it was utilizing a trope that drives me crazy in films. However, they turned things around later in the movie, and I was delighted that the film went that route. (I\u2019m trying to remain vague to avoid spoiling the plot.) While the subject matter holds little interest for me, and I get tired of the way Casino presented it, this isn\u2019t the worst gangster movie I\u2019ve seen. Thanks to a likable character leading the film, I was engaged almost the whole way through. The ending that surprised me was enough to make Casino a movie I didn\u2019t hate. I won\u2019t watch it again, but at least it was tolerable to watch the first time.",

A cash cow that ultimately ends up with the Mafia in Kansas City.\nIntertwined in the story is Sharon Stone as prostitute/substance misuser Ginger McKenna who marries Rothstein and whose gradual descent into marriage split/attempted kidnap of Rothstein's daughter is one strand of the collapse of the then successful casino operation.\nOther factors are the strict Las Vegas authorities that refuse at first Santaro and then Rofstein employment in the gambling industry.\nThe downfall of the operation forms the backdrop to the end of the film and some pretty gruesome deaths even by my standards of film viewing!\nScorsese delivers yet again. It may not quite live up to the standards of 1990s GoodFellas but certainly is still one of the best films of the decade.\nScorsese 'viewers' will be aware that his films are quite long in duration but many plot points would be missed if they were edited.\nStick with his films and don't lose your concentration is my advice.\nIf I found one criticism it was the Joe Percy character Santoro who almost replicated his GoodFellas role as a pretty nasty mobster whose attitude was he would rather kill you with three bullets to the skull rather than one.\nI'm glad I watched and my Scorsese tour continues albeit with a few coffees to keep me going!",

Joe Pesci is amazing in the role of a brutal and violent Mafia boss. Although his character is utterly terrifying, you can't take your eyes off him. Sharon Stone is also terrific though her role is only minor. At nearly three hours, \"Casino\" is a long film that drags towards the end.

The standout, though, is Sharon Stone as Ace's troublesome wife, Ginger, who can't be satisfied even when she scores the jackpot.  Behind the camera Scorcese crafts a nice crime epic that mostly tells how mob lost Las Vegas, but doesn't quite hit the point across.  Like the book by Nicolas Pileggi, it is by the numbers and only touches on how the mafia built & shaped Las Vegas, such has bringing in big name acts or modernizing sports betting.  He also doesn't point out how the mob losing Vegas was inevitable, as gambling & prostitution being legal made it impossible for them to operate against legitimate businesses & corporations, though he does point out that once mob violence started growing, it accelerated the process.  Scorcese once again doesn't sugar coat the mafia, showing them for the brutal thugs that they were (what happens to the principle characters is downright sickening), and despite it's oppressive length of 3 hours, remains mostly enjoyable throughout.   Overall, a good crime film but in no way a great one.",

Another thing that comes to mind is that it is extremely obvious that this film was directed by Martin Scorsese. This film hits all the trademarks like casting Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, having a bunch of Italian mob gangsters all talking in New York accents, violence, narration, a femme fatale, a broken marriage and a greedy, power-hungry protagonist whose pride is their downfall. Although, even if it seems like I have seen all this before, it's still really good. It's not like watching Adam Sandler trademarks over and over, it's watching a master at his craft create another great film. After watching, I definitely want to go to Vegas now. The way Vegas is shot makes it look like a paradise even with all it's violence, sex, drugs and scandal. Also, this might be my favourite Robert De Niro performance. Sure, I haven't seen Taxi Driver or Raging Bull yet, but for some reason this was my favourite performance of his. Joe Pesci on the otherhand is one of the best swearing actors. He has this bulldog demeaner to him that makes his vulgar language just a treat to listen to. Sharon Stone, seemed like she could have been played by any actress but she has good (or bad depending on how you look at it) chemistry with Robert De Niro.

Joe Pesci plays the same short tempered badass who will shed no tears or waste a minute on someone who he thinks is outta line, and beat them to a pulp.  De Niro is the same quiet and very kind, yet ruthless head of a small band of friends within a much larger operation.  It's a great story, and that is the highlight of the movie. It gives a good impression of the lives of real gangsters, and is a compelling and intense story throughout, and strays from being stuck just inside of the Casino which is its namesake.  The acting is of course top notch and impressive, which in the end makes the film, along with the story, script, and narrative.  The action is more of story and brutal killings or tortures, which are portrayed well, although when someone is shot it is a bit lacking of bullet effects, unlike the other movies mention all above.

DeNiro is great. Pesci is great. Don Rickles is great. James Wood is great. Sharon Stone is good. she is my biggest flaw with the movie. her character is the most annoying and irritating character I have ever seen.

Casino is essentially Goodfellas with a Las Vegas twist, which is quite odd coming from a director as diverse as Scorsese. Casino may have the same admirable technical qualities to be expected from someone like Scorsese, such as smooth cinematography and fitting production and costume design, but it's not even close to matching the same narrative gravitas of Goodfellas. It's the same rise-and-fall plot featuring characters that feel too similar to those in Goodfellas: Joe Pesci's characters in this and Goodfellas are nearly indistinguishable. Casino gets a bit of a pass for being adapted from true events, but still feels all too familiar. The film also runs far too long: many plot points in the nearly three hour runtime feel expendable and seem to drag. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it's disappointing to see someone like Scorsese ultimately make the same movie twice.",

Between his manic camera whips, classic juke box jams and fervent narrative it's impossible not to be wrapped up in some of his movies. He's an amazing visual showman. While may not be even in the top 10 Scorsese movies (his work is so prolific that it's a complex list), it would still be one of the best movies in any year of release.\nThe operatic melodrama about the rise and fall of 1970's Casino wiseguy Ace Rothstein is eerily similar to the directors best known film Goodfellas. It a dark, complex, nostalgic tale staring Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci again. There's the same style of omniscient narrative that  front-loads thorough details of a criminal operation, which he did once again in The Wolf of Wall Street, and with humor he glamorizes the criminal world, while never fully condemning their pursuit of happiness in a corrupt society. The unique factor here is Sharon Stone. In quite possibly the best performance of her career, she is a standout. While De Niro calmly moves through the underworld like a patient shark, and Pesci uses brutal violence (and a pen, and a vice) to express his swift anger, Stone, as Ginger, is luridly fashionable and dangerous as a former prostitute, drug addict who manipulates every man she talks to except her former pimp. While Rothstein never bets on the wrong horse, he knowingly makes a big risk by marrying and trusting Ginger.\nThe performances are of course great and filled out by solid acting from Don Rickles & James Woods. The story told here is the most impressive. While many consider Las Vegas to be Disneyland today, there was a time when it was overwhelmingly run by the midwest Mafia. Everyone worked for somebody and it was, and likely still is, the most legal criminal operation in the United States. Money lines the pockets of all those who look the other way, while every year millions of Americans are willingly robbed blind as a means of entertainment But damn if it isn't a fun time.",

When it starts off, Casino feels a lot like Goodfellas all over again, but with more fun. However, once the story kicks in, you can find it's key differences from the other works of the director. The film has fine performances from De Niro, Pesci and Sharon Stone (in particular). Casino tells the story of greed and lust for money and it tells the tale with style and sufficient grit. The film has a good ending also and sadly Pesci plays the same kind of role he played in Goodfellas.",

However, when we finally did get it, not everyone was left as satisfied as they had hoped to be. Casino provides more of the same of what we've come to typically expect from Scorsese as a director; whether that's graphic violence, Italian stereotypes, blatant/excessive/vulgar language, and even the occasional domestic violence. However, just because Casino isn't very original, that doesn't necessarily mean that the film has nothing to offer. If there's at least one thing that can be taken away from this film, it's undoubtedly the performances. Robert De Niro does well as the perfectionist gambler turned casino manager, Ace. Joe Pesci, while not as comical or over-the-top here as in Goodfellas, still gives a nevertheless entertainingly violent, if mostly restrained, performance. I think it was pretty obvious that Scorsese wasn't going to top Goodfellas, or ever could for that matter; I mean, how could he? After all, Goodfellas is renowned by many (including myself) as his undisputed masterpiece even to this day and is as perfect as a gangster film can get. Hell, this film is essentially Goodfellas in a Las Vegas casino setting anyway, so I couldn't help but compare the two and everything that this film does, Goodfellas does significantly better. I think Scorsese just felt as if he was obligated to do another film but didn't really have anything new to offer us, so he just rehashed one of his previous films and the subsequent result is Casino. Despite all that though, I still think that Casino is ultimately a solid and entertaining film but doesn't amount to anything more than simply that, especially in comparison to some of Scorsese's more innovative and memorable work.",

Sharon Stone I believe gave her best performance to date and completely worthy of her Golden Globe win and Academy Award nomination, playing Ginger McKenna a hustler who De Niro's character Ace Rothstein falls in love with at first sight which proves to be the first of Ace's mistakes in the movie. De Niro delivers a flawless performance which is as sharp as the suits his character wears. De Niro plays as a low level mob associate who is tasked with running the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas, Ace tries to keep the day to day running of the casino and the \"skim\" as smooth as possible until childhood friend Nicky comes to town.",

He has created some of the most bold, compelling, relevant, complex and beautiful films of all time. \"Casino\" is one of them.\n\nI've seen many of Scorsese's films, and this is film, as well as arguably the greatest film ever made \"Taxi Driver\", that I always come back to.\n\nAs far as Scorsese's gangster films go, everybody goes to \"GoodFellas\". Now, \"GoodFellas\" is a masterpiece, but I may be the only one who prefers \"Casino\" to \"GoodFellas\" and \"The Departed\" and Scorsese's other films of the like. Now, the reason that is, is because this is Scorsese's most finitely detailed film to date.

This is a big, bold and grandiose movie that is typical of the esteemed filmmaker, but he covers a lot of well-known territory and re-visits a lot of themes and plot devices he has dealt with before.\n\nStill, no one tells a story quite like Scorcese and here he re-teams with screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi who wrote the novel that this is based on, and the end result is a vibrant film despite its familiarity. It's full of violence, humor and great, larger-than-life characters, beautifully brought to life by this exceptional cast.\n\nRobert DeNiro knows this part very well, mostly because he's played it a time or two before, and Sharon Stone gets her first real chance to show what she can do with a great part. However, it's Joe Pesci who really shines here once again, playing a variation on the same character he played in \"Good Fellas\". Granted it's the showiest part in the film, but there's a reason that Pesci keeps getting cast in these roles. Quite simply, he's electric on the screen.\n\nEven though the film (and the novel before it) is a work of fiction, you get a real sense of the history of Las Vegas from this, and I mean the real history, This isn't the lesson you're going to learn in school, but it sure feels authentic enough. \"Casino\" doesn't rank as one of Scorcese's best, but even a good film from the director is better than almost anything else in theaters. It's not exactly groundbreaking, but it is a compelling, captivating film that is exceedingly entertaining.",

Scorsese might be the only director in history to sustain such rapid fire, intense power on screen for that long. It's classic DeNiro and Pesci, enough said. The real unique gem of a performance in this movie belongs to Sharon Stone. She's plays a character about as despicable as the mobsters themselves, and fascinatingly enough, you'll tend to root against her. It's Scorsese's oldest tactic, which is to make you interested in awful people, and perhaps seeing the traits of them that are overlooked.

Aside from a 24 karat cast, the visuals and narration by De Niro steal the show. In fact, it's as if the Casino itself becomes a character. The 3 hours carry you through the procedural functions and operation of casino management and security with charismatic technique and an influential style. I'd even say that Casino's capture of process and action is something to study, something visually stunning, something I wouldn't say, however, is to sacrifice three hours of your time to admire Casino's outstanding cinematography.

However, Ace's mobster best friend (Pesci) and ex-hustler wife (Stone) threaten to topple a multimillion dollar mafia empire. \n\nThe film combines elements of drama, comedy, and even sprinklings of documentary as we are educated on nearly every aspect of running the corrupt casino via lovely tracking shots.\n\nA criticism of this film is that it is overly long and \"boring\" to many audience members, perhaps resembling Scorcese's previous mob flick GoodFellas a little too much stylistically. Another is that the film is exceedingly ugly with its bright and flashy set pieces, gaudy wardrobe and fast camera movements. While I can see where these criticisms come from, it doesn't change the fact that this is an excellent film that does an excellent job mimicking the fast paced and decidedly garish city in which it is set.",

            "content": "Casino is very similar to Martin Scorsese's previous gangster effort, Goodfellas. It largely follows the same distinct style, brings over many of the people that made Goodfellas and is a second acclaimed gangster tale.\nCasino exposes the underworld of Gambling by revealing the corruption and violence in the town of Las Vegas before they became about corporations. It dramatises just how evil the source of gambling is, and just how violent people would become in the corrupt world of gambling. It educates viewers on the past and takes them on a 3 hour journey to teach people just what kind of hell lay beneath the expensive and glamourous buildings of Las Vegas.\nBut Casino is full of talking, and there is a lot of it. I found it to be overloaded with excessive talking over a period of 3 hours and a lot of predictable plot dynamics which never really took me by surprise. I found that to a certain extent, Casino was generic. It just seemed like it was a piece of the dying spirit of Martin Scorsese's older films, and in particular his collaborations with Robert De Niro in their final teaming up together. It just doesn't have the originality or dramatic impact that their films like Goodfellas or Taxi Driver did, and it feels like it's a story that's all been told before. Even though it does educate viewers on the history of casino crime, it just doesn't seem all that interesting this time around. Its kind of odd, but Casino has a story that's not the best to choose, yet Martin Scorsese finds a good way to do it. \nLuckily, Martin Scorsese's taught direction does ensure that Casino fits in as a visual experience which benefits from the fine style of the film, the strong script, the fine cinematography and the sufficient amount of violence to entertain viewers in the mood for a visual experience. His gritty touch on the story is successful, and the cast manages to keep the power of the story up.\nRobert De Niro is, as ususal, powerful and strongly dramatic as a lead. His charisma is as strong as ever and he carries the story strongly, supplying fine line delivery and strong grip over the script to ensure that finding an issue with him is a challenge.\nBut really, it's Joe Pesci who is again, absolutely awesome in his third collaboration with Martin Scorsese. His aggression is intense and despite his small size his furious talent for line delivery manages to seriously intimidate audiences very well in the blink of an eye and make a continuously entertaining and memorable presence for viewers to remember Casino by being a constantly powerful entity of a character.\nBut its Sharon Stone who is the surprisingly strongest part of the cast. In her finest lead role not to feature such sexually suggestive nudity she reminds us that she can in fact act and she can do it very well without using her body as a distraction in Casino by using a gripping tenacity over her lines and emotions to secure an Academy Award nomination for her talents.\n\nSo Although Casino is not one of Martin Scorsese's finest efforts and can be boring and prolonged at times, it still stands as a well acted and well made piece of cinema.",

Additionally, the set designs and costumes do an incredible job at showing the extravagance and decadency of '70s Las Vegas.

The casino racket plot (along with all the other subplots) all start at their highs and tumble down to failures. The only Controlling Idea I can think of is that crime will always fail because of greed. The Story Chart for Casino is not very interesting, basically everything crumbles because of the characters are up to no good.\n\nMy main beef with the movie is two fold.\n\nOne is specific about this movie: why make a movie about crime that fails when no one in the movie does any good at all and there is no moral center to the film? Since everyone is up to no good, the only rational way to keep our attention is to up the ante on how bad the characters become and how cool they when they are being bad.So a film whose central idea is about the inevitable downfall of crime betrays its central idea by making the characters \"cool\" and full of \"attitude\" and glorifying them. Seriously why do we need a movie like this? It seems to just perpetuate all the negative stereotypes about movies glorifying violence and bad characters.\n\nMy second beef is in general about Martin Scorsese. I feel films like Casino and many of his other works are mostly show-and-tells rather than true storytelling by characters, conflict and consequence. This shows through most obviously through the abundant voice overs that tell us how \"cool\" the characters are and tells us the changes that are happening as opposed to showing us through action and consequence. I think voice overs are the nemesis of absorbing movie making and Casino spends about half its time with its characters voicing over stuff that happens on screen: its like a holiday slide-show from \"cool\" gangsters.\n\nI think Casino tries to objectively document a period of Vegas excess driven by a few characters and their criminal ways. It's voice overs certainly make it documentary-like. But its glorification of how cool these guys subjectively tells us to sympathize with these criminals on their inevitable demise.\n\nI don't get it, why make a movie that suggests crime doesn't pay but suggest it's cool to be a criminal? How does this make the world a better place? If it doesn't, why make movies at all?\n\nhttp://www.storycharts.ca/story/118044/5275456790069248/Film/Casino",

            "content": "After bringing us the outstanding 1990 crime drama GoodFellas, critically acclaimed director Martin Scorsese, author/screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, and stars Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci team up again for another crime drama five years later called Casino. What's interesting about Casino is that it's basically GoodFellas all over again only set in Las Vegas. It's a good thing no one came up with the idea of naming this film GoodFellas in Las Vegas, since it would make it all the more obvious to us that they're trying to recreate the same movie. That being said, does the fact that Casino bares countless similarities to GoodFellas make it bad? Not at all, it's simply a way of summarizing the movie in a nutshell. Regardless, let's take a deeper look at what we've got. \n\nCasino tells the story of a Mafia member named Sam Rothstein (Robert DeNiro) who is sent to Las Vegas to run a casino funded by the Mafia on behalf of mob families living in the Midwest. His friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is also eventually sent to Las Vegas to watch his back. The main reason they are both there is to oversee the casino operations which largely centers on illegal activity. Basically, the Mafia has rigged the casino so that none of the customers win anything, and they make millions of dollars off of their money without the customers knowing a thing about it. Essentially, Sam and Nicky are there to make sure that their \"skim\" goes according to plan. But all of that changes however when a fellow hustler named Ginger (Sharon Stone) enters their lives and eventually interferes with their business to the point where there's no way they could possibly fix whatever costly mistakes erupt. \n\nThe first couple minutes of Casino, when we're being introduced to the process of how these Mafia-ruled casinos work, are arguably where the most fascinating part of the entire picture resides. We not only learn that the scamming this casino gets away with on a regular basis is supposedly normal, but we are also given the scary conclusion that wasting money on gambling is the main reason people go to Las Vegas in the first place. It definitely makes people who haven't been to Las Vegas before question whether or not they want to go out of their way to a city in the middle of a desert just to lose vast sums of money. I know that it wouldn't be a town I'd want to go to yet based on what I've seen here. So I thought Casino had a fairly strong introduction based on the kind of world it was introducing us to. \n\nThe rest of the film was pretty decent with Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci turning in strong acting just like they did with GoodFellas. However, I felt that most of the main narrative was not as compelling or focused as I wanted it to be. The storytelling simply felt a little fragmented for my taste, and the love story between DeNiro and Stone doesn't help with that either. For the record, I respect that the love story does contribute to the events that take place in the second half of the film. Also, Roger Ebert's comments on how different this love story is compared with the love stories in Martin Scorsese's previous works are justified to a certain degree. Regardless, the love story still didn't do much for me at all and I think a crucial reason for that is Sharon Stone. \n\nI don't think I've seen much of her work and the ones that I do recall seeing aside from this film are Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Antz. In my opinion, from what I've seen, she looks physically great, but her acting is too over-the-top for my liking. I'm having trouble placing my finger on it, but something about her acting just seems inappropriate for the movies she stars in. While I acknowledge that some of her roles including this one require her to be very dramatic, she has the distinction of being too childishly over dramatic that she ends up feeling way out of place in her films, this one included. \n\nWhile I still think Joe Pesci acts out his role reasonably well here, his role is maybe a little too identical to his work in GoodFellas. And although I do feel that the story does lose focus around the halfway point, for some reason, I still find Casino watchable enough for me to recommend it overall. And again, this is mainly because of the theories this film shows us regarding how a mob-run casino would operate. There's a well-directed scene involving the casino managers asking a customer to leave because he is placing his feet on the casino tables. Without revealing too much, the payoff of this scene isn't quite what you'd expect at first. The same thing could be said for another scene involving the casino managers dealing with someone who is maybe having too good a day at their casino. If that scene doesn't scare you off from playing and winning too much at a casino, I don't know what will. \n\nIf you're looking for a story and characters that will impact you the same way Scorsese's earlier films like GoodFellas did, you might be disappointed by what Casino offers. However, if you're looking for a picture with a fascinating premise that introduces creative theories along the way and will settle for something that is at least watchable, then I think you'll like this film fine enough. As for me, though I don't think Casino ranks among Scorsese's best by a good bit and I probably don't have that much interest in looking at it again, I was satisfied enough with seeing it once. Like Las Vegas itself, approach at your own financial risk.",

Anyway, Martin Scorsese goes back to his roots with Casino showing brutally realistic gangster violence and profanity. Is it over-the-top? Maybe. But that is necessary. It wouldn't get its point across if it wasn't over-the-top. Casino also represents something much larger. The rise and fall of an empire, through corruption.",

There's something undeniably spellbinding about the interplay between Stone, De Niro, and Pesci that makes this film transcend the crime genre and turns it into an intimate character study on how greed, betrayal, jealously, neurotics, and hatred can systematically tear apart even the most composed of people. De Niro's slow spiral into destruction is fascinating to watch, particularly as his typical roles are much more in control of things.\n\nDirectorial, Scorcese hits his pinnacle here. The combination of the musical scoring, the shots at the Riviera and surrounding areas of Vegas, and the pace at which the film is cut somehow make this near 3 hour film feel like it's over just when it's starting. \n\nEasily one of my favourite films of all time and arguably Scorsese's opus.",

            "content": "Five years after delivering one the mob genre's finest films in \"GoodFellas\", director Martin Scorsese reunited with screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi and several of the same actors - mainly Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci - to focus on another true-life crime story. This time he takes it away from the mean streets of New York and focuses on the deserts of Las Vegas. The results may be highly similar but they're just as impressive.\n Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert DeNiro) is a smooth and ambitious type that moves out to Las Vegas to become the operator of the Tangiers Casino. Things go well for him until his volatile childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) arrives to get in on the action and Sam falls in love with conniving, unbalanced and untrustworthy, showgirl Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). Before long, a cycle of drugs and violence ensues while Sam struggles to hold onto his casino license and the mob back home are less than happy with the results.\n The hallmarks of Scorsese's style and structure - that were so prevalent in \"GoodFellas\" -  are all on show again here. He has his usual reliable cast, delivering voiceover narrations that take us through the events and there is regular use of classic tracks from The Rolling Stones. His directorial techniques and are also on show; from flash-cuts to freeze-frames, crash zooms and montages. In other words, Scorsese is doing it all over again and it's these very techniques and stylistic flourishes that have drawn some criticism Casino's way for being too similar to his aforementioned crime classic. To some extent, I can understand these gripes. There is definitely a feeling of repetition and lack of originality in it's approach. The most obvious comparison being the casting of Joe Pesci. As good as Pesci is (and he is very good) it may have served Scorsese better to cast someone else in that role. The character is too similar to Pesci's Oscar winning Tommy DeVito. I'd liked to have seen (another Scorsese regular) Harvey Keitel, for example, just to mix things up a bit and he's proven beforehand that he's an actor that plays off DeNiro very well. That being said, there is an argument of 'if it ain't broke, dont fix it'. It does tread old ground and doesn't really bring anything fresh to the table but it's old ground that's worth treading again. Where Scorsese does succeed, is in his casting of DeNiro. In \"Goodfellas\", DeNiro was underused but here he delivers some solid work. He has a less showy role than those around him, making it easy to overlook just how effortless he is. He's rarely offscreen for the entire 3 hours of the film and shows an absolutely commanding reservation. Other great inclusions in the cast are a weasel like James Woods and a surprisingly outstanding Sharon Stone. She takes a back seat in the early stages but when she properly enters the fray, she delivers a very powerful and layered performance and the convincing catalyst for the unravelling of the characters' indulgent lifestyles. She was rightfully Oscar nominated for her work here and very unlucky not to win. It's a testament to these committed performances and Scorsese's expertise that this film still manages to stand alone as a very fine piece of cinema in it's own right. Added to which, the lavish production design by Dante Ferretti and Robert Richardson's sublime cinematography bring the whole glitz, glamour and corruption of Las Vegas to fruition. \n An enthralling and intimate portrayal of the decline of the mob in the 1970's. It may not be as tightly constructed as \"GoodFellas\" but how many film's are or ever will be? If this is the only criticism that can be appointed to Casino then there's no point criticising at all. Another fine addition to Scorsese's canon.\n\nMark Walker",

From a stellar cast of regulars - De Niro, Pesci and a new addition Stone as a drug-crazed double-crosser, as the film ticks along the stakes get ever higher. Sure, the director is treading extremely familiar ground but he does so with remarkable style. It makes sense that he would continue to reassemble the old crew because, unlike many of the characters in this film, his go-to mob actors can always be relied upon even when the pacing feels a little too deliberate or the narration becomes a bit bombarding. De Niro takes a markedly different approach in his portrayal of a put-upon crook with a heart who, in the end, is really looking out for his kid. It gives the film a much-needed moral center especially when we are seeing him being typecast all too often. Perhaps the fact that this film lives in the shadow of Goodfellas is inevitable but it could be said that lightning nearly struck twice for Scorsese.",

Casino is another tale of true crime adapted from a literary works by Nicolas Pileggi (also the man who wrote Goodfellas and helped adapt its film transition), except this time the tale is less focused on one singular fall and instead broadened into the fall of titans who almost had greatness within their reaches.  Just as Pesci says at the beginning, \"we fucked it all up, it should have been great...\".\n\nWhat makes me love Casino is its powerful cast that showcases the good from nearly everybody, especially Stone who plays DeNiro's hustler wife who in the end loses sight of her own life.Though it does stretch it's run time, Casino is  brilliantly acted, well constructed, and gorgeously rendered. The film is a brutal look at the mob's control over Vegas during the mid seventies so expect the same flashes and tuned up style that came from Goodfellas with all the violence and musical choices kicked up a notch.  \n\nOne of my favorite Scorsese films!
