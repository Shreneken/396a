Most of the movie taking place in the capsule does a excellent job of keeping tension and focus. The only minor fault is there is A LOT of technical jargon that can be difficult to understand if your not super well adversed in Engineering or that kind of stuff but the big picture stuff (CO2, Heat Shield, Etc.) they do a great job of explaining to laymen like myself.  However everything else was done so flawlessly that it didn't hamper the overall experience at all. This is a All Time Classic Movie in general and everyone should see it.",

The cast, which includes Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Sinise, among others, is impressive.  The performances are great.  The special effects are…well…effective.  The story of the failed Apollo 13 space mission is compelling and creates genuine suspense, despite the fact that the outcome is no secret.  Where the movie is lacking is Howard's uninspired direction, a paint-by-numbers Hollywood style that never dares to be different, a trait that Howard has developed over his long and successful directorial career.  His films are consistently good, but never seem to reach the level of greatness.",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite \"Based off of a true story movies\" and it is pretty darn accurate too. Ron Howard saw his dream of revisiting the Apollo 13 space mission come true and he did so in  such an emotionally investing and captivating way, he shows us the astronauts in space, their families back on earth, and mission control all throughout the movie and each one has it part to play in the story and they all work beautifully. I really felt for the families of the men in space, they were truly frightened that they may never see their father/husbands again. Mission Control felt very involved and they communicated effectively to Apollo 13, but the most important aspect of mission control that was nailed in this movie, is that when it was time check in with them, it was never boring, it didn't break up the momentum of a previous scene or ever feel out of place, and they also weren't in the movie too much. As for the acting, Tom Hanks was excellent, per the norm, he really brought the veteran presence and leadership that this movie needed to be successful. Bill Paxton was really good as well, but he wasn't a part of the movie as much as we would have liked him to be, he spends a bit throwing up in a corner, and for a lot of the third act, he's basically frozen and just floating around in the ship. Kevin Bacon was my personal favorite in this movie, he was the unexpierienced rookie who was always questioning mission controls orders after the explosion, he was terrified and I really felt his fear through his performance. Ed Harris and Gary Sinise were both excellent in mission control.  The cinematography is gorgeous in this film, the shot are wide and are not quick cut. The CGI was also really good, nothing that I saw on screen wasn't believable. The best thing about this movie in my opinion is the script, it allowed for so much characterization and emotion to be crafted across the entire film, the dialogue as well is very good, so many memorable quotes and you learn about the characters through what they say very well. I also liked the fact that after the explosion in space happened, everybody said that they are going to die, their was always someone their to say that they would be fine, and the optimism in this movie is so essential to the entire journey. Overall, this is a really good movie based off of a true story that must be viewed by many, but is not for everybody. I adore this movie and will keep coming back to it for many years to come.

            "content": "This is one of those films that I would consider overrated not because I don't think it's a good film but for all of the praise that gets heaped on it for being one of the best films of the 1990s. It's a solid film that's very good places but it also faces it's lulls and has that unfortunate decent but never brilliant sheen that always rests over Ron Howard directed films. It's probably one of the best films about astronauts, up there with The Right Stuff (1983) and Marooned (1969), but it features actors essentially playing themselves and doesn't illuminate the experiences of working in a stressful job in the way that The Right Stuff does. I would definitely say that you should watch this, I saw it in school, but don't go in expecting the masterpiece it has been heralded as.\n\nAstronauts Jim Lovell, Tom Hanks, Jack Swigert, Kevin Bacon and Fred Haise, Bill Paxton, will serve as the crew that flies on the Apollo 13 aircraft in April of 1970 as Swigert replaces the ill Ken Mattingly, Gary Sinise, who resents this decision. The men quickly encounter problems when they are launched into space and it is up to the men and their flight commander on the ground Gene Kranz, Ed Harris, to get themselves back to earth alive. It will require some tough maneuvers and everybody pitching in, including Mattingly, to get the men home safely.\n\nThe film does a good job at building tension even as we know that these men will survive, an often stated view on this film but nevertheless true. We get to learn about Lovell's relationship with his wife Marilyn, Kathleen Quinlan, before we see him as an astronaut which makes us invested in him when his life is threatened. We feel that we know these men personally because their struggles are relatable, we've all worried for a family member or been passed over for a job at least once in our lives, and as they have tense discussions about flight plans we are engaged because we like these men and want to see them succeed. This is what so many disaster movies miss as they expect us to be invested in the lives of people just because they are threatened without showing what they will be missing out on in life.\n\nThe performances are all solid if unremarkable as Howard assembles Hanks, Harris, Sinise, Bacon, Paxton and Quinlan to perform admirably in an ensemble drama. I would not have given this film the Academy Award nominations it received for acting as Quinlan and Harris are serviceable but not superlative in a year that gave us Illeana Douglas in To Die For (1995) and Clive Russell in Margaret's Museum (1995). Hanks pulls a Captain Phillips (2013) and just plays himself but his charm is enough to carry the performance and his accessibility allows even the least interested viewer to become invested. Howard is typically good with actors as shown in his best film, The Paper (1994), and here he uses a reliable cast to great effect, if only he had brought that skill to A Beautiful Mind (2001).\n\nI would not considered Howard to be one of the best directors working today but he did deserve recognition for his work on this film as he adapts the story to the screen artfully. He makes all the right decisions as he steps around having too much focus on the technical aspects of the mission and doesn't over saturate the film with details about the personal lives of the characters. We are pushed far enough to earn an emotional response but not so far that we are resentful of the manipulation. In any case he did a better job than Mel Gibson did on Braveheart (1995) and we could have avoided the infamous 2001 Best Picture win had he been rewarded at this point.\n\nYou can watch this film anywhere with anybody and I suppose that's one of the reasons for it's enduring popularity but mostly it's just a very well made, tense film. Howard's direction and the skillful storytelling raise the film above the rest and although it's not perfect it deserves praise.",

The movie made me feel incredibly empathetic. Once the men were stranded in space, I was hanging onto everything that happened in the film. It made me think how incredibly terrifying that must have been for the men and their families. I donâ(TM)t feel that Iâ(TM)ve seen enough films within this particular genre to be able to compare, but I felt that this one was profound and very professional and there isnâ(TM)t anything I would have done differently. In terms of writing, I most enjoyed when Jimâ(TM)s son expressed his concern over his dad getting safely to the moon while Marilyn listened on in the background. It sets up the stakes for the film because the prior spaceship that had been sent off didnâ(TM)t make it safely. I also really enjoyed the line that the film ended with when Jim says, âwhen would we be going back, and who would that be?â? It was such a great way to end the film - on a high note and to leave the audience with something to think about. In regard to the directing, my favorite shot was when Jimâ(TM)s wife is having a bad dream about Jim being sucked out of the spaceship and it goes into an extreme close-up of her eye opening and looking around. I also particularly enjoyed the shots that took place inside the spacecraft. They were all tilted, which offered an interesting perspective of the alternate reality the men have to get used to within the spacecraft. In general, I feel that the editing that was done between what was going on in the rocket along with what was going on in the command center was done really well. There was a lot of editing between reactions to what is happening and what is actually happening which really heightened the tension and added to the dramatization of each step in the process. When the guys realize they arenâ(TM)t going to the moon thereâ(TM)s a very pregnant pause, which was a great example of pacing. In regard to acting, my favorite scene was when they tell Ken that he canâ(TM)t be on Apollo 13. Everyone was listening really well with each other; the scene wasnâ(TM)t big and angry when it could easily have been performed that way. Overall, the cinematography was wonderful, and my favorite scene was when they did the urine dump from the spaceship. Everything sprays out of the ship in front of the stars. It was a really cool shot! The sound design was probably my favorite part of the film. The swell of the music when the guys get on the spacecraft accentuated the momentous moment. Then when the rocket takes off, itâ(TM)s not overwhelmingly loud but thereâ(TM)s so much sound and depth of sound that you can tell something huge and powerful is happening",

            "content": "NASA's Finest Hour told in Two\nApollo 13 is a perfect example of how the underappreciated hands of filmmaking can fine-tune an otherwise cable channel documentary into a noteworthy historical film. Apollo 13 had 7 Oscar nominations, only 2 of which were nods towards the actors.  It is a perfectly woven tapestry of music, sound effects, visual display and direction, brought together by a versatile and flawless cast. Echoing the very mission it depicted, the cast and crew of Apollo 13 (some legends in their own right) worked together as team with a common goal- with no one player competing for the spotlight and glory.\n     Directed by the legendary Ron Howard, this based-on-true-events drama tells the story a failed lunar mission. It had been less than a year since man first walked on the Moon, but as far as the astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and the American public was concerned, Apollo 13 was just another routine mission. Before diving into the events of Apollo 13- ultimately deemed NASA's finest hour, the movie starts with the Apollo 11 lunar landing -NASA's biggest victory. Opening with literal trumpets- a James Horner signature, Hollywood's soundtrack specialist stayed true to his brass-laden compositions, laying the perfect auditory background fit to carry impeccably written dialogue and carefully chosen archived news reports.\n\tJust as the set directors Michael Corenblith and Meredith Boswell settle the audience into the brown nostalgic couches of the era with Jimi Hendrix, The Who and Jefferson Airplane in their ear, the viewer is jolted back into the gravity of the film with the famous phrase, \"Houston, we have a problem.\" Stranded 205,000 miles from Earth in a crippled spacecraft, the scheduled moon landing is called off. It is at this point in the film we see the emerging and meshing of unique contributions that turned individuals into heros. The triangular synergy of the astronauts, mission control and the family on Earth created a triangular synergy that was captured by the performances of Bacon, Hanks, Paxton, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan (playing Jim Lovell's wife Marilyn) and Jean Speegle Howard (as Blanch, Lovell's mother).  \n     It may have seemed that only the astronauts spent the better part of the seven day mission in a claustrophobic space capsule, but Mission Control, Marilyn and Blanch had their own types of confinement. Mission Control- led by Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) was tied to the constraints of limited technology, time and the very laws of physics. Marilyn and Blanch were confined to boxes that gave them news and information but little hope that their Jimmy would return alive. The cast collected to portray this symbiotic triangle possessed the same blend of raw genius, humility and versatility as the real heros behind the Apollo 13 rescue. Any tensions within the crew (movie or mission) that threaten the prime objective became an opportunity to project confidence and produce solutions- solutions like making a CO2 filter in space with a sock and cover of the flight plan, or salving the fears of the astronauts' children by demonstrating unwavering faith. \n     Much like the actual mission and rescue, the re-creation of Apollo 13 was not created in a Hollywood bubble. NASA equipment and aircrafts were used to film the zero-gravity scenes. Jim Lovell, who made a cameo at the end of the movie, lent the transcripts from his autobiographical account of the events. Astronauts, crew members, family and media from the actual mission were interviewed to help solidify the script and sharpen the scene sequence and set designs. \n     This was the perfect story to brought to life at the perfect time when technology could impactfully articulate to an audience the true peril these three astronauts were in and the literal gathering of the world to bring them home. Remember, this is a story that has been re-told multiple times. It is through painstaking lengths that Ron Howard went to create new footage, not simply re-use and re-organize previous narrations and imagines. It is with the tool of technology enhanced with perfectly curated music of the era and a symphony of brass compliments of James Horner that gave Al Reinert and Robert Legato a place for their script and special effects. \n     While some may say Apollo 13 is an outdated film, we are reminded that it is important to replay significant moments in history to remind ourselves how problems can be constructed into solutions with considerable collaboration. NASA's finest hour was finally told using Hollywood storytelling at its best. Apollo 13 may not have been a major box office hit, if there is one thing we learned is there is such a thing as a \"successful failure\".",

You feel like you are in the ship with these astronauts. Howard also lets you understand how hard it is for the families of NASA's team members to endure these flights. Apollo 13 is a phenomenal historical drama that plays out more like an epic disaster film.\n\nApollo 13's cast is filled with excellent character actors that all deliver heartfelt performances. Tom Hanks, Kathleen Quinlan, Gary Sinese, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, and Ed Harris are particularly wonderful to behold in Apollo 13. These actors bring these incredible real events to life with a genuine quality that comes across the screen. Their emotions and desires are felt by you through these highly expressive depictions. I think Apollo 13 is as much a display of believable acting as it is a recreation of historical moments.\n\nJames Horner delivers an emotive score that grips your heartstrings with each tender note. The scary sequences are elevated by Horner's tense score as well as the intimate familial scenes are grounded by his gentle sounds. Apollo 13 keeps you in the moment with its tense scenes in addition to Horner's classical music.\n\nIn short, Apollo 13 is a must see American classic. It may have been released in 1995, but it looks like it could have been made currently. The effects, story, acting, and direction all hold water to date. I think you could play Apollo 13 in a classroom as a time piece of the late 1960's and early 1970's. It is that good.",

Whether it's a flashy blockbuster or a low budget drama, ageing is a curse that thousands of films succumb to. Apollo 13 though, still feels fresh when watching it today. Not because it's the depiction of a true event or the talented cast on screen (but that does help!), it's the direction. This was made to showcase the technical prowess and finesse that Ron Howard has in making, what I call, a Hollywood movie. James Horner for musical score, Tom Hanks as lead actor...it has all the ingredients for a 90's classic that Hollywood love to serve up. It works, so no complaints here. Let's talk about Ron Howard, he was superb directing this. His style, ever so consistent, yet always changing. Still shots, tracking shots, POV shots...you name it, he's probably included it. Tom Hanks was charming as always, Kevin Bacon's smile just steals every scene and Bill Paxton's nervous outbursts were relatable. Bringing in Ed Harris as the flight director was a smart move, he oozes confidence and brings in the acting experience to keep us hooked. It's a bittersweet true story, our astronauts venture towards the moon where an unforeseen event occurs that prevents them from landing on the surface. A landmark event, and yet they couldn't achieve it. I honestly had sympathy for our characters, seeing their dreams being crushed within hours. I also appreciated the friction between Jack and the crew, being a newcomer is always difficult and I thought that was presented well. The effects for the most part hold up decently, the rocket launch though...not so well. The background looked like Google Earth or Flight Simulator, could've been handled better even in 1995. It is a safe and familiar structure with not many thrills in store, a disadvantage for any well documented true event with a happy ending. In saying that, I was captivated and enthralled by the science and entranced by the performances. Ron Howard did a damn good job who deserves more recognition.",

I figured since it was in my want to see list on Flixster, I rented this with other films to get some films off my list. So for this, I really enjoyed this film for what it is. The acting is pretty solid, and the story is well-told that respects the real life people that were actually involved with the event.  The visual effects are the highlight of the film as to this day, they look really good and realistic that really shows the believability of the actors acting around in zero gravity. It's tense at some points, and you get enough of the characterization of the crew that you want them to survive the event, even if you know what already happened. The only issue that I do have with this, is the pacing. There are some slow moments that are a bit often than it should've, andthat wasn't quite an easy sit for me and just felt long, even though it's suppose to be suspenseful. Apollo 13 is a great film that while it doesn't have that much replay value to it, it's a good enough film for a first-time watcher that you get something out of it that stick with you.",

Firstly, I bought this movie yesterday (new) for $4 on DVD and I've never seen it before. Secondly, my review shall begin after this sentence. Let me just start off with the audio because it is REALLY sharp and loud for a non Blu-Ray format movie, in particular, the music. James Horner's 5-star score couldn't have sounded better; it packs so much in emotion, tension, and restrained patriotism. The movie could be described in the same way, and when I say tense, I mean, tense. The first hour went by so fast that I had to check my phone to make sure I was looking at the right time. This is a \"based on a true story\" film where we know that it all ends well, yet, the way \"Apollo 13\" is written/directed/etc--it's hard to describe, but the movie feels like Paxton, Hanks, & Bacon might not make it ...even though we KNOW they do. Across the board, the movie is well done: the dialogue is there, the visuals are there, and the acting's there. You couldn't ask for a better film; the ending is so triumphant (again, James Horner's music BOOSTS that scene so much) that even 2013's \"Gravity\" seems to have missed the mark by comparison.",

I can just about remember seeing the news footage of the return of crew Earth after their ill-fated mission when I was a child and this film does so much to show the bravery and inventiveness of the people involved. Tom Hanks leads the cast giving one of his stand-out performances. Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise and Ed Harris are all equally good in their various roles, with Harris in particular putting in a commanding performance. The effects in this film are terrific, bringing vividly to life the drama of a rocket launch and the journey into space. I find the shots of the capsule drifting through space particularly impressive as they seem to bring home just how far away and isolated the men actually were. This mission that went so wrong, could have ended in tragedy. Instead, the tenacity and ingenuity of a dedicated team turned it into something of a triumph. What Ron Howard did with this movie was dramatise these events with great care and attention to detail. I have watched this film many times and always find it both inspiring and gripping. It has everything that you could ask for in a drama and was been brought to the screen by a team who clearly cared a great deal about what they were doing. It is indeed a fitting tribute to the brave men who flew on Apollo 13, the ground crew who supported them and the families that waited for their safe return.",

Ron Howard chose his casts right and they did great; Tom Hanks, Ed Harris especially.

It's joyously scary to watch human beings rocket into space, and the mood and tone of the characters never gets too bleak even when they have many reasons to despair.

What has always amazed me is that, even when you know the outcome of the mission it is still tense and exciting. They have compiled a number of moments that will get your heart pounding and have you worrying about the well-being of the 3 astronauts. I'm always impressed when a movie is able to keep me emotionally invested even when I've seen it dozens of times. But my absolute favorite scenes don't even take place in space. The way that the technicians at mission control have to troubleshoot so many different problems is fascinating to me. It's like a series of little puzzles that they must work together to solve. It doesn't hurt that I love Ed Harris' acting.\n\nThe rest of the cast is amazing too. Most notable are the performances of the 3 astronauts. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton play off each other perfectly. There are so many moments when you can read exactly what they're thinking without them saying a word. I think what holds me back from calling Apollo 13 one of my all-time favorite films is the length. It feels like they have filled the movie with a bit too much material and every time I watch I can't help thinking \"Well, that scene was unnecessary.\" Almost everything with the Lovell family feels very forced as if they're trying to coerce the audience into an emotional reaction instead of letting it happen naturally. Then there are the numerous times when they cut to news reports to reiterate the stakes for us. There comes a point where it starts to feel condescending that they keep telling us and then retelling us what is happening. Once or twice is enough, thank you. Apollo 13 is still a great film that did some truly remarkable things. If they could have trimmed it down it could have been one of the best movies of all time.",

The film tells the incredible story about the events surrounding the Apollo 13 mission before, during, and after the launch, including the preparation, conflict, launch, flight, disaster (explosion) on the ship while in space on the way to the moon, and the fight to get the astronauts back to Earth.  The film has an amazing use of visual effects, and sound effects, creating beauty and realism in the film.  The film is also brought to life by Ron Howard's incredible direction that never got an Oscar nod (what the hell?!).  The film not only focuses on the problem in NASA's, Jim Lovell's, Fred Haise's, and Jack Swigert's point of view and experience on the incident, but also on the effect of their friends, families, the country, and the entire world as an accident like that never happened before.  The film also has stellar performances, but the one that's more convincing and believable is Ed Harris in his Oscar-nominated portrayal as White team Flight Director Gene Kranz, thanks to his moments of showing confidence and determination to get Lovell, Haise, and Swigert back home.  Another great performance is Kathleen Quinn in her Oscar-nominated portrayal as Marilyn Lovell, Jim's wife, as she always expresses concern and anxiety towards her husband going on the mission, as well as dealing with the incident, the family issues, and facing the truth that it's actually happening.  The film has perfect timing of tension, laughs, and pure drama, making this one of the greatest biographical films of all time.  The film also benefits from William Broyles, Jr.'s and Al Reinert's script that was adapted from Jim Lovell's book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13.  The film has perfect scientific accuracy, smart dialogue, and historical inaccuracies that we leave out, such as the reworded quotes that have since become famous like \"Houston, we have a problem\", and \"Failure is not an option\", and the timing of the on-board explosion.  The film also has an amazing score, thanks to composer James Horner.  A film that should be seen by all as it tells an incredible story that will never be forgotten.",

The ending didn't quite pull at my heartstrings, but the journey that these three men went on did. Their ordeal got to me, especially through Tom Hanks' character. It's overly long, but enjoyable.  \r\n\r\nIt's the true story of Apollo 13, the spacecraft flown by three astronauts not long after Neil Armstrong landed on the moon. Everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong with the ship. The three astronauts (Hanks, Bacon, Paxton) must try everything possible in order to survive the journey home.\r\n\r\nThere are some nail-biting scenes in this movie, addressing issues such as Carbon-Dioxide levels rising too high, and the temperature falling so low that the condensation turned to ice. The cinematography and the music also add a very exciting atmosphere to these scenes. It truly makes you feel like you're there with these men. Sometimes they had to hold their breath, and I found myself holding my breath with them.\r\n\r\nOne thing Apollo 13 has no shortage of is melodrama. Much of it is very touching, such as Hanks' character fantasizing about walking on the moon (something he soon learns that he will never do). What makes the movie so emotional is the thought that they will never return home. I was more sad in the middle of the film than I was when it was finished.\r\n\r\nAlthough I liked this film on many levels, it wasn't absolutely amazing. The special effects were no better than that of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). It's not that Apollo 13 had an uninteresting story, it's just that it was not enough to sustain suspense and emotion for over two hours. So yes, I was a little bored at times.\r\n\r\nOverall, I thought it was a solid film. Sometimes it was cheesy and sweet, other times it was a nail-biting thriller. It's thoroughly enjoyable.",

The entire cast is what makes this movie work. \r\n\r\nThe special effects are done well, especially since none of the special effects were done with a computer. \r\n\r\nThe cast is unbelievable in this movie.

            "content": "A downfall to creating a film based off of well known true events is that the conclusion is spoiled, therefore, leaving little in the conclusion that is unexpected.  Therefore, these kinds of films tend to rely more on the journey to provide the emotional umph, then the actual conclusion.  When the film is made to be suspenseful, this doesn't always work so well.  Films like Valkyrie shows us how this can fail.  Films like Apollo 13 shows us how it can work.\n\nThree astronauts, named Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise, find themselves in a dangerous predicament when after blasting off into space, begin having extreme rocket malfunctions.  Problem after problem occurs, and things are seeming really, really bleak.  With just about everything going wrong, it's a frantic survival tale, where the three men are desperately fighting for their lives.\n\nDespite being based off of well known true events, Apollo 13 still provides a suspenseful ride.  Though the first half-hour or so is a bit slow, the pace quickly picks up quite a bit, and the film rarely feels long after that.  This is quite an accomplishment for a film that's nearly 2 and a half hours long.\n\nDespite being a highly suspenseful and exciting film, Apollo 13 is not what one might consider a \"joy ride.\"  The emotional aspect of the film keeps us in pain and sadness for the families waiting to hear whether their husbands and fathers will return from space alive.  And of course, worrying families aren't comforted by exaggerating media that are squeezing every last drop of suspense out of the already emotionally taxing situation.  By playing a more stressful and tragic game with the family's involvement, Apollo 13 becomes a more intelligent and thoughtful film than it might've been otherwise.\n\nThe families aren't the only stressful aspect the film plays from.  Back at Mission Control, the entire staff is frantically trying to find a way to guide the astronauts back home.  Going with little sleep and lots of coffee, each small victory is a reason for celebration, though there are no rests until the men are safely back.\n\nSolid acting further assists this.  Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton, as Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise respectively are very good in their roles, as is Ed Harris as the Apollo 13 Flight Director, Gene Kranz.  The standout here, however, is Jim's wife, Marilyn, played by Kathleen Quinlan.  She portrays a distraught and pained wife in a performance that we truly believe.  There's some deceptive depth in this role, and Quinlan nails it.\n\nThe visuals are quite nice.  While not particularly breathtaking, the effects look good, and they look real.  The zero gravity effects specifically are very good.  It's certainly a breath of fresh air from the often excessive CGI effects in film today. \n\nThe score, by James Horner, is good, but it's an interesting approach to the film.  While one might expect a film in space to have a much more grand score, James Horner composes a less loud and brassy score.  While there are moments of triumph in the music, they come less often then one might have expected.  Also, in moments of high tension (and there are several), Horner takes another interesting approach to the music.  Rather than composing pieces at higher tempos, these pieces are usually played at a slower speed, letting the onscreen action carry most of the tension.  Whether this is a plus or a minus is up to your own tastes.\n\nApollo 13 is a well made and well acted film.  Told with suspense and precision, this is a fine example of true event films done right.  Still, while there's not much here in the way of flaws (though some might argue that it's a bit repetitive), Apollo 13 also just misses being a truly great film.  It's certainly an enjoyable one, and making a 2 hour film endurable is an achievement in itself, but I couldn't help but wonder while I was watching Apollo 13, why I wasn't loving it.  The funny thing is now that I've seen the film, I still couldn't tell you.",

Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) are the team of astronauts who are scheduled to fly to the moon as part of the Apollo 13 mission. But Mattingly is ruled out, on account of him being sick. They instead bring in Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) as the third member of their team. They blast off.\n\nAnd this movie is just getting started.\n\nNot much can be said about the masterpiece that is Apollo 13, because words won't be able to do it justice. It's that good. Hanks, Bacon, and Paxton put forth some of the best performances ever, and Sinise and Ed Harris as the mission control leader don't do a bad job, either. \n\nThe movie does such a great job of authenticity, which is the best thing I can say to explain why it's so good. We feel like this is perfectly legit, like this is exactly what happened, word for word. It seems plausible to us. Unlike the recently released Apollo 11, which was totally unrealistic and not well done, Apollo 13 seems like it could have been footage taken from the space shuttle by Lovell, Haise, and Swigert themselves.\n\nBottom Line: This mission was made possible using technology that can be found in today's iPhones. So why are we not flying to the moon everdyday nowadays? Because people aren't interested, it's become too routine. But Apollo 13, this flawless masterpiece, makes us look back on the idea and care about it",

So now that they're in space and they have landed on the moon, an onboard explosion causes the power systems to go downhill and the oxygen begins to dwindle. It's up to the workers at NASA back at Earth to send oxygen back up there and rescue the three astronauts in order to get them back to Earth safely before anything else goes wrong. I'm one of those guys who find movies about astrology very interesting and this was no exception. If you watch the scenes in the film when they're in space, you can easily soak up the drama alone. The performances from our lead actors are amazingly believable, The story is solidly written and directed and I think most of all, it is the drama that soaks up the whole movie itself making this visual media pretty epic. This is a professional astrology movie where no cheesiness, goofiness, silliness nor stupidness is allowed. Apollo 13 just got a 10/10.",

There are several hitches in preparation but the takeoff is smooth, beginning a supposedly routine mission.

They make difficult decisions and Lovell keeps them level-headed while Houston scrambles to problem solve and bring them home.

It does not only stands out as one of the most produced drama in years, but with such a cast (Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise and Ed Harris) taken into such an intense plot, it's almost impossible not to fall in love with this movie in first sight. To begin, it has a really big name in direction, although barely recognised. Ron Howard is hated and praised, but in the film industry he is definately between Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorseses. In other words between the bosses. The first movie I saw from this man was The Grinch, the Jim Carrey version, another classic as this movie, only that they are absolutely different, of course. But something you can notist from Ron Howard, and you can see it in movies like Frost/Nixon or the Da Vinci saga, is that he really knows how to keep the tension. But of cours, 2 hours and 20 minutes are a lot of seconds to fill up with nail-bitting moments. Without violence but limited to problematic situations, this movie is interesting but gets heavy after some times. But the cast, amazing by the way, do their best to keep you in the movie, although is inevitable loosing some interest as it's a true story. Indeed, Apollo 13 is one of the best movies ever made because of its simplicity. It's a drama with no cheap shots, a thriller with no KA-BOOMS but almost a realistic experience of a trip to space, despite troubled, and how it was when americans still went to the moon. This, proud to say, it's a real space movie. Armageddon, meh, maybe too sticky. Apollo 18, yes, that space Paranormal Activity, is some crap to recycle. This movie however, is a clean, pure space movie as it should be. And even though its said to be a documentary (And it can perfectly fit as one) for me Apollo 13 is only awesome because it had some really tiny flaws that can barely be noticed on the splendour it gives away.",

The ENTIRE Saturn V launch sequence is created from scratch! You can see shots that are familiar to you (ie. the close-up of the boosters igniting and sucking in of the exhaust flames), as well as some incredible shots that would have been impossible during an actual launch (ie. what would it have been like if you could have a helicopter shot above the Saturn 5 as it rocketed passed you?). Every single shot was created by the Ron Howard's special effects team. The launch sequence is so good that Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin asked Ron Howard from what vault did he acquire what he thought was stock footage.\n\nWhat the viewer has to realize is that even though the plot turns play out like a typical Hollywood film, these events REALLY happened (including the panned scene where Marilyn Lovell's ring falls into the shower drain).

Ron Howard made a modern masterpiece here.  \r\n\r\nFor those that don't know, this was a fairly accurate retelling of the events that occured during the Apollo 13 crisis.  It uses a combination of real news footage with excellent reeanctment to give you a real positive feeling of pride in the space program as it was in the early 70's.  Seeing the level of time management and problem solving that went into bringing those 3 guys home was wonderful to see.  \r\n\r\nI still get choked up during the final blackout scene.  the combination of intense drama, beautiful musical score and wonderful visual effects leaves you on the edge of your seat.  For people that never lived through the event, this film helps give a human feeling to those people that dared to be great in the name of human exploration.  A must see for all ages.",

I think the crowning achievement of the movie, though, is making the audience feel the suspense and fear that the crew members of Apollo 13 felt even though we all know the ultimate outcome, and I think the director is to thank for that. All in all, I believe Apollo 13 is a piece of masterful film making that everyone deserves to see; I had been previously hesitant to watch it because I thought it might be boring, but after seeing it in its entirety, I can easily say it is one of the most thoroughly engaging and exciting films of the 90s, and an instant classic to boot.",

            "content": "I don't know much about politics or budget restraints, but if the work that NASA does can produce films like ``Apollo 13'' and its predecessor, ``The Right Stuff'', I'm all for keeping it around. The tenuous blend of technology and human spirit that these films celebrate is the closest thing to a man-made miracle that we have.\n``Apollo 13'' is a great achievement. Not only does it capture the look and feel of the early seventies- it educates and illustrates the accomplishment that the early Apollo missions were. Ron Howard's direction is near perfect; focusing and complimenting the natural drama of the events. So powerful is the contents of the story, that the subtlety of the direction can easily be overlooked, but given the scope of the film and the infinite number of directions that it could have taken, it's easy to see that Howard knew exactly what he wanted to concentrate on and how to best cover it.\nAs the name implies, the film covers the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission that launched on the 11th of April in 1970. Slated to go to the moon, the ship and its crew ran into serious trouble when an explosion occurred on the third day of the journey.\nThe film starts by reviewing a brief history of the Apollo program, from its inception through its set-backs right up to its seemingly routine nature at the time of the Odyssey mission. Far from dull, this background gets us into the mood of the late sixties, reminds us of the virtual new-ness of the space flight activity. Space shuttles take off routinely these days with little hoopla. We take it for granted. Undoubtedly too much so. By the time of the Apollo 13 mission ( a mere three years after man first set foot on the moon), the American public had already grown nonchalant about space travel. Yet the technology was definitely far from perfected.\nOne scene that elicits chuckles is a VIP tour that astronaut Jim Lovell is conducting for some Washington bureaucrats debating the value of continuing to fund an expensive space program. Talking of the great strides that have been made, Lovell attempts to impress them with a description of a computer system responsible for complex operations of the program that barely fills the space of an ordinary room.\nLooking back, it's hard to imagine that most of the public was still watching their favorite television programs on black and white sets. It's a poignant moment when the major networks (there were only three, if you recall) opt to ignore the astronauts live broadcast from space in favor of regular, rating-boosting sitcoms and programming. The apathy seems staggering as the crew continues its television feed, unaware of the last minute change.\nFrom the start, the mission appears plagued. A medical decision prompts a change in the crew two days prior to the launch. The intimacy that has developed amongst the members over the months of training is upset with the replacement by the back-up pilot. When the explosion occurs it robs the crew of its chance to land on the moon. Soon, the issue becomes ``Will the crew be able to get home?''. The odds are against it.\nThe command module has lost power and precious oxygen. The crew is forced to take haven in the lunar module. Designed to accommodate two for approximately 45 hours worth of work, it is forced to house all three of the men. This creates its own set of problems. In order to have sufficient power to enable a re-entry, the ship is forced to shut down all its systems. Soon, the capsule is near freezing. Next, the air purification system- designed to serve two- is unable to cleanse the CO2 from the air. Without a quick solution, the men will be incapacitated.\nThe amazing thing behind the entire story is that in spite of the hours of training, the millions of details and the myriad considerations of the mission planners, this accident made all of the preparations completely void. None of the problems or complications that the mission encountered had been anticipated. Even the make-shift solutions forced upon the men came accompanied with new sets of problems. Both the men in space and the support team on the ground were working from scratch; improvising from the materials on hand, fighting against the impossibility of the situation and the unbending restrictions of time. There was no allowance for error, no second chance.\n``Apollo 13'' stars Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris and Gary Sinise. The performances are good and certainly believable, but even so, the familiarity of the faces (especially Hanks') detracts slightly from the real-life knowledge of the scenario. Try as I might, it was hard not to see Tom up on the screen instead of astronaut Jim Lovell.\nWith some mild swearing of frustration, the film is rated PG-13. Though the rating will allow for younger children, the pacing and length of the film (2 1/2 hours) will make it difficult for all but the most space-happy youngsters to sit still for the duration. Be forewarned- Adults won't want to miss a minute of this exceptional film in dealing with fussy children.",

Factually accurate for the most part it avoids an overload of sentimentality and focuses on the crisis at hand... Three astronauts stranded in space with barely any hope of getting home. This story is told really well with 3 views of the unfolding incident, they being the astronauts point of view, mission control and their families'. There isn't really any stand-out performances here but rather a single solid collaboration of actors. Watching Apollo 13 also lead to other questions about life in the 60s and 70s such as fashion, technology and rampant smoking habits (lol). I didn't realise it was a gate-way film... LOL. I love this movie and we might even keep up the interest with the consequent HBO series From Earth To The Moon (produced by Howard & Hanks). Good stuff.",

            "content": "Although I had watched it many times before, as it was an excellent depiction of the historical event, Apollo 13 was a film I was eager to see once again.\n\nWhile the impact of Apollo 13 decreases the more you've seen it, the general spirit of the film is all there regardless.\nThe two central themes in Apollo 13 seems to be the unprecedented disaster of space travel on the Apollo 13 mission and the patriotic heroism put into the mission by everyone determined to bring the astronauts back to earth safely. There is a lot of talking that goes on throughout the film's 140 minute running time and a slow pace too which may faze some, but it is truly a powerfully realistic film which captures the excellent visual spectacle of a space mission and the humane drama of the disaster that occurred.\nApollo 13 is an interesting change of form for director Ron Howard. The former actor from Happy Days has come such a long way since then and has directed films of very many genres, and Apollo 13 depicts him stepping into a scientific biographical story. The intense accuracy he puts into the story is incredible, both visually and in terms of how he handles the script.  His role as director is just perfect because he is able to give the film an atmosphere which is brilliantly intense and touching. But what he does visually is way more impressive. \nApollo 13 is loaded with extensive imagery. The scenery for the film is flawlessly convincing in how it sets up the film from the start, and then from there it just gets better. Once the Apollo 13 mission takes off, viewers get a sight for the incredible visual effects of the film. Everything depicting the space launch is done in extensive detail, and then from there is a plenty of strong scenes which depict the space voyage. The journey is a thoroughly convincing one which looks great and is captured with stellar atmospheric cinematography and edited at a steady pace. The sound effects are also powerfully realistic and edited into the audio plane at a good steady pace. The costumes for the characters are also great, so everything in Apollo 13 is captured with fine visual detail.\nWilliam Broyles, Jr. and Al Reinert give the film a really good basis with its script because the dialogue in the film gives a lot for the actors to work with, and it in general uses a lot of historical accuracy to note many of the major and minor technical aspects of the mission. It is explained in a way that viewers are able to understand without degrading it from the sophistication of the real scientific language behind it all which makes the film a learning experience as well.\nAnd as a means of ensuring that Apollo 13 succeeds on a human level, the large cast all manage to deliver truly stellar performances.\nTom Hanks is easily a great casting choice for the lead role. His natural dramatic charisma and general charm make him a good lead in any film, and Apollo 13 is of course no exception. He commands the Apollo 13 ship with ease because he has the spirit of the leader and the ability to interact with the other cast members excellently, whether it be in direct contact with Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon or across a satellite speaker with the flight crew down on earth. Tom Hanks makes a great lead in Apollo 13 due to his natural patriotic heroism, and he leads the mission with gusto.\nKevin Bacon makes a powerful part in the film as well. You can tell that he gets the character deeply because he always has a sense of inner torment, largely based on his character's regret for undergoing the command which compromised the Apollo 13 mission. He adds that his character's determination to truly prove himself as an astronaut. His character's presence is dramatized well with underlying subtext being all there, and Kevin Bacon steps into the role with easy acting talent. You can really expect no less of him, his performance in Apollo 13 is just plain solid.\nBill Paxton always keeps himself tied into the atmosphere in Apollo 13. As the themes of the film become more intense, Bill Paxton works incredibly hard to ensure that the harsh reality of the environment in the Apollo 13 spacecraft is conveyed. He floats around at a fast speed while he delivers his lines with a true sense of fear which can only come from real emotion. Bill Paxton goes into the role and never lets up in a performance which is tense and emotionally strong, so he makes a welcome addition to the Apollo 13 flight crew.\nEd Harris is in top form again. He is one actor who has never let me down in a single film because what he brings to his roles are always impressive. In the case of Apollo 13, Ed Harris works to convey the heroism behind the people working down on earth to ensure the safe return of the Apollo 13. Every actor does their part, but none of them command the role as well as Ed Harris does. He fits the profile because he looks the part perfectly and his intense line delivery is just incredible. Ed Harris is 100% convincing in his role as Flight Director Gene Kranz because he flawlessly delivers every line with a sense that he genuinely understands every word of what he is saying, and so he brings an all new level of realism to the film during his scenes.\nGary Sinise delivers a fine supporting effort. It is easy to sympathise for him because his character Ken Mattingly missed out on a chance to participate in the flight through space which puts him into a melancholic state, only for him to be drastically brought back in as part of an emergency to save the crew on the ship. He is terrific in the part simply because he has a subtle sense of stoic sadness in him which is realistic without being melodramatic, and so his role shows him keeping his emotions in tact very well. Gary Sinise is really a welcome presence in Apollo 13, and it is terrific seeing him working alongside Tom Hanks once again.\nThe supporting performance of Clint Howard is also great. The actor has made an appearance in 17 of his brother Ron Howard's films to date, but he has never given it a finer performance than his role in Apollo 13. His role is small but pivotal, and he does a fine job in the role.\nKathleen Quinlan is also good. While her role in the story is mainly for its dramatization, she makes a sympathetic effort in the role which turns out effective.\n\nSo Apollo 13 is a slowly paced but excellently realistic depiction of the unforgettable historical mission which is well acted, technically excellent and acted with a large cast of great talent.",

The characters are cardboard, the music -- and in fact the entire mood -- is reverential to the point of nausea. Like all Howard's films, it's manipulative in a golly and gosh way, in a pat, slick,package.\n\nThe dialogue is all bluntly about the mission, with none of the indirect details that flesh out a good story and give the characters three-dimensions. \n\nThe actors are all good actors, but they act too much, in a stock, predigested way. There's no searching for the particular truth of the moment. Howard can direct a film, but he doesn't require his actors to discard their learned tricks and look deeper into themselves.\n\nThere's more drama and tension in listening to recordings of the actual flight, the almost bland, military precision of real people on the edge of survival, unrehearsed, as it is actually happening.\n\nI gave it three stars for its production values -- although given its big budget, this is the minimum to be expected from Hollywood these days. And then deducted a star for (1) the music, which was either hyper-emotional or cloying, and almost always intrusive, and (2) its absolutely false use of the sound of rocket engines in outer space -- where, of course, there is no air and therefore no sound. This last was inexcusable in a film that pretends to authenticity.",

Some of the most intense lines are real dialogue recorded on the intercom from Houston to the Aquarius. It's shot beautifully, as most Ron Howard films are, and you get a good sense of how cold, dank, and alone the astronauts must have felt adrift in the cosmos. The music is a big part of what stirs your emotions throughout, especially during the re-entry sequence. \r\n\r\nFor my money, the best performance in the movie is Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, the flight director for the mission. His determination to bring the men home alive inspires even the people who were sure it was a lost cause. I love, love, love this movie.",

            "content": "[b][u]Review My Collection #17[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nIf there's one certainly in the world of cinema, it's that we love going to space.  A place few of us will see in our lifetime, film gives us a window to a mysterious world where gravity fails, stars shine bright and, no matter how hard you try, nobody can hear you scream.  Every imaginable genre has taken trips to the great beyond.  From Georges Méliès groundbreaking A Trip to the Moon to the surrealistic nightmare of 2001, filmmakers have been fascinated with the skies above since the beginning of the art form.  Hell, even Abbot and Costello went to Mars.  \r\n\r\nProblem was that space had always been situated in the realm of science fiction.  Fantasy tales of thunderous rockets, starship battles and grotesque aliens, nobody ever bothered to simply get it right.  Depict space travel as it really was for the brave men and women who stepped into a tiny capsule strapped to 800,000 pounds of rocket fuel and blasted into the heavens.  Not quite Wile E Coyote strapped to an Acme rocket, but close.  Luckily for us, director Ron Howard and star Tom Hanks had that a singular vision to bring the real life drama of space travel to the screen.  The result was 1995's Apollo 13, an emotionally stirring story of tragedy and triumph wrapped in the real life drama of a doomed NASA mission.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw this film in the late nineties, I had no clue of the real Apollo 13 mission.  My dad brought the VHS home one day, we popped it in and I was blown away.  The story tracks the strange set of circumstances that took the voyage of Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and turned it into a fight for survival.  Not satisfied with simply tracking the mission, the movie also tells the story of Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), the astronaut left behind, the mission's gruff flight director, Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and Jim's wife (Kathleen Quinlan). The movie boasts an extraordinary accuracy in not only how they deal with the science, how they handle the relationships between the different players.  Simply put, the film feels real from performance to blast off.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks stars as the captain of the doomed vessel and you can tell he loves every minute of his portrayal.  A self-professed space nut to begin with, Hanks hurls himself into the role with surprising restraint, getting every beat of the eagle eyed captain down to a tee.  Harris is also noteworthy in the role of the flight director, giving a grounded and restrained performance.  The film also boasts the most accurate depictions of the science of space travel ever put to film.  From the inside of Mission Control, to the interiors of the spacecraft to the launch itself, Apollo 13 set a standard for space realism, a benchmark no film has exceeded since.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is treated with the same attention to detail, sometimes to the detriment of the film.  Side stories like Jim's wife losing her ring in the shower or the networks not running the crew's TV broadcast may come off as emotionally leading but actually took place in the real life events.  These scenes may come off cheesy to the viewer but they never dull the impact of the events that took place.  Viewers who are unaware of the actual story may find the suspense artificially enhanced but the effect is downright riveting.  Every element of the movie, from the sound design to the score, are all perfectly pitched to heighten the drama and creating genuine suspense.\r\n\r\nAs I said in the outset of this review, if space movies are a dime a dozen, Apollo 13 is the statistical outlier.  While it may not have any standout performances, the film is a well-mixed combination of acting and directing.  Standing on the bedrock of historical accuracy and providing more than enough suspense, Apollo 13 is an entertaining docudrama that holds up even today.  Suffice to say, when NASA astronauts not only approve the production but use scenes from the film for historical purposes, you know you got it right.  A fine film in nearly every regard.\r\n\r\n[url=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/808326/blogs/?id=701434\"]**Check out my RT blog entitled \"Review My Collection\" for the rest of the series!!**[/url]",

Ed Harris was excellent as the flight director as was Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly. Great pacing by Ron Howard and one of the best films made about the space program.",

My first reactions were absolute amazement and real shock-and-awe to this huge space landscape that they had created for the movie. It doesn't take us very long to fall in love with the way the movie was made, directed, written or shot. \nI would have to group this movie with the timeless classics category of movies made in and around the 90s. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that this movie deserved every bit of the high ratings and huge favor that it has received. \n\nBottom line; When it's on TNT make sure you watch it! No doubt it is worth the time.\n4.5 out of 5!",

We are always convinced that he was going to be sure that the NASA flight crew would leave no stone unturned when trying to find a solution that will only result in getting our astronauts home.  \"Dammit, I don't want another estimate!

That's not limited to just the actual astronauts: the NASA crew on Earth, as well as the families of the astronauts, all have a good amount of screentime, and all three of these points-of-view are well developed for the most part. The astronaut crew is obviously the most developed, and the family is probably the least developed, but the focus on the characters is admirable to say the least. Tom Hanks is as great as ever, and Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Ed Harris all do well alongside him. It's not just a character-driven movie though: seeing as the film deals with space travel, it comes with visual spectacle that is absolutely stunning.

It's entertaining, well written, well acted, and just an awesome film in general. Ron Howard really shows us a great film, filled with everything we could ask for, with the side effect of a few minor flaws here and there. Ever since then, plenty of space films tried to copy it's formula, but none of them had the substance and charisma that this film has. It makes the film feel not as \"Based on a True Story\" but as if you're actually ON Apollo 13 with these characters, feeling the suspense all the way. It's just very memorable and very cool. The story is basically a recreation of the Apollo 13 moon mission, which ended up failing because of technical error. It really doesn't lead to any surprises or uncertainty, but those don't seem as necessarily as, for the most part, this is a calm film, no real action or scares, just some suspense. The characters were... pretty good. The main character, Jim Lovell, played by Tom Hanks, is a great character, and so is his wife, but the two other pilots, although likable, are not focused on much. It's not THAT big a problem, as it's intentions was to follow the main character, the other 2 characters, although also likable, aren't the main focus. However, it would be nice to know more about the other 2 characters, but we do learn a bit about their personalities during the actual mission. The acting was also good. Tom Hanks was not really disguising himself as anyone, he wasn't Forrest Gump or Woody, he was pretty much just being himself, and I actually respect him for that, as he did do a good job in this film. Also, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Kathleen Quinlan all did great. Now, usually I don't discuss this in great detail, but I feel I must talk about the special effects, and in my opinion, they were very well done. Sure, some parts, it was completely obvious the special effects were CGI, but for most of the movie, they looked really cool, almost like they were really there. They aren't the best special effects ever, but for the time, they must have looked OUTSTANDING. Now, for my favorite part of the review, \"The Best and Worst of Apollo 13\". The best part of this movie... Even though I'm tempted to say the cinematography, I'll have to say the atmosphere. Why you ask? Well, let me give an example: When the 3 characters are escaping the earths atmosphere and rocketing into space, you FEEL as if the characters are actually blasting into space, it makes the film seem more like an experience than just a film. The worst thing about this film is probably the other two main characters. Like I said, they're likable and all, but most of the focus seems to be on Hanks, which is OK, but in the end, you barely felt like you got to know the other two, so that got me a little angry, but to tell you the truth, the rest of the movie was pretty awesome. I really enjoyed it for the execution of the story, the effects, and of course, the experience itself. Also, in my opinion, this is one of the best disaster films of all time, even surpassing Titanic! So overall, this is an excellent film, well worthy of a watch. 5/5.",

            "content": "My consensus on Apollo 13 is really easy to confirm; it was great. It was near amazing, and nothing close to  bad, it was just great. It had problems here and there, and it could've been more of a story, but simply, it's not that bad. The amazing thing is that this all in the film really happened, and none of it was fake. It surprises you at every turn, with scary events, and you highly doubt this happened on the real mission, but when you research the Apollo 13 flight, the movie follows exactly the facts. And that is why I'm giving this film a 70%.\r\n   \r\nI'm not really gonna get into the plot of this whole film, for it just really follows the adventure of astronauts who head off into a mission to the moon, and not all really goes as planned.\r\n   \r\nThe acting within this film was brilliant. With Tom Hanks as the lead actor, Ed Harris as a supporting actor, and Kevin Bacon as another supporting actor, no one should be surprised at the amazing capabilities this team brought to the screen. Personally, my favorite actor was Kevin Bacon. He brought to his character a kind of personality no other one had. He was at the same time fearful, but yet determined to keep his fear contained and prove to the rest of the team that he had potential within this mission. Tom Hanks played his role surprisingly well, for I wouldn't have ever expected him to play a part such as this. I liked the leadership and courage he brought to his character, but he's Tom Hanks, so it really wasn't anything new for him. Ed Harris brought a nice touch to the film, a kind of energetic feel. Not sure if he should've been nominated for his Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor, but I really didn't pay much attention to him at times he might've done his best acting, so I'm simply not sure. Overall, though, acting was brilliant.\r\n   \r\nThe editing and cinematography were one for the books. The scenes they shot at times on Earth were as good as the scenes they shot in space. I liked this certain aspect of the film for the fact that most sci-fi space films heavily place their best cinematography in space, but in this film they had great cinematography throughout, and I really enjoyed that. The lighting was also nice, for it was accurate with space lighting, which some sci-fi movies don't usually seem to get right.\r\n   \r\nThe score for this film was truly American and inspiring. It is ranked as a top 15 favorite of mine. The work of the violins and the drums during this score were some of the best I've ever heard in a film. The vocalization pieces were the best I've ever heard in a sci-fi film, and this is best sci-fi score I've heard since Star Wars. I advise everyone to check it out on YouTube.\r\n   \r\nBut there were a couple of things in the film that bothered me. 1) To most people, this film seemed to be a thriller. While it was nail-biting at a few parts, I couldn't really consider this to be one a thriller. It wasn't fast paced enough, and the suspense at times wasn't built up as high as it should've been to make the film seem thrilling (although I do have to give credit to a part in this film in which I held my breath for quite a long time). 2) Already knew the ending. The thing with historical adventures, and especially films such as space missions, is that most people know how things end up. Meaning, I already knew what happened to the Apollo 13 even before I heard about this film, and when watching this movie, the conclusion was already in my head. I can't blame anyone about this, but I'm pretty sure for people like me, who already knew how things were gonna go, they really just couldn't enjoy the film as much. And 3) there were a lot of unnecessary scenes. If you guys have read my reviews, then you guys know I HATE scenes that don't get the film anywhere. If a car stops on a road in a movie, and all the character does is cuss once saying something like \"D*mn it\", then that is an unnecessary scene. And there were plenty of them in this film. Who needs to see kinds of scenes with NO character development, NO commencing with the plot, NO humor, NO drama, NO suspense etc. and all we get is a stupid 10 second scene just wasting film time and MY time? Apollo 13 really irritated me with that.\r\n  \r\n All in all, though, I have to say Apollo 13 was a nice win for me. The flaws I stated were really the only downside, but the movie proved to be really emotionally touching and exciting and I plan on watching it again soon. I want everyone to check it out if they're in a mood for a historical drama, and please, if you still don't understand why I gave this film 70%, please visit this link below:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/935623/blogs/?id=703501\r\n\r\nThanks!",

            "content": "Throughout his career, Ron Howard has always been somewhat underestimated as a director. His background on Happy Days and his love of sentimental storylines have led many people to brand him as 'Spielberg-lite', trying to pack the same emotional punches of his more famous colleague but without having the same level of imagination to pull it off. While Howard has made a number of big mis-steps in his career (The Da Vinci Code being one of the most egregious), his filmography as a whole suggests a man of many talents and interests who has never quite got the credit that he deserves.\n\nMore than any other film in his back catalogue, Apollo 13 is the film which should silence doubters about Howard's credibility as a director. It pulls off a really difficult trick, namely taking a story whose famous characteristic is its ending and making it tense and dramatic both for people who know the story backwards and those coming to it the very first time. Howard's direction is top-notch and his attention to detail in both the script and the visuals has ensured that the film still holds together after 23 years. It remains the gold standard for space-set dramas, and may even be Howard's best work behind the camera.\n\nOne of the big issues which all period dramas have to deal with is capturing the period setting in a believable way. You can't just put a character in a miniskirt with The Beatles in the background and expect us to believe that it's the 1960s; instead, you have to focus on the little details, giving the audience enough clues to trust that the setting is accurate without the film becoming solely about fashions and popular culture. This is particularly difficult when you're dealing with an important historical event with plentiful archive footage or old news reports available. The temptation is to just plaster Walter Cronkite and his ilk all over the screen whenever an exposition dump is needed, but as George Clooney found on Good Night and Good Luck (with the footage of Joseph McCarthy), this can jar with an audience - too much realism can actually take them out of the action.\n\nApollo 13 is one of the few Hollywood films (at least in this period) which manages to pull this off. Much of the old footage which is used generally repeats information we already known in a slightly different way, but it is well-integrated through its timing and positioning in the plot. Rather than being shoved in front of an old TV screen and sitting through a few seconds of Dick Cavett, these clips are only rolled out once we feel invested in the characters, and feel like we are watching alongside them. The other period touches - including the cars and the costumes - all feel well-researched but don't draw attention to themselves, and even the most distinctive elements (like Ed Harris' white waistcoat) are handled very diligently.\n\nIn approaching its subject matter, Apollo 13 is less of a Hollywood blockbuster and more of a high-tech cousin of All The President's Men. Like Alan J. Pakula on that film, Howard is starting on the basis that the audience already knows something about the outcome of the real-life event - respectively the resignation of Richard Nixon and all three Apollo 13 astronauts making it back to Earth. And like Pakula, he flatters the audience, letting them figure things out in the build-up to the main event. They walk into the film invested on an intellectual level, and come out with an emotional bond as well as having learned more about an interesting subject.\n\nWhere All The President's Men created tension through conflicting information and the political pressure being put on Woodward and Bernstein, Apollo 13 plants small seeds of doubt about the mission in the audience's mind. Some of these seeds are played for laughs, with the astronauts joking about taking a pig into space to combat the bad luck of the number 13. But other scenes are equally effective at making us feel uneasy about the fortunes of Jim Lovell and his crew. Individually, Marilyn losing her wedding ring in the shower or Ken Mattingly getting the measles wouldn't be enough to get us worried - we might write them off entirely, or at least dismiss them as not too significant. But Howard structures these moments as milestones on the countdown to disaster; because we don't pick up on everything the first time round, the pay-off still comes as a surprise. \n\nThis slow, ominous build-up is complimented by the way in which the astronauts' mission is contextualised. Where a more histrionic film would have built this up as 'the most important moon mission since Apollo 11' or other such nonsense, Howard is keen to point out the public's waning interest in the US space programme in 1970. This is all done with subtle hints, whether it's Marilyn mentioning she might not come to the launch, her daughter being more bothered about The Beatles breaking up, or the TV stations not showing Lovell's broadcast live (in an exchange reminiscent of the ratings speech in Capricorn One). The films taps into the idea that people only care about things when they go horribly wrong - a view which seems all the more biting in today's car-crash celebrity culture.\n\nThe scenes in space are masterful on three levels. Firstly, they are a mechanical marvel - before Gravity came along, this vied with 2001: A Space Odyssey as the most realistic depiction of weightlessness in cinema. By recreating weightlessness through hundreds of parabola flights, shooting just 30 seconds at a time, Howard gives Tom Hanks et al the chance to relax into their roles which they wouldn't get from being winched around in harnesses or jumping around against green-screen. His choice of camera angles is superb: because shooting could take place on any angle and would drift around at will, we feel like an active, curious observer, allowing things to unfold more naturally than if we were rooted to the spot.  Throw in the excellent special effects and cinematography by John Carpenter's long-time collaborator Dean Cundey, and you have one smashing shot after another.\n\nSecondly, Apollo 13 is an argument for being able to maintain tension without losing accuracy, and vice versa. Screenwriters William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert stuck as closely to the mission transcripts as possible - something which adds realism without the film ever becoming tedious. A few creative liberties are taken, including the film's most famous line - Jim Lovell actually said: \"Houston, we've had a problem\". But it never feels like the film is labouring to be accurate merely out of any sense of duty to NASA purists. Howard is determined to get things as right as possible, while maintaining a lightness of touch and a populist approach so that we always understand and care about what is happening, even when the jargon starts flowing.\n\nThirdly, the scenes in space see Howard and the script stretching their narrative muscles a little. In amidst all the procedural dialogue and the individual races against time, we get a number of touching fantasy sequences which use outer space to focus on inner space, as all proper science fiction should. In one such sequence, Tom Hanks imagines himself walking on the moon; in a scene reminiscent of The Ninth Configuration, Howard contrasts the silent awe of the moon's surface with the quiet despair on Lovell's face from inside the lunar module. It's a beautiful moment which expresses Howard's confidence in himself, the material and the actors who are bringing it to life.\n\nThe performances in Apollo 13 are excellent across the board. Following back-to-back Oscars for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks continues to embody the likeable American everyman even in the most extraordinary of circumstances. He is totally believable as Jim Lovell, and is complimented beautifully by his co-stars Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon, who both give the best performances of their respective careers. On the ground Ed Harris remains eternally underrated as flight director Gene Kranz, and there is a very fine supporting performance by Gary Sinise, who would collaborate with Hanks again on The Green Mile.\n\nThe only real mis-steps in Apollo 13 are those which pander to Hollywood's expectations, either in the stakes of the mission or attempts to lighten the mood. The scene with the grandmother and the Apollo 11 astronauts feels forced and over-played, though it is at least brief enough not to throw us out of the picture. More problematic is the argument between Bacon and Paxton's characters - something which didn't happen in real life and which comes across as manufactured. There is enough tension in these scenes without adding more into the mix, and while the film does get over it quickly, it could have just as easily been cut without harming anything.\n\nApollo 13 is a great docudrama which remains a standard to which all future historical dramas should aspire. Howard directs with confidence and aplomb to wring out all the tension he can without it feeling contrived, bolstered by a very fine script, great performances from his three leading men and visuals which are both technically superb and deeply involving. It is a very hard film to dislike and a hard act to follow for all involved.",

            "content": "Personal Score: 10/10\r\n\r\nMuch like Titanic, if you know your history then you already knew how this movie was gonna turn out.  So one may think going in that simply knowing the outcome makes the film somewhat anti-climactic, but I'm glad to say that this is simply not the case.  Ron Howard does a fantastic job directing one of his finest films, and the tension he builds from start to finish is absolutely amazing.\r\nApollo 13 is about astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert and their near fatal mission to the moon, but the film also focuses on the effect this has on the people back on Earth.  \r\nAfter an explosion causes the ship to rapidly lose power, mission control in Houston has to devise a way to keep the 3 men alive long enough for re-entry and hope they survive it, as well as several days on a cold ship with limited resources.  Much skill and improvisation is required in this task, and the way we watch how taxing it is on the men below is riveting.  This is especially true with Ed Harris' character, Gene Krantz.  I have to say that despite acting alongside talents like Tom Hanks, Gary Senise, Bill Paxton, and many others, I believe Harris' performance to be the best of the film.  His unforgettable line \"We've never lost an American in space.  We're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch.  Failure is not an option!\" is filled with such determination and desperation, and it really is a great example of how he plays the role.  His reaction at the end is that he is overwhelmed, and one can't help but feel it for him too.\r\nThe film also focuses on the families at home, waiting, praying and hoping that their men come back alive.  Kathleen Quinlan does an excellent job as Jim Lovell's wife, and her determination to hope against the odds is well played.\r\nA film like this wouldn't work well unless the payoff at the end was good.  Like I mentioned before, anyone who knows the history of the flight knows the men returned home safely, but how well this moment was filmed would be crucial to its overall impact.  Thankfully, it isn't just good, it's perfect.  Howard keeps us waiting and waiting, watching as the hope begins to drain from the faces of those who love and/or care for the men.  But then the image of the heat shield falling and the parachutes opening makes our hearts leap, until those wonderful words \"Hello, Houston.  This is Odyssey.  It's good to see you again.\" sound out and emotions erupt with joy.  The scene is beautiful, and it brings me to tears every single time I watch it.\r\nIf you haven't seen this film yet, I urge you to do so.  It is a masterful tale of perserverance despite enormous obstacles, and one of the most emotionally satisfying films I've had the pleasure to see.  Wonderfully filmed and wonderfully acted, Apollo 13 is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "When I was younger,I was looking through all the VHS tapes I had.One of them was Apollo 13,and I decided to watch it.I,much to my surprise,enjoyed it.Years later,I watched it again,and still loved it.That brings us to today,where I know the events that occurred in the real Apollo 13.Two days after the successful launch,the Oxygen tank ruptured,and the crew bravely fixed the massive problem,and the crew lived.Though the mission was a failure,it became one of the most well known Space stories (per-se).Now,Apollo 13 as a movie makes as much sense as Titanic in most peoples books,no doubt.We know the story,so why make a movie rather than just a straight-up documentary? Well,pretty much because it makes a lot of money,but I'll give Apollo 13 one thing Titanic lacks.The fact it follows it's story much better than Titanic,and is a lot more interesting for me.Now,of course,let's just get to the review and endless praise.\r\n\r\nThe plot is,as I said,about the Apollo 13 mission.Now,other than that.Now,it's extremely well written,and very moving,gripping,saddening.Despite knowing they survive,it's really sad and while not tear jerking,and the fact I'm not one who cries during a movie,unless an obnoxious tear jerkier,this still gets at least one sniffle....and a tear.Moving on,the movie is written extremely well,it's very dramatic,and really well paced.This is also a pretty long movie,nearly two and a half hours long.I really don't like pure drama,and for a movie to engage me this well,and be that long,it's pretty surprising (for me).The accuracy of the movie is flawed,but most of it is needed.The line \"Houston,we got a problem.\" is needed,as the actual spoken line would imply this is taking place in the past,and not the present: \"Houston,we've had a problem.\".Over all,the plot is amazing all around,and extremely well written.I know there are other inaccuracies,but most are small for me.\r\n\r\nThe acting is amazingly well done,and Tom Hanks is brilliant in here.I give a lot of credit to Bill Paxton too,as I usually don't like him (especially after Twister).Kevin Bacon is great too.The rest of the cast does an incredible as well,and pretty much everyone is perfectly casted.The portrayal's of the crew aboard the ship is extremely good,and feels genuine enough that it seems like the actual crew is portraying themselves.The delivery of the dialogue is excellent,with the occasional exception of the boring (if you seen Titanic,you know what I'm talking about) scenes,that are rare for me.I find those moments to come more in the middle of the beginning of the movie,so at least they get it out of the way.The best acting comes in the middle of the movie,when everything is pretty much established.It's by that point the acting is at it's maximum,and never ceases to amaze me.Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances out there,and pretty much gives the movie more and more strength each time he speaks.Over all,the acting was amazing.Simple as that.\r\n\r\nAttempting to think of what to use in the place of the minority for me in a movie,it was difficult.Pretty much,I can praise the effects and the suspense,and the fact the inaccuracies aren't noticeable for me much.But,none the less,I eventually decided to praise the movies very impressive zero gravity,rather than harnesses and strings.It makes the movie,once again,feel really...real.I actually find it unique looking,and probably one of the most interesting-looking.....things in movies I've seen.I can't tell what else to say,but it really impresses me when I look at it,and makes me jealous.I wanna be in a zero-gravity environment,and fly around.Of course,the negative effects of zero-gravity really suck (The ability to watch is pretty much gone,due to your legs becoming numb,and you pretty much are \"crippled\" for a while).Look,aside from that,there isn't much to critique the minority for me.So I picked something unique for me,and that's filming  in zero-gravity.Though it became something different.\r\n\r\nThe directing by Ron Howard is fantastic,and the movie feels quite stylish and very claustrophobic,yet wide open.Which,in the movies case,makes it quite more suspenseful,despite knowing the events (if you do).I also give Howard a lot of credit for not holding back,by making this is as intense as he could.Despite a PG rating,this really feels more like it's pushing an R rating in the intensity level none the less.Hey! It's Saw for the kiddies! Watch a man almost die in the vacuum of space! Watch an event that had national schools close! The look of a traumatized kid would probably fit a few theaters,much like Gremlins,but I'm not one of argue over the movie rating system back then (Though I can today,with Horror movies).Aside from the rating system,for some stupid reason,Howard's stylish and very intense atmosphere,combined with Tom Hanks' amazing acting (I won't bring up the failure of The Davinci Code),makes Apollo 13 a winner within the first 20 minutes.As the movie gets to the really suspenseful and dramatic area of the replacing of the blown Oxygen tank,that's when the directing and acting become insanely good,and become an amazingly done cinematic achievement.Bottom line (or topping line for this movie),Apollo 13 deserves a pure gold medal in the directorial department.\r\n\r\nThere are no characters for a movie like this.Much like United 93,I won't criticize real human beings.So,I'll tell of the portrayal.I already said that the way the acting is,it feels like they're all being played by the real people who where in the Apollo 13 mission.I truly find that a strong point for this.Now,side by side,of course,there may be differences,but I don't know since I don't know the people who where in the mission.I truly haven't got anything else to say because,truthfully,Apollo 13 seems to do a great job of keeping in tune in with the real people.Now,maybe I'm wrong (of course I am),but from my knowledge and crappy memory,This does seem like a great portrayal of everyone who was involved in the Apollo 13 mission.I truly find it a great representation of them all,and for all the right reasons.The fact they nearly sacrificed themselves for there fellow astronauts isn't an insult as a few might think.I really find that Tom Hanks,and everyone else did a fantastic job making them more like heroes,and less like,in the hands of another writer,director,and actors,lunatics (I say that because,rest assured,that would have happened in the hands of others).Over all,it's the combined efforts of everyone involved in here that makes the characters come to life.They've been done a lot of justice in the movie,which makes me happy to see.\r\n\r\nIf anything has made Apollo 13 famous,aside from it being one of the greatest movies out there in my honest opinion,it's the dialogue.It is phenomenal,it is magnificent,it is some of the best dialogue in a movie.The movies most famous line,for most,is when Tom Hanks states \"Houston,we have a problem.\".I already said the inaccuracies here,and the fact it's required to make it so the movie takes place in the present,and not the past (so it doesn't become an inaccurate documentary).I consider my favorite line in the entire movie to be a line I should go by,and probably one of the greatest lines in a movie I've ever seen: \"Failure is not an option.\".That was never actually said in real life,it was made up by Ron Howard.Even then,it's one of the greatest lines I've ever heard in a movie.Enough quoting,I really consider Apollo 13.As for the development of the \"characters\",it's brilliantly done,and delivered,and shown,really well.Bringing the characters to life even more.It's another strength as to why the characters feel even more life,pretty much making the on screen characters who they are in real life.I will state that,in the beginning,it feels a little boring.If I compare it to the rest of the movie,it's over shadowed to the point it's gone.I'd consider the first five minutes boring,if only because it's pretty much just credits.Afterwords,it vanishes.I'd say that's pretty much worthy of fast forwarding,if you've got some prior knowledge (as I do,for the most part),of the event that occurred,or have researched the astronauts involved in the Apollo 13 mission.To sum things up though,the dialogue is brilliantly done,and the development makes the movies characters some of the most well done in a movie I've seen.\r\n\r\nOver all,Apollo 13 is a magnificently done,brilliantly directed,amazingly acted,and phenomenally written movie.If you haven't seen it,I seriously recommend watching it.If you don't like it,then oh well.This movie succeeds in every department for me,and is virtually flawless,even in the first five or so minutes.Slow pacing for five minutes still makes it engaging,as slowly building suspense works better than rushing,since then everything is as sloppy as a two year old's drawing of a criminal who tried to steal something.Apollo 13 does the smart thing by slowly building it to one of the most amazingly done sequences in a movie out there (At least in the real/true event sub-genre).It's a dramatic and amazingly well told story about one of the most close encounters with space mission out there.It's a pretty accurate movie to,so it makes for something interesting,though inaccuracies are still in here,so it's not a pure,factual basis.But aside from any of that,and as a stand alone movie,Apollo 13 scores a 10/10.With the factual basis,it's rating does not change.Not even a billionth of a point.",

Then again, that's pretty much what Howard is going for, and you can't strike him down for it. Imagine the huge task it must have been to capture the 1970 U.S. lunar mission, and the added bonus of that flight taking place during a series of historical comeuppances which wherein held the peak of nationwide positivity.\n\nTom Hanks plays Jim Lovell, a loving husband and father who's truly psyched to have his kid get the chance to watch him wave from the stars. Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert and Bill Paxton Fred Haise, guys without a ball and chain to question their accompaniment on the Apollo 13 commission. The doll with strings holding him back comes in the shape of Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, whose measles scare keeps him grounded like a growly Vietnam vet without the use of his legs or something. There isn't much depth to any of these characters, which explains my hesitation to name names of the central protagonist whom we the audience are meant to attach to. The real swoon of \"Apollo 13\" is the importance of the undertaking, and Lovell, Haise, and Swigert's persistence to get back home when their ship loses steam mid-air. They radio Houston, Texas for comfort and support from the likes of NASA flight commander Gene Kranz (a bored Ed Harris), concerned mostly with protecting his stellar rep.\n\nAgain, the united allegory is obscure enough, because \"Apollo 13\" is a pretty simple movie. That doesn't mean that when our boys swim gravity afresh it's any less of a genuine inspiration, though. And for all its novelty Howard's film doesn't make a referential chuckle at Apollo's one-liner of oncoming disaster (and even the eventual Beatles break-up, which is dismissively mentioned early in the film.) Incredibly entertaining, the movie might best be read as three men pressured to finish what they started and act calm while doing it, not so much because of their legitimate friendship but because they feel a moral obligation to. The later responsibility of the Apollo 13 operation didn't involve hyper-kinetic wizardry, but it couldn't have been completed without the cooperation of planetary parallels that with revolving drinks of coffee were asked to try, try again.",

Ed Harris was excellent as the flight director as was Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly. Great pacing by Ron Howard and one of the best films made about the space program.",

The cast is great, Tom Hanks never lets me down, Bill Paxton is great, and Kevin Bacon is just always awesome I think.  The special effects are where the film comes in 1st, I mean never before will a film show you the wonders of space and such a realistic version of it, I give major props to the special effects team.

I was unaware that the ship and crew would all make it back myself and this made the film a much more enjoyable film, I was constantly worrying about the crew and when new problems kept arising I was genuinely worried and scared. I believe however, that without such a fine cast that my care for the crew would have been weakened, Tom Hanks, puts on one of his finest performances in his career, his ambitious pilot whose dreams are snatched from his grasp is incredible and the supporting cast also provide added momentum to the film. Gary Sinisie, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon all add something different to the film. So, I believe that this is a film with very few faults, with great special effects, amazing cast and absolutely outstanding breathtaking direction, deserves all the acclaim it received.",

I will only say that because I watch the special features and saw how the shot that scene. The simulated an explosion of the base of the rocket and the did CGI for the rest. The director of Photography for this movie put the camera in positions that are truly breath taking. The plot was also entertaining. It kept me emotionally and physically interested for all 2 hours.

The Visual effects and scenes out in space look almost 3d and highly realistic. The suspense both in Houston and in Space really drive this film as a great drama in the 1990s.

All APOLLO 13 does is rely on the resonance of the actual Apollo 13 mission and hope for the best. Everything is devastatingly competent. What little dramatic tension there is, is overshadowed by the need to get through each story event. Worst of all, Tom Hanks fails to hold the film together.

            "content": "Along with Backdraft, Apollo 13 is one of Ron Howards ultimate best films. The film chronicles the failed mission to the moon and the ensuing rescue attempt to bring them home. A film that is both spectacular and powerful, Apollo 13 is a superbly crafted drama film.  One of things that Apollo 13 does very well is building up the tension. Obviously we all know that the astronauts came back home safely,  but still there always is a feeling of tension going on throughout the film from the point where theres an explosion on board the spacecraft to the safe landing. Every time I watch Apollo 13, I get that same feeling. Ron Howard's brilliant directing  makes this possible, and you always get that same feeling every time you watch it. Ron Howard has assembled a great cast of actors to portray the astronauts. Tom Hanks plays Jim Lovell, Bill Paxton plays Fred Haise and Kevin Bacon plays Jack Sigert. They play the Apollo 13 astronaut with much respect to the real astronauts who flew the near fatal mission. Gary Sinise plays Ken Mattingly, the original Command module pilot. Mattingly still plays a vital role in the story as he tries to find a way to get as much power from the crafts battery to restart the craft.  Ron Howard strips away the traditional way of telling a story big Hollywood overtones. Instead, Howard tells the story of Apollo 13 like it was using fact instead of fiction. The film is very technical and rich in detail. Every aspect of the story has been covered with tremendous respect from the real life incident.   Apollo 13 is a well acted, well told and well directed drama film. This is without a doubt Ron Howards best film.  A powerful drama film, Apollo 13 tells a story about a failed mission, but also that it was a success due to the fact that they all came back safe. This is a film that has definitely aged well, and doesn't look dated whatsoever.  A fine masterful film, Apollo 13 is a must see film, and what I appreciate the most about the film is that they didn't try to romanticize the story sort of like Titanic, they told it like fact and stayed true to the historical background of the film. The film is not cliche trite or boring. Apollo 13 remains a solid historical film that tells it like is and doesn't use a made up story to make the film seem emotionally charged. If you must watch one Ron Howard film, make it Apollo 13.",

I can't really criticise the characters for being uninteresting, because these are real people. It sounds like I hate the film, but I do have things about it that I love. First, the acting was superb, and the special effects were perfect. When its suspenseful, it's brilliant, and when it gets interesting, it's impossible to dislike.",

An intensely realistic retelling of the doomed spacecraft, and how the dedication and skill from all turned a near tragedy into a human triumph.  Apollo 13 will boost your pulse, raise your hair, and give you goosebumps all at the same time.  It's a super tense thrill ride that's filled to the brim with suspense and special effects.  The set design and cinematography are astounding, Howard and company literally brought the 1960's back to life again.  The cockpits of the spacecraft were stunningly brought back to life.  Spectacular movie making, a cinematic masterpiece that will move in ways that only the best films do.  A visceral look back to those tense few days where crew and personnel alike worked to the point of exhaustion to bring this spacecraft and it's crew home.\n        Ron Howard put together an all-star cast for this one, Tom Hanks plays Jim Lovell masterfully.  Hanks' talent never ceases to completely amaze me.  Bill Paxton in a great role as Fred Haize.  It also features Kevin Bacon in a brilliant role as Jack Swigert.  Gary Sinise is also great in his role as Ken Mattingly- the astronaut that got snubbed from the mission.  For me it was Ed Harris, who plays fight director Gene Kranz, that stole the show in this film.  He is legendary in a role that demanded intense emotion and patience.  A simply steller cast that couldn't get any better.\n         Apollo 13 throws you straight into the heart of the failed mission, it's a deep look into the ever-enduring human spirit.  Against overwhelming odds these men never gave up, it's breathtaking, the courage these men showed exemplifies the human spirit.  It's great to see a movie that's absolutely true, capture the emotion from all involved so well.  A classic masterpiece that won't be matched, it's simply too remarkable.",

With excellent performances by Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon, and ably assisted by Gary Sinise and a strong Mission Control ensemble, Apollo 13 is remarkable in the way it takes you from the earth, and brings you back home again. \n\nIt's a great chapter in the conquest of space, and gives you a deep admiration for the people that worked on these Moon missions, and what a unifying factor they were for a country divided. It's also one of Howard's best efforts in creating tension. You know they're going to get back all right, but the obstacles keep coming, and you really feel the relief when they're safe. An excellent job. \n\nInteresting to note all the actual weightless footage used, courtesy of the training aircraft, and the meticulous detail put into the film. Strange to think how advanced the technology was considered for the time, and how far we've come since then.\n\nRecommended.",

Howard has to take all the credit for sticking to what really happened and not trying to over dramatise the true events of the mission. It never gets too patriotic and overly emotional; it's just a great account of one of NASA's most disastrous missions.\n\nThe Apollo 13 mission suffered an explosion after a routine stirring of the oxygen tanks, which left the three man crew, Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, in a serious fight for their lives. It took the endurance of the crew and the help of hundreds of people in mission control to get them back safely. The cast is excellent, Tom Hanks, Kevin bacon, Bill Paxton and Gary Sinise or on top form but it's Ed Harris, as the Mission Control Chief, that steals the show with a brilliant performance. The effects are top notch, even the CGI effects for the Rocket Launch look excellent and better than many of today?s films which is quite an achievement given this film was made in 1995. There is plenty of actual footage from the event interspersed with the films footage. The pace is perfect which keeps the tension levels high throughout. The only real downfall of the film, which ironically is not the film makers fault, is that we can only feel so much tension at the situations as we already know that the crew all made it back safely. Huge praise has to be given to Howard for managing to make the film so gripping given its background.\n\nApollo 13 really is an inspirational and excellently made film with pure entertainment throughout.",

I being The Nerd. Not AVGN however.\r\n\r\nThis movie was fantastic. Even though I personally don't believe that the Apollo missions were real, this movie is God D@m real!!!! First, it bugs me that Tom Hanks looks like Dan Akroid. Second, it bugs me that WWE would name a stupid wrestler (not to say wrestlers are stupid,) after one great Astronaut. Thirdly, this movie makes you feel like your  there. The acting and visuals are so impressive, they give you the feeling of what it would be like in there in space.\r\n\r\nThe director was OBVIOUSLY extremely smart. He puts every shot into thought, something as smart as I get I will never have the patients to do. The scriptwriter went above and beyond with only one problem: The movie either feels long or is to long, took me two days to watch this film. The producer didn't spare any expense he gave them the opprotunity, and the editor does things exactly right. The slashers who made this movie are fantastic.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting that they tell the story of Apollo 13 and not 12 or 1, that was not typical. They also don't recreat any transmissions, only scenes. What I mean is that they use real television broadcasts from 1970. Again, the acting is awesome, it makes you feel like you know these guys. Even as this is based off real life, it took a good director to recognize the irony and drama that went into this story.\r\n\r\nHeck. what am I saying, A1 was a pretty huge part of this movie. But it's like, it's like dirt. Not bad, but good. Dirt makes up so much of what we call the earth, or at least what we feel is earth, yet we recognize plants and animals more like earth. But dirt not only makes up more earth, not only does it help keep living things survive, it is earth. Basically, in a sense, Apollo 13 was Apollo 1 except successful. It's the symbolsim and metaphor stuff you here about in school.\r\n\r\nI could talk more and more about how this movie is so realistic, but here's the stuff: this is awesome space. It gives you the fun of space. It gives you space, outer space, but not space between you and a zillion years of cold darkness. But, that's the thing: this movie is all over the place.\r\n\r\nAt this point you probably wonder: why the heck was he reviewed Apollo 13 and not Star Wars? Well, I used to do reviews for YouTube. When I watch a movie more than once, it almost takes away the charm unless it's done amazingly. I also need to get off my butt and watch some of the movies in my collection,\r\n\r\nAnd Apollo 13, the rating? 4.9/5. Almost there, just not there yet.",

Two big thumbs up just for that. i mean seriously it is like you are transformed into this entire different world. i may not remember right now but no movie based on real life Space travel have ever gave me that feel, i never felt like this. this movie defines America or NASA. though it was a sad turn or sad time for them because as you know the are not being able to perform the mission after the accident takes place and in the end when they show individual characters, what they are doing right now, that scene just makes your eyes get all teared up because you feel for them, you realize what actually this meant to them and their families the town the whole nation and perhaps the whole world at that time. i mean keeping your foots on Moon.\n\nyou know this is a perfect movie when there is a powerful story, told with absolute brilliant technical detail, superb performances and everything else done well. this movie shows from the start the two missions that were done before, one was the first Apollo-1 which met with a horrible accident killing those astronauts and the other and the most remarkable one, Apollo-11 where Mr Armstrong lands on Moon while they are watching it on TV. Jim Lovell played by Tom Hanks himself had been on a mission but that was just to orbit Moon and he wants to go back this time, to land on Moon. it happens as the are being send through Apollo-13 not 14. Ken Mattingly can't go because of some disease instead of him, Jack Swigert goes along with Fred Haise. Marilyn, wife of Jim isn't quite sure about all this, she sees nightmare and after all that, her wedding ring falls into the shower drain. the shuttle is launched and everyone, families, friends, town people and the nation are hopeful ti see the back soon. as part of the routine check up, Swigert switches something that has something to do with the Oxygen tank i guess but one of them explodes with a leakage. the are now trapped, aborts the mission, they have to find a way to come back home, technical and health difficulties and above everything else, a dream.\n\ni personally think that the standout performance was from Ed Harris as Gene Kranz. he was truly spectacular in his dialogue delivery and his emotions. this was a performance where you could understand completely, like 100% what was going on in the character's mind. his face was speaking everything he or the character were feeling. n excellent performance. also Tom Hanks was good, he fitted in this role very easily as usual. Katheleen Quinlan gave a good performance too. everyone was nice in this movie also even Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton and Gary Sinse.\n\nexcellent written story and plot with a superb screenplay. one of the best Editing i have ever seen in a movie like this. no wonder it was Oscar nominated. it looks superb and has emotions powerful enough to make you cry in fear, excitement and everything else. a powerful and excellently made drama by Ron Howard. one of the best movies of Ron Howard making him truly Ron Howard. a must see.",

            "content": "Probably one of the most significant things about Apollo 13 is the fact that it managed to be such a strikingly realistic film despite the abundance of well-known Hollywood actors. Tom Hanks, of course, can convincingly act any part in the world, and his role in Apollo 13 is no exception. All of the actors involved seemed to have been given parts that they were born to play, because they were so successful in the roles. The true events of the historic Apollo 13 mission are amazingly re-created here, and the results are spectacular. \n\nNot only is this film wonderfully acted, it also presents a nearly flawless portrayal of the time period, even down to the slide rulers that were used to do calculations. The audience is literally taken back in time to the 1960's, and all of these universally exciting events are brought back to life, and this is one of the things that makes this movie so special. So many films try to do this, and the vast majority of them fail miserably, so it just feels so good to occasionally see it done right.\n\nAnother thing that was used in the perfect amount in Apollo 13 was the special effects. I am entirely against excessive special effects, because if they aren't justified in being in the film, they can sometimes ruin the film by themselves (remember The Perfect Storm?). The special effects in Apollo 13, however, served the film very well. Of course, the most significant special effect in the film, aside from the space scenes, was the zero gravity, which was done flawlessly. I'm just glad that they decided to go up in one of those Zero-G planes for these scenes, rather than have the actors drift lazily around and act as if they are in zero gravity, because that would have taken a lot away from the film. \n\nApollo 13 has an excellent story made even better by the fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining film, but is also educational, which should please parents (as if they need any more pleasing than seeing their younger years brought back to life on the silver screen). Definite must-see, Apollo 13 is a contemporary classic.",

The period-recreation and special effects are both stunning, but the viewer will hardly notice them as he is drawn into the story. That is an example of excellent filmmaking where the special effects are necessary, but they donât carry the film. There seems to be devotion from the entire cast and crew of the film to give this story the telling it deserves and their efforts come through with flying colors. Unlike The Right Stuff (which at times seemed detached and unemotional), this true space-drama boils over with a definite passion for the material and the message. A moving, inspirational and spectacularly exciting film â one of the great accomplishments of American cinema.",
