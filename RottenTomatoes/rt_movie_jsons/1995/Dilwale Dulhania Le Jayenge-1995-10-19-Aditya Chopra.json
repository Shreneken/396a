            "content": "A sweet and fun romance that utilizes a traditional 'unlikely, unblessed love story' but that blurs the line between serious plot elements, cultural commentary, comedic subplots, and musical numbers in a way that only Bollywood can. You'll have a tearful reunion between two lovers torn apart by the conventions of conservative Indian society in one scene, and then follow it up with Shahrukh Khan in a Crocodile Dundee hat snagging his rival with a rope trap before shooting him down with an over-the-shoulder pistol shot while a spaghetti Western theme plays. And yet, it does strangely work.\n\nSurprisingly subversive for the genre without losing the charm, DDLJ (thank God that an acronym is considered acceptable for a title like that) touches on a reimagining of Indian values as independent from the nation itself, where previous romantic comedies traded on an unvarnished nationalism that made the films sometimes less than accessible to an international audience. The international flavor and less than flattering look at consevatism in Indian society instead provides a much more humanist take on the genre while keeping the distinctive identity of the genre intact.\n\nBesides the brightness and intensity of the musical numbers, set design, and costumes, the film is exceptional for its note-perfect lead performances, with Kajol delivering the modest hopefulness (balancing loyalty to family with personal desire) that defined an India in a cultural transition and global diaspora, and Khan feeling like he's virtually unimprovable with a profusely flowing, easygoing charm. Rather long at over three hours in runtime and with scenes that could have been slightly shortened so you wouldn't have to budget half an afternoon to watch it all in one sitting, but still rather enjoyable, particularly in its romantic comedy components.\n\nAmrish Puri doing an angry, wide-eyed glare is approximately 25% of the movie's runtime, just a forewarning. (3.5/5)",

What I really enjoyed with this film is the freedom of expression it conveys to an audience. colorful, entertaining, filled with great music and powerful symbols, a film like this one is almost unfathomable to western audiences who will probably dislike the length and the naivety of some scenes. Bollywood cinema is an enigma to western audiences used to heavy serious drama instead of the more theatrical and choreographed approach chosen here. I enjoyed being part of this journey, I loved the characters and was fascinated by the costumes and the body language of the actors. Somehow I felt the characters were much more layered and complex than the one we usually see in our western, supposedly more realistic films. this film is an experience to enjoy and a beautiful insight in one of the most incredibly and complex society. India seems to be it's own world and a film like this one offers a unique glimpse into the heart of a nation who is still able to dream in bright colors. Wonderful experience.",

However, despite whatever its subject matter may be, DDLJ ultimately rises or falls on the strength of male and female leads. Some audiences may find Shahrukh Khan's character charming, while others may simply find him annoying. I found him to be a little of both.  Kajol's performance is a lot more consistent and easily accepted. It's these two performances and their chemistry together that carry the film and help it overcome its glaring weaknesses.\n\nI guess my main problems with the film were its length (over 3 hours, typical for Bollywood pictures). I don't know why most of these Bollywood films are not edited down to more easily digestible sizes, but then again my apprehension may stem from my lack of acclimation to Bollywood scripts. Another problem I had was the film's climax, which features an excessively violent fight scene that feels out-of-place in this otherwise tame love story. I guess that's it, really --- I just wished DDLJ had spent more time in the cutting room floor and had gotten rid of the bizarre violence at the end. Otherwise, DDLJ is a pleasant, if flawed, romantic epic.",

So the first time in this movie hero instead of claiming asylum with his heroine yo some safer place, decides to fight against her father's so-called ego & that was mera punjab mera punjab, i mean for the hell n sake, what the fuck Amrish Puri was doing in Londo if he was missing punjab that bad, & always found flaws in brit. \nWell, this movie is not fully upto the international standards but atleast worth watching if your parents are willing you to marry in back home lol",

It's all bold colours and unbridled romanticism from start to finish, and a lot of fun. Kajol plays the girl who, despite of her arranged marriage, eventually falls for a rambunctious boy (Shahrukh Khan) while on a tour of Europe, to the great disapproval of her traditional father. Both romantic leads are great, but Khan stands out, his cartoonish energy a delight to watch, especially during the enjoyable musical numbers. While the two young lovers are eager embrace a modern relationship, the film also stresses the importance of preserving one's culture and traditions. One notable problem: too long. It feels like two movies crammed into one.",

            "content": "Silly Bride, Respect Is for Boys!\r\n\r\nThe most chilling sequence in this movie, which of course isn't supposed to have any, is when the bride's mother (Farida Jalal, I think) sits down to have a talk with her daughter (Simran, played by Kajol) about the boy she's loved in Europe before returning to Punjab for her arranged marriage.  The mother tells Simran that, when the mother was a little girl, she was brought up to believe that girls were equal to boys.  Then, her father made her sacrifice her education for her brothers, who needed it more.  One sacrifice led to another, and she eventually realized that it was all a woman's life was made of.  Sister, daughter, wife, mother--all is sacrifice.  Therefore, Simran must bend her will to her father's and marry Kuljit (Parmeet Sethi), who mentions once that he'll marry Simran and leave her in Punjab while he goes off to London and fools around.  What Simran wants is not and will not be important.  She must fulfill her father's wishes and keep her father's promise.\r\n\r\nSimran, on the other hand, has been raised in London.  Her father left Punjab twenty years earlier, and Simran and her sister, Rajeshwari (Pooja Ruparel), are more English than Indian in their attitudes.  Her father, Chaudhry (Amrish Puri), has betrothed her in her childhood to the son of his best friend, Ajit (Satish Shah).  (I think; I'm not clear on some of the names, and the credits on IMDB are very bad.)  It doesn't matter, as her mother tells her, what she wants.  On the other hand, she convinces her father to let her spend a month in Europe with some friends.  On this trip, she meets the seriously obnoxious Raj (Shahrukh Khan), who seems determined to make her life miserable for all he's hitting on her so madly.  In fact, that seems to be part of the problem.  He can't seem to get the concept of \"unwanted advances.\"  Somehow, though--and the situation seems to include getting her roaring drunk--they fall in love.  Then, her father takes the whole family off to Punjab to get her away from her Western beliefs and love and so forth, and Raj follows her.\r\n\r\nI was horrified by a lot of things in this movie that are clearly serious cultural differences.  For example, we are clearly intended to think that Simran is far too uptight.  She only accepts Raj's advances under the influence of cognac.  Mostly, she treats Raj as though he's simply a nuisance.  The thing is, though, he is a nuisance.  He annoyed me to the extent that I was wondering how the Punjabi arranged husband could possibly be worse, and I knew he had to be, because it's the way this storyline progresses.  Only Raj is being so obnoxious in one store that he makes them both miss the train.  He is a jerk to her father at the beginning of the movie, before he ever meets her.  However, we are supposed to see him as the desirable one, the man she ought to marry.  Obviously--and again, it's not as though the basic frame of this story is original or anything--Simran must go from disliking him intensely to falling in love with him.  However, the film requires change in her that I don't really think is necessary.\r\n\r\nI also have to tell you that I find his change more than a little cynical.  We'll leave aside the total improbability that he can find her in London.  We'll even ignore the greater improbability that he can find her in Punjab.  Whatever.  It's a movie.  But once he gets into the family's awareness, I find most of what he does contrived.  He sets up a totally ludicrous trap to worm his way into the fianc√©'s good graces.  Once there, he drops the fianc√©'s family for the purposes of worming his way into Simran's family's good graces.  I do find it vaguely honourable that he refuses to elope with her, though it gets silly after a while.  I guess it's supposed to be character redemption, though it would take a lot more than that to redeem him in my mind.  However, I think it's quite obvious that his interest in Simran's family is not in any kind of idea that it might be nice to get along with Simran's family.  It's trying to pry her father's approval loose.\r\n\r\nI don't have a lot of experience with Bollywood.  Probably I will watch more as time goes by.  I do find it interesting, at least from a cultural perspective, and at very least this was a beautiful film--and I don't just mean Kajol, who is a hugely striking woman.  (Shahrukh Khan?  Not nearly as attractive.)  Watching her in the white dress run through the mustard field is definitely worth it, and much of the clothing is simply gorgeous.  Okay, some of the colours are a bit much to my eyes, but still.  And I have to admit that I find the musical numbers entertaining if nothing else--the one where Raj manages to pull backup singers/dancers out of thing air is vastly amusing.  (The wedding one is actually a lot more believable.)  It's just that, as I look back on this movie, I wonder which I will remember more.  Beautiful woman in white running through mustard fields or beautiful mother explaining to her daughter that she can't have the life she wants because her father's wishes are more important?",
