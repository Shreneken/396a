            "content": "Sense and Sensibility\" is a 1995 period drama film directed by Ang Lee, based on the novel of the same name by Jane Austen. The film features an all-star cast, including Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, and Alan Rickman, and was a critical and commercial success upon its release.\nThe film tells the story of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor (Thompson) and Marianne (Winslet), who are left in financial dire straits after their father dies and their half-brother inherits the family estate. Forced to move to a cottage in the countryside, the sisters navigate the tricky waters of love and society as they attempt to find suitable husbands.\nThompson, who also wrote the screenplay, delivers a nuanced and heartfelt performance as Elinor, the sensible and pragmatic sister who struggles to reconcile her feelings for the reserved and honorable Edward Ferrars (Grant). Winslet is equally impressive as Marianne, the impulsive and romantic sister who falls for the dashing and charismatic John Willoughby (Greg Wise), only to learn the harsh realities of love and class.Lee's direction is elegant and restrained, capturing the beauty and grace of the English countryside while also emphasizing the emotional undercurrents of the story. The supporting cast is excellent as well, with Rickman delivering a memorable turn as the brooding and conflicted Colonel Brandon.\nThe target audience of the film \"Sense and Sensibility\" is primarily adult viewers who enjoy period dramas, romance, and literary adaptations. The film's themes and characters will likely appeal to viewers who appreciate Austen's writing and the Regency era in which the story is set. The film's tone and pacing are more measured and deliberate than modern-day action or blockbuster films, making it more suitable for those who enjoy a slower, character-driven story.\nAccording to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The film also received positive reviews from audiences and was a commercial success, grossing over $134 million worldwide against a budget of $16.5 million.\nOverall, \"Sense and Sensibility\" is a beautifully crafted and emotionally resonant film that captures the wit, wisdom, and romance of Jane Austen's classic novel. With its stellar performances, stunning cinematography, and impeccable production design, it is a true cinematic gem that is not to be missed.",

            "content": "Emma Thompson has better chemistry with Alan Rickman than with Hugh Grant. Given the sizable age gap between Kate Winslet and Professor Snape, I found myself expecting Snape to end up with Professor Trelawney by the end but nope. And don't give me \"it happened in the book\" as a counter-argument, there was a more respectable age difference in the Jane Austen novel. That nitpick aside, Sense & Sensibility is a really good period piece/romantic drama with great performances & cinematography, a riveting script that gave Emma Thompson an unusual Oscar combination for Best Actress & Best Adapted Screenplay and Ang Lee's direction helping the film stay true to the novel while still updating it in such a way that it appeals to changing, *ahem*, sensibilities of the late '90s. I don't think this is quite as compelling or witty as Pride & Prejudice but this is still excellent filmmaking in its own right.\nP.S. Is it just me or is this the only one of Jane Austen's holy trinity of novels - Pride and Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility and Emma - that didn't get a 21st-century retelling? Maybe we should do that, provided we have the right filmmakers to avoid the usual nonsense that results in such lovely words as \"woke\", a term which I will *never* use unironically, regardless of my opinion on the media's quality.",

Sense and Sensibility is a great book by Miss Austen, and this film does the book justice, in my personal opinion. The film looks gorgeous, the camera-work, the locations and the costumes. The script sparkled with wit, subtlety, romance and heartache, especially when Marianne goes out into the rain and gets herself ill. The music is lovely also. The performances were exceptional. Period-film veteran Emma Thompson is lovely here as Elinor Dashwood, and Kate Winslet matches her perfectly in a beautifully-blended portrayal of the tragic Marianne. As for the men, they were very good too. Hugh Grant was exceedingly charming as the male lead, and I have read many reviews criticising Alan Rickman's acting.(not on IMDb though) He may have been older than Miss Austen intended, he was very good also as Colonel Brandon, but not as good as the other three. His style of acting is very suave and charismatic, like Sean Connery and George Sanders. If you've seen him in Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves you'll know what I mean. All in all, a lovely film, maybe not the best period drama, but has plenty of elements that makes it truly memorable. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Still, the film does a marvelous job at creating dialogue, atmosphere, and performances that do away with much of the stuffy pretentiousness associated with an Austen novel and instead provide a legitimately endearing, funny, and relatable period romance. Castings here made the careers of many of its young stars, and added to many more, with Thompson, Winslet, Rickman, and Grant all providing excellent characterizations, and some of the supporting roles feeling just as substantial (particularly Spriggs as the boisterous Mrs. Jennings and Laurie cast out of type as the taciturn Mr. Palmer). Production quality is uniformly solid, and the film itself holds up to modern standards and should be enjoyed for decades to come. Completely changed what classic 19th century British literature could be adapted to in film; David Lean no longer reigned without equal, the director/screenwriter team of Lee and Thompson proving fit for the task.

With his fourth feature, director Ang Lee crafted an astonishing adaptation of Jane Austen's book that holds up today as a modern classic. Using sumptuous cinematography, Lee draws viewers into the world of two sisters searching for love in the 19th Century. From intimate close-ups to gorgeous establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's historical setting. The sets, costumes and musical score are all carefully chosen, combining to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. It is hard to not admire the astonishing performances from the cast. Emma Thompson delivers one of the best performances of her career as Elinor Dashwood. With mesmerizing expressions, she conveys the innocence, exuberance and free-spirited persona of the classic literary character. Kate Winslet is equally appealing in the role of a feisty woman searching for love. In one of her first lead roles, Winslet proves to be a star in the making. The supporting cast, which includes the hilarious Hugh Grant, is also excellent and worthy of recognition. Although \"Sense and Sensibility\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At over two hours, it is slightly long and suffers from a drawn-out running-time. Nevertheless, fans of Jane Austen will definitely enjoy \"Sense and Sensibility\" and so will movie-goers seeking old-fashioned entertainment. At a time when modern audiences have never heard of Jane Austen, it's a stirring reminder that her timeless stories are worth retelling on the big-screen.",

Ang Lee did a beautiful job highlighting the yearning, loneliness, desperation, hopefulness, and disappointments of women of this time and it makes it very palpable for modern viewers. Which is why I don't mind that Thompson is a bit old for Elinor, because would a modern audience understand she's pretty much an old maid at 19?

            "content": "Sense and Sensibility is arguably one of the best movies I've seen. Created in 1995 by Ang Lee and based on Jane Austen's novel with the same name, we follow the story of a family from Norland who go through a lot, to say the least. The family consists of a father, mother and 3 daughters. A traditional family you would think but, let's dive into the less pleasant stuff the family Dashwood has been through.\nThe movie is about the Dashwood family consisting of a father, mother and their three daughters: Marianne, Elinore and Margarette who were happily living in their country house in Norland until the father dies. The father leaves everything to his son John. He was the son of his other wife. The father asked John to promise that he will help his wife and children. John did indeed promise he would help them but after his death, John's wife, called Fanny, manipulates him and he ends up not helping the Dashwood ladies.\nThe ladies are forced to move out. In the meantime, when the Dashwood ladies are in the country house in Norland, Edward Ferras, who is John's brother in law, comes for a visit. He and Elinor seem to like each other but Edwards sister doesn't allow their bond to develop any further so the Dashwood ladies move into their new house. When Marianne sprains her ankle while walking with her sister, she meets Willoughby, she immediately feels attracted to him. He helps her and brings her home. Mr. Willoughby seems to be interested in Marianne and they spend a lot of time together. Everyone is convinced that they are planning to eventually get married, but then they go to London and everything gets out of hand.\n I really liked the story because it wasn't a typical love story as you see in every romantic movie these days. The movie has a lot of scenes that make you think deeply and teach you a lot about life. I feel like I look differently at some things in life after watching this movie. The movie is played very immersivly, sometimes it felt like I was truly in the movie. \nMy favorite scene would have to be the one where Edward kindheartedly wipes the tears off of the crying Elinor with his handkerchief and allows her to keep it. I guess you could say it's because I appreciate the gesture of love but there's more to it than that, at least in my eyes. It symbolizes one of the few times something goes right for the Dashwood family and also reminded Elinor never to be too gloomy because she'd always look at his handkerchief whenever she'd want to reminisce. So it's not only a beautiful gesture of their mutual affection, but also a symbol of things yet to come.\nThe characters were also completely different from the stereotypes we have nowadays. For example Elinor, she was the one who kept her feelings to herself and didn't tell anyone about it in contrast to Marianne who was very open about her feelings. When she felt unhappy, others would notice. My favorite character was Elinor. I really liked the way she acted, and she also fancied her personality. This is because I think we have a lot in common and sometimes I saw myself in her. Her personality really took my attention, she was the one who put aside her own sorrow and only thought about her sisters, her mother and it was very beautiful. \nTo conclude, I really liked the performances of the main cast. The movie was played beautifully. Though my personal favourite would have to be Emma Thompson as Elinor. She knew just how to pull one's heartstrings and make me feel sad, happy or whatever was required from her. For a movie filmed in 1995 I honestly think the camera work amazingly good, people often underestimate how crucial that is to a movie. The music didn't lack behind either and really made sure it felt like a cohesive experience. I really liked Sense and Sensibility.",

            "content": "I enjoyed the cold, detached approach that Ang Lee brought to The Ice Storm (1997), a story about very privileged, dislikable people who face a tragedy, but when I watch an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel I want to see someone who loves the characters. Whit Stilman's Love and Friendship (2016) is probably my favorite Austen film but obviously I am not expecting a film as big as Sense and Sensibility to contain all of the idiosyncrasies of an independent film. I don't like Kate Winslet, I've made that perfectly clear in my Titanic (1997) review, and I felt that she was terrible here and she almost ruined the film as a whole. If you want to see a really good, mainstream Jane Austen adaptation watch Pride and Prejudice (2005) before you even consider going near this.\n\nElinor, Emma Thompson, and Marianne, Kate Winslet, are kicked out of their house and lose their significant fortune after the death of their father as their older brother and his wife take control. They are forced to search for financial security in the form of husbands after this and while Elinor quietly pines for Edward Ferrars, Hugh Grant, who she expects will not marry her because she is poor. Colonel Brandon, Alan Rickman, is an older man who is in love with Marianne who herself loves the unreliable John Willoughby, Greg Wise. The two very different sisters will eventually find love with the right men and learn to lean on one another.\n\nThe utterly lovable Emma Thompson makes the film worthwhile as she is the perfect Marianne, convincing in her strong principles, sensibility and quiet sadness at her lack of romantic prospects. In the scenes in which Elinor and Edward interact it becomes clear that Thompson can act circles around Grant but he is entertaining enough employing his usual charms. Conversely, Winslet is quite unconvincing as Marianne with every move she makes feeling false and her facial expressions looking the same throughout. Had Rachel Weisz been cast in the role I would be far more charmed by her character and I think the film would work better as a whole. Rickman is very good as Colonel Brandon but he's a better romantic lead in Truly, Madly, Deeply (1990). Some of the acting is great, some of it is awful much like the film itself.\n\nThe whole film in it's technical execution felt very constructed and that prevented me from really engaging with it because I could always sense Lee and those making the films and their decisions instead of becoming immersed in the world. Even the outside environments look like matte paintings and when indoor all of the people seem to be cold and stiff like frozen fish. Traditional British costume dramas that I love like The Bostonians (1984) and The Portrait of a Lady (1996) allow to feel the environments that these people live in. You can smell the sea spray and feel the cool air when you watch Vanessa Redgrave and Madeleine Potter argue in The Bostonians. I wanted that here but I didn't feel anything viscerally during this film and I may as well have been sitting in a theatre watching some RADA graduates perform around a hermetically sealed set.\n\nI applaud Thompson for her screenplay as it is very faithful to the novel while also updating some elements of the book to make them more understandable to modern audiences. She was very good at never making this too jarring and writing the dialogue to sound period-accurate while not being as confusing as Shakespeare or Ibsen. She would win the Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award in 1996 and I would say she deserved it despite facing strong competition in Apollo 13 (1995) and Leaving Las Vegas (1995).\n\nThis is a film that I wouldn't recommend because despite Thompson's best efforts she can't save a film from awkward staging and the presence of Kate Winslet. Were Merchant Ivory Productions to have made them I think this would have a better production, more filled with life and loving of it's characters like The Remains of the Day (1993). This is a film that approaches being great but is let down by a few poor decisions but I hope we will get a better adaptation one day.",

            "content": "The first thing that needs to be mentioned in Sense and Sensibility is the cast. They have a superb mix of the best British actresses and actors. Emma Thompson is perfectly restrained as Elinor. I love how well she presents that unaffected demeanor that is considered proper in this society, but she can also make dramatic swings into tearful emotion when pushed too far. Kate Winslet is the perfect counterpoint as the impetuous Marianne. While in modern society her behavior would never be considered inappropriate, she plays it with just enough raw emotion to create a strong contrast with Thompson, so we know she\u2019s going too far. The other performance that needs to be singled out is the perfection of Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon. Despite his stoic behavior, you can feel the heavy baggage that he carries in every scene. The sets, locations, and costumes in Sense and Sensibility all work together to take you to that time and place. This made the dialogue and behavior of the characters feel natural and fitting instead of odd. I don\u2019t always understand the unwritten rules that governed British society at that time, so there are certain moments where I was confused why someone was or was not doing something. This is when I was most grateful for the cast because I could always count on them to react properly in order to clue me in on the fact that someone has overstepped their bounds or behaved in an inappropriate manner. I tend to get annoyed with this type of period piece after a while because they are all so restrained, and I just want them to express what they feel. But it works as a proper representation of the novel and what I assume society looked like at that time. The story of Sense and Sensibility is a little predictable, possibly because Jane Austen has been copied countless times. Even when there are moments that were built in as a surprise, you see it coming because everyone knows who the women are supposed to end up with at the end. One of the struggles that I concerned me was the age difference in one of the potential matches. It\u2019s the kind of thing that I struggle with in other movies, but it was addressed in the dialogue and handled in a classy way, so somehow it never bothered me after the first few minutes of that storyline. I can\u2019t fully comprehend why I got so invested in the dilemma of whether these girls would manage to get married. It seems so archaic for the happy ending to be built on a man saving them. However, I was riveted throughout. I don\u2019t know how much to credit to Jane Austen, and how much to Ang Lee, but I found Sense and Sensibility to be a lovely and moving film.",

If I had one problem, it would probably be Hugh Grant as Edward, the nice and charming young man who falls for Thompson's character.

He's usually the villain or portrayed as the villain. But, here, he gives calm and easy to follow and enjoy performance. Another problem, however, is the way the movie ends. \n\nI know that's how it ends in the book, but hear me out. I didn't like how little chemistry Winslet's and Rickman's characters got out of each other. Yeah, they marry in the end and it's cute, but they only share like 2 scenes where they clearly are in love. I know they had to sort of back away from that, given that technically, Winslet's character is only 15 and Rickman's is 35. But, I still think they could've worked a little more in.

Between the stunning scenery, perfect casting, and director Ang Lee's delicate treatment of the story, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood step right off of the page and into our hearts.  As one might expect, the film moves a little slow but the story is so addictive that you won't mind.  The atmosphere of the English countryside is magic and the indoor shots of high class homes have a true transporting power; however, the true power of this story comes from unexpected surprises and the need to know what happens next.  Emma Thompson is stunning as Elinor and it is easy to see why she received four Oscar nominations in the early 90's.  On top of her Best Actress nomination for this role, she won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.  She is perfectly matched with Kate Winslet, who earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination.  This was only Winslet's second feature film role but it is easy to see the natural acting ability that has enabled her to be a significant presence in the film industry.  These leading ladies deliver the rich dialogue in a flowing manner that makes it as beautiful to hear as it is to comprehend.  The supporting characters are also well-cast, from the deep voice of Alan Rickman (Colonel Brandon) and the good looks of Greg Wise (Willoughby) to the character acting of Imelda Staunton (Charlotte) and a young Hugh Laurie.  I did not care for Hugh Grant at first, but his delivery of Edward's final dialogue brought a tear to my eye.  I wouldn't call myself a Jane Austin fan but this rendition of \"Sense and Sensibility\" has inspired me to look deeper into her world and experience more of her stories.",

This movie was honestly not my type, and with that said, I didn't really care that much about what's going on. The cast are great, the plot is fine I guess, and the writing is good which I'm glad to see that Emma Thompson adapt it really well even though I've never read the book. It had some funny moments but I didn't think it was that funny. The costumes are good, and the set designs are really good. When it gets to the middle when lots of drama moments were going on, that's when I was starting to get interested in. The drama moments are really effective, and it makes me learn more about the characters. Sense and Sensibility may not be my favorite Ang Lee movie, but it's still an enjoyable flick for Ang Lee and Jane Austen's fans.",

A nice, inoffensive historical piece about 2 sisters (played by Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, both deservedly Oscar nominated) who go through trials and tribulations and loves and losses after they're forced to move out of the lavish house they grew up in. The cast is rounded out by dozens of great supporting performances, with Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Greg Wise, Imelda Staunton, Hugh Laurie, Myriam Francois-Serrah, James Fleet, Elizabeth Spriggs, Gemma Jones, Harriet Walter and Imogen Stubbs all giving some of their best work. Ang Lee's direction is pretty much perfect, working with cinematographer Michael Coulter to capture the beauty of the British countryside and the city of London, though it's of course limited to the richer, more privileged lifestyles of its Upper-class Victorians.  Emma Thompson won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it's easy to see why, with great, enjoyable dialogue and a great sense of character and thematic development. If you don't like Jane Austen and Austen-like films (i.e. half of the period dramas that came after this highly influential movie), then you probably won't like this, but it's great for everyone else; a nice, pleasant, genuine piece of escapism.",

            "content": "There's a lot to be said about the popularity of classic English romance. Having never watched more than 20 seconds of Downton Abbey, I can't rightly say that I'm a fan of the genre. I enjoy European films about class, but when the main focus is romance all I see are uptight, overdressed people being silly about their station. It's far more interesting to criticize the objectification of love than to pretend there was any romance during the Romantic Period. While this movie has much wit, I don't see any moral lesson that translates to the modern age.\nWhile none of the main characters pass the Bechdel test, I imagine that's more a sign of the times than a bad script. The only way to move forward in that era was either as a wife or a spinster, so what's a girl to do? However, based on Jane Austen's reputation, I was expecting much more of a fight from these women. Why they fall in love with these men is not obvious, other than the fact they are threatened with poverty. Mr. Willoughby's a Manic Pixie Dream Boy who reads sonnets and snipping lox of hair, and his telegraphed downfall doesn't feel rewarding in any modern feminist context.\nAll that being said, I still found this movie is well written, well acted, well directed, and beautifully designed. Much of the imagery by director Ang Lee evokes memories of oil painted vistas and still-life fruitbowls. The tales is a game of rules and manners; agreements and dishonesty; pheasants and terriers; and it is skillfully crafted. But add all that together what do we have? A story about class struggle that is too frivolous to be truly great.",

I love Emma Thompson as an actor; but she was (and I hate to voice this)-- she was simply too old to play the part of Elinor Dashwood.  Furthermore, Kate Winslet, whom I also respect very much as an actor, was miscast as Marianne Dashwood, capturing neither the magnetism nor volatility of the character-- and hence was not as central within the movie as the book.  She seemed more a secondary, supporting presence in the shadow of Elinor; but the real 'love story' within the book is that between the two sisters, whose individual strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately unconditional love for one another, helps both to endure and even grow through very difficult challenges.  And for this to be delineated, Marianne must have a very strong presence in the story, which seemed lacking for me in the movie.\r\n\r\nContinuing in my picky-ness, Hugh Grant, who would have made a perfect Willoughby, was woefully miscast as Edward Ferrars.  And I have other complaints about the casting, though I am reaching perhaps a point of embarrassment at just how picky I must seem by now ...\r\n\r\nProbably the lesson for me here is that when I watch movies adapted from favorite authors or novels, they just might not go quite as I would have had them!  lol",

            "content": "Before there was \"Price and Prejudice\", there was \"Sense and Sensibility\", so I reckon Jane Austen was pretty big into catchy titles with \"and\" in them early on in her career, as surely as Kate Winslet was pretty big into coming-of-age period dramas early on in her career. I don't know about you people, but I got pretty nervous watching this film, as Winslet was fresh off of the set of the period psychological thriller \"Heavenly Creatures\", and you know what we got in that coming-of-age opus: ...a really bad movie. Winslet's character was pretty crazy in that film, and Peter Jackson was probably even crazier for making the film, but hey, at least this film is decent, which I reckon means that the more overlong and British the period drama featuring Kate Winslet is, the better it ends up being, as Winselt would go on to remind us in that awesome, four-hour-long and outstandingly British \"Hamlet\" in '96. Well, then again, \"Titanic\" is easily her best film, and the closest James Cameron has come to being British is being raised in a place that has a province called British Columbia, and plus, I don't see how this film can get any more British, as it's based on a Jane Austen book, is written by and stars Emma Thompson, also features Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Tom Wilkinson, and is directed by... some Taiwanese dude. Hey, the next film interpretation of \"Sense and Sensibility\" was some Indian musical, so I guess this book is pretty popular in Asia, but then again, \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" is a loose adaptation of this novel, much like most every other post-1995 interpretation of \"Sense and Sensibility\", so this novel couldn't be too popular, or else it would have been adapted, like, 87 times like every other popular, classic dramatic novel of this nature. Hey, this film was such a hit that maybe people didn't want to touch the novel upon which it's based anymore because they knew they could never hope to top it. Ang Lee knows how to get things done, except maybe when it comes to \"Hulk\", though I can't say that I'm nearly as crazy about this film as everyone else seems to be, and quite a few reasons.\r\n\r\nThis type of period drama's is a formula that has been done to death throughout the years, and although we've kind of gotten a bit used to it over time, and although there are some relatively refreshing beats to this particular effort, there's no ignoring the conventionalism to this paint-by-numbers coming-of-age period drama dealing with a young lady trying to defy tradition to take the hand of a man she feels genuine love for, nor is there any denying that this film takes a bit too long of a time to tell such a familiar story. I suppose this film's subject matter warrants something of a hefty length, as there have been decidedly lengthier interpretations of Jane Austen's three-volume lady drama \"epic\", yet whether it be from the lengthy source material or from Emma Thompson's pen, there is much fat around the edges, and they guide the final product to its 136-minute length through aimless filler and repetition that are detrimental to pacing enough of paper, clean of Ange Lee's questionable atmospheric influences. As often as I have been impressed with Lee's storytelling, he has a tendency to incorporate into his film the type of dryness this very formal drama apparently demands, and sure, Lee has proven that he has the impressive ability to put such atmospheric limpness to very good use, yet the fact of the matter is that this film, on top of being bloated, gets to be chilled quiet meandering spells that prove to be bland more often than not, and sometimes prove to be downright dull. There's enough cleverness to Lee's usage of the atmosphere to keep things from getting all that boring, but the quiet coldness in this film proves to be about as supplementary to the limp pacing as it proves to be complimentary to the dry color of this formal fluff piece, which could have stood as rewarding through all of its limp spells if it wasn't so much of what I just said it is: a fluff piece. Nevermind the conventionalism of a story of this type, Austen's source material just doesn't have a whole lot of meat or consequence to its conflicts, being sharp and all, but with too much minimalism for it to appear to be something that could easily be made into the rewarding opus that this film is sadly not sharp enough to be. That being said, the film is carried almost to a rewarding state on the shoulders of endearing charm, backed by plenty of genuinely commendable strengths, but you're given too much to think about the natural shortcomings of this minimalist and formulaic drama by overdrawn cold spells for underwhelmingness to be kept at bay. Regardless, the final product is quite enjoyable, being seriously flawed, but competent enough areas to entertain adequately, and do so with a tastefulness that can even be found clear as day within the musical aspects.\r\n\r\nI've always found Patrick Doyle to be a rather underappreciated and excellent score composer who may not boast too much originality to his musical visions, but has an exceptional classical style that breathes a lot of life into his projects, including this one, for although the many quiet spells of this film silence Doyle's efforts in more places than it should, when the music finally kicks back in, it's hard not to be particularly engrossed, as Doyle bonds very 19th century elegance and relatively modernist fluffiness within a thoroughly colorful classical score that proves to be hauntingly beautiful and highly complimentary to the establishment of a feel for the era portrayed in this classical period piece. Needless to say, an even more recurring and thorough component to the immersion value of this period piece is Philip Elton's and Andrew Sanders' exceptional art direction, which, with the help of Luciana Arrighi's intricate production designs and Jenny Beavan's and John Bright's costume designs, restores the Georgian era of England with a subtly detailed eye that catches your eye and thrusts you into a distinguished world, but not without being down-to-earth enough to thoroughly convince. Very tasteful and clever with its celebration of lovely music and lively production value, this fairly well-produced film is at least rewarding on an artistic level, immersing you into the setting of this period piece, while the acting helps in immersing you into the depths of the more human aspects of this drama. There is, of course, very little in the way of heavy dramatic material for this talented cast to play with, and without that kind of acting demand which keeps the performers alert, acting in films of this nature usually fail to hold enough inspiration for you to look at the characters as anything more than types, yet in this case, while the performances aren't outstanding, most everyone makes sure to make his or her character particularly memorable through colorfully distinguished charisma that sells you on the characters, while excellent chemistry sells you on the relationships that define the characters and their story. Disregarding the occasional emotionally powered dramatic note, the performers aren't exactly able to anchor the dramatic punch that could have made this film truly rewarding, but they do carry many aspects of this fairly human character piece, though cannot be enough to bring the final product close to a rewarding level. What truly secures the considerable decency and borderline bona fide goodness of this film, is, of course, the storytelling, or at least the highlights within the formulaic, overlong and dry storytelling, such as a cleverness to Emma Thompson's score that captures the wit of Jane Austen's classic novel, but settles down the romanticism enough for you to connect a bit to the sharp dialogue and humor, often in an amusing way, resulting in a fair degree of color that director Ang Lee augments, at least up to a point, as his dry atmosphere all too often blands things up, but is just as often appropriate enough for a formal fluff piece of this type for you to soak up the cold color that defines the endearing charm of this period drama. If the film is nothing else, it is thoroughly charming, and while that's certainly not enough to make a strong film, it certainly deserves credit for bringing the film close to a rewarding state, joining tasteful artistic value and good acting in making the final product reasonably entertaining, if improvable.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film tells a formulaic tale, and does so in an overlong, repetitious fashion that is made all the more relatively grating by a bland atmospheric dryness which leaves you to meditate upon the inconsequentiality of this drama, which ultimately sputters out as underwhelming, but just barely, being supported enough by a loveliness to music, immersive intricacy to cinematography, charisma to acting, and dry color to sharp writing and direction for Ang Lee's \"Sense and Sensibility\" to stand as a pretty enjoyable, if held back interpretation of a Jane Austen classic.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",
