But after that first act, I managed to put together what was going on and what everyone was doing and after that, it was smooth sailing. \n\nThe rest of the movie turned into a pulse-pounding thriller that not only had an excellent cat-and-mouse dynamic but also explored interesting concepts like the similar effect being a dedicated criminal and cop have on their personal lives and the heavy sacrifices they must take in order to do what they do best.

He can brilliantly stage an armored car robbery or daytime bank heist--action scenes that crackle with urgency, immediacy, and excitement. But Mann understands that a thriller has to EARN its thrills. That's where this superb crime thriller stands above most. The gripping drama that serves as filler in between the action is what makes this 3-hour L.A. epic fly by. De Niro and Pacino give the cop/criminal two-sides-of-the-same-coin theme its juice, and make the cat-and-mouse stuff fascinating. The supporting cast is terrific--Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Danny Trejo, all of whom fill their roles solidly. Mann's dialogue is often flinty and has a manly poetry to it, and his plotting is airtight. The scene when Pacino and De Niro finally share the screen together is one for the books. \"Classic\" is the only way to describe it. This slick and very, very cool crime thriller delivers the pulse-pounding action we expect, but its Mann's brilliant drama that really makes the heart race here. And that's what makes this rank with the great crime thrillers of 90s",

Robert de Niro y Al Pacino están increíbles; solo basta ver la escena del café, una escena con un suspense espectacular y con un manejo de diálogos increíble. el guion de esta película es perfecto. Cada línea te cuenta algo de cada personaje o de entorno que los rodea, con planos que le dan esa profundidad y sentimiento a la película. En conforme avanza la película puedes notar el impacto que tuvo en una generación de guionistas y directores, muchas escenas hasta el día de hoy siguen inspirando. Las escenas de acción tienen un gran manejo en su estructura combinando de muy buena manera la acción con el suspenso y hasta el drama; porque te encariñas con los personajes, no te gustaría que a ninguno le pasara nada. Solo bastaron unas pocas palabras para entenderlos, sin escenas sentimentales forzadas o escenas explicativas; el director maneja esta película esperando que el espectador le siga el hilo a la trama.

But a more thoughtful review recently meant that I also noticed some details that I may have forgiven on the first viewing when I was caught up in all the exciting crime action. For example, the film's over length or the fact there are so many characters it's hard to keep track. Also, that set-piece shoot-out after the bank robbery which, although well done technically, is so chaotically over the top it might fit more appropriately these days in an Expendables movie (when I thought about it, the bank robbery itself looked like the approach of a bunch of wild-ass amateurs with automatic weapons and ski-masks rather than a seasoned group of skilled professionals De Niro's character was supposed to command)! These flaws didn't seriously affect my overall enjoyment of the other pleasures of the film, but they did prevent me from acknowledging it was as good as I remember.",

I loved it at the time, with a caveat - that there was something about the way the female characters were presented that unsettled me. With learning accrued in the intervening years, I can flesh that out a little - the females all speak truth to or about me, or reveal it to them. The truth is almost always about the men themselves. All of this means that the women end up paying the cost and bearing the brunt of the men's actions, men whose response to the truth is to ignore, to double-down, kick back at it. That may be realistic - this is a very (toxic) male trait, and it leaves us with the question of if Mann does this consciously or if it's his own fault, too. Viewed in the context of his other work, it's hard to feel it's not a fault - most female characters in Mann's films have little or no agency for themselves, existing only for or in relation to men. For a filmmaker of such insight and brilliance, it's a striking fault. Otherwise, Heat is brilliant - just think, though, how shining that brilliance could be if the women were allowed agency.",

More like lukewarm\" or \"I ordered this with some Heat and instead got mild\" or \"Heat needs a minute in the microwave.\" Those are things I'm NOT going to say. However, maybe the cast and concept (and Val Kilmer's killer ponytail) set a high bar for this L.A.-based crime drama. Now, a (76) is nothing to sneeze at, but a 170-minute runtime is a big ask for this style of film and I think it hurt it in the end. I rarely make this critique, but does it have too much character development? I found Neil's (De Niro) story hackneyed even for 1995. In fact, the three main storylines — Chris (Kilmer) and Lt. Hanna (Pacino) — all to be pretty par for the time; custody arguments, bored housewife not getting enough attention, suicidal teenager, etc., etc. It's not that these plotlines shouldn't be done, but cut some of it in your almost 3-hour movie. The good here though is really good. Pacino is VERY Pacino. Like, if you had to pick one Pacino performance to show a blank-slate quintessential (stereotypical) Pacino, I think you could make the argument for Heat. (The other two I'd argue are Serpico or Scent of a Woman). Another reason to come for Heat is the shootout scene on the street in broad daylight. It's is simply fantastic. I knew about this scene long before ever watching the movie and I suppose expected more of this stuff than what I got. It also felt like a complete waste of good Jon Voight. If it cut a little more of the fat I think Heat would've been a mid to high-80s for me. Nevertheless, it's a must-watch for Pacino fans and ponytail aficionados.",

It features a memorable score as well. And for the crime genre, this must've been quite revolutionary for the time, I can tell that this movie inspired many other big budget, high-profile heist movies, like The Inside Man (2006) or The Town (2010), and even video games like the Grand Theft Auto series. \nAnd yet, it felt shallow to me in the end. And the reason for why this is quite mediocre is the script. I didn't any reason as to why this pic should've been almost three hours, there's a lot of unnecessary elements that are added to the film, and I'd actually say that there's too much development to it. It feels like it's a badly constructed, hit-and-miss project. And there for I found this apparently very well received classic to be boring sometimes. It's got its moments here and there, but the script can not lift the movie into the status of actually being a very good movie. \nOverall, Heat is a mediocre crime movie, and it only made the time pass...",

Thankfully, for the most part, it did. Remaking his own TV movie with then acting gods Al Pacino and Robert De Niro sharing the screen for the first time, Michael Mann doesn't disappoint with this 171min sprawling epic, pitting Pacino's Vincent Hanna, an almost stereotypically resolute police detective who excels at work but a mess in his personal life, against De Niro's Neil McCauley, the ruthless but gentlemanly criminal mastermind who heads a gang of vicious bank robbers. A slickly executed heist on an armoured vehicle opens the film and sets the tone but it's its dense plotting, with 4-5 storylines criss-crossing each other that's most impressively handled. Even though parts of it would be deemed superfluous nowadays (I'm looking at you, Waingro, and your serial killing tendencies) and most female characters here are sketchily drawn as girlfriends and wives (it's the 90s, after all), the cat-and-mouse gameplay between the crews and between Hanna and McCauley is deliciously and meticulously plotted, as they're poignantly portrayed as two sides mirroring each other in more ways than one. Mann's sumptuous and stylishly composed film pops, especially at night when he's let loose under Los Angeles' mesmerizing city of lights, as he ratchets up tension, building to that famous scene at the cafe where two actors at their zenith finally come face to face and it's as magnificent and unforgettable as you'd expect. Though I must confess, that scene aside, Pacino's penchant for shouting his lines in his signature bugged-eyed exaggerated manner, already starts to grate; leaving a small blemish on a classic of its genre that has otherwise stood the test of time.",

Women served one functionality - either to be fucked or seen as an attempt at some stability.  Why rob a bank that you know is already being staked out by the police?  Why stay in an area and try and rob anything when you know you've been made by the police?  Why not spend most of your time finding the guy you failed to kill and has the potential to make you all?  Why do all the hard labour of making a girl give up her career and entire life to go on the run with you just to let your ego take over and get you killed? I don't understand male ego.  Why get married if you don't give a fuck about spending time with your wife? Why risk not only your life but someone you claim to love to double back for some guy you could've killed before but failed to and never thought about again until the end of the movie?  Shows how one dimensional intelligence can be and how easy it is to have blind spots in every other area in life.\n\nAh, and this whole \"don't have anything you can't walk out on in 30 seconds or less\" bullshit was violated a hundred times over.

And there many other cringe-worthy lines). \n\nThe cops and crooks are all alpha males; the women are all brainless bimbos--especially DeNiro's girlfriend who, in spite of being a normal \"civilian,\" decides to stick with him even after she discovers that's he's a thief and a murderer. This is after about two dates. Good choice, lady. \n\nTo make matters worse, the movie is interminable: two hours and 49 minutes. \n\nThere's plenty of automatic weapons fire, scores of wrecked vehicles, and many gallons of blood, if you like that kind of thing. \n\nEveryone at the time of the film's release was all hyped to see DeNiro and Pacino together as a bad guy and a cop, but to me, there is no chemistry. The one scene in which they meet in a restaurant and talk is promising, but it falls flat. They recite their lines and try to make it convincing, but that particular moment in the film made me realize how little investment they had in these roles. Just two big time actors collecting their paychecks. \n\nThe 2 1/2 star Tomatometer rating sums it up for me: \"Meh, it passed the time.\" Nearly three very slow hours of it. ",

I still think that the high points of this movie make up for any of its slower parts big time, along with some killer performances. Pacino admitted that his character is supposed to be on coke the whole movie, and De Niro's character is a former Marine if you watch closely. These little nuances make \"Heat\" awesome. The bank robbery scene is legendary, and was even used by the USMC to teach recruits about combat tactics. I'm a former infantry Marine, so of course I think that's badass. This movie is a must-see if you like action/mob/crime movies. ",

            "content": "The best heist film ever made.\n\nMichael Mann's crime drama Heat (1995) is a blistering heist film filled with thoughtful character introductions and development, a shocking robbery, a tense heist, a exciting shootout, and a gripping finale. Heat has been endlessly ripped off, but never surpassed or matched. Heat has clearly inspired probably every crime film after it as its effect is constantly felt. From the deep character study of its complex criminal and police characters to its brutal shootout and intricate heist. Heat is an all time great whose impact continues to be felt today.\n\nHeat is Michael Mann taking everything he learned as a director from Thief and Manhunter and elevating into this masterpiece of criminal masterminds and police ingenuity. Mann slowly makes you care about each character on both sides of the law, then takes them away from you one by one. the truck robbery is so shocking and cool that you are immediately engrossed by Heat's ambitious criminality and masterful direction. Mann keeps you right with the gang during the shootout in a hail of bullets like no other. I do not know what exactly is so perfect about the bank shootout, but it works on every level. The sudden tragedy, the human casualties, the loud gunfire, the endless stream of machine gun fire, or the constant chase aspect all culminate in an exhilarating and frightening shootout like I have never seen topped in any other film. Mann tops himself within Heat with his airport finale with a gripping chase that leads into a film noir shootout under the night sky. Heat is simply immaculately directed by Michael Mann.\n\nRobert De Niro is awesome as Neil, a criminal mastermind, who think of everything beforehand with devastating results. Together with a hyper focused Al Pacino as police homicide detective Vincent, they capture Heat's justice dynamic with a sympathetic viewpoint into each side of the law. They are both cool and hilarious at several points in Heat, especially their coffee chat in a restaurant and the airport finale. They represent a hero hellbent on ending a crime spree while struggling to maintain his marriage in Pacino's Vincent and a villain gouging out the heart of morality while trying to find genuine love in De Niro's Neil. De Niro desperately wants out and a new life with Amy Brenneman's kindly, yet naive Eade, while Pacino's Vincent wants a fresh start with his wife Justine, played by the fierce and direct Diane Venora. The duality of Pacino and De Niro's roles is fascinating unto itself in Heat. Heat is some of De Niro and Pacino's finest character acting.\n\nVal Kilmer is a rush of energy as he guns down men from afar with unbelievable results. Kilmer's carnage in Heat is just unreal and has to be seen to be believed. Kilmer's Chris even gets a sympathetic side as his marriage has fallen apart like Pacino's character Vincent's own predicament. Alongside the lovely Ashley Judd as the fed up Charlene, Val Kilmer gives a strong heart to an adrenaline rush of a villain.\n\nLikewise, Tom Sizemore's blackhearted Michael is a likable family man and another professional seeking a thrilling heist to sate his criminal urges even at the cost of the innocent. Similarly, Kevin Gage is unforgettable as the repulsive monster Waingro. You will feel unsettled at the very least by Waingro's presence.\n\nJon Voight is solid and intriguing as Neil's mysterious contact Nate. Natalie Portman is devastating and adorable in Heat as Pacino's step-daughter Lauren. Wes Studi has a supporting role as one of Pacino's steadfast cops Casals like Ted Levine's Bosko. I really liked Tom Noonan's short cameo as Kelson. Dennis Haysbert, Hank Azaria, William Fichtner, Henry Rollins, Susan Traylor, and Danny Trejo all have neat smaller roles too in Heat. Overall, Heat's cast is outstanding and fun.\n \nElliot Goldenthal's score is a dreamy musical accompaniment to the dark L.A. nighttime backdrop. Heat is full of dimly lit rooms and carefully silhouetted figures. Goldenthal's premier moment is in the finale as he scores a beautiful piece while Pacino looks distant in the airport's fields against the bleak sky. Dante Spinotti's cinematography beautiful represents L.A. nightlife with piercing imagery and mesmerizing shots. Every shot of a face or gun feels deliberate and worthwhile. Heat is just a masterful display of filmmaking all around.\n\nIn all, Heat is a must see film for Michael Mann's ambitious and epic direction with a ton of immaculate cogs in the corrupt clockwork of Heat.",

            "content": "I knew Michael Mann primarily as the creative force behind Miami Vice, a 1980s cop procedural that is very of it's time, that is why I was hesitant to watch this film despite the great cast and all of the positive reviews it received. I was pleasantly surprised on watching it that it lived up to the hype and was the brilliant blend of character study and breathtaking action scenes that I had been promised. After seeing this I am willing to be more adventurous with my choice in films and not disqualify a film immediate because it's classified as a crime/drama, this is a film that's as much about the personal relationships of the characters as the story of cop vs. criminals.\n\nNeil McCauley, Robert De Niro, acts as a robber whose latest mission is to steal $1.6 million from an armored car. To do this he needs the help of his underlings, chief among them the struggling Chris Shiherlis, Val Kilmer, while his new recruit Waingro, Kevin Gage, is impulsive and reckless and accidentally shoots a guard during the robbery causing problems for Neal. The man investigating Neal is Vincent Hanna, Al Pacino, who fails in his first attempt to have Neal's crew arrested. Neal unwisely decides to undertake one last heist, the usual, in order to have enough money to retire. The men's personal lives complicate their professional as Chris's ex-wife Charlene, Ashley Judd, wants to split from him, Vincent's wife Justine, Diane Venora, falls out of love with him while her daughter Lauren, Natalie Portman, faces her own struggles and Neal falls for the young and impressionable Eady, Amy Brenneman.\n\nI am generally not into action films because I find the scenes of action to be repetitive and dull but here they are exhilarating and tense. The first robbery in particularly is exciting and helps you understand why men would become addicted to this lifestyle. Mann is famed for his ability to incorporate music and â~MTV-aesthetics' into his action scenes and he does that expertly here as all of the super stylized moments of Neal and Vincent facing off while Chris carries out dangerous tasks are oddly beautiful to watch. Spatial awareness is focused upon and I felt aware of where everybody was positioned during the robberies and the climactic shootout so unlike in a Michael Bay film I remained invested throughout instead of feeling numbed to the monotony of the scenes. The only thing that I feared after watching the film was that I have developed a taste for violence which I have never previously had and although this will allow me to enjoy a lot of films more it may not be the morally correct thing to believe.\n\nThe actions scenes are a lot better than 99% of what is found in action films but the film that puts Heat above the rest is it's engagement in the personal lives of it's characters. Vincent is seen to be a poor husband but a good father figure for his stepdaughter as her own father neglects her and this complexity allows for us to root for him while also understanding the toll that his job takes on him. Meanwhile we see Neal, a hardened criminal, fall in love with a woman for what seems like the first time in a long time. Although the romantic dialogue isn't exactly Nora Ephron-level it is believable that Neal wouldn't be a funny charmer and their bond isn't necessarily based on their great conversational skills. Finally, Chris's relationship with Charlene ends on an emotionally poignant note as she allows him to escape from police capture, the look that transpires between Kilmer and Judd says it all. The contrasting between Neal and Vincent occurs throughout but here it is done more lightly than in other parts of the film.\n\nThe central conflict of the film ends dramatically as the two decide they are so devoted to their jobs that they will give up everything in order to take down their adversary. Throughout we see that their actions and behaviors resemble one another and a respect develops between the two of them even as their only desire appears to be to take down the other. Seeing De Niro and Pacino face off in a scene where they discuss their personal philosophies is as exciting as it should be as they deliver their lines in their typical dramatic fashion and although throughout they don't completely â~disappear' into their roles who doesn't want to see two of the great actors of the 20th century commiserate.\n\nThis is definitely a film that you should watch, especially if you're not usually into this type of film, for the writing, treatment of characters and exciting action scenes. This would be one of the best action or crime/drama films I have ever seen and it is nice to have old tropes from classic films updated and made more digestible.",

This is because they are played perfectly. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, two of the best actors of all time, play off of each other very well and deliver stellar performances, as usual. Val Kilmer also shines along with Tom Sizemore. The atmospheric presence is also there, it has a feel like Blade Runner with the score echoing the mood and atmosphere of scenes where people are just staring, driving or thinking, it's really engaging.

But I remembered good things about it, and my wife had never seen it, so I thought it was high time to revisit, even if it is almost 3 hours long. And I'm really glad I did. The characters make sense, the direction is really slick, and most astonishingly of all, it never feels long. Everything in it leads logically from the last thing and into the next. Why is it so easy to root for a criminal with some kind of moral code? It really doesn't take a lot, and I'm entirely on board. Everyone loves a thief, I guess. Ok, fine, the love story element of it isn't entirely believable, but it's not a love story type of film and it's already long so I understand why they keep it shortish and hope that you jump on board with a love-at-first-sight vibe. Pacino is probably a shade over the top for me (apparently earlier drafts had his character have a cocaine problem, which was cut but still seems to have informed his performance) but Robert De Niro is so cool in this it hurts. It's in that amazing mid nineties run of his with Jackie Brown, Sleepers, Casino and Ronin. I could continue to gush, but I won't. Just listen when I say that one of my most common criticisms of a film is that it's too long, and yet I think this 170 minute film is awesome. Also, what happened to Tom Sizemore?",

This is Michael Mans's Los Angeles- incredibly stylish full of thieves and mules wearing suits and ray bans.

            "content": "Heat is, without doubt, one of the finest crime dramas ever put to film. It's so painfully close to perfection it's silly. On the surface it's the story of a cop and a robber as they play a game of cat and mouse with one another on the streets of LA. But Heat isn't satisfied with that and pries deeper. We delve into the personal relationships of these two men; their romantic engagements, their friends, and how they choose to spend their spare time. As such the film manages to turn into a character study, and make a point about masculinity in the process.\n\nNeil McCauley heads up a tight-knit group of professional criminals who finds himself in a sticky situation when a new guy inadvertently screws up their latest heist. He has to find a way to pay off a stock broker while dodging the heat gained from the cops. It gets complicated further when he meets a young book store clerk who peels back his tough outer shell to reveal a softer side to him. His mantra of never having connections starts to fall apart, as he sees the joy and life his friends enjoy from their families. He comes to the realisation that being a professional criminal is not the life he wants to lead, and sets up one final job. Meanwhile Vincent Hanna is on his tail. He's a dedicated police lieutenant who puts his job before anything else, including his own family. He has trouble keeping relationships as his third marriage starts to fall apart. As he closes in on McCauley's crew, he finds himself outsmarted and thwarted at almost every step. He's finally ready to give up entirely when a family tragedy pushes him back down the rabbit hole.\n\nIt's not just the main characters that enjoy such depth either. McCauley's crew enjoys choice selections of character development that really gets you rooting for them too. Chris, for example, is a gambling addict who does these jobs to pay off his debts, much to the chagrin of his wife who seeks to leave him at every opportunity, even though there is still love between them. Michael is a family man who can't give it up because he loves the thrill. As he says, he's in it for the juice. Even Donald, an ex-con on parole who's stuck working a shitty job under a shitty boss and has to swallow his pride until Neil comes along and offers him a better deal, showing that ex-cons are often given such a hard time that they end up just reverting back to what they know.\n\n\nBut Heat is also about the women in these men's lives. Justine yearns for Vincent to be more present, and to share her with his job rather than constantly feeling like the leftovers. His step-daughter Lauren is going through a hard time with her absent father, tackling a depression that goes unseen and ignored until it's almost too late. Charlene is Chris' former sex worker wife who's clued in on Chris' extra curricula activities and loves him as much as she resents him for it; willing to throw him under the bus one moment, and save his ass the next. Eady is the new woman in Neil's life who manages to change his worldview and soften him up, but simply doesn't know enough and is unwittingly thrust into a world she is unequipped for.\n\nThe fact I can talk at length about the large cast of characters is testament to how much of Heat is dedicated for character building. It all works and it draws you into their world as people. They become friends and enemies, people you love and people you hate, people you root for and care about. The dialogue is cleverly crafted to help the characters articulate their thoughts and feelings without feeling like exposition. It's fluid, snappy, and natural in a way that makes it easy to listen to, without being too overbearing with the metaphors and the philosophical jargon that dialogue-heavy movies like to flirt with.\n\nBut the dialogue is nothing without some exceptional acting behind it. This is without doubt my favourite Al Pacino performance. He's so enthusiastic about it, and every word jumps out of his mouth without a beat. He manages to say so much with a look in his eye or the emergence of a smirk, before he even opens his mouth. His level of improv also helps of course, creating moments of spontaneity that keeps his supporting cast on their toes. De Niro is his equal in this movie more than any other, giving Neil that cool, calm, calculating edge that juxtaposes nicely against Pacino's more erratic Vincent. The scene they share together is maybe not as electric as you might hope, or others might lead you to believe, but it's still a pretty great scene just for the nature of these two guys sat opposite each other, leading very different, but at the same time very similar lives, sparring off.\n\nThe supporting cast is all great as well, and looking back it's one of the finest castlists assembled. Val Kilmer gives Chris the humanity needed to make him a likeable character, Tom Sizemore doesn't get a whole lot to do as Michael, but his family-man character in for the thrill comes out in every scene. Jon Voight, Danny Trejo, Tom Noonan, and Dennis Haysbert round out the crew, with a foil from William Fichtner, and family from Ashley Judd to Amy Brenneman. The other half of the supporting crew is made up of the likes of Wes Studi, Ted Levine, and Mykelti Williamson as Hanna's team, while Diane Venora and none other than Natalie Portman make up his family life. There's also small scenes for Henry Rollins, Xander Berkeley, Jeremy Piven, and Hank Azaria too. This level of castlist will likely never be assembled ever again.\n\nFinally I can't write a review about Heat without talking about the bank robbery, which ranks as possibly the greatest shootout ever put to film. Oh man this scene is intense, from the way it builds up in the bank all the way to the last shots. The key to it's intensity is the sound. On a normal volume setting allowing you to hear all the dialogue, this scene is deafening. The gunshots echo throughout the streets at such a volume and intensity that it puts you right there. Each shot is drawn out by the ambient sounds around it. If you want to watch a movie that makes you feel like you're in the middle of a firefight, this scene is the one, with some of the most accurate gunshot sounds in Hollywood. The approach to ambient sounds is one that prevails through the whole film, grounding it and putting you right into the thick of it in every scene, whether it's a hail of gunfire, or birds tweeting in the murky dawn.\n\nHeat is just so good on every level. If you want deep, involving characters, Heat has you covered. If you want intense action scenes that are so gritty and realistic you feel like you're there, Heat has you covered. You want a tale of morality on two sides of the law, given equal importance, Heat has you covered. You want a fantastic score emphasising captivating cinematography, Heat has you covered. You want to watch two of Hollywood's heavyweights hold a conversation, Heat has you covered. The only thing preventing me from giving Heat a perfect 10/10 is it's length and pacing. In order to squeeze so much character development in, it starts to drag a little bit in the middle. It's not enough to make you bored or ruin the whole experience, but when it jumps from one dramatic conversation to another without a break, it starts to feel longer than it should. That's really just a nitpick though. I give Heat a fantastic 9/10 without hesitation.\n\nhttp://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",

            "content": "This is one film I consider to be an absolute masterpiece, coming in right at the top of its genre and has stayed there quite happily among it's fans. It's Christopher Nolan's favourite film, which is quite a statement and was his inspiration for creating the Dark Knight's Gotham. But what makes this one of the most highly regarded thrillers in cinema history? Was it the clashing of two massive names in Hollywood, a selling point that was heavily marketed? Or is it the artistry or the explosive action? The story itself maybe? Or probably what it's most likely to be, is the perfect amalgamation of all of these keys elements that make this such a grand piece of cinema. \n\nI was lucky enough to catch Heat on it's opening weekend at Odeon 1, Leicester Square back in 1996. An unforgettable experience seeing two of my favourite actors going head to head, I immediately fell in love with the film seeing it multiple times after whilst it remained on the big screens. But it wasn't until long after the film's release when I started to take a deeper interest in the film and the people behind it. \n\nMichael Mann had previously earned his reputation as a director with successful films like The Last of The Mohicans, Thief and Hannibal Lector's first screen appearance in Manhunter but it's fair to say, his name as director wasn't remembered as well as names like Spielberg or Scorsese. It wasn't until Heat that really put Mann in the spotlight. \n\nThe story, script and screenplay was written by Mann himself, years before he even turned it into the TV movie, L.A. Takedown in 1989; which was possibly going to be a pilot for a TV saga much like his previously produced series, Miami Vice, making this in affect, a remake of his own film. Much of the TV film was watered-down, cutting a lot away from the original story and it wasn't until producer Art Linston read the full script and encourage Mann to make the big picture, big. With Heat being nearly 3hours long, it's almost double the length of the TV film indicating just how much was chopped away from the original story. \n\nBut what is probably more surprising to fans than this being a remake, is that the character's are actually based on real people. Robert De Niro's character, Neil McCauley was in fact a real life professional score taker from Chicago, having already served 25 years in prison with 8 of those years spent in Alcatraz and half of that in solidarity confinement. Al Pacino's Vincent Hanna was based on a former Chicago Detective and good friend of Mann, Chuck Adamson, who actually had a similar conversation with the real life McCauley to the one we encounter in the coffee shop scene. Though it's only the idea of the them that form the basis of the characters. The rest is built by the behaviours layered on by Pacino and De Niro. \n\nIt's these two characters that brings this film together, but it's so much more than a 'cops and robbers' movie. The character development for both of these was incredible and alluring, having such a dynamic, it was hard for the audience to dislike either, respecting both characters equally making it impossible to decide who you wanted to lose in the end. \n\nThere's an interesting contrast between the two, with De Niro's McCauley being cool, reserved and careful, disciplined by a self-committed and militant ideal where as Pacino's Hanna is relentless, insatiable and unhinged at times and on the verge of being obsessed. But both being equally good at what they do, both bearing a passionate sense of duty as oppose to just being a job and surprisingly, honourably, they share a level of respect and admiration for one another. \n\nPitting two of the greatest tough guy actors against one another for the first time was quite the exciting spectacle. Yes, they were both in The Godfather: Part II, but they never shared a scene and Heat puts them together in one of the most iconic dialogue pieces in recent cinema history. That coffee shop scene was unrehearsed, a strong suggestion from De Niro so to enforce the unfamiliarity between the two. \n\nThe script was brilliant. Powerful, smart, often poetic at times and totally non-judgemental allowing the audience to relate to all of the characters to some degree. This was empowered by having the story encroach on the character's personal lives, their relationships making each of them very human. It's this complex melding of characters that make the story so rich which actually raises some interesting issues, particular the reformation of ex-convicts trying to return to society. Matters of the heart including the impact of the relationships of both sides of the law and what you are prepare to sacrifice. The choices we make, that balance of risk versus reward, regret versus promise, dealing with the consequences and living with the decisions we make. All of this from an action thriller. \n\nIt doesn't necessarily glorify criminals but it does provide an intriguing, and possible attractive look at the criminal underworld, the network of people and the honour among thieves. It's difficult to not admire the heists they pull off, their proficiency and intellect. You don't feel any less admiration for Hanna's Major Crime Unit, as they steadily try to close in on the gang. \n\nThe action is precise and tactical. The L.A. shoot out being incredibly intense in the cinema with the most realistic and deafening sound of gunfire and bullets hitting glass and metal. You're immersed into the scene; it's a rush; there's no hesitation, it's fast, slick and super exciting with some slow motion used only for dramatic effect. Mann wanted everything to be authentic and this included the cast's handling of the firearms used throughout the film. Former SAS Sgt. and novelist, Andy McNab served as technical advisor for the film, training the cast to shoot targets with live ammunition. It certainly worked, as Kilmer's clip-change during a shoot-out is used as an example by the US Marine Corp; much to Kilmer's ecstatic appreciation. \n\nMann's quest of authenticity didn't stop there. They researched real people relating to their character's as much as possible which involved Pacino and unit to wine and dine with some of LAPD's finest, going out on patrols. De Niro's gang visited convicted professional criminals in prison and also dined with some of LA's underworld. Even Ashley Judd and Diane Verona spent time interviewing wives of cops and robbers to gain insight of the characters they would be playing. \n\nAnd to add to all this authenticity, Mann refrained from ever using a soundstage and filmed the film entirely on location, scouting key plots of Los Angeles that would serve as the stage for his story. Some of the scenes actually being filmed in undesirable locations such as a real illegal cockfighting yard that had neighbouring chop shops and the bank robbery sequence was filmed during the weekend. The coffee shop used for that famous scene was filmed in a real restaurant in Beverley Hills with the staff serving as extras; and fans could reserve that very same table at the Kate Mantilini, but sadly the restaurant closed in June 2014. (That was one for the bucketlist) \n\nThe city itself was very much a character in this film, the bloody arena which our characters will fight over. But amongst the violence are those moments of reflection and ambience with stunning shots showing the city's night scape. When I was doing my art A-Level, I choose to study art in film with McCauley's beach house scene being a prime example. I actually did an oil pastel picture of this particular and little did I know that that specific shot was inspired by Alex Colville's 1967 painting \"Pacific\" and is almost an exact copy. \n\nThis atmospheric scenery is solidified with an amazing score and soundtrack. One I bought immediately after my first viewing. It's my favourite work of Elliot Goldenthal, who created a tense and experimental score that is so different throughout. Going from sorrowful strings to almost horrifying ascending strings with a haunting guitar; and then there's the industrial crescendo at the bank job. The soundtrack too, was truly amazing introducing me to a number of artists that I now adore. Lisa Gerrard of Gladiator fame being one of them, this film making me buy all her earlier work. I instantly fell in love with the ambient bluesy sound of Norwegian guitarist Terje Rypdal with his tracks \"Mystery Man\" and \"Last Nite\", musician innovator Michael Brook provides his \"Ultramarine\" track and if you listen carefully, you might recognise his invented Infinite Guitar sound, an instrument used by U2's The Edge most notably on their track \"With or Without You.\" U2 also appearing on the soundtrack with their song \"Always Forever Now\" and let's not forget the two Moby tracks used which was the strangely uplifting and sobering \"God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters\" and his more rockier \"New Dawn Fades\" \n\nWith an intricate story, powerhouse performances, incredible action sequences, attention to detail and a brilliant soundtrack, this will always remain as one of, of not the best crime thriller of all time. It's one of the rare gems where audiences are divided by who they want to win, some, like myself, never actually deciding. It's a grand example of the love and craftsmanship that's provided by a director who directing his own story as oppose to filming someone else's. It's Mann's Iliad, an epic crime saga, his best film to date and will always be the film he'll be remembered for. \n\nRunning Time: 10\nThe Cast: 10\nPerformance: 10\nDirection: 10\nStory: 10\nScript: 9\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 10\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being the definitive crime thriller that just gets everything right. \n\n99% 10/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

Sure this occasionally puts the action on hold, but when it picks back up, somehow your connection enhances the heart-stopping effect when 12 gauges start firing.

There is an ambiance/atmosphere/feel to the movie that just sucks you right in. It is grounded with full characters unpredictable and for those expecting a heavily-packed action movie are going to be dissapointed. This movie isn't one to sit back an eat popcorn. This sucks you right and takes up your full attention, with the talking scenes just as suspensful and intriguing as the action. It is almost as if the direction is aimed for action allthroughout. One thing that I adored that this movie does is it is symmetrical almost. There is literal symmetry in alot of shots and in the plot itself. This is to represent how similar the two characters really are, they appear to be opposite ends of the spectrum but in reality are just a fine line away between each other. The supporting cast is great which I also like as it is easy to just focus on these two characters but there are other arcs, making the characters and the stakes even more real. My FAVOURITE part of this movie is how it never presents a character to you and makes you like him and root for him. It is as I said, a symmetrical film. In the suspensful moments I was on the edge holding my breath, as I love both the \"good\" guys and the \"bad\" guys but in reality in the film there are no good or bad guys, just two sides you both love. Drawing all these points together heat is a masterful, dialogue driven movie with amazing action set peices when it comes to them, great cinematography, well rounded characters and a must watch. The only flaw I have is that it took a bit of time for me to really get 100% interested but apart from that the run time doesn't feel long at all. It is definetly worth a watch.",

In the process of the heist, Waingro impulsively kills a guard.  Waingro clearly an unknown quantity and obviously a psychotic was clearly a mistake the crew realise much too late.  McCauley in particular is full of rage and attempts to dispose of Waingro but fails.\n\nIntensely dedicated and hungry senior Police Officier Lt Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) assigned to the case instantly recognises this is not the work of a bunch of amatuers and this is a professionally focused crew that he intends to take down.  McCauley's fence Nate suggests that they can sell the bonds back to it's owner, a money launderer by the name of Van Zant (William Fitchner).  Van Zant agrees but intends to teach them a lesson for stealing from him, although Zant is unaware how careful McCauley and crew are and when the attempt is foiled, McCauley vows revenge and chillingly intones to Zant that he's a dead man with a piece of the most memorable dialogue from the film. \n\nHanna in the process of investigating the crew grows to admire McCauley and his professionalism despite determined to bring him to justice, leading to a meeting in the now famous coffee shop sequence of the film. Waingro emerges to assist Van Zant in finding McCauley and his crew before they can get to him. Events are put in place as the film including an earth shuddering and visceral gun battle to end all gun battles pursues to it's sombre and emotionally charged ending.\n\nAs someone who was priviledged to have caught Heat on the original UK theatrical release (1996) I remember anticipating it greatly for the pedigree on display but not really quite ready for what I saw. My reason for revisiting this film  I was lucky enough to see recently a new digital restoration of this film.  This is something the film had desperately needed, even the much improved Blu ray presentation was not without issues. I'm happy to say that this version that was premiered recently at the Academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theatre followed by a Q&A chaired by super fan Christopher Nolan who fielded questions to the attending cast and crew including Mann, De Niro, Pacino and cinematogrpaher Dante Spinotti amongst others is finally a fitting enough version of this much influential masterwork. The dialogue issues have been sorted and the 4K treatment has done nothing to alter it's film like appearance, no digital scrubbing evident here.\n\nHeat certainly didn't echo anything that the decade had previously given us within the cop thriller genre.  This absorbing meditation of crime with it's richly drawn characters and a cast to match with Italian American acting titans De Niro and Pacino at the lead stood out in an area of films that had become somewhat disposable and flashy in the 1980's and 90's.\n\nHeat in comparrison did and still continues to sate my appetite for a thrilling and hugely entertaining piece of cinema that doesn't require I leave my brian disengaged.  Michael Mann who meticulously researched and prepared before writing and directing this modern masterpiece. Mann had already impressed with Manhunter, the first film attempt at exploring Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lecter series as well as Thief but Heat saw him armed with a bigger budget than ever and the ace in his pocket two actors who the world had been waiting to see sparring on the screen together for decades.  De Niro and Pacino had appeared in the same film but not sharing any screen time, this was the Godfather Part 2 where De Niro played the younger Vito Coreleone in flashback to Pacino's Michael in the present day.\n \nAlthough certainly not all but some felt short changed at Mann's decison to keep both leading men while continuosly linked throughout the story to not meet on screen until the now much celebrated coffee shop sequence.  They would cross each paths at the end but this meet up was one of the major talking points of the film on release and continues to be studied even now.  While some felt they'd been cheated with the billing of these two on the poster to get one actual scene of proper dialogue my view then and now still is that less is indeed more.\n\nOn subsequent viewings leading up to it makes it that more rewarding when it arrives.  It's not like fireworks are set off, it's actually just a simple conversation between 2 professionals that who admire each other but happen to sit on opposite sides of the fence.  It's more that Mann doesn't make it a big deal that it becomes the legendary scene that other actors have lauded ever since it appeared.  Though this isn't to do the rest of the film a disservice from the slow burn opening that leads to the tense bail bonds robbbery that puts the story in motion right up to the emotionally charged but sombre climax, Heat is an example of what can be accomplished within what had become a tired and worn genre.\n\nA number of films have tried to match up to it's standard but failed, Ben Affleck's directed The Town is clearly taking inspiration but depite being an admirable work feels more like a tribute act than an original in it's own light.  The more recent Triple 9 directed by John Hillcoat despite it's cast seems redundant and shallow in comparrison.  It's fair to say the genre is yet to find a successor.  As well as the complaints of the lack of screen time for the leads some of it's detractors seem to have expected something more action charged from the film, rather than at times a slow burn meditation of a film.  Heat is given time to breathe offer characterisations. Mann offers enough of Hanna's home life for us to see that his job is well on its way to ruining his now third marriage.  Diane Venora's Justine is a three dimensional character as opposed to the usual cliched cops wife and gets enough screentime to make this feel real and not just a plot device\n\nEven fans of the film have talked about Pacino's tendency to overract and while I'm probably more of a fan of him than De Niro by a small margin I must admit as he's got older his acting has somewhat got less sublte and on occasions scenry chomping like.  Although I would argue that Pacino essays Hanna quite brilliantly, he's a great counter point to De Niro's more reserved criminal.  In the recent Q&A with Christopher Nolan Pacino revealed something that some had already suspected, that Hanna chipped cocaine to maintain his intensity. Hanna intones in one scene  \"It keeps me sharp, on the edge, where I gotta be\" when he's explaining why he can't share his job details to his Wife Justine. Though the big shouty moments seem to get most of the attention though the real brilliance of his performance is the more subtle moments, the way he surveys a crime scene the way he commands his team, Pacino has clearly researched this role and this definitely comes through in his portrayal, it doesn't feel like he's just strapped on a gun and badge and is going through the motions.\n\nMcCauley's is more of a closed book and intentionally so, though from the moment he meets Amy Brenneman's Edie she opens him to an alternative to his current situation.  By Allowing some variety into life and a someone to care about he betrays his usual life style that has abled him to maintain his profession so successfully. The complexity of his situation leads to his fate, he wants change but in the end he can't let go of his old life but then this new aspect he's invited in also contributes to where he ends up.  The genre rarely offers such depth and it'a part of the reason the film has been reverred and it has resonated with many directors over last 2 decades. De Niro is simply like Pacino electrifying, his intensity his layered reading, while a methodical professional with a ruthless calculating mind but also loyal and clearly a caring friend and later lover.  \n\nWhere some have sugggested De Niro has the edge I would argue neither comes out on top here.  It's only on subsequent viewings you see  that Pacino is easilly equal to De Niro, it's something that is likely to be debated over as it has been throughout their career who is the best?  Well here for me they are equal and the wait to see them on the screen together was more than worth it.\n\nWith two leads a given, Heat also has an outstanding supporting cast, one thing the film does is remind you of what a talent Val Kilmer was. He's rarely been better and offers a layered portrayal of Chris Shiherlis. A gambling addiction which is impacting on his marriage to Charlene a career best performance from an excellent Ashley Judd. Their final scene together is heartbreaking, both depsite their problems clearly deeply love each other.  Mann unlike some of his peers as with Verona can write exceptionally well for women, both are integral to their male counterpoints and not just thinly written stereotypes. Another actor that has disappeared off the radar at one point seem to have a promising career is Tom Sizemore, here as Michael Cheritto, while not quite as impressive as Kilmer and Judd he offers a superb performance as action junkie sociopath Cheritto.  Dany Trejo is fine as Trejo although he's the least interesting of the group.\n\nHanna's team also offers more quality supporting roles, Mykelti Williamson's Sgt Drucker is probably the one who gets the most screentime, an incredibly gifted actor who not only gets some great dialogue but all has some great scenes, especially with Judd towards the end of the film. Ted Levine as Bosco makes the most of his screentime and Wes Studi is on fine form as loyal soldier Casals.  The supporting cast is so rich with even a  seasoned actor like Jon Voight gets a key but brief role as McCauley's fence Nate and Chris Noonan already having delivered a memorable turn in Mann's Manhunter appears briefly as well. With also Hank Azaria and Jeremey Piven making an appearance.\n\nAs well as the obvious heavy weight leads the other star here is obviously Michael Mann himself who not only presents his greateast directorial effort to date but also furnishes himself with a terrific script that serves all so impressively.  Mann meticulously researched this before starting production and due to his connections with law enforcement was allowed to get a first hand experience, that he would channel into his script.  The story has more than some basis in fact, Mann had already attempted to look at McCauley and Hanna's story when he directed a TV Movie L.A Takedown in 1989.  McCauley was the fictional Patrick McClaren in the film, he changed it to the real life McCauley for Heat. Both films are based on the real life story of Neil McCauley a calcualting criminal who was eventually killed by real life Hanna Chuck Adamson. Voight's Nate is based on Edward Bunker a ex con, acclaimed author and also Mr Blue in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. Mann also is served by the legendary Dante Spinotti who imbues the film with it's distinctive look.\n\n \nThe film has some subplots that you can imagine a studio executive might have wanted gone to tighten up the film.  One in particular has Dennis Haysbert as an ex con Breeden trying to rehabilitate back into sociey with the assistance of his wife.  His predicament seeing him having to accept humilating employment where he's taken advantage of.  His stories inclusion here though only makes sense later in the film and like with the key characters rather than some plot device he's a living breathing character that when we see his fate when he's unable to leave behind his old life not unlike McCauley we understand the tragedy fully of his predicamant.  It's a testament to Mann to not remove it, when other less expertly made films would surely have cut it out to save on time.  Mann actually doesn't believe Heat to be a genre film and there is some truth to this. Yes it does inhabit that world but it deals with other things like Chris and Charlenes marriage issues and also Hanna's trouble teenage step daughter played by the then 14 year old Natalie Portman.The disappointment of some that it's not more of a quick action fix is a tonic to others. This is the very opposite of the quick fire shallow Michael Bay like pyrothechnics that seemed to populate the 90's and beyond.\n\nThat being said Heat certainly doesn't short change us on action, ironically although it can't be described as an action film it delivers  one segment that towers above any action sequence of that decade and beyond.  When McCauley's crew pull their final job they walk straight out of the bank they have just robbed right into Hanna and his squad, they have no alternative but to battle it out with the high powered weapons they are carrying.  Staying with the theme of realism, Mann employed the ex British special force (SAS) member Andy Mcnabb to stage the ensuing gun battle.  The litteral deafening raining gun fire as McCauley and his men tried to evade capture and Hanna and team try to stop them.  Think William Friedkin and Owen Roitzman's staging of their legendary car pursuit in the French Connection and apply that method to this scene and you'll get some idea of the sheer visceral intensity that is experienced.\n\nHeat is simply a testament to what can be done with the good old fashioned cops and robbers theme invested with a top class cast and crew firing on all cylinders. It does not short change in any department, to be honest you could talk about this film for hours.  The best way to appreciate this masterpiece is to watch it, if it's your first time boy you are in for a treat but if it's a film that you are more than familiar with, because of it's dense and epic content there is always something new to see within it's layers, Heat litterally is the gift that keeps giving.",

Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are flawless in this film where they play opponents on the opposite side of the law. It is a complex game of cat and mouse where Pacino plays LA cop, Vince who is investigating the violent gang lead by De Niro's character, Neil. The two share the screen only fleetingly but there's a pivotal role where they meet over a coffee and the atmosphere just crackles with electricity. Being a Michael Mann film, it naturally looks amazing. As slick as a 1980s Athena print. It also has some of Mann's hallmark action sequences which are at times rather violent, but not gratuitously so. There's a scene of a bank heist which, when I first watched this movie back in the 1990s, was I thought the best such scene I'd ever seen. Twenty years on it still looks amazing, if rather OTT. Heat remain a slick, intelligent, stylish movie. It is elevated above merely looking good by a great script, superbly delivered by an ensemble of great Hollywood actors who were directed by a terrific master of his craft at the height of his game.",

            "content": "Heat is just one of those films that most movie fans will insist you must see at some point, and I didn't have the pleasure (or desire) until now. I was a little nervous, because usually when cinephiles insist on a particular film, it isn't exactly the kind of fun escapism that I love. Luckily, Heat was a surprisingly great experience. Most people would probably jump right to the acting performances in a film like this, but the story is what enthralled me for the full (rather long) run-time. I've always enjoyed heist movies, and that whole cat-and-mouse game between cops and robbers is fascinating. This was one of the strongest versions of a heist film I've ever seen because it matches criminals who are at the top of their game against detectives who are also the best of the best. No one is doing something extremely stupid which leads to their downfall in this movie. Instead it is a battle of wits where both parties are acting very intelligently, and hoping that their skill is enough to come out on top. Thankfully, they don't needlessly bog us down in setup and flashbacks and all that nonsense, instead we get to know the characters and everything that is happening to them as the story progresses.\n\nWhen I do start to look at the acting, it is almost flawless from the top of that cast list down to the bottom. Pacino vs. De Niro is obviously the big story, and they certainly make it something special. The contentious yet oddly respectful relationship that they form is great fun to watch and creates the perfect coda to the film. Essentially these 2 men are opposite sides of the same coin, they both see that in order to be the best at what they do they must abandon any attachment to people and things. And if they break that rule and form a strong connection it would put their job (even their life in danger.) That's why things end they way they do, but I won't spoil that here. Val Kilmer is the third wheel in this film, because he also gets a decent amount of character development, and I certainly like what he did with this performance. I'm not 100% sure why his character needed to be fleshed out in this way. I think perhaps it is for the sake of comparison and contrast with the path that De Niro takes in the end, but it's hard for me to say. I mean, I'm never going to complain much about some Kilmer in my movies, but if any character could have been cut down to shorten up the film it would be his.\n\nThe length didn't bother me as much as I expected it would. I can be a real whiner about movies that drag on too long, but through most of Heat I didn't really notice. I think they got me invested in the characters and anxious to see what would happen next, so a little extra time taken here or there didn't bother me too much. There were some definite scripting issues in the film. It is somewhat light on dialogue (which I like) but when people are having heart-to-heart conversations they sometimes talk in ways that are overly scripted. There's one scene where Diane Venora is talking to Al Pacino and I thought \"is she quoting some crappy Shakespeare or something??\" It was so artificial and dramatically far removed from anything a normal human being would say in that situation. Most of the time I didn't notice this in Heat, but every once in awhile I hear Michael Mann talking instead of the character on screen. It's hard to criticize Mann too much for his scripting, though, because the rest of the film looks and feels so great. It's one of those movies that had me questioning who is good and who is bad and, if the criminals are always bad, what does that say about me when I root for them. If you haven't seen Heat, then I'd highly recommend it. This is the kind of film I will want to see again, and dig into more in the future.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Our Daily Stream: Michael Mann - Heat. Zum Geburtstag des Regisseurs! - Es gibt diese eine Szene im Zentrum von Heat, die das Subjekt von Michael Manns Action Thriller ist. Hier haben wir den Polizisten Hanna (Al Pacino), der einen der meistgesuchten Diebe, McCauley (Robert De Niro), jagt. McCauley ist ungeheuer raffiniert und achtsam - fast unmöglich zu fangen. Seit Tagen ist Hanna bereits hinter ihm her, bis dahin erfolglos. Eines Nachts als Hanna McCaulys Wagen beschattet, lässt er ihn einfach rechts ran fahren. McCauley ist bewaffnet, doch das ist kein Moment der Gefahr. Hanna fragt bloss: \"What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?\" - McCauley antwortet, dass sich die Idee gut anhört. Nun sitzen sich diese beiden müden Männer mittleren Alters im Diner gegenüber. Beide haben so viel Erfahrung, dass sie genau wissen, was der Gegenüber repräsentiert. Sie trinken zusammen Kaffee. McCauley erzählt eine Anekdote, wie er mal einen Liqueur Store ausraubte. Schliesslich endet ihr Gespräch. \"I don't know how to do anything else\", sagt der Dieb. \"Neither do I.\" Diese Szene verdeutlicht uns: Hier sitzen zwei Männer, die einander brauchen. Sie sind Feinde, teilen aber diesen intimen Moment, der sie einander näher bringt als es ein Treffen mit Freunden könnte. Oder mit ihren Frauen. Frauen, sie sind das andere Thema in Heat. Zwei der wichtigsten Charaktere sind verheiratet und auch McCauley verliebt sich. Hannas dritte Ehefrau, die auch noch Justice (Diane Venora) heisst, ist zornig über die Obsession, die er seiner Arbeit entgegenbringt. McCauley seinerseits will sich auf nichts einlassen, dass eine längere Zeitspanne als 30 Sekunden umfasst. Er lernt eine Frau namens Eady (Amy Brenneman) kennen, die unbedingt wissen will, was er macht. McCauley fragt sie, woher dieses unbedingte Interesse rührt. Eady begründet es mit ihrer Einsamkeit. \"I am not lonely\", entgegnet der Dieb, obwohl er offensichtlich der einsamste Mann der Welt ist. Später wird er merken, dass er sie braucht. Da ist er wieder, der uralte Konflikt im amerikanischen Film: Der arbeitende Mann und die Frau, die ihn zu Hause halten will. Michael Mann behandelt das mit viel Verständnis und Einsicht. Sein Drehbuch hat phasenweise fast literarische Qualitäten. Die Männer in Manns Film können gar nicht anders. Selbst als McCauley und seine Bande das Geld zusammenhaben, sich nach Neuseeland abzusetzen, sind sie dazu nicht in der Lage. Es ist nicht die Beute, es ist der Kitzel! Während des gesamten Films bleibt McCauley der Stratege, während Hanna seinen nächsten Schritt erraten muss. De Niro und Pacino (zum ersten Mal gemeinsam vor der Kamera) haben die meiste Zeit ihrer Karriere damit verbracht, Cops und Gangster zu spielen. An dieser Stelle soll die Diskussion vorweggenommen werden, wie diese beiden Actors (sie lernten ihr Schauspiel im Actors Studio nach den Prinzipien von Lee Strasberg) an ihre Rollen herangehen würden. Würden sie als Vorbereitung ihre Zeit mit Cops und Gangstern teilen? Ich denke aber, De Niro und Pacino haben ihre Rollen aus Versatzstücken alter Hollywood Filme zusammengesetzt. Instintktiv erfassen sie, wie der maximale Effekt erreicht wird! Die Frauen befinden sich meist in der Küche und es wirkt, als ob sie ihre Jungs abends vom Spielen heim rufen. Hannas Frau ist die unerbittlichste und auch die verbitterste: Immerhin bringt ihr Mann seine Leichen mit ins Ehebett, wenn er nachts unter Albträumen leidet. Im Grunde ist ihre Ehe ein Witz. Die anderen Frauen mögen noch Illusionen haben, doch wir wissen, wo die enden werden. Bestimmt nicht in Neuseeland! Heat ist nicht einfach bloss ein Action Film. Die Dialoge erlauben den Figuren, uns mitzuteilen, was sie denken und fühlen. Es gibt sogar poetische Momente und im Grunde sind ihre Themen existentialistisch. Es ist schrecklich, wenn man sich niemandem mitteilen kann, wenn man seine Gefühle nicht ausdrücken kann. Diese Charaktere sind dazu in der Lage. Es hilft ihnen aber trotzdem nichts.",

While Heat, certainly his best film, gained him significant notoriety at the time, a look back reveals that even this good movie showcases some of Mann's most obvious flaws. Despite a fantastically good cast, many of the interactions, especially early on, seem overacted in the extreme. At first I thought it might be Pacino, but once Mann settles down, it gets better. Mann clearly doesn't have a handle on his creative team, and it reflects in the film. Another troubling aspect is the awful sound mixing. A lot of older films don't have the greatest action/soundtrack/voice volume ratio and I can live with that but Heat has it bad and then some. The soundtrack is awful, the gunfire fake and mismatched with the weapon and trigger timing while natural sounds often take over shots in a very unsavory manner. The movie is at least an hour too long, with the entire first third of the movie forming a jumbled mess as Mann unsuccessfully tries to spin too many plates. Pacino's character's wife is a confusing and stereotypical add on while Danny Trejo serves very little purpose to the film at all. Pacino's daughter, played by Natalie Portman, is another unnecessary and befuddling piece to the puzzle. Too many characters simply don't have an arc because Mann can't move fast enough to address everything and the tone is too serious for the sheer number of characters anyways. On top of everything, portions of the movie seem mismatched in terms of the period, which waffles between the 70s, 80s and 90s for no discernible reason. What is incredible however is that despite Mann's desperate attempts to hijack the film into a cliff, the incredible star power he managed to dupe into playing actually make this film pretty good for the last two thirds. Pacino settles down and De Niro is incredible as always. The rest of the heist crew does a great job as well (poor Tom Sizemore just doesn't get much besides Saving Private Ryan for his career) and somehow the movies manages to come together with some incredible and iconic scenes near the end. The best example of this is the final scene of the movie. In this last one-on-one gun battle, the volume is shot to hell, I can't hear De Niro's last words and there is something funky going on with the cymbals in the soundtrack. Any other actors and this ending, combined with the sum of the film, goes to hell. But the clear connection between De Niro and Pacino, their gravity as two of the greatest, possibly the greatest dramatic crime actors of all time, carries the scene to the finish line. Call it the De Niro/Pacino magic but it works and Mann should thank is lucky stars someone was there to save his trainwreck of a film and turn it into a crime classic.",

This complicates their main drive of focus, which is the hunt of the theft and of the criminal.  Another interesting note is that Pacino and De Niro are only seen on screen briefly in what is very much a \"Les Miserables\" moment at the end.",

A deposit is issued to the criminal with the score, and it is up to McCauley and his crew to come through or they lose their money, freedom or lives. The often unmentioned component that really separates from other standard fare, is the access the viewer has to the private lives of all of the main characters. These people are all caught in purgatorial dysfunction, created both by the criminals, their wives and families, but by those of the Detectives (Vincent in particular). The Classic scene where DeNiro and Pacino sit down for coffee, discovering how similar their lives are. One could not exist without the other. The cast is absolutely flawless as is the cinematography. And, in the end we learn the same lesson we always do when good actively pursues absolute evil. But, (SPOILER) it is hard not feel a slight degree of empathy for the McCauley character. The very, very last scene in the movie, the last 60 seconds before credits begin, utilizes music and cinematography to fill the viewer with a deep, somewhat unexplainable feeling of absolute hope in humanity.",

It starts promisingly with a slick pace and fluid camerawork as the central characters are united for their first onscreen robbery. Many of the moments with Al Pacino are great fun, especially when his trademark madness is allowed to run loose, and De Niro has a cool, steely demeanour, keeping him down to earth and believable as he applies his trade with the net around him visibly tightening. Unfortunately, too much of the movie is dedicated to slow, mostly uninteresting scenes of either the criminals planning their next job, the police discussing how to take them down, or Pacino and his third wife analysing the personal problems that practically every movie cop has. It's a clichéd premise with clichéd characters and clichéd events. The bank robbery is the high point for sure: A tense raid followed by an exciting and often brutal shootout.

It has the best shootout scene ever midway into the movie. Although classified as an action movie, there isn't that much action rather than suspense. However, the shootout scene after The Crew exists the bank is raw pure action at its best. You should see the movie just because of this scene alone. The second standout scene is when Pacino and De Niro meets at the coffee shop. This is Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, two legends, at their absolute peak, in one of their best scenes in their respective careers. Yes, its that good. The cop and thief meet and realize they not only have something in common. They are equals, but on opposite sides of the law. Or \"the flip side of the coin\". Movie history was made here, and you have two historic scenes for which you are obliged to watch this movie. \nThe rest of movie is great, with excellent supporting support with strong acting. Some social critique should be made towards the glorification of the criminals. It portray most of them, with one crucial exception, as not just partners in crime, but as blood brothers with a deep strong paleolithic connection and honor code. While this criminal brotherhood has been portrayed to frequently and excessively in Hollywood; here it is not much as portrayed as it is understood by context. It is not intrusively explicit as is too often the case.\nThe other critique goes to the action of the police task force during the major shoot scene. It could be argued that the police had to act. However, considering that they knew about the exceptional professionalism of the bank robbers, nothing less than the resulting mayhem should have been expected. Of course, this is just a move, and the resulting action is one of the best, it is still troubling (a script flaw) to see that kind of police recklessness considering their demonstrated professionalism. It is good raw entertainment though.\nThe 0.5 star minus comes from the doomed, predictable, justice pleasing, obliged, cop out, of the final scene. It did handle the cop out pretty well, but it was still a \"cop\" out.",

            "content": "If you lined up all of Michael Mann's films in a row, \"Heat\" would be the masterpiece. Starring Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, this powerful crime drama highlights everything we love about Mann's style: his ability to weave together engrossing character studies, transcendent themes, and intense action, and to do it in an entertaining, soaring, intimate - and yet epic - way.\n\nDeNiro is Neil McCauley, a career criminal: elite, effective, and stuck to a code: \"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.\" This disciplined approach to his \"work\" is what allows him to take high-reward scores with consistent regularity. His team plans their operations meticulously, cognizant of police response time, escape routes, potential risks, etc. His character, in addition to being reasonably good-natured, is precise and cunning. Something in his past pushed him to the wrong side of the law, but not far enough to break his sense of decency, his appreciation for other people, and his dreams for the future. He has hope. He yearns for a life of peace in Fiji with love interest Eady, retired from the underworld and the dangers he puts his men - whom he calls his friends - through.\n\nPacino is Vincent Hanna, the obsessive detective on McCauley's trail. He pursues his prey with expertise born of years spent away from home and family, prowling the city with determination and jaded experience. Pacino plays the character fast and loose, with scene-stealing charisma. Although a steadfast officer of the law, he is unpredictable, swinging between lighthearted sarcasm and angst-ridden monologues. The darkness of the world stirs up a righteous bitterness that consumes him and yet propels him forward, constantly sniffing out the scent of his prey. It is what keeps him interested in life and on the lighter side of morality - though Hanna himself is flawed, struggling to keep a marriage and constantly fighting his demons of obsession.\n\nWhat Mann does with great success in this movie is present the good qualities of the bad guy and the bad qualities of the good guy. It's harder than it sounds. By the climax of the movie, you're on the edge of your seat, wondering who will come out on top, wondering if McCauley will fulfill his dream - and wondering why you would want a bad guy like him to succeed in the first place. You care about these characters, you're invested in their future, you know what makes them tick - and this knowledge draws you in.\n\nAt one point, McCauley and Hanna actually agree to meet over coffee, with no ulterior motive - the felon respects the skills of the detective enough to hear him out, and Hanna has no intention of bringing McCauley in on small charges with no long-term consequences. Their peaceful meeting is relaxed - friendly, even. They share their lives with one another, discussing their fears and hopes - and both offer careful warnings, expressing their dedication to their objectives. The dialogue here is fantastic and one of the highlights of this film and any other movie in the genre.\n\nThe film continues to show its maturity with the understated, subtle presentation of characters and plot points. As he would in \"Collateral\" (2004), Mann allows Los Angeles to become its own character - shimmering by night and emptier than you might expect by day - the welcome space gives the multiple protagonists and antagonists room to breathe, to develop, to seize the spotlight with simply their lives, their motivations, their actions and counteractions. There is nothing particularly mind-blowing presenting itself: helicopters don't explode into buildings, cops and robbers don't fire endless amounts of slow-motion bullets, and nobody takes daredevil leaps off buildings. The epic nature of the story is seeing man pitted against man, not only in strategy but in psyche. \"Heat\" is more than a crime/action/drama - it is a character study in one of its most entertaining forms.\n\nThe superb supporting cast includes Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenneman, Mykelti Williamson, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Jon Voight, and Danny Trejo. With mood-infused cinematography, a gorgeously subtle soundtrack, and a running time that allows the plot to come to a satisfying, effective conclusion, \"Heat\" transcends the genre and leaves the viewer wanting much, much more.",

The heist to start the movie and the climactic last one are amazing but the rest of the movie is bogged down with sub plots that try and force character development down the audience's throat. Pacino's acting is more funny now that the movie has aged and De Niro just seems to be going through the motions. The movie's focus is drawn towards how the occupations of the characters affect their family life. The cat and mouse game between the cops and crooks was really entertaining and would have made a more interesting movie had it been the focal point. A kind of crew vs crew showdown as the final heist scene, which you had but the impact of the support characters getting killed off lost any emotional impact because you didnt really care about them. And the ones you do care about made it out alive anyways. And Pacino's character should have died in the end. That might have saved the movie for me anyways.",

            "content": "How do you sum up a behemoth just shy of 3 hours, in a simple review? An essay would need to be written to do the movie Heat justice, but without going that far, im going to try my best to critique the film, without being too long winded. For those of you who have never seen Heat before, where have you been? Its a filmatic landmark, in genre defining, its gorgeous, it influenced hundreds of films, computer games, television shows... In what is arguably the best Michael Mann film to date, all of his qualities come out to play, with an all star cast, a plethora of content and some fucking awesome set pieces. In a nut shell, a small criminal group lead by Neil McCauley, put together a series of heists, in order to pave the way for their retirement, all family men, despite Neil, who longs for company. These guys are complete professionals at what they do. When a simple heist goes wrong, due to a dodgy member of the group, the attention of Vincent, a detective, in every living breathing word of the term, sets out on a no holes barred mission, to take these guys down, before they can execute their plan and flee the country. Only McCauleys group are always 1 step ahead of the game, proving this to be a worthy adversery for the detective mastermind Vincent. The cast is just a cut above the rest, Robert Ne Niro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo, Natile Portman, Ashley Judd, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Piven and Jon Voight but a few make up this extremely large and powerful ensemble, that merge together to bring us a neo noir, full throttle, heart pounding criminal masterpiece and with Michael Mann at the helm, the film just oozes style, substance and character all the way through. Pacino is on fire as Vincent, his character is possessed with catch De Nero\"s McCauley, he eats sleeps and breathes his every moves sacrificing his own life and marrage, in order to stop this guy. Equally De Niro equals his every move, trying to find company, while trying to hold together a dream that becomes impossible to hold onto. Val Kilmer is brutally excellent as Neil's right hand man, with his own sub plot, a family, a child, willing to risk it all, while trying to keep a dying marrage intact. Everyone here, no matter how small the role plays a key part in the films success. Everyone in this film is important and of extreme content, not one person is throwaway, no circumstance to convieniant. Heat is also the first time, that the 2 acting legends get to meet, on screen and go toe to toe in a film ever, making this an even more impressive set up, yes their scenes together are few and far between, but that only strengthens their impact. The script is tremendous, it just keeps barrel rolling down a steep slope until crashing at the bottom, firing off twist and turns, back stabs and double crosses, heists gone wrong, marrage failures, death, parole, rape, action, obsession, it touches on every single subject imaginable and in really outstanding detail. No matter how bad or innocent a character is, you feel for their outcome, you itch to find out their fate. This makes Heat just wonderful to watch, not least to mention the wonderfully shot and lit LA skyline, Mann has always had a thing for the colour blue, but here, he goes into overdrive, with what might be his bluest movie yet. The tones, the grit, the sheen and vibrancy of every meticulous shot, lend exactly to the edit what needs to be shown, nothing is of waste here, there is no filler, nothing boring. It's all down to brilliant acting, brilliant dialogue and an enthralling story, that just keeps on giving until the last seconds. Heat also contains a hand full but a golden handful of set pieces, that inspired everything that came after it, a band heist for example, that is high octaine, pounding, loud, damaging and violent. Its a no holds barred effort and boy does it really pack a punch. The way the entire sequence is handled, running through stages of calm and hysterics, and taking the time to masterfully pace them together is just jaw dropping, bravo to the editor for managing to keep your heart pounding, especially during some of the quieter scenes. There is always a sense of tension round every corner, every character feels endangered, every moment feels like it could explode. In my eyes, there really isnt much to fault about this film. The entire story is satifying on so many levels, its smart, its heart felt, its powerful. The visuals are stunning, the effects mind blowing. The acting is some of the best your going to get anywhere across the board. The music is a treat and adds such a wonderful cherry on top. It never bores, it has infinate rewatchability and is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made, dont own it at your ignorance and dont watch it at your stupidity. A complete masterpiece.",

The two reasons I didn't turn it off were the two leads Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. These two have such a big screen presence, you can't but watch whenever they are on screen. Once the big bank robbery happens, thats when I found myself on the edge of my seat. The huge shootout in the streets was so intense. Constant gunfire and no music gives it a sense of gritty realism which makes the scene all the more tense and suspenseful. The movie went on full excitement mode afterwards and I was really invested.

The other guy is the mysterious Neil \nMcCauley (Two-Time Oscar Winner:Robert De Niro), who is a master thief and \nbank robber.

Which she finds him fascinating as a man but he keeps his secret from her. But things falls apart, when Neil's last robbery didn't go well, when their last crew member (Kevin Gage) messed up badly during it and dealing with a double crossing corrupted businessman millionaire Roger Van Zant (William Fichtner).\n\nWritten and Directed by Michael Mann (The Keep, Manhunter, Public Enemies) made an highly entertaining crime drama with two terrific lead performances by Pacino and De Niro makes this one, an must see. The two leads shares just a few minutes together on the screeen but when they do, those sequences between Pacino and De Niro are just terrific. Mann's visual style is also first rate, writing and direction is expectional and also the visceral action sequences are just outstanding. The supporting cast are wonderful, especially Jon Voight's role as Nate. Voight plays the role as a man, who knows how to get information of any kind. If there is one complain about \"Heat\", the pacing does some slow at times but at the same time, it is necessary. \n\nMann actually remade this from a TV movie, he made in 1989 from NBC, it is titled \"L.A. Takedown\" but Mann wasn't quite happy with it, when NBC re-edited the TV movie in a way that Mann didn't like his vision to be seen. \"Heat\" was certainly one of the best movies of 1995. Most characters are fleshed out, some do leave to be desired but \"Heat\" is about the various characters that the story follows and most of them are intriguing, especially the two lead characters, despite there are the opposite sides of the law. They do share something in common and that is one of the main reasons why \"Heat\" is a winner. Grade:A.",

I watch it because every time I hope that Robert De Niro doesn't go back for Waingro. I hope both men survive so that we can have a sequel but at 3 hour running time we are given all that we're going to get.\nDirector Michael Mann makes epic, patient thrillers about men with codes. He brought us Last of the Mohicans, Miami Vice (both TV show & movie) and Collateral. There's a quiet awe in the way he films the robbery scenes. No judgment here except on the conniving ones who break the code of honor among thieves.\nSo what did I see differently the umpteenth time around? The comrodery of the crews, both police and criminals. The inability of these men to have real lives outside of their jobs. A pack of wolves without much of a family. Two men who through different choices, could have easily been one another. \nBesides DeNiro and Pacino this cast is loaded. Val Kilmer, Amy Brenneman, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, John Voight, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Haysbert, Mykelti Williamson, Hank Azaria, Danny Trejo, and Ted Levine. All do a great work here, some even do their best work.\nAltogether this is a masterful take on the cops and robber genre. Plus how cool is it to see these actors and screen? So cool.",

            "content": "Heat is not your typical crime thriller. If you've seen Mann's most recent work, the incredible Public Enemies, you'll know that the action, whilst being amazing, plays second fiddle to the atmosphere which Michael Mann endeavours to create and the characters which he makes you understand. So if you're expecting Bay-like explosions or... well... Bay-like character development, script or something within the realm of a Transformers film, best be changing you're thinking now. \n\nHeat follows the story of two men: the cop, Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino in one of his best performances ever) and the thief, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro in one of HIS best performances). Yes, even though it is historic for bringing these two titans together onscreen for the first time, and a lot of the film is focussed on the characters these two bring to vivid life, Michael Mann, cleverly, keeps these two apart for almost the entire film, bringing them together for the first time in one of cinema's most reknowned scenes; the coffee shop scene. More of that later. \n\nWe begin Heat with a cryptic first sequence which is only really understood after the second viewing, which shows De Niro simply walking through a hospital and driving out in an ambulance. Upon the second viewing, Mann's subtly brilliant directing becomes apparent, giving the viewer a real taste of McCauley and how he goes through life, analysing everything; every strange noise and random movement, anything even slightly out of the ordinary. Truly amazing stuff. The rest of the films direction is no less attentive or amazing as Mann creates a bleak yet fascinating, burnished daytime Chicago in which our character's live. It seems as though the scum of the city is just about to burst through but it's kept under a single layer of decency. Mann's precision filming is a fascinating thing to watch, as he captures every moment of the brilliant leads onscreen, drawing the best performance out of the both of them that he can. He lingers lovingly on his actor's faces, framed to perfection and set in a nighttime blue or a daytime darkness, as if you're wearing very light sunglasses while watching the film. Truly brilliant. \n\nThe script is beyond any reproach; a perfect level of realism for every character as well as some killer lines. Mann obviously prefers to let his actors extrapolate for themselves what their character might be doing at the time, as most of the time more is understood from a single glance than any line of dialogue the character may utter. That doesn't render it obsolete, however. The film would be average without it. Without the support of this incredible document, De Niro and Pacino would never have made their characters so believeable or layered. \n\nSpeaking of those two, they are absolutely amazing. They know their characters inside and out. Nothing about the people they portray is foreign to them, every tick, every movement, every glance, they are completely inhabiting the real-life counterparts at all times. The supporting cast pale comparrison, despite their own strong performances, in particular Amy Brenneman and Val Kilmer who both do extremely well, especially Kilmer who shows that he actually was good, extremely good, he just slipped a little. But these two performers, backed by this brilliant script and coached by this amazing director are the real strength of the film. Not that they carry it on their shoulders, but they take to a stratospheric level. \n\nGreat action set pieces abound, just by the way, in particular the shootup in the streets of LA and others such as the first major heist, but Mann's action scenes are of a different breed to todays explosion fests. His action sequences involve the building of tremedous tension, an ever tightening which you fear will never break which is much more riveting than a simple shoot 'em up. Where every move is crucial and real danger is actually felt, these scenes are intensely dramatic as well as being some amazing spectacles. \n\nHeat is a modern American classic crime thriller, the obvious inspiration of films such as The Dark Knight and a must watch for any movie buff, or for someone who just wants to watch an awesome movie. \n\nDefining Scene: \nThe coffee shop scene. Of course. The close runner-up is the platinum heist.",

The tight script and ambitious character arches make this an ideal movie to rewatch time and again, especially if you love guns blazing action scenes. \nThere's a lot of things to praise in this movie, but I want to focus on two. First is the level of gamesmanship between De Niro and Pacino. It truly feels like watching Bird and Magic or Manning and Brady with two all-time greats facing off in the film. The coffee shop scene between the two of them is arguably the best moment in the movie and an instant classic.\nThere other thing that always strikes me is Mann's cast of characters. The network of characters reminds me of St. Louis, a big city known for its small town feel. You get to know every person in this movie and their motives, ranging from top dogs like De Niro and Pacino to bit players like the chef/get-away driver (Dennis Haysbert.) I've never scene a movie with so many people portrayed in such a vivid and intentional light. It remains the best example of building a community of characters from the ground up, something Mann achieves before even reaching act three.",

            "content": "Rating: 10/10\n\nIt has been a very long time since I first saw this film, and that was about a year or so after it released which would put me around 13 years old.  I barely remembered it at all before watching it again, but I vaguely remember liking it okay.  I'm reminded in watching it again just how much age and experience can factor into the enjoyment and appreciation of a film.  Heat is a fantastic film and now, being older and wiser, I can fully appreciate that fact.\n\nMichael Mann has directed many awesome films such as Collateral, Last of the Mohicans, and The Insider, but Heat is his masterpiece.  Starring heavyweights Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, two of the greatest actors to ever grace the screen, Heat is a masterful crime drama with depth and thrills and fantastic characters.  The supporting cast is positively loaded, with Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voigt, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Haysbert, Willaim Fichtner, Natalie Portman, and a few others all lending their immense talent to this film, and not a single one of them are wasted.\n\nHeat could easily be simplified as a cat-and-mouse drama between Pacino's and De Niro's characters, and while that thread certainly exists it is both an oversimplification of their story and the story as a whole.  Heat is really all about these characters, each and every one of them, and the notion spoken by Robert De Niro's character, Neil, on more than one occasion:  \"A guy told me one time, 'Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.'\"  That 'heat' is seemingly always around the corner for these characters, and for various reasons.  Some of them are able to walk away, and some are not.\n\nNow, while I don't want the film's themes to be undersold or the supporting characters forgotten, it certainly is true that De Niro's Neil and Pacino's Vincent are at the heart and center of the film.  Vincent is a lieutenant who is all about his job.  Catching the bad guys is all he's good at and ultimately all he really cares about, which is mostly why he's on his third marriage and why it's likely to go the way of the first two.  It's not that he doesn't care about his wife or his stepdaughter, but the job is who he is.  Neil is the other side of the coin, and I mean that in as literal a way as possible.  He is all about the job as well, only his job is the score.  That quote that underlines the films theme is his personal motto.  He knows when to walk away, and that can be from a job or a colleague or even a lover.  It goes without saying that Neil and Vincent are pitted against each other here, but that does not mean there is animosity.  Quite the opposite.  There is a lot of respect between these two characters because they are so similar and so good at what they do.  They understand each other, and part of that is the understanding that when it comes down to it, because of their principles, neither will hesitate to put the other down.\n\nDe Niro and Pacino spend very little of the near-3 hour running time on the screen together, but that isn't a bad thing at all.  For one thing it fits the story perfectly, and secondly those few times they are together are made that much better.  Oh, and how great those moments are.  I can't help but wonder if this film has an underhanded motive of acknowledging the fact that choosing which of these two actors, in their prime, is next to near impossible.  They have been cast in similar roles in similar films, and were both the major players in The Godfather Part II.  However, unlike that film, Heat shows them on screen together, even if it is just for a few, sumptuous moments.  And in their characters, who are equals, there may be that notion that these two actors are also equals.  Both masters of their craft.  And so they are.\n\nHeat is a brilliant and atmospheric work of art.  It is engaging from beginning to end and should be on any film junky's list of must-see films.",

Some of the best filmed actions scenes of the decade. I can see why people loved it. I can remember why I loved it as a young boy. \n\nWatching it two decades later, it fails to impress. The script lacks focus. It's a traditional cops-and-robber story, but there's never enough politics to make that aspect of the script the main focus. Instead we get sporadic glimpses into the personal lives of everyone - a good change in pace for the genre. But the characters are left incredibly flat. Not enough time is spent on either stage (family or business) for the audience to start caring deeply about any of the characters. An incredible feat, given the total run-time is nearly 3 hours! The interactions are meaningful, but the essential conduit of said interactions - the dialogue - is mostly pandering, or unimaginative, or both at times. Good actors can only do so much.\n\nThe Pacino-De Niro coffee shop scene is a classic. De Niro delivers. If nothing else, it is worth a watch just for that.\n\nPS: 16-y-o Natalie Portman is the cutest thing ever.",

And Robert De Niro is a terrific actor whom I've started to have a similar feeling about. He's also appeared in a lot of critically acclaimed movies, especially with Martin Scorsese, and I plan to watch some of those. \n\n'Heat' features an interesting cast of familiar faces such as: Tom Sizemore, Wes Studi, Val Kilmer, William Fichtner and Natalie Portman (uncredited) - with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro playing the leads. \nThere's little character development on the side, but not much to offer as was expected. The main focus is mainly De Niro's character, a criminal called Niel McCauley. This focus of the movie is extreme and De Niro pulls that off really well with his unique talent and ability to play those sort of villainous roles. \nPacino is also excellent and gives  yet another great performance to the screen as the homicide detective Vincent Hanna, whose leading the case to bring a gang of professional bank robbers, led by McCauley, to justice. Pacino also brings Hanna to life with his usual disticntive sense of humour, and he said some funny one-liners and cracked some jokes in different elements of the screenplay, which was quite good. \n\nAs well as fabulous performances there's also credit to be given to director Michael Mann, whose probably made one of the finest movies of his career, and it was produced very well and made from a finely written screenplay. \n\nWhat I loved the most was De Niro's scenes; how he debated upon the shares of money the gang members were to get from their bank heists and their newly planned one. Also his brief scenes with Jon Voight and Val Kilmer were also watchable, due to the dialogue they used, which was strangely hard to follow at times, but that's what amuses me (it's just like how some fancy dialogue used in Scorsese's 'The Departed' was tricky to follow at times, but still presented the movie in a unique way).",

The characters are the best part, and their stories.  Each one is amazingly well developed and, and has a great actor to play them.  This movie has such a great cast of some of the most famous actors there is, Al Pacino, Robert de Niro, Val Vilmer, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, their all here, and do an amazing job for each of their characters.  There's no rooting for good guys or bad guys, as by the end we have no idea who we want to come out on top, and although we want a winner and final standoff, we almost want Neil to escape so neither of them are killed.  So above all the characters are amazing and make the movie.  The story is simple, yet complex and well done, and the long running time is nice to get in everything under great detail.  There's always a sudden turn of events to take place as soon as we think it might be winding down, such as Vincent's stepdaughter cutting her wrists in the bathtub. Caught me completely off guard, and always has your attention ok the screen.  The ending is great, and with the help of a killer score it has a lasting expression.  Last and most certainly not least is the action.  I think this has  100% the best movie shootout ever on screen, not counting military movies, as that's a different category.  The sound effects are something never heard before, no editing, just raw blanks being fired in the city streets with amazing echoes and incredibly loud and violent.  It's non stop crazy real, the bullets hitting cars and walls, blood from hits, empty shells flying from the guns, and reloading like a boss, there's nothing like it anywhere except real life gunfights. Amazing movie, can't say enough, everything is done right, and it shows, shining in every aspect.",

The film doesn't feel like 2 hours and 50 minutes at all and goes by in a breeze. The reason why is that the film has such a smart script with such great performances that it goes by really fast. Al Pacino knocks it out of the park in this film and so does Robert De Niro who actually makes you feel a lot of sympathy for his character despite the fact that he is a criminal. The action is also a lot of fun to watch especially a bank heist scene around the middle of the film which is extremely intense and entertaining. The ending of the film is surprisingly bitter sweet and makes you really feel for the characters in the position they are in. Overall Heat is a fantastic crime thriller with great performances and a fantastic script. It's an experience that I won't soon be forgetting and one everyone should see. If you have not seen Heat please go out and see it. It is well worth your time.",

Rather in the tradition of crime shows like the \"Sopranos\", \"Cagney and Lacey\" we see them as rounded people with girl friends, wives family's beside simply seeing what they do to earn a living. But this isn't some deep let's search for the meaning of life, film, it's a fast paced thriller, full of twists and turns, a great logical plot, and some great set pieces , if you're not on the edge of your seat during some of it, or shouting \" Nooo\" at the screen I'd be very surprised.

There was much discussion in the cinematic community upon Heat's release due to its warranted pedigree (it's the first film where Pacino and De Niro shared a scene), and it certainly earns its cast as it's a character piece that fully fleshes out the two leads. It's an amazing action film too, with Mann's trademark grip on veneer making the film absorbing from the very first shot, and the action set-pieces suggest that he's a maestro with gunplay as much as John Woo and Sam Peckinpah were. Sadly, Heat also suffers from an overlong running time, mainly due to the film having a series of unnecessary sub-plots (one of which wouldn't feel out of place in a prime-time TV procedural drama). Also, the film loses a lot of momentum after the big heist sequence comes and goes, and the ending is a bit of let-down because of it. Despite this, Heat is still a very important film for recent crime fiction as it's influence can be felt in TV shows (True Detective), video games (Grand Theft Auto V), and other movies (Drive), and it's evident now more than ever that no one can do a slow-burn crime drama like Mann does.",

It's an adrenaline pumping, exquisitely filmed scene in a movie filled with great moments.\n\nIt was billed as the first film to be Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino together, and their conversation is yet another highlight. The two men give masterful performances, and thanks to that and the intelligent writing, you never really no who to root for. This is not your run-of-the-mill action picture without a brain. The characters are so strongly developed on both sides of the law you'll find your loyalty wavering more than once. Careful attention was put into this at the script level, also a credit to Mann.\n\nThere are a lot of sub-plots, all of them neatly tied up, that add weight to the film which is yet another asset the director brings. Under a lesser filmmaker, this would have become a jumbled mess. The supporting cast, filled with equally talented actors excel as well, and Elliott Guldenthal's exceptional score adds a dreamlike quality to the picture. \"Heat\" is an action film that exceeds expectations on every level.

His methods are highly sophisticated and he does not tolerate any mistakes. Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is a veteran police detective. He's extremely intelligent and is also the best at what he does. But unfortunately, his hot temper gets in the way and he's not always successful in catching the bad guys. McCauley and his crew's latest hit is an armored car heist. They have successfully eluded the police for so long, but Hanna is determined to get his man. But Hanna's work is taking a toll on his personal life. Meanwhile, the normally detached McCauley finds himself falling in love with an artist. She however, doesn't know his true nature-she thinks he makes a living as a metal salesman. But will falling in love lead to betrayal for McCauley? \n\n\"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.\" \n\nHeat is not just a compelling crime thriller, it's also a fascinating character study. On the surface, it seems like a simple cops-and-robbers story about a group of veteran police detectives who must catch a group of high tech bank robbers. But once you peel the layers, you will discover an intricate storyline with complex characters. All the characters in this movie have their own stories, their own lives. The audience gets to see these stories, see who they really are, what makes them tick, and how they go through life. \n\nThe deliberate pacing doesn't always work and Michael Mann may test your patience at times, but he has a way of keeping your attention. Despite the film's rather length running time, there is hardly a single wasted shot. Every scene counts. Even the quiet moments serve their purpose. \n\nHeat has quite possibly one of the greatest action sequences in cinematic history. What makes this sequence work is not just the action, but the tension leading up to the shoot-out. And the tension continues to palpitate throughout amidst the thousands of rounds of ammunition being fired by both sides. \n\nOverall, Heat is Michael Mann's magnum opus and a must see for every film connoisseur.",

This is an action packed tense, crime thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. One thing that Michael Mann has going for him in this film is a terrific cast that deliver something special on screen. Heat is no ordinary heist film, it's a sophisticated film with sharp dialogue and sharp characters. Its strong story line only adds to its sophistication. Heat is one of the best films of its kind, no other heist film has come close to this action packed roller coaster ride. The scenes with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino electrify each scenes there in. Heat is a stunning crime epic. A jaw dropping masterpiece. This film is a grand film with a simple plot. Michael Mann has done a terrific job with elevating the traditional cops and robbers heist films. This film is something else. The raid on the bank halfway through the film and ensuing shootout in downtown L.A showcases my point perfectly. The thing that elevates this film to epic stature is its impressive cast of actors who are able to turn a somewhat simple story into something grand. Obviously, the most thrilling scenes are the ones with Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro going head to head. The combination of thrills, action, drama and suspense breaks new ground in the crime genre. Both main characters have really good motives, they do what what they do best. This is is a film filled with tension and as the Heat turns up, you stay glued to your tv set to know what will happen next. Heat is one of Michael Mann's greatest achievements as a director and I personally think he's very underrated as a true talent in the Crime genre of films. Heat is a well directed and plotted film that is definitely one of the greatest heist films ever made. This is definitely Michael Mann's finest film. No other Heist film has come close to Heat. This is definitely a classic in the crime genre.",

Robert De Niro plays Neil McCauley, an experienced robber, known for tackling banks and armoured vehicles. McCauley's success has cost him a personal life, not allowing himself to get distracted by any relationships. Al Pacino plays Vincent Hanna, an L.A.P.D. cop putting everything he has into finding McCauley, which also results in a lack of family life. Divorced twice, Hanna is absent in his third marriage. Which of these lonely men will succeed?\n\nMy brief synopsis doesn't even begin to tap into the huge amount of detail and characters in this near 3 hour film. Mann's Heat is definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past 20 years with action scenes worthy of Tarantino and the use of location and camera shot is simply superb. Although the film is so very long and nothing immensely new is done, Mann delivers a truly great crime movie.\n\nWhen you see that the stars of the film are Pacino and De Niro, you can't help but want to watch the film. However, Mann only puts the two together in a few scenes with both putting in solid individual performances. Pacino over-acts his way through the film, which is not a bad thing as it surprisingly works. Much of his time is spent shouting at people and delivering orders, which allow the more dramatic scenes to add more to Pacino's character.\n\nPurposely opposite to Hanna is De Niro's McCauley whose calm and and restricted demeanour creates a character that just breaths lonesome determination for the job at hand. Heat also has a stunning supporting cast which includes Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner.\n\nStunningly brilliant crime thriller although very very long.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n8.5/10.",

            "content": "In what is arguably one of the finest heist movies in history, \"Heat\" pits two acting heavy-weights in Robert De Niro and Al Pacino against one another. One is a professional thief, so well seasoned that he has avoided the law for as long as he can probably remember. The other is a troubled homicide detective whose third marriage is fizzling out due to his over-riding commitment to his job. Each character ultimately finds he has more in common with his adversary than with his peers. Both are flawed, tired and run-down middle-aged men who, in the immortal words of Roger Murtaugh (see: \"Lethal Weapon\") are \"getting too old for this ....\"\n\n\"Heat\" is hardly your average cops and robbers tale. It's long, it's sweeping and is steeped in character moments and conversations. While much of the hype about the film has always revolved around its finale - the bank robbery - it's the small moments that make the film. Take for instance a scene in the middle of the film where Pacino, too tired and beat down to do anything else, tracks down his suspect (De Niro) and invites him for a cup of coffee where the two talk shop and in spite of mutual respect for one another, both vow not to back down. This moment serves to build the tension that is the big pay-off in the film. You get to know and feel for these very real and very flawed characters, so that when the heat is on, so to speak, you don't know who to cheer for anymore.\n\nUndeniably, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are the stars of the film and are a large part of its greatness, but it is also Michael Mann's (\"Collateral,\" \"Manhunter\") unique eye and story-telling sense that defines the film as well. Despite his insuppressible style, the film still retains a gritty, realistic air that is best evidenced in a shootout that takes place in the Los Angeles streets. Without a doubt, this is the director's masterpiece and definitely one of the best of its kind. It's a true epic that is filed to the brim with intense acting (nobody's forgotten about you either, Val) and complicated characters as intricate as the job they are trying to do. For all intents and purposes, \"Heat\" lives up to its name. 5 stars   5-24-13",

Neither can live while the other survives.\n\nTop shelf actors give their all here, and between the unbeatable heart-pounding shootout (perfect without any music), the heartfelt character moments, a suicidal Natalie Portman, a TV's untimely demise, and an almost artistic final showdown at an airport, Heat is the crime epic to beat.",

In terms of the \"cops and robbers\" genre, this undeniably takes the cake and some, with a phenomenal cast (Pacino and De Niro have never been better, and get great help from Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, etc.) that keeps this long, winding thriller arresting throughout its duration. This has been one of my favorite films for many years, and it is one that I never get tired of watching over and over again. It's dense, sure, and there are certain wrinkles in the story that take multiple views to understand completely. Ultimately, this is a top-notch crime movie which even deals with interpersonal relationships that fall apart which becomes so tragic and poignant. Michael Mann has cemented him self as an action director to be reckoned with. it's a movie that should be seen just for the fact that you get to see two of the best actors ever in Pacino and De Niro go against one another. if  you wanna see in simplicity great... great acting with such a high level of integrity then watch this movie starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro who are two titans sharing the screen for the first time in history in american cinema with a legendary showdown.",

            "content": "One of the great crime movies.\n\nMichael Mann writes and directs Heat, an incredibly smart crime thriller which follows a hugely successful criminal looking to get out of the game after one last hit, and an obsessive cop hunting to get him behind bars. Robert De Niro plays Neil McCauley, an experienced robber, known for tackling banks and armoured vehicles. McCauley's success has cost him a personal life, not allowing himself to get distracted by any relationships. Al Pacino plays Vincent Hanna, an L.A.P.D. cop putting everything he has into finding McCauley, which also results in a lack of family life. Divorced twice, Hanna is absent in his third marriage. Which of these lonely men will succeed?\n\nMy brief synopsis doesn't even begin to tap into the huge amount of detail and characters in this near 3 hour film. Mann's Heat is definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past 20 years with action scenes worthy of Tarantino and the use of location and camera shot is simply superb. Although the film is so very long and nothing immensely new is done, Mann delivers a truly great crime movie.\n\nWhen you see that the stars of the film are Pacino and De Niro, you can't help but want to watch the film. However, Mann only puts the two together in a few scenes with both putting in solid individual performances. Pacino over-acts his way through the film, which is not a bad thing as it surprisingly works. Much of his time is spent shouting at people and delivering orders, which allow the more dramatic scenes to add more to Pacino's character.\n\nPurposely opposite to Hanna is De Niro's McCauley whose calm and and restricted demeanour creates a character that just breaths lonesome determination for the job at hand. Heat also has a stunning supporting cast which includes Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner.\n\nStunningly brilliant crime thriller although very very long.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n8.5/10.",

De Niro, a methodical mastermind criminal who wants to get out and lead a peaceful life or Pacino, the cunning cop who has a disastrous personal life.

That isn't necessarily a bad thing though but it doesn't suit Pacino or DeNiro as well as other roles do. I think DeNiro handles himself better out of the two here- there's an element of control and pace to his performance where as Pacino seems to be all guns blazing throughout, which is good for the scenes where guns are actually blazing but not so great for other moments. \n\nThere's a hell of a supporting cast here too and they are all pretty strong. I think that's the real success of this movie- the formula in this film begins as an already pretty used one and even with such big names at the top, that isn't enough to save it and make  it stand out. What does make it stand out though is the roles of the supporting cast who make this a collective success. \n\nIt's thoroughly entertaining and stands out against many of it's counterparts- it's possibly a modern classic but it doesn't have the originality it needs to match the real classics.

            "content": "I've seen director Michael Mann's three hour masterpiece Heat four times, thanks to HBO and Netflix, and a recent reviewing the other night has convinced me I ever was of it's greatness. Maybe it's just a guy thing where the typical male obsessions, like guns, cars, violence, are elevated to potentially embarrassing levels of reading, but the ironically named Mann has the cool style to pull off the task. \"Cool\" and \"style\" are the important words to remember.It's a heist film as tragedy, and its particularly arresting to seeing the un-bottled rage of Pacino's dogged cop contrasted with the coolly methodical criminal of DeNiro set against the expansive , cluttered , over lit loneliness that constitutes Mann's idea of Los Angeles. Mann'>Mann is in control of his materials, and his decision to limit the amount of shared screen time between his top billed stars was smart indeed; rather than a conventional vehicle plot geared to accommodate big stars in uninteresting situations, we get ins study in distinct and not-so distinct contrasts as the competing personalities and their agendas head to an ending where only one, or neither of them is standing. Mann at his best gets the hard-boiled genre where all a man has going for him is his professionalism and the personal code that comes with it, and Heat to me is an intriguing extension of the style.\n\nSome critics were alarmed by what they felt was Mann's reluctance to have feeling for human relationships -we are in the country of stoic individuals conducting themselves by codes of honor and conduct that places weight on action, not words and their adjectives--the movie is about human relationships reduced to the occupations that command everything; emotional attachments are a luxury the characters, cops and crooks alike, cannot afford. This is a given in heist dramas, but little, really, has been done to show the devastation that The Life has the personal level. Pacino has grudgingly accepted the isolation his work has forced him into, and pursues DeNiro without let up, whatever the cost to himself or those around him. DeNiro's character, in turn, has a code that says, in effect, that someone in the life needs to be ready, always, to abandon whoever and whatever is around them the minute they know the \"heat\" is around the corner; the tragedy is slowly set into motion as he violates his own code, his rules for existing in the life he's chosen, and attempts to take his girlfriend with him. His end is inevitable. Heat's success, for me, is the way Mann expands the minimalist conventions of the narrative line and examines the irrevocable ruin in human relations that the characters' choices result in.\n\nI don't know about the characters being unrealized, since I think this is in the tradition of Hemingway wherein blatant introspection is nil, but much is conveyed through a series of small details, glances, scars. Perhaps you don't see it, but there's a lot that is said between the lines here, and the acting--Jon Voight is particularly effective here with his restraint, among others--creates a tangible feeling of emotional attachment being hammered into silence by a rough trade. The bit with Pacino's daughter is the least convincing thing in the film; my impression is that Mann had four to five hours of film he had to edit to an hour. This is obviously a truncated storyline that should have been excised from the film. But it's a flaw I can live with..Mann has been taken to task for not making his case about alienation by subtler means, without resorting, as one critic wrote \"....to extremism because the vast majority of people never get so mesmerized by their jobs that they lose their humanity the way De Niro does.\" The complaint , of course, is that Mann loves the build up to a grand explosion of feeling where only a character's capacity for ballistic reaction can satisfy the need. Mann, though, I think is well in the tradition of theatrical tragedy, as DeNiro's character's, master thief, thorough professional, a planner who makes no mistakes in his agendas, assumes that he can defy the odds against getting caught and thus assumes his carefully articulated professionalism will shield him from unlucky happenstance. He is a sufferer of unwarranted pride, a carrier of hubris who claims credit for all that great around him. Tragic form demands that the Universe correct itself, since one thing corresponds with everything else within the dramatic frame, equilibrium must be reestablished.\n\nHeat is a tragedy, and tragedies require extremism. There is no more extremism here than you'd find in Shakespeare. This isn't saying that Mann's work here equals The Bards, but only that the outsized action we witness is in perfect scale with the tragic form. It operates at the appropriate level. Heat is a movie, and movies generally demand \"extremism.\" Movies are required to be \"larger than life\", perhaps, but \"extremism\" here is a generic requirement of both tragedy and the noir aspects Mann is working in. The conventions of the narrative style don't allow for the middle ground, the kind of emotional richness that are reserved for the civilians of the world, with straight jobs that have regular hours. The minimal and the maximal are the options in this case, and Mann does a what I think is a credible job of getting something operatic from this story of two men , bereft of other human satisfaction and nuance, plunge ahead to an inescapably bad ending. The scale of the Heat works beautifully.",

            "content": "Heat sounded perfect from every conceivable direction, being a Michael Mann film starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Val Kilmer all in the one film.\n\nHeat really failed to impress me as much as I might have hoped. I wasn't that disappointed with the fact that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro rarely interacted on screen because after reading up on the film it was what I expected, but I simply founded Heat to be a dull crime thriller film for much of the time.\nThe script in Heat is good because it intelligently looks into the minds of its characters well and has them bring their thoughts to the surface, but it plays out against the backdrop of a largely dull plot which moves along very slowly and doesn't prove to be really going anywhere anytime soon which leaves it rather unsatisfying. I mean, for a film that boasts both Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as a film that falls into the action genre, it doesn't have the actors interacting nearly enough and the quantity of action is very insufficient. After a quick explosion and one or two deaths within a timeframe of less than about 20 seconds, there is none for the first hour. The first 100 minutes of the film is full of nothing but a lot of talking which may wear down viewers who are waiting for the intense and climactic crime drama and action to really kick off. From there, Heat takes a massive step up. But I can say for sure that some audiences will have walked away from the film before the end of its first 100 minutes bored and having taken nothing from Heat.\nOnce the action kicks off, Heat becomes entertaining suddenly. It is a shame there was such a long wait for it, but considering the quality of it, it was largely worth the wait. Then suddenly it is over and we are back to a lot of talking again which drags the experience back into slow and boring territory all over again. It was by this point that I had essentially given up on Heat because I accepted that the quantity of action was not going to be sufficient and that the character drama was simply not of interest to me. So regardless of what is said, Heat simply is not an action film. It is a crime thriller, but it has a few too many characters and doesn't keep its focus very strong, allowing it to go all over the place to the downfall of the film. \nMichael Mann simply fails to tie Heat together. He doesn't give it the appropriate pacing to cover its excessive length of 170 minutes or enough visual stimulus to prove appealing, and so it is not the most involving film. While the way it chronicles two main characters on opposing ends of the events is interesting, it attempts to explore many more of the characters who becomes involved in it all, but Michael Mann follows to find the appropriate balance to make it work and leaves the story to go in many directions without ever sticking to a singular path. This manages to make the structure of events scattershot though consistently following a rather glacial pace. Despite being a rather convincing film that benefits from true life roots and is made to look stylish with Michael Mann's keen eye for strong cinematography and scenery as well as a dramatically effective musical score, there simply was not enough to make up for its bloated length and slow pace, nor was there enough action to justify calling it an action film whatsoever. There is less action in Heat than there is in Scarface, and you wouldn't call Scarface an action film so don't do it this time either.\nHeat does manage to benefit from a strong cast though.\nAl Pacino never lets a film down as the lead actor, and so Heat is no different. Keeping his performance within the intense conventions of a crime thriller, Al Pacino delivers his lines with a fierce dramatic strength and power. The performance isn't his best nor is it as good as his later collaboration with Michael Mann on The Insider, but the natural strength and charisma that Al Pacino delivers to his lead role in Heat is undeniable and plays out to benefit the dramatic effect of the film. His facial gestures fuel the intensity of the film becauase they serve as a portal to his mind, and the tense strengthi in his line delivery is nothing but beneficial to Heat.\nBut Robert De Niro is the screen stealer. Following a similar path to Al Pacino in terms of maintaining a sense of sophistication in his strength as an actor, Robert De Niro manages to make more out of his part and delivers a memorable and intense performance which no other cast member is able to match up to in Heat. You can see the intensity in his soul through the glare in his eyes and the quiver in his lip, and his quick and sharp line delivery just add to the strength of his character. Robert De Niro's strong and tense effort in Heat is undeniable and he is the true screen stealer.\nVal Kilmer's interactions with the many other cast members in Heat manage to establish some interesting relationships in various scenes which serve to benefit his character, but his effort feels somewhat routines.\nTed Levine has a natural skill for portraying villains and has done so various times in his career, so in Heat it is good to see him taking on a more heroic role which he manages to do with ease and natural skill. His line delivery is naturally strong and benefits Heat without problem.\nAny film that casts Danny Trejo as a supporting villain deserves praise for recognising the man's talents and using him to better their film. Even though he has a small amount of screen time, Danny Trejo is simply a memorable face for being in Heat.\nLastly, Natalie Portman's small presence in the film is also a nice touch, and it is good to see her active in her youth.\n\nBut despite a powerful cast led by legends Al Pacino and Robert De Niro combined with a strong visual style, Heat is an overblown and dull crime thriller film which is very long but short on action which isn't the best of Michael Mann's work.",

With the chemistry that plays out between Pacino & De Niro, and the very important facet of their dueling roads in life effectively mirroring one another, few films have touched me, personally, in such a powerful way. Pacino's character, Hannah, represents the side of the law, unflinching in his duties no matter what comes before him. De Niro's McCauley, on the other hand, represents the cold-blooded con-man, unflinching in his quest for the next big score. Both have their quarrels to deal with given their trades of choice, and both wonder what it'd be like to try for a change in their tumultuous trappings, but both can't deny the rush, and the passion that brings them back. All of this hits home, very hard, in the closing scene. Indeed, as of this writing I had just shed one of my last tears having finished a viewing session of the film minutes ago. Few films elicit a powerful response since it's a raw, human plot point, made eternally fantastic through the talents of De Niro & Pacino.         \n\nThere's no denying the heist scene, of course, but that's not the appeal of the film, at least to me.",

Most people really do like this movie but I personally did not find Pacino and De Niro's characters very compelling. The point of the movie is to point out how much the cops and robbers in this story have in common as their careers occupy their whole lives. I do not like how there is no strong sense of who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. It is conflicted and makes it hard to invest in one side over the other. All of the main characters have dysfunctional family lives or lack of family life. The women in these men's lives are swept under the rug and are always a second thought. Sure the acting is good and the characters thoughts are deeper than most movies, but when you do not have a horse in the race it fails to resonate with me, no matter how true to life that may be. The story is unremarkable and the characters are all fairly dislikable.",
