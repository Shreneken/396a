    "summary": "When retiring police Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) tackles a final case with the aid of newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt), they discover a number of elaborate and grisly murders. They soon realize they are dealing with a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who is targeting people he thinks represent one of the seven deadly sins. Somerset also befriends Mills' wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is pregnant and afraid to raise her child in the crime-riddled city.",

The movie's third act is haunting and enthralling leading up to a shocking ending that makes the slow buildup to that point worth it. Morgan Freeman puts up a great performance as detective Somerset and is easily the highlight of the cast.",

The film's thesis pretends to be that we should fight for our world, but the problem is it never commits to that thesis. John Doe, a pathetic, broken loser, wins at pretty much every step, right up until Freeman's wild tone shift with his hopeful speech that he gives despite not earning. Doe is never analyzed critically beyond what he says he is\u2014the thing that serial killers want people to do with them\u2014so the movie never grapples with the fact that his plot is laughable. The Seven Deadly sins thing is so surface level and lazy that it's clear Doe is just hiding behind a layer of sophistication, and his actual motivations, like most killers, are because he hates women, himself, and his society. But the movie pretends like he's much smarter than that as he executes a plan built on an elementary school understanding of Biblical thought. Any attempt to analyze it is undone by the fact that he keeps winning despite his nonsense plans. The writing consistently fails this movie, and it's obvious to me that it held together by Fincher's direction and some stellar performances.\n\nWatch it as a fun, pulp thriller and don't try to analyze it very much, it only pretends to have substance, and once you go beneath that, you only start to see flaws.",

That aside, the movie is a dumpster-fire mess, badly written, with occasional hilariously ridiculous lines, and with silly plot devices built clumsily around a \"seven deadly sins\" theme that allows for grisly scenes of corpses and near-corpses to appear from time to time. The exterior action scenes, which seem to have been scissored in, are strictly network TV cop-show material, though even a network TV cop show would be embarrassed to have all those cop cars screeching up to a crime scene as if choreographed. There seems to be no explicable reason for Gwyneth Paltrow's  presence except that someone reading the script decided a well-known female character was needed to secure funding, and Paltrow's agent held out for a long and pointless scene at a diner with the avuncular Freeman.",

By removing the 'Judas' from the script, he placed his killer (Kevin Spacey) in the role of his own arresting officer, his own judge, and executioner of his 'judgments.'\n\nWalker's killer gives himself up, teasing Mills (Brad Pitt) and Somerset (Morgan Freeman) to tears. Mills agonizes over the box that contains the severed head of his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), while Somerset shouts himself hoarse, asking him not to look inside. \n\nWalker pens his killer in complete control right up to the finale, in which he murders Tracy, whose life he envies, and goads Mills, her wrath-ridden husband, to shoot him in the head. The terrible twins of Envy and Wrath are dispensed with in one fell swoop \u2013 brilliant authorship! \n\nWalker weaves the Seven Deadly Sins (Pride, Greed, Lust, Envy, Gluttony, Wrath, and Sloth) into his killer's diabolical plan while drawing inspiration from Dante, Milton, and Chaucer. He gives Somerset a break in the investigation in that the book-reading killer may have a library card with his address on it. \n\nIn essence, Walker pens an emotional breakdown in Se7en and invites the audience down into the centrifuge to experience it. \n\nHis other writing credits include 8mm, Sleepy Hollow, and Wolfman.\n\nPeace!\n\nWords, Tommy Peters.\n\n#sevenmovie #andrewkevinwalker @karisma_jay_",

This thing was relentlessly intriguing, slick, and grim. Fincher's direction just demands your attention and he takes you on a thrilling and disturbing ride all the way up to the gut-wrenching and haunting finale. Going in, I knew this was the \"what's in the box\" movie but had managed to avoid any spoilers. Once we started getting to that point in the movie and after having understood the tone they were going for, I predicted what the final twist would be. However, even though I saw it coming, the finale lost none of its shock value or gripping and harrowing tone, which is a testament to how perfectly it was done. This is one of the best endings to a movie I've seen and it's an ending that's going to stick with me for a long time. The film is an example of the mystery thriller genre at its best, and elevated by its ending.",

For all of \"Se7en's\" heaviness, the subtly comic antagonism between the Pitt and Freeman characters provides a sly and riveting counterpoint against the dreary and perpetually rainy backdrop of the dirty city. In deliberate fashion, the film progresses along a brutal trajectory that culminates in exactly the kind of shocking climax that such a film requires to maintain thematic consistency. The overall picture that the film paints is uncompromising; devastating even, yet its artfulness is ever apparent as the film lures us in with its cruel and yet bleakly elegant symphony of events. \"Se7en\" is one of those rare films which I wish that I could see all over again for the first time in order to experience its shocks anew, yet on a certain level, one almost requires the security inherent in knowing what's to come.",

The newly appointed detective Mills joins soon-to-retire detective Sommerset (why do they always have to be on their final week before retirement?) on the hunt for a maniac that doesn't leave any traces.\n\nTo start of, this movie is clearly made by David Fincher and that is to be felt in every detail. There's a lot of attention given to the technical part of a police investigation, as well as the gruesome details that come with working a crime scene. The thing that stands out about this movie is the constant presence of this serial killer that is clearly steps ahead, and the pressure from working on a case where the only possibility seems waiting for the next victim to turn up. You feel the same frustration as the detectives are capable at their jobs but simply can't do much against a person that seemingly doesn't make mistakes.\n\nThat brings us to a negative as well, as toward the latter third of the movie some things seem to progress a little too easy. A few coincidences play in the main character's favours, which doesn't seem to match everything the movie was doing in the first two acts. Luckily the ending picks up and Seven tops it off with a visceral gutpunch along with great performances by everyone involved.\n\nSeven -- 8/10",

The famous \"What's in the box?\" scene I believe is the greatest plot twist ever, and left me frozen for 15-20 minutes after the movie was over.

Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Back then everyone didn't have a mobile phone, not even NYPD detectives, and computers were something they used for fingerprint files. However, few films from that age, if any, still feel so modern as Se7en. Seeing Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey when they weren't overused but relatively fresh faces might be a factor that evokes this, but there's just something about the cinematographic style in this film that seems to have paved way for how just about every film in and around the same genre has looked stylistically ever since. The way Se7en is filmed, edited and colorized is so main school that it looks fresh even in 2022, despite the lack digital gadgets. Though it's not a copy of Silence of the Lambs, the trendsetter from four years earlier, they have many more characteristics in common than a solid serial killer plot and displaying profound psychologial features. Se7en also has several direct hints and tiny kicks to its paragon, but it obviously is and directly tries to be darker and more repulsive, quite successfully so. Regardless, despite their similarities they are both unique in their own way, and though Se7en is much more of a milestone in cinematic style innovation, Silence of the Lambs will always be the super classic, with Se7en as a very good second best.",

So many films situated around a serial killing utilizing the seven deadly sins as an M.O. would fall horrifically short, but Fincher's direction oversees a reversal of this imaginable failure. I could imagine this idea ineptly in the mold of that horrific piece of cinema, Hangman, with gratuitious gore put up on a pedestal and being utilized in place of an actual plot and actual acting. Not here.\n\nThe film has a certain appealing, nonspecific bleakness about it that frames it perfectly. All of the film takes place in some unnamed city with rampant crime. The audience feels Freeman's weariness and exasperation and sympathizes with Pitt coming in as an outsider, still a baby in terms of what he has yet to experience. Paltrow also plays a role in establishing the setting, though, surprisingly, she only had several scenes. The film would have benefitted from a bit more levity that the film relied upon her for, as it became slightly monotonous with its griminess in the second half.\n\nFreeman and Pitt work really well together, even if their characters remain static until the final chapter. Pitt as a young, hungry, impatient idealist brings a freneticism to counter Freeman's calm, collected, disillusioned view. Kevin Spacey really brings the final part of the film to life. The audience is left to wonder how the film was even entertaining before he began speaking and completely altering the landscape of the plot. Never has a character been so despicable yet gripping, and every frame Spacey occupies gives off an air of perfection. The ending is cinematic perfection and a perfect reversal of the gore and disgust projected earlier in the film. The most disturbing things are those that we cannot see.",

David Fincher's classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I've ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer's mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher's trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie's incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it's the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it's a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made\u2026. I can't recommend it more.\"",

First of all, characters of Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey look very good, you believe in every emotion that they show, as well as they play very serious and realistic.

The quotes that characters say are instantly classic, as everybody knows about \"WHAT'S IN THE F***ING BOX?!\" without even seeing this movie, which just shows it's cult status. The plot is breathtaking and interesting, way better than most of the modern thrillers and is very original and unpredictable. I will have this plot in memory for a long time from now on, as of how great it is. The music perfectly sets the tone for every scene and is put in a great place. Operator's job is done wonderfully, all the shots are taken interestingly and sometimes make it so that what the characters are witnessing is kept in secret and that works STUNNING in the final scene. The final of this movie is just something worth watching this movie for. A strong 9/10, everybody should check that out, as it is a classic now and is a great thought provoking thriller!

However, upon watching it again as an adult, I now realize how much I had missed, as well as how it could be a masterpiece, depending on how one interprets the final few scenes.\n\nMy scrutiny begins and ends with the astounding utilization of the last two of the seven deadly sins: envy and wrath. Before John Doe (Kevin Spacey) turns himself in, Mills (Brad Pitt) receives a note from his wife, which he never gets a chance to read. Whilst the three men, Somerset (Morgan Freeman), Mills and John Doe drive to the location with the \"last two bodies\", John Doe clearly and passionately states that he only kills those who are not innocent. This is especially important, as Mills' wife, from everything we know as the audience, which, in turn, is everything John Doe could possibly know about her, is an innocent person. When they arrive, they find a corpse of a wild dog, to which John Doe declares, \"I didn't do THAT\", emphasizing the \"THAT\", which helps answer Mills' question, \"What's in the box?\"\nNot a part of Mills' wife, but rather, his dog.\nWrath can only be exercised if there is no \"revenge\" involved, as that would be \u2018lex talionis' or \u2018an eye for an eye', not blind rage. Knowing that John Doe is not an idiot who would suddenly go against his own rules, especially for the grand finale, he could effortlessly shape the situation to bring out the wrath from Mills through this final \"test\" without having to harm innocent civilians. Somerset, having seen what is in the box prior to Mills, realizes the dire situation he had put Mills in by leaving him alone with John Doe, who is able to easily manipulate and agitate Mills. However, Somerset is unable to tell Mills what is in the box, as that would ultimately allow John Doe to win the \"game\", simultaneously disallowing Somerset to determine whether or not Mills is ready to fill in his shoes once he retires from the police department. Ultimately, Mills kills John Doe without knowing what is box, exercising wrath and losing the \"game\". In the final scene, we see that Mills is dispirited, perhaps from finally reading the note his wife left him, only to realize that she is well, and that he had just become a sinner. Somerset decides to stay \"around\", as he has failed to find a worthy successor, who he believed could be Mills, had he passed John Doe's test.\n\nThis rather far-fetched take on the ending is not only plausible, but for the sake of Se7en's character continuity, also logical. Even the Se7en Wiki suggests that Mills' wife is dead, which is frivolous and perfunctory, especially given that the director clearly left the final scenes to be interpreted by the audience. Much like young me, countless theatergoers were and still are unable to see the possibilities in Se7en that completely alter the ending.\n\nThe true sin in this film was apathy and inattention; the sinners being Somerset and other citizens of Bardach County. Ironically, most of us take significant scenes at face value, unable to care or think twice about our ugly world, committing the same sins as those in Se7en.\n\n- Spark Vulpa",

While it takes the premise of the typical buddy cop movie - a pair of police officers, one experienced and one green, hunting a bad guy - it is far more Insomnia or The Silence of the Lambs than Lethal Weapon. The environments are too decayed, the murders too grisly, and the setting too cynical to fit neatly into the genre. Yet, it is not exactly a serial killer film either - there is a greater emphasis on the interactions between the two partnered detectives than between the detectives and the killer. The result is a film that is sometimes difficult to watch but is also unique and innovative. On top of the quotable dialogue and dark imagery which give the film its distinctive tone, the film also features a tour de force performance by Morgan Freeman as the jaded Detective Somerset, and excellent chemistry between him and the other lead, Brad Pitt playing the young, rash Detective Mills.",

It's themes are pretty in your face, really holding it's message right up to your nose. Not just with the Deadly Sins aspect, but also in the darkness of the world and the old cop style versus new cop.  However, the themes are good, and possibly more relevant now than when the film first came out.  And I like the themes of the movie, they never feel outright heavy-handed, but appropriate and interesting.  I also love the look of the film.  It's grimy and gross and you can almost smell it, but it's that disgusting New York crime film that has a distinct vibe and style.  It's a thrilling story, and you want to see it solved, and seeing the two cops figure it out and slowly get closer themselves is a definitely a bit tropey but it's still enjoyable.  The funny thing with it is I knew some of the spoilers to this movie (\"what's in the box?\") so I had an idea where it was going, but seeing it get there was still a great ride.  That being said, knowing that made me realize one of these characters really gets the shaft here.  It's hard to say too much without deliving into spoilers, but there is a character who gets treated more as a plot device than anything else.  That being said, I still really liked the film.  It's got great tension, acting, and an overall style.",

Pitt and Morgan play off of each other very well.  I really enjoyed the intimate, nearly claustrophobic sensation the film's setting gives off.  A gritty, nearly colorless descent into the deep streets of what looks like NY, in pursuit of a serial killer who murders victims based on the 7 deadly sins.  The foreboding score deserves some praise too as it successfully helps in maintaining the grimness.  Top to bottom, I didn't find 'Se7en' to be Fincher's most engaging work; I personally prefer Fight Club and Social Network.  The first act paled in comparison to the 2nd and 3rd as well.

Seven was suspenseful in every moment it reveals clues to its mystery and thrilling in a way that you feel excited and at the same time fear of what will happen next. And those factors are what made it a commendable movie story worth your time to watch. Another worth to see in this film were the notable acting performances of Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt who both played contrasting yet complementing character that made this film a stand-out. Freeman played a mature geek cop William Somerset while Pitt played a hardheaded young cop David Mills. Both of which were outstanding character in the story. And both were greatly given character justices by the stellar performance of Freeman and Pitt. While Kevin Spacey as John Doe even for a supporting role gave a remarkable balance among the two lead characters and contributed to the critical turn in the story of Seven.",

I love the poster and it works so well after you watch it and you will understand after you watch it just wanted to point that out. This is a character study if you think about it and Brad Pitt you can sympathize with him what he does at the end or I can at least sympathize with him with what he does at the end.\n\nThis movie is one of the greats that still holds up and will get better than it already is with time. This movie has a ton of tension in the third act in the final scenes and it is so good. The acting in this movie is amazing and the showcase of emotion in the final scenes by Brad Pitt is just amazing and he steals the whole show with Morgan Freeman in each scene they steal each scene they are in. The script and dialogue are amazing it feels so real just like Insomnia. The score in this movie is haunting and it sets the tone for the whole movie an unsettling nature. The cinematography is amazing, I love the shot placement it just looks amazing and the color correction looks amazing and the editing in the final scenes is amazing and the whole movie has amazing editing. I love the chase scene in this movie and it is one of the best chase scenes in film and it is one of my favorites, I'm glad they don't use a shakey cam and go behind Brad the whole time.

Unlike many other movies made during and since its release, Se7en refrains from gore and somehow becomes even more appalling because of it. Over time, general audiences have been desensitized to violence and gore. What may have been considered absolutely horrifying back in the 50s is nothing nowadays. So instead of showing the results of the crime, director David Fincher uses a somewhat Hitchcockian technique; by refraining to show the results of the horrible acts committed, and instead of revealing it through dialogue and acting, notably in the 'LUST' scene and 'SLOTH' scene, Fincher lets our brain do the heavy lifting and figure out what happened, and what it must have felt like. Fincher also goes out of his way to come up with the most disgusting ways a person can die, although some are admittedly tame. ('PRIDE' had it easy) The acting is incredible, featuring one of Morgan Freeman's best performances as an old, broken-down police detective, and Brad Pitt in one of his finest roles, and his acting skills are on display in his explosive acting during the finale. However, the best actor in this movie is the actor who plays John Doe. Observe his acting. Smug, self-satisfied, intelligent, analytical. His composure and fearlessness. The movie rests on this one actor to say every line perfectly. He does. His performance is just as affecting as Anthony Hopkin's in Silence of the Lambs. But the most impressive feat of all, David Fincher does something impossible: he makes the villain seem like a hero. It is hard to explain, but there are some villains that give us a glimpse into our deepest, subconscious desires. And that's terrifying. We all have parts of ourselves that we try to hide and pretend don't exist. These types of villains hold up a mirror and say, look. This is you. It's like watching a perverted car wreck that you can't look away from that hits you somewhere deep and hidden.",

I thought the movie would hold more value than that but it doesnt. It is directed well and it is acted well and it has a creepy vibe. However the subject matter is gruseome and depressing and the bad guy wins at the end. What possible enjoyment can be taken from that?",

Opening eyes to the fact that the banality of evil that plagues us is really more than it appears, and something that can't be erased from life, but is something we should try to fight back against, instead of choosing to ignore \n",

The atmosphere of the film is perfectly balanced and it creates tension in every scene it needs to, but without taking the thrill of the persecutions, the fights and the suspense. In addition, the casting was brilliantly picked because each actor gets under the skin of their respective character and plays them perfectly. For example, Brad Pitt\u00b4s and Gwyneth Paltrow\u00b4s chemistry in the movie is palpable to the audience making you feel every emotion they feel. Still, each character manages to be self sufficient for itself.\nIn my opinion, this movie is Morgan Freeman\u00b4s best performance ever because he manages to keep a balance between the case and personal issues while being involved in other people\u00b4s problems as well. He gets the essence of his character because he is the typical play by the rules guy, but suprises you when you see he is also willing to do whatever he needs to get done to get the job done.\nFinally, I think everyone should watch this movie (if you are old enough) because it gives you an insight in serial killer\u00b4s motivations and purposes and the consequences of their actions. Personally, I enjoyed this movie a lot just because it kept me hooked up to the story from the very beginning and completely blew my mind with the end. \n",

Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt have polar personalities, where Freeman is a calm, orderly senior and Brad Pitt is, of course, the hot heated rookie that rushes into situations head on. For most of the movie, the conflict is between these two trying to acknowledge one another while still trying to find the murderer.\nEverything seems to come into peaceful synergy once they come close to capturing the enemy, the only problem is that the killer has managed to get too close to one of them. After almost killing one of them, the killer gains an interest in him and begins to unravel his emotional state. As the two have the murderer in cuffs, in the middle of the desert, he manages to get a package delivered to them. With this package, everything that was built up and sustained till now completely falls apart and the situation falls into the killer's hands.\nThis movie really reminds me of the fragile instability of our emotions. Even as we work to overlook our natural tendencies, it will always be a part of us. This world requires us to hide our evil away and work with others only using our cooperative traits. When push comes to shove, we cannot help but unleash the primal emotions we have, even if it risks self-destruction.",

That very effect is a prominent factor for this still shocking crime thriller, especially towards the gripping final act as the film's most definite scene after all the twist and turn buildups and credibly committed stellar, some may say effortless, performances from the cast in embracing one of the finest neo-noir flairs and intellect complexity shadowed by the brutally grim atmosphere. Entertaining by the narrative and effective deliverance, though it's not exactly perfect by self-proclamation due to the sensibly disrupted self-contradiction being muddled into the small frantically responsive scene to the final, devastating shocker.

It focuses on dark and brutal themes of mystery and horror and it has that very evocative story that'll keep you on the edge of your seat whilst Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are witnessing the horrors of the seven deadly sins, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. Whoever uses those sins as motives in murders is John Doe and he cut his own fingertips so that the police and two detectives, David Mills and William Somerset won't know who killed these victims but Mills and Somerset do know it's John Doe who committed these horrible crimes. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have great chemistry together on-screen to have the mystery to solve the seven deadly sins in this creepy cruel world where sins and crimes are committed including in bad weather 'cause the filmmakers wanted to make the atmosphere look gritty and dark. David Fincher has his reputation for making his films and cinematography look gritty, brutal and dark as I said in his previous films. The twist at the end is brutal, it's amazing. The box has something inside and Mills know that someone's head is inside and he says that one line that everyone knows about is \"What's in the box?\" and he has the great chase scene between him and Doe. Both of these scenes are suspenceful. I love Se7en and Se7en is an brutal and dark edge of the seat neo-noir crime thriller that will keep you invested for some mystery and thrills by David Fincher. There is another films that stars Brad Pitt and directed by David Fincher is Fight Club and I am interested in checking it out because of David Fincher's directing style and cinematography. If anybody hasn't seen Se7en, I would recommend you go watch it and if anybody who hates the film, they are totally sinned. I know that's just a catchphrase but that's just the way it is for people who hated Se7en.",

A great police procedural crime thriller, one of the best, and probably director David Fincher's best, at least in my opinion.

            "content": "Seven is shocking and disturbing!\n\nDavid Fincher's horrifying homicide detective procedural Se7en (1995) is a gripping thriller and disgusting display of human depravity. The murders are so explicit and grisly that Seven will make your stomach churn. The ghastly serial killings are so shocking and disturbing in nature that I have those scenes burned into my memory forever. It is like Fincher wanted the audience to experience how depressing and nihilistic detectives must feels after constantly witnessing the worst humanity has to offer.\n\nSeven's story, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, is simple enough. A new hopeful detective works alongside his older experienced weary detective, who must learn to work together to capture a monstrous serial killer, as their ideals clash. Seven pulls this ideological conflict and philosophical debate to the backdrop of violent atrocity. \n\nFincher's slow burn direction builds up suspense into rushes of adrenaline with his upsetting murder reveals, brilliant chase sequence, final twist, and distressing suffering. Se7en is Fincher's masterpiece painting attempted with a brush covered in blood. I cannot decide if Fincher just wanted to frighten every audience that watches Seven or if he wanted to depict the torturous existence of a man of the law. I think it's fair to say Se7en accomplishes both purposes.\n\nBrad Pitt is brilliant in Se7en as Det. David Mills. His hopeful, fresh face is a nice contrast to Morgan Freeman's weathered face. They are the perfect foil for each other really. The energetic, wild, if unorthodox brash style of Pitt's detective are well met against Freeman's thoughtful, researched, measured, calm method. The investigation unfolds with each new clue as their bonds grow. Pitt is particularly likable and funny as well as compelling during the action sequences. You completely believe his character's emotional swings and tense nature. Pitt makes you want Mills to catch the killer all the more so. I do not think that Se7en would be as engaging without Brad Pitt's endearing performance.\n\nMorgan Freeman is excellent as the experienced retiring Det. William Somerset. His tempered response to the violence and action around him is quite subtle. Freeman gives one of his career best performances in Se7en.\n\nSpeaking of career best acting, Kevin Spacey is chilling as John Doe. His cold and calm performance as a loathsome serial killer is unnerving, especially as he details his contempt for the people he murdered. His sudden indignant rage is also frightening unto itself.\n\nOn the other hand, Se7en features one of the few likable performances from actress Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills is really interesting as a supporting character and wife to Pitt's leading detective. Her plight of unhappiness in a new and dangerous environment is sympathetic, while Paltrow's reserved performance in the diner with Freeman is thoughtful. I really enjoyed Paltrow in Se7en.\n\nLastly, Howard Shore's score for Se7en gets as unnerving and suspenseful as the killings in the film. His blending of dark genres with a polished edge complements Fincher's immaculate eye for directing. Shore is as clever a composer as ever.\n\nOverall, Se7en is a film that everyone should seek out. It's a great display of multiple acting performances. Seven an entertaining movie and a technically marvelous film. The gross messy rooms for the setting and the dingy clothes are just the surface of despair in Se7en.",

Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) descend through the levels of hell, chasing their prey. The climax in the Ninth Circle of Hell - Treachery - provides a devastating twist.\n\nSe7en is an intense, disturbing, bleak, thrilling film. It is dark, and hopeless, and unrelenting. The cinematography portrays the city as dirty and horrifying, reveling in excess and filth. Despite that, it also manages to elicit a sense of life and soul. Despite the oppressive atmosphere, there is some hope to be found.\n\nSomerset and Mills are the perfect antithesis of each other. Where Somerset is pessimistic and defeated, Mills is hopeful and enthusiastic. Somerset sees only darkness in the world, and is incapable of believing that there is an end to it. Mills refuses to submit to the wickedness that lurks in each shadow, unwilling to allow it victory. Pitt and Freeman portray their characters well and their chemistry - rooted in their differences - is contagious.\n\nKevin Spacey is downright disturbing as John Doe. Though the character does not occupy much screen time, those few moments are captivating and chilling. The anonymity of the character, the fact that he could literally be anyone, is horrifying in its own right.\n\nSe7en is a film that one could view multiple times, and come away with something different each time. The correlation to Dante's Inferno is intriguing, and it's interesting to see the deadly sins manifest in Somerset and Mills themselves.\n\nIn a literal sea of crime thrillers, Se7en's unique qualities set it far and above its peers.",

Fincher's ability to draw out and heighten the tension is superb. Just when you think they have the killer and that everything can come to resolution, there's one more twist in the books. Toward the end of the film, when the three men are in the field it felt like it took forever for Morgan Freeman's character to open the box and reveal the contents. Even then, we still didn't know what was in it. I kept waiting for them to open it and show the contents, but I feel that it felt that much more compelling by not seeing it. Watching everything play out after that was truly incredible. The look of the film absolutely impacted my experience in watching it. The film was so incredibly well shot, and each shot was beautifully thought out. I loved the shots in the library when Morgan Freeman's character is studying. It might be my favorite sequence of the film. Having all of the green lights lit throughout the library added this beautiful and eerie element. I also enjoyed the dolly shots through the rows of books as if we were stalking his character and watching him. The shots in the field toward the end of the film are just beautiful. Including the overhead shots from the helicopter really feeds into John Doe, Somerset, and Mills and their isolation as their conflict bubbles over.",

Andrew Kevin Walker writes an amazing original screenplay which was a totally original and great idea for a story. Even though there's no doubt that the film definitely has a dark theme and has some disturbing scenes, overall it's really good. Brad Pitt and Morgan both give incredible performances as the two detectives trying to solve the case. Their chemistry together is really good. Kevin Spacey also does a good job, playing the antagonist/serial killer, but not as good as them. It's definitely scary and very intense until the end and there's always an eerie feeling.

This film takes on a symbolistic plot that is nothing too unfamiliar to an audience with a basic knowledge of religion or history.  The detective roles, played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, were played exceptionally well which comes as no surprise given these actors abilities.   The serial killer in this film has an intellectual feel which is nothing new in the crime genre.   Though the main aspect of this film, that gave it any purpose, was the anticipation and mystery that keeps the audience guessing and on the edge of their seats.  A lot of people tend to overlook the cinematography and sound of these films as if they took a back seat to the plot and actors, but the matter of the fact is that this film is beautifully orchestrated in that facet.   The perspective of the actors was presented so well that you could almost feel the emotions and thoughts of the characters, particularly in the closing scene with William and David.  The music choice for some of these scenes also seemed particularly different compared to your average film script, but I think people nowadays are looking for that different aspect in films which sets them apart from the others.  I think those that people who enjoy criminal and mystery genres are looking for the unpredictability of the script which is why this film, aside from its typical detective and crafty killer plot, gives anyone a reason to watch.  It's a thrill and a shock all mixed together in one emotion that never gets old no matter how many times I watch the film (ending is quite the climax ??).",

If you want to make a scary movie don't end it like that!  That's just funny.",

In my opinion, such pictures are generally the best\u00a0in the World Cinema.\u00a0Actions take place slowly, everything flows in its own way and there is not a single useful scene that does not belong to the plot. \u00a0The spectator watches the main characters\u00a0completely trusting them and they\u00a0in turn\u00a0quietly try to come to a logical conclusion and bring the matter to mind. \u00a0The main actors of this film: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. \u00a0These detectives, although completely different, but complement each other perfectly. \u00a0I want to highlight Pitt's game in the final scene. \u00a0It is striking how truthfully and sincerely he was able to convey his torment.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0The film \"Seven\" very much sunk into my soul. \u00a0And that's fine. \u00a0After viewing this picture, I began to think about such vital things that had never came to my mind before.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0We see mortal sin on every corner, in every house and we tolerate it, we tolerate it, because this is a common phenomenon.\u00a0(c)",

To call the type of effects used disturbing would be an understatement. Especially since the sloth victim is not an animatronic but a real person. Yes, David Fincher actually had a real person appear for that sin. The main villain is quite chilling and when he's onscreen, his line delivery is the best thing in this entire movie. Kudos to whoever wrote the script. Another thing I enjoyed is the excerpts from ye olde books about sins such as Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. For a movie all about sins, Se7en is mostly sinless, as in flawless. Why don't you have the people give the movie a maximum of a seven-star rating for this movie, RT? If IMDb can make a maximum out of 11 for This is Spinal Tap as a joke, you can give this movie a seven-star maximum as well. Quite fitting that this movie has an average rating of 7.7/10 on the Tomatometer, doesn't it? A classic mystery thriller.",

Pitt the hot headed emotional cop who is all in... and Freeman the grounded vet who can no longer bear witness to the travesties in the city that never sleeps.  In his limited screen time Spacey does great as well.  Se7en is a story that grabs your attention and holds it til the credits roll.  It shows New York as this dark grimy place... exactly like Gotham City.  Like it's a hell on earth.  It feels like it's always dark and gloomy.  The cinematography is great.  You really feel like you're in the city travelling from crime scene to crime scene with them.  Also the writing is really good even though some critics don't agree with that.  I can't understand for the life of me why this movie has such a \"low\" critics score (compared to the audience score).  It's a dark movie that will totally satisfy fans of dark thrillers and horrors.  It naturally gets a lot of comparisons to Silence of the Lambs, though they go about telling stories of serial killers in totally different ways.  But what they do have in common is that they're both masterpieces.  I highly highly recommend this movie.  Everyone should see it at least once in their life.",

What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever.\" Is an interesting line delivered at a major moment of revelation in Seven. I think its an interesting reflection of the movie itself too.\n\nI am not sure there is anything terribly sophisticated about Seven. There does not have to be for a good crime thriller to really work. I find when you describe this movie coldly and descriptively it all seems a little banal. There's an odd couple pairing of detectives, played by two pretty wonderful actors. The grizzled cop about to retire, who has spent a little too long in the game. The fresh, young and careless rookie, out to make a name for himself. Morgan Freeman is so perfectly that veteran with a commanding and ominous presence. Brad Pitt also works well as the rookie. \n\nThis film is also set against the most obvious of thriller settings, a relentlessly dark city, always raining or about to. A color scheme that never managed to lift its brush too far from grey. \n\nThere's some unique visceral imagery, the \"kills\" are haunting and troubling. Some are showed more than we want. Others I, frankly, wish I knew more, as the imagination is sometimes so much worse. Then there is the big reveal of our monster. Oh and what a reveal, what a commanding performance. Brief, menacing and psychologically domineering. \n\nIf you stop to think about this movie it is all a little preposterous, but who would? You are so busy taking it all in. You cannot really stop to pick apart the problems. \n\nI wrote through this dry shopping list of descriptors trying to work out what worked about the movie, a standard list of crime cliches it seems. Doing this exercise, I sort of realized what Seven reminded me of. It is a well done painting. If you strip it all down it is really predictable brush strokes and common themes. But it sings. It puzzles, and it draws you in for study. It's a masterful cop buddy piece. It is the right measure of brutality and imagination. The twists work. The reveal works. It works.\n\nThis movie reminds us why we have a conception of a script or formula for certain movies. Thrillers have things we've come to expect, the same can be said of every genre. Seven reminds you why this is the archetype for these movies. When you put the strokes together just right, it is really something to behold.",

Morgan Freeman delivers an excellent performance in the lead role, a quiet yet very calming and intelligent presence on screen, and he's well developed and by the film's conclusion a completely different person. Brad Pitt is also solid as the arrogant, yet dangerously committed rookie on the job. The contrast between the two sparks the film as it proceeds and provides for plenty authentic and very well executed character moments. The supporting cast is no less impressive, making the most of what they're given and filling in the roles of their caricatures. However, Kevin Spacey's John Doe is the true star of the film. Balancing a true act of patience and commitment to his actions, he's at once dangerous and meticulously smart but also firmly detached from his actions with an interesting morality. Although, it could have ended up being a typical dark mystery film, Se7en elevates its material by adding more substantial and thought to it's material as well as some very sharp execution. Using the seven sins as a focal point in the film was a very inspired and original move, and the film immediately sets the stakes for the film as events quickly descend onto horror. Its all capped off with an ending, that thanks to some very well placed foreshadowing and being masterfully executed, remains one of the most haunting and unforgettable in cinematic history. Through and through, David Fincher's direction permeates the experience, as the film establishes a dark and uncompromising tone that explores all the darkest reaches of humanity. It doesn't overdo the fact however with some light moments, but its also quite clear and apparent what the film is going to be and from the outset, you immediately know its not going to all end well. The effects work used in the film really enhance the detail in the film and add another layer of creativity and realism to the increasingly difficult killings that unfold across the film. Se7en is a dark and unforgettable myserty film that balances its uncompromising script with wry thought and a truly unforgettable ending. -",

However, his films' ability to consistently grip the viewer by the throat and not let go for two hours has stayed with me, and is one of the reasons why he is one of my top five directors working today.\n\nMy greatest regret is that I did not watch Se7en when it came out. Over the twenty-odd years that have passed since, it is no longer a surprise that Kevin Spacey is John Doe and we all have a pretty good idea what is in the box. Nonetheless, the film is slick and tight, two hours of pure suspense and action. It is refreshing to see some earlier work from both Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, and the odd couple shows that even the most distinct of actor pairings can produce the best of films. Dark to its core, Se7en is perhaps David Fincher's most unforgiving of films, and that is saying a lot (see: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). What to see next? Ah yes, Zodiac.",

However, it is a damn good film at that. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman make an excellent team, and Kevin Spacey is absolutely haunting as the killer. You probably won't recognize him, due to his shaved head. However, I've seen plenty of movies with Kevin Spacey, so I know exactly how his voice sounds.

When we need to see closer at the clues and hints that make us see clearly somethings. When we see from all perspectives and those involved when clues are everywhere. When we see they are where we least expect it when it's a game. When we need to see where it all stems from to see closer into the mind from a literary point of view. When what we are seeing isn't textbook behaviour when we are dealing with a pathological, sidistic, murder unlike we have seen before. When we see that we like doing things our way and alone to know we don't need help. When we wish to see somethings to get a closer look at some people. When we see that we wish to see other things when they bring us joy. When we can see from asking questions that we probe. When some things we see we shed a different light to it and perspective. When some clues speak to us when the person whom gives us the clues wants us to see it thst way. When we see that we need an extensive knowledge in our field. When everything we are seeing is new and meticulous that we are just seeing the beginning. When we see that we are just gathering everything first before we put them all together. When we see that we enjoy such cat & mouse chases. When we see this is not an easy open close case and can see the murder has a greater purpose. When we see we are lead from one place to another. When others wish to see when it makes for headline news. When you need to see to believe somethings we find. When we are not the only ones to see the odd when it's in our field to diagnosis the strange natural occurences. When we see that every clue leads to further research that we can reach and need others whom have access to reach. When we see that everyone has a price whether it's their life or monetary. When we see we are on the right track when we get closer to seeing whom could do such acts. When we see that we must chase after those whom we want to see. When we see we must follow protocol and procedures and follow by the rules we are given. When we see we must break the rules to follow the rules. When we see that we must be ready for anything that comes through those doors. When we see we are dealing with a professional whom know us and is one step ahead of us and can control steps. When we see that other people enjoy seeing what other see when it's their job. When we see that we came close to those whom we refuse to see, to know we will see things when we least expect it. When we can't see whom we are dealing with but can see only one person doing it when it's the devil. When we see we are going nowhere with any leads when the Devils hands are busy. When we see we are following by our own rules and we have to just follow along. When we see the devil doesn't want to be seen when they hide themselves when they are seen and unseen. When we see that we live according to our own system & laws. When we never thought we would see the devil until he reveals himself. When we see that we must bargain with those whom make us see more if what we don't want to already see but need to see to close this insanity once and for all. When we need to see that justice is done according to our laws. When others wish to see others see like we do when we want to see to the fullest when we demand everyone's attention.

When we see why we judge others while we are judged when our judgement is the only way we think others should see when we reveal that we aren't the devil, But people are when they allow things people see and do go unpunished.

When we see ourselves immortal when we are what we always saw ourselves a case that is worth noting, putting in books to reference and think about ourselves in whom we are and what we are doing that make us think and see ourselves as good people. When we know the world works by seeing it for what it is. When we don't understand why others see things this way when they aren't like us that we need extra eyes above and below to see why they brought us to such places. When we need to see somethings but not other things when we spend our time trying to see some people brought to justice, when their hands have been busy to the things we don't see. When what we see we don't want to see when it's something we neglected and others take away from us. When we see the outcome of whom we are dealing with and see they are capable of ending it all for us when they see somethings and stop thinking about other things to see the light or darkness of their ways when they don't see themselves capable of evil. When we see we were mere pawns in someone's game to reach the end.",

I believe this criticism in immensely unfair; The purpose of a movie, and most certainly not this one, is not to be 'realistic'. The beauty of this movie is that through cinematography consisting of well placed and suspenseful music as well as a thread of a dark decrepit thread that runs throughout the movie takes the viewer to a place within themselves in which their deepest darkest desires and fears lie. It is because of this that the events that construct the storyline are acceptable; they are a grandiose display of the negative attributes that lie within all of humanity to some extent.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed most about the movie were the progression of the main characters Somerset and Mills and their arch throughout the story and their purpose in serving the plot itself. In the early scenes of the movie one can see the two detectives are starkly different; Somerset is inquisitive, calculating, and level headed while Mills is impulsive, aggressive, and proud. I believe these two characters serve to not only create conflict to make the storyline more complex, but also present a social commentary because despite the fact that they are so different, as a viewer one is able to relate to both. They represent the push and pull of those characteristics within humanity.\n\nOne should not even have to argue. Se7en is no doubt an incredible movie, full of allusions to the bible that aid in presenting a commentary on the society in which we live. The message of the movie is to convey the decay of morals in our society, which parallels the thread of decay in the film.",

            "content": "Se7en is a psychological thriller starring Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, which places Detectives Mills (Pitt) and Somerset (Freeman) chasing after a serial killer. Newly assigned to work homicide in this unidentified city, Mills becomes Somerset's partner only a week before Somerset is planning to retire. Somerset's upcoming retirement allows his character to arc from a disgruntled old cop who wants to finish his duties to one who is eventually truly fascinated by the serial killer's use of classic literature and elaborate illustrations of the seven deadly sins. The cinematography and lighting in the film are common threads that allude to the sad world that we live in. There is always dim lighting and constant rain and poverty are shown throughout the city. This film provides moral commentary centered around the seven deadly sins and is constant throughout. Detective Mill's wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) plays what appears to be a minor role but her character development throughout the film is an interesting foreshadowing for what is an incredibly exciting ending. While the film may be a little slow at times, it certainly fits the psychological thriller genre and keeps the viewer from being prepared for obvious outcomes. The film's ending has a vague resolution, which differs from typical thrillers where the archetypical hero comes out clean in the end. Early on, it becomes obvious that there will be seven murders based on the seven deadly sins but the conflict has its fair share of twists and turns as Detectives Mills and Somerset battle against themselves and a highly educated serial killer who is meticulous beyond belief. This film gets a 3.5 / 5 rating, where the focus is on the incredible visuals and cinematography portrayed throughout.",

Each of this killer's victims represents one of seven deadly sins. The two detectives are on a clock to find the murderer before he kills all seven victims. It is a conflicting movie because there is so much to admire but the story itself is not what I want in a movie like this. Strong acting, storytelling and rich details take this to the point where it could be great. This movie deserves credit for pushing the grisly visuals to an extreme so that they resonate and disturb the viewer, as much as a murder scene should. David Fincher is a director who knows how to use darkness, shadows, and sound to build tension; his movies often dwell on dark stories. This movie has an aged feeling to it with washed-out gold tones, shallows that focus the attention on the characters or the subject in the foreground. Fincher forces you to read the facial expressions of the detectives in a highly effective way. At the same time, he also shoves the murder scenes in your face to achieve a repulsive visceral reaction. It does not show the violent actions, but the evidence left behind is truly terrifying. The murder and his psychosis are conceptually fascinating for a murder mystery. It moves in unexpected directions, builds an interesting sub-plot between the partners and shows intelligence and craft in the story. A nagging problem is hard to overcome is the resolution. The mystery, suspense and story all build to an exciting climax, but what happens is unfulfilling, and even unsettling. The direction is excellent and the acting performances are commendable, but when the story does not sit well it is hard to fully praise it. If dark subject matter compels you, and you appreciate an unpredictable yet unorthodox finish, then this could be a bulls-eye.",

This pair is assigned a case about a murder who executes people according to the seven deadly sins, so Mills and Somerset start a race against time to find the murderer before he finishes his seventh part masterpiece. \n\nMystery films centered on serial killers are nothing new and most of them are quite generic and forgettable, but that rule doesn't apply to Fincher\u00b4s breakthrough film. \"Seven\" counts with solid performance (as expected form perfectionist David Fincher), flawed characters that may lack depth but they are still interesting, a masterfully crafted gritty and disturbing atmosphere that provides a feeling of hopelessness, the visuals are shocking and unforgettable (some people may find them disturbing), the editing is kinetic and extremely effective in adding a feeling of desperation (starting from that beautifully creepy title sequence), a well written script that know how to keep the audience at the edge pf their seat, the ending is one of the most shocking and macabre I\u00b4ve ever seen (that ending is so powerful that it has being spoiled at the same level of some iconic scenes like the shower scene in \"Psycho\" or the prom scene in \"Carrie\", just to name some examples), Fincher\u00b4s perfectionist directing manages to craft a quite dark tone and holds it up until the last second of the film and his attention to details adds more power to the investigation, the villain is one of the most haunting in recent memory, a limited but striking and smart use of gore, smart storytelling that knows how to proportion or withheld information to the audiences, cinematography that manages to achieve a lot from a limited lighting and color palette, and overall is an intense experience. But regardless of all those fantastic elements, the biggest issue this film has is pacing as it drags at certain scenes and rushes at others. \n\n\"Seven\" is the darkest film of Fincher\u00b4s resume but it is one of his best as it is shocking, memorable, intense and masterfully crafted. Filled with unforgettable scenes and solid performances, this is one of the best murder mysteries you can find.",

The two detectives on the case have determined him to be thorough and methodical. The killer becomes aware of the detectives through their investigations, and then even appears to be leading the detectives to make discoveries about what he has done. Near the middle he has left clues that leads the detectives to a building where one if his victims is. The detectives find the victim. As they are leaving, a photographer leaps out and snaps a photo of one of the detectives before he is angrily chased off. As few people aside from the detectives knew of the victim's location, my immediate thought was, \"That was likely the killer.\" This was proved correct, as a few scenes later the detectives find the exact photo taken of one of them, in the killer's apartment. The detective in the photo has a wife, and we the audience have previously seen how distressed she is having newly moved to this violent city, and that she has also just become pregnant. My thought was, given how methodical the killer is, he does nothing without a purpose. He has deliberately taken a photo of one of the detectives. Why? You would have to assume the killer is then attempting to find out information about that detective - and as a consequence that detective and his family are potentially at great risk. \"He'll probably try and kill the detective's wife in the end,\" is what I said at that point. This possibility however didn't at all occur to the two supposedly highly experienced detectives in the movie. When the end happened involving the predicted outcome, I groaned.

At heart it's a gimmicky thriller with a screenplay that a bit better than the average trashy example of the genre, but doesn't do much that's special with it's stock characters and implausible plot twists.

As a result, it'll grip you whilst you're there, but it wont have a hugely lasting effect. \nVERDICT: One of the most gripping and exciting thrillers you'll watch in the moment, this is the perfect match between cop action and tense thriller.

It stars Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in a dark mystery film about a detective that's about to retire, and he has to do one more case, which is the seven deadly sins murders, and he gets a new partner who is short tempered, but wants to save people. I first got introduced to David Fincher's work with The Social Network because of its high reviews. Since I love that film, I started with the film that made him famous, and that is Seven, which was actually the second film that I watched from him, and it's still a fantastic and dark film. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt give out amazing performances, and so does Kevin Spacey, which I was surprised that the movie left out his name on the opening credits until the very end, making the film even more unpredictable of who he play as. I was trying to see the comparisons between this and Saw, and while there are some similar parts in it in terms of the detectives looking for the criminal masterminds, there's really not much of it and they both feel like separate films. I know I go on and on about the direction by David Fincher, but I just can't help it, it's really great here too because he really knows about how to make a great film and would do what it takes for his vision to come true. I do like that it doesn't feel like an episode of a cop show as this is darker and more twisted that way. I also like that this isn't a buddy cop film as the main characters are there to do their jobs, and they have different opinions on it that make them think on ways that the opposing detective would either think that way, or would not care. The writing by Andrew Kevin Walker is really good as it's interesting to hear the dialogue of the detectives' conversations, and the psyche of the villain of how this person starts it all. The opening credits of this film is really chilling to watch with a very creepy score by Howard Shore, and it's surprising that he's not well known for thriller/horror film scores as he's just known for the Lord of the Rings. Everybody knows about the ending here, which I still think is a haunting one that can really mess anyone up, and I find it very interesting on the fact that David Fincher and Brad Pitt really wanted that ending to stay in the film, and would not come back to the production if the ending doesn't go to the film. There are some funny moments that makes us not entirely miserable, especially the dinner scene with the train just going by pass, it was funny and relaxing to watch as the film did a good job of showing that there are some happy moments in the dark city. David Fincher's Seven is just as well made and well shotted as all of his films, and this is my favorite detective film.",

            "content": "Let me set the scene.  Halloween night 2015; trick-or-treaters gone and my parents retired to sleep... Its cold and the darkest shade of black outside...   I pop some popcorn and grab my blanket from my bedroom in the back of the house. I head into the living room and put my BLU-RAY copy of Seven into the player.  I turn on my father's 65 inch widescreen television (He got it on sale at the Black Friday the year previous to this one)  and turn on the sound bar connected to the television. I sit back on the sofa and press play on the film ready for my Halloween finale. \n\n I think David Fincher is a very talented director. I have enjoyed almost every film he has made (that I have seen).  I thought The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was excellent and I voiced a similar opinion of Gone Girl and Panic Room.   I didn't care for Zodiac but that wasn't because of Fincher in particular. After viewing Seven, I feel it renews my faith in David Fincher as a great director. Seven is smart and equally spooky and its script packs quite a punch (its twisted ending most of all). \n\n Seven is the story of two police detectives, a freshie (Brad Pitt) and a soon to be retiree (Morgan Freeman) who are on the trail of a serial killer who bases his murders off the seven deadly sins.  \n\n Each scene pulls you deeper into the mystery as we follow two developed and likable characters down a road of gruesome murder scenes and vague clues. I liked how Fincher portrayed the murder scenes and the lighting during these scenes. \n\n David Fincher directs excellent performances from Morgan Freeman to Brad Pitt to Gwyneth Paltrow to R. Lee Ermey to Kevin Spacey in a small but crucial role late in the film.  Pitt and Freeman and Spacey were excellent in their roles and I feel that Spacey's character could've have had a better actor.  Freeman seems to add something to this particular performance (something you can tell when watching him speak with Gwyneth Paltrow's character in a particular scene set in a diner) . Pitt demonstrates his acting chops during the ending and it's this one scene in particular hat made me conclude that Pitt had an award worthy performance on display.  \n\n I found the script to be sharply written, well paced and full of thrills and chills and character development. You know a script is well written when it ties all the plot points together into a twisted finale.  You know a script is sharply written when you can understand and hate a villain with only a handful of scenes. You know a script is sharply written if it is original and smart and filled with good dialogue and that's what the script for Seven is.  The final line in the film is the best as it summarizes the story's message \"'The world is a fine place, and worth fighting for'...I agree with the second part.\". That's what sharp writing is. \n\n I think that Gwyneth Paltrow was sidelined too much in the film (as she is in most films). I feel that if Fincher wanted to, he could've cut her almost completely out of the film and it wouldn't have made much of a difference except in the conclusion of the film.  \n\n This is a dark, thrilling and well made film by David Fincher featuring appealing performances from Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.

            "content": "The rain never stops, color never bears a warmth, murders seem endless, and humanity is left floating.  If \"Se7en\" doesn't depict a hell on Earth then I don't know what does.  Cold and dark, it is the kind of film you appreciate for its down-trodden intelligence, its elusive whodunit stylings - but you are left gazing at it from afar like an art museum piece.  To get too close might change you in ways to haunting to admit.  It is more about the horrific evils the human race is capable of than it is about its focal mystery, and such meditations keep it from doing anything other than disturbing.  The film is relentlessly gloomy.\n\tI think it has stuck with audiences for so long because it so emotionally sadistic.  No other mainstream thriller has ever gone as far as \"Se7en\" has, and I don't think another one ever will.  Before it was even made, executives wanted it to be more action-based, less grisly - the version seen on screen is a rough draft accidentally sent to the then-rising David Fincher (\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" \"Gone Girl\"), who was intrigued by what he read and fought (successfully) to get the darker version in theaters.  Unless you count \"Alien 3,\" his first foray into cinema that he himself has admitted to disliking, \"Se7en\" is among the most callous debuts in film history.  It sets the tone for his remarkable career, which has, more than once, pondered how gritty realism can meet (and clash) with commercial entertainment values (though I'm sure he'll never be able to match the barbarousness of \"Se7en\" quite so ferociously ever again).\n\tBrad Pitt nor Morgan Freeman have ever been met with such dark material either.  In the film, Pitt is David Mills, an upstart, young detective who flirts with anger management and who flirts with brilliance.  Freeman is Det. William Somerset, a grizzled old pro only days away from much needed retirement.  Mills has just moved with his pretty wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), in order to bask in frequently rewarding cases located in the bad part of town the film notably takes place in.  Somerset, with his seen-it-all cynicism, wants nothing more than to get away from the bleakness that so constantly surrounds him.\n\tBut then a case lands in their laps too horrific to ignore - a serial killer, emotionless and nefarious, is murdering innocent individuals in a way that pits their deaths against the Seven Deadly Sins.  For Gluttony, he forces an obese man to eat until his stomach bursts, for example.  Mills is excited by the case and the fame that could occur following its solving, but Somerset, wanting to leave his job on a good note, begs his superior to let someone else handle the investigation.  Neither, however, realize just how personal the case will soon become.\n\t\"Se7en\" begins as an unusually astute police procedural involving in all the right ways, from the way we become fiendishly curious as to how the killer will strike next to the emotional connection we feel for its leading characters, all flawlessly portrayed by Pitt, Freeman, and Paltrow.  But as the film snakes along do we begin to notice that, even once the case is solved, such fearful crimes will only continue in this land where the sun doesn't shine; who knows how long it will be before another obsessive murderer wreaks havoc upon the community? \n\tThe contrast between the characters of Mills and Somerset is dynamic.  Mills purposely got himself transferred to Somerset's district in search of more adrenaline in his work, as if to be completely unaware that more crime means more hellaciousness - even one's personal life could be changed by such tawdriness.  Somerset has experienced every case imaginable, and, despite warning Mills that taking on the investigation will not end happily, his counterpart is too dangerously compelled (as we are) to realize that getting as far as possible from the situation is the better route to take.  They don't like each other in the way friends do - we can see that Somerset views Mills as a sort of son, protective of his vocational innocence and worried about how his marriage will be affected through living in this dangerous, noiry part of the city.  \n\tThe killer, who I will not mention the name of in order to retain the secrecy of his identity kept upon \"Se7en\"'s release, is portrayed with methodical cool reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter.  Though we know that they are insane, that bloodlust is not a natural human genetic, their intelligence causes us to believe that they are still somehow superior to us, somehow more perceptive of the world, even if this standpoint is, in truth, false.  He is not revealed until the very last act of the film, but his capture is a part of his plan.  Some argue that Lecter is a screen villain villainous to enough to fill the blank spaces of other serial killer films, the evilest of the evil, but \"Se7en\"'s madman seems to be just a little more in love with being cruel - he finds joy in the destruction of another person's life, and that makes him absolutely terrifying.  \n\tI will warn, though, that you will be more repulsed by \"Se7en\" than you will be bewitched by it like \"The Silence of the Lambs.\" The latter does not surround graphic crime scenes with the brutal fashion like \"Se7en\" does, being more about the magnetism of the investigation than anything.  And it shows off a relatively happy ending, with Jodie Foster being a heroine for the ages.  But \"Se7en\" is blood-soaked at nearly every corner; when it isn't, it is deeply melancholy, in a way that suggests nothing will ever get better.  I could never become emotionally involved with it (aside from its characters) - it is too icy to experience on a humane level - but that doesn't stop me from praising how it doesn't conform to mainstream cinema fakery.  In a world this black, there shouldn't be a happy ending.",

Freeman is amazing as always, and Pitt is oscar worthy, gwenyth Paltrow is good but has limited screen time which was good (I cannot stand her), and Kevin Spacey is brilliant as this paychopath. the way he explains why he does these things makes you think what he does is justified.

Freeman and Pitt's polar opposite character chemistry works together very well, as well as a top notch performance by Spacey, convincingly demented in each cryptic word he utters in the ending. Freeman is once again amazing in his performance. The film is a bit slow in its beginning but picks up majorly over time.

It's not real deep, just the story of two detectives trying to solve some crimes. But for me, it's one of those movies I wished I hadn't watched.",

Fincher created a movie that not only produced scares, but also made you tense in the aftermath, thinking that you looked into the abyss.",

            "content": "If nothing else, I feel like everyone has to admit that Se7en has a perfect script. It is brilliantly structured to take you on the same journey with the detectives, always one step behind what John Doe will do next. And, as long as we're admitting the obvious, we also have to talk about David Fincher's amazing direction. The dark look of the film perfectly matches the tone, the shot selection always seems to be spot-on, and he deserves all the praise in the world for fighting the studio to keep the ending as written. While I will avoid spoiling that ending on the off chance someone hasn't seen it, it is a true masterpiece that adds so much weight to the film. I was absolutely stunned the first time I watched Se7en and sat silently in my seat for more than 10 minutes after it ended in total shock. This is a film that people will still be talking about 50 years from now, and it will be spoken of as a classic of our generation. There are few movies like this that can suck me in from the first frame of the film and hold my attention completely for more than 2 hours, even though I already know what's going to happen. There's not a lot of action, but the story is so engaging and every scene is important either for progressing the plot or reinforcing the themes.\n\nBrad Pitt is great as the young detective who is new to town. He has an ego which fits someone who has risen so high already at his age but he also provides most of the, admittedly rare, laughs in the film. Morgan Freeman is the only man I can picture in the role of Somerset. He is totally in his element as he portrays the hyper-intelligent, but frustrated old veteran. He has a tendency to be friendly but also a bit reserved because the city has jaded him so much. Naturally, a film about a serial killer is pretty dark and intense stuff. There's a decent amount of gore and disturbing material that will not sit well with some viewers. While I don't know if it's really a criticism, there are people who will be disgusted by Se7en, so it doesn't have that kind of mass appeal that other masterpieces of cinema have. Even I can't bear to watch it all that often because it's a heavy film, not one you can just throw on and munch on popcorn. Yet I think the mastery of this film is in the restraint that Fincher shows. Many of the most gruesome and awful things in this film are only described rather than seen. However, the details are so specific that our minds fill in the blanks to the point where people who have seen the film will often swear they saw something that was never actually shown on camera. And for those moments when we do see some detail of the murders it is necessary in order to tell the tale and to help us understand the insane passion of John Doe. There are very few movies with a climax as tough to take as Se7en. It almost forces you as a viewer to go through the same thought process as the main characters and wonder what the right thing is to do at that point, and whether we WANT them to do the right thing. As you can see Se7en is a film I could spend hours praising and going into every detail about its genius. If you haven't seen it and you think you can take it, then it would be a sin if you didn't check it out sometime.",

While Moran Freeman delivers a great performance, he is at a tremendous disadvantage with the lines given him. Unfortunately Brad Pitt and other fall prey to the sophomoric script in which most characters are attempting to say something big instead resort to a hollow line or in Pitt's case \"shut up.\" His performance is childish, constantly flailing his arms about and getting all worked up. It just goes to show how much he's matured as an actor.",

The ending of this movie was a bit bitter but like Freeman says in the movie \"this isn't going to end well\" and it really shows that it didn't end up well for them. The acting in this movie was great, the two leads had great chemistry and really showed off their acting skills. Brad Pitt at the last scene of the movie especially, he was great! Now about the disturbing portion of the movie... This film had a lot of disturbing moments in terms of the kills by the killer. I mean some people will get light headed at parts. I love how it's like that! If you are able to make something that disturbing look so realistic you did something right there! Hats off to the crew. The movie had really good opening and ending credits to keep me interested in well, credits(Trent Reznor is always good). The movie is very well directed, well acted, VERY realistic and really suspenseful. Se7en is one of the creepiest, disturbing and suspenseful movies I've ever seen and I applaud it for fulfilling all those categories at once. B+",

            "content": "There are few films which can lay claim to scenes which shook the world, or at least the people watching. Alien had the Chestburster, Silence of the Lambs had that first meeting with Hannibal Lecter, Se7en has the box. A simple cardboard box that gives way to an ending which literally rivals the best cinema has to offer.\u00a0\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. Se7en follows detectives Mills and Somerset as they try to track down a serial killer whose pattern is that of the seven deadly sins.\u00a0\n\nDavid Fincher has been lauded as some sort of a technical genius recently, especially with his incredible work in the Social Network, but at the time of making Se7en, his reputation was somewhat different. After a long line of music videos, Fincher finally made the move in the movie world with the disappointing Alien 3. Basically, it was time to prove himself. All it takes is the opening credits sequence to do so. Set to a Nine Inch Nails remix, the credits themselves set the mood and tone for the rest of the film brilliantly. From then on, Fincher creates a Blade Runner-esque noir feel to a crumbling city which, lacking a physical evildoer, becomes the villain against Mills and Somerset's dual protagonists. Fincher, whilst living in his previous movies' shadow, isn't afraid to make some bold choices in terms of shooting, working with some disorientating handheld shots to great effect and beautifully obscuring his villain until the reveal. He may not have been the virtuoso that he is now but it's an incredible starting point. Despite the urge to occasionally close-in on a gory set-piece, Fincher restrains from gratuity in many cases, preferring to let our minds do the work that the production team doesn't. The fact that we don't actually see any of the killings is tribute to this fact, but what Fincher shows us in the aftermath is more shocking than any amount of violence alone could do. Fincher also makes sure to focus on the relationships of the piece. The ending being the way it is, it wouldn't work if the emotional connection to the viewer hadn't been set up in the first place. Fincher does this with incredible precision without sacrificing his films grimy tone. It truly is a masterful piece of directing which only began to show his potential for films to come.\u00a0\n\nAndrew Kevin Walker's script is at once sympathetic and diabolical, especially in the way that it knowingly sets the viewer up to be crushed towards the end. The book which the film is based on may be the starting point for this, but Walker's incredible depth of emotion and knack for realistic dialogue means that this is achieved with that much more impact. The dialogue between Mills and Somerset is beautifully written, achieving a realistic relationship between the two without rushing it along. The natural evolution of a working relationship to start with, then to a true friendship is a brilliant achievement by Walker. It would be easy to shoehorn these two characters into something easily recognisable and clich\u00e9d for the sake of time, but it's much more rewarding to see it play out the way it does. The two character Walker brings to life are intricately layered and filled with nuance, even while still on the page.\u00a0\n\nBut the two characters would stay there if it wasn't for Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman's incredible portrayal of the two. Pitt plays Mills, the new guy in town, who is enthusiastic to the point of impatience and who doesn't quite know how to act around people. Despite his initial abrasiveness, Pitt imbues him with such a goofy charm that, even when he's busy tripping over his tongue, he is incredibly likeable. The stark contrast between his demeanour at the office and his attitude at home is played with clever subtlety by Pitt creating a more rounded character than that of your typical buddy-cop movie. His interaction with Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic as well, being careful to play down the obvious love that he holds for her which makes their relationship seem all the more real. Paltrow's performance here is similarly fantastic, a symbol of hope for most of the characters in the film. Her conversation with Somerset is as emotional as it should be without being a drama and her connection with Mills is that of a young, but clearly in love, couple. Morgan Freeman's performance is amazing as always, but here his godlike unshakable attitude pays off better than other times. His subtle shift towards uncertainty and finally terror is an incredible thing to watch as we see his vainly trying to grasp at the last vestiges of control that he has over his circumstances. It's truly an amazing performance but, then again, it's Morgan Freeman. It's difficult to imagine him turning in anything else. Kevin Spacey, though he's only in the film for a short amount of time, makes an indelible impression on the film. His ranting, just short of manic, performance shows off exactly what Spacey has become famous for; his chameleon-like ability to become any role. Though my favourite performance of his has to be Lester Burnham, this would definitely be a close second next to Verbal Kint. His cold, detached stare which occasionally gives way to furious, operatic speeches is an amazing thing to watch. Richard Schiff, a vastly underrated performer, snatches a few minutes of screen time and turns in a brilliantly murky performance. His smug attitude and impenetrable demeanour make him hypnotic to watch. It's sad he doesn't get to be onscreen for longer. John C. Reilly also makes an appearance in the film, miles away from his jovial Dr. Cox and more towards his character in Platoon without all the cowardice. Bit-parts such as the surviving victim of lust also make for incredible performances but it's these central ones which stick in the mind the longest.\u00a0\n\nSe7en is a testament and origin point for David Fincher's prowess as a filmmaker, a film noir worthy to be mentioned with the likes of Blade Runner and a horror to stand the test of time. Not for the faint hearted.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nDespite the sheer shock factor of the Sloth scene, the defining scene has to be that earth-shaking ending.",

            "content": "I apologise for any faults in my writing. Writing quick and without precision tonight.\n\nSeven is a dark film. Composed with admirable technique on a technical front, and utterly shocking and brutal on a storytelling basis. Director David Fincher's second major feature film is considered his most grim, gruesome and demented, and after viewing it for the first time, I can do little but nod my head in agreement. Centring around a pair of detectives, one of them a loud, naive and boisterous individual who also happens to be relatively trigger happy and buys into the conventional hero type, and his partner being a secluded, hidden and emotionally cloaked man who understands the true pain and frustration associated with his undesirable occupation. The film follows them as they try to track down a killer who utilizes the seven deadly sins to execute innocent victims; he is a man who lacks visual empathy or sympathy, and respects those who track him correctly. We watch as the two detectives pull themselves apart emotionally, looking for the man who tests the boundaries of moral and societal acceptance and ambiguity, and threatens their own very sanity. Seven is a sick, twisted horrifying picture, that whilst not always compelling, demands utter attention.\n\nWe start with a grizzly death. A fat man, head laying within a dish of pasta. It's raining outside. Obviously, we aren't there, but we feel the cold seeping through into the dark room that we're confronted with. Fincher's cinematographer and gaffer, Darius Khondji and Chris Strong respectively, immediately set the tone of the film; the negatives are cold and edgy, and the lights that shine through holes and windows are slight, providing atmosphere instead of any relief. It's raining outside, which happens to be perhaps one of my favourite things about the opening scenes in this film. Seven starts slowly, and this is undeniably the least applaudable section of the running time. The characters are initially not as compelling as one would desire, and whilst the camera work captures the dark and twisted feeling of the rest of the movie, we aren't yet caught up in Fincher's story. As Brad Pitt's character, the younger detective named Mills, is introduced, I was not initially impressed with the actors performance. It was crude and reflective of the time period and the characters personality, but the delivery felt weak, not fully invested. Perhaps this was the intention of Pitt or Fincher? Nevertheless, it isn't worthy of commendation from my point of view.\n\nWe're introduced to the case and the characters and all those involved, but we don't really care. Neither Mills nor Freeman's character, Somerset, are particularly interesting. Do not fear; this will change down to the track. For the time being though, we aren't fully invested in what's going on. Fincher is introducing us to the look of the picture, and he, along with screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker seem to forget to provide us with enthralling material. This is the first fifteen minutes. We see another murder, and we're introduced to the gimmick behind the picture; the killer is utilizing the seven deadly sins. I, unlike many, do not care if a film is based around a gimmick, so long as the characters are provided with interesting back stories and meaning. At this point, I'm not invested in anyone or anything in particular, so I'm irritated with where the film is heading. And then suddenly, almost without warning, the film seems to explode with vitality, energy sprouting as the case and the performances and the writing and everything all seeming to quicken up, the story becoming instantaneously more interesting. Somerset finds a clue from the second murder scene, and suddenly we get backstory into his personality and life. We get information on Mills, his child-like ways, as well as his beautiful wife, named Tracy and played by the dreaded Gwyneth Paltrow. Suddenly, the gimmick is only part of the picture, not the entirety of it.\n\nThe characters hurdle through the plot, and we witness the tedious life of a detective, which involves writing, taking calls, thinking. But the film never feels slow or held down by this: we're provided with hunks of tension, so much that I was on the edge of my seat half the running time, even if there really wasn't anything going on. Fincher's minimalist cinematography combined with the gloomy atmosphere help to build up a sense of dread within the viewer. We understand that something just has to happen. Someone is going to die, or they're going to stumble onto something they shouldn't. Mills and Somerset rush to stop the killer, but they have to deal with their own differing opinions in regards to what being a detective means. They debate on their styles, which include Mills kicking down doors and intruding upon privately-owned space, and Somerset understanding the slow and tedious life they life in reality. The film is never bogged down by these portions; in fact, they are part of the most entertaining portions. As the film rushes to its climax, these characters become the focal point, as does the killer, and we reflect on their development and being.\n\nAnd then the climax happens.\n\nAnd whereas Seven was vying for an acceptable rating prior to this point, it not only exceeds my expectations, but proves to be one of the most shocking and frightening finales I've ever had the grace of viewing. The development and dialogue on the meaning of human innocence, moral impurity and misunderstanding finally give way to the shocking ending, which delivers gut punches to the viewer left, right and centre. Andrew Kevin Walker; stand up and take a bow. There are great final acts, and then there is the final act of Jaws, and then there is the final act of How To Train Your Dragon. And then there is the final act of Seven. It's unpredictable and beautifully filmed; the finale is the only portion of the picture filmed with sun and clarity. The murky and unsettling story of the rest of the film gives way to pitch-perfect comprehensibility. Both visually and in terms of storytelling, Seven finally proves why it is beloved by nearly all who view it, thanks to this conclusion which rattles the viewer to the core.\n\nSo perhaps it's not perfect. The characters aren't initially all that interesting, and the movie doesn't start shocking until at least fifteen minutes into its running time. But after that, Fincher doesn't just pick up the pace; he starts sprinting. Never is there a dull moment. The picture tricks you into thinking every minute or sequence is important, and we thank it for it. A film which can entertain without missing a beat is always appreciated, and Seven does exactly that. Pitt and Freeman, after their preliminary scenes, prove to deliver two of the performances of their careers. Fincher's glum direction and pacing leaves the viewer with little time to feel bored or lacking tension, and we soak it in and appreciate it. Cinematographer Darius Khondji's work is beautiful, cleanly cut and always precise. He provides the usual Fincher look; as if we're viewing this picture from afar, witnessing the events from the side. The lighting technicians and the aforementioned gaffer, Chris Strong, provide an atmosphere that the film often relies on, and it benefits from immensely. Even Howard Shore's score is effective, and I often criticise the atrocious musical taste that David Fincher has! Shore actual understands musical coherence, instead of the crap that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross pump out. I've only seen 3 David Fincher films, and this one fares in the middle: The Social Network I gave an 8.8, Gone Girl I awarded 9.8, and Seven I award a 9.2. This is a competent, harrowing, somewhat uneven but undeniably powerful suspense thriller that doesn't let go until the very last second.\n\n\"Ernest Hemingway once wrote, \"The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.\" I agree with the second part.\"",

I can tell he's seen Silence of the Lambs. Before watching I refused to read any reviews of this film. I didn't check Rotten Tomatoes, I just sat down and watched it. I was thoroughly impressed. It's directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and Gwyneth Paltrow. \n\nWilliam Somerset (Freeman) has just been given a new case. A corpulent man died after bring forced to gorge bowl after bowl of spaghetti. As he and newcomer David Mills (Pitt) investigate, they soon discover it's the work of a somewhat religious serial killer. His killings are inspired by the seven deadly sins. Each kill is against a particular person with a particular sin. As they go deeper and deeper, discovering each new victim, they realize this is nothing they've ever seen before. When they finally confront the mysterious John Doe, he turns the tables. He is in complete control. \n\nBrad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are the perfect team in this film. The two of them have great chemistry on screen. Pitt does a really solid job, and gives possibly the best performance of the film. Freeman is cool and slick as always. He definitely has that aging cop vibe. Kevin Spacey, while not in the film much, gives quite a chilling and disturbing performance. \n\nThe direction from David Fincher is really impressive. This guy knows how to direct a crime thriller. The scenes of the film flow perfectly together all the way to the end. The writing and dialogue in this film are also very impressive. Each word spoken feels like it should be there. The cinematography by Darius Khondji is impressive, and the score by Howard Shore is haunting. A book was later written based on the film, which even led to a few comic book adaptations. \n\nThis film is very disturbing. It reminds me very much of Silence of the Lambs. While not a masterpiece like that film, it is still fantastic. Every scene builds the tension of the film. As they uncover each death, you feel a sense of utter horror. It makes ones stomach twist and turn within. When the killer is revealed, it's extremely shocking. Kevin Spacey does a great job at making you feel sick to your stomach.\n\n\"Se7en'' is a masterfully directed film with fantastic performances. It's a must if you are a fan of crime thrillers with a tenge of horror. It's well written, smart, disturbing, full of tension, and has a finale that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I will definitely be watching more Fincher films after this.",

Though as we go along; this haunting and freighting film turns out to be a psychological thriller between the killer and the two detectives (played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt). The ending is what really is messed up and great. I'm not going to ruin it but **Kevin Spacey** is fantastic as the villain. Scenes of him and Pitt are fantastic. Critic \"Jami Bernard\" should never be taken seriously with this line \"and certainly none of the psychology\". What movie was this guy watching? If you watch the ending to this movie; you can't tell me that it doesn't have psychology themes, theories, ideas, etc. Fincher doesn't hold up on the ending. As he's well known for endings that you'll love to kind of hate, but still love...if that makes sense. This ending is no exception. Overall this is his best work. Gone Girl was great but this was fantastic and maybe one of the best movies of all time. 9.7",

            "content": "A gritty, wet and filthy neo-noir of the late 20th century, Se7en remains as both a quintessential crime noir tale, and one of David Fincher's defining work as a director. Se7en is ultimately as an intricately crafted film that uses the horror of humanity as a commentary into the two opposing sides of it, constantly engaged in a struggle for dominance over the other. Se7en focuses on a theme of a persisting and omnipresent evil, and it doesn't shy away from constantly reminding the audience of it through David Fincher's stellar direction, which ultimately breathed life into visualizing Andrew Walker's script.\n\nThe events in Se7en are constantly draped with a depressing, ominous feeling, and you can't help feel nothing but dread throughout the whole film. Crimes are shown in passing glimpses, under the cover of heavy downpour. Characters speak of vile acts they've seen or experienced in the city. A city which has no name or identifiable identity. One whose ambiguity could mean that it could very well be any city in America, and even extends out to any other city in the world.\n\nThen there are the downright brutal, calculative murders that Detective Mills and Somerset are tasked with solving. Can anyone ever forget the Sloth murder? The first few murders are a play on the audience's visual senses, and then it evolves into a play on the audience's imagination. Murders aren't shown, but teased in controlled portions of the screen, through pictures of the 'tools' used and through the narration of characters, be it overtly or subtly, using the imagination of the viewer against them.\n\nDetective William Somerset, originally written with John Hurt in mind, is played excellently by Morgan Freeman, who utilizes his iconic warm, yet authoritative voice to the best of his capabilities as the grizzled, veteran detective who has to ease his replacement, Detective David Mills, into his position. Brad Pitt himself plays Mills amazingly as a fast-talking, witty young hotshot detective, and both Freeman and Pitt have that natural chemistry, as the actors play off their actual difference in age and talent - one is a young hotshot actor, and the other is a veteran, experienced actor - to their advantage when portraying their characters.\n\nWhile this isn't exactly something new, back then or even now, to have cops with different views, principles or approach to their jobs to become partners, and then have a film based around it, Se7en is the only serious film that this particular premise has truly worked in for me.The killer, a literal and figurative John Doe, is both fleshed out, and paradoxically, not fleshed out.\n\nTowards the end, Mills and Somerset finally learn about this monstrosity that they've been chasing, and everything is presented in fractured pieces that certain parts of the audience might piece together, or might consider a disjointed mess. It is at this point, that the audience either becomes Detective Mills or Detective Somerset; one plays off the killer as a simple, downright lunatic, while the other sees the bigger picture of this particular brand of lunacy, and prods and questions it further.",

Its hard to disagree, I have previously expressed my love for Alien 3 and seen what could have been with a flawed film, however this was down to very little fault on Fincher's part, in fact he had little to no creative control by the end of that movie. So saying this is his definitive debut may not be accurate but it definatly sets the tone and ball rolling for what would be an impressive and close to flawless career. After moving to the worst place in America, with his wife, Detective Mills joins up with Detective Somerset, who is spending his final week on the force. This uneven partnership stumble upon what happens to be a string of related murders, that follow the pattern of the 7 deadly sins. Wills and Somerset find themselves racing against the clock in order to find the killer before they find his next victim. This films premise may sound old and done to death by todays standards and you would be right by thinking that. However this screenplay is so intelligently written, so captivating to watch and so expertly put together that its not until the end credits, where you reflect upon what has just happened, that you truly admire its greatness. The cast are brilliant, heading up this game of cat and mouse are Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, R. L. Emroy and Gwyneth Platrow. Everyone here is on their A game, Freeman does brilliantly as the soon to retire cop, showing hatred for a wreck of a city and contempt for its population. Emroy knocks the detective role straight on the head and Paltrow plays it straight with a very likable and loving character. Pitt funnily enough is the weakest link here, thats not to say he is bad, not at all, hes great in fact. It's just that at some points his dialogue or delivery can be a bit hammy. However that doesnt take away from the dark and deep subject matter, each death scene is more grotesque than the next, with killer John Doe, methodically taking his time to commit the perfect and eye opening crime. This film is wonderfully shot, Darius Khonji and Fincher get the camera in some awkward and bizarre places, giving you everything you need visually from a scene. Whether its a tracking shot following Mills feat as he closes in on a preying killer or the slick steadi-cam shots the litter throughout. The lighting and rain really ramp up an atmosphere in this film. It literally rains for the entire first 3 quarters of the film and it just adds so much life to the piece. It's funny to look back at Seven now, from what once was a master piece to something overshadowed by a better career. For a second film this is unbelievable and truly worthy on anyone's collection. However the odd awkward delivery of dialogue or the slightly over used formula may wear the sense of a unique vibe about the film, it still holds up today and a well rounded, thought provoking and chilling piece of cinema. If you havent seen this film, dont read too deeply into it, dont look at artwork, dont watch a trailer. Just go and pick it up for 3 pound and enjoy.",

            "content": "Story: Director David Fincher's dark, stylish thriller ranks as one of the decade's most influential box-office successes. Set in a hellish vision of a New York-like city, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt), the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. The moody photography is by Darius Khondji; the nauseatingly vivid special effects are by makeup artist Rob Bottin, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like The Howling (1981). \n\nThe Mood: is fantastic very Dark and creepy in this fictional city that is never mentioned, but is terrible cause no one wants to live in this City. some of the scenes of the 7 deadly sins are just creepy like when it shows Sloth its disgusting and they didn't show Lust, but they said it would have been creepy as fuck\n\nThe Cast\n\nMorgan Freeman is fantastic as always just a guy who is close to retirement and just wants to leave this city cause he is sick of it and just wants to work on his farm.\n\nBrad Pitt is also great one of his great under rated performances as the young cop who for some reason wants to work in this city lol.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow  is good\n\nThe Killer is a surprise.\n\nthis Film looks beautiful  with its creepy tone and darkness to it Fincher is just a master of creepy movies very happy this one was amazing and no one compares this to his Alien 3 which he hates and regrets it.\n\nThe Ending is one of the greatest endings to a movie ever its so well done and fantastic and creepy that the Studio almost didn't want it to happened, but Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman said no they want this ending in the movie.\n\nOverall: I Love this movie its one of my favorite David Fincher Films with its mystery and creepy dark tone, with great performances and amazing ending\n\nOverall Grade: A+",

The internet is an unfair bitch If you haven't seen this film yet, so go watch it, and you will enjoy it more than I did.\nSe7en I'd like to say is Fincher's first film (You know, counting out that Awful alien \"thing\") and the story is pretty simple. Two detectives, Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) go over an investigation about a series of murders concerning a killer who is obssesed with the seven deadly sins. Somerset and Mills have to find this man before he completes his seven murders, which makes for an interesting if not familiar policial thriller premise. Let's face it, it is not original, but it is good.\nFincher is king when it comes to atmosphere, and in Se7en he proves it once more. The film has a dark, eerie tone but also the production design is excellent at putting us between the walls of some of the nastiest murders ever filmed. There are buckets of gore in this movie from beginning to end, but what really elevates this film to a dauntless status is its ending, which I'm not going to spoil, but is so disturbing and thought-provoking it leaves room for an even as enjoyable second viewing. Additionally, Se7en is solid at being riveting by having this \"list\" type of narration when it comes to the seven murders. It is engaging from start to finish.\nA perturbing, implausible thriller that is as alluring as off-putting, Se7en trades originality for panache and leaves with the big bucks.",

It has the typical rookie and veteran, which still works, and an enemy that we never get to see until the very end.  The murders are gruesome, like the ones in Saw but showing only the aftermath.  One man left for a year strapped in a bed, another forced to eat to death, and another forces to cut off a pound of his own flesh.  These games always result in death, and leave a sickening mess.  The seven sins is something I'm not familiar with, but makes a good story do matter how unprobable. Having a killer force people to suicide basically  claiming it's at the hand of God makes little sense, but with the right crazy person could happen I suppose. The ending is great, not what is entirely expected although there is some hints, and finishes the film in a good abrupt way.  Overall great movie, there is many great films about deceptive a out there, so I can't say where is one really stands, but it is up there for sure.",

            "content": "David Fincher's Seven is one of the most well made and well crafted mystery films of all time. This is a fantastically well made, dark and disturbing film that I just love. This film stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman and both of them are fantastic. Both of the characters are cliches but the brilliant thing is both Pitt and Freeman are so good that they make you forget they are playing cliches. Brad Pitt is great and his character could've been quite annoying but he's great and Pitt gets to really prove how great he is in the ending of this film. Morgan Freeman however steals the show and this is one of his best performances. His character is again a huge cliche but he's great and gives an Oscar worthy performance. Gwyneth Paltrow gives probably her best performance I've seen. This movie is also amazingly directed by David Fincher who keeps this film nail bitingly tense throughout and gives us possibly the best movie ending ever. The writing is also fantastic as this film just never lets up and is a very disturbing film. Seven is known as one of the most disturbing films ever and yeah it is but it was a great choice from Fincher to decide to only show the aftermath of the murders because if he had showed the murders this film just would have been too much. One of the most disturbing sections here is the Lust sequence; we don't see anything in this scene only the aftermath buts it's just so disturbing due to the suggestion and implication and a fantastic performance from Leland Orser. This film is extremely tense, especially the chase scene and the ending. Speaking of which Seven has one of the best endings ever. As in mentioned it's extremely tense and disturbing but it's also very emotional. Seven is a technical masterpiece with amazing cinematography and lighting which makes the city the film is set seem almost like a character. The way the city is presented is amazing and is an extremely gritty and harsh environment. Fincher also decided to never say where the film is set which makes this film even more disturbing as you feel like the film could happen anywhere. The editing is also great and this film is never boring. I don't really have any problems here this film is just that good. Seven is masterpiece of a film and one of Fincher's best along with Fight Club. This is a fantastic film. A+",
