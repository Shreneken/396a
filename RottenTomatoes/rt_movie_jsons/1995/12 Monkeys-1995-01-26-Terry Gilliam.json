    "summary": "Traveling back in time isn't simple, as James Cole (Bruce Willis) learns the hard way. Imprisoned in the 2030s, James is recruited for a mission that will send him back to the 1990s. Once there, he's supposed to gather information about a nascent plague that's about to exterminate the vast majority of the world's population. But, aside from the manic Jeffrey (Brad Pitt), he gets little in the way of cooperation, not least from medical gatekeepers like Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe).",

            "content": "This is a strange film but it has an interesting plot that keeps you invested despite the goofy characters and sub-par acting from some of the lesser known cast. Bruce Willis gives a good performance but it is Brad Pitt that steals every scene he is in. The film feels a little dated but the futuristic settings and technology look very good and still hold up well. The ending is predictable and you can see the twists coming if you pay enough attention. If you're into 90's films or time-travel concepts then you should enjoy this.",

I really liked the scenes with Cole and Goines in the mental hospital and how certain things connected in the plot sequences, however at a certain point the movie slowed down for me and got a little too distracted by the time traveling angle and Cole's romance with the psychiatrist. It seemed to be building up to something that ultimately wasn't worth the payoff with a kind of ambiguous ending.",

Perhaps I got my hopes up too high or was hoping for something this film wasn't interested in providing, but this movie was just so much dumber than I expected. Basically every character acts like a complete idiot so when it tried to get me to empathize and care for the character's emotional journey I just didn't have it in me because I found everything they did to be so annoyingly dumb. \n\nBruce Willis's character kept fluctuating between a somewhat normally intelligent guy and a complete caveman brain and his co-stars weren't much better. About halfway through I thought that this tone might've worked a lot better if this were a satire/comedy like Brazil but without any jokes or enough exaggeration in the world it didn't fit that either. \n\nI really was excited to watch this movie, and though I don't consider it bad per se, I am sadly quite disappointed after watching it.\n\nAlso it felt so predictable and rote that I successfully guessed the exact way it was going to end in the first minute.",

He was up on the sea of fates and had not entered the darkest phase of his career.\n\nExecutive producer Robert Kosberg was a fan of a French called La Jet\u00e9e\u00a0and convinced its director Chris Marker to let him try and get the movie made by Universal, who bought the rights and hired writers David and Janet Peoples. David was a writer on\u00a0Blade Runner,\u00a0Unforgiven,\u00a0Ladyhawke,\u00a0Soldier and wrote and directed\u00a0The Blood of Heroes. Janet wrote several documentaries before collaborating with her husband on this script.\n\nProducer Charles Roven felt that Gilliam was the perfect choice to direct this non-linear movie.\n\nA deadly virus was released in 1996 by the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and now the survivors live underground. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is one of those survivors, a prisoner due to his violent outbursts and emotions, who is selected to go back in time and warn others in the past. He's also suffering from dreams of a shooting in an airport.\n\nWhen he arrives in Baltimore, he's six years early and institutionalized, a prison all over again. Only Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and another patient, the anti-capitalist Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) listen to him. Cole tries to escape and ends up back in the future, where he's told that he must stop Goines, who seemingly is the one to unleash the virus. The time machine is faulty and sends him to World War I before its correct destination of 1996, a time when Railly is giving a speech about the Cassandra complex -- when a prophet warns others of danger and is not listened to -- and ends up meeting Dr. Peters (David Morse), who tells her that anyone who believes in the end of the world is sane and anyone who denies the ecological collapse of Earth is the one truly crazy.\n\nCole kidnaps Railly and they learn that Goines definitely is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, using the virus that his father Dr. Leland Goines (Christopher Plummer) invented and inspired from meeting Cole in 1990. Yet is that true? Is Cole insane? Is the time travel actually happening? And what really is his mission?\n\nGilliam himself said that \"The story is disconcerting. It deals with time, madness and a perception of what the world is or isn't. It is a study of madness and dreams, of death and re-birth, set in a world coming apart.\"\n\nAt one point, Cole goes from believer to unbeliever and Railly makes the opposite decision. In one of Marker's later films, Sans Soleil, a voiceover states \"only one film has been capable of portraying impossible memory, insane memory: Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo*.\" Cole and Railly watch this film within the movie -- Cole says, \"I think I've seen this movie before\" -- and we even hear the strings of Bernard Hermann's theme play.\n\nThis was probably a hard watch back in 1995 and today, it's really difficult. I mean, someone immolated themselves to draw attention to climate change yesterday. Wynn Bruce spent an entire year planning this action only for his death to be lost in the coverage of celebrity relationships.\n\nThe movie posits that 2035 is the darkest time of the future. Yet in 2030, if global emissions aren't halved, this world will be unlivable. But what can one person do -- like Cole, I feel I am not even a cog in this vast secret shadow machine -- when the majority of the damage is caused by corporations? And oh yeah, a movie about a pandemic when we're living in one that people want to be over and refer to this as post-COVID and people whip their masks off in joy on airplanes which already circulate air filled with illness.\n\nThis got dark quick, huh?\n\nCole says,\u00a0\"Maybe the human race deserves to be wiped out,\" but I'm still not so sure.\n\n*Credit for this goes to this article on\u00a0Little White Lies.",

I'll not develop this argument deeper because this film doesn't allow spoilers, but if you watch, you'll understand my point and probably agree. Bruce Willis in the 90s was at the pinnacle of his career (when he was actually caring for it, he did exceptional movies, like \"Pulp Fiction\", \"The Sixth Sense\", \"Unbreakable\" and this one), Madeleine Stowe was nice but she, from nowhere, acquires Stockholm syndrome (my only issue with the film), and Brad Pitt give us the funniest and one of the best characters of his career (for which he deservedly received an Oscar nomination). Terry Gilliam is a comedy director (he directed Monty Python), and because of that, the film is hilarious and the comic timing is perfect. Finally, that music theme is one of the best I've ever heard. Not only because it's contagious, but also because it purposely seems to contradict the movie's tone.",

In true Gilliam form we are served a whimsically wacky narrative with his aesthetic style written all over it. With this one you may have to hold on for dear life to understand, but unlocking the puzzle is part of the beauty of the film. Without question its a film that requires multiples viewings to fully grasp the unconventional visual display. Terry is a true visionary. Brad Pitt is exceptional here, one of the biggest Oscar snubs of all time. Bruce Willis is also fantastic & really channels some serious emotion matching well with Madeline Stowe who truly makes her on screen presence known in every scene.  \n\nOne thing we've learned in the past when speaking of time travel is that there is usually an inevitability that is impossible to avoid.",

Those who know Bruce Willis's work as an anti-hero won't be disappointed either, as his performance is riveting. The opportunity to move beyond simple hero tropes was seized firmly by Willis, who holds our attention throughout, despite the script getting a tad confusing at times. Brad Pit is terrific too, though fans of his smooth, urbane persona might be shocked. A time-travel sci-fi with a downbeat ending, 12 Monkeys is a must for fans of the genre.",

It was depressing to see the venerable Christopher Plummer allowing himself to be demeaned in that scene in the van.

The remaining survivors will go underground.\nTerry Gilliam directs a post apocalyptic flick starring Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Christopher Plummer, and Brad Pitt.\nEvery human has to wear protective gear from head to toe even when going outside. \nJames Cole is a prisoner but the higher power scientists give him a chance to reduce his sentence in order to give the human race a chance to go back above. Stowe is Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist assigned to him. Cole is declared mentally unstable believing it's 1996 when's actually 1990. Turns out he was sent back from the future in the late 2030s. He's then put in an institution with a man named Jefferey played by Pitt. Jeffereys father is a renowned scientist played by Plummer specializing in experimenting on animals which displeases him. Before he was committed Jeffery decided to rebel and form an underground resistance called Twelve Monkeys. His own father may be the cause of all the suffering Cole is trying to prevent. Cole's mission is to gather intel about this deadly plague so he can save the human race later. Might have something to do with the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. Eventually Cole is sent to the right time and runs into Dr. Railly again, she's of course skeptical of his ramblings but realizes he might actually be truthful. \nIt's true the past cannot be changed only the future. Maybe the only truth is mankind's insatiable appetite to destroy itself is the inevitable that cannot be avoided. Perhaps there is no escaping fate or destiny. Psychiatry is the latest religion, what experts say goes.\nThe possibilities of this movie coinciding with our current covid-19 situation is evident. It shares an Orwellian tone along the likes of a dystopian future in the movie Brazil. A society existing in a cold concrete world of minimalism and technology. Yes the time travel theory isn't perfect but it's possible.\nThe film acts more like a psychological-drama than a straight up apocalyptic action thriller. It's a sci-fi movie that preys on apocalyptic fears.\nCole keeps seeing visions of a shooting in public but is any of it real? His hope is to release humans from their underground dwellings much like animals in cages. \nTerry Gilliam juggles big ideas, time-travel paradoxes, breathless action, and inspired performances. He captures an unstable present that veers towards the inevitable. The filmmaking techniques are something to appreciate too full of Dutch angles, cockeyed compositions, wide-angle lenses, herky-jerky camerawork, and blown-out lighting, and that frenetic, over-the-top lensing. Gives such a perspective of the fractured state of mind. \nBig commentary about capitalism, environmentalism, masochism, and extremism. \nNow this movie lands with a more truth to it. It's vision is more prophetic and it's emotions and psychology match what we are facing today. Everything is dingy and dark with death lurking around every corner.\nWillis and Pitt are tremendous with such a smart premise, a well-developed construct of the future, and uncertain fears of illusion vs reality. \nSuch a sad ending too but it cleverly ties everything together.",

Cinematography is nothing much other than that, mostly dull scenes taking place.\n\nThe script is fantastic, love how they tie everything together.

My favorite part has to be Brad Pitt's acting to bring his character to life. Psychological thrillers are my favorite genre but this falls a little flat in terms of executing the twists and turns I expect in a psychological thriller. Admittedly, the theme of a virus causing a dystopian world in the future kind of hits close to home while watching it in 2020, and gives it a more eery and dreary effect.",

            "content": "Although it isn't even close to the brilliance of Brazil, 12 Monkeys is another example of the other side of Terry Gilliam. Early on, while watching every Gilliam film, I was frustrated with the fact that every movie he made seemed to try too hard to be another Python movie. Now, I think it's safe to say that I am officially out of that period. Rather, 12 Monkeys has shown light to the other side of Gilliam, which, in a lot of ways I prefer. This new side of Gilliam, though, has a very strong trend in all of his movies. Every one of them has a strong relation to mental institutions. Fisher King, Brazil, and now 12 Monkeys, all have very strong references to mental illness. In a lot of ways, that first act of 12 Monkeys in the mental institution is probably it's best. In those scenes, we start to recognize what kind of a character Bruce Willis is. On that note, I honestly haven't ever been a huge fan of Bruce Willis. In 12 Monkeys, he's mediocre at best. The real actor that shines in 12 Monkeys is Brad Pitt. He plays crazy incredibly well in the movie, personally, I think the performance was even Oscar-worthy. The next few beats in the story aren't quite as good. For the majority of the second act, 12 Monkeys takes on the role of a demented road trip. After that, it's mostly chaos. These final beats were fine, but I didn't think they quite held up to my expectations from how good everything plays out at the beginning. 12 Monkeys is incredibly relevant in the middle of the pandemic as well. I feel that if I had watched this movie a couple years earlier, I'd be like \"woah, crazy, unbelievable, science fiction stuff.\" But, right now, a man coming back to the past seems like an average Tuesday afternoon. As for the time travel, often, time travel is handled quite well. However, I have never been bothered by time travel plot holes throughout my movie watching time. The only thing I found lacking with time travel, and with the rest of the movie, is the visual style. Gilliam has always been able to illustrate the strangeness of everything, however, it seems as if he didn't fully utilize that in 12 Monkeys. In fact, the visual style was really just bland, sometimes even unappealing, but that was far from often. Still, the movie offers a mystery that is compelling and unique enough to have a good time.",

His psychological sci-fi thriller 12 Monkeys (1995) is as bizarre as Gilliam gets as director with strange imagery and mental patients. Gilliam's direction is both dreamy to look at and muddled in a confusing mess. He switches things around on the audience so fast that I became unsure of what was even happening on screen several times. Thankfully, he's got such an expressive directorial style that you can still glean what is going on thanks to context clues and bits of dialogue. Terry Gilliam took the French short film La Jetee and made it his own with his uniquely off brand direction. Roger Pratt's cinematography looks sweet and memorable with dated parts of goofy angles and weird perspectives in other parts. 12 Monkeys is a blast, but an unnerving one.\n\nMick Audsley's editing is sort of the issue for me as he cuts around the time travel, so that you are disoriented and never quite sure what is happening. Unfortunately, 129 minutes of jumping around gets tiresome and makes the narrative confusing, especially with all of writers Janet Peoples and David Webb Peoples' cool plot twists. Astor Piazolla's suites are interpolated for parts of Paul Buckmaster's killer score, so much so that I'd say Astor composed the score for 12 Monkeys. It all sounds like passages from his legendary \"Libertango\" to me.\n\nJeffrey Beecroft's production design is so industrial and ugly for the future that 12 Monkeys looks cool and hideous, simultaneously. Julie Weiss and Eric H. Sandberg's costumes are playful spins on old sci-fi concepts as well as 1990's baggy clothes. It's fun to see Allen Weisinger's crazy make-up throughout 12 Monkeys too.\n\nBruce Willis is compelling as the lead. It's amazing how he would just take a beating for these old movies back when he actually tried acting. It's no The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but Willis is awesome in 12 Monkeys. He takes that hammy attitude from The Fifth Element and the man of action reacting to strangeness from the Die Hard franchise and blends them together into a cool protagonist named James Cole. He has great chemistry with the lovely Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly. She's throughout and erratic as needed in a neat supporting actress role for her. \n\nBrad Pitt steals the show as the insane anarchist, animal lover, mental patient, revolutionary Jeffrey Goines. His crazy contacts, hand gestures, rambling dialogue, and wacky delivery are quite entertaining. Christopher Plummer is excellent as his genius father Dr. Goines. David Morse has a memorable cameo as Dr. Peters. Jon Seda is interesting as Willis' fellow inmate Jose. In all, 12 Monkeys is weird, but watchable.",

Better than The Fisher King, but can't even touch Brazil, Twelve Monkeys grips you at parts and drops you at others. I swear, I had no idea it was about a virus that wipes out almost all of humanity, so I kinda freaked myself out there. Bruce Willis as James Cole and Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly had great chemistry with a nice arch but didn't need them to fall in love. Dr. Railly is a smart, cunning character throughout, but she's upset that Cole kills the man who is literally undoing his belt to rape her? Come on. All that being said, Brad Pitt as the mentally-ill, enviro-terrorist, Jeffrey Goines, steals the show every time he's on-screen, we just needed more of it. I especially enjoyed the recurring circus-like music for the Army of the 12 Monkeys. The story is interesting, even if at times it's difficult to keep up \u2014 which isn't the viewer's fault \u2014 but I object to that ending. That guy? Really? That guy? I don't mind at all that it's bleak. Don't mind at all that, when you think about it, all Cole's efforts were, from the start, for naught. But that guy?!? What were his motives? Who even is he? He looks familiar, I guess. In a few scenes. No. Change the ending and it's in the mid-high (80)s.",

Besides an ending that should have been cut one scene short, the misdirects are well-placed.  They leave the viewer a bit disjointed, but that's obviously the intended effect.  Both to mimic the emotional state of James Cole (Bruce Willis), and to successfully disguise the rabbit in hand.  \n\nThe pieces are right in front of you, yet the resolution is still a surprise, and a well-earned one at that.  And even with characters that are devoid of functional human connections, the finale manages a deeply sentimental resolution to the love story.  It is quite the balancing act, and Gilliam delivers a true original.  Like it or not, you won't question that it's different.\n\nFor me, this was the movie that showed Brad Pitt had true acting chops.  No long flowing hair machismo in this one.  He let his freak flag fly, and an all-time great career took flight.  The Academy took notice too, with his first nomination.  \n\nThe film's combination of off-kilter humor and sci-fi noir make for interesting bedfellows.  It captures a legendary director at his best, a Hollywood star at his peak, and another launching his eclectic path.  Edgy humor, a quirky love story, a weird vibe...oh the 90's.",

What makes this movie so interesting is that it negates this theory. It shows us that we can't go back in time to alter the future. But we can go back to learn something to take into the future. This itself is such a brilliant way of looking at things and sort of a realistic approach to life. I'll find myself looking towards my past to learn about something to take with into the future and implement it into my life. Mistakes, experiences that have happened, it's all important in the future and even more so in the now. \n\nYou see, this is what movies should do. Movies should make us think. They should make us reach deep down inside of ourselves and make us question a lot of things about life and make us introspect on our lives and life itself. What if time travel really existed? What if people from the past living in the present right now? What if life itself is just one big game and we should be playing it as such, like Scrabble or Monopoly? I guess we'll never know until we pass on to another life.\n\nOverall, a brilliant movie with striking visuals and an amazing storyline to boot. Will definitely watch it again.\n\n*On a side note, I wish Brad Pitt did more nutty roles.*",

            "content": "A deadly virus wipes out almost all of humanity in 1996, forcing remaining survivors to live underground. A mysterious group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to be behind the virus. In 2035, James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner living in a subterranean shelter beneath the ruins of Philadelphia. Cole is selected for a mission, where he is trained and sent back in time to collect information on the virus in order to help scientists develop a cure. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and an airport shooting. Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental institution on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe). There he encounters Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), a fellow mental patient with fanatical views. After an escape attempt, Cole is locked in a cell, but soon disappears, returning to the future. Back in his own time, Cole is interviewed by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message which discloses the location of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and asserts their association with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. He is given a second chance to go back in time, but another error results in him arriving at a battlefield of World War I. He is wounded in the leg and then suddenly sent to 1996. In 1996, Railly gives a lecture about the Cassandra complex to a group of scientists. At the post-lecture book signing, Dr. Peters (David Morse) questions her about mankind's sustainability on earth and points out that humanity's gradual destruction of the environment may be the real lunacy. Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it, and when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and set out in search of him. When they confront him, however, Goines denies any involvement with the virus and says that wiping out humanity was Cole's idea at the asylum in 1990. Cole convinces himself that he is insane, but Railly confronts him with evidence of his time travel. They decide to spend their remaining time together in the Florida Keys before the onset of the plague. On their way to the airport, they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group's major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines' Nobel Prize winning virologist father (Christopher Plummer) in an animal cage...\n\nRoger Ebert observed 12 Monkeys' depiction of the future, finding similarities with Blade Runner (1982; also scripted by David Peoples) and Brazil (1985; also directed by Terry Gilliam). \"The film is a celebration of madness and doom, with a hero who tries to prevail against the chaos of his condition, and is inadequate\", Ebert wrote. \"This vision is a cold, dark, damp one, and even the romance between Willis and Stowe feels desperate rather than joyous. All of this is done very well, and the more you know about movies (especially the technical side), the more you're likely to admire it. And as entertainment, it appeals more to the mind than to the senses.\" Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised the art direction and set design. \"Willis and Pitts's performances, Gilliam's atmospherics and an exhilarating momentum easily outweigh such trifling flaws in the script\", Thomson reasoned. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone magazine cited the film's success on Gilliam's direction and Willis' performance. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli believed the filmmakers took an intelligent and creative motive for the time travel subplot. Rather than being sent to change the past, James Cole is instead observing it to make a better future. Richard Corliss of Time magazine felt the film's time travel aspect and apocalyptic depiction of a bleaker future were clich\u00e9s. \"In its frantic mix of chaos, carnage and zoo animals, 12 Monkeys is Jumanji for adults\", Corliss wrote. \n\nTerry Gilliam is a director who never have and nor will take the easy way. I respect him for that. I reckon every movie he has been involved in has been a chaotic mess with various results. I reckon he needs that sort of project and environment to be able to deliver his best. However, he doesn\u00b4t always succeed. With \"Twelve Monkeys\" Gilliam moves in wellknown territories. The vibe and setting is close to \"Brazil\" but with a time travel setting. A sort of mix of \"Donnie Darko\" and \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" with a sci-fi vibe and a nod to how science and biological holocausts can collapse our planet. \"Twelve Monkeys\" is unique and original in many ways, and the storyline manages to keep the viewer on the right track throughout the movie despite a quite dynamic and fluctuant plot with present and future settings. Gilliam pushes the idea that one can't change the past and there\u00b4s a thin line between sanity and madness. The narrative is thought-provoking and I do enjoy that. When re-seeing it today Bruce Willis does Bruce Willis, while Brad Pitt steals most scenes as the warped Jeffrey Goines. What I also noticed is that the film is tainted by the 90s way of making films, lot of close ups and tilted angles. \"Twelve Monkeys\" is as said unique, but it didn\u00b4t create the same impact on me when re-seeing it as it did in 1995. Trivia: \"Twelve Monkeys\" is inspired by the French short film \"La Jet\u00e9e\" (1962); as in \"La Jet\u00e9e\", characters are haunted by the image of their own death. After Universal Studios acquired the rights to remake \"La Jet\u00e9e\" as a full-length film, David and Janet Peoples were hired to write the script. Under Gilliam's direction, Universal granted the filmmakers a $29.5 million budget and filming lasted from February to May 1995. The film was shot mostly in Philadelphia and Baltimore where the story was set. The film was released to critical praise and grossed $168 million worldwide. Pitt was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and won a Golden Globe for his performance. The film also won and was nominated for various categories at the Saturn Awards.",

The usual Gilliam techniques are used on a script that potentially was designed for a very different vision however it is Gilliam's uniqueness that makes this film stand out, let alone the fact that the cast members wanted to work with him whatever the cost. In most cases that was for very little. Gilliam's style combined with the solid a-list cast and performances make the potentially messy plot become overlooked. The absurdity of the narrative makes for intrigue and works with the time-jumping story telling. In hindsight it is definitely the perfect script for a director such as Gilliam. The score can feel out of place, the emotional development of the two leads relationship doesn't feel deep enough and there is a slight lull in the middle however this is a film that must be seen to see classy performances from actors at the start of long careers and a narrative that leaves questions open for you to answer yourself on either a second viewing or in discussion down the local.",

He does a great job of making us doubt Cole as an unreliable protagonist giving us hints that it'll all unravel like 6th Sense (Willis loves numbers and twists). On top of the set-design Gilliam mixes in a great  accordion theme for additional atmosphere within the fragile psyche. \nBruce Willis does a solid job of carrying the narrative, and Madeleine Stowe is memorably compassionate, but all the focus will be on 90's sex-symbol Brad Pitt's Oscar nominated turn as a crazy Jeffery Goines and deservedly so. Pitt's best roles are his weirdos, and he should play them more often.\nIn more recent news, the SYFY channel now has a new 12 Monkeys show that just debuted. If it turns out to be anywhere near as good as the movie I'd say it'll be a show worth investing in.

James Cole was chosen to go back in time to retrieve information regarding the plague in order to alter the history. A series of misfortune ensured with the faulty device, eventually Cole managed to convince a psychiatrist to help him stop the plague, will they be able to save the human race?\n\n12 monkeys combined the idea of time travel with psychological dissocation of the mind where the reality became a delusion. The theme is the exploration of Cassandra syndrome, named after the Greek princess who was able to have premonition but unable to convince anyone to prevent the prophecy from happening. \n\nThe acting was superb from all the main characters. Pitt played a mentally disturbed eco terrorist and played it so well. Willies' performance was incredibly excellent. The writing was fantastic, I love the dystopian version of the Los Angeles where crime and poverty ruled the city. The idiotic terrorists were depicted well too.\n\nThe cinematography was excellent too, I love the unusual angles typically found in horror film but used in a way to induce psychological displeasure. The sepia tone made the atmosphere all the more pessimistic. The cyberpunk set design was another brilliant addition to further propagate uncertainty and fear.\n\n12 monkeys is a milestone of the American science fiction cinema.",

But its Brad Pitt playing a lunatic who saves the day in the asylum where Willis ends up after being sent into the past.This is one of the best performace he has given till date.\n The best thing about the movie is that it generates suspense in the minds of the viewers whether it is time travel or just mindgames of Cole.The script is neat focusing on variety of things that happen in this corporate system. Also another positive of the film is the character played by the lovely Madeleine Stowe which is of Cole's psychiatrist. She adds the required charm in this dark time-travel loop. \n The ending is marvellous and really fits perfectly for the questions raised by the time-travel in the movie.I would have liked it more if it had on developed more interesting thoughts in the middle rather than using the same ideas. Anyways its worth a watch for all sci-fi fans.\n\nRATING: [3.5/5]",

Twelve monkeys may easily be one of he best movies ever made, best stories ever told, it's absolute immaculate perfection exceeded only by the sublime energy created by the madman and his psychiatrist as they race to undo history only to discover they have already sealed its fate and the path that leads them to first attempt to undo it at all...the great circle that LOOPER later tries to resell but with much less  impeccable absolutes. Pitts madness is awesome to watch, Gillian's character amusing and the story unravels like life itself, messy and unspeakable. Love this movie and everything about it.",

            "content": "The one Terry Gilliam film I saw in theaters is, coincidentally, my favorite. I'm naturally inclined to enjoy 12 Monkeys because time travel is easily my favorite plot device for a film. I love how Bruce Willis' actions each time he travels back seems to have a ripple effect for each other time he goes, and yet he is so adamant that nothing he does can change the future because the past has already happened. It did seem a bit inconsistent what information was making it to the future, but the authority figures in the future were ambiguous enough that it didn't really matter because they could just be holding back information. What makes 12 Monkeys more interesting than most movies of this kind is the fact that we are given enough evidence to believe that the time travel might not actually be happening. We are led down a psychological path that calls us to question everything we're being shown. Is James Cole a reliable witness for anything? I wish Gilliam had stuck with his instincts and left off the lines in the opening, because they sell the audience completely on the time travel aspect and force the movie to work harder to sell the fact that it is possible none of the future scenes are real.\n\nThe underground future world is typical Gilliam craziness. It looks like a miserable place to live, and makes it easy to see why Cole would become enamored with the past so quickly. I love the set of the asylum as well, because it feels uncomfortable, and unwelcoming. The 2 big performances in this movie are simply amazing. Bruce Willis is at the top of his game, as he wanders back-and-forth between sane and crazy. I love the fact that I'm never really sure whether he is going to lose it and kill someone, or not. Brad Pitt is absolutely perfect in 12 Monkeys. He is completely unhinged, and totally convincing as Jeffrey Goines to the point where I almost don't see Brad Pitt because he disappears into the role. When he starts ranting in that fast-paced way, I keep expecting that I'll lose track of what he is saying, and yet he articulates extremely well. 12 Monkeys has a nice ending that isn't quite a twist, but works perfectly. There are other movies that I like more that involve time travel, but this is certainly near the top of the list. It is one that I think everyone should experience, even if it's just for the great acting.",

            "content": "\"I am mentally divergent, in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?\"\n\nThat is the question that the audience has to ask itself during this sci-fi mentally ill time traveling futuristic movie. Is the lead character mentally ill or is he really on a mission traveling through time in order to find a cure to a deadly virus that has wiped off nearly all the population and forced the few survivors to live underground? Director Terry Gilliam has created a memorable sci-fi flick that like all time traveling films has a few in-congruencies but still manages to hold the audience's attention. Gilliam is better known for his work in Monty Python, but he's also directed different types of genre films like The Fisher King (dramedy), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (adventure), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (Fantasy). He has a pretty respectable filmography as a director, although I still think he did his best work in the 90's. This film has a strong screenplay, but it will be remembered for the strong performances from Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. Twelve Monkeys is a dark futuristic film similar in some ways to Blade Runner although it kind of diverges all over the place with so many ideas. This is an inventive film but I don't know how many ideas were taken from Chris Marker's 1962 short film, La jetee, which inspired this movie. The screenplay was adapted by David Webb Peoples (Blade Runner, Unforgiven) and Janet Peoples. His influence from Blade Runner seems to be mixed in the screenplay here as well. This is a very fun sci-fi film although full of really weird moments.\n\nThe film takes place sometime in the future after a deadly virus wiped out over 5 billion people and the few survivors were forced to live underground. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a convict who is sent by a group of scientists to the past in order to gather information about the virus. The scientists want to study the virus so they can create a cure and live in the outside world once again. Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990 instead of 1996 which was the year in which the virus began spreading, and he ends up in a mental hospital after attacking several police officers. At the mental hospital he is treated by Dr. Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and he also meets another patient named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) who happens to be the son of a famous scientist (Christopher Plummer). Cole at first begins to search desperately for the \"Army of the Twelve Monkeys\" because they are believed to be the group responsible for spreading the virus, but later he begins to question himself and believe that he might actually be insane himself. This is a puzzle that he will have to piece together with the help of Railly. \n\nThis is the puzzle that Gilliam invites the audience to solve along the way and keeps us guessing as the plot unfolds before our eyes. I'm not a huge fan of futuristic films, but Gilliam's vision here is pretty hypnotic and poetic. Most of the film actually takes place in the past, but there are several elements introduced that keep us guessing what will happen next. There were a few stand out scenes like the one in which Cole and Railly are at a movie theater and begin commenting on how despite having seen the movie before the perception of it changes every time, similar to what is happening with Cole through his time traveling. Does his presence in the past change things in the future? Can he find the virus on time in order to save the people in the future? These are a few questions that the film raises. The more you think about things the more flaws you will find, but that doesn't take away anything from this sci-fi film. I really liked Brad Pitt's performance here for which he received an Academy nomination, although he lost to Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects). The film runs a bit long, but it never ceases to entertain.\n\nRating: 7,1/10",

Between the original ideas and technical perfection, there would seem to be little room for performances but Pitt and Willis fill that space nicely. Specifically, for Willis this is one of his more emotionally developed roles in all his career. If there is a flaw with this film, it's the confusing inconsistencies it carries within the plot, which at times become too apparent to ignore.",

Engrossing scenario that gets better with time. Excellent acting. Interesting treatment of a fairly common theme. Great details. Nice conception of the future.\n\nThe actors. Bruce Willis plays the dislocated and slightly unhinged hero to perfection. Great acting. Madeleine Stowe is just right as the unwilling but open-minded participant. Brad Pitt's mad interpretation is pure genius and an obvious precursor of his role in Fight Club (review still to come).\n\nThe bad. The whole flick will not please everybody for its gruesome take, the slow development, and the logical conclusion, which I must admit is as it should be. It is morally disappointing and a slightly simple considering the circumvolutions of the story itself.\n\nThe ugly. Nothing ugly there, but the rawness of it all.\n\nThe result. Watch it.

Perhaps I'm just a lowly cynic who believes a film should actually make some damn sense, but when a world exists when nonsensical films cease to be made, I'll no longer act in satire.\n\nThis film lacked any and all sentiment. I didn't care for any of the characters. Not one of them had a shred of interesting points or personality (not including Brad Pitt's character, Jeffery). The ending is a highly predictable and unsurprising, leaving the film to feel like a lengthy borefest by the time it actually gets to the freaking point already, which is one of my major complaints. \"Mind-blowing plot twists,\" I think not. Mind remains successfully un-blown.\n\nThis movie dragged. And dragged. And... dragged... and I felt that the psychiatrist's role in the story could have been omitted and it would have told the exact same plot without fail. Her character had no point other than to scream and snivel every moment she was on screen, and whatever \"romance\" was supposed to be going on between her and the protagonist was lacking in any emotion, as well as significance. In every scene featuring this \"romance,\" it didn't matter, because it had nothing to do with anything. I didn't once feel that these two could ever actually be in love. They were just both so unlikeable.\n\nBrad Pitt's performance, on the other hand, was by far the only entertaining aspect of the otherwise snooze-worthy film. His zany, crooked-eyed psychopath may have well been the only character worth watching.\n\nThere's a lot to be said about those who tackle the concept of time travel films, and needless to say, it's not a good route to take when creating a movie. Every time travel movie has gaping plot holes that make it impossible to enjoy for someone like me. When a movie ends with me seeing how it couldn't have possibly happened (even from a fictional standpoint), it's characterized as bad to me.\n\nLastly, I have no idea what this movie was trying to accomplish, nor what it was trying to tell people. Was it saying time travel was good? Bad? That Eco-terrorists will one day rule or destroy the planet? It was just a flimsy excuse for a poorly done romantic drama involving a doctor and patient, with a very implausible time travel twist. And it was worse than I was expecting.",

Brad Pitt is serviceable in his role but any good comedian could have pulled off the same performance. Bruce Willis is awesome and really was the saving grace as far as I was concerned. The fact is, time travel films spend a lot of time justifying themselves. They have to explain the nuances to the audience many of whom grow weary of its deployment. Don't be fooled into thinking that time travel narratives were first being explored, they were not. Stories that work within strict confines like \"Memento\" or \"The Unforgiven\" make for better stories.",

Yes, it's better in quality of movie and Brad Pitt's performance is a lot better in this movie than that other one. I say that other one because i didn't like it and may did. People say that the other movie has a better center premise, but this movie has a lot going on and could get people lost. Though the center premise is fantastic and a lot better than that other movie. It hits key point on dilution, society, the mind, the way people think, etc. It's fantastic and most people underrate it. Overall it's one of the best movies of all time. 9.5",
