He is called back into action, however, when a cryptic terrorist (Jeremy Irons) takes New York City hostage in a lethal game of \"Simon Says\" and refuses to speak with anyone but McClane. Teaming up with a street-savvy electrician named Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson), McClane dashes through the city, trying to stay one step ahead of a murderous plot.",

            "content": "A Classic Action Film. It's a combination of Lethal Weapon & Dirty Harry done very well. The acting overall is excellent. The chemistry between Willis & Jackson is phenomenal. The jokes, clever situations they get in, and the bond they form is the best thing to watch. The villain is very good also being very menacing and memorable. Everyone else does a very good job also and never feels generic or forgettable. The cinematography is very well done. The special effects are incredible, the camerawork is excellent and the action scenes are very memorable. The only problem is the ending is a bit anticlimactic and there are several plot holes and convivences. (Why doesn't Simon just kill John when he captures them given how badly he wanted them dead before, the aspirin bottle, how did Simon's Goon not know about the switch) The music is very good also giving enough of a remix of the original with some new stuff as well though I wouldn't call it as memorable as the first. The editing is very well done also. It does jump around a bit with the School Bomb and them on the ship in the second half for a significant period of time but its still very well done. The only real problem is the pacing which is still solid. The first half of this is incredibly action packed and never feels bloated or over the top. However, things slow down and it becomes more of a thriller and does not keep the frantic pacing of the first half. The ending also which is ok is kind of a letdown. If the ending had been better or the several plot holes fixed or both than this would've been an all timer. But regardless anyone who is a fan of the actors in this, the director, or Action/90's films will love this. This is really good and holds up well. It's great to see a witty clever sequel like this so well done.",

It's a preposterous film of jaw dropping action and early 90s special effects. \n\nDirector Harlin weaves an over complicated story into something which is stupidly entertaining and highlights all of Willis' skills as an anti-hero.\n\nAnd another Christmas movie!\n\n7/10\n\nDie Hard With A Vengeance (1995)\n\nThe third film in the series is probably my favourite of all of the films, and a lot of that is down to Samuel L Jackson's appearance as Willis' companion. It's a triumphant performance. \n\nThe first 60 minutes of the movie are absolute perfection, almost intoxicating action sequencesl, with the lead characters at the peak of their skills. Unfortunately, the film falls away badly in the second half with the ending being a load of rubbish. \n\nA notable mention to Jeremy Irons for his performance as the movies main villain Simon. \n\n7/10\n\nLive Free or Die Hard (also known as Die Hard 4.0) (2007)\n\nTwelves years after the third film the quality of movie itself has dropped considerably, though the movie looks a lot better due to the advances in technology. \n\nThe story isn't remotely plausible, in fact it's rediculous, but with Willis wanting to revive his former character (for financial gain I'm sure) he goes all out, balls to the wall, pushing his character well beyond his limits. \n\nAs action films go there's enough stuff blowing up here to satisfy action fans all over the world. It just needed more substance for me. \n\n6/10\n\nA Good Day to Die Hard (2013)\n\nOh dear! For anyone who loved the original films, especially the original, this is an absolute \nabomination.\n\nWillis is older now and just can't deliver the character we've loved for  over 25 years. \n\nIt's a Die Hard film in name only. Sub-par and terrible. \n\n4/10",

I am fully satisfied with this film's capacity of action and adventure, you won't be tempted to fall asleep during this thriller. I loved the scene in which Zeus is in the subway station ready to answer a phone call from Gruber while an officer threatens to arrest him. It is identical to the robbery scene in The Incredibles in which has almost the exact same setup! It's hilarious to watch. This is a worthy follow-up to the first two movies in the franchise and contains all the thrills everyone wants to see in any Die Hard movie. Love it!",

Thankfully, Die Hard 2 avoided the typical sequel trap of dishing out \"more of the same\" by expanding the Die Hard stage from the confines of a single building to the expanse of a major airport and its surrounds. That created lots of opportunities to implement fresh ideas in the pivotal action sequences. Die Hard with a Vengeance attempts to raise the stakes once more by expanding into an entire city, but unfortunately it ends up delivering the dreaded \"more of the same\". The storyline has a few good plot points and twists, but overall the film still feels too familiar. Samuel L Jackson plays the role of an unlikely side-kick to Willis' character. Jackson seems typecast as the angry black man, jelling most of his dialogue in a typical angry tone. The banter between Willis and Jackson is fun, even if many of their scenes are at ridiculously unrealistic. The final battle between the head bad guy and Willis' character is a bit anti-climatic. Die Hard 3 will pass the time, but is a bit of a disappointment after 1 and 2.",

But it is a pale imitation of the first movie, having all been done before.  So they drag out the baddie plot, to the point of ridiculousness until it resembles a James Bond flick.  Any half way intelligent baddie could have achieved his goals in about a quarter the number of steps.  Dumb.  Of course, the running time is longer, but now I just felt exhausted at the end.   This isn't helped by the Jackson sub plot, whose nephews get trapped by the baddies' bomb, etc etc ... cheesy and unnecessary.  Jackson himself is likeable and an energetic foil for Willis, but the racism thing was either unnecessary or needed more backstory to explain.  Instead we get 'Jackson is black, and therefore MUST have a chip on his shoulder towards white people', which is of course, racist in and of itself.",

I really like how they treat Zeus as a person and not a sidekick, and his overall story arc, as well as McClane's, is truly fantastic. Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) is an incredible villain, who is both brilliant and intimidating. The plot in this movie has always been a favorite of mine and is extremely suspenseful. Not only, the riddles and puzzles that Gruber plays with McClane and Zeus is a great idea. The only trouble I have with the movie is the ending. The one released seems last minute and tacked on. I don't think it really worked. However, if you have the chance, check out the alternative ending, which fans, myself included, think is a much better ending. For that, I give \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\".... 5 stars.",

The whole white man joke got old real quickly and was repeated way too many times. However, Bruce continues to play John well, and the villain was better than the guy in Die Hard 2. The police characters were good and not idiots this time which was also an improvement. The plot was fine, but it's a bit silly having the bad guy as the brother to the villain in the original.

Bruce Willis is someone who I've always seen as a diamond in the rough type of actor, and this is proven further by his chemistry with scene stealer Samuel L. Jackson. Sure, the writing isn't great and there are a few potholes, but this is a well shot and just fun action flick. Things blow up, other things don't, and sometimes there's just a gag. Jeremy Irons's baddy is probably the best in the series and his performance is fantastic. So, Die Hard found a way to make itself even bigger-er than the previous two by making it more street level, and make it still be a fun, high octane action movie in the process.

Although most of the rest of the film plays with race politics in an interesting way (Zeus at the phone with the cop is a dicey moment given recent history) and its interesting pre-9-11 to see how brutal the train crash is. \nFortunately this is one of the only things in this movie that seems dated, just like the first Die Hard, McTiernan directs a clean, crisp, energetic and pacey intelligent action flick. It's got some nice musical theme incorporations, and it's got a very claustrophobic directing style that sometimes works, and a Lethal Weapon witty buddy repartee. \nBut the piece de resistance is Jeremy Irons' Gruber who is as silly as he is sadistic. He's a real genuine pleasure and him and the film is deeply sinister with real stakes even around the whole of New York. \nI have to admit I see this film through rose tinted nostalgia glasses, but I do love this film, it's fun, competent and modern with enough red herrings to choke ten cats and a great Shane Black sensibility. I do think it still holds up, but what the hell do I know, even John McTiernan called the plot \"frail and outrageous. I hope people enjoy its ridiculousness.\" I do Sir, I do.",

The result is a pretty decent sequel to the first two films: the acting is pretty good (Willis as the hero who is now tired of \"being at the wrong place at the wrong time\", Irons as the clever villain, & Samuel Jackson as the very reluctant, yet helpful (& humorous) civilian Zeus Carver) despite issues with the general dialogue & the action sequences are decent. However, it seems to me that while the cinematography was fitting for the mid-1990s New York City setting, I was more used to the cinematography of the first two films (which were fitting for the late-1980s, early-1990s setting); furthermore, the explosions seem not as impactful compared to the first two as well. Of course, times change so that - the cinematography - was to be expected, I guess.\nOverall, \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" is a pretty good sequel to the first films - a little less kick-ass, but it still delivers as another treat for fans of action films! Pretty awesome!\n\nAnd this time around, the film does not take place during the Christmas holidays like the first two films, but it does make references to the holiday.

Jackson and Jeremy Irons to the gallery of new figures John McClane has to traverse. However, I can't help but feel that there's a bit too much going on here at times. Juggling McClane and Zeus, the cops, and Jeremy Irons's character all at once does seem to get a bit too strenuous for director John McTiernan here for a bit, but by the time the third act rolls in, it all makes sense and its smooth sailing from there on in.

So it's insensitive for sure, and I'm not sure what they were going for by casting the black man as the racist, but Samuel L Jackson is in peak form so it can be...mostly forgiven. I take issue with Jeremy Irons' over the top performance (magnified when he and his goons put on 'flawless' American accents - like really, did he only hire thugs who went to Julliard?) but it kinda fits the film, I guess. He's just never terribly intimidating. Either way, a very fun watch, with a lot better one liners than the original.",

If I were to compare it to its conterparts, I would say it's not as good as Die Hard, but better than Live Free Or Die Hard, and much better than it's predecessor, Die Hard 2, which may be one of the most overrated sequels of all time. My favorite aspect of Die Hard With A Vengeance is the aspect of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson teaming up, and the concept works even better than I thought it would, and while not being as iconic as Hans Gruber, Jeremy Iron's villain is just as much fun, and when it comes to Die Hard, that is what matters most. Does the film provide the viewer with a fun experience? The answer is yes, and that is why I recommend Die Hard With A Vengeance.",

Reason Being is that though the second one was ok and was a bit to over the top, campy and clich\u00e9d at some points, this one is never that but rather a more successful and better sequel that actually ties into the first one, I won't spoil how but it definately works. The films main protagonists are Bruce Willis as John McClain, as always, and Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus and they both bring terrific performanes and both have great chemistry and wirk off one another beautifully and the same goes for the villain Peter played by Jeremy Irons. Another thing in this movie that is terrific is the action and tension, because, unlike it's predecessor's,John Mclain is everywhere and not solidified in one location which makes way for tons of great ideas and plenty of room for stellar action. The one flaw that I had with this movie, much like everyone else, is the ending (Now they're are going to be SPOILERS coming up so if you haven't seen it yet go see it than come back and finish reading). The film decides to go one direction which is the bad guy gets away and the heores lose which would've worked, because it's a new take on a Die Hard movie that we haven't seen before and I would've been all in for it, but unfortunately the film immediately changes the idea and has an asprin bottle tell him where they are hiding out at and when they're is only like 10 to 8 minutes left in the movie him and the NYPD go and destroy Peter and his entire army in a short amount of time and then the film ends making it feel rushed and leaving you to wonder \"Why didn't they just keep the ending where they lost because it would've been better. But, in the end, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is a great sequel that surpasses it's predecessor and is a great time.",

This time we have McClane sucked into the villain's plan as part of the villain's plan which is a neat shift in the script for these films. It adds a new element to the movie and gives a plausible reason for him to be there aside from coincidence. The addition of Samuel L. Jackson is also delightful because it gives Bruce Willis someone to argue with throughout the film. Jeremy Irons is a great follow-up to the amazing Alan Rickman, and I love his few scenes with Bruce Willis because they play off each other nicely. The villain's plot is much more intricate this time, but I love puzzling through it and trying to understand what was intended. It's nice to see John McClane on his home turf because we no longer have to watch him struggle for support from the other law enforcement, and it adds some emotional impact when some of the cops start to die. The biggest flaw in Die Hard With a Vengeance is that it still clings to some of the highly illogical action that was seen in the first sequel. There are several things that happen to McClane and Zeus that would kill an actual human being, but these guys are indestructible. Despite the super hero nature of the characters in the film, this is still the best sequel they've made in the Die Hard series and I'd gladly watch it again any day.",

Jeremy Irons was a great villain and his motivations were clear. The movie is very well paced and highly entertaining. Unfortunately, the last 20-30 minutes of the film are rather lackluster. The movie struggles to find a conclusive way to end, and has a very rushed feel to it. It is abrupt and makes the last half feel incoherent. However, this is a rewatchable thrill ride, even if it isn't all that original. Die Hard 3: With A Vengeance gets 3.5/5 stars (B).",

They make a great pair, have some good fitting humor, and are as believable as can be expected.  It has a good pace, always some action and chases, and racing to the next pay phone.  Acting and script are both good, the story is cool and not far from the others, and I am surprised the bad guys get as far as they do given the movie they are in.  Until the very end the German criminals have the upper hand, (of course they are again from\nGermany, because we don't have bad guys here) and their well thought out plan goes smoothly.  It has a large scale feel, and between the two stars, Kruger and John we see a lot of action and excitement.  It's a well done, fasted pace thriller that keeps you guessing and solving riddles until the abrupt but satisfying ending.  Second best film in the classic franchise, and the last before the new reboots.",

            "content": "Die Hard: With a Vengeance would have been the best first sequel. Not only does it incorporate the first film in a very smart way but it also adds quite a lot to the story and makes the sequel feel bigger and better, although not better than the original, in the best way possible. \n\nThe film starts off with a bang, literally, and it cuts right to the chase with the story. It's an interesting change of pace and seeing as how there is easily enough story to cover the running time, it is more than welcome. The film also does not take place on Christmas, which again, is a nice change of pace and more than welcome but they make a few jokes about it though and they are funny. The story for this film is very interesting and very different, it takes place in a much more open location, the location where he is actually a police officer, and works really well; the script is also as good as ever and really funny too, the chemistry between Willis and Jackson was outstanding and they had me laughing a lot.\n\nJohn McClane is still as awesome as ever and the script is still written in the perfect way for him. The addition of Samuel L. Jackson is brilliant and they work him into the story in a really good way and these two seem to have started a trend that lasted for the next couple films. Jeremy Irons is brilliant as the villain, I won't say his name because that would ruin it for those who don't know but he stands out and is unforgettable, he really does an excellent job and is a fantastic addition. He also has iconic music as his leitmotif, similar to the first film, and not only does it fit really well with him, give the film more identity and that it mimics the first films villain but it's also from another Kubrick film, like the other songs were, which is a nice touch- even if it might be a coincidence. \n\nThe action in this film is excellent and is very entertaining to watch. The film takes place all over the city and everything is always changing, the film has a very good sense of tension and dread and there is just chaos everywhere but not in a bad way. The longer the film goes on the panic in the city gets bigger and bigger and he filmmakers did their job because the film manages to sustain that feeling throughout the whole film. The film also has an excellent elevator scene, which, like the catchphrase, has become a staple of the series but this one in particular is excellent and I haven't seen a more tension fuelled elevator scene with perfect set up again until The Winter Soldier. And it's all accomplished without McClane killing anyone in the first hour, awesome.\n\nI only have two complaints. They shouldn't have visually revealed who was behind everything when they did and kept it in suspense for a little while longer, I can't say much else because it's really hard to talk about the plot in this film without spoiling it but I'll just say, if they had just kept it in suspense for a little while longer and revealed who it was in the bank scene, that would have been great. Also, I think the film should have ended a few minutes earlier than it did. The film looks like it is wrapping up but then goes on for a few more minutes and I don't think it really needed to but it gives us a chance to hear the catchphrase one more time, so there is that. It's different for a film to end that way but it feels really tacked on and added after the fact, though. It's weird.\n\nNevertheless, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is an excellent film and sequel and probably my favourite sequel out of them all and the fact that it has a rotten rating, at least at the time of writing this, baffles me. Adding many new elements but keeping the core basics of what make a Die Hard film work, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is a fantastic sequel and a very enjoyable and exciting watch. This would have been a great end to a trilogy if this was the last one, regardless of what critics say.",

Ever since Bruce made me die laughing in blind date and blew my mind on moonlighting I've been a die hard fan (pun intended). Bruce didn't need to nearly destroy nakatome or freeze his ass off in the first two movies to impress us but he did. However, nothing could have prepared me for how perfect this third instalment was. The brilliance of the heist and decoy bombs, the hilarious teaming and execution of Willis and Jackson following Simons riddles around the city, the scale of the destruction and access to the gold, the charm of the trucker, the dark and weird villains, the washed-up hero recipe all combine for what is easily a movie hard to beat. There's a kind of poetry to this sequel that is hard to deny and a sort of new cleverness that indicates someone behind the wheel is steering with new intensity and passion. The attention to details is beyond belief. I'm grateful! Thank you!",

With a Vengeance has a bit of everything, as is the most similar to 4.0.

Rather than everyone's favorite rouge cop stumbling into another again, this movie does something different. This time trouble seeks him out in his hometown of New York City. Not only that, but this time another innocent civilian finds himself implicated in John McLane's crisis. It is nice to see a reshaping the template from the first two movies. There is no \"here we go again\" generic sequel feeling to this. Samuel L Jackson brings intensity as Willis' informal partner. Bruce Willis still delivers exactly what a movie like this needs. He is just as tough and stubborn as ever, but has the qualities that make us care about his character. He and Sam Jackson work well together. Another nice touch is how this terrorist threat links back to the conflict from the first movie. Jeremy Irons makes another worthy British villain. His bomb threats, riddles, and scavenger hunt approach to his dastardly plan move the story along well, and continue to change in a gratifying way that builds good suspense. The only letdown is the showdown in the final scene. These movies are not supposed to be realistic, but this last scene takes things a little too far. Still, when everything else works so well in terms of the story, the action, and the characters, this is forgivable.",

The action takes place in New York city and has everything a good action movie needs: lots of shooting, high speed chases, a great villain and a slightly humoristic note. I would also like to mention the soundtrack, which was very well chosen. With Bruce Willis (Die Hard, The Sixth Sense), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Jurassic Park) and Jeremy Irons (Beautiful Creatures, Kingdom of Heaven). \n\nAfter a bomb goes off in the Bonwit Teller department store in New York, a man who calls himself 'Simon' (Irons) telephones to the police and claims that he has placed more explosive devices in the city. In order to stop them from going off, he demands that John McClane (Willis) performs a series of childish tasks. The first one is to wear a sign saying 'I hate all niggers' in the centre of Harlem. It doesn't take long before shop owner Zeus Carver (Jackson) notice him standing on the street. He goes outside to talk to McClan, but can't prevent a group of teens wanting to beat him up. \n\nBack at the police station, Simon calls again. He wants McClane and his new made friend Zeus to go to a certain location and solve a riddle. Doing so, the two men get to know that one of the bombs is on a subway train. Who is this crazy Simon? And can they stop his bombs that threaten New York?",

            "content": "\"Christmas with the McClanes\" came a little early in 1995, so much so that they just finally decided to scrap that whole Christmas theme, outside of a few cute, but somewhat forced winks at \"Die Hard\" and Christmas fans, either because these films are running together too much as it is without the Christmas theme, or because the \"Christmas in July\" novelty was old back in the '80s and '90s. I don't know about a Christmas theme, but this film is certainly bringing back John McTiernan, or at least I think they are, because, like I said, the first \"Die Hard\" and \"Die Hard 2\" ran into each other so much that I couldn't even tell the difference between direction. Well, if Renny Harlin was, by chance, key in their decision to give \"Die Hard 2\" the subtitle \"Die Harder\", then you can definitely feel his absence, as \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" is a pretty cool title, even though I doubt the effectiveness of a vengeance exacted when you're dead, and in a hard fashion no less. You know what, I think this film's title gets a whole cooler when you see it on the poster, right above Samuel L. Jackson's name, which, of course, makes everything a little bit cooler. By that logic, this film's title, alone, was downright awesome five years later, when Jackson did a certain other cop film, because people could look back and think of this as the ultimate super-cop team-up between John McClane and John Shaft. Shoot, and on top of all of that, they're going up against Jeremy Irons, who was born to play a clich\u00e9d, intellectual terrorist mastermind, so they may as well have kept up the Christmas theme, as this is a Christmas present to action thriller fans if I've every heard of one. ...Nah, nevermind, because the filmmakers were right if they did, in fact, feel that, even without the Christmas theme, these films carried too many similar elements, including certain flaws that haven't gotten any less forgivable the third time around.\r\n\r\nAs much as I joke about how much this series' installments run together, seeing as how the first two entries were too close in content for comfort, this particular film is pretty distinguished from it predecessors, although it's hardly different from thrillers of its nature, and no matter how much the attempts at complexity work to settle predictability, it's pretty easy to tell where this trope-heavy path is leading, no matter how much it stretches on. Longer than the still draggy \"Die Harder\", this film runs around the same length of the original \"Die Hard\", which was, of course, by no means reasonable, so, as sure as sunshine, while there is a touch more eventfulness to this narrative than the ones, or rather, \"one\" followed by the predecessors, storytelling is still packed with draggy material and even some excessive filler. The final product is arguably not quite as overlong as one might think when comparing the layers of this story concept and the interpretation's final runtime, but this is still about as overdrawn as the first two films, as its story concept is still too thin to sustain a length of almost two hours and a quarter, no matter how many questionable paths they try to take. Sure, there are some cheesy moments in dialogue and comic relief, but it's the plot structure that is most questionably drawn by writer Jonathan Hensleigh, who all but convolutes the narrative with overblown set pieces, but not without placing some thinness to characterization. As one might expect, this script is hardly subtle, and it's hard to ignore this when director John McTiernan bloats his storytelling atmosphere with a momentum that may be fun in its tightness and all, but carries some sense of overambition that stresses problems, which are limited in quantity, but considerable in magnitude. What missteps there are in this perhaps intentionally flawed, over-the-top blockbuster are very recurring, and while I'm not asking for much out of this effort, this is still kind of an underwhelming thriller, like its predecessors. Of course, also like its predecessors, this film sure provides plenty of fun, enough so to succeed as an action thriller, complete with, well, some thrilling action.\r\n\r\nNot quite as directly brawl-driven as the first two installments of this series, this film's action aspects even deliver on thrilling non-combat set pieces whose tight momentum reinforces a sense of race against time, while the hand-to-hand, or gun-to-gun, or explosion-to-explosion set pieces that we all know and love about this franchise prove to be well-staged and choreographed, with a certain intensity and slightly over-the-top grandness to both entertain and keep up some tension. What combat there is is as thrilling as it usually has been in the series, at least up to this point, and when we're looking at relatively simple chase sequences, you can also expect plenty of thrills, yet this is still a less action-oriented installment in the thriller saga, so don't expect too much biting action. Of course, that's not to say that the story, alone, doesn't have some bite to it, because even though meat is limited, partly due familiarity and largely due to this flick's being barely, if at all less minimalist than its relatively simple predecessors, the formula is distinguished from the formula followed by \"Die Harder\" and \"Die Harder\" for you to gain a particularly firm grip on intrigue, which is very present, thanks to riddle-driven complexities and other colorful, if questionably drawn attributes that trip up the mind in a fairly fun fashion, often complimented by tension, and near-consistently brought to life by John McTiernan. McTiernan is about as bombastic in his storytelling as he was when he worked with the first \"Die Hard\", but an overtly brisk pacing does more than just beat you over the head and flavor up thrilling action, sustaining a velocity that graces heights in conflict handling with tension, and never lets up on a colorful atmosphere to entertain thoroughly. McTiernan's storytelling is tense about as often as it is faulty, yet fun never abates, driving the film, at least as a fluff piece, complete with all of the thrilling action and \"complexities\" that I addressed earlier, as well as the colorful performances that you might expect from a cast like this. The supporting players are pretty decent and all, with Jeremy Irons being convincing and even morbidly charming in his portrayal of a flamboyant and dangerous intellectual antagonist, but it's the leads who really keep things going, with Bruce Willis not being given the dramatic material that he sometimes had to reinforce a sense of consequence in the first two films, but still delivering on that classic action star charisma, which Samuel L. Jackson all but matches with his trademark, over-the-top intense charm, whose bonding with the charm of Willis produces a delightful frenemy chemistry that does much justice to the buddy aspect which drives this particular \"Die Hard\" installment in a lot of ways. Willis and Jackson keep the momentum up about as much as anyone, and there are plenty of people and aspects to sustain a fun factor, which ultimately crafts quite the entertaining thriller, regardless of the shortcomings that we've come to expect out of films like this.\r\n\r\nOverall, while this film is distinguished from its predecessors, by no means is it all that distinguished from formulaic thrillers of its type, featuring bloating in both unsubtle storytelling and length to only stress the natural shortcomings that secure the final product as underwhelming, yet are challenged enough by thrilling action, an intriguing narrative, thoroughly well-paced direction and a colorful cast - headed by the delightfully charismatic duo of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson - that \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" is able to stand as a fun, if overtly fluffy third round in a classic popcorn saga.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson play off each other perfectly, the action is well choreographed and exciting, and Jeremy Irons is competent as Simon Gruber.

Simple - Employ the services of John McTiernan as the Director. Would you seriously believe that even with a Power Cast of Bruce Wills & Samuel Jackson and larger than life crash-boom-bang stunts - they could not give us a decent sensible movie??? Terrible Script, Horrible Characterization, Miserable Directing and most Irritatingly Obnoxious Dialogues to add to misery to this Festering Foolish Film. Makes you wonder - how does Bruce Wills Character not suffer the misery of banged up joints, smashed muscles and inhuman stunts that goes with age? And then in the end - he not only loses a lot of blood, but also his shirt (he always does) and yes - he successfully kills the villain in the most comedic & humorous methods possible. \nWatch it when you are doing the dishes or mopping the floor. You would be spared the suffering I had to endure. \nOverall Rating - 2 out of 10\nLoy Machedo\nloymachedo.com | loymachedo.tv",

            "content": "This movie is exciting, fast and thrilling; it rides hard on the action leaving little room for story depth just straight forward action with unbelievable acting by the leads and the movie did not have any of the other main cast from the first two movies, regardless this movie is just a wonderful action movie that we all should get the thrill of seeing.\nThis is one wonderful Die Hard addition, as our hero is paired with another great actor Samuel L. Jackson as McClane goes up against a vengeful terrorist, who is here for one reason payback as McClane took down his brother in the first Die Hard movie but payback was just part of the check list also making out with over 140 billion in gold from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was also part of that list.\n \nThe movie starts with a big explosion, and unlike the first two McClane was in full control of what was going on, a twist from the previous 2 films and a welcome twist if I can say so myself. The second Die Hard movie (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) ended with McClane and Holly walking off happy, this starts with McClane all washed up from a split from his wife.\n\nThe movie plot is about a man who called himself Simon who goes about detonating bombs in New York. Simon now calls the police department and started a game of Simon says, and the pawns were John McClane (Bruce Willis) and Zeus (Samuel L.Jackson). Zeus came onboard the train ride when Simon asked McClane to go to a black neighborhood wearing a sign saying \"I Hate Niggers\". Zeus saved McClane, and Simon made him and McClane run around New York City trying to stop bombs, till McClane and Zeus got ahead of him and finally took him down with a \"Yippee kai yay, motherfu@#er\".\n\nThis movie is directed by John McTieman who directed the first movie and the movie is based on the characters created by Roderick Thorp, and Samuel L. Jackson was praised for his role in this movie as he was just wonderful playing Zeus Carver and the villain Simon, played by Jeremy Irons was not as grand as Alan Rickman who played Hans Gruber.\n\nLike Hans Gruber said in the first Die Hard (1988) movie, \"John Wayne doesn't always walk away into the sunset with Grace Kelly (with John McClane correcting him that it was Gary Cooper)\", so is this movie set. As our hero becomes more and more ingenious with how he saves the day, we are given some reality as McClane's life at home is going down the drain and in the end of this one his wife is not hugging and kissing him all over.\n\nDie Hard with a Vengeance cost 20 million more than the 2nd movie in the franchise and it made over a 100 million more than the previous Die Hard 2, making its total box office gross over 360 million (from a 90 million production cost). After this the producers waited over 12 years before they made another Die Hard movie, which was released in 2007 Live Free or Die Hard and a follow up six years later A Good Day to Die Hard (2013).\n\nI love this movie, and Simon says, \"Everyone should go see this\" because to me this movie was better than the second in the franchise.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

The secondary bad guys (and girl) are really good in this one too- a big scary guy like in the first one and a vicious female character for good measure. The plot is decent with there being comedy, action and an interesting premise even though it does fall over itself somewhat as it goes on.\n\nIts an interesting action film and that's what Die Hard should be- it's not just about the action scenes (they are great in this one but there's maybe not enough of them) it's also about pushing the boundaries of the genre and taking it somewhere different- this one does a brilliant job of that- the most monotonous wild-goose chase imaginable with two leads whose eyes are saying \"I'm too old for this shit\" (Yes, I like Lethal Weapon too) and yet there's action, drama, intensity, comedy and strong character development all round too. It also does a remarkable job in creating the atmosphere of NYC with a particularly memorable opening scene- one of many extras that makes this film a classic.",

That should be the end of the review right there (too... much... awesome). John McTiernan (director of the first Die Hard movie) returns to deliver a sequel that's grittier, darker and just as action packed as its predecessors. A lot of critics gave this movie crap but to be honest they were way too harsh because this film is incredibly underrated and completely worthy of its title. \"With a Vengeance\", has John McClane in a place in his life we haven't seen before; he's an alcoholic, left his wife and got suspended from the police force. McClane gets brought back into the fray by vicious terrorist bomber Simon (Jeremy Irons) who has a personal vendetta against McClane involving his past. So John, along with some help from a shop keeper named Zuess (Samuel L. Jackson), must stop more bombings from taking place while taking down Simon and his overall operation by playing a series of mind games throughout the streets of New York. Where the second installment (Die Hard 2) followed the structure of the original too closely while expanding in all of the wrong areas (using the same enclosed plot in an airport setting), \"Die Hard 3\" does the opposite; it changes the game entirely by making a completely different action movie. Making the grungy streets of New York the primary setting was smart because it adds that much more weight to the mounting tension the film tries to build while adding some new elements altogether (car chase scenes, public interactions and weather conditions). This movie works more as a crime based action/thriller with a constant ticking clock element present. The film doesn't waste any time throwing us head first into the action but it still spends the appropriate amount of scenes developing characters and showing us just how far the hero has fallen (McClane's addiction and home troubles). Simon (Jeremy Iron) is an excellent villain; he's cold, calculated, intelligent and always plays games with the hero and the audience's mind. He ranks overall second best next to Hanz Gruber (Alan Rickman) in the whole series and his relation to McClane's past adds an interesting overall dynamic to the story. Zuess (Samuel L. Jackson) is a great character who has good chemistry with the beat down McClane adding some more comedic chops and wit to the movie. However, \"With a Vengeance\" is not without its flaws; it's too long, focuses too heavily on racial/stereotype based humor and lacks a little bit of the charm the original will always carry with it. Though shot well enough, the action in the movie is mostly gun related and is missing a lot of the great hand-to-hand combat the other Die Hard flicks nailed perfectly. All in all, this is a completely acceptable sequel to a great action film series and anyone who's a fan of action or Die Hard should definitely see this one.",

If McClane doesn't do as he says, then he will blow up anything from a subway to a school in New York.  McClane gets help from Zeus(Samuel L. Jackson) a guy who saves his life in Harlem, and they try to stop Simon and find out why he is doing all this.  John McTeirnan was the director of the first movie and this is the only sequel he came back for, probably why it's the best.  The action is phenomenal, the story is exciting, and Irons' Simon is the best of all the villains in the series, besides Hans Gruber.

            "content": "\"Die Hard With A Vengeance\" is John McClane (Bruce Willis) at his best. First and for most, like most action or superhero films, the villain is almost as important as the protagonist, in that there must be a charisma in that person that keeps the audience watching, acting as almost a focal point for the plot. Alan Rickman in the original \"Die Hard\" is almost unbeatable, in character and performance. But introducing Jeremy Irons into this third film is genius and he carries this role with a vigor lacking from the villains in \"Die Hard 2\". The supporting roles are much more fleshed out in \"Die Hard 3\", more so than any of the previous installments, helped mostly by the big name face of Samuel L. Jackson being apart of the entire film and almost initiating a sort of buddy cop film. Touching on issues of terrorism and racism tend to date this film, but being the first \"Die Hard\" to take place in New York, there is a uniqueness to this film that makes it better than the rest. Tack on a plot that keeps you guessing, splitting the film in different sections, with John playing \"Simon Says\", to John finding out the pivotal secret, to John chasing Simon (Irons) through tunnels. Everything about this film screams action and Bruce Willis produces some of his best work in this third appearance as McClane. \"Die Hard With a Vengeance\" proves to be my favorite \"Die Hard\" film yet.",

            "content": "THE GOOD- The action starts instantaneously with a boutique getting blown to bits.  The initial set-up for this movie is fresh and exciting with McClane and his reluctant partner (Samuel L. Jackson) skowering the city for bombs.  The rapport between the two characters is classic stuff and adds to the movie greatly.  The plot moves in a progression, from searching for bombs, to a big heist, to following the bad guys and putting the kibosh on them.  This makes the movie constantly fresh as the movie never lags because of the constant developments.  The action sequences are excellent (the scene with the bomb in the subway).  Jeremy Irons hits it out of the park as Simon, a menancing, nuanced villian.\nTHE BAD- The last third of the film the realism sort of flies away.  One scene, McClane and Zeus (Jackson) fall a hundred feet from a bridge onto the deck of the boat and walk away from it. \nTHE DEAL- Despite the exaggerated sequences in the later parts of the film, it still works because the story is well layered and you want to see what happens next.  This is a great, classic action film.  Not only is this my favorite of the series (I used to watch this movie every day on VHS).  But this is one of my favorite movies of all-time.  Even if you are not as passionate about this film as I am, you will find it to be an at least 'good' action film worth watching.",

            "content": "Die Hard: With A Vengeance was originally meant to be more of the same taking place on a Caribbean cruise ship, but the idea was abandoned when Steven Seagal did that in \"Under Siege\". Two rejected screenplay later and the studio chose to make last minute changes to a screenplay. That screenplay was meant to be Lethal Weapon 4 and would have made sense since the buddy-cop dynamic has been established in that series, but as a sequel to Die Hard it mostly works adding a breath of fresh air for the formula.\n\nDie Hard: With A Vengeance has John McClane and a racist store owner force to play a bomber's deadly game as they race around New York while trying to stop him. It's slightly better than the second in some areas. The plot doesn't take place entirely in one area giving way to some unexpected events. The villain is much better with an intelligent plan that is far fetched, but mostly  makes logical sense. The buddy-cop dynamic allows for more humor, depth, and some room for the two too argue that's fun to see. It does unfortunately retain the over the top nature making you question the lack of logic. One instance includes McClane momentarily surfing on top of a truck in a tunnel that's being flooded. Moments like these take you out of the moment making you see it from your \"film snub\" (or critic) view point. Anyone who's not McClane and racist store owner Zeus are incompetent. Not just in poor police work, but we're also talking about basic human thinking. Like the worst security guard in action movie history repeatedly shooting a wall when he sees no one coming his way and his unintentional comedic death. Also seeing the villain execute his plan brings the pacing to a halt and the last minute twist in discovering the villain hideout is ridiculous. It retains some of the same problems, but offers something new to the formula.\n\nBruce Willis is once again excellent as John McClane. Though slightly less enjoyable since his character won't stop bringing up his headache. Samuel Jackson is good too playing an opposite character to that of Willis. When Willis and Jackson are on screen together give way to the film highlights. They have chemistry together and both clearly show they're having fun even with bickering with one another. Even when the pair are separated both manage to hold your attention. Jeremy Irons is an improvement as the film villain. He's as charming as he is twisted. The action scene in this sequel benefit from John McTiernan direction. Even with less gun fights, his brings plenty of energy whenever a fist fight, gun fight, and explosions occurred. However I do question John McTiernan decision to include a pointless sex scene just because he can. The editing could have shorten the film length some area. I felt there was certain parts that were unnecessary.\n\nDie Hard: With A Vengeance contains enough new ideas to succeed as a proper sequel and not simply rehashing the premise twice. The pairing of Willis and Jackson alone elevate the film from being a standard buddy-cop action film.",

In this third installment, creatively titled as DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE, the space is now widened to New York City. While the familiar sense of claustrophobic tension is getting lesser this time around, fans will be delighted that original DIE HARD director John McTiernan made an exceptional comeback to the franchise he first started back in 1988. The good news is, DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE is marginally better and more engaging than the slightly lackluster DIE HARD 2 (1990). But like DIE HARD 2, the overall execution isn't as tightly focused as the original movie.\n\nhttp://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2013/02/die-hard-with-vengeance-1995.html",

Unfortunately, the story's overly complicated and falls apart in the last act.  Additionally, the villains are underdeveloped and don't feel organic to the plot.  Still, McTiernan does a great job at crafting dynamic and intense action sequences that grab the audience.  And the performances by Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jeremy Irons are fairly strong.  A bit contrived and over plotted, Die Hard With a Vengeance doesn't live up to the previous films, but it still manages to deliver some exciting thrills and explosive action.",

While Die Hard With a Vengeance (aka Die Hard 3) is still not as good as the original, it comes pretty damn close! In John McClane's (Bruce Willis) latest adventure, a terrorist is placing highly concentrated bombs all over New York City. If the NYPD wants him to not set the bombs off, he demands that McClane do everything that he tells him in a game of \"Simon Says.\" During his first task, John is saved by Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), an innocent civilian, from being attacked by a gang of people because of a controversial sign that he has to wear. Now, Zeus is caught up in this exciting action film as John's partner, and together they must work to stop the bomber before anymore innocent lives are lost. I really loved this great entry into this great series! Once again, Bruce Willis does an amazing job as John McClane. I've mentioned why in both of my early Die Hard reviews, so I'm going to move on to Samuel L. Jackson. The man not only plays John's partner very well but also creates very funny comic relief. Every time he opened his mouth, I was busting a gut! Plus, the two men had great chemistry together and pulled the film along quite nicely. I also enjoyed the main villain in this film. The way that he spoke slyly was very threatening and believable. Now, while I did love this film, there are flaws. They weren't big, but they were there. The issue that I had with the film is the way that it's written. There are points where I was able to predict some of the \"twists\" in the film. Fortunately, the writer had a few tricks up his sleeve and pulled some twists that I never saw coming, so it balances the whole thing out. Die Hard With a Vengeance is a great addition to the Die Hard films! It can be a bit predictable at times, but you'll completely forget about as you're sucked into this well done movie!",

John McClane, now suspended from the NYPD, jumps back into action when a terrorist bomber requests his contact.  This film ties in with the first one and features a nice blend of great action scenes and even some comedy.  Samuel L. Jackson was the real standout performance for me.  This movie does a great job of getting rid of the bad taste from the previous sequel.  Fun and enjoyable, 4 stars.",

In most \"Die Hard\"s John McClane takes down wave after wave of henchmen with guns or even his barehands.  For most of this movie, he is solving riddles or elementary school math problems.  I might be less harsh if it was another action movie, but it's not.  It has \"Die Hard\" in it's title and that means something.  The few positives are when the action is there it is good (ex. - elevator scene) and the pairing of Bruce and Samuel L. is pure poetry.  It's just a shame that their genius had to be wasted on this dud of a script.",

Direct references to the first two instalments are kept to a minimum in an excellent screenplay which amounts to Dirty Harry on steroids. Willis and Jackson are a great double act.

Die Hard WIth A Vengeance is an action classic in my opinion and might be one of Bruce Willis's best movies. The main plot is that Gruber's Brother is planting bombs all over L.A. When McClane is called out of his suspension, he is asked by Simon Gruber to play a game of Simon Says with him leaving clues all over the city where the bombs are. When he tells him to wear a racist sign on him, he meets Zeus who owns a store and explains to him why he is doing this. Zeus saves him from Da hood and is partnered with him for the rest of the day trying to find Gruber. This is the definition of a buddy film. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are one of the best partners in film ever. Just put them together in a blender and you get perfection. The villain is one of the best. He is so sinister and threatening. Samuel L Jackson is the best thing in the whole entire movie with his amazing performence as Zeus. The action scenes are some of the best in the series with an explosive subway scene. Die Hard With A Vengeance is the best film in the whoe series.\n\n94/100 A-",
