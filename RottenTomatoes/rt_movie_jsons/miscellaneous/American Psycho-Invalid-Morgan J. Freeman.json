    "summary": "Rachel (Mila Kunis) is a criminology student hoping to land a position as a teacher's assistant for professor Robert Starkman (William Shatner). She's sure this position will pave the way to an FBI career, and she's willing to do anything to obtain it -- including killing her classmates. The school psychiatrist, Dr. Daniels (Geraint Wyn Davies), becomes aware that Rachel is insane, but Rachel is skilled at her dangerous game of death and identity theft.",

He directed this movie, then went on to produce Laguna Beach, 16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom.\n\nBut this movie\u2026\n\nI had no idea that there was a sequel to American Psycho, much less that the movie wasn't originally intended to even be a sequel. It was a script titled The Girl Who Wouldn't Die and it wasn't until production began that the film's script was altered with the incorporation of Patrick Bateman.\n\nIn fact, the author of the original book Bret Easton Ellis claims Lions Gate wanted to include a serial killer subplot in The Rules of Attraction and he turned them down, so this was the movie that resulted.\n\nSo yeah, remember that Patrick Bateman? The guy who we were left wondering is he or isn't he a serial killer? Well, this movie forgets all that nonsense by starting with him on a date with lead character Rachael Newman's (Mila Kunis) babysitter. While the 12-year-old is in the other room, Bateman kills her and dissects her. But Rachael turns the tables by stabbing him with an icepick.\n\nNow, she's nearly all grown up and studying criminology in the class of former FBI agent Professor Starkman. That's part of her insanely obsessive path to becoming an agent herself. And he's played by William Shatner and our protagonist is in love with him, so if the idea of a 71-year-old Kirk being pursued by a 19-year-old Jackie, well then this is the movie for you.\n\nKunis attempted to stop production of American Psycho III, saying in an interview, \"Please \u2014 somebody stop this. Write a petition. When I did the second one, I didn't know it would be American Psycho II. It was supposed to be a different project, and it was re-edited, but, ooh..\"\n\nIt's astounding that this exists, that it has at least two well-known actors and that so few people are talking about it. Also, it has a cat get microwaved and despite how much I usually enjoy Kunis, I struggled through this one.",

From the Morgan Freeman who is not the voice of God from Shawshank Penitentiary (and who is white) comes a lame pile of shit. American Psycho 2 is very unfaithful to its source material. In fact, this movie was not even supposed to be of American Psycho ilk.\n\nThe film stars Meg Griffin as a serial killer. I mean imagine just the annoyance of Mila Kunis's voice as she's narrating her diatribe of how she is trying to scheme her way to the top. She might as well be chewing bubble gum over the voiceover because she sounded like this role didn't matter. Hell, even Amazon trivia said Mila regretted taking this role. The way she acts doesn't signal cold, and calculating. This film's attitude does not follow in its predecessor's footsteps in any fashion whatsoever. This film is like some teenage struggle film. Where's the satire? Where's the shock? Where is any homage to Bret Easton Ellis's novel? Nowhere. This film is just another soulless cash grab.\n\nThis film honestly could have been a 2 star film, but you had to drag in Patrick Bateman.

Instead, it plays out like a mix between a teenage college flick, a comedy and a PG rated slasher film.  Miller Kunis plays a quirky and demented college student who slowly kills off classmates in order to win an assistant position.  Every kill in the film is not shown and it made me wonder how this movie got an R rating because it wasn't bloody or gruesome at all.  They attempted to throw in some comedy bits and most of them fell flat.  William Shatner was great as the professor but the rest of the cast was forgettable.  The one strong point in the film was the storyline.  There was a bit of mystery and the final segment revealed a big twist that was very entertaining.  This movie wasn't horrible like it may appear, and should satisfy someone looking for a little fun serial killer flick.",

This one doesn't deliver, and personally I think that it was pointless to make this film as it has nothing to offer. The film has poor acting, the cast is horrible, the story is bad and the directing is sloppy. American Psycho 2 contains all the traditional elements of a straight to DVD title. The film also has miscast roles including William Shatner as the professor and Mila Kunis. I felt that nothing really clicked, and the film was simply bizarre. As far as I'm concerned, American Psycho was a perfect stand alone film that had plenty of unnerving and disturbing elements. The film is sloppy with no effort in trying to create something watchable. The film simply tried to cash in on the success of the first by using rehashed ideas, This film insults Bret Easton Ellis who wrote the book. Fans of American Psycho should pass up on this at all costs as it is a poorly crafted film with no good payoff or story for that matter. While American Psycho had great psychological horror elements that really made it a disturbing film to watch, this film lacks those elements and it just doesn't deliver. This an awful train wreck of a film that will displease fans of American Psycho. The film is one of the worst sequels that I've seen, and being straight to DVD it's no mystery why. Sequels like this should give film studio a clue not to invest money into garbage like this.",

Not even Mila Kunis who plays the female psycho is able to save the movie and look threatening which is quite sad and I don't understand how this film manged to go away with an R-rating compared to the first film. with all this bullshit in this film, this should have been rated PG-13 (USA), American Paycho: All American Girl gets a 3.5/10.",

For those that remember the original one, Patrick Bateman was the American Psycho who got away killing many people, sometimes for trivial reasons like a better quality business card- seriously! The man was psycho! Anyways, this sequel finds Rachel Newman (Mila Kunis) as a 12 year old whose babysitter is on a date with Patrick Bateman. She is tied with duct tape and witnesses Bateman killing her babysitter right across from the table where she is at. Rachel manages to remove the duct tape and takes an ice pick, stabbing Bateman to death. The police nor the FBI ever discovered who killed Bateman. Fast forward to present day in America and Rachel is a freshman in college, with one goal in mind: to become Professor Starkman's (William Shatner) TA. Starkman used to be a former FBI agent who tracked down serial killers and Rachel sees Starkman as her ticket to enter the FBI Academy in Quantico VA to become an FBI agent and specialize in tracking down serial killers- how ironic right? So Rachel will eliminate anyone who stands in her way to become a TA and eventually graduate from college in criminology to attend the FBI Academy.

Not even Mila Kunis in the lead role, who typically is very charming and watchable on film, can save the disastrous script, poor direction, and deplorable pacing of this movie.  The fact that the film has the \"American Psycho\" moniker is an insult, as the only scene connecting it to the original film is a obviously tacked-on moment at the start of the film.  While the original was a razor-sharp, funny, and darkly satirical look at the greed and excess of the 80's and how it corrupted a sense of decency and compassion in the average yuppie, this film is about a spoiled brat girl who decides to eliminate anyone who she feels is in the way of her criminology career.  There are long periods of dead air in the film, the death scenes are lame and childish, and Kunis' role in this tries to have the similar darkly comic tone as Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman, but Kunis doesn't hold a candle to the inspired lunacy of Bale's performance.",
