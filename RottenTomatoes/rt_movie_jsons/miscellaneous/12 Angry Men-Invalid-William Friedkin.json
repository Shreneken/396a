    "summary": "In a remake of the 1950s classic, bias and group-think influence the deliberations of a dozen jury members. Initially, one of the jurors (Jack Lemmon) is the only roadblock between the panel and unanimous conviction of the Latino alleged murderer they've been called to judge. But the all-male jury's negotiations prove fluid, and as the hours pass, more and more of the dissenter's peers come over to his side. Before long, the trial of an oppressed youth becomes a meditation on social justice.",

Trials and of course their accompanying jury deliberation rooms simply weren't the same.  Any murder trial taking place in the 1990's wouldn't be compressed into mere days,  When watching a film, \"suspension of disbelief\" is required but this is just so far-fetched the viewer can't do that.  Watching the 1957 version doesn't present that problem, which is why the earlier film holds up and the remake sucks.  I gave up on this one as it was clear it couldn't possibly offer anything new to the story.",

It jumps out at you as something more, almost as if you're there with the 12 men making the decision they are. Each actor does a fantastic job and brings a great deal to their role, especially important since the story is purely character-driven. Its runtime passes by quickly because of its immersion, and by the end, I found myself wanting more. I wanted the story to continue thanks to how brilliant it and the cast were. This is a film I will always praise and suggest to all, even those who aren't fans of movies. -Fennett",

            "content": "This movie has provided many good and negative examples of negotiation. For instance, sing facts alone to defend one's position will also be unhelpful because opinions are often also subjective rather than merely objective. This was shown in the movie where the juror who firmly believed in the defendant being guilty, based his positions on seemingly factual evidence from the crime scene and claimed that the \"facts are undeniable\". However, this only caused the disagreement to stagnate as the juror's objectivity could not address the subjective opinions of the other jurors. Furthermore, it is important to not blame others for having an opposing position. One instance of this occurring during the movie was when the aforementioned juror claimed that the juror who was convincing the others that the defendant was not guilty, had \"never been wronger in his life\". This example shows that blaming fails to separate the people from the problem and may show that you are not open and are unwilling to work together to resolve the problem. As a result, the opposing party may become defensive as well and will either be less open to understanding your position or will even become more hostile.",

In fact, the evidence against him reinforced their initial negative impression of him, hence furthering their claim that he is guilty. Yet, Davis saw the boy as a living human, whose life is just as important and meaningful as anyone else. With this perspective, the principle of reasonable doubt resonated with him, causing him to vote that the boy was not guilty. Hence, it is important to regard facts that call one's own perceptions into question instead of ignoring them and only choosing to reinforce your prior perceptions, as it could lead to discrimination and generalisation.",

            "content": "Some remakes attempt to distinguish themselves by taking a familiar premise in an entirely different direction. Others try to remain faithful to the original and distinguish themselves through acting or effects. 12 Angry Men (1997), is an example of the latter. This modernization of one of the classic legal dramas hits all the major plot beats of the original. The \"modernization\" part comes in largely through the addition of four black jurors to the twelve men in the jury room (and I do mean men - all the jurors are male, possibly due to a literal reading of the title). One of these jurors, Juror 10, is a former Nation of Islam member with a hatred of Hispanics, but he serves a similar function to the bigoted white guy he replaces. There is also a brief discussion of the relevance of psychiatric testimony, not present in the original, which does not drastically alter the outcome of the deliberations. These changes don't substantially distinguish the film from its predecessor, but it at least manages to avoid torpedoing itself.\n\nThe performances are where the film distinguishes itself. By the typical standards of television movies, some major stars are involved, and they are capably directed by William Friedkin, who is a director I greatly respect for his role in The French Connection. Unsurprisingly, the performances of the film are excellent, if perhaps not quite up to the stratospheric level of the original. The performances in the remake of 12 Angry Men also make the 12 men appear even angrier than the original. Granted, the exchanges in the original were occasionally full of a fair amount of vitriol, but the remake is fairly shouty, although it generally avoids becoming hammy.\n\nThe film's script does little to differentiate itself from the brilliant 1957 version, but the acting is impressive, and the performances give the film a different tone to the original. Watching this film is equivalent to watching a famous Broadway play, then years later seeing a modernized version of the same play in a local theater, starring a different set of talented actors. The experience probably isn't going to be quite as good, but if you enjoyed the original, it might be worth a watch.",

Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott presage their conflicts in the later made-for-TV remake Inherit the Wind as the two jurors who refuse to budge from their convictions that a murder case does and does not have reasonable doubt attached to it, respectively.\n\nAs with the original, 12 Angry Men is really an ensemble piece, the first American example of avant-garde filmmaking on a mass scale; with the exception of a few brief flashes at beginning and end, the film takes place in two adjoining rooms, a jury room and a men's room, allowing the director no scenic latitude at all and forcing him to concentrate on the actors themselves. Friedkin, as Lumet before him, gathers a mix of the well-known and the underrated from all corners of the Hollywood backlot, gives each a speech, and goes to great pains to ensure that those who espouse even the most controversial views are as charismatic as those who are warmer and fuzzier. In other words, this is an actors' movie, pure and simple, and if you enjoy watching actors do what they do, you'll get a kick out of this. ****",

            "content": "The movie \"12 Angry Men\" directed by William Friedkin will overall hook the viewer movie with strong emotion and several intense moments. The movie gets the point across: the importance of detail along with having an open-mind is key to successful decisions. 12 Angry Men's form of showing that a human life is worth arguing over is worth the time spent watching at the edge of the seat. The movie bring the viewer perspectives through many different eyes and many types of emotional connections.  \n\tThe movie starts with one man's decision to plead not guilty. The man pleading not guilty, Davis, is almost single-handily responsible of saving the kids life. The way Davis brings pleads not guilty to the 11 angry jurors is very logical and intelligent. By using strong details that change the minds of the court room one by one; Davis leads the court room into the logical progression of facts just like a professional lawyer would. The moment where the viewers and jurors started to become doubtful on their decisions is when Davis present the same type of knife as the victims on the table. The major twist and presentation of the knife is priceless and is a majoring turning point of the movie's intensity level. The wonder of mystery of how and why Davis has the knife leads the viewers to believe that he is on to something bigger than just a rebellion against the group. The movie, after the knife is presented, starts to intensely pick up. Davis is clearly the main person of the movie.\n\t Each character in the movie is unique and very well thought of. No two jurors seems the same. The unique characters bring different perspectives on the case. One of the jurors is a man raised in the same type of way as the kid on trial. Throughout the movie, viewers can sense the man's emotional connection to each bit of evidence. The man can relate mainly because he could at least relate through the struggle the kid is going through. Another unique type of character is business man who is always indifferent to the case as the evidence is presented. I thought this is because the man has no prior experience with this type of life style and has no common ground to connect on. The man and the kid's life style are too different for the man to make a reasonable decision. I find each characters view's on the case in question one of the movies strongest and most creative element. The fresh views bring a sense of completion to the case. All the different interjections by each character makes the case feel complete and leads the viewer to feel happy about the ending the movie. A movie that lets the audience connect to the story's feeling will always be one to remember.\nThe best element the movie has to offer is how the characters bring up evidence. As I previously explained, each character brings a unique perspective on the case on a personal level. Each bit of evidence had a unique emotional response from each character. For example, Juror #4 presented his form of evidence like he was a professor. When Juror #4 presented the fact that he could remember the name of a movie even under extreme emotion stress he was very polite when proved wrong by Davis. If any other character were to bring up the same bit of evidence the reaction would have been very different. The movie often made me think what if the cranky old juror #3 would have been proved wrong in the same way juror #4 would of? I think juror #3 would have reacted the same way as he did when he threatened to kill Davis. The characters react in such a unique way makes the movie stand out in very different way. Without any type of backstory the audience can predict how each person will uniquely present arguments. \nThe general idea of the movie may sound boring to some people, but will surely surprise the viewer. The movie is full of intense emotional drama that makes for a good show. The peak of emotional tension leads juror #3 and Davis to get into an argument. Beforehand juror #3 brings up the point that if the accused kid says \"I am going to kill you\" he most certainly means it. As juror #3 gets to the breaking point he becomes enraged and burst out \"I'll kill ya!\". Davis quickly responses with \"You don't really mean that\". After that scene the viewer could tell the intensity of the actions by each character is changing their view points. This scene is important because it really made me think about what I believed personally about the case. I felt as if I was in the jury room with the 12 angry men. I found myself believing more and more on the non-guilty evidence as the movie went by, just like how the characters one-by-one went to the other verdict.\n\tThe main progression of the movie is fast and fulfilling, but the movie also slowly brings a repetitive feel towards the end. Near the end of the film the points brought up seem to be already made, this may causing the viewers to become bored. The movie holds a sense of mystery of what the outcome of the jury will be, until a little after half way. Viewers pick up that the movie is going to end with everyone pleading not guilty but the movie continues to drag on about pieces of information already brought up. Yes, the information they bring up is very important to the case, but the sense of wanting the movie to \"just end already\" is still felt. The director was on the right track of refreshing the viewer near the end. For example, when juror #3 was the only one left to change his vote, he had an episode. This scene was enough to cause the break in repetition, but it felt like it was out of character. There is not enough back story on the man to judge whether or not a mental breakdown is in character or not. If we were judging based off the movie, it seemed confusing and not natural. The focus of the movie is not about getting to know the characters, so the question of character is not any reason to ignore watching it.  \nThe movie \"12 Angry Men\" mixes the elements of emotion and intense character actions in such a way that makes the movie hard to keep away. The movie shows the importance of every bit of detail in a way that is amazing and unique. Each character in the movie shows importance and significance, making the movie a must watch for people looking for a classic. There is no point of avoiding this movie if you are looking for a well-directed trip into the jury room.",

That said, this new version has something missing from the older one. Maybe its the fact that I've already seen this story, that I know what happens and how it does so, but in terms of compelling-ness, I feel that the first film is superior.

He is being accused of knifing his father to death. 12 jurors retire to a private room to establish if the boy is guilty or not guilty. The only issue is that all 12 men need to have the same opinion. Henry Fonda (Juror #8) starts off as the only man thinking the youth is not guilty. He doesn't think the evidence adds up. He slowly persuades some of the others to see why the crime doesn't make sense.\n\nEvery actor in this movie has a very different personality. Some are in a hurry to get to a ball game. Some sweat a lot. Some don't sweat at all. Some sway where ever the wind blows. Some can be merciful and some can be executioners. Yet all 12 play a major role in whether an 18 year old lives or dies.\n\n12 Angry Men  was released in 1957. It's a film listed in the Criterion collection. It is also found on the IMDB top 250 list. 12 Angry Men is proof that a movie doesn't need to be in color or filmed in a trillion different locations to be interesting. Without seeing any of the trial the entire story is explained in one, very hot, room by 12 different men. This movie is a must see for everyone.",

There are now blacks on the jury (that wouldn't have been very big back in the 50's), some of the scenes are a wee bit different, but mostly well intact. They got the perfect cast to replace the perfect cast of the original. Every single actor fit their character, particularly Jack Lemmon and George C.
