(Of course in original language due to the lack of English and Italian, luckily there were English subs).\nIn the complex the direction is pretty good, I appreciated the idea of showing the huge fields of India and the lack of light during the dialogues to make them darker.\nAbout the dialogues, they're well written but could be better.\nI would have expected some scenes with traditional Indian dances, scenes that Bollywood has given us over the years without restraint.\nThe fact that this film has disappointed my expectation only makes me happier.\n\nConclusions:\nthe film is good and is a good way to pass the time, the story is fascinating, well shot scenes and fairly well written dialogues.\nThere aren't action scenes, the entire movie is built around the interactions between the characters. I suggest to pay attention to the dialogues, you could end up learning interesting things about Indian culture.\nHonour mention to the soundtrack.",

The title is sardonic since the movie shows the caste system to be alive and well.  I'm pretty ignorant of Indian society and politics so I found those aspects of the film a little hard to follow, and things get a little preachy at the end.",

I loved the fact that in spite of Anubhav Sinha being so focused on the main plot, he could integrate so many side plots that just felt as if they were happening in the same town, but the focus was not on them. Love the fact that the movie felt so real, it was as if you were literally transported to one of the same districts in U.P. or Bihar. The cinematography was truly amazing, the camera work just is so well done you actually feel you're in the movie. Last but not least, the point that the movie drives home is amazing, it's one of those movies where once you walk out of theatres, the principles, the values and the messages still remain in your mind to ponder on.",

Why? Cause of the too much inclusion of the other sub plots.\n\nThe main subject of the film was on the Castecism, Rape, The cruel reality of these Isolated places situated all over India but the makers somehow manages to bring up Political agendas, Rallies, Protests and all these Side issues unnecessarily into it.\n\nIn my humble opinion, the film itself had so much potential and strength into it's base story that nothing has ever needed to add into it. The makers should have focused more into the main story rather than investing their resources on other not so important parts of the film.\n\nAs for the Performances, All the actors have done tremendously well, Everyone gave their characters justice! The technical aspects of the film just like I said before were on another level. And the Screenplay & Plot despite the shortcomings successfully holds us until the end.\n\nIt's a pretty decent movie for the message and social awareness it produces but the unnecessary additions (Incl. The Main Lead's Fiancee Character) hampered the overall experience.\n\nIt could have handled the main concept much more maturely.",

Anubhav Sinha, who already proved his mettle last year with the very intimate and deep film 'Mulk' which actually discussed Islamophobia, this time captures the horrors of caste system prevalent all over India. The structure of the characters is similar: there are interesting supporting characters playing the organs of governing system, and their is a wonderfully written duo of characters fighting the problem (Ayushmann Khurrana and Zeeshan Ayyub in 'Article 15', Taapsee Pannu and Rishi Kapoor in 'Mulk') but what makes this one a- somewhat- better ride is its thrills and performances. Ayushmann Khurrana is wonderful as Ayan Ranjan, the foreign return police officer posted in a punishment transfer to a town in Uttar Pradesh and the unsettling crime. With it's restrained depiction of the horrifying aspects of India's caste exploitation and a traumatizing observation of these mishaps and unfair practices, the film's dialogue is wonderful: it gets intimately close to the real world, and it deserves a thundering applause for even being a film made in India which defines the backward classes, not with respect, not with abuse: but as they are, in the most raw and poignant form.",

This inconsistency in the pacing is my main gripe with the movie. Aside from that, I thought the performances were very good and the main story was very engaging.

Although, I felt that Ayushman Khurana was constantly at unease while playing the part and was not able to soak himself within the character and felt new to the issues and genre, actresses and actors like Sayani Gupta, Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub, Manoj Pahwa, Kumud Mishra took centre-stage with their emboldened performances and character arcs. The movie's power matrix and nexus is dynamic, there is no unsettling cheesy, mawkish glorification of anything of any kind and the movie keeps it grounded and real in its essence. The struggle to bring culprits to justice, the battle of getting victims exonerated and saved from the clutches of power-hungry, disruptive, manipulated law and order wins the audience. The climax shatters the superficial societal, legal roles and makes one think hard on the reality one faces just 100-200-300 kms far one's home. The swamp or the quagmire stands for a lot and the slippers of one of the abducted girls in that swamp becomes analogous to the situation of India grappling with its multifaceted problems in today's highly modernized yet helpless era.
