His performance was convincing and sincere, and this has made me decide that I'm also going to watch Brothers (2015) next week! However, I wish the direction sat well with me. Loved the supporting cast!",

Vikram Batra - the movie is quite shallow in its depiction of heroism. Watch it to have a good time for a couple of hours, because despite its narrative shortcomings, Shershaah is a film that is impossible not to fall in love with.\n\nFinal Rating: 72/100",

The plot and dialogue were acceptable, but various plot points were extremely predictable, there was a lot of generic romance, I'm not convinced it was completely accurate to the true story, and the ending felt too abrupt. The characters were likeable, but some were a bit silly, most felt unoriginal, and nobody besides the main character really received much development. The main character was also presented in a faultless light. The pacing was reasonable, and the acting was solid considering the script. However, some of the cast looked a bit too attractive and clean to be in the military profession. The action was a mixed bag, with scenes being dragged out because people wanted to run into the firing line with no cover rather than just throwing grenades from behind cover. The main character also would have been killed early on in some of the fight scenes. Finally, the sets/props/costumes looked decent, and most visual effects weren't bad, but there was some shaky, handheld cinematography, and the soundtrack was too repetitive.",

            "content": "\"Shershaah\" does fall into some biopic and Bollywood movie tropes, but for the most part is still a solid entry in the war movie genre. It does a good job respecting what the movie is about and I thought most of the movie was fairly convincing. I thought there was plenty of intense action in the movie, but I would have liked some more exposition and depth to the main character. I think he is likable and easy to root for and empathize with, but some things definitely could have been explored further. I also thought the way the story presents an event near the end of the story at the beginning didn't make a lot of sense here and could have been edited differently. Nonetheless, this is a very competently made war movie that limits the more overdramatic tendencies of Bollywood movies to a minimum and is well worth checking out. It's one of those movies that I actually think could have benefitted from a theatrical experience if the circumstances were different, but as it stands, it is worth watching on the biggest screen at your disposal ideally with a good sound system. I think this because it is very immersive in many of the more intense moments and I felt entertained and even very emotionally invested by the end of the movie.",
