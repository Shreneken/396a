I deeply regret wasting an evening on this thing. Run while you still can.",

He is a first class jerk with a capital J. Ultimately, I get the point of the movie. But it's no where near enough to make me like this film",

I don't want to reveal any spoilers, but I'm just saying these film ticks along with no ending, the description is deceiving. I was shouting come on!! Towards the end. What's good about it, is it's a realistic take on what could happen in this situation and the father's devotion to his son is really sweet. Would not recommend it though",

            "content": "A new Romanian drama on Netflix. A wealthy father struggled against nature as he would not stop at anything to rescue his son, who was lost in the snowy mountain.\n\nThe synopsis really sounded like this movie would be an intense thriller. Instead, this was a deep and bleak character study of a father who tried everything to save his son. Going through Letterboxd and Rotten Tomatoes, I saw that many did not like this movie, and I believed that they did not understand the message. \n\nThe father character is not a nice person. He's an affluent man who tried to use all his wealth and connections while manipulating and coercing others to help him. For him, others' safety did not matter too much to him. This did not make the father a likable character in audiences' eyes. However, I still found this movie to be powerful despite its depressing color because it showed the resilience and obsession of a parent, regardless of how good of a person the parent is. It should not be surprising that even some of the most evil persons would do anything to keep their loved ones safe. The father character was selfish and a bully, but being on his shoe, I doubt that many parents would do any different. \n\nAs I said before, this is not some thriller or tear-jerking drama. It's very slow, and the ending would leave many unsatisfied and even annoyed. However, for me, this ending effectively emphasized the theme of how parents would never give up on their children. Even more powerful was the fact that the movie was based on a true story. \n\nOverall, a unique drama about the power of parental love. 8.5/10",
