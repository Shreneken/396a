The dialogue and writing of the characters is very well done and it elevates the story. Just like other Studio Ghibili movies, the animation is jaw-dropping. The scenery is beautiful in every shot. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. There isn't really any negatives other than that I feel like the pacing can be a bit off but that's just a nitpick on my part. Overall, a fantastic love story that doesn't fall into the typical cliches of modern day movies.",

What seems to be the main conflict is the main character's struggle to figure out what they want to do with their life: stop school and become a writer or prepare for high school entrance exams and give herself more time to decide. One of the stories seems to help supplement the main one while the other doesn't give much drive to it and could have been honestly scrapped altogether. The film's main focus is of a child and her dreams. It is lovely to see her drive to do something great and the character's she imagines on the way. The message is clear and a good one so it hurts to see a love story seemingly shoved in the middle of it that somewhat distracts from that. Overall a great film that tries to teach children a great lesson about following your dreams.",

The music is gorgeous and never feels obtrusive, and the song is absolutely lovely. The script is memorable too, while the simple yet very rich story still manages to touch me, as do the beautiful, subtle messaging and great characters here. Shizuku and Seiji are both likable characters with real warmth to them. The voice acting is excellent from all involved, especially Cary Elwes who is perfect as the charming handsome Baron. All in all, stunning and one of my favourites. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Lately I'm becoming more and more bitter as a person and this certainly influenced my viewing experience, but even I couldn't but admire how beautiful and beautifully told this story is. Out of all Ghibli non-fantastical stories this will certainly be from now on my favorite. And while the main love story of the movie is an unrealistic fantasy so common to girls the age of the protagonist, feelings of Shizuku in all other regards are so, so real. Amazing, how this works despite the fact that no magic other than that of human imagination was involved. To all I wish that they could experience this story \u2013 Shizuku's first visit in that antique shop, the moment when she sang for the first time with Seiji or when she learned the history of the \"Baron\" figurine... And the opening, of course, but most of all \u2013 the transition from fantasy to reality when she runs down her stairs on the slope of Tama Hills. I can't say how many times I replayed it, and I was amazed each and every time. The definition of imagination and probably my favorite Ghibli moment from now on. I am home.

The relationship, not only was it very sweet, motivated the main character to face her doubt and try out her passion. \n\nThe central theme was that everyone had some form of passion or talent within them: at the beginning the talent is unfinished and rough, but one must know that it takes time to polish the talent or passion. When one can overcome their self-doubts, they will be able to find their own identity. I love the positive and hopeful theme of the story.\n\nMy problem with the movie was that it was very subdued and seemed like nothing much happened for a while.

            "content": "Surprisingly mature romance anime for teenagers.\n\nYoshifumi Kondo's romance drama anime Whisper of the Heart (1995) is sincere to its heartfelt core. I found writers Hayao Miyazaki and Aoi Hiiragi's coming of age narrative really relatable as Shizuku just wants to find love and accept her passion for writing as a viable career path. Miyazaki and Hiiragi's story is very grounded and realistic as teenagers act like youthful fools in love, while taking their future increasingly seriously. I think their writing is what separates Whisper of the Heart from more shallow romance anime as he writes from a teenage girl's lens. It's nice to hear the feminine perspective on how dense boys can be, supportive girlfriends are to one another, and oppressive parents can be to their daughters. Hayao Miyazaki and Aoi Hiiragi's words will echo across time as more teens see Whisper of the Heart. \n\nI find Yoshifumi Kondo's direction will help viewers empathize with his leading lady Shizuku's relatable struggle for years to come. Whisper of the Heart creatively removes much of the fantasy elements with a few dream sequences as Shizuku writes her novel, we see a visual representation of the romance fairytale on screen with breathtaking style from Kondo. His down to Earth direction keeps you with Shizuku the entire time, so you are wholly invested in her arc. It's a shame that Yoshifumi Kondo tragically died after only getting to direct one picture. However, Whisper of the Heart is so stunning and moving that I'm grateful we received such a profoundly soulful and touching anime film from an inspired master before his untimely death.\n\nI adore the English Dub's voice cast for Whisper of the Heart. Brittany Snow is adorable and likable as Shizuku Tsukishima. She's got this soft voice and a fierce personality that fits Shizuku's opinionated character, but lets her be a teenage girl with high expectations. David Gallagher is great as Seiji Amasawa with his confident attitude and personable manner around Snow's Shizuku. Ashley Tisdale is wonderful as Shizuku's shy best friend Yuko Harada. Harold Gould is very gentle and touching as Seiji's grandfather Shiro Nishi, who is the elderly man running the antique shop.\n\nSimilarly, James Sikking is very kind and patient as Shizuku's librarian father Seiya Tsukishima. Jean Smart is funny as Shizuku's stern mother earning a Master's Degree named Asako Tsukishima. Courtney Thorne-Smith is excellent as Shizuku's concerned and mature sister Shiho Tsukishima. Cary Elwes has a small, but poignant role as The Baron, who is the talking cat from Shizuku's fairytale romance novel.\n\nTakeshi Seyama's sharp editing for Whisper of the Heart sends you soaring on a romantic adventure from brief encounter to encounter in quick time for a briskly paced 111 minutes. Atsushi Okui alongside Kitarou Kousaka's cinematography has beautiful wide shots of animated Tokyo circa 1995, but it is Okui and Kousaka's close-up shots of faces that hit you hardest. Seeing someone's eyes after getting rejected by a crush or appreciated by someone they love is very tender in Whisper of the Heart. \n\nFurthermore, I appreciate their gentle fondness for these characters and Kondo's direction is focusing on the characters, not just a story about love. Satoshi Kuroda's art direction is lovely with realistic backdrops of Tokyo, schools, libraries, antique shops, domestic homes, and even a fantasy world. Yuji Nomi's musical composition for Whisper of the Heart adds a layer of warmth and romantic atmosphere I love. His score is very amorous for Whisper of the Heart, especially as he uses not only symphonic orchestration, but heavy use of country songs like \"Country Road.\"\n\nIn all, Whisper of the Heart is a classic coming of age story, affectionate romance drama, and anime masterpiece from the late director Yoshifumi Kondo.",

If there is a major criticism from my perspective, it is the ending, which almost seems too unrealistically hopeful, but that can be construed as the blind glee associated with first love. Additionally, the lack of real conflict is notable, which seems to let the film slip into superficiality at points, but ultimately the level of antagonism seems like a fit for the protagonist and the setting. As the sole film from the studio directed by Kond\u014d rather than the more commonly encountered Miyazaki or Takahata, Whisper of the Heart brings up questions of what might have been had the young director not been lost before his time: would we have seen more films of this style from Ghibli? We can only speculate. (4/5)",

As late summer winds gently blow, we contentedly explore a sleepy Tokyo suburb alongside an aspiring, if apprehensive, young writer. Stumbling upon old thrift shops and secret city perspectives, we delight alongside her, mutually appreciating the sense of freedom and discovery. Little adventures can be the most satisfying, like these fleeting chances to probe and examine the private character of her home town.\n\nThat aspect of the film makes for some great, charming, slice-of-life material. And the relationship drama, after school is back in session, doesn't feel overwrought or exaggerated, either. It just... lingers and lingers, way beyond the point of watch-checking and brow-raising. Slow pacing is essential to those earlier scenes, allowing us to really understand and appreciate both character and setting, but it's not as powerful or purposeful in these later bits. Peppered with the usual Studio Ghibli joys and pleasures, it's beautifully realized and sincere, just a bit staid and long in the tooth.

It is the only feature-length film directed by Kond\u00f4 Yoshifumi, who was said to be Miyazaki's successor in regards to directing Ghilbi films. Kond\u00f4 sadly never got the chance to take up that mantle as he died three years later in 1998 and from what we see on-screen we may have never gotten \"Spirited Away\", but we would have still had a studio left in competent hands, and it is a shame that we will never get to see the films that could have been. On a quick note in editing, they could have easily shaved 5 minutes off of this film and still had it keep the slow pacing they were going for.\n\nW:\u00a0There is no writer in film that has a more successful batting average than Miyazaki Hayao. Paul Thomas Anderson is the only other figure as consistent as Miyazaki. However, the head of Ghilibi has written almost double the number of films as Anderson, and we can praise Hiiragi Aoi's source material if we wish, but I do not. Source material can be tremendous, but Shawshank Redemption and Oldboy are two films with weak source material and look at how they turned out. It is the writing and the dialogue that hold this movie together, however, the ending hurts the overall film. It feels rushed, and while I can see the merit in a Kawabatta-esque wabi-sabi ending. It feels unearned as if the writer had no idea how to continue rather than chose not to continue.\n\nC: I bet you have no idea who Okui Atsushi is and that is fine. I understand. However, you should as Okui might very well be one of the greatest cinematographers to ever exist, and that is no hyperbole either. Please look up their works and be amazed. Their use of the camera is excellent, and in this film, we see a consistent side-on approach to the characters that gives depth to what should ultimately be a flat shot. We then couple that with the angles that we get during exterior shots and we can feel that juxtaposition more so, thus allowing us to see these characters in a different light.\n\u200b\nA:\u00a0The four principal actors are Honna Yoko as Tsukishima Shizuku, Takahashi Issey as Amasawa Seiji, Tachibana Takashi as Tsukishima Seiya, and Muroi Shigeru as Tsukishima Asako. Their performances are average, which in a way gives the characters more authenticity in terms of presenting them as ordinary humans, but it feels like you could have gotten this effect without weakening the overall performance of the piece.\u00a0\n\nS: Nomi Y\u00fbji was in charge of the music for Whisper of the Heart and while their efforts were decent. It is actually the absence of sound that often drives this work. From that awkward silence of two characters who have blurted out unreciprocated emotions punctuated by the chirping of the cicadas to the dull hum of the headphones that suggest our main character is lost in her own literary world. It is the banality that allows the story to feel more natural and give further depth to the main characters..\n\nPD: The storyboard artist for this film was Miyazaki Hayao that alone says everything that you need to hear. The sets as they were and the buildings have a life of their own. They are lived in, to the point that you can smell the must wafting off of the books within the Tsukishima's apartment.\n\nBA: The costume design throughout the film is uninspired and at times, feels off. Like in the section where the old man is remembering his time in Germany, and he and seemingly, everyone else appears to be wearing Zoot Suits. The SFX are weak given that this a Studio Ghlibi who is on the verge of producing Princess Mononoke and that the SFX artist is Tanifuji Kaoru who two years prior was running the SFX on the incredibly violent Ninja Scrolls.\n\nEVO: In terms of entertainment Whisper of the Heart is a touching tale that does not rely on the fantastical whimsy that most of Studio Ghibli's films use with astute aplomb. Though this works in the movie's favour. It can give you that sense of a fairy tale within the uncompromising brick walls of reality. That said if you are looking for that other world/Alice in Wonderland feel. I have bad news for you, you may find yourself being forcibly dragged through the intentionally slow pacing.\n\nNotes: I would like to say that I hate some of the promotional posters for this film, they feels\u00a0exploitative as if the marketing team went \"Hey this is a Miyazaki film, and people are going to anticipate wonder and magic.\" The reality is, you should not. This is not that film, this is a measured and slow-paced work that relies on us the viewer building a relationship with the main character. Please do not think this is the perfect film to plop a small child down in front of, it is more for the artsy types who wish to be inspired. Or for a more thoughtful approach to the old follow your dreams cliche. Also, I can see why many people did not watch this film as that trailer was awful and in no way gives you a sense of the world they are building.",

Both had a major plot point that revolved around a girl discovering that a boy had checked out the same books before her from the library. I was lukewarm on that movie, but it had some endearing qualities. That being said, this is a very different film in style. It is focused on young love and what it takes for a person to follow their dreams. I liked that aspect of the story, even if the relationship they form seemed to come out of nowhere, and escalated much too quickly to feel authentic. Following Shizuku on her journey to become a writer was rewarding, and while her flowery prose isn\u2019t exactly my cup of tea, I did still appreciate that it had an enchanting quality to the words. I thought it was odd that Whisper of the Heart dipped its toes into the fantastical for one scene but never got back there. I had anticipated that the entire movie would be magical when we first meet the cat and the statue, but most of the movie is a traditional coming-of-age romantic drama. While sometimes I balk at the mystical elements shown in anime films, this one felt like it needed that something extra. The entire movie was a tad bland and uninteresting to me. I liked the characters, and I wanted to see what would happen to them, but at times I was watching the clock more than the movie waiting for the next significant thing to happen. I can see the charming aspects in Whisper of the Heart, but those charms simply didn\u2019t work all that well on me. But I have had \u201cCountry Roads\u201d stuck in my head for days now.",

They always create this sense of majestic wonder and adventure. The musical score helps elevate that feeling for sure. And the animations and art are always beautiful to look at. The animation of the chunky cat crossing the street was very cute and funny. The grandfather clock scene was beautiful. All the intricate little details within the art. \n\nOh wow. Sugimura actually liked Shizuku the whole time! This creates a problem since Yuko, her best friend, is the one who likes Sugimura. Aww that's sad that Seiji is moving to Italy, and right as him and Shizuku were starting to really like each other. That must be really hard as a kid. The fictional world she created for her story almost looks Beksinski inspired with all the meticulous details in the buildings. The watercolor painted backgrounds and landscapes are gorgeous. \n\nA really nice and charming coming of age movie with some genuinely funny moments sprinkled in. Really wholesome and sweet. This movie has a beautifully nostalgic feel to it, it's definitely cozy. Miyazaki's films always have this enchanting quality to them. I find it very interesting how even though the movie is very light and kid-friendly with it's characters and tone, the movie doesn't stray from venturing into more mature issues like loneliness, depression and loss. It's also a story about first love and destiny, and how imagination can lift us up and take us to incredibly beautiful places, but how it can also tear us apart from the inside as well if we're not careful. Overall it was a very sweet, simple and charming cozy movie that was super easy to watch. Definitely worth the watch, and definitely deserves to be rewatched.",

This movie is originally a comic of the same title written by Aoi Hiiragi and it is the first and the end feature film supervised by Yoshifumi Kondo who is movie director. I watched it many times but I am not tired of it. \n  Shizuku Tsukishima is a girl who is the third grade at a junior high school and is the bookworm. She often go to the library which her father works , but notice the boy's name of \"Seiji Amasawa\" who borrows all the book which herself reads earlier, and reads it. Shizuku did not take time to know that Amasawa Seiji is a classmate, but is intrerested about Amasawa Seiji all the time.\n One day she find a mysterious cat on the way to the library and run after the cat. The cat goes into the small antique shop \"earth shop\", and she meets old man, Shiro Nishi, in a shop. Mr. Nishi is a grandfather of Seiji, and he made a violin in an underground studio. Seiji have a dream to want to study in Italy to become a violin craftsman.\n Shizuku is not understand what should she do in comparison with Seiji having a firm aim. She demands her's dream and begins to write a story. \n It is certain that this movie is love story between Shizuku Tukishima and Seiji Amasawa but another theme of this story is \"growth of Shizuku\". She is troubled about the future and gets over it, and chase the dream is expressed finely.\n What I was drawn into is because I can reflect oneself  through the main characters and the story. The figure of Shizuku who pushes on without escaping from being troubled about the future gives courage to decide at the same time I move very much. And also this music played in this movie is splendid.  The music expresses the complicated feeling of the main characters and sense of the seasons wonderfully. Especially, Because \"country road\" which is the theme song of the movie is music to become the key of the movie, I want you to pay attention by all means.  It is tended to think that this movie is for teenager but even adults enjoy watching it. If you troubled with something and are depressed, I want you to watch this movie. Surely you will positive!",

I've never seen a film that so captured the experience of being a teenager; the innocence, the drama, the dreams, the puppy love, and the frustration of trying to decide what to do with life. It's very relaxed and slow, giving time for Suzuku to develop and for the audience to sympathize with her. It's focus on her desire to become a great writer feels like a love letter to all artists. Many artists feel so torn between the pressures of life, but still strive to keep their dream alive even when those closest to them tell them to stop wasting their time and be like everyone else. I saw a lot of myself in Suzuku. And her discovery that failure likely awaits those that are determined to do what is risky is just melting. If you're not into slow, calm movies, this isn't for you. There aren't any peaks where you say to yourself, \"this is one of the greats\". But for those of you that have the patience, there are plenty of gems to discover.",

Whisper Of The Heart\n\nWhen examining how everyone in the whole world adores this sentimental piece surrounding a 14 year old bookworm struggling to balance her writing passion with maintaining her grades (whilst reluctantly falling in love at the same time), it's difficult to defend this definitive \"worst\" position. For despite reports that this realistic portrayal of young bittersweet romance was exclusively aimed at a female audience, Whisper of the Heart went on to effortlessly seduce all genders regardless of intent, an impressive feat for the first Ghibli to be directed by someone other than Miyazaki or Takahata (note: this was also Kond?'s only Ghibli, as he died of an aneurysm shortly afterwards). But personally ... it underwhelmed me. The plot never seemed to go anywhere, I felt no incentive to invest in the characters (except, of course, for the Baron, but that's a different story...), and it lacked the fantasy elements which I have come to depend on the studio for (which should become even more evident as we go on). That said, perhaps its cute storytelling and safe execution will be your taste exactly (many claim this film as their favourite) but unfortunately it left me with nothing but boredom, resulting in my least favourite Ghibli ever.

No matter; that annoyance drops pretty quickly when your movie is as ingeniously written and executed as \"Whisper\" is. Ghibli films just have this amazing sense of awe in every frame, this fantastic sense of optical voyeurism and splendid life. I haven't seen \"The Wind Rises\" yet (hands down one of my most anticipated of the new year), but one of the promotional stills has maybe the most representative image so far of the sweeping feeling incited by their 2D artwork: a character holding onto his hat against the wind and looking to the sky in admiration, at the idea that anything is possible -- if you dream it, it can come.\n\nWhich segues nicely into talking about \"Whisper of the Heart\", the first Ghibli film to be helmed by someone other than original co-founders Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata (though Miyazaki is responsible for the deeply-felt intimacies of the adapted screenplay.) Expected to be the successor to Miyazaki and Takahata, \"Whisper\" was instead Yoshifumi Kond?'s sole outing as director before his untimely death in 1998 at age 47 of a rare aortic dissection caused reportedly by overwork.\n\nWhich, no less tragic, but what a fittingly bittersweet way to go given \"Whisper's\" central subject matter of artistic struggle and individual passion. Weighty themes for a kids' flick, and even more daunting for one which features a spunky girlhood protagonist. 14-year-old Shizuku (voiced by Brittany Snow in the translation) loves to read and realizes her vice for writing after she meets Seiji (David Gallagher), an older boy who handcrafts violins in the basement of a local antiques shop.\n\nPartially a tale of first love, or at least one's first brushing with the notion of it, \"Whisper of the Heart\" is more so a film about possession, not unlike \"Blue Is the Warmest Color\" or \"Beyond the Hills\" in that regard. Shizuku uses her inspiration to pen a novel based on the fictional history of the shop owner's cat statuette The Baron (Cary Elwes), rushing to finish in time for Seiji's return from an overseas apprenticeship in Italy. During his two month leave, we see Shizuku and her thoughts bloom effervescently, from twee moments of fantasy to recognizing her own merit as a writer comes from the rough edges within. That's what I related to most about \"Whisper of the Heart\", the fear of trying your hardest and best and it still not being good enough. That it blankets a happy hurt with positive soul and venerate lyricism, and sends you out believing the impossible, is all the more amazing. For the honchos at Ghibli, I can't think of a better sentiment. (83/100)",
