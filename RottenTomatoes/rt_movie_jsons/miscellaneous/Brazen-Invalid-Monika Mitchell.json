I was able to guess the final plot right from the start.  My expectations for this movie were already low, but they managed to overcome my disappointment.",

You know you're having fun when you feel nauseated at the thought of having to finish watching. \n\nUnless, of course, you're snowed in. Then those long minutes can quickly find a few hidden treasures to watch. Like this one.  So. 'Let's give it a goo!' in the words of TC's Mike:\n\nI've done my best not to write any spoilers. \n\nSort of an odd thriller - 'criminal minds' type vanity piece delivered via the tried and true 'amateur sleuth hooks up with seasoned detective and stuff happens' formula. \n\nMost egregious in my view was the lack of any backstory or character context for any of the lead players. Some author of questionable talent and supposed success is an absolute authority on police procedural issues as well as interrogation and motive.  She pretty much states as much to the captain and her FWB detective after which she's suddenly got a job! \n\nThere are further issues with the basic conduct of characters deviating from what you'd anticipate based on reality - to the extreme. (e. g romantic element & police detective) \n\nThe world of the film is constrictive and limited. Feels like only a couple dozen people live in this city and their all involved somehow. Such as somehow bumping into various key witnesses on one little walk around the block... Kinda like Trueman Show where everyone's a character and there are no 'ordinaries'. \n\nThere is some weird psuedo-breakage of the third wall when the book the film is based on is also a construct in the film. Idk what the point of that is. It is odd.\n\nIt appears to be trying to appeal to all audiences with elements of romance, action, mystery and thriller - but sadly none are done well and too many tropes and stereotypes left me realising I'd not really seen anything original or meaningful. \n\nThere are some slightly better moments such as some some curveballs to the standard police procedural pro-forma, but sadly these are few and far between. They also don't jive with the rest of it being quite dry and witless and many times end up feeling cynical and ill timed. \n\nThe casting/acting is reasonably good I think which elevates it from 1 to 2 stars.\n\nI'm actually writing this whilst watching the final few moments - a measure of how captivating the film is.\n\nPs. Oh and handwritten notes from florists tend not to be written by the person who ordered them but by the florist themselves.  SML.",

Writing that sentence out loud makes it sound like a piece of sketch comedy, but each scene is delivered in complete monotonic seriousness. The ending is predictable and unbelievably stupid. The writers concoct a ridiculous, out of left-field narrative for the killer, and yet an infant could see the setup from a mile away. The only thing keeping me from rating it a half of a star is how much I laughed at the movie during its duration. There is nothing clever about this film, but if you want a laugh at a terrible movie then you should check this out.",

Yep. Then I saw this and remembered. Tom cruise, yes he believes a drug addict that preached don't so drugs and sold a bunch of people on the idea that aliens attached their soles to ours and we must give his religion all their worldly possessions to be \"free\" but still HES a GREAT actor. She however never was. There was never a question if \"she\" was the boss form the 80s sitcom and it's debatable if she's a real witch after all the crazy she's done and not just from her \"acting\" on the witch show.

Alyssa teams up with the hunky police detective next door to sift through the suspects including her sister's rich entitled ex-husband who is embroiled in a savage custody battle, sister's sullen air pod wearing student whose grades are slipping and the creepy school janitor that knows a little too much about sister's secret life. \n\nSounds juicy right? I mean how do you get this wrong? \n\nUnfortunately it plods along at such a slow pace, that by the time we finally hit the reveal of the killer I had long since lost interest. The ultimate downfall is the lacklustre relationship between Alyssa and the cop-next-door. They do cutesy really well and then straight away get cranky at each other as the investigation intensifies. We never really get any love/hate sexual tension vibes and much as with the killers reveal, the will they/won't they dynamic is more like 'who cares?' \n\nThe absolute highlight of the film is Malachai Weir (who you may recognise from Billions) as the laid back partner of the hunky cop next door. He is the perfect identification point for the audience as he honestly looks like he could give a stuff if the murders gets solved or not. Also keep your eyes peeled here for Alison Araya as Police Cheif who is absolutely hilarious in the new Peacekeeper series. \n\nOh and it goes without saying - they missed a huge opportunity by dressing Alyssa Milano as a Dominatrix and NOT having her ask 'Who's the Boss?'",

            "content": "Nowadays, if a movie is tagged as a \"thriller\", it has to be chock full of gore, violence and foul language. Many times, finding out who the criminal is becomes secondary by how much the film can disgust and horrify the viewer.\n\nNow along comes \"Brazen\". It's a crime drama that adds a little more of the human element to the story in true Nora Roberts fashion. The characters play well off of each other and they're all very believable. As each player is introduced, the storyline gets better and better.\n\nThe movie presents us with relationships, both broken and still-developing. I don't like dropping spoilers in a review, so I'll try and set the stage without doing so. Suffice it to say that we are left guessing through a number of great plot twists and red herrings, My interest was piqued from the opening scene and my pulse rate was definitely sent up and down throughout the whole movie. If you are an Alyssa Milano fan, you know what she's capable of bringing to a project, and this latest film will not disappoint. It's a great movie for a weekend afternoon (or evening), and it's a movie that I was comfortable watching with my whole family.\n\nI think you'll enjoy this as much as I did. It's time well-spent. Enjoy!",
