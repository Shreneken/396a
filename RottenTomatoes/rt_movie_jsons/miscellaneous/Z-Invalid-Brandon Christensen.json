The way the cops come in with guns with the psychiatrist was also beyond absurd. The way Z was eating food and demanding low fat milk - ludicrous. Where does the food go? Surely it would just plop onto the floor! The very fake looking CGI fire was completely unconvincing. The fact that she survives hanging and is not even in hospital - preposterous.  Overall it was quite effective and creepy but the more I think about it the more stupid it seems. Nowhere near as good as \u2018The Babadook' which is an absolute classic and benchmark in horror. This pales in comparison.",

You might find the closing 20 minutes a little jarring as it clumsily steps over smarter ways to end the film, but that doesn't undo the good atmosphere earned earlier.\n\nThe choice to build slowly serves the film well and there are some nice touches. It doesn't really do anything new but it's definitely worth watching for fans of the genre.",

A simple movie, with simple direction, but it truly is an underrated master horror film.",

Mother becomes concerned, starts seeing things and tries to convince the dad to no avail. Then the ghost/demon hurts the dad. They call the family priest/therapist/psychologist. Then things get crazy and the priest/therapist/ psychologist is able to intervene. At the end the ghost/demon is still there. \n\nI've seen so many movies with this exact plot.
