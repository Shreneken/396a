People claim that this movie is a carbon copy of the original. I disagree. Yes it shares alot of similar plot points. But this movie builds on the Highlander universe. We see the use of magic more prominently displayed. Which to me builds up the race of immortals in the minds of the viewers. With the view point that each immortal is different with different skills, abilities and yes even magical powers. This to me mirrors how we see immortals in the Series. For me this movie was an expansion on the lore of the universe which I enjoyed.",

Mario Van Peebles is easily the worst character on screen. He plays a Kurgan wanna be. He's a magician and bad one at that. For all the fans of Mako Iwamatsu, he makes a role in this film but much like the rest of the acting, you'll be disappointed. The special effects are mediocre to acceptable.

And despite a sizeable budget, it just looked so cheap. Also, Highlander III: Final Dimension involves a complicated background story to Connor MacLeod about his exploits in France, and this actually has no relevance to the story and does nothing for any character, so it's just a pointless time-filling aspect of the film's running time.\nAnd another problem is that Highlander III: Final Dimension is devoid of the fun of the original Highlander, because it just takes itself too seriously and doesn't embody the tone that made the original so awesome, and it attempts to re-establish that towards the end of the film but by that point the damage has been done.\nThe only good thing about Highlander III: Final Dimension is that since it ignores the plot of Highlander II: The Quickening, it's safe to assume that we can all pretend it never existed. It does also feature some good cinematography moments and has an ok musical score. \nBut nevertheless, Highlander III: Final Dimension was unimpressive and only really drew any strength from Christopher Lambert's performance which was weaker than before, but still somewhat good for the character.\nMario Van Peebles however decides to poorly overemphasize every word with a cheap Batman voice.\nSo Highlander III: Final Dimension is a poor looking film, but is milestones ahead of it's horrible predecessor and is more likely to provide enjoyment for fans of the franchise, yet still it's unlikely to provide much.",

It really is irritating to me how they totally screwed up the sequels and in my opinion they should have just stuck with the original 1st Highlander and left it at that.

Then the nonsense inevitably begins as a statue inexplicably turns its head and opens its eyes, we cut to the present then back to 18th century France for some reason, we're given an odd, super long gratuitous sex scene and the list goes on.\n\nThat said, the film at the very least acknowledges the shortcomings of its predecessor as it doesn't even attempt to fix anything and just never mentions it.

Basically the movie just ignores the second one and attempts to become the true sequel. I say attempts because it sucks, and to me it will never be a sequel.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the movie is a complete rip-off of Conan The Barbarian that it makes Terminators cry. It even has Mako in the film. \r\n\r\nConnor is trainig with Mako when Kane shows up. Mako has the ability to create illusions, giving him an edge over other Immortals. This doesn't stop Kane from taking his head as the cave collapses. Flash to present day and Connor hasn't won the Prize (though he thinks he has). Kane finally gets released fro munderground, and speaks perfect English. It's all pretty weak but hey, at least we don't have any aliens. OH GOD HIGHLANDER 2 FLASHBACK!\r\n\r\nThe worst problem about the movie is that it could have been better. It certainly couldn't have been worse. They just chose to copy the script from the first movie and remove all the cool aspects. I mean the illusion thing could have been a cool anomaly within the Immortals and the story could have been interesting but they put 0 work into it. At least Highlander 2 might be good if you were on acid. At least they put somethin into it that was different (even though it was the worst ideas ever). Highlander: The Final Dimension is still better though.\r\n\r\nThe film ends with a battle in an old factory (where action films go to die), and on a side note, I think Connor needs to thank the makers of pipes. You'd understand if you had seen......OH GOD HIGHLANDER 2 FLASHBACK!\r\n\r\nConnor also has an adopted son in the movie who is kind of annoying. Of course there is also a love intrest because Scotsmen are total players! Apparently she is supposed to be a lot like a love that Conner once had...lame! Who cares anyway? Love intrests are usually just standard anyway.\r\n\r\nKane is kind of fun to watch because the performance is just so over the top. I mean he must have set a record for saying \"There can be only one\" in a film. His voice sounds like he moonlights as Dr. Claw, but I digress.\r\n\r\nThe Final Dimension? Yeah right. I think the series needs a real boost. Not a remake, just a good god damn movie. Fans deserve it, I can think of few other fanbases who have had to put up with this crap.",

He even manages to keep his tongue in his mouth most of the time.  The beginning of the movie confuses me. Apparently the villain was just burried in a cave in.  Don't know why Conner got the quickening since he wasn't the last one.  Anyway the big uniqueness in this movie is that the villain had killed an immortal who was a sorceress, so there's tons of magic in this one.  As for the title, it seems incredibly stupid. I don't see at all where 'final dimension' comes in. I guess the only new information revealed in this movie is that if you do try to kill someone on holy ground, windows will shatter and scare you away.
