            "content": "On an island full of mutated animal hybrids, it's former sex symbol Marlon Brando covered in sunscreen that looks the grossest. \n\nI was actually reminded to watch this thanks to the Val documentary, and that's not without good reason - the story of the production of this film is more interesting than the film itself. It's a notorious trainwreck of a movie, with its original director fired mid-production, miserable on-location shooting, titanic egos crashing into one another, and a pervasive sense of confusion haunting the entire project, which was substantial enough to filter through to the audiences in the theatre. Thanks to Brando's forceful personality and Frankenheimer's desire to make the film his own once he took it over, there were apparently constant rewrites, and both Brando and Kilmer just seemed to do whatever they wanted on set, including while the camera was rolling. Brando had an ice bucket hat that his character likes to use to cool down, and Kilmer pops up with a computer chip on his head at one point. The movie is so strange that it wraps back around to having value, with iconic actors apparently deliberately sabotaging the production in ways you won't see anywhere else. Still underwhelming and certainly a bad film with erratic themes, but it's bad in unusual ways that make it worth watching just to understand.\n\nThe only person that brought their unironic A-game to this movie was iconic makeup/special effects designer Stan Winston; the animation is dodgy as hell but the facial prosthetics are legitimately good. (1.5/5)",

            "content": "In 2010, United Nations negotiator Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) survives a plane crash in the Java Sea and is eventually rescued by a passing boat. Aboard, a man called Montgomery (Val Kilmer) tends to him. After telling him the boat has no radio, he promises Douglas the captain will take him to Timor after dropping him off. However, when they arrive at Montgomery's destination referred to as \"Moreau's Island\", he instead advises Douglas to stay with him, ostensibly so he can use the radio on the island. Montgomery unloads a shipment of rabbits at a pen, and one runs away while he slaughters another for Douglas's meal. They then head on to the Main House where Douglas is warned not to wander. There, he meets a daughter of Dr. Moreau's called Aissa (Fairuza Balk), but Montgomery turns him away from her and leads him to his room. On the way, they discuss how Moreau vanished after becoming obsessed with his animal research. Montgomery locks Douglas in his room, but he manages to escape that night. He then comes across the camp's lab where he witnesses the birth of a mutant baby, belonging to and delivered by human-animal hybrids. He is noticed, escapes, and runs into Aissa who leads him to the village of the mutants. On the way, they find the partially eaten corpse of a rabbit, not far from a leopard hybrid called Lo-Mai (Mark Dacascos). At the village, they find the Sayer of the Law (Ron Perlman) whose Law preaches \"being human\" in terms of restraint and discipline. Dr. Moreau (Marlon Brando), referred to as \"The Father\" by the mutants, appears. He controls the villagers by using a remote control that causes pain through an implant under the creatures' skin. Moreau forces the village to hand over Douglas only to peacefully take him to the House to discuss the situation. Douglas, Montgomery and Moreau gather and he introduces his hybrid \"children\" and later dine. Then, he explains his creations: he fused animals with human genes in search of a higher being, incapable of harm. The existing Beast Folk are imperfect, but Moreau claims to be \"closer than [Douglas] could possibly imagine\" in his quest. Moreau's \"son\" Azazello (Temuera Morrison) comes in with the rabbit, to the disgust of Moreau, who abhors killing. When he learns of the eaten rabbit, he promises that there will be a trial the next day. Douglas tries to escape by boat, but finds it overrun with rat-like creatures and gives up...\n\nThe film was met with negative reviews. The film grossed only $49 million worldwide on a $40 million budget, which, with marketing and other expenses, lost money for the studio. In an article written upon Brando's death in 2004, critic Roger Ebert described The Island of Dr. Moreau as \"perhaps [Brando's] worst film\". The Island of Dr. Moreau later received six nominations for the Razzie Awards including Worst Picture and Worst Director, winning Worst Supporting Actor for Marlon Brando (Val Kilmer was also a nominee in this category). At the 1996 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, Brando was nominated for Worst On-Screen Hairstyle (which he lost to Stephen Baldwin for Bio-Dome) and won Worst Supporting Actor. The film also got nominations for two Saturn Awards: Best Science Fiction Film and Best Make-up.\n\n\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" is not as bad as it has been pointed out to be, but the film had a bit of a messy production which is however not extremely evident in my opinion. The production was notoriously difficult, marred by issues with the cast, harsh weather, and a skyrocketing budget. Bruce Willis was originally hired to play Edward Douglas, but allegedly dropped out as he started divorce procedures from Demi Moore, his wife at the time. Willis was replaced by Val Kilmer, who made his availability limited, and later had anger issues with most of the cast after also being served divorce papers on set. Then actor Rob Morrow quit because of script rewrites. Also, Marlon Brando's role as Dr. Moreau was supposed to be expanded, but after his daughter, Cheyenne, committed suicide, he retreated to his private island, leaving the film production in limbo, not knowing when or even if he would show up. Brando also didn't want to learn his lines, so he requested them through an earpiece. Finally, original director Richard Stanley was dismissed by New Line Cinema after problems arose during production, with John Frankenheimer being brought in to replace him. The film received generally negative reviews and was considered a box office bomb. H.G Wells story is still for sure horrifying and very very current today. \n\nTrivia: In 2014, the documentary Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau was released. It covers Richard Stanley's experiences while he conceived and developed the project, his time as director of the film and the aftermath of his departure and the effect it had on the cast and crew and overall film.\nRichard Stanley's original screenplay was much darker, sexier and violent. The ending, where the animals take over the island, was far more apocalyptic and downbeat.",

The start isn't so bad, but quickly the onset difficulties begin to emerge, and any semblance of a sensical story or narrative coherence are thrown out the window, and the film devolves into a complete cluster of insanity and nonsense. Surprisingly, Marlon Brando, who at this point was beyond not giving a damn when it came to acting, is actually not as bad as I thought he would be. Playing a mad scientist while doing what seems to be an impersonation of the late Ken Dodd, he's not given anything interesting to do or say, but he at least looks like he's giving it a go. David Thewlis is entirely wasted on a part that requires him to be almost exclusively an observer rather than a participant, and his involvement as a character is completely inconsequential. Val Kilmer, allegedly the most troublesome on set presence, is also passive and unengaging. It's a dream project ruined by circumstances both tragic and selfish, and serves as a warning to Directors that too many overpaid, temperamental cooks spitting in the broth can only result in disaster.",

This is some of his best comical work, consistent every step of the way, more articulate defined beats than some of his lazier comedies like The Freshman.  When he finally loses control, and we see him flustered, it reads so clearly and unexpectedly - how could a man like this ever reach this point?  However, it is just like Brando, who makes himself so exclusive, to keep his role down to a minimum second act only performance.  And we are truly at a loss without the Father as the film wanes on.  \n\nI love Kilmer's Brando impersonation amongst purple/green sci-fi light.  His entrance to the creatures this way amidst lightning, descending down the elevator, surrounded by their desperation, is classic.\n\nI love the evolution of David Thwelis in this film, he's such a storyteller, where he brings Douglas from a straight-laced guy looking to get home, devolved into a gun-wielding crazy man totally absorbed in the business of this god-forsaken island he never asked to be a part of; there's savagery growing in him.\n\nWith 20 minutes to go, Kilmer and Brando are both gone, the creatures are taking over, Kilmer has said that everything has failed before dying.  It's an escape film, a survivor story from here.  Forget about regaining control, it's time to get out of here... or join them?  What's to become of Douglas and Moreau's daughter, who is changing into another form?  \n\nWhat a treasure that this film exists, it almost feels as lost as the island Moreau himself inhabits.",

            "content": "Panned as a product of abhorrent filmmaking, The Island of Dr. Moreau sounded like a potentially entertaining terrible film.\n\nBased on a screenplay penned by Richard Stanley and Ron Hutchinson, The Island of Dr. Moreau originally had the former on board as the director. But like the many actors who left the production shortly before filming began and Rob Morrow who left after a day, Richard Stanley ultimately departed his duties having disappeared to cope with a mental breakdown. He left a week into principal photography due to the self-obsessive on-set antics of Val Kilmer who made the production hell for everybody. So The Island of Dr. Moreau was doomed before it began, a broken production left for John Frankenheimer to piece together. It doesn't take long before viewers can conclude that he was no saviour, largely because the production is beyond rescue.\nThere isn't much of a great mystery behind the titular Dr. Moreau. It's mentioned in passing that he disappeared and was presumed dead, but the actors seem hardly interested in this. The characters aren't that interesting in the first place as characterization takes a back seat to spectacle, and so the script is left to be oversimplified with rare references to any profound themes of intellect.The concept of a mad scientists attempting to convert animals into people has good potential for science fiction and thrills with even ethical concepts paving the way for potential drama. Instead, The Island of Dr. Moreau takes its concept and churns out a half-assed drama about general life on the island and the way it is run without any insight into profound themes. There is no telling what Richard Stanley might have done with the story, but John Frankenheimer has proven on many occasions that he is a visual artists first and a storyteller second. Bringing him in last-minute to a hellish production with faulty special effects puts his testicles straight into a bear trap, and the limitations imposed on him results in meandering elements of visual grace and a story with no social commentary whatsoever.\nVisually, the scenery in The Island of Dr. Moreau is marvellous. With Richaerd Stanley's keen eye for imagery, the cinematography works to capture the beauty of the Australian scenery with gracefully moving wide-screen cinematography. There is a lot of colourful life the surrounds the story in The Island of Dr. Moreau. Alas, the grace of the locations is blunted by the creatures that inhabit them. The creatures in The Island of Dr. Moreau are supposedly human-animal hybrids, but they instead look like burn victims with pubic hair taped to their face. Seemingly an inspiration for the incredibly awkward design of the Psychlos from the catastrophic science fiction box office bomb Battlefield Earth (2000), there is nothing impressive about the makeup work in The Island of Dr. Moreau. I am reminded of a scene in the action-comedy satire Team America: World Police (2004) where a facial reconstruction of one of the puppets is undertaken with the result being little more than paint and hair being stuck on his face as part of the joke. As if Academy Award-winning makeup artist Stan Winston is playing a joke on audiences, the creatures from The Island of Dr. Moreau are of little more convincement than the actors in gorilla suits from Congo (1995) the previous year. The makeup effects in the low-budget horror film The Howling (1981) were superior, even though that film preceded The Island of Dr. Moreau by 15 years and cost a meagre $1.5 million. Viewers will get so caught up in the incomprehensible ugliness of the creatures in The Island of Dr. Moreau that they may forget about the overtly shallow nature of the story, but it drags the credibility of the production out the door and leaves it with no chance of achieving an intense mood that it may desire. Frankly, the greatest mark The Island of Dr. Moreau made on history was inspiring the creation of the South Park (1997-present) characters Dr. Alphonse Mephesto and Kevin.\nThe one aspect I will give consistent credit to is the musical score. Though the film has no hope of achieving intensity, the work of Gary Chang manages to combine elements of the jungle setting and simple thriller elements. It's not transcendent, but amid the countless flaws in The Island of Dr. Moreau it is the one thing I would call good. When considering the music and the sound effects, I would almost conclude that The Island of Dr. Moreau is better on the ears than the eyes if not for the weak dialogue and lacklustre cast responsible for delivering it.\nMarlon Brando and Val Kilmer battle for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor in The Island of Dr. Moreau. Both deliver poor performances, but it ultimately goes home with the more deserved of the two, Marlon Brando. The films made by Marlon Brando during his post-The Godfather (1972) proved mostly to be glorified cameos and supporting roles intended to bring him more money than credibility. The Island of Dr. Moreau is of course no exception to this since he doesn't bear his face until 30 minutes into the film. Returning to the role of an insane Jungle man after playing such a part to iconic results in Apocalypse Now (1979), the two roles beg for comparisons. Yet while Colonel Walter E. Kurtz was a psychotic genius buried beneath shadow, Dr. Moreau is an overweight bumbling fool with more of a pretentious nature than an insane one. When he goes into his monologue about his passion for animal experimentation, all I could hear was the voice of Ian McDiarmid telling me the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise as he did in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). The two-time Academy Award winner is little more than an overweight bumbling fool in The Island of Dr. Moreau, a role that could be called the absolute worst of his career. Anyone looking at this film without a knowledge of Marlon Brando's prior history would never have guessed that he is considered a screen legend.\nVal Kilmer's casting in The Island of Dr. Moreau was as a last-minute replacement for James Woods. While the character Dr. Montgomery is hardly interesting in the first place, the intrinsic nature of James Woods could have been enough of a gimmick to add mild entertainment to The Island of Dr. Moreau. Val Kilmer has none of that, he is simply a decent actor in the right role. However, Dr. Montgomery is not the right role. Val Kilmer has few iconic traits about him, and in The Island of Dr. Moreau he has to rely on them to carry the lifeless role that he made the entire production hell in an effort to play. It's odd that nobody saw fit to fire the man when his behaviour was so outlandish or even when his performance was so poor, but I guess the entire production was in too deep by this point. The fact is that Val Kilmer has no feeling of dramatic charisma or psychosis in The Island of Dr. Moreau and gave Richard Stanley a mental breakdown for nothing.\nDavid Thewlis also fails to make an impact. Though he is the protagonist, Edward Douglas is reduced to being a forgettable supporting character who spends the entirety of the film looking at the surrounding world with the same confusion as viewers. In that sense he is the most sympathetic character of the film, but he is still generic. David Thewlis has little to say so there is nothing pretentious or potentially dislikeable about him, he is simply a shell of a character pushed through a series of meaningless plot dynamics so that the film can pretend it has a protagonist. It's simple a waste of his time.\nThe first thing Fairuza Balk is seen doing in The Island of Dr. Moreau is dancing around awkwardly to repetitive music in an attempt to capture some kind of mystique, but there is nothing there. She seems as confused by everything as David Thewlis, and though she has her own dramatic subplot it is never truly realized. There are moments of meandering flair where you can see she is trying, but everything around her works to destroy her talents. It is a true shame since she was a talented star of the 90's decade having played such roles as the gothic antagonist Nancy Downs in The Craft (1996) during the same year. She's the one cast member who is really any good.\nLastly, The fact that Ron Perlman is one of the many actors beneath the pathetic makeup is incredibly insulting to the man's credit as an actor. Having played the role of Vincent the titular Beast on Beauty and the Beast (1987-1990) and winning a Golden Globe in the process, the man his revealed his natural talents for acting as an anthropomorphic creature beneath good makeup effects. Since The Island of Dr. Moreau has none of those but still puts him in such a role, he is condemned to be one of the many poorly designed creatures and cannot push his charisma beyond it. He isn't given much time to try anyway, and the script doesn't care enough to help him.\n\n\nThe Island of Dr. Moreau has an interesting idea at heart and some nice scenery, but with the production of the film being a ticking time bomb, it explodes into a lifelessly slow collection of meaningless incomprehensible drama, poor prosthetics and a distinct lack of thrills",

The main problem I had is that it doesn't  flow in an organic sort of way and even though Val Kilmer did well enough pulling off a really bizarre impersonation of the \"father\" his descent into madness is like whiplash.  One moment he's a law enforcement officer of sorts and the next he's all crazy pants with no real explanation.  I also don't understand the \"old and wise\" goat man character. I'm assuming he must be a parody of preachers testifying about the Lord and the \"father\" is his God but he's just too out of place among the other characters and is overly contrived to get a point across when he's not necessary in the story at all.  The other characters get the point across just fine without him.  Despite all of that and more I didn't mention this movie is still somehow fascinating and has a haunting quality to it that gets under the skin. I think part of it comes from the concept of the \"perfect creature\" being a cat woman.  She is indirectly portrayed as a black cat woman (no explanation of that needed) mixed with the Stones \"Under my Thumb\".  I can't be the first person to point that out.",

But there are times when the little cloud spreads, until it obscures the sky. And those times I look around at my fellow men and I am reminded of some likeness of the beast-people, and I feel as though the animal is surging up in them. And I know they are neither wholly animal nor wholly man, but an unstable combination of both. As unstable as anything Moreau created. And I go... in fear. \n\nThis movie was kind of cheesy but I think I can attribute it mostly to the fact that the technology and CG effects weren't at the stage where this movie needed it to be to be taken seriously. If any film could benefit from a reboot, this would be a good candidate. Don't get me wrong, I mean, the source material is profound but a credible CG department would have made this film vastly different. Granted, the talented cast were a bit disappointing too. I mean you've Brandon who the Godfather of acting (pun intended). David Thewlis who is one of the most brilliant and underrated British actors (IMHO). Kilmer (who did a wickedly dead-on Brando was super creepy), Balk and Pearlman who are very capable actors in their own right, it's just seemed like they were purposely directed to \"ham it up\" or just act uncharacteristically strange. The more eccentric the better it seems and c'mon no one can out eccentric Brando, let's face it. Other than that, the film lack fluidity, which was strange for a movie whose locale barely changed, every scene looked so choppy and slapped together. Once again, poor direction, poor editing. All I can say, this film could have been done so much better and it's such a shame to see so many talented actor's potentials wasted on a promising project.",

A dark beauty named Aissa (Fairuza Balk), a giant, white, soft-spoken psychopath known as Moreau (Marlon Brando), and a variety of half-man/half-creature mutations running around are enough to inform the viewer that they're not in Kansas anymore. \n\nLacking in substantial character development, or a coherent plot, it's easy to understand why The Island of Dr Moreau received - and continues to receive - such harsh criticism. I got the vague impression that there was a grand statement about religion and human nature buried under the perpetual surface ripples. However, it never manifested itself completely. Either way, I still found myself enjoying this film because of how utterly insane it was.

I missed how Montgomery died though, it all gets a bit out of hand and I think he gets shot.\n\nGiven the fact I kinda liked this it's not really a great film by any means, a good idea but poorly directed and fairly poor make up to boot.",

I am very sorry to say, that this movie does not not provoke that question. You just see wasted potential, Brando seems to play a parody character of his \"Apocalypse Now\" character of col. Kurtz.  Both he and Kilmer are mostly ignored throughout the movie. The film leaves many questions to be answered as it rushes through the story, making the viewer sometimes oblivious of what is going on. The film has no real focus on anything and at the end of the movie you really don't know what it was about because, honestly, you just don't care.\nThe only thing worth praising in this film is Stan Winston's creations which seem to have been as revolutionary as \"Planet of the Apes\" in its day.",

On the one hand, if we're to judge the movie based on what it was TRYING to do (namely, it was meant to be a thrilling, mind-blowing action/horror hybrid that dealt with heavy philosophical issues while giving its Hollywood talent something meaty to sink their chops into), then 'Moreau' isn't just a bad movie - it's a train wreck of awe-inspiring proportions. If, on the other hand, we judge the movie based on its ability to generate massive amounts of unintended laughter and schadenfreude, then it's something of a surrealist 'how not to do it' masterpiece. Just try to hold back the tears when Brando cools his over-heated mad-genius brain with an ice bucket, or when Kilmer (looking so contemptuous of the movie he's in that he's ready to spit) decks himself out in pasty white messiah makeup and declares his desire to go to 'dog heaven'. Ultimately the last laugh has to go to original director Richard Stanley, who was fired early on from this, his dream project, and quickly replaced with John Frankenheimer because the studio didn't like his take on the material. No way to know now what Stanley's 'Moreau' might have been like, but it's hard to believe it would have been as misguided, hysterical and just plain crazy as this one.",

And apart from the initially impressive cast (Marlon Brando, Val Kilmer, David Thewlis, Ron Perlman) and the director of note John Frankenheimer (who is my opinion hasn't made a good film since both 'The Manchurian Candidate' and 'Birdman of Alcatraz' in 1962) the film is noteworthy only for the scale of its blandness, and the incomprehensiibly inept execution of the film's story and symbolism.\r\n\r\nWhether this is one of the occasions where we will forever wonder what type of monster original director Richard Stanley (another great definition of the word 'disappointing) would have created of his dream project, had  he not been fired a mere four days into the shoot, we'll never know - but what is clear is that the film which Frankenheimer brought to the screens is an infuriatingly wasted attempt, and a constant wonder to me at how such a promising project, coupled with such a talented cast, could have fallen so badly into the pits of cinematic retardedness.\r\n\r\nSurely, even if the film was handed to an incompetent director (which Stanley was not), and he had been given total creative freedom to make any film he desired, the results would have been better than this bland, mixed, always promising, yet repeatedly dumbfoundingly boring waste of opportunity. It seems that the only person who was delivering a memorable performance (whether he was aware of it or not) is Brando, whose blissfully ignorant character, swathed in robes to protect his skin remains the films sole lasting image.\r\n\r\nImagine if the studio had given their complete confidence to a director, then sat back and allowed him to create a terrifying, layered, bizarre, nuanced and relevant work with the actors. We would still be hailing the movie as a masterpiece. A film whose grasp even exceeds its reach. An 'Apocalypse Now' of science and nature, if you will.\r\n\r\nWhat we are forced to watch however, is an intriguing start, which decends irretrievably into a confused mess of cliche and farce. And that fact that it's still barely watchable just adds to the frustration of what COULD have been.\r\n\r\nThe only true success of note here, is the consistantly great work of the late Stan Winston.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116654/trivia",
