Just watch this movie before your next interview. Kangana Ranaut is so naturally simple!!! And each and every actor has acted superbly irrespective of the screen time. Ladies, please do a favor to urself and watch this gem of a movie.\n\nMy fav scenes:\n- Of course the dance in the pub\n- In the beginning of the movie, boy dumps the girl in a restaurant. Similar scene in the climax, but with the roles reversed\n- The level of detailing is too good. Notice how the mehendi on Kangana's hands is faded in the climax scenes. Brilliant\n- When Kangana is in an awkward situation, her male friend comes and asks HER, do u need help... does not automatically assume that she needs help. Fantastic!\n- The Pani poori scene and the Emraan Hashmi reference.\n- The end credits showing Kangana's trip as Facebook timeline. How logical!\n\n-ve points:\n- Some scenes are intelligently inspired from English Vinglish\n- The hero's reason for dumpling is not convincing enough\n\nMy rating:\nStory - 0.5 - nothing new\nScreenplay - 1 (The arc of Kangana's transformation is so smooth)\nActing - 1 (Even the kid brother has acted well)\nOther departments - 0.5 (I expected more from Amit Trivedi specially since he sets such a high bar for himself after English Vinglish and Lootera)\nOverall Package - 1\n\nTotal - 4/5",

            "content": "I can't believe I saw a Bollywood movie that lasted over 140 minutes and there was not one song and dance number.  Really, not one.  The beginning, when the family is celebrating Rani's impending wedding, does not count as it is a family partying.  It's not meant to move the story forward in any way.  It must take a great amount of self-restraint.  I think that's where the positives end to be honest.  Then again, there's like 10+ music montage scenes here, so that's an adequate substitute.  This movie is definitely well-intentioned, seeing the story of a simple woman who, upon being dumped by her fiancee, decides to go on her honeymoon by herself, wherein she discovers her zest for life.  It's as corny as it sounds and it's just, honestly, not a very good movie.  It's more like a series of sketches where Rani gets herself into silly situations, a typical fish-out-of-water concept, and how her very conservative upbringing makes her react when she sees the lifestyle some the friends she meets on her journey lead.  I will say one thing, and I guess this is a positive, and that is that the lead of this film, Kangana Ranaut, is immensely likable.  I'd say that the Rani character is a bit of a muppet, but I think Kangana does a decent enough job at not letting the character become someone you pity.  The story is, essentially, nonexistent.  It's all about Rani liberating herself and becoming a new woman.  That's all fine and good.  But the movie is, as I mentioned, slightly over 140 minutes long.  You need a lot more than Rani just having a good time with people she meets in Paris or Amsterdam.  That's what the movie boils down to.  It's all Rani having a good time.  And that's fine if you're a real person wanting to just have a blast to forget a particularly nasty breakup.  It's not so necessarily fine when you're in a fictional movie that's super fucking long.  You need far more content than the film was willing to provide here.  They were hoping that Kangana being so charming and likable would go a longer way than it ended up going.  One thing I will say that's a positive, and that's not even anything having to do with the film, is that I think this movie has one of the most stunningly beautiful women I've seen in a long time.  Lisa Haydon plays Vijay, the person she meets in Paris and becomes friends with.  Let's just get this out of the way, she was a terrible actress.  She was just horrendous.  But she was quite gorgeous.  And it's not like it hit you all at once how gorgeous she actually was.  She got more and more beautiful the more you kept seeing her.  It was something else.  While her character was a little bit wild and out there, and as mentioned, she was terrible, but there's a certain something about the way she carries herself.  She's got some great presence.  Your eyes are immediately drawn to her no matter what scene she is in.  She, quite frankly, overshadows Rani.  Smartly enough, Rani leaves Paris to go to Amsterdam, so the female Vijay couldn't overshadow her anymore.  Honestly, once Rani finds herself in Amsterdam, this is when the movie hits its \"stride\".  There's some cute stuff there with Rani, staying at a hostel with 3 men, and how her conservative upbringing has made her weary of this situation and how her family would react.  It's not good, but at least it's something.  And, at the very least, Rani isn't overshadowed by her three roommates.  Of course, Rani builds somewhat of an unbreakable bond with her three roommates in five days.  It feels a little too quick to me, but that's how the movie presented it.  There's also not much to the stuff in Amsterdam honestly.  It's more of the same, Rani having a good time with her friends, smiling a lot and actually having us pretend that that's good storytelling.  Look, this movie looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot.  It must have been like a vacation for the majority of the actors, they have minimal stuff to do if you really think about it.  It's an easy, breezy, light-comedy.  Ok, but just because the characters are having fun does not mean that we are as well.  I guess seeing the reaction among flixster users, at least scoring-wise, as there's one negative review, means that most people did enjoy it.  I just don't see it to be honest.  The film gives off the appearance of being fun and enjoyable.  But that's all it is, an illusion.  And it's a sweet film in parts, like I honestly believe the film meant well, but good intentions can only take you so far.  I wouldn't say it's bad, I'd just say that there should've been more effort to tell a good story instead of relying, mostly, on stereotypical cliches.  Kangana Ranaut is fine and Lisa Haydon is gorgeous, but there's nothing of substance to this film.",

And shockingly she got betrayed from her fiancee who canceled their weeding. But with the help of strangers from totally another countries who became her new friends in addition from the help of her free self in other words without being protected all the time from the close ones,she changed to a whole new other person who is independent, strong, open-minded and courage women, because in my opinion she finally knew that she doesn't need anyone to feel happy and not being protected caused her a new experiences and new lovely people... a whole new life, also she finally tried new things. So i can sum up all this by saying she explored the world within herself.\n\nSo if anyone ever ask someone which character in a any film would you be? I know that most of the girls would pick the beautiful character with the perfect body and the perfect boyfriend but if they ask me i would pick queen because i want to be the girl she turned out to be: a beautiful, confident, open minded, courage girl satisfied with own self.\n\nThanks again Vikas Bahl.",

            "content": "Queen showcases Kangana Ranaut's spectacular and terrific performance. A movie with less words, and zero melodrama. The movie begins with the loud Punjabi Wedding - mehandi, sangeet celebrations of Rani aka Queen (played by Kangana Ranaut). It is great to see Rani's self-talk as a bride-in-making about lot many things viz. her friend ought to be dancing in her mehandi, young kid brother Chintu ought to be taking photographs of her on her mobile etc. Devastated by the last minute 'call off' of the relationship by her fiancée London-returned Vijay Dhingra (Rajkummar Rao), she decides to fly (with her family' support) for her pre-planned honeymoon all alone to Paris and Amsterdam. Here Rani starts her voyage of self-discovery, a girl from Rajouri Garden of Delhi, over protective daughter of a Mithaiwala (businessman) to a foreign land absolutely on her own. It is really wonderful to see Rani emerge from her turmoil.\nDirector Vikas Bahl has done a great job by weaving a very ordinary theme into a great story of triumph of an ordinary girl, regaining her self-esteem, and relooking at life from a very different perspective. Vikas is not at all judgmental in projecting the east and west lifestyles.  \nLisa Haydon as Vijayalakshmi (called as Vijay), a Hotel staff in Paris and French-Indian single mom, who turned to be a good friend of Rani has done full justice to her role. Vikas Bahl has thoughtfully crafted two 'Vijay' in the movie, one by Rajkummar Rao and another by Lisa Haydon, one responsible for the 'miseries' (can we say so...?) in Rani's life, and another showing her a different path to her independent and self-worthy life.\nFrom Paris, Rani goes to Amsterdam where she gets the company of multi-cultural trio: White, Black and Asian. Certain scenes are just hilarious. Rani is absolutely shown on her way to learn freedom, friendship, togetherness, yet skyping with her family in India ten times a day.  \nThe cast of Rani's family- her parents, dadi and brother are all very good. Rajkummar Rao as Vijay has given a great performance as a regular obnoxious boy who wants a girl (who should not be working, yet modern in looks) within his framework. He excels in almost all the frames: in his efforts to persuade Rani for his love, then rejecting her, and also as the one who wants to win back the girl and her love when he finds that she has started fitting into his so-called 'parameters'. \nThe beauty of the film is all about the gradual unexaggerated transformation of Rani along with the fading of Mehandi on her hands into a confident self-assured girl. Rani tells us that is it necessary to be victim to someone else's deeds, someone else's rejection ? There is a beautiful scene in the movie that soon after cancellation of the marriage and crying for almost the whole night, she gets up and eats the same Shaadi ke Laddu which was kept in her room.\nYes, the Queen completely belongs to Kangana, her silent, yet great facial expressions, her innocence, her carrying off kurtis to beautiful stylish costumes. Absolutely natural look is given to her. \nMusic by Amit Trivedi is doing good in chartbusters. Paris and Amsterdam have been captured nicely by the cinematographer.\n\nWatch Queen, she is going to be the queen of your heart.",

            "content": "With hopes of a big celebration, Rani's preparations involve the London thumka and a complete emotional and mental surrender to the dream of an ideal wedding. Her world is shattered by her fiance who chickened out of the wedding on grounds that Rani didn't evolve to his now foreign lifestyle. The distraught and heart-broken Rani comes out from a brief self imprisonment to her concerned family and seeks permission to escape to Europe on her own for a solitary honeymoon and to find solace from the anguish. \n\n\tThe Hungama begins in Paris as she struggles independently in a foreign land. The despondent Rani who cannot cross the street, order normal food or even find peace in the city of lovers, meets Vijayalaxmi (Lisa Hayden) who is the antithesis of a conservative Indian girl. This scantily clad hotel housekeeper gradually exposes Rani to a free spirited living where every moment is fun-filled and made of carefree choices. Rani enjoys the company of her new friend and is almost past her failed engagement when her next move takes her to Amsterdam in a hostel room shared with 3 guys. The initial hesitation and fear is soon converted to a genuine bond of friendship as these roommates have fun around town. Language is a bit of an issue especially with Rani but she knows how to take a joke on herself. This uncanny ability turns even the most awkward moment into a laughable memory. \nIn the company of such unusual, warm, funny and trust-worthy friends, Rani lets go of the inhibitions she was brought up with and discovered freedom that had no strings attached. The resulting confidence was a handy weapon to use when she was suddenly confronted by her now apologetic betrayer, Vijay. Rani has found her true self in the company of these strangers in a foreign land while on the other hand, an opportunity to fix the ignominy of a failed wedding ceremony rests before her. She doesn't have to follow the conventional norms anymore. With her freedom comes the right to make her own decisions and she shall be the Queen of her own fate. \n\n\tWith the charming 'Chillar Party', Vikas Bahl portrayed his penchant for feel-good comedies. Queen isn't really challenging society's norms but it is proving yet again that society doesn't have the right to dictate the path for an individual. Within an open environment, a person can find their path and face challenges with renewed confidence. Rani is the embodiment of a simpleton's free-spirited nature and while she violates Guptaji's principles, she doesn't cease to entertain in this journey of self-discovery. Kangana Ranaut's exemplary performance is owed to her ability to naturally become Rani. Her ability to laugh at herself no matter how awkward the situation, is a particularly striking attribute that makes her so loveable. Kangana excels in some scenes where the simpleton Rani emotes naturally. With a few drinks on a night out, Rani helplessly bursts into tears and whines about her life 'itna kharab ho gaya' and soon she erupts on the dance floor to rock to Hungama hogaya and goes wild on the streets. She is deeply rooted to her conservative culture but does not mind trying some of Vijayalaxmi's open and free ways. Rani grows out of the broken relationship and by the time she mingles with her roommates in Amsterdam, she is a fun-loving, carefree individual who has found her peace among friends. This transition is handled by Kangana with a naturally subtle performance. The roommates Tim, Taka and Olexander are also fine actors with a keen ability to portray their characters in a natural manner. Taka is so full of energy while Olexander provides an understanding of Rani's traits and becomes a support for her. The rest of the supporting cast including Rajkumar Rao as Vijay and Rani's parents have provided sincere performances to suit the mood each time. \n\n\tHungama hogaya is definitely the most suited and entertaining song from the soundtrack. London Thumka starts off the entertainment during the Mehendi event. Badra Bahar is also a fun track that revolves around Rani's initial times in Paris. O Gujariya is Rani's transition into a fun-loving bride-to-be whereas Jugni and Kinare offer more depth in their lyrics to convey Rani's emotions and the story's implications. Amit Trivedi impresses yet again after his shot to fame with Wake up Sid, Udaan, Ek main aur ek tu, Kai po Che and Lootera. \n\n\tRani's solitary honeymoon turns out to be quite an adventure rather than a lonely, sulky escape. The screenwriters and dialogue writers have done very well with a story that wasn't supposed to provide depth and intricacy. Rather, Bahl's focus is maintained in the primary character and her relationships with strangers in a foreign land. It's Rani's vacation that is the focus and her transition is only a side-effect of all the fun she has away from home. Queen is thoroughly enjoyable in every aspect with Kangana's ground-breaking performance at its core. Vikas Bahl has brought meaning to a simple story with soulful music by Amit Trivedi, sharp editing, witty dialogues and genuine performances by the supporting cast. This Rani will win your heart and you will only be too glad to lose it. \n\n\t- 9.115 on a scale of 1-10.",

(She has apparently taken up the world's oldest profession as a temporary job to tide over the recession. Ugh.) Also, the non-Indian characters in the film sometimes veer into caricature. \n\nYet, all this adds up to one of the most sincere and heartfelt Hindi movies I have ever seen, and that is almost entirely due to a stunning performance by Kangana Ranaut. A lesser actress would have taken the simple, sweet, vulnerable Rani and turned her into a naive, cloying, emo nightmare. In Kangana's hands, she might well become an iconic heroine in Hindi cinema. It's too bad our award shows are a farce, because this is a landmark performance that truly deserves some real recognition. Credit must go to the director and screenwriters as well. It is so refreshing to see a role written for a woman where her sole object is not to acquire or assist a man.",

            "content": "All the relatives, infused with the joy of celebration, dancing around the bride-to-be Rani (means 'Queen' in English), who is getting her hands patterned (mehendi) as she excitedly talks about the marriage and her fiancé. From the very first glimpse we get of her (played by Kangana Ranaut), the innocence and naivety of this simple non-urban middle-class girl pierces through you, and you're hooked to her life right then. She is bound to get hurt, and that's what happens when her wannabe London-returned lover comes back and dumps her the day before the marriage. Heartbroken, she decides to go ahead with the honeymoon plan, for a break from everything. And this trip, through Paris and Amsterdam, proves to be a journey of self-discovery for her; she goes through her grief with the help of four varied and interesting people she befriends along the way, lives a little, and finally finds the importance of independence; it's about taking the reins of her life into her hands, and actually become the Queen of it. In a country where more than half of the women are forced to assess their lives by the men (most of them worthless) they marry, this movie is an uplifting tribute to women who gained their independence.\n\nAll the varied characters and situations in the movie have something to offer. The movie abounds in clichés - the free-spirited half-Indian single mother, the Muslim girl working at the strip club to cover family expenses, the good-looking and proud Italian chef, and the Indian Food ('golguppa') sale in a Foreign Fair - but all these are proficiently used to contribute something or the other to the characters and their stories, and that's what allows me to excuse or overlook them. There are moments which almost make you fall off the seat laughing, and there are others which make your eyes fill up. 'Queen' doesn't lag for a single moment; it's engaging and entertaining from beginning till the end of credits (yes!).\n\nAnd the leading lady Kangana Ranaut is the main reason why this movie is a triumph. Having no make-up on for majority of the film, Kangana charms her way through with her varied range of emotions and expressions, and terrific acting skills. I've always liked her work, but with this movie, I'm in awe of her. She gets tremendous support from the various talented actors who portray the supporting characters commendably. Especially Lisa Hayden, who is charming as the sultry waitress/ party-going girl and has a heart of gold. Everyone is aware of her exotic looks, but whoa, she can act well too.\n\nAfter co-directing the simple yet delightful 'Chillar Party' three years ago, this can be called Vikas Bahl's debut as a solo Director; he has co-written the script too. The skillful treatment of various themes, the proper development of the characters, the unbiased balance maintained between the Native and Foreign settings - all this is accredited to the brilliant Director. Already being associated with last year's best (among Hindi films), 'Lootera', and churning out an exhilarating movie like this, Bahl seems to have a good taste; I really look forward to his future work.\n\nThe crisp editing, the tasteful cinematography, and Amit Trivedi's appropriately-timed remarkable music score help create the overall masterpiece it is.\n\n(Rani) Getting drunk and dancing beside a random stranger on the street, sharing a Santa-Banta \"non-veg\" joke with her Russian friend and bragging about her sense of humour, innocently buying gifts for her family at a Sex Accessory Shop, are just few of the scenes from an incredibly memorable movie.\n\nLife is filled with pain and humour; to know, when to cry and when to laugh, helps you sail through it (life) smoothly. 'Queen' is a celebration of that fact, and is a heart-breaking yet heart-warming piece of Cinema!",

            "content": "This movie is aptly titled and it's release is perfectly timed on the eve of Women's Day, as it ably shows the inner strength and conviction of a very mediocre woman, who uses the stab of severe rejection, not to bleed into the state of utter depression filled with society imposed guilt, but to expand her horizon, and in the process learns a great deal about different lifestyles & cultures, makes myriad friends, proves her self worth and tastes the state of utter freedom (both by body and mind)! \n\nThough this journey of hers is hesitantly supported by her loving parents and kid brother, the carefree attitude and occasional mischievous 'been there, done that' glances thrown by her grandmother are something to watch out for. In a society like ours, usually an elderly woman expectantly appears so dedicated towards her spouse and family, that it seems impossible that her delicate heart ever nursed a feeling for any other man. But life has never been this simple for them. Due to unavoidable circumstances, shyness, fear, or even betterment, many of them did nurse a feeling for someone in the past, but ended up marrying someone else altogether! And since amongst themselves they do understand this, breakup of an impending marriage, is not that much of a hoo-haa for them, as much as they expectantly portray it to be. They do know that it is unacceptable but not unthinkable. And when it happens to their own blood, they do have the wisdom and conviction to make their granddaughters see the matter in a sensible light and pave their way. \n\nRani (literally meaning 'queen'), the protagonist is a girl-next-door, who is wooed over by a family friend's son, Vijay (Rajkummar Rao) into marriage. On the eve of the marriage, he breaks it up on the pretext of lifestyle and attitude difference that has widened between them due to his London based job and stay! After spending a night in extreme shock and tears, Rani decides to regain the control of her life by starting with going alone on her honeymoon trip (Paris and Amsterdam)! And in this trip, out of her comfort zone, she discovers a whole new different world, wherein all her past taboos seem right, and quite a few right notions seem wrong. She learns - to trust and enjoy the company of good strangers, to fight for herself, the taste of independence and success, and mostly the difference between so called right actions and right intent.\n\nKangana Ranaut has done a fantastic acting job. Her approach towards the role is very fresh and natural. With her history of living-on-the-edge glam roles, this one comes as a pleasant surprise. Her Indianisation started with 'Tanu Weds Manu' and she has come full circle with 'Queen'. Rajkummar Rao has expectantly done a brilliant job. Lisa Haydon is another surprise package in the film. Her natural uninhibited form with French accent is again something to watch out for. Mish Boyko, Jeffrey Ho, Joseph Guitobh, Canadea Lopez Marco who have played Kangana's roommates/associates in Amsterdam have also essayed their roles with great naturalness and ease. The child artist who plays Kangana's sibling appears convincing as a possessive kid brother. Rest of the cast has also performed well.\n\nSpecial applause needs to be given to the director, Vikas Bahl to present well and in perfect harmony, two very different sensibilities, one that of a middle class conservative Indian, and the other of an international traveler. He has also well captured the dilemma of the protagonist while making the consistent cross over between these two sensibilities. When using foreign locales and 100% foreign actors with the protagonist actor as Indian, very few movies are able to portray the true essence of the script. Hats off to the director, that this is one such movie.",

Even the simple Roohafza bottle at the dinner table scene made me feel so at home I felt I could smell the food.\n\nThe soundtrack was excellent, and the songs are relevant to the moment, and do not include any unnecessary mass synchronized choreographed dances.\n\nWhile the script has a couple of small weak moments, the good moments are so good that we can gleefully ignore the few problems. The growth of Rani in the movie feels organic as she goes on a journey of self actualization. Kudos to the director/writer Vikas Bahl for not falling in the cliché trap by  keeping Rani single and happy at the end of the movie, instead of showing that her happiness would have depended on her marrying the 'right' guy! \n\nThe Indianisms in the movie were handled with a very good taste with light hearted fun at the expense of the Indian Rishtedaari (family) system. Small things like Rani's email address \"happyrani@yahoo.com\", or the not so French Indian French Toast won me over.\n\nOverall, I believe that Rani is a must watch for everyone, and especially to the Delhiwallas, you are going to have a lot of fun! :D",

A woman's journey of self-discovery couldn't have been portrayed any better than this.",

He wooes her to the fullest and finally Rani agrees and marriage is set. But just at the eleventh hour, Vijay comes from London only to call it off. Everyone is shattered including Rani but she decides to have her honeymoon at Paris and Amsterdam, on her own. What happens from there forms the rest.\n\nThe director has come up with an interesting storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was  amazing. The dialogues were well written. The script was different and the screenplay made it gel perfectly one screen.The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was crisp. Costumes were well designed to suit the characters while the art department was natural. Kangna Ranaut carried the film very responsibly and she delivered her best. Lisa Haydon was not just smoking hot but also confident in her act. Rajkumar Rao was impressive, he scored well. Mish Boyko was worth mentioning, Jeffrey was entertaining, Guitobh Joseph was good.\n\nComing up with rom-coms is one thing but including them with some offbeat concepts is something else. It can be seen in this one and at the same time, the makers are tapping the women audience with such subjects. The first half goes on a lighter mode with elements of entertainment, some romance. The interval bang was promising and the second half has its own share of fun and emotional highs. Overall, this is a film which appeals due to the class audience.The films performances are rich, the direction amazing, and when it comes to women centric films, Queen is pathbreaking creating a new genre in hindi films. A must watch!!!",

Thankfully Queen will change all that. She is all set to reign. Vikas Behl strikes all the right chords with Queen.. well almost.. Barring a very few dull moments, Queen succeeds majorly because it has a soul. The script is pretty straight forward, but the way Kangna carries the entire movie on her shoulders, is incredible. And some on-your-face scenes reflect the Indian male-dominant society so well. Take for example. \"Humare yahan na ladkiyon ko dakaar lena allowed nahi hai\" or \"Beta shadi ke baad jab ye baap-bete office chale jayenge, hum log itna enjoy karenge, chai banayenge, magazine padhenge, kitty party jayenge\". It may not end up earning a lot, but it will always be a very important film. It could have been perfect with a tighter script and a better usage of songs, but yes, Hungama hone do.. Also, you won't see many films where each and every scene has the protagonist in it. You will definitely bring Rani with you while coming out of the theatres. Good going, Bollywood!",

She makes every scene come right out of screen...there are so many of those scenes which reflect the attitude of a pure indian woman and the small nuances which I might add excellently played by kangna  keep that upside curve on your face throughout. Kangana's is the heart and soul of Queen and she does not strike a single false note. \nIf you have a slow weekend and you really want to end in a peppy note, I highly recommend you go watch it...and I promise you will not even stand up when the end credits start rolling over, cos there is a very FRESH surprise hidden for you... all in teh \"FACEBOOK\" style...",

How she has maintained a studied silence and hot back at all her critics through her work is an example worth emulating in all walks of life.\n\nThe basic story is a theme that has been done a few times earlier but never quite as well or as engaging as this one.\n\nThe main credit has got to go to Vikas Bahl, in  his first solo director film (He was co director of Chillar Party), the screenplay writers ( Chaitally Parmar and Parveez Shaikh), the dialogue writers (Anvita Dutt and Kangana Ranaut) and of course, the star of the show - Kangana Ranaut.\n\nHer expressions, her innocence, her sincerity, her reactions to situations (the bag snatching scene and the first night in the hotel as well as hostel scene) are so natural, that you would think that this was real life being played out in front of you.\n\nShe is very ably supported by Lisa Haydon who is outstanding in her all too brief role of the first friend that Rani makes on her solo honeymoon trip.\n\nMuch as I would like to say that Rajkumar was excellent, he was clearly overshadowed by the trio of Rani's hostel friends played by Jeffrey Chee Eng Ho (Taka), Mish Boyko (Oliksander aka Sikander!) and Marco Canadea (Marcello). The bonding and fun times shared by these 4 is heart warming and its so sad when they have to go their separate ways..........\n\nI am urging, no, actually ORDERING you to go and watch this movie as soon as you possibly can, you will thank me for it!!!! I am hoping and praying that this one makes it to the 100.....150....200 crore club, because this is one movie that truly deserves that kind of success!!!!!",
