    "summary": "Although awkward college student Todd Howard (Jason Bateman) is particularly adept at science, he's paying for school with an athletic scholarship that he will lose should he not fare well in an upcoming boxing tournament. Luckily for Todd, he has inherited the same family curse that once turned his cousin into a werewolf. As he transforms into the hairy, fanged, howling monster, he finds both his physical agility and his popularity skyrocketing -- but at what cost?",

Maybe they originally wanted Michael J. Fox to come back considering this is a college movie over High School but he smartly turned it down.  But I doubt his replacement Jason Bateman who plays Todd had a hard audition process as his dad was one of the producer.  Also, there are some annoying characters and the Dean who's pretty dumb to give a kid a sports scholarship without even knowing anything of the kid or looking if that sport was even part of his permitted record.  But it's not horrible either but it's the same story, with the same jokes and the same lesson.  It's not horrible, it's far from good.  It's just meh, and nepotism needs to end in Hollywood.",

            "content": "The first Teen Wolf is goofy but fun, so I went into this one expecting something similar, if a little less original. What I just watched is among the worst movies I've seen. Every line of dialogue is cringeworthy, not only in the way it is written but the way it is delivered. Every scene feels extremely awkward even though nothing really happens in them. The characters act so inconsistently and the acting is so stilted it is difficult to follow what's going on. It's as if the writers had as little idea as we do where the story is going and why the characters are acting the way they are. Relationships change drastically between scenes: one minute Todd (Jason Bateman), the teen wolf, is yelling furiously at his classmate Nicki (Estee Chandler), the next he's flirting with her like he hadn't just acted terrible and showed glowing red eyes. Halfway through, the movie just gives up on dialogue and dives into a 3 minute long montage of Bateman being a werewolf jerk. The wolf makeup looks like a mask for an aging chimp that the makers of Planet of the Apes threw away, managing to make the character less sympathetic and likable than he already is. The supporting cast are even worse, either yelling obnoxiously, staring at Bateman with creepy intensity, or doing nothing at all. Even though these characters may feel few, because they are so irrelevant, there are actually a lot of them, ever present and in the audience as the teen wolf dances stupidly and lip syncs terribly or gets pummeled in slow motion in the boxing ring. Boxing ends up being the center of the story, even more so than being a werewolf, and we are subjected to extended boxing sequences between characters we barely even know. What makes this worse is that college boxing isn't even a thing. That shows how much the writers were trying when they came up with this one. Eventually they stoop to a fart joke. Well, not even a joke. It's just a fart. But it's funny and it proves to be the highlight of the movie.",

            "content": "I'm not sure what's going on with the movies title here, is that suppose to be a clever play on words or something? or maybe just a quirky way of showing its a sequel without using a boring number 2. Anyway this time around we follow the lycanthropic antics of Scott Howard's cousin Todd.\n\nThe basic story for this movie is also the basic problem...its exactly the flippin' same. The original movie saw Scott battle with his affliction in high school, dealing with puberty, love, girls, bullies, friends, grades and of course the main issue of his basketball team. In this story Todd has just gotten into his university and has to deal with being a young adult, love, girls, bullies, friends, grades and the main issue of his boxing team. The difference here being Todd doesn't know he's a werewolf and has his first 'wolf-out' occurrence in his new uni surroundings conveniently.\n\nOK so they are pretty much rehashing the first movie...could still be good. Thing is the plot doesn't really add up and is full of blatant idea pinching from the first movie. First off the coach on this uni boxing team is the same coach from Scott's basketball team in high school in the first film! He is actually suppose to be the same person! How would this high school coach now be the coach in this uni at the exact time when Scott's cousin is there? The answer to that is this coach got Todd a full athletic scholarship based on the hopes that Todd is also a werewolf and will turn the uni boxing team into champs. What??!! is that for real?! OK he could help with the scholarship for Todd but how did he manage to become the boxing coach at the same time?? OK OK breathe...\n\nThat's one major nonsensical plot point, another is why Scott's father Harold (James Hampton back again) is here. He lives in Beacon Town, Nebraska according to my sources, Todd's university is Hamilton which in reality is located in Colorado (I'm guessing the same for the movie). Now those two states are connected admittedly so its possible these two locations could be close (or not)...but why would Scott's dad be even in this story? Why would he be hanging around and watching the final boxing match? is he staying in a motel somewhere?\n\nAnother point that does tend to spring to mind when you watch is why the hell these people haven't turned into mega rich celebrities by now with there impressive family gift. I would of thought by now the science world would be all over them wanting to learn from them, take samples, run tests etc...they'd be on TV, in movies, in papers etc...a new form of humanoid! The fact that Harold flaunts his lycanthropy without a care in the world you'd think many would know by now, he's basically exposing himself. Yet the fact when people do see him as a werewolf they are still shocked...kinda says to me the Howard's haven't come out of the werewolf closet yet. Am I being too picky here? yeah maybe but come on!\n\nThe other gaping issues I have with the movie is the continuity or lack of...or shambolic attempt at. OK so I already told you that the coach was suppose to be the same character from the first movie, unfortunately they cast someone who obviously doesn't look like the original guy plus they try to copy the original guys hair and fail. Next up is the classic character of Styles, he's back...but played by someone else. Unfortunately and with great wisdom they cast a clearly much younger person to play Styles plus this guy looks totally and utterly nothing like the original character. Next is John 'Gomez' Astin as the Dean of the university, an original character...oops no, they make him exactly the same character as Principal Thorne in the original movie with the exact same motives. The only proper continuity is Mark Holton as Chubby...wait...did they actually have a musical number in this?\n\nSo yeah there are a lot of problems with this movie, glaring easy to spot problems, but its not all bad. They do get the werewolf makeup and prosthetics correct which is nice to see, they do look very close to the original although not quite as good. Jason Bateman does actually fit the role well, he is a likable guy and he does look kinda similar to Fox truth be told, you could believe they are related. That (now) entire cliched 80's frat house vibe is strong here naturally but that's a rose-tinted retro plus point, also check out all the cute 80's girls in their 80's fashions (God I miss the 80's). Lastly the boxing finale is reasonably exciting, it looks OK and relatively realistic, it does just about give you the buzz needed in the end.\n\nIn short this movie can't compare to the original in any way. The original had that low budget appeal, a cracking 80's score, some cheeky semi-adult angles and charismatic characters. This movie merely regurgitates the lot but its watered down to appeal to more people. The score doesn't have the same emotional force behind it, the characters are a shadow of their former selves, the new characters are cheap rip-offs of the previous ones and they literately copy the original plot almost scene for scene. One fatal mistake being this time they actually make the main hero character unlikable by the midway point. He becomes such a showboating show off as the wolf and clearly becomes an asshole, where as Scott in the original movie was always likable even with his inflated ego.\n\nDespite all that its still an enjoyable movie I can't deny, maybe its because I grew up with these movies as a kid makes me biased. Even though its a bad sequel, if you try not to think about the superior original and take it as it is, you do have an easy going fun piece of trashy 80's trash.",

Teen Wolf Too jumped the shark after Teen Wolf intentionally came close to doing it many times but evading it through the natural comedic charm of its wolf theme.

We see the same progression in Todd as we had scene before with Michael J. Fox's Scott, where both characters turn on their friends and become real jerks after getting a taste of teenage popularity. The only difference here is that Todd is now playing for the college boxing team rather than a high school basketball team. When topped off with the rather ugly make-up effects, Jason Bateman looks more like a disfigured cat than he ever does a wolf.

They weren't needed and while I could have accepted one (Mark Holton as Chubby), Uncle Harold, Coach Finstock and even Stiles (who is played by a different actor for some reason) don't need to be in this film.\nBut that's not what truly makes this film a bummer.  Sure it wasn't likely going to be as good as the first film but did it have to be practically the same film? High School turns into College, basketball turns into boxing, and M. J. Fox turns into J. Bateman but it's otherwise the same damn film. The big difference is this one (other than being a blatant copy) doesn't have the charm of the first film and instead fills the screen with Revenge of the Nerds antics. Now I like Revenge of the Nerds and Animal House as much as the next guy but that wasn't what Teen Wolf was about.  \nTeen Wolf Too lacks the heart of the original and instead fills the gaps with garbage jokes and antics.

The fact that Michael J. Fox is absent from the film makes this a bland affair. There's really nothing new going on here, and Teen Wolf Too is just a poor sequel to a comedy horror classic. The result on-screen is a film that just doesn't have anything interesting. This film just tries to cash in on the success of the original, and it does it very poorly. This film was horrible, and doesn't have the magic the first one had. The first one was cheesy, but it was lots of fun from start to finish. However this film is just too predictable, and add to that a bad cast, a poorly written script that just isn't interesting, and you have a bad film. Stick with the original, although cheesy, imperfect and corny at times, it was a fun film to watch. This, on the other hand is just a failed attempt at building on the original by using old ideas instead of using something new. This is just a tiresome film that isn't worth your time. Jason Batman has done much better than this, and he does what he can with such a poor script, but ultimately it ends up being a dire, predictable and boring film that you just don't care about.

Pretty funny seeing Gomez from the original Adams Family in this movie. Plus a lot of familiar looking television actors. I'm pretty sure that Stiles is not the original Stiles too. Enjoyable but lame.",

Fox refused to return (citing the discomfort of the make-up as a factor), and so producer Kent Bateman turned to his own son, Jason (now of Arrested Development fame) to step in. You have to feel for poor Jason. He gamely gives it his best, but he's working with such an awful script that, despite his best efforts, the film is kind of a disaster. A lot of the characters return from the first film (some played by different actors) in an attempt to connect this sequel to the first film (Bateman plays the cousin of Michael J Fox's character), but most of the film doesn't work. It follows exactly the same plot as the previous film, but with school replaced with college and basketball replaced with boxing. It's worth watching though for a really bizarre song and dance sequence halfway through, with Bateman in full wolf get-up. Odd",

At first Bateman is afraid of the curse, but then he embraces it and becomes the popular kid in school, and joins the boxing team.  While doing this he loses his friends and the girl he likes, only to learn of his mistakes and stop being the wolf in the final match.  Change the basketball match to a boxing match, and shift around a few faces (Though not all of them, as the friends from the first film are back, playing the exact same \"I feel ignored now\" friends) and you have a complete and unnecessary rehash of the first film.  On top of it all though, this film decided to throw away all the laughs and charm of the first film, and instead added a bad after school special feel to it.  In the end what you have is a horribly boring deja vu experience that you will be counting down the clock for its finale.  I'm going to give it one star just because it at least had the cliche 80's musical montage in the middle of it, but even that wasn't done very well.  Bateman, what were you thinking? Oh yeah... $!",

The original has charm, engaging characters, an excellent soundtrack, Michael J. Fox, and it's very, very funny. This sequel has none of that, plus a lot of other things it should have but doesn't. Jason Bateman is saddled with make-up that makes him look like Cornelius from 'Planet of the Apes' has had a nasty run-in with a belt sander, while the recasting of two major characters from the first film (Finstock and Stiles) is just rubbing salt in the wound.

From Jason Bateman  to Mark Holton, the cast shines from start to finish, refusing to bow to cheap sentiment or manipulation. And the closing scene? Not God's wrath, silly boy, but a quick jolt to remind us that our \"concerns,\" seemingly all-consuming and so damned important, are little more than neuroses that keep us scared to death of each other.

Don't get the wrong idea though - \"Teen Wolf Too\" certainly pleases me. With knockout performances by Jason Bateman and John Astin, the second installment in the \"Wolf\" series is not better than the first, but it is definitely a respectable follow-up.
