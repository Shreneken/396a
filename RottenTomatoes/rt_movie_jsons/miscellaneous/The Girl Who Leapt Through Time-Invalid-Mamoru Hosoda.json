            "content": "All three of his films that said, the other two being Summer Wars and Wolf Children, while neither without flaws(Summer Wars did have too many characters with some better-developed than others and Wolf Children had an at times rushed beginning and ended inconclusively) are great films and near-masterpieces almost as good as the best of Studio Ghibli.\n\nThe Girl Who Leapt Through Time did get a little too complicated at the end and the character designs lacked the sophistication and detail of the rest of the animation. Speaking of the rest of the animation on the other hand, it's fantastic(something that all three of Hosoda's films have in common) with its luscious watercolour-like backgrounds and beautiful colours. The animation in the time-leaping is so inventive and effortlessly drawn it leaves one breathless. The film also has a great music score(another thing that all three Hosoda films had), it's positively hypnotic and sometimes rousing and sometimes melancholic, I also much appreciated the use of unobtrusive piano scoring.\n\nThere is a thoughtful script that sounds remarkably natural(Japanese and American, dubs don't always translate well but it does fine here), complete with a deft balance of comedy and drama. The story is always engaging and not boring at all, it's funny, it's poignant, it's imaginative and it's thought-provoking, also using the time travel idea very effectively(one of the better films to do so). The messaging is well-handled and not laid on too thick. The characters are likable and interesting rather than being swamped by the time travel and the voice acting is good in the American dub(even if the title character's voice acting may be shrill for some, personally it wasn't a problem) and very good indeed in the Japanese version.\n\nOverall, a great film, near-masterpiece status in fact. If you loved The Girl Who Leapt Time and haven't seen Summer Wars or Wolf Children yet, do so. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Mamoru Hosoda, one of the contemporary Japanese anime directors, frequently follows certain patterns in his feature-length anime films. Certain elements are usually linked to each other by bearing symbolic meanings. Different creatures become family members. An object, usually an image, takes us back and forth in time. Tradition plays an important role in shaping modern life. In this review, I will explain these recurring elements in five different anime films that Hosoda produced after the 2000s: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006), Summer Wars (2009), Wolf Children Ame and Yuki (2012), The Boy and the Beast (2015), Mirai (2018). We will look at how Mamoru Hosoda reproduces the issues of family ties and childhood, creatures and strangers, traditions and roots, classical master-apprentice relations, country and city, time and space in his unique narrative style. \n\nFull review: https://guncesinema.com/en/from-aliens-to-family-from-family-to-roots/",

Rather, it's a lighted-hearted story with a fair share of chuckles along the way. While it does have some parallels to Groundhog's Day, I personally see more in common with The Crown. Read: a saga with a low stakes love triangle. All in all, the animation might be the biggest harbinger of the movie's quality. There are moments where it's beautiful, but for the most part, the repetitive cel animation felt more tired than fresh.",

            "content": "I love time travel, possibly more than any other story-telling device I‚Äôve ever seen. It is an element that fascinates me so much that I rarely dislike a movie in that subgenre of sci-fi/fantasy. Because of that I was genuinely excited to watch The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, even though I‚Äôm not a huge anime fan. Through most of this movie the story is more focused on a coming-of-age story and a teen romance rather than the time-travel element. I didn‚Äôt mind this at all, because they still sprinkled in the time-leaping for some comedy, and to show what was most important to the protagonist. This early section of the movie does a good job of establishing the characters and their motivations, which gets you emotionally invested before the plot gets absolutely crazy. (And this plot gets much more complicated than just a teenage girl frivolously leaping through time to do better on her math test, even though it seems like that is the story in the first act.) One of my problems with The Girl Who Leapt Through Time was that it felt unfocused and even a bit sloppy. It‚Äôs as if the writers had so much they wanted to do with this movie, and instead of picking the best or most important things, they tried to do them all. So there are a number of little subplots that don‚Äôt weave well into the main plot, and most of them are left hanging or are introduced out of nowhere. For instance, there is a story about a student who is adversely affected by the first few time leaps in the film, and this causes his life to spiral out of control. In any other movie this would serve as the impetus for the protagonist to realize the fault in her choices and try to atone for what has happened to this young man. Instead we never see him again, and never know if his life is still terrible or if the last leap helped him, he‚Äôs just forgotten. This is just one example of the strange plotting, and there were more (like a picture that shows up in the third act and suddenly becomes a central MacGuffin for the story.) There‚Äôs also an explanation of the time travel and an attempt to quantify it that I thought took away from the simplicity of the story that had been established. The movie literally freezes for this one long scene where all I could picture was a writer who felt he had to justify everything that had happened up to that point, and the only thing it did was lead to more questions. The end of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time also added to the confusion. It felt incomplete and strange, as if they were trying to let you draw your own interpretations, but I was befuddled and couldn‚Äôt deduce what was going to happen after the credits rolled. Almost any movie that uses time travel can be confusing, and I am generally able to ignore the muddled storytelling because I‚Äôm having so much fun that it doesn‚Äôt matter to me. So, despite all the weird stuff going on and the over-complicated plot they introduced late in the film, I still enjoyed The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.",

Driven by a dense but consistently intriguing narrative, the film-like many other time-travel tales-touches on issues related to fate vs. free will and selfishness vs. sacrifice. Is the film's protagonist using her seemingly unique abilities purposefully? Or are her actions causing unintended-and potentially irreversible-harm? For most sci-fi fans, this is familiar material, but the execution is strong enough to forgive both the copious amounts of high school melodrama and the vague sense of \"been there, done that.\"\n\nThe aforementioned protagonist is Makoto (voice of Riisa Naka), a plucky tomboy who's admittedly not the brightest nor the most coordinated girl in her school. She's a regular on the baseball diamond with her two best (male) friends, Chiaki (voice of Takuya Ishida) and Kousuke (Mitsutaka Itakura). The trio is virtually inseparable, though Makoto insists her feelings toward each boy are entirely platonic.\n\nOne day, Makoto is stumbling around the chemistry lab, when she slips and falls on something and experiences something intense, surreal, almost indescribable. The feeling lasts only for a few moments before it subsides and she moves on. But the next day, the brakes on Makoto's bike fail at an incredibly inopportune moment. She careens wildly down a steep road toward an oncoming train and certain death. With impact just an instant away, the feeling returns and Makoto is suddenly halfway back up the hill and relatively unscathed.\n\n\"Leaping through time\" is what Makoto's oddly prescient aunt calls her startling new skill, and the young girl just loves it. She starts leaping to perform better on tests, avoid embarrassingly clumsy moments at school, and eat the last pudding before her sister beats her to it again. But when Chiaki confesses to liking her, Makoto leaps to avoid the conversation entirely. It's situations like this, when people's feelings get hung up in her leaping, that turn Makoto's whole world upside down.\n\nYou never get the sense that The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is spinning its wheels, but all throughout the film's first two thirds, the end of the road seems hazy. Much of this has to do with the film editing, which is delightfully chaotic, but the emphasis on the interpersonal relationships gives one the sense that Hosoda and company aren't exactly swinging for the fences here. Will The Girl Who Leapt Through Time really only follow Makoto's emotional quest to admit her feelings to the boy she totally thinks is cute and stuff? Thankfully, no, but it does feature prominently throughout the entire film, even the much juicier final third. It ultimately works because we care about Makoto, but there's no denying the film is on much firmer ground once the time-travel machinations really kick into gear.\n\nAnd boy, when this film gets going, it does so in a big way. The dramatic climax is a genuinely surprising switcheroo-the kind of giant swerve that derails a lot of films but manages to set The Girl Who Leapt Through Time on a much more satisfying path. Around every corner, another piece to this complex puzzle falls into place, which means The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is one of those rare sci-fi beasts whose conclusion feels satisfying when it comes to both character and story arcs.\n\nAs much as we like Makoto and want to see her grow, there are times when both the way she's written and the way Riisa Naka voices her threaten our allegiance to her. She has, hands down, the most annoying laugh this side of Fran Drescher, and the amount of times she violently hits her head would be comical if it wasn't just a smidge annoying. As far as her actions go, they aren't so selfish that we can't sympathize with her, but they're certainly a little childish.\n\nThe Girl Who Leapt Through Time doesn't enchant the same way the very best Miyazaki films do, but it's certainly a film worth watching. The animation itself is simple, but Hosoda (best known for, of all things, Digimon) gets creative when appropriate. He also makes terrific use of sound (rhythmic grasshoppers frequently threaten to lull you to sleep before you're jolted awake by the sound of another Makodo leap). If you're a fan of movies with time travel, this is certainly one for you. It's no The Terminator or Back to the Future, obviously, but it's a perfectly respectable entry in the sub-genre.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/girl-who-leapt-through-time-review/",

            "content": "This overrated movie cements in my eyes Mamoru Hosoda's status as an overrated director, although I really liked Ookami kodomo no ame to yuki (8.0). \n\nI expected more from the animation; the combination of studio Madhouse and the high praise this movie enjoys filled me with expectation, but in the end it was nothing out of the ordinary. Of course ordinary for Madhouse means a cut above the rest. So, great but not spectacular, animation.\n\nThe movie begins as a \"slice of high-school life\" with some time-leaping shenanigans. For the most part the movie does a good job for the first two thirds; the heroine, Makoto, behaves pretty naturally and develops along with the increasingly complex time-leaping machinations. \n\nThe movie centers around Makoto, so I will not fault it too much about the underdeveloped side characters, but I have to point out the the strong friendship (or awkward love triangle) between Makoto and the two boys feels forced. I wouldn't reproach that aspect of their relationship if it didn't became so important in the plot later.\n\nThe director attempts escape the genre's prose by introducing some stylistic elements: The actual leaps in order to leap through time, showing numerous times the pompous phrase \"time awaits for no one\", and gently insinuating the heroine of the source material as the \"aunt witch\" (Kazuko Yoshiyama). Those tricks work, but they don't offer anything of substance. \n\nIn the final third of the movie the problems appear in massive amounts. First of all, have the inevitable plot holes that associate themselves whenever a work of art depicts some form of non linear time line. People don't seem to mind (yes, I am looking at you, Interstellar fans) but a bunch of plot holes really spoils things for me. I will address the major plot hole in parable form in order to avoid spoilers:\n\nGenie: \"Congratulations, you have three wishes\"\nMakoto: \"I want to have an infinite amount of wishes\"\nGenie: \"Cool choice sister, infinite wishes it is\"\n\nAnother problem is the dubious motivations of the characters towards the end. I don't want to spoil anything, but motives are not well established. If you couple that with the also poor established time travel \"rules\" you have a mess of a third act. And the mess continues to the very end; Gungrave (7.0/10) managed to salvage itself from it's shitty third act by providing a heartfelt ending, here we have a vanilla ending, devoid of any real emotion. \n\nThere are more faults I could whine about; like the lack of sufficient stakes or lessons for the heroine, but I think you get the idea: It begins as a calm and sweet movie, but fails to deliver. You could do worse, but you can do so much better. 5.5/10. \n\nIf you liked the good aspects of this movie, like the slice of life and coming of age, I would suggest Sakamichi no Apollon (7.5/10), Cross game (9.0/10), and Barakamon (8.0/10).",

            "content": "For me, the two strongest points in the narrative of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is the humour and outcomes that are both portrayed in the time travel aspect of the film.\n\nIn relation to the humour, the script has a clever way of portraying the funny circumstances that could happen if somebody were to use time travel for their own desires, which is exactly what happens to Makoto and her friends in the 1st half of the film.\n\nIn regard to the outcomes portrayed in the events of the film, what I love the most about The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is the way it portrays time travel from a very negative perspective, particularly in the 2nd half of the film. I feel like Mamoru Hosoda is saying that the tough circumstances we face in life could always be worse and that affecting them for our own benefit could lead to possibly worse consequences than we ever anticipated, which is exactly what happens to the people surrounding Makoto, so it's almost like we live in the best of all possible worlds and that we should appreciate the life we have now. This all leads to some good emotion and twists in the narrative during the 3rd act.\n\nOverall, while I do prefer Hosoda's two later films, Summer Wars and Wolf Children, a little bit more, I do still really love The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. It  has an excellent balance of comedy and drama and I think it's a very strong start to the director's career of feature length Anime films.\n\nI really can't wait for his next film, The Boy and the Beast. With Studio Ghibli potentially not making any more films, the works of Mamoru Hosoda are the next ones on my radar for now.",

That is not to say that it isn't an enjoyable movie though, as I actually really liked the film. The movie runs at 90 minutes, which just isn't enough time to flesh out the characters while dealing with themes of loss, memory, adolescence, time travel and love. With a bit more time to realize the relationships between the three lead characters, this could have been an incredible film, one that would have been much more poignant. It is still a decent anime, one which is worth checking out if you enjoy the genre. A better film by the same studio and director would be Summer Wars. As it stands, I believe the film deserves 3.5 stars out of 5.",
