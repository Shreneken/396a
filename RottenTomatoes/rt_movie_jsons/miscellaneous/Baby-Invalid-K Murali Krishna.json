            "content": "Reviews on ?BABY?\n\nFirst reaction after the movie: Huh? Finished? \n\nSubsequently, started discussing it with friends. I would say this is the result the director wanted. Discussion and thoughts on social issues and will you behave like Jiang Meng if you are her and what will you do if you are in the father's shoes. \n\nMy friend and I had different views: \nMe: Standing from the point of view of the baby, I would rather pass away without much torture and avoid facing the difficulties that Jiang Meng had in the movie. \nMy friend's views: She has an Aunt that has stage 4 cancer and has been very strong and determined to live ever since she was diagnosed with this illness. Very similar to Jiang Meng, her Aunt has won against the battle with cancer, their strong will to survive and fight against illnesses are worth to praise. \n\nCASTS:\n3 main casts has very different roles and characteristics, it's not possible to say who had the best performances because they are playing different individuals with different characters.\nJiang Meng: In fact, I feel that the more simpler  and innocent the role is, the more difficult it is to portray. Because most actors has experienced a lot after all, turning them into a person that is so small that no one will pay attention to them when they walk on the street is a big trial. Yang Mi did an excellent job portraying this character. Besides using her eyes to express Jiang Meng's stubbornness and determination, I also noticed that she did take note of the small details like walking slightly clumsily and talking with lack of breath. I did not see a trace of Yang Mi, of Bai Qian, of Fuyao or any of her other roles in this movie, I see only Jiang Meng. Put aside prejudice, you will see a serious actress.\nXiao Jun: This actor did a great job too as a deaf/mute character. My friend who learnt sign language said that this is exactly how a real mute/deaf person would behave, making her wonder if this actor is really deaf/mute. \nFather: My friend and I both agreed that there isn't much to say about the father because there wasn't much action for him in the movie. However, we can see that the father mentally suffered due to his daughter's illness.\n\nSTORYLINE/FILMING:\nThis is NOT a movie for those looking for action and excitement. It's a very quiet movie that allows you to walk into the world of the physically challenged community and feel them. And most importantly, feel blessed that we are born healthy and capable of helping people that needs our help just like the hospital social workers.  The small little details in the movie ~ the interaction between the mother, the deaf friend and Jiang Meng~ allows you to feel the strong love between human beings even in an imperfect world.\nI would have given the movie 5 stars if there are slightly more explanation on the background of Jiang Meng. As in how she survived her childhood and the difficulties she faced. And even 6 stars if there are more touching moments like Jiang Meng asking why she just can't have the rights to take care of her foster mother.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe movie serves its purpose making the society more aware of the physically challenged community and life of abandoned children in China. \nAs a foreigner, we have always known that China has this One-Child policy due to over-population but has never really understand the issues that arises from this policy and the efforts that the government put in to help. For me, I always thought that parents in China abandoned their baby if she's a girl and leave her to die even though the baby is healthy due to this policy and the government did not do much to counter this issue. This movie did an excellent job bringing us into the world of China and understand how the governement has been working on this issue and see China's progress throughout these years. \nHowever, it still leaves us questioning on whether the government's policy on 'forcing' foster children to leave their foster home after turning 18 is right. I believe there is a reason behind this though.",
