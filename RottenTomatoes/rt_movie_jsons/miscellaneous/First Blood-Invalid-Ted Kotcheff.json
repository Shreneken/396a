    "summary": "Vietnam veteran and drifter John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) wanders into a small Washington town in search of an old friend, but is met with intolerance and brutality by the local sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy). When Teasle and his deputies restrain and shave Rambo, he flashes back to his time as a prisoner of war and unleashes his fury on the officers. He narrowly escapes the manhunt, but it will take his former commander (Richard Crenna) to save the hunters from the hunted.",

            "content": "One of the most highly regarded action flicks ever made, and one I took an inordinate amount of time to get round to watching, but I'm so glad I finally did. First Blood, or Rambo: First Blood, or just Rambo, I have no idea, gave us the 2nd of Stallone's most iconic characters, and one that, if anything, was harder to understands than the first. If you're only familiar with the later day Rambo films, you might expect this to be the one that set the template for them, but no, far from it. The films that came out in more recent years are preposterously violent bloodbaths where our mumbling hero mows down wave after wave of faceless baddies. In First Blood, across 95 minutes, only one person dies, and you could argue that it was an accident, and therefore, our lead doesn't kill a single person. How often can you say that about an action movie? This was 1982, before the Schwarzenegger guns and bombs heyday, where high kill counts and bombastic action set pieces would become commonplace. Frist Blood essentially subverted big dumb actions movies before they were even a mainstream phenomenon. Stallone spends most of the film running away and hiding, not fighting and killing. He's hyped up as a one-man army, but rather than taking out people left and right, he's more concerned with escaping from perilous situations, not blasting his way out of them, and the film ends with an emotional breakdown, not a gunfight. Also, the characters are given a lot of nuance. Nobody is 100% good or bad. Baddies admit they might be wrong, goodies occasionally resort to brutal tactics. But Rambo is a survivor and not an aggressor, and as such you feel his pain. The film has a real kinetic intensity to it. You feel every blow and duck at every gunshot. It has its fair amount of 80s cheese, mostly owing to the dialogue, which frequently priorities quippiness over realism. But there's a reason that First Blood is still being talked about and praised 40 years after its release. It's just so damn good!",

            "content": "There is a lot going on in this film.\nMy father was a Airborne Ranger in Vietnam and a LRRP team leader. He did two and a half tours (earning 2 Silver Stars and 3 Bronze w/V) before getting wounded and coming back and becoming a Minneapolis Police Officer (Detective Sergeant - 30 years). This was one of his favorite films, because he saw the film from both points of view.\nFirst, it's important to understand that Vietnam was a very unpopular war and the Hippies in the 60's caused a LOT of damage in their misguided to seek \"Peace & Love\".\nSecond, in 1973 (just 9 years before this film) there was a huge military records fire that destroyed about 80% of all US Army records for individuals discharged up to 1960. For years the full extent of the damage wasn't even known, so there were 10's of THOUSANDS of indigent out there pretending to be veterans, panhandling, committing petty crimes, and making life in small towns with limited resources difficult for law enforcement and other public services. Teasel's treatment of Rambo at the beginning (driving him out of town) was fairly common practice at the time, especially for a small-town Sherriff (who has a LOT more autonomy because they are an elected official in a small-town). All this was fairly well-known when the book and the film were released. \nThird, Sheriff Teasel is a Korean War Hero (recipient of the 2nd highest award for valor in combat, the Distinguished Service Cross - 2nd only to the Medal of Honor) and is VERY old-school. He has little respect for the Vietnam generation\nWith this in mind, while Teasel is definitely an ass, he isn't really the \"Evil\" one in the film, that would be Deputy Art Galt. Teasel brought Rambo in on minimal charges, yes, but don't forget most states allow law enforcement to hold people without charging them at all on \"reasonable suspicion\" for 48 hours - and that doesn't count weekends and federal holidays. When Teasel comes downstairs to see Galt losing his cool, Teasel barks at them and Galt instantly goes submissive. Teasel has to stop Galt from potentially shooting into a group of people when Rambo is fleeing (and is considered at this time a fleeing felon after assaulting multiple police officers - Teasel isn't aware of what happened in the basement to provoke that at this point), but other than that from his point of view this is all on Rambo. In fact, he isn't even aware that Rambo is actually even a Veteran - much less a member of the Special Forces and recipient of the Medal of Honor - until after his \"friend\" has died.\nDad had a lot of sympathy for both characters, because he could see the film from both sides. It really made him think. Several times he and I got drunk together and he was in pretty bad shape just having to vent what happened to him. He died in 2004 in an auto accident with my mother during a rainstorm, so it wasn't suicide, but I know he considered it several times - but always found a reason not to. The American Legion Post in St. Paul Minnesota is named after my father, Patrick M Novack Post# 5222, his badge number. It was one of his favorite films, and is also one of mine.",

This was a risk taken by Stallone and was very successful. Initially this was almost a 3hr long film with 15 kills by Rambo himself. When Stallone heard the script, he had anticipated this to be a total career killer. Then he edited the script to be a 90 min long psychological thriller with chunks of action and very less kills. The film is a study of some great characters. First and foremost John Rambo, a man who wants to lead a normal life but is rejected by society. Secondly, we have Teasel, a small town sheriff who is surpassed by his arrogance. Its placed fantastically by Brian Denehy. It's action is also shot really well. But one of the strongest points of the film is the message it delivers on the treatment of the Vietnam vets post the war. Now, there are a couple of scenes where some forced humor creeps in and there is a scene where logic is defeated during action but besides that a must watch for cinephiles.",

My buddies who I also played high school football with were also closet Scouts it was never \"cool\" to be in the Scouts back in the day. Needless to say we got into the \"survival vibe\" and couldn't wait to have an opportunity where we could screw off the top of massive hunting knives and use the needle and thread to sew up a cut in our arm. To help satisfy that itch, we watched First Blood a lot.\n\nBrian Dennehy is excellent as a charismatic asshole Sheriff of a small hick town that really doesn't like drifters. It was fun to see an early David Caruso before he moved to Florida and always wore sunglasses, staring into the camera making stupid one-liners. Stallone, who must've decided after Rocky he needed to get super ripped which was cool but made his eyes really droopy.\n\nThe first half is epic. Five star action sequences. Unfortunately, once Sam Trautman shows up as Rambo's former commander, thing's start getting a bit hokey. He spouts corny lines, Rambo get's spooked by rats in a tunnel, and then Rambo drives back to the town that shunned him because ... I dunno, he's enjoying kicking everybody's ass? Trautman's presence frankly cheapens the movie a bit to what could've been a more serious drama.\n\nAnd in the end Stallone gets to ACT -- sobbing uncontrollably at one point.

I have now seen this masterpiece approx. 18 times in full and my 1st time was when I was 12 when it debuted and was lucky enough to watch at the drive in theater in Penticton, BC.  My dad forgot about me and my brother to come get us after 11 pm and I also have that memory too, I guess...smiles. \nIF you have not seen this great action flick with such great cinematography and filmed pretty much exclusively in Hope, BC...have you lived in some shell so far?\nOne of Stallone's absolute best roles, ever, period!",

Its a straightforward story of a US army veteran from Vietnam who was also a POW who suffering from PTSD is abused by local cops on a small Washington town. He goes on a rampage to get revenge on his enemies. This movie is incredible with great action scenes but most importantly deep political themes that make this movie resonant all the way to today. Stallone does a powerful performance, as Rambo evokes compassion from the audience making us sympathetic to the suffering of Vietnam vets, not much dialogue as Stallone relies on body language and a final monologue that shows Stallone at his best. Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle also steals the show as an abusive and quite determined cop who risks everything to stop Rambo from destroying his town. Richard Crenna shines even more in a role that allows for sympathy to Rambo and a smart ass character that is always two steps ahead as Rambos former officer in the army. The film handles well the political themes surrounding Vietnam and brutally attacks the mistreatment of vietnam vets. Is full of suspense and action ala Predator  with strong characters and a great story.",

The main protagonist, played brilliantly by Sylvester Stallone, is a man who has given his whole life only to find out that he is not welcomed anymore in his home country.

While the movie does a good job of having an interesting character, I think it could have benefitted from a little more exposition or even a prequel of some sort giving more depth about who John Rambo is. Overall, it is an entertaining movie from the 80s that I think is easier to take more seriously than a lot of other action movies from that era.",

The one thing I like so much is how Rambo being in Vietnam had a huge effect on him in many ways including the he survives in the forest in the middle of the film and the the flashbacks he gets through out the film this is like a real soldier, in other films like Captain America or Wonder Woman they come out of wars cracking jokes but that's not realistic trauma is like baggage which you bring home.

            "content": "The legend of Rambo has gotten a bit out-of-hand over the last 35 years. Because of the cultural reputation and the obnoxiously bombastic sequels, he's often seen as the manliest of men, an archetype of the sweaty, bulging action stars of the 80s and 90s. It's a strange transformation, given where this character started. Sure, First Blood has its share of bad-to-the-bone bloody action. However, I think we forget that the movie ends with our hero breaking down on the floor of a police station, decrying the horrors of Vietnam and our treatment of those soldiers as they return home. We forget that this first Rambo is a well-directed, deeply soulful and honest post-war study that's as caring as it is thrilling.\nStallone's career has largely been defined by two characters: Rambo and Rocky, with the latter being the one he is most praised for and serves as proof he can do more than just throw a punch and shoot a machine gun. However, his turn as migrant war veteran John Rambo is as subtle and heartbreakingly unhinged as you could want. Sure, you get the marquee moments of Rambo rigging R-rated-Kevin-McAlister type traps in the woods, but mostly you're watching a broken man learning how to live in a broken country, neither of whom recognize one another anymore.\nIt's a powerful statement on the psychological effects of war, made even more powerful because of it's seeming unlikely placement in a movie that promises (and often delivers on) macho action violence. First Blood is a thoughtful and gripping little adventure tale, that's easily the 2nd best 80s Christmas action movie; Mr. McClain is a tough guy to bring down.",

Of course, Sly gets great support from the rest of the cast, from Brian Dennehy as as the sheriff who pushes him too far to Richard Crenna as Col. Trautman, the man who made Rambo the killer he is.  Behind the camera, director Ted Kotcheff adapts the book fairly well, keeping to the themes while toning down Rambo (notice he only kills one person in self-defense).  That doesn't mean the acting isn't top notch, and holds up great when compared to some modern CGI action movies today.

First Blood is essentially a commentary on the state of American war veterans after they were withdrawn from Vietnam. They were largely neglected upon their return, and were often called \"baby killers\" for what the American citizens presumed was a part of their duties. It follows John J. Rambo, a Vietnam war veteran searching for one of his old comrades. Upon learning his fate, Rambo walks through a small town in Washington state, and crosses paths with a vicious and hateful sheriff. One thing leads to another, and Rambo is being chased by local police, state police, and The National Guard. Leading this pack is his old colonel, Sam Trautman: the only man with a chance of saving the armed forces from Rambo. The tension that builds between Rambo and the police department in the first act sets the stage for a nail biting action film. Stallone performed almost all of the stunts, including one in which he jumps off a cliff and is halted by a series of branches. It was during this sequence that Stallone actually broke his ribs. The finale contains one of my favorite movie monologues ever, and it's delivered with such strong emotion and heart; this is direct evidence that Stallone can not only look the part, but he can play the part as well. First Blood is one of the best action movies ever made, and it's elevated by Stallone's versatile and all-in performance. When Rambo meets the sheriff again face-to-face, he tells him \"in town you're the law, but out here it's me.\" The same can be said about his abilities as an actor, and he has every right to say it off camera as he does on camera.",

Distraught, Rambo continues to travel, wandering into the small town of Hope, Washington. He is intercepted by the town's Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who considers him an unwanted nuisance. When Rambo asks for directions to a diner, Teasle drives him out of town and tells him not to return. Rambo returns anyway, so Teasle arrests him on charges of vagrancy, resisting arrest, and possessing a concealed knife. Led by chief deputy Art Galt, Teasle's officers abuse Rambo, triggering flashbacks of the torture he endured as a POW in Vietnam. When they try to dry-shave him with a straight razor, Rambo overwhelms the police, fights his way outside, and flees into the woods. A furious Teasle organizes a search party-complete with automatic weapons, dogs, and a helicopter-to recapture him. During the search, it is learned that Rambo is a former Green Beret who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his service. Galt spots Rambo and resorts to lethal force in defiance of orders, attempting to shoot Rambo from the helicopter. Trapped on a high cliff over a creek, Rambo leaps into a tree to break his fall, injuring himself in the process. Galt leans out of the helicopter, trying to shoot Rambo, who is hiding behind a tree. Rambo throws a rock which fractures the helicopter's windshield; the pilot's sudden reaction causes Galt to lose his balance and fall out of the helicopter to his death. Rambo attempts to persuade Teasle and his men that it was an accident and that he wants no more trouble, but the police open fire and pursue him into a wooded area. Rambo disables the deputies non-lethally one by one using his combat skills, until only Teasle is left. Holding a knife to his throat, Rambo threatens to fight back much harder if Teasle doesn't \"let it go,\" giving him a war that he won't believe. Teasle chooses to press the issue, and the state police and national guard are called in to assist in the manhunt. At the same time, Rambo's mentor and former commanding officer, Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives. Warning of his former soldier's abilities, Trautman advises that Rambo be given a gap to slip through so he can be recaptured more safely later. Confident that Rambo is hopelessly outnumbered, Teasle refuses...\n\n\"First Blood\" is a 1982 American action adventure film directed by Ted Kotcheff. It was co-written by and starred Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo. It is based on David Morrell's 1972 novel of the same name and is the first installment of the Rambo series. The film was released in the United States on October 22, 1982. Despite initial mixed reviews, the film was a box office success, grossing $47.2 million at the box office. Since its release, First Blood has received reappraisal from critics, with many praising the roles of Stallone, Dennehy, and Crenna, and recognizing it as an influential film in the action genre. It has also become a cult film. The film's success spawned a franchise, consisting of three sequels (all of which were co-written by and starred Stallone), an animated series, comic books, novels, and a Bollywood remake. A fifth film, tentatively titled Rambo: Last Stand, was cancelled in January 2016 when Stallone stated that he was retiring the character. First Blood originally received generally mixed reviews, with several critics noting that the plot lacks any sense of credibility. Variety called the film \"a mess\" and criticized its ending for not providing a proper resolution for the main character. More recently, Leonard Maltin gave the film one-and a half stars out of four, saying that it \"throws all creditability to the winds about the time [Rambo] gets off with only a bad cut after jumping from a mountain into some jagged rocks.\" The film's three lead actors received much praise for their performances. In his review, Roger Ebert wrote that he did not like the film's ending, but that it was \"a very good movie, well-paced, and well-acted not only by Stallone... but also by Crenna and Brian Dennehy\". He commented, \"although almost all of First Blood is implausible, because it's Stallone on the screen, we'll buy it\", and rated the film three out of four stars. In 2000, BBC film critic Almar Haflidason noted that Stallone's training in survival skills and hand-to-hand combat gave the film \"a raw and authentic edge that excited the audiences of the time\". James Berardinelli of ReelViews called the film \"a tense and effective piece of filmmaking\". He noted that the film's darker tone, somber subtext, and non-exploitative violence allowed the viewer to enjoy the film not only as an action/thriller but as something with a degree of intelligence and substance. On Stallone's performance, he wrote \"it seems impossible to imagine anyone other than Stallone in the part, and his capabilities as an actor should not be dismissed\".\n\nThis is the first time we get to see the character John Rambo on the screen and I remember vividly how I thought this was a good and different action movie back in the early 80s as a teenager. The character is more believable here compared to how Stallone developed the character later on. Here he is a Vietnam vet haunted by his memories of what he experienced in the Vietnam war and the emotional layers are strong and thought worthy. Yes, the character does carry some \"overpowers\" here as well, but not so it feels too over the top as it does in the sequel \"Rambo - First Blood II\". Sylvester Stallone plays the character in a convincing way and doesn\u00b4t become just some super action figure in this first part. The violence in the film is graphic but not overbearing or comic book like. I reckon \"realistic\" in many ways. It\u00b4s easy to sympathise with John Rambo as he is merely a man who is trying to get by haunted by what he became as a Green Beret and the horrifying experiences he had to endure in the Vietnam war. He doesn\u00b4t want any trouble, he just wants to be left alone. But, society keeps pushing him and when push comes to shove John Rambo gives Teasle a war that he won't believe. Rambo doesn\u00b4t kill anyone with purpose and the killing of Galt is accidental. The drama and the ensemble with Stallone, Crenna and Dennehy works very well and Ted Koetscheff\u00b4s direction is dynamic in some ways and uses the beautiful environments and sceneries in a proper manner. \"First Blood\" is yes maybe not the best action movie ever made, but yet it\u00b4s an ok action film from the 80s with some interesting emotional layers. \n\nTrivia: The first rough cut was over three hours, possibly three and a half hours long and according to Sylvester Stallone, it was so bad that it made him and his agent sick. Stallone wanted to buy the movie and destroy it thinking that it was a career killer. After heavy re-editing, the film was cut down to 93 minutes; this version was ultimately released in theatres.\n\n\"First Blood\" was Sylvester Stallone's first non-Rocky movie which didn't bomb. In fact, it arguably saved his career.",

Sylvester Stallone has serious acting chops in this movie. You see John Rambo as the gears shift in his head constantly as the situation he's in gets worse. The monologue where he breaks down is probably the most emotional an action hero has been, and above all may seem personal to a lot of those who served.

Stallone does some real acting here and the action is, at times, over the top, but mostly it doesn't take away from the story.  It does get a bit sillier in the third act, and Stallone's monologue at the end is legendary for being almost impossible to understand.  However, where Rambo, First Blood Part II requires that you turn off your brain and enjoy the mind-numbing violence.  First Blood actually has a decent story, characters and some acting, even from Stallone.  A decent early 80's actioner and easily the best of the series, although die-hard Rambo fans will probably argue that Part II is better.

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and how badly Vietnam vets were treated when they returned home are covered, but not in much depth.

Plus it is short and sweet so contains little filler, just as most action films should be.

But what I really like is the action.  There is lots of great, clever action in \"First Blood\", but it pulls off the action without any fancy effects.  I also enjoyed the performances of the three main cast members; Sylvester Stallone, Brian Dennehy, and Richard Crenna.  That said, Stallone doesn't have many lines, so his job isn't too hard.\n\nJohn Rambo is a cool character.  He does some pretty cool things in this film and he's a character that's easy to root for.

His performance is very mannered, but that means that he delivers his lines perfectly.

At the police station, the officers treat him similar to the way he was treated in Vietnam,causing him to freak out, flee custody, and hide out into the mountains, forcing him to build traps and battle the police department while they try to capture him. The film was nothing close to what its later sequels ended up becoming, nonstop action romps lacking character development, good acting, writing, direction, and appeal towards fans of the first film. This film is actually a very complex, action film with a healthy blend of action and complex character study, giving audiences something to watch as it isn't just nonstop action and no plot. The film paint a complex portrait of its main protagonist Rambo as a psychologically damaged man due to his experiences in Vietnam, which include comrades being killed or severely injured, being tortured by the Vietnamese soldiers, and being mistreated by others. Thee is also other complex characters, like main antagonist Will Teasle, an arrogant sheriff who strongly dislikes drifters, which is why the reason why he arrests Rambo (was drifting into Hope, Washington), and becomes intent on killing Rambo after head deputy Art Gald is killed by Rambo. Another layered character is Colonel Sam Trautman, a soldier flown to Hope, Washington in order to persuade Rambo to surrender. The film allows a dark tone and a good amount of depth into the story, but still offer up great action sequences, especially near the end with a few explosions and heavy damage with an M60, but most of the action happens in the woods, where there's lots of police officers dying, traps set by Rambo setting off, and dodging heavy ambushes and bullets. Michael Kozoll, William Sakheim, and Sylvester Stallone offer audiences complex characters, and shocking moments throughout. Ted Kotcheff offer audiences heavy violence, disturbingly believable performances, perfect action sequences, and flawless execution. The main cast is perfect, especially the three main leads Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, and Brian Dennehy. A must-see for action fans, and one of the most engaging action movies ever.",

            "content": "Grade:Lower 7/10\n\nFirst Blood is an action film that not only has scenes with purely well\nmade well action, but also a performance from an actor we don't always\nsee the best of. With it's quiet feel the film can really jump into\nlife at any moment and you won't find many films that can pull this\nkind of thing off and still keep you entertained until the last few\nmoments. I felt First Blood was a solidly pretty good action movie, and\nhere is why below.\n\nThe story is thrilling yet has a slight dramatic depth to it to say\nthat most of these type plots usually end up all guns blazing and\ndeaths constantly. This film manages to avoid the over the top amount\nof kills and settles for a slow pace that really does work. I\nespecially liked the start when Rambo is pushed over the edge\nemotionally, it brings the whole film to a thrilling start and even the\nmost hardened veterans of action films will still feel their heart\nbeating faster.\n\nSylvester Stallone is an actor that many times is criticised, but here\nhe is at his near full best, doesn't talk an awful lot but his emotion\ncarries and you really start to feel for what he says(well, if you can\nat times make it out). I liked Richard Crenna and his calm demeanour in\nthe film, even in the most dangerous of times he still seems to keep a\nstraight face and mind and the actor really knows how to make himself\nlook like a father figure.\n\nIt is directed quite well and same goes for the writing, Ted Kotcheff I\nfeel maybe didn't need to do much in scenes as Stallone just knows it\nall anyway but is hand is steady throughout the movie. Stallone is\namong the writers and he does well too, although with the 3 and the\ndialogues sometimes kept at a minimum, it is easy to see just how easy\nthis was to write really. I liked some stunts but I felt more was\nneeded in that area and more things like big jumps and run chases would\nhave been appreciated as well.\n\nMy main critical points focus on the slightly dull dialogue and parts\nseem a bit rushed in honesty, it doesn't hurt the film badly as I have\nalready said, it is a pretty good movie, but it definitely makes some\nscenes seem rubbishy. I wasn't too keen either on the way the film has\nto keep pointing out Stallone is hard to kill and a seasoned veteran,\nit got on my nerves because we hear it 20 times when Richard Crenna\narrives, and even more after just a few minutes.\n\nI think those who love good action and a story pieced together actually\nquite well, you will enjoy it, has a good back story but also doesn't\nfocus too much in the past, stays in the present story. If you like\nmassive explosions and car chases etc, this may not be for you really,\nlacks in that department but if it had them in the film, it would have\nruined it and made it so much more unrealistic and rubbish.\n\nOverall I give it a lower 7/10, it is Solidly Good and although not quite\nstraight good, still is moving there by the end. It just needed a\nlittle more time I feel and it could have rated even higher, worth a\nwatch though for anyone who likes film. One more thing, if you like\nStallone and his many movies that include fighting and shooting etc,\nyou should have a blast with this, this could be Stallone's best action\nthriller film he has ever done(and he does a lot of them), a great\nwatch for you guys and with so many sequels too, why not watch it.",

Fighting as the military guerrilla he was trained to be he fights police in the wooded hills and finally in the small town itself.  It has some great scenes, a great plot, and a classic 1980s feel.  One of my favorite scenes is when he rambles on crying in the police building about Vietnam and how his friends died and how he's the only one left.  He is of course overly herioc, he should have died more than once and some things are of course impossable, that's what Rambo movies are all about, and at least they're done in a good way.

Sheriff Will Teasle tells John Rambo as he escorts him out of town for no good reason. Little did he know he was messing with a ticking time bomb. Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone) is a Vietnam war veteran who, shortly into the film, learns he is the last remaining of his friends from the same unit in the war. After being mistreated by the local police force of the fictional town Hope, Washington, Rambo, tortured by flashbacks of his time as a prisoner of war, finally snaps raises hell on the once peaceful town.\n\nWhat Rambo: First Blood gets right is the action. Guns, knifes, helicopters, explosions and even jungle booby-traps. It's exciting. What Rambo: First Blood doesn't get quite as right is the script. The story starts off strong but slowly takes a back seat and becomes as bare as it can be for the action to carry the rest of the film. When Rambo is placed under arrest and taken to the police station early in the film we witness him being the victim of unfair treatment which in turn results in memories from his troubled past. I feel they could have developed his character better with more of these flashbacks and even full length scenes to see his relationship with his war friends and truly understand the reasons for his extreme actions.\n\nThe film features a chase scene early on where Sheriff Deputy Will Teasle is driving after Rambo who has stolen a motorcycle. It was an exciting chase scene that slowly turns from a chase on the roads to a muddy off-road scramble. I keep referring to this movie as exciting and that's really the best way I can describe it. It's consistent with it's action and at 93 minutes long, it's just the right length.

First Blood has a lot more to offer, and asks the audience to consider the poor treatment of veterans returning home after years fighting in Vietnam.\n\nAs Rambo, Sylvester Stallone is perfectly cast. Credible as an ex-green beret as he throws himself physically into the part, and believable as a haunted Vietnam veteran mentally scarred after many years at war. Brian Dennehy is also good as Teasle, the xenophobic small town sheriff who takes on more than he can handle when he pushes Rambo too far. Richard Crenna as Colonel Trautman is really the only weak link in the cast. Not so believable as the commanding officer that supposedly trained Rambo, and nearly every line of dialog he had is delivered with all the weight and emotional resonance of a movie poster tag-line.\n\nWith the beautiful Golden Ear provincial park in British Columbia as backdrop, the movie looks amazing. Jerry Goldsmith's score also adds a great dramatic tone to the film. The action is well staged, and never becomes over the top or cartoonish. It's violent, but in a controlled way that serves the story rather than try to dazzle or shock the audience. First Blood is a true action classic.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you're looking for mindless over the top action nonsense, this movie isn't for you. If you like your action films to be a little more than a huge pyrotechnic fireworks display, give this a viewing. You won't be disappointed.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe British Columbia back drop is fantastic, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is superb. If a screening was available at a theater near you then I suggest you take advantage. At home, a HD viewing brings out the best in this film.\n\nBest elements for me:\n\nStallone's performance and Jerry Goldsmith's score.\n\nwww.TalkieGazette.com",

            "content": "Sylvester Stallone is RAMBO. There is no one else that could play him. Just like Harrison Ford embodies Indiana Jones and Bruce Willis is John McClane, Stallone is about as good as he has ever been here. He is quiet, he is strong and his physicality creates a character that many of us can empathize with and eventually root for. David Morell wrote a different character in his book but Stallone paints him more as a sympathetic character. He is correct in doing so. While Morell's vision is still present, this is more of Stallone's creation. Rambo is about as unique a character present in film history.\n\nFirst Blood is a film released in 1982, but in my opinion it set a new standard for action film stars. I think James Bond was pretty much your standard action film star before that. He was smooth and debonair and nothing went wrong for him. Rambo, at least in First Blood, is realistic. He bleeds, he cries, and he wears his emotion on his sleeve. This is someone that many of us could and can relate to. The sequels made him larger than life and that is fine, but this small film done by the Carolco guys is about as perfect a film as you can get.",

It is has larger than life action but still exhibits tasteful restraint and does not get obnoxiously carried away. John Rambo is noticeably withdrawn, but he still has humanistic qualities that build empathy and make him easily identifiable. Sylvester Stallone plays the part perfectly and is more than just a meathead. He displays strong emotion and conveys a great deal of substance in his physical and facial acting. When he opens up in the memorable the final scene, his frustration and emotion are powerful. As an action movie it is top notch, but what elevates it to the next level is how it confronts the viewer with a poignant social issue and ethical dilemma. This movie raises questions about what happens to a human mind when it is trained to kill and experiences unspeakably atrocities during war. Furthermore, this movie points out how the psychological scars of war can make it very difficult to integrate back in with normal society. It shows how brave soldiers, particularly during the Vietnam War, are often condemned, criticized, and ostracized when they return, from war rather than being greeted with compassion, respect, and gratitude.",

He plays a former Green Beret who recently got back from the war, it delves into the aspect of how the people who went away to fight for our country were treated upon return. The outcome is a gritty and somber reality of how these men were treated. The whole story is a shot on the people who reacted this way to the soldiers and Sylvester Stallone brings it all together. He just wants to get by in a town while passing through on his way, but some cops take him in for no reason and has flashbacks of Vietnam and snaps.The rest of the movie is his trek for survival and to just make it out alive. The movie is just full of action and great moments. I will also say that Stallone's monologue at the end is just incredible and packed with emotion, definitely worth the price of admission, check it out.",

A drifter walks into Small Town USA, he's unwanted by the local lawmen, and is pretty much thrown out of the town (just for being a 'nam vet?). First raised eyebrow. Then again that might just be the generation gap and me not understanding something before my time. After being dropped off at the city limits he turns back around into town. Understandable, he's has the right to get a bite to eat and a good nights rest wherever he pleases. So he is arrested for no real reason, treated very poor the entire time making him uncooperative  (understandably so), escapes, then the lawmen try to get him back. It all seems very simple but  the drastic measures taken to get this guy back into custody  is what came close to losing me. Then we have a nice long game of cat and mouse which to be fair was a fun watch. However, of course the State Troopers and the National Guard can't get this guy.  Watching Rambo out due these clowns wasn't all that thrilling to me. Yes the action was still good and Stallone is at the top of his game, but there is no real suspense, no challenge. He is finally caught thanks to his former superior officer. Then we see one of -the- top tier action leads of all time, in one his most iconic testosterone fulled roles, brake down. And in near tears talks about how he has been mistreated by his fellow Americans since he's been home. And though it was bad over there, he still found -some- good in it between his brothers in arms and getting to do what he does best. Where as back home all there he has to look forward to is abuse. He USE to be a hero but now he can't even hold down a job. We see this actor who is so often made fun for his lack of depth give a pretty stellar performance. Kudos.",

It won me over due to Slyvester Stallone's viciousness.  I know I said that Die Hard would seem formulaic if it came out today, but this film is more than a action film.  It is a war.  Sly is pitted in a fight for his life.  We also explore the mind of John Rambo.  Not literally, but we see how cold, distant he is.  Sly captures it perfectly.  It deserves higher than an 87%.  It deserves a 96%.\r\n\r\nStory wise it is pretty simple: John Rambo, a hitchhiker, is not invited to town by the sheriff.  The sheriff gives him one chance to leave.  Rambo walks back and is arrested.  Soon, he escapes and the police hunt for him.  It is simple, sweet, and surprisingly original.  The film then becomes a war film.  Scenes in the forest are similar to the backdrops in Vietnam.  As Rambo sets traps, you realize how much of a killing machine he is.  \r\n\r\nActing wise the film is mostly centered around Rambo.  The sheriff does most of the dialogue, though.  Everyone is good.  I have no complaints although the acting seems a bit dated.  Like it has that corny 80s vibe in so many films.
