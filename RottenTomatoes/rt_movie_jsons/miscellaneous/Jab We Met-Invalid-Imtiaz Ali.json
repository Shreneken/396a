            "content": "Imtiaz Ali's Magnum Opus\n\nI know I know there are better Imtiaz Ali films out there including the likes of Tamasha and most notably Highway, but you see, what I'm talking about here is not his best film, but it's certainly his magnum opus. to let you know the difference, magnum opus is something that is a large and important work of art, music or literature which is regarded as the artist's most important. Not necessarily the best, but most important. So, sure Highway might be Imtiaz Ali's best film, but Jab We Met just speaks to me in a different way.\n\nRight from the start, this film drags you in. The opening montage of Aditya Kashyap just leaving everything behind and giving up on life is something I relate to on a huge, personal level. I too sometimes feel like just disappearing from everyone's life out of the blue and wanting to be left alone. It gives off a vibe that this might be a depressing, slow-moving film about Aditya's journey of self-discovery and coming to terms with various stages of his past life. Although that does happen, it doesn't quite happen in a way you'd expect things to happen. Right after the opening montage, we are introduced to Geet Kaur Dhillon. A character which is the polar opposite of Aditya and that's when you think that it is through Geet, that Aditya will finally learn about the value of life. Although, that also does happen, it does not just end there, it's actually only the first half of the film. The film transitions into something much more beautiful and emotional in the second half which shows what an amazing writer-director Imtiaz Ali truly is. After the first half, the situations are reversed and the tables are turned. It is now Geet that is facing what Aditya was facing in the first half and now it's Aditya's duty to help Geet learn about the value of life. This unique dynamic along with exceptional work from the leads is what makes this film work. The energy of the leads is so beautiful that they don't miss a beat in connecting with the audience and land a gut-wrenching powerful punch when the time comes. I was crying through most of the middle section of the film to witness all the situations reversed and seeing Aditya encouraging Geet to live again melts my heart.\n\nThe performances from the leads are absolutely fantastic. There is not a single loose thread in the acting and considering Shahid and Kareena were an actual couple back then, it really shows. Their chemistry is off the charts and you desperately want them to end up being together. Tarun Arora as Anshuman is also something that works really well. You'd think of him as that regular trope-filled character of a rom-com which is there just to act as an obstacle before the two leads end up together but he is so much more. His character has an actual stake in the film and his actions have some serious plot-thickening consequences. Which is what makes him different and unique. Although, whatever fate his character met, he deserved it. The rest of the cast is also good and provide ample support to the leads.\n\nThe music and background score oof. This is where the film excels again. Each and every track is soulful and eargasmic. Be it the romantic Tum Se Hi by Mohit Chauhan, heartbreaking Aaoge Jab Tum by Ustad Rashid Khan, the absolute banger party songs Nagada Nagada by Javed Ali/Mauja Hi Mauja by Mika Singh or the go-to vibe filled Yeh Ishq Haaye by Shreya Ghoshal; each and every song is great and contributes to the film in high values.\n\nIn the end, I'd like to say again what I said in the beginning. This film is indeed, Imtiaz Ali's Magnum Opus.",

            "content": "First of all let's get my pet peeve over with. Jab We Met, seriously? Like what, you met each other and then gave each other a jab? It should have been Jub We Met. With that said, Jab We Met was one of the first films that I watched after we got our TV. There are many things I like about this film and there are many that I don't. My mom really liked this film and had told us to watch it too. I wasn't really into watching films since I was at the age of watching cartoons (and since the TV had just come, I was more interested in the cartoons). And so I watched it, and it's pretty mediocre.\nJab We Met is a character driven, light hearted film. The story moves with the characters. So here we have two characters. Aditya is a software engineer or a singer (I have no idea what he was) who is very depressed and got on a train because he wanted to commit suicide. Geet is a happy go lucky woman who is about to get married in Bhatinda. She is constantly trying to talk to him with many jump cuts from the same camera angle. Finally she misses the train and decides to take Aditya with himself. They both go to Bhatinda, where Manjeet is about to marry Geet.\nBut Geet and Aditya run away from home because Geet loves someone else who basically ignored her. So afterwards their situations exchange. Now Geet is depressed and Aditya is happy. But since she ran from home, her family gets Aditya and tells him to find her so that she comes back home and gets married to Manjeet. But when they are back, Geet asks Aditya if Manjeet is looking at them and when Aditya says he is, she hugs him. And that's why their marriage is called off. Because friends never hug each other, especially not in 2007.\nThe film is funny, though the acting, choreography, story are all terrible. It's one of those films that you would keep your mind away while watching. It's like a Govinda film for an educated audience. The fact that a film like Jab We Met is considered so good and nostalgic clearly shows how bad Bollywood is. In order to create memories we have to compromise on such a mediocre, senseless film. Nowadays we have many films like these, but this is what will live on with us because it was one of the first films to give us a taste of this genre.",
