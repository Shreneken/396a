It is a rousing Indian patriotic film which gets your heart thumping. The movie got stunning cinematography, good dialogues and is well paced. The action does become unrealistic at times with the hero doing impractical one on one combat, but overall the fight choreography looks modern and smart delivering us explosive scenes. The casting is superb, Vicky Kaushal shines in the lead and so does the supporting cast. It does feel like a propaganda film, and I feel there is nothing wrong about that.\n \nPS: It is one of those movies were the best parts are shown in the trailer itself.",

            "content": "Uri: The Surgical Strikes is a taut thriller based on the real surgical strikes against terror camps based in Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir. \n\nIt is technically superior to almost any other Indian war movie made to date (Parmanu & Madras Cafe weren't strictly war movies). Some creative liberties have been taken, as is to be expected in a movie, and the action could have been better choreographed - though some of the hand-to-hand combat is superbly donw - but overall the fighting scenes take you right in the middle. \n\nMovies like these are much-needed. It doesn't rationalize, doesn't sympathize with terrorism or terrorists. Is not apologetic about our soldiers. Celebrates their incredible bravery.\n\nIs it a propaganda movie? No. It would have become that much less effective had it tried to be a propaganda movie. Among real-life figures, it is Doval (played by Paresh Rawal) that the movie highlights rather than Modi. Your children need to, must, see the movie. A couple of scenes may be graphic, but no more than what kids are already exposed to. And yes, I guarantee you that there won't be a dry eye in the theater at one point.\n\nVicky Kaushal is excellent. Paresh Rawal nails it as the NSA, Ajit Doval. Rajit Kapoor plays Modi in very subdued shades, which actually work, since that keeps the focus on the action. Mohit Raina is terrific. Yami Gautam is there for the glamour Q. Swaroop Sampat is poignant. Rakesh Bedi is brilliant in a short cameo. And the little girl will break your heart.\n\nTo conclude, in the 40 or so years that I have memories of watching movies in theaters, this is the first time - EVER - that cries of \"Jai Hind\" & spontaneous applause rend the hall.",

The advent of a new age of visionary artists who were past the phase of concocting stories with heroes larger than their characters has finally led to justice. \nAditya Dhar's research on the Uri attacks must be thorough because there is no sensationalism to convince us about the events. Political agendas, media coverage and public sentiment are kept at subtle levels so as to keep the viewer engaged with the characters and their motivations. A fictional account of the operation and its preceding events it may well be but make no mistake; Uri showcases the Indian Army's tactical prowess and therefore, is a heavy action film. \n\n\tMajor Vihaan Shergill (Vicky Kaushal) has a proven track record of a successful surgical attack at the Myanmar border with his precise planning and execution. His ailing mother (Swaroop Sampat) keeps him posted in the Delhi headquarters, away from other action in Kashmir where his brother-in-law, Major Karan (Mohit Raina) is making the family proud. \nIt is easy to invest in these characters with the sincerity depicted by the actors and the viewer's acute sense of what is coming. The Mahadev actor Mohit Raina, especially creates an impact in a few scenes as he takes charge of the camp's defense against the terrorist attack. Sprinting across the screen, dodging bullets and determined to kill the attackers, we root for this army hero to save the day from devastation. The film's title makes a timely appearance at the end of this intensity only to stir you at the Army's memorial service for the fallen soldiers like no tragedy has since Rang de Basanti. The attack was especially personal for Major Vihaan who motivates his commandos with a powerful element apart from their extraordinary individual capabilities - Rage. The encounter during the surgical strike is a visceral manifestation of this anger that is accurate enough with one bullet but there is no hesitation to portray the ruthlessness with which they shoot each militant more than once. This is a different Indian army that is shaken to its core and will show no mercy.\n\tAs Paresh Rawal's Govind declares that with a surgical strike, a New India will tell the world that it is capable of not only entering enemy turf but also killing them on it, director Aditya Dhar's follow through on this bold statement is a far cry from the cliche, over-the-top dramatization of J.P. Dutta's army ventures. Precise to the point of the operation's planning, clinical in execution with exemplary cinematography, a tense and pulsating background score and the deployment of all modern arms and ammunition that support the valor of a spirited commando unit, Uri looks and feels like a Hollywood action film in its visual style and crisp editing.  \nIt is real, visceral, slick and engaging cinema that makes you respect the technical team that enabled it all. This is a no-nonsense retelling of the events that shook the nation and how the people in power made bold decisions to restore faith and pride in the citizens. \n\n\tThe performances by a competent cast are well confined to the tone and emotional depth of the characters in their situations. This is a critical area where a sound technical film can fall on its knees with miscasting and cliche performances but here, even a special appearance by Rakesh Bedi in an unusual role draws chuckles and not ridicule. Such is the impact of a fine cast that includes the likes of Paresh Rawal, Rajit Kapoor, Mohit Raina , Yami Gautam and the most credible Vicky Kaushal. \n\n\tAditya Dhar deserves a lot of praise for keeping it relevant to the new gen audience that now demands realism when depicting true events. Uri invokes patriotism without the usual chants and long speeches. It trades drama and hyperbole for surgical execution of a script that stays faithful to its topic. \nThe victory song during the end credits is a high voltage anthem featuring Daler Mehendi of course, because who else can better vocalize passionate patriotism.\n\n\t4.701 on a scale of 1-5.",

No new additions barring small perks.\nDirection-Direction is commendable. Chapter wise distribution picking every events from 1st to last surgical strike and putting it in a compact 2 hours thriller guarantees goosebumps.And i would have put it in the 2nd best but one thing that bothered me is sudden end of the shots.When the excitement is building he ended it hurriedly and went to the next shot.These new approach in a Indian war movies i think may have worked with the millennial.I think it gave the perfect amount of patriotism and emotion and cut off the cringes.\nOther things to notice-Though Aditya Dhar hit the every right spots of the audience by the rousing(many said jingoistic which i don't understand why the hell this word would have any meaning in a country which lacks patriotism in many region of the country) dialogues the silent expressions of every actors overpowered the the powerful dialogues.Which is a very good sign for Indian cinema.My rating is 5/5 10/10 99/100.",

The movie is constantly breakneck and exciting. However,Â  I think why the action scenes are so effective are because there is an actual emotional connection to the characters. The movie chooses to take time with the exposition and that allowed me, as the viewer, to really empathize in the moments where the stakes felt dangerously high. The performances are also very good and were pretty realistic. This is a first-rate movie that is worth checking out. January is a traditionally bad month for Hollywood releases, so I'm glad this Bollywood movie got me to have an engaging experience at the movie theater in a month where I generally avoid going.",
