            "content": "The story didn't fit with the 1940's setting, having the whole movie contained within one house makes it very awkward whenever a character yells (why can't they hear each other?) Keeping the Shakespearean dialogue in the new setting just feels out of place and very confusing. Hamlet just seems like he's sad & drunk throughout the entirety of the movie, and no one seems to have any character depth. \n\nI think if the story was adapted to fit the setting rather than just plopped into it, it would be significantly better.",
