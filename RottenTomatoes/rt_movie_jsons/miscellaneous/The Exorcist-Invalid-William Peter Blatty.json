Scott) notices similarities between his current murder investigation and the methods used by the \"Gemini\" killer (Brad Dourif) who was executed 15 years before. He soon discovers a hospitalized mental patient (Jason Miller) claiming to be the dead serial killer, but who looks uncannily like a priest Kinderman knew who died during an exorcism. As more bodies are found, Kinderman looks for connections between the two supposedly dead men.",

            "content": "This is a horror classic this movie I highly recommend to you for Halloween cause this movie is Erie and unsettling and has arguable the best jump scare in all of horror. This movie has very good acting, This movie has very good practical affects that just look amazing. I also love the story here it's very much a different Exorcist movie it's more of a murder mystery then a demon possessing someone's body although it has that it in it still have aspects the make so much of a different film from the rest of the movies in the series. And this might be very controversial but I think this movie is a little bit better then the original. I know it sounds crazy but that's just what I think that's how much I love this movie it's so cool and deserves to be in peoples lists of favorite horror sequels and movies. And lastly I think Brad Dourif should have gotten an Oscar for his performance he is the best part of this movie he brings so much emotion to his character and I think it is freaking great so yay I very much recommend The Exorcist III it is a very strong and worthy sequel to a down right terrifying horror movie that sparked the genera with possession horror movies so that's the end of my review and I really hope this will help you with what you will see that is a masterpiece of film making.",

Top-tier acting from George C. Scott and Brad Dourif, brilliant and minimalist music by Barry De Vorzon and astounding direction from Blatty with an atmosphere of unbearable dread and utter horror; also contains the single greatest (and only acceptable) jump-scare in film history. The Exorcist III is bloody horrifying in the best way possible and a worthy successor to the already frightening original.",

I have never seen the second Exorcist since I heard about it being so bad, but I feel like this is what the second movie or a sequel to the first one should've been like. George C Scott and Brad Dourif especially, and even Jason Miller, acted boldly and outstandingly. The directing style for a horror movie like this was stellar as well, and the shots and sequences worked very well. The two things that I can see someone having a problem with might be the slower beginning/pacing early on and the extensive monologging in a few scenes. Other than that, this is one of the better sequels I've seen and I think it deserves a much higher rating! It's just as good, if not even better, than the first one!",

Possessed by the Gemini serial killer is James Venamun ( Brad Dourif ) and both Dourif and Scott give outstanding performances squaring up to each other.\n\nWell known studio cuts made the film less violent and slightly different but even with the mandated changes \"The Exorcist 111\" is a well crafted suspense thriller. Very reminiscent of David Fincher's \"Zodiac\" in its pacing and investigative nature, this film is a very underrated sequel to the original masterpiece",

I\u2019m also not sure why they made George C Scott yell so intensely at times. It seemed so fake and forced. It just would have worked better as a crime thriller than an Exorcism film.

The scene stealer, though, is Brad Doriff in a brilliant turn as the Gemini Killer, who is both mesmerizing and terrifying in ever scene he owns.  Behind the camera, writer/director William Peter Blatty does a solid job adapting his novel, \"Legion\", along with keeping the tone and feel of the original \"Exorcist\".  He's no Friedkin, but delivers some nice scares (the hallway/nurse scene remains one of the greatest jump scares ever filmed).  However, his story is a bit confusing, especially in tying current events to the original movie.  Overall, a solid horror film and definitely worth checking out.",

This film had very little to do with the rite. The eventual exorcism scene was the worst thing I've ever watched and there was no character development of the exorcist priest either, he just showed up and got plastered to the ceiling. A serial killer movie at best. That being said it held my attention and I finished the film in the hope that something remotely related to exorcism would come into play. Sadly that aspect is seriously lacking and misleading by its title. The acting was ok, a bit washed down and humorous in places when it really didn't need to be. It was good to see the original Damien Karras in the film again and it was an interesting idea that he never truly died at the bottom of the infamous stairs. Overall, it was a film that kept interest out of the hope that it would uphold its promise as an exorcism movie, but ultimately its a let down.",

The Exorcist III is nearly as good as The Exorcist and every bit as engaging and emotional.\n\nBlatty's script is a shining star here as his writing is funny with silly jokes and gripping in his complex killer script. Blatty's screenplay is one of those remarkable scripts with heartfelt earnesty towards his characters and a thoughtful muder mystery with shocking supernatural turns. The idea that you avenge your dead friends is interesting in itself. I really like how Blatty conveys his creative ideas here in a visually intriguing way. The editing is insane with wild moments like the dream sequence. I think too much of the plot is explained by the outstanding performance from Brad Dourif, who steals every scene he's in here as a mad serial killer called The Gemini Killer.\n\nIt's too bad that the entire film is not complete as the superior director's cut that adds extra character moments has grainy VHS quality segments slapped together in there. The more flamboyant theatrical version is gorgeous and nicely remastered by the folks over at Scream Factory for anyone interested in a blu-ray of The Exorcist III. At least in the theatrical you get a cool cameo from Jason Miller from The Exorcist as Patient X.\n\nGeorge C. Scott goes out with a bang for his final major motion picture role for a real great feature. He admirably recreates the same vibe as Detective Kinderman as Lee J. Cobb brought to the role in The Exorcist. His emotionally devastated faces screwed in pain and eyes filled with tears is a neat change of pace for Scott's career. Scott contributes to acting again with a mature and nuanced acting performance in a loving endcap to a legendary career. George C. Scott adds a warmth and energy to every line that gives his detective a resonant realism.\n\nEd Flanders is so gentle and funny as the priest Father Dyer. I also enjoyed Nicol Williamson as Father Morning.\n\nScott Wilson is unnerving as a doctor that smokes and who is obsessed with the occult. Wilson's Dr. Temple is as odd as his encounters with Scott's understated detective.\n\nLastly, there are plenty of neat cameos in The Exorcist III including Teresa Wright, Fabio, Larry King, and even Samuel L. Jackson if you look hard enough.",

The style is so different than that of the documentary feel of the original and the contrast is so wide that it makes sense this wasn't initially meant to be a sequel. George C. Scott delivers a powerful performance of rage and determination and Brad Dourif plays the crazed serial killer with so much creepy energy you can't help but be on the edge of your seat when Kinderman confronts the Gemini Killer. This is also a rare example of studio interference helping the overall quality greatly as the original William Peter Blatty cut had an underwhelming ending when compared to the theatrical climax. Don't let the awful entry of Exorcist II: The Heretic fool you into not giving this a chance, it deserves it. Really don't know why Blatty didn't direct more, as this really isn't a critically panned film (nor is it praised though), he could've made more like this.

I love it. It hasn't very off putting direction with its inductive approach to a lot of scenes to make you feel uneasy with its main character. And speaking of that main character, he is, as far as I'm concerned, the perfect protagonist for this type of movie. He's damaged and so out of his element with the sinister events going on and it makes for an incredibly interesting journey to see his character grow. The film does get a little messy with what it wants to focus on at times and the introduction in the third act to the possession subplot does feel out of left field a bit but I still think this movie is so much better than a third exorcist film has any right to be and is probably one of the most underrated sequels of all time.",

This is what I call sluggish film that you'll need a lot of patience to get to the good stuff. Well, the whole movie is kind of like that. Every time I think something is going to progress with the story it jumps right back. Luckily it doesn't do that too often and it's only for build up (i guess).\n\nBut it's not to say that \"The Exorcist III\" doesn't have it's scary parts, because it really dose. There's moments that are so eerie and quite shocking that the movie quickly cuts away to next scene so you don't even have a reaction or a thought of what you just seen. The movie takes a few minutes of silence as the scene plays on and then BOOM! And this actually did get to me. A great example of this is the Nurse scene which is one of the scariest scenes in movie history. During the scene you really don't get a sense of damage, but more of a safe feeling as every thing seems to be alright, until the horror kicks in. And I know that sounds very similar to every horror movie that use it's scars, but I think those movies get it completely wrong of how to make the build up and the scare executed in a way that it's effective. I think this is something that's missing in horror today.\n\nBrad Douriff is in this movie playing The Gemini killer and he's freaking amazing. This is one of the best performances I've seen from Douriff and it just proves of how talented this guy truly is. I would go as far to say it's Oscar worthy and he isn't in the movie that much. He's so creepy and frightening that he steals the show.\n\nBut the actor that I thought was going to steal the show was George C. Scott, which is sadly not the case. He's a great actor and he was excellent in \"Patton\", but I found he's performance in this to be a bit over the top. I mean, I don't think he was RAZZIE worthy bad or anything, but he over reacted in the wrong parts. It came off a bit laughable. It's until the very end when he gets to shine as he's really giving it he's all. I give him that.\n\nThe interesting thing I found out about the movie (after i finished watching it) was that the author of the book William Peter Blatty wrote & directed this. You know when you hear people complaint that when a movie adaptation isn't as accurate to the novel it's based on. Well, it's kinda refreshing (to me) for an author to make the movie that he wanted to see. And I can say that he exceed in a few parts even if the whole thing feels a bit disjointed, and that goes to the writing.\n\nOverall rating: \"The Exorcist III\" while not great, but at least gets back to it's roots of having a dark and unsettling atmosphere, something that was missing in \"Exorcist II\". The movie is honestly worth watching just for Brad Douriff performance.",

The story is set 15 years after the incidents in the first Exorcist movie and we follow Father Dyer and lieutenant Kinderman. We find out that during the first movie's story, there was also a killer called Gemini killer working the streets and he killed all his victims in the same way, now 15 years later, people end up dead in the same way they did 15 years ago which leads Kinderman to believe that the Gemini killer isn't dead. I won't spoil anything more as this movie has quite a lot to offer. First of all, this movie is actually creepy and disturbing at times, unlike the godawful The Heretic. Secondly, it's interesting and intense. Last, but certainly not the least, it's good. It's an actually good sequel to a brilliant movie. I did not expect this movie to be good after having seen The Heretic, but I'm glad I was wrong. The director of the movie is William Peter Blatty, who is also the person who wrote the book The Exorcist and the script for the first movie, which is also a clue that this movie is not bad. I loved everything about how this movie looked, the visual style was awesome! The acting was great, except at times where Kinderman was shouting, it sounded way too fake and it actually cracked me up. What I loved the most about this movie was that, besides being a horror movie, it was also a mystery/thriller movie with an actual murder case that was entertaining to figure out. There are a few things with the movie that I don't completely understand, but it's way more comprehensible than The Heretic. There are a lot of disturbing and creepy scenes, my favourites are when you see someone confessing their sins, we never get to see who it is, and it starts out normal, but then it gets extreme and you're just sitting there thinking \"Holy crap, that got me\" and the famous hospital hallway scene which I had seen before online, but it was just as scary even though I knew what would happen. All in all, a very good horror/mystery movie with great creepy moments, remarkable camera work and a story that's interesting and intense, albeit a bit far-fetched. I would highly recommend seeing this movie after having seen The Exorcist, forget that The Heretic even exists.",

The movie industry has us trained to expect the predictable and when we're shown something new we react defensively like a territorial animal.

Obviously, because it's not The Exorcist.

If most if not all award shows didn't ignore horror films, I don't see any reason why Brad Dourif wouldn't have gotten at least a best supporting actor nom for this. He carries so much of this film in his portrayal of the Gemini Killer. Just a great film. Even though the studio went behind Blatty's back and re shot the whole last third of the film, it's still good. Hopefully that \"lost\" footage surfaces and Blatty can make the cut he intended.",

Aside from a studio imposed ending with the typical exorcism histrionics (including holy water, flashing lights and visual effects) this is smart and mostly simply dramatically charged stuff with little gore or typical cheap horror flash. Although that's not to say there arnt some stand out scary set pieces, the now infamous Nurse Station scene is masterful and of course there's the old lady on the ceiling which is nightmarish as hell, and the overall direction makes you wish that Exorcist Author turned director William Peter Blatty had made more films.

Yeah, this isn't really all that much of an \"Exorcist\" film, so much so that it was supposed to be titled \"Legion\", but they had to change it for marketability's reason, you know, \"seeing as how George C. Scott isn't going to be enough to sell a movie\". I express sarcasm and all, but apparently neither Scott nor the title change could quite get this commercially promising project to make it to the $40 million mark, so it's a good thing that they saved money by having this be something of a passion project for William Peter Blatty. That's right, horror hooligans, this film is written and directed by none other than the author of the original novel \"The Exorcist\"...- oh, and, uh, \"Legion\", the book upon which this film is based, just in case you care at all. Apparently the other people behind this film didn't figure that you cared, because, again, they went so far as to change the title \"Legion\" to \"The Exorcist III\", and even incorporate exorcism plot elements that weren't even in the book... \"which isn't to say that the name of Blatty, a very under-experienced filmmaker, was some other kind of a marketing scheme at all\". It's hard to convey sarcasm in text form, especially when the sarcasm is ironically disingenuous, because it does feel like Blatty has his heart in this, it's just that the final product isn't quite what folks were expecting... \"seeing as how 'Exorcism II: The Heretic' raised such a high standard for sequels of 'The Exorcist'\". Yeah, shut up, I liked \"The Heretic\" just fine, but if we can put that and sarcasm aside, this film is decent and all, but its marketing is hardly its most questionable attribute.\r\n\r\n\"The Heretic\" seemed to be a fluffier answer to something as audacious as \"The Exorcist\", but relative lightheartedness hardly ended with this film's predecessor, with this film suffering from tonal unevenness that perhaps would have been more all over the place if William Peter Blatty, as director, wasn't more realized in his atmospheric effectiveness, yet nonetheless has a tendency to undercut tension with too much fluff, much of which doesn't even hit home by its own right, at least not in way it wants to. There are some unintentionally amusing cheesy moments in this film, which is certainly not as cheesy as the still decent \"The Heretic\", but distances you with a touch too much fluffiness at times, and further distances with yet more incoherency, this time in pacing. As good as \"The Exorcist\" is, it gets to be a little slow, and what helped greatly in getting \"The Heretic\" by as decent was entertainment value, in spite of some slow spells, so with the first two installments, alone, this series seemed like it was steadily getting less slow, and sure enough, this installment is hardly dry, but pacing problems that atmospheric cold spells could have stressed still stand, with the biggest pacing issue being the usual one: dragging, achieved through repetitiously meandering material, if not filler, that drags the narrative just about into aimlessness. The limited focus of this meandering thriller creates some pretty questionable pacing problems, and some rushes over characterization don't exactly help, so pacing seems to be enough to overwhelm the film with underwhelmingness, and yet, just for good measure, the film is sure to meander down a familiar path. I don't necessarily mean that this story is familiar in the way many might think, because in a lot of ways, this is barely an \"Exorcist\" film, yet Blatty makes it up to horror fans by hitting plenty of conventions from other thrillers, so much so that predictability eventually forms, reflecting a certain laziness, which is ironic, considering that shortcomings are made all the more glaring by palpable ambition. Blatty wants to really hit with this film, and I can't blame him, because this is a promising project, and one whose execution works in a lot of ways, but sadly can't overcome its own demons enough to fall short as a formulaic and uneven thriller. That being said, this is still a more worthy follow-up to \"The Exorcist\" than \"The Heretic\", and like I've been saying, I didn't even mind \"The Heretic\", so sure enough, this isn't too shabby of a thriller, not is it too shabby of an idea.\r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, this film strays quite a ways away from the subject matter of William Peter Blatty's strong story concept for \"The Exorcist\", and it's a little too conformist to conventions of other thriller mythologies, but the concept behind this particular film is perhaps stronger than the final product itself, because as a mystery thriller, this effort has some thoroughly intriguing elements, flavored up by dramatic depth, and as a supernatural thriller, many elements added especially for this adaptation of \"Legion\" feel kind of forced, but come with their own intriguing ambiguities that all but haunt, at least on paper. Like I said, this film stands to be stronger, but the final product isn't so messy that you can't see the potential within this subject matter, which is considerable, and often done a fair deal of justice, even by something as light-seeming as style. Now, when I say that style seems light as a compliment to this thriller's effectiveness, I don't simply mean that stylistic effectiveness is limited, I mean that style isn't that strong in this effort, which still has certain aesthetic highlights worth appreciating, whether when we're talking about an atmospheric score by Barry Devorzon, or talking about Gerry Fisher's sometimes hauntingly sparse cinematography, whose tastefulness helps draw you in, but not as much as the person in charge of orchestrating style, as well as substance. William Peter Blatty, as director, hits enough missteps for his promising project to ultimately come out as underwhelming, but his strengths as storyteller cannot be denied, as the film is not only stylish, but has a certain meditative atmosphere to it that rarely dries up so much that blandness really kicks in amidst pacing problems, and bites pretty firmly when material kicks in, drawing tension in form of anything from intrigue to genuine chills. Whether it be some particularly intense scenes of danger, or particularly strong scenes in which George C. Scott's Lt. William F. Kinderman character confronts a lunatic who claims to be the fictitious, dangerous and supposedly deceased Gemini Killer in isolation, there are highlights here and there throughout this film that Blatty nails, and while such moments aren't nearly consistent enough to craft a rewarding final product, the inspiration that Blatty pumps into this film, at least director, is endearing, and carries the film a good ways, especially with a strong cast at his back. The unevenly used Brad Dourif steals the show in his startlingly effective portrayal of a profoundly disturbed murderer, but most everyone is commendable, and that particularly goes for leading man George C. Scott, who, make no mistake, was given a Razzie nod simply because of the Razzie's morbid sense of humor about classic talents in not-so classic follow-ups to classics, for although acting material is limited for Scott, his thorough charisma and potent dramatic layers as a man of the law whose exploration of a darkly mysterious case will leave him to face evils beyond human belief is very strong, and carries much of the film's weight. The film is about as well-acted as any \"Exorcist\" film, including the very well-acted first installment that we all know and respect, and while a strong lead, backed by strong supporting players, isn't going to be enough to carry the final product as downright rewarding, there's enough done right on and off of the screen for the final product to compel just fine, regardless of shortcomings.\r\n\r\nBottom line, unevenness in tone and pacing behind a story that is too formulaic for its own good, and told with too much ambition for its own good, leave the final product to fall short of rewarding, but there's still enough potential to this story concept, tastefulness to musical and visual style, effectiveness within William Peter Blatty's atmospheric direction, and strength within the acting - particularly by show-stealer Brad Dourif and show-carrier George C. Scott - for \"The Exorcist III\" to stand as a flawed, but often effective and ultimately adequately worthy installment in Blatty's classic saga.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

My personal favorite is, \"On the entry exam for the new policeman, they ask \"What are rabies and what would you do for them?\" Ryan said, \"Rabies are Jewish priests and I would do anything I possibly could for them.\" \"He also has a pretty popular monologue about carp, but I won't spoil it. Anyway, a child from a group the police sponsors is beheaded. \n\nMeanwhile, Kinderman and Father Dyer go see \"It's a Wonderful Life\" as a way of forgetting their friend Damien Karras's death. They hang out at a restaurant where Kinderman fills Dyer in on the details of the slain boy. His head was replaced with a statue, stuff was jammed through his eyes, all that fun jazz.\n\nLater, a woman goes to confess to a priest and the priest ends up dead. Turns out, the same M.O. was used by the killer as was used on the boy. Soon after, Dyer ends up in a hospital, where all of his blood is drawn, without a single drop spilled, into jars. And with the remaining blood, the words \"It's a Wonderfull Life\" are written on the wall. \n\nWell, it turns out that these killings are very similar, in fact, identical, to those of a previous serial killer named \"The Gemini Killer\". The only problem is, he's been dead for about fifteen years. So how is this happening?\n\nI know what you're thinking at this point in the review. What the holy hell does this have to do with \"The Exorcist\"? Well, patience. It has a tie in. It turns out the spirit of the dead Gemini Killer found its way into Karras's body just before he died, and he's now locked in the basement of the hospital. How's he getting around? Why Father Karras's body? \n\nWell, that's up to you to find out. And trust me, it's worth it.\n\nOne of the best things this movie has going for it is Brad Dourif, who plays the Gemini Killer. He even utters a line of shameless self-promotion. \"Child's play, Lieutenant.\" The back and forth between Scott and Dourif is completely insane, and chalk full of over the top emotion. Tack on a creepy performance of Jason Miller, reprising his role as Father Karras as well as another character, and you've got a terrifically acted sequel.\n\nIs it scary? It has its moments. Particularly the scene in the hospital hallway, which has some of the best buildup and one of the best payoffs in horror history. In my personal opinion, and remember, this is purely opinion, this movie is better than the original.\n\nI know. Sacrilege, right? Well, we all have our tastes, and mine don't have to be yours. Give this movie a try. Maybe you won't feel the same way I do, but I know you'll enjoy it if you like horror.",

Despite being locked away in the bowels of the local hospital, the Gemini continues to kill, and it is up to Detective Kinderman to stop his supernatural murder spree! EXORCIST 3 comes as an unexpected surprise after the first disappointing sequel, combining the gripping suspense of a tightly-wrought thriller with the otherworldly terror of the original. William Peter Blatty directs this time around from his own screenplay and novel, and while his style lacks refinement, it is never-the-less effective in setting a frightening mood and delivering a strong, character-driven story. The main faults lie in his artificial language and jarring edits, but these are mostly overcome by the enjoyable performances that come as a result. George C. Scott takes a commanding lead as the boisterous Detective Kinderman, and Jason Miller excels in the role of the villain as the Gemini's earthly vessel. The real treat, however, comes from genre vet Brad Dourif in an electrifying performance as the Gemini, himself. Dourif explores a range of terrifying emotions, from calculated cruelty to raging hatred. He is at his best here. Although the majority of the film plays out like a murder mystery, EXORCIST 3 packs a fiery finale that delivers on the series' name. It has also gained a cult following for creating one of the scariest moments in all of Horror, but for that, you will just have to wait and see!\n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies",

            "content": "*** out of ****\r\n\r\nLet's get something straight. This is not really \"The Exorcist III\". It may don the name, but only because the studio intended for it to be a commercial effort. It is a continuation of the events that closed William Friedkin's screen adaptation of \"The Exorcist\", which was based on a novel written by William Peter Blatty - who wrote and directed this film. It picks up after Father Karras (Jason Miller) jumped out the window of the MacNeil house in Georgetown, Washington and rolled down that famous flight of stairs to his death, with the demon Pazuzu still possessing his body and soul. But \"The Exorcist III\" does not involve Pazuzu at all. In fact, its demons consist of mortals and immortals; things both real and paranormal. It's an ambitious mixture, yes, but surprisingly enough it actually ends up working and makes the material more than just another cheap \"sequel\", which - more or less - it kind of is and kind of isn't.\r\n\r\nThe story follows a series of bizarre murders - mostly decapitations - that occur fifteen years after \"The Exorcist\". The MacNeils don't live here (in this universe) anymore. The first murder is of a teenage black kid, and the crime scene is being investigated primarily by Lieutenant William Kinderman (George C. Scott); who always gets depressed on the anniversary of Karras's death. This explains why he and his priest friend Father Dyer (Ed Flanders) attend a screening of their favorite movie - the cheerful \"It's a Wonderful Life\" - on that day. Soon afterwards Father Dyer is mysteriously hospitalized and then murdered in cold blood. There was another murder before this; that of, yes, another priest - this time one who gets a direct visit from a supposedly sinful old woman who mutters strange and disturbing things under her breath hoping that the priest will hear her out.\r\n\r\nThe fingerprints left at each of the murders are that of a different person; so there is more than one killer. Kinderman somehow relates the murders to those committed by a man known as the Gemini Killer some time ago; although the man had since been sent to the electric chair. Nevertheless, the head of a local psychiatric ward sees some resemblance between this Gemini fellow and a guy in Cell 11 that has been locked up, merely existing in this secluded little room, for fifteen straight years. When Kinderman visits the patient, he first resembles Karras; but he then reveals himself to be something far more sinister and diabolical. He claims that he is the Gemini Killer (Brad Dourif), and he is quite possibly just a demon capable of possessing multiple bodies to commit the murders, if he is in fact the perpetrator.\r\n\r\nBlatty's last job behind the camera was as the writer and director of \"The Ninth Configuration\", an adaptation of a novel he wrote, but that was about ten years prior to \"The Exorcist III\". He hasn't gone on to direct anything else since, although I can't see why. He doesn't seem to resent the experience of making the film, and he's apparently happy with the final product even if the studio restrained him just a bit and forced him to include an exorcism scene last minute. What more could you ask for? Blatty demonstrates every basic quality of a talented genre filmmaker; and some of the best scenes here rival the atmosphere of the first \"Exorcist\", which is my favorite horror film, although clearly not Blatty's. My biggest gripe is that it's got a great hour and thirty five minutes, and then the last fifteen are fairly silly in comparison. This is the final fifteen where Blatty brings out the big guns; although the guns don't come with dramatic gunpowder but rather lots and lots of special effects, all of which have dated by now. But Friedkin's first film is no different; yet still better. But why compare?\r\n\r\nIt's a strange film full of strange - but bewildering and beautiful - images and memorable situations. And it's an absolute blast to watch. It's a shame that the footage from Blatty's alleged \"Director's Cut\" is now lost forever (well, as far as we know); but the version that remains is good enough as it is. By mixing a crime drama with a horror film (filled with genuine scares and chills, no less); Blatty's made a film that is both messy and fascinating. Not to mention intelligent and thoroughly thought-provoking. Dourif's performance is probably one of the most criminally underrated in horror history and his scenes are unmistakably some of the most compelling. This is the kind of movie where the unhinged zaniness of Dourif feels right at home; this is an explosively imaginative picture that possesses the senses for a good hour and fifty minutes, which is about as much as one can take at once in the case of \"The Exorcist III\". It doesn't overstay its welcome and I can definitely dig that.",

An angel disassembled and evolving back into itself. HOW NICE... instead of fighting the devil, humans ARE the devil. Boo.",

Blatty is given the opportunity to direct and does a great job of setting a dark atmospheric creepy feel and while it is a great movie the last 10 minutes or so really let it down,of course the required exorcism that the studio demanded appears nowhere in the book and the resulting effect was almost comical.

The scenes of Scott's Hinderman and Dourif's killer in his asylum cell are bleak and depressing but not really scary.  These scenes are also very long and could have been trimmed down and not lost their effectiveness.  There is one shocking scene when a nurse is attacked that really catches you by surprise and it leaves you wishing there was more of this kind of jump scares in the movie.  I'm not a big fan of the jump scare, but this movie could have used more of them.  \r\nOverall, it seems more of a heavy crime drama.

Here, William Peter Blatty, original author of the novel, steps up to write and direct, ignoring Exorcist II: The Heretic and adapting his own follow-up book, Legion.\n\nToo much of the movie takes place in dark rooms where people describe horrors that might more profitably have been on the screen, and the plot is a house of cards that constantly collapses as Blatty the screenwriter poses Blatty the director challenges that he can't meet.\n\nHowever, the film comes to life in a few brief, illogical flashes that deliver genuine scares - a possessed old woman crawling ignored on the ceiling, a white-robed figure with an impressive decapitation implement drifting after a doomed nurse. Examining Blatty's original cut, the producers decided an Exorcist sequel ought to have an exorcism in it, and so Nicol Williamson was called in for extra Bible-thumping scenes which look exactly like tacked-on additions that pad out an already-ludicrous climax ('I believe in slime,' Scott yells) to insane proportions.\n\nThough dressed up with a lot of talk about faith and the nature of Evil, The Exorcist III is essentially yet another variation on the cycle of movies (The Hidden, Shocker, The First Power) in which a cop pursues a body-hopping serial murderer, with mad-eyed Dourif doing the act he had already perfected in Child's Play.\n\nThe major fault in The Exorcist III is the house-of-cards plot is constantly collapsing.",

Only he was executed years ago. We see Brad Dourif as the Gemini Killer and Jason Miller as Father Damien Karras (thats right, hes back). \n\nThe acting was fantastic, besides having Dourif (who plays Chucky in Childs Play) they also had George C. Scott who plays Lt. Bill Kinderman. Both did a great job of selling the character. \n\nThe scenery was great at creating the mood, the hosptial rooms where very creepy and gothic. The script was fantastic for a third film in what seemed to be a dying franchise. It was filled with good diologue and great lines.",

            "content": "I had the misfortune of watching The Exorcist 2 a couple months back.The film was boring, lazy and in no way a worthy successor to the original film, so the writer decided \"enough\" and took the reins for The Exorcist 3, both writing the screenplay and directing the film - and he did a far better job.\r\n\r\nThe problem faced by this film is twofold, firstly regardless of how good it is people will still say that \"sure it's better than 2, but that's not hard\", the other problem is that there was no way that it would top \"The Exorcist\", still a classic 30+ years after release.\r\n\r\nAnd of course here we are, a film far superior to the god-awful second, but not quite in the same league as the first, though precious few films are.\r\n\r\nWilliam Peter Blatty the writer of the original and this, and the director of 3 keeps a consistently creepy tone, there isn't much violence shown onscreen or even after the event, though there are some pretty graphic descriptions. The only variations are the first couple of minutes and the ultimate showdown finale, which veer dangerously into cheesy territory.\r\n\r\nTake the intro as a prime example, after some ominous nothings a church door flies open and leaves and debris fly in, which apparently awakens a statue of Jesus on the cross, who then cries?\r\n\r\nSeriously, this really happened. \"Naughty leaves, you woke Jesus!\"\r\n\r\nI can't help but feel that somehow a studio got involved and told the director \"look we like what you've done, but you have to open the film with a bang and close it with a big wild showdown. Neither change helped the film but it doesn't really detract too much.\r\n\r\nThe film is filled with realistic, normal everyday looking characters who talk in a fairly realistic way, given what occurs around them of course.\r\n\r\nThe basic plot is different to both the original and 2, no Reagan here, although she is very briefly referenced early on. A cop named Bill Kinderman, who was good friends with the priest from the first film, is now good buddies with another priest, Father Dyer who is a little morose about the state of the world. They obviously have known each other for some time and discuss their situations freely.\r\nHe tells the priest of a recent killing, a young teenage boy is decapitated and the body butchered in ritualistic fashion, shortly after another priest is murdered while hearing confession also in graphic fashion.\r\n\r\nGiven his occupation and what he sees everyday Bill has a pretty wacko dream, and I mean wacko. Want proof? Not only does the dream sequence have some pretty out there stuff going on, it also has Fabio and Samuel L Jackson as bystanders and a young Patrick Ewing as the Angel of Death.\r\n\r\nBill wakes up to find out that Father Dyer is dead in hospital, and not just dead, drained of blood dead.\r\n\r\nBill immediately orders the hospital shut down, much to the chagrin of the hospital management. He then explains the nature of a case from 15 years prior, the case of the Gemini Killer.\r\n\r\nThe Gemini Killer was a serial killer who performed depraved, unworldly executions of innocent and somewhat random victims, Bill goes on to describe specific details that were not released to the public, but which are now being performed on the new victims, the boy and priests.\r\nBill believes that somehow the Gemini Killer is back.\r\n\r\nLo and behold a patient in the same hospital claims to be the killer, and in a one on one chat he tells Bill in no uncertain terms that this is the case, and describes several things that only the killer would know. Not only this, but to Bill from time to time the patient appears to change from the actor Brad Dourif to Father Karras from the original film, this would obviously be a bit unnerving, on top of this his voice alters periodically into a demonic rasp.\r\n\r\nTo describe what happens after would start giving the game away, nonetheless Bill and the Gemini Killer are destined to come face to face, Brad Dourif gives a powerful performance which could have easily been cartoonish and hammy in lesser hands.\r\n\r\nThere are two really memorable scenes in the second half of the film, one has echoes of events in the first but is pretty jaw dropping and unexpected when it happens, the second is pretty well known and occurs over a patient two minute single shot when a nurse in the hospital is doing her rounds.\r\n\r\nI remember a few years back there were two Exorcist prequels being released at the same time, so they altered the names a little.\r\n\r\nI bet Blatty wishes that he could retitle The Exorcist 2 to anything but, as The Exorcist 3 is the only worthy sequel to the masterful original, and a strong movie in its own right.\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 7.5 / 10. Don't write everything in this series off after the second horrible rubbish. This is good stuff.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",

Sure, there's a fair amount of humor early on, but when the film really gets going, its no laughing matter. I only have two problems with the movie. George C.

            "content": "I had heard some good things about this prior to seeing it, so it came as quite a shock to behold the sheer ineptitude of this pointless production.\n\nScreenwriter/Director William Peter Blatty shoehorns portions of his \"Exorcist\" mythology into what otherwise was a straight adaptation of his (Exorcist-free) serial killer novel \"Legion.\" At best a journeyman filmmaker, the results come off like an episode of TVs \"Criminal Minds;\" featuring Special Guest Star Jason Miller as \"Patient X/Father Karras.\" It stars George C. Scott as the police detective played by Lee J. Cobb in the original; apparently the worthy inspector has developed a bipolar problem in the intervening years, as he tends to unexpectedly SCREAM various lines apropos of not very much. The late Mr. Scott always was able to chew scenery with the best of them, here he's like a starved wolverine. Ed Flanders (TVs \"St. Elsewhere\") is Scott's friend from the original case (huh?) and sports one of the most distracting perms in cinema history. Which is okay, because he's basically there to be a Sacrificial Lamb. Uh... SPOILER, I guess. We also get Tracy Thorne as The Obvious Red Herring\u00c2\u00ae, and Nicol Williamson as The British Actor with Gravitas Brought in after Rewrites to Play an Exorcist. Because the title of the movie has the word \"Exorcist\" in it.\n\nThe always-useful Brad Dourif actually comes out of this picture smelling pretty good -- his portrayal of the serial killer \"Gemini\" has genuine power, and even a degree of pathos. Spending all his film time in shackles and straitjacket, he communicates purely with his voice and his eyes, and unyieldingly commands our fear and awe. Actors could do worse than to study his performance here for tips on how to play anguish, rage, and evil.\n\nSpeaking of rare bright spots, Blatty does pull off one exceptionally well-done suspense scene. We, through the unmoving camera's unblinking eye, are looking down a mostly-deserted hospital corridor in the evening's late hours. Way down the hall, there is a lone nurse working her station... and she keeps hearing (as do we) sounds. Quiet, hard-to-identify... sounds. This sequence, which goes on for some agonizing minutes, doesn't have anything really splashy; the nurse gets up, walks around, checks a door here and there, gets a drink of water -- the usual late-night routine of a nurse's rounds. Meanwhile, there are... sounds. And the camera never moves, never blinks. I'm not going to give anything away, suffice it to say that experienced horror film viewers will (rightly) expect a Val Lewton bus. All the better to give us a moment's respite from the tension, heh-heh-heh. This sequence is so outstanding that I almost wonder if Mr. Blatty actually created it, so pedestrian is his direction of the rest of the film. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt, I guess.\n\nYou get a little bit of gore, a little bit of biblical-sounding pronouncements, a bit of the ol' \"the power of Christ compels you!,\" and a taste of Mike Oldfield's \"Tubular Bells.\" Sad that that excellent piece of music has been reduced to not much more than a brand identifier for this franchise, which started off so brilliantly. Oldfield, like us all, deserve better.",

The cast does a fairly decent job, and the film is filled with tense moments of creepy atmosphere and suspenseful scenes. A solidly paced and directed horror film, Exorcist III is a different take on the story, but it does succeed on creating effective terror and jolts. Although not as memorable as the original masterpiece, Exorcist III is still a  necessary film to watch. What's great about the film is that it still manages at delivering good scares, but unlike the original, it doesn't have the intensity that you'd want from a film like The original, but compared to the second one, this third entry is an improvement. There's plenty of good elements to deliver an effective horror film here, but in the end I felt it also was a good stand alone film as well, not a film that necessarily needed The Exorcist title on the cover. The film is very entertaining for what it is, and though is not as horrifying as the original film, it still has enough good horror bits to really make it an interesting, and scary horror film to watch. If you loved the original, was disappointed by the second; then check this one out, the film is worth your time, and will give you a few good jolts in the process.",

Nothing seems particularly important until it isn't, because Dourif is crazy, the demon is still on the loose, and yes, you'll get the visceral thrills of the occult violence that you paid to see...eventually. \"The Exorcist III\" is obsessed with dropping breadcrumbs everywhere and fails to bring us into the moment convincingly.

            "content": "The Exorcist films present an interesting paradox as the first two installments represent both the zenith and nadir of cinematic horror, respectively. The William Friedkin original was as instrumental in furthering the genre as Murnau's Nosferatu or Hitchcock's Psycho, while the second was an overproduced late-70's romp where the only real scare was the raw disco chic terror floating off the screen on Richard Burton's acidic booze breath. Some franchises just don't wait to jump right off a cliff. It would be thirteen years before anyone felt clean enough to touch the series again, and it is appropriate that William Peter Blatty, the writer of the novels and the screenplay for the original film, would be given the reins to guide the story back into the light. And so in 1990 he gave us The Exorcist III - a curious title given that the film completely ignores the events of John Boorman's pitiful second outing. In hindsight, a more apt title would probably have been \"How to Bounce Back Without Anyone Really Noticing\".\r\n\r\nNow, allow me to spew some apostasy your way. Though its plot construction -- with particular regards to its third act -- is less so, The Exorcist III is an eerier, stranger, and in many ways more frightening movie than Friedkin's masterpiece. Blatty takes a break from Friedkin's pseudo-documentarian, urban grit style and goes for something more dreamlike and quiet. This is a movie where the air itself seems corrupted by unseen horrors, and evil lurks through the halls of churches and madhouses alike. Yes, there is a certain bit of nonsense that comes from fiction like this, what with the whole idea of demons swirling about to chomp on our souls, however the idea that there is good and evil in the world is a fairly universal one and Blatty is just a terrific writer. The material probably doesn't deserve him, but here he is marshaling snappy dialogue, fine performances, and dripping atmosphere that gives the whole fantasy more teeth than it should have.\r\n\r\nGeorge C. Scott picks up fifteen years after Lee J. Cobb left off in the original as Lt. Kinderman, a Georgetown homicide detective whose gruesome work over the years has left him tired and faithless, despite the insistence of his friend Father Dyer (Ed Flanders) that God is in his heaven and in control even as serial killers decapitate young boys and priests. A strange set of murders has rattled Kinderman to his core, not so much because of their gruesome nature, but rather because they follow the exact pattern of a killer that was supposedly put to death also fifteen years prior. The modus operandi is that of the Gemini Killer James Venumin (a magnificent Brad Dourif) who paralyzed his victims with neurotoxins and then brutally tortured and murdered them before desecrating their remains. The pattern is convincing to Kinderman because it follows the Gemini's behavior that was not disclosed to the press, and when Father Dyer himself ends up on the wrong end of the killer's intent, Kinderman must peer through the fog of his own fear, anger, and disbelief to see the supernatural evil that often lurks right in front of his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe strangest development, however, is the man in isolation in the psych ward at the hospital where two of the murders have occurred. You may or may not remember the ending of the original Exorcist, and I won't give it away here, but it is shall we say less than likely that Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), who drove out the demon fifteen years prior, would be holed up in a sanitarium. Which makes for a shock when Kinderman incredulously deduces that the man in isolation is indeed Damien Karras. What's even stranger, however, is that Karras is claiming to be the Gemini Killer.\r\n\r\nWhether Karras is mad, or is even Karras, or whether the Gemini Killer is still alive are all possibilities I will defer to the film for disclosure, but, unlike the first film, it isn't the plot developments that drive this movie home. There are no spinning heads here. Instead, Blatty focuses his efforts on tone, and his movie drips with more atmosphere than the last ten horror movies I've seen because of it. If you stuck your hand in this movie it would come out cold and terrified. I know a lot of people were horrified by The Exorcist, but it was always the cruel hospital scenes that gave me the chills more than any amount of flying split pea soup. The Exorcist III brings the ethereal into the hospital, where the nightmares of needles and demonic possession can walk hand in hand, and the lines between the empirical and the spiritual begin to blur. The result is, yes, scarier than anything in Friedkin's movie, if less shocking and with muddy impact because of the botched and producer-infected final reel. This is a movie that doesn't deserve its final scenes. Its last moments that seem inflicted rather than played out, and studio tinkering looms over the finale like, well, demonic possession. What's encouraging, though, is that Blatty is good enough of a writer and director to let his story weather this intrusion. Silly though it is when juxtaposed against the rest of the picture, the special-effects-laden ending still works even if largely due to the strength of scenes that came before it.\r\n\r\nI've mentioned that the writing is good in the movie, but I should spend a word on the performances. Scott's Kinderman is a more solemn affair than Cobb's almost mischievous gumshoe. I say this with love, but Scott always was something of a ham and Blatty doesn't really force him to break that streak, though in the end he does just fine coming across as a man on the verge of utter defeat. The real delivery work in the movie, however, comes from Brad Dourif who's Gemini Killer is given the movie's best scenes and its best dialogue and he still manages to make it look like a day's work. I have always felt that Dourif is an underrated talent and if I cite One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as exhibit A, then Exorcist III is a resounding follow up. The Chucky movies fall somewhere high on some other scale, I'm sure.\r\n\r\nThe constant between Exorcist III and its progenitor is Blatty's insistence that faith in higher things is necessary to combat actual evil. Like Father Karras in the first film, Kinderman is helpless against the rising tide of horror around him because of -- and specifically because of -- his disbelief in goodness in the world. Though that sounds myopic on the surface, I don't think it takes a Bible-believing Christian to get something from the notion of hope in the better angels of our nature. Indeed, Blatty is a fiercely devout Catholic, but like any good Catholic he's not concerned with turning you into one. These films are stories about good and evil and about how each side must believe in what it is doing in order to overcome the other. One of the film's best moments comes when a clearly possessed man chastises Kinderman for his failure to believe. The demon, you see, is always devout.\r\n\r\nSCORE: 8 / 10",

This is no tired retread of an existing formula within the franchise but an intelligently written and quietly disturbing piece of cinema.  There was barely anyone in the flicks when I saw this back in 1990 and one can only assume that the critics' opinions had worked their worst or that people still had bad memories of John Boorman's first sequel The Heretic.  George C. Scott is terrific - his desperate containment of his grief following a dear friend's murder is deeply affecting and for my money this contains one of THE best jump-out-of-your-seat moments in cinema history.  Not one for those who think dialogue is boring which is a shame as it's ripe and a delight to listen to.

This isn't to say that the film doesn't have its problems. On the contrary, its biggest problem, the out-of-character 'crowd-pleasing' SFX climax stops it from being one of the greats. So why do I have a soft spot for this film? If, like me, you appreciate horror films that are both scary and made for grown-ups, 'Exorcist III' is refreshing and memorable for its intelligent, non-ironic journey into darkness and for its refusal (bar that ending) to dumb down for the kids. If 'Scream' is your idea of a great horror movie, this isn't one for you! The cast is not nearly young and attractive enough, there are nowhere near enough gags (though Blatty's dry, sardonic wit is happily in evidence) and the film has no pretensions at being an autopsy of the genre, therefore somehow lifting it above the films it purports to comment on. 'Exorcist III' is literary beyond 'Scream's' self-referential trivia-chasing (I would love to hear Detective Kinderman critiquing that movie!) Read 'Legion' and you'll have an idea of how good the film should have been. Flaws acknowledged and accepted, don't miss out on Brad Dourif's best performance since 'Cuckoo's Nest,' scene-stealing turns by Ed Flanders and Nancy Fish, or the superlative production design, photography and sound. More than anything else, it's the atmosphere of the film that stays with me. I can recall very few films that have a better sense of the power of stillness and silence.
