It is funny, heartwarming, and filled with fantastic original Christmas songs. It is nothing overly special but does what it needs to.\n\nThe writing for this special was pretty lackluster, there were more than a handful of lines that felt very awkward. I would question the acting, but we've seen and fell in love with these characters on the screen before, so the writing seems to be the culprit. Many of the Kevin Bacon and Kraglin's lines were cheesy and inorganic. I am not sure if that was the intent, but it just did not work for me.\n\nThe comedy is fantastic and hand me audibly laughing at many scenes. It was great to see the gang back together again and has me that much more excited for Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3.\n\nOverall, this was a decent entry into the MCU. Short, fun, and lighthearted. It does not attempt to be more than that.\n\nScore: 54%\nVerdict: Average",

After having seen the Disney+ special Werewolf by Night I got to say that my hopes were high concerning this show.\n\nSet during the Christmas season sometime after the events of Thor: Love and Thunder, the Guardians of the Galaxy are taking some much-needed time off from adventures after the Snap. Quill is going through the motions having come back, and has missed out and missed a lot of things gone. So, his two Guardians friends Drax and Mantis are out on their way to fulfill the Christmas spirit by dolling up Knowhere, their base of operations, and turning it into a Christmas surprise that is as chaotic as their typical adventures.\n\nI got to say that James Gunn made this particularly silly and not the most watchable as the movies with its absurd humor and no grand action, but it has its moments. Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff are the true leads to this story with the other Guardians supporting leads, but it works as Pom has spent less time with the group than the others. I appreciate how much Chris Pratt has matured his depiction of Quill and it's plenty fine seeing the rest of the Guardians. But this made me prefer to watch the movies more than this special. Not as great but still alright.",
