It has none of the spark of the original, all of the good characters and comic relief is gone, the new actress who plays Mulan is very bland, and Mulan doesn't learn and train how to be a soldier, she is just born special which makes her cocky throughout the movie. Just watch he original, it has better action, characters, and story. While I'm writing this I really think it's one of the most worthless pieces of content out there.",

This makes her a much less compelling character overall. I don't know how anyone can enjoy this without nostalgia goggles.",

Jet Li acted very awkwardly with his lines, there were no songs which made the original fantastic, there was no Mushu, there were awkward moments with awkward characters that shouldn't have been added to the story (like the bird lady), and many scenes were forgettable by the end of the film. This is one of the worst production decisions that Disney has made, and the best Disney movie imo did not have to be remade like this. DON'T TOUCH THE CLASSICS THAT WE ALL LOVE AND ADORE!!",

Debo decir que lo que me gusto de esta película fueron los detalles técnicos, la producción, las escenas de acción, la banda sonora, todo eso es muy bien. Pero la trama y el guion tienen un aura diferente. No está mal que la hayan hecho seria porque así es como me gusta, pero la trama necesitaba una mejor construcción y más profundidad. Creo que a esta película le hubiera ido mejor si hubiera sido dirigida por un cineasta chino, ya que mucho no se siente como una película china y además la protagonista Mulan requería más profundidad y se podría haber compensado si ella hubiera tenido más conflictos. La verdad no sé qué pensar de ella, excepto que se siente muy básica al igual que los demás personajes que la acompañan. La película es entretenida y con eso es suficiente para mí, pero igual creo que esta película requería de un mejor desarrollo y hubiese sido conveniente que hubiera quedado en manos de un auténtico cineasta asiático. Yo a esta película le doy un 6/10, ya que no está a la altura de la versión animada, pero tampoco puedo apedrearla tanto por eso, así que le doy esa nota por simple generosidad.",

The point of Disney and the point of making these films in the live action is to give us exactly what we want and that's a re-creation of the cartoon with a little bit of a twist to give a difference. So it doesn't look and act exactly the same. But they went way too far and they even turned Shayne into a sissy, and yes, the character was attractive enough to play the role, but they did not utilize him the way he should have. And then the biggest downfall of all they remove the music. I was done after that.",

That a powerless girl with no prior training would brave it all to join the army in her father's place showed the audience how much she loved her father and family and touched us with her filial piety and bravery.\n\nThe new Mulan is mythically empowered to be better, stronger and faster than men in every way. She overcame no struggles and easily overpowers her male comrades and all the enemy at every turn with ease. The audience is supposed to believe that she has supernatural powers because... reasons. There is no emotional connection to her supposed sacrifice for her father whatsoever because she has superpowers anyway and she's basically going there to massacre the enemy for fun. \n\nThe woke agenda is supposed to make us respect women but instead they are teaching little girls how NOT to become women that men genuinely respect for who they are and what they do.",

            "content": "Saw 2020's 'Mulan' as a massive Disney fan. Although their recent live action offerings are very mixed and none are as good as the originals, many of their animated films are fine examples of how to do animation right. Looking at the title, the advertising and that seeing it was made by Disney, it is very easy to think that this is another one of the live action remakes and it is easy why it has been critiqued as one. Part of me was really psyched being somebody who loves the 1998 film, but also worried when seeing the hate for the film and for the lead actress.\n\nWhen seeing 'Mulan', it didn't actually strike me as a live action remake and doesn't have an awful lot of Disney in sight. Other than the title and references to the score of the 1998 film embedded in this one. Instead to me it came over as more another version of the character and her story, and one more serious and less family friendly, so directly comparing the two films didn't strike me as right. While the disappointment that is expressed is understandable, as there are big flaws to be found and it definitely does not have the same amount of charm, heart and thrills as the 1998 film, to me 'Mulan' was not that bad and was not deserving of the extreme backlash before it was even released. Seeing as Yifei Liu's personal views had/have nothing to do with Disney or the film crew.\n\n'Mulan' is not perfect. Do agree with those that say that a lot of the dialogue is pretty bad, with a tendency to sound stilted, especially in the cringe-worthy and very out of place attempts at sporadic humour with the troops, and go too heavy on emphasising the characters' values. Loyal, brave and true agreed did not need to be emphasised so much, the point was made quite quickly. There are things in the plot that sounded oddly intriguing on paper, but done too little with. Especially with the phoenix, which doesn't really add anything.\n\nBoth Xianniang and Bori Khan felt like underdeveloped characters. The former comes off better as she is suitably mysterious and alluring, but her motives are pretty confused later on (with it being not clear what side she was on), she is pretty much a come and go plot device and her final scene felt very rushed. Bori Khan has an intimidating look but is underused and his motivation is pretty much the only thing that is learnt about him. Didn't like how easily defeated he was and how clumsy the scene looked. In general the characters could have done with more depth, Mulan and Zhou are the ones that come closest, and the film could have done with more soul.\n\nHowever, 'Mulan' does look great, especially striking in the truly exquisite historical visuals and the at its best majestic scenery. There is a lot of colour and atmosphere in the photography, which was clearly inspired by the likes of Zhang Yimou, and the costumes do catch the eye. The CGI didn't seem too excessive and didn't look jarringly cheap either. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is stirring and also has a sumptuous emotional core, also enjoyed hearing references to the music from the 1998 film. Niki Caro on the most part directs with confidence.\n\nPersonally really was impressed by the beautifully choreographed and dynamically photographed action. When it needed to be tense it was, when it needed to be particularly athletic it was and when it needed to excite it did. Especially the big battle and the avalanche. It was easy to feel the strength, pain and perseverance needed to get through all that training, only the final showdown came over as ridiculous. The story was not perfect but it engaged enough, intrigued with the cultural aspects and inspired thanks to Mulan still being a strong character (though she doesn't grow as much or go on a character journey as much as the animated Mulan, if to briefly compare). Although the father-daughter reunion was more emotionally powerful previously, it is still quite moving in a subtle way here.\n\nMoreover, the acting wasn't bad at all to me. Liu is a confident lead, bringing authority and vulnerability to Mulan that was ideal for this ideal heroine. Donnie Yen and Jet Li are strong authority figures and Jason Scott Lee does inject some menace into his underdeveloped role. Tzi Ma's performance is very telling in its nuance, more than once not even saying a word. Li Gong looks wonderful in the film and is both deceptively alluring and mysterious, despite the character herself is not meaty Gong's acting is quite complex.\n\nIn conclusion, prepared myself to hate it but quite liked it while finding it very flawed. 6/10",

I think the actors are very emotional and enthusiastic. There are realistic and spectacular performance scenes and filming locations. But according to the cartoons that Disney has made, it is more fun and inserts love drama than in the movie. So, I think watching cartoons is better. But if according to history, it will be a movie version that is more realistic and closer than the cartoon version. And the end of this famous female general of China also didn't end very well according to Sui-Tang composed by ChuRenHua during the Qing dynasty. But I can admit that this movie overall is a good movie for anyone who likes movies about the history of China. This movie is worth watching too, in my opinion. But according to the plot that the director brought to make this movie, it is interesting and inserts ideas, beliefs, roles and duties. In addition, many livelihoods and traditions, such as the duties of women in the past that are still in effect to this day. The belief that women are obligated to marry in order to build a reputation for their ancestry. Restrictions on the rights and obligations of women to stay at home, cooking and raising children, no matter how much time has passed, this belief still exists. This film therefore serves as a spokesperson and shows on the other side that women do not have a duty to just stay at home, cooking and raising children. We can work and build our reputation just like men. So, I think that besides the history, acting skills, scenes, places. This movie is considered a very good movie. And there are also beliefs about mythical beasts that are inserted into it as a little knowledge that adds to the story and makes the story more exciting.",

The title character is flat, uninspiring and just plan boring.  I will give Disney a small amount of credit for trying to do something different with the movie and did not just do a shot for shot remake of the animated movie as they did with \"The Lion King\".  Still their efforts are just plain disastrous.  The dialogue is contrived to the Nth degree.  The actors just phone it in.  None of them put any effort into their roles.  They all just seem like they are reading their lines and collect their paychecks.  The whole thing with Mulan and several other characters have superhuman abilities which is beyond stupid.  The villains can literally run up and down walls.  What in the world was that?  The fight scenes were not well done at all.  Nothing in this movie worked.

The film has a wonderful message about being true to yourself, but it also has elements of family devotion being important in Chinese culture which is thoroughly enjoyable. In fact, majority of the representation of Chinese culture in the film is well-realized. This is definitely a movie that adults will enjoy more than children.

            "content": "Disney's Mulan from 1998 is arguably the best of its entire animated collection. It's a beautiful, lovingly animated story told with a powerful message, one only made better by an impeccable soundtrack ranking amongst the studio's greats. In 2020, it was only a matter of time before the film got adapted into live action. How has it translated? Well, I just burned $30 on premium VOD to be able to tell you you definitely shouldn't.\n\nDespite adding and subtracting several characters and plot elements, the Mulan remake largely tells the same story as its animated counterpart, itself based on a centuries-old legend, the Ballad of Mulan. With an invasion from bandits on the horizon, the Emperor of China issues a decree for every family to present a male warrior for his army. Fearing for her frail father's life and with no other man to represent her family, Hua Mulan disguises herself as a man to join the army in his stead.\n\nI hate to sound like a broken record, but Disney's shoddy trend of remakes leaves me no other choice: this live action Mulan is worse in every way to its sister animation. Like the studio's other adaptations, it mixes up some of the supporting framework in its characters and side stories, but it's all empty posturing.\n\nMulan only goes through the motions, clumsily skipping over the masterful beats that make the cartoon so wonderful. The film presents itself as a deathly serious war epic, but hurts for cutting out pivotal characters such as Captain Shang and Mulan's ancestors and its songs (whose lovely melodies occasionally echo through the instrumental score). While these cuts are done in a respectable effort to distance the film from the animation, the crucial moments and dense development given to its characters during the film's songs are all gone with nothing to compensate, one notable new character aside (more on her later). It's as if the music, supporting crew, and all the content concerning them are blindly axed from the 90-minute original, with the areas surrounding them being stretched out in tedium to spit out a two hour movie.\n\nmulan 4\n\nAs a result, you never get that personal, investing connection to Mulan. Her growth into a leader and warrior doesn't feel active and natural, but like a recreation that expects you to fill in the missing development by having seen the gorgeously empowering animation first. It doesn't help that lead star Liu Yifie is too uncharismatic and blank-faced in an attempt to look stoic. And, her lack of acting aside, Yifie's shameful stance on the police and violence that's been erupting in Hong Kong in the current sours Mulan just that extra bit more.\n\nGong Li's performance as Xian Lang, a witch allied with the bandits from the north, is the only interesting character in the movie. Funnily enough, the new character's arc is almost entirely Mulan's from the animation, making her feel, while one of the better parts of the film, pretty much redundant.\n\nAs with the majority of Disney's other live action adaptations, Mulan does excel in one area: its visuals. Picking up on the accomplishments of last year's Aladdin, Mulan is wrapped in colorful costumes and production design that beautifully honor the 600 AD Tang Dynasty region it's set in. Mulan's home village is particularly eye-catching, and as the film progresses through snowy mountains, grassy fields bathed in golden sunsets, and striking Chinese architecture, it's almost always a visual treat. The heightened wire-work action incorporated into the film's set pieces, though sparse enough to make you pine for more, is also thoroughly stunning and one of Mulan's true accomplishments. In the uninspired story it's all set in, it's just too little, too late.\n\nMulan is one of the worst live action adaptations coming from Disney's ten-year cash-grabbing streak. It fails its protagonist, her journey, and everything else making the animation great in a choppy, half-hearted attempt to make something new.",

She has chi power that let her do everything, so she doesn't need to train any get better, she just needs to believe. Because this is THE ADULT VERSION. Also which. Because adult version. But honestly, the worst thing here is the editing and camera. It will never stop from keep zipping, doing slowmoes, and change potions every 2 seconds. It's awful. Bottom line, this movie sucks.

            "content": "A very disappointing remake to one of my favorite stories. In short:\n1) The movie is culturally inaccurate to the point of it being insulting\n2) The message of Mulan is supposed to be of strength and empowerment, instead in the movie Mulan is grossly subservient and was born with special powers.\n3) Strange decisions to add in certain scenes and characters that bring no value to the story.\n\n1) The movie is culturally inaccurate to the point of it being insulting\nWhen Niki Caro was announced as director, I flinched. I get the argument that race shouldn't matter when picking a competent movie director. And in many scenarios, I can agree with this. The reason why this argument doesn't work in this case is because the movie heavily relies on Chinese culture. And unless Niki Caro truly understands China's history, its philosophy, and way of life, then the depiction isn't going to be accurate, thus lowering the overall quality of the movie. \n\nThe Mulan live-action is a gross caricature of Chinese culture. Chinese people aren't obsessed with phoenixes. Filial piety and honor are important, but it's not our lifeblood and does not need to be shoved down our throats. The movie represents the Chinese as submissive, honor-obsessed dolls who think of nothing but to serve their country because they're supposed to. All of these random Chinese stereotypes and assumptions clumsily added to the movie just cheapen the overall message and makes it nearly impossible for me to take seriously.\n\n2) The message of Mulan is supposed to be of strength and empowerment, instead in the movie Mulan is grossly subservient and was born with special powers.\n\nIn other adaptations of Mulan, Mulan is supposed to be smart. Competent enough to keep up with the men, but not physically better. She stands out by being smart and embracing both her femininity and masculinity to outwit her struggles. Mulan in the live-action is just born strong. She shows no signs of cleverness throughout the movie. She beats all of her opponents through brute force and her special, birth-given chi powers. You can argue the catapult scene, but that act was so out of character for her it didn't make her come across as smart, it was just confusing for the audience.\n\nMulan is also supposed to feel like a real person. Someone who has struggles, dreams, ambitions. The Mulan in the live-action shows none of that. Her biggest struggle is hiding her chi powers because she's a woman. Eyeroll. In the Disney adaption, you can see the hesitation and fear in her eyes when she first gets to the training camp. You can see how she struggles to keep up. Mulan in the live-action gets to the camp and doesn't seem phased at all around all the other men and even very confidently pulls her sword on one of them within 30 seconds of arriving. Her hiding her special chi powers that normal people don't have as her biggest struggle cheapens the grit and resilience of the original Mulan.\n\n3) Strange decisions to add in certain scenes and characters that bring no value to the story.\n\nI still have no idea why the witch and phoenix were added to the movie. I thought the phoenix was a kite at first and it wasn't until it kept hovering around that I realized it was supposed to be integral to the movie. Except all it did was fly around as some sad attempt of a symbol. \n\nWhen the movie was first announced, I was really excited to hear that it was going to be a more realistic, mature take on the classic Disney film. I thought it would pay some homage to the animated version, but the live-action very randomly shows the iconic Disney scenes even though it has no place. To put simply, the live action attempts to send a different message than the original Disney, but then incorporates all the iconic animated scenes that have no relevance to the live action. The matchmaker scene, the firework/catapult scene, the scene of the lost battle. All vital to developing Mulan as a smart yet clumsy character in the animated movie when in the live action they portray Mulan as stoic and physically powerful. They chose to include the aforementioned scenes, but chose to omit scenes of the father trying to chase after Mulan in the rain after she leaves, Mulan cutting her hair, the father comforting her after her failed match-making. All of which would have fit into the movie perfectly. \n\nThere are so many more things wrong with the movie like the character development just being bland and the characters themselves just being one-dimensional (the dad, the sister (why was she even in the movie?), the love interest (I don't even know his name)) and the story-telling had no emotional depth to it. Some of the lines were so cringe and felt like some non-Chinese person writing what they think Chinese people say ('The fiercest winter storm could not take off this makeup', is this supposed to be some pathetic attempt at poetry?). Mulan's weird, submissive nature. She even says she 'Knows her place'. \n\nThis movie does such a huge disservice to a beautiful role model. I feel even angrier when I think about how it caricatures Chinese culture and makes one of China's most beloved heroines a laughingstock.",

The fun, the jokes, the songs, they're not here. And that's why I think it works (at least they tried) in a whole different way. \n\nAlthough this live-action version gives us some great sceneries and custom design, it lacks (at least for the first half) the essence and excitement, going for a linear and bland storyline. Everything just feels so rushed. The battle sequences were fun, but nothing outstanding, and this new villainess, I liked her. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of Disney's live actions, I stay with the animated originals all the way, but this was a mildly good attempt of telling a beloved story in a more \"realistic\" and different kind of way (that I'm pretty sure it will piss a lot of fans of the original).",

Not only that.  But the scenery, cosmetics, acting  and costume designs were outstanding.  Based on many reviews and word of mouth I almost didn't give this movie a chance. But I'm glad I did.

            "content": "As always, context is important and when it comes to Disney's 2020 re-imagining of the story of Mulan it should be noted that I was twelve years-old when the original animated film was released. That film, coming in between the likes of Hercules and Tarzan would signal the end of Disney's animation renaissance of the nineties and in many ways-though there are live-action re-imaginings of The Little Mermaid and Hercules among others in the works-this new Mulan somewhat feels as if it also signals the end of this particular brand exercise. What's most disappointing though, is this very easily could have felt like a turning point instead of a conclusion, but alas director Niki Caro's (Whale Rider, McFarland, USA) re-imagining of the material fails to inspire its own identity despite diverting the most from the original blueprint. Having now seen live-action adaptations of most if not all of those Ashman and Menken collaborations along with the likes of the classic princess tales (surely Disney won't make its own Snow White, Peter Pan, or Pinocchio again after so many iterations already having been produc...*googles furiously*...oh no) it would seem this trend has more or less run its course with more critical failures than successes even if most have knocked it out of the park in terms of box office. How this pertains to Caro's vision of the fictional folk heroine from the Northern and Southern dynasties of Chinese history though has to do with how audiences have come to perceive the film. Once regarded as the opportunity among the other, more formulaic fairy tales to become an authentic historical epic with sweeping visuals, large battles, and a brave female lead the sequence of events that have led Mulan to landing on Disney+ for an added premiere price seems to have reduced the impact of said opportunity. It's impossible to say if first impressions might have been stronger had the initial experience with Caro's film been on the big screen rather than from the comfort of my own home, but given some of the blatantly bad CGI work in a handful of shots it could have certainly come across worse as well, I guess. This is all to say that 2020's live-action version of Mulan funnily enough ends up making many of the same mistakes as its predecessors despite trying the hardest not to. This Mulan removes many of the elements that infused so much life and energy into the original without bothering to substitute them with anything new or substantial even as that seems to be the intent and not to simply strip away your favorite childhood aspects (and saving money on a CGI dragon) for the hell of it. Good intentions are always honorable (at least, one would hope), but the danger in adjusting a narrative that already worked so well and leaning more heavily into a certain theme tends to undo the crucial balance that was struck-likely not easily-before. As someone who found not only the music, but the arc of the camaraderie between our heroine and her newfound peers along with the strong tonal balance that the animated film exhibited alarmingly good as a child I had hopes that as an adult Caro's version-while clearly leaning into the more historical, less-musical side of things-might find its own balance and sense of self-being as well, but the biggest issue with Caro's film is that it knows it needs to be a massive, epic adventure, but doesn't really have any idea what it wants to be.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

In fact, it's so far off that if someone had told me that this was a low budget, knock-off, live-action remake by a random studio, I would believe him/her.\n\nThe story of Mulan centers on her struggle to become a strong soldier in contradiction to the stereotype of women being too weak and frail for military work. Her difficulties and eventual success are inspirational components that communicate the message \"if you work hard and never give up, anything is possible\". Her identity as a regular, weak woman in the very beginning resonates with viewers and is the main reason why Mulan is so beloved in the animated film.\n\nBut, for whatever reason, Mulan in the remake is instead given this mysterious \"qi\" magic power that only a select few people get to possess. To add to it, Mulan's unnatural \"qi\" power was given to her from birth instead of through any sort of hard work or tribulation. This very simple narrative transforms Mulan from a regular, relatable woman into a distant superhero destined to succeed from the very day she was conceived. In the end, the message of \"hard work=success\" from the original animated feature, reduces into the brutally unrelatable message of \"if you are born lucky, you will easily beat everyone else\".\n\nIn conclusion, playing with the essence of a story is a recipe for failure and there is no better example than 2020's Mulan. No amount of beautiful artistry and colors can save a broken story. Disney has made a massive mistake and if this type of writing is to continue, I can confidently say that there is no hope left for the future of live-action Disney remakes.",

Disney supports the genocide of the Uyghur people in China in the credits of this movie. This isn't just bad. It's EVIL. If I'm being honestly, for this reason alone I didn't want to watch the movie, but I saw it anyway because my wife pulled it up on D+.\n\nAside from the looming shadow of GENOCIDE looming over the movie, it was completely devoid of any joy or character development. In the original movie, Mulan is great because she works harder than anybody else and uses her creative intelligence to solve big problems. In the live action, she wins because GIRL POWER! She was born with magical abilities that just make her awesome so she can just do everything the best without really having to try or learn anything or overcome any real challenges. It was terrible story telling that fell completely flat. There was never any tension or doubt that she was just going to be even more awesome and win because ... of course she'll win! GIRL POWER!\n\nDon't get me wrong. I have no problem with female characters. I have quite a few favorites that are female. Favorite Sci-Fi Character: Ripley from Alien. Favorite Distopian Character: Katness from the Hunger Games. Favorite Justice Leaguer: Wonder Woman. Favorite Democratic Politician: Tulsi Gabbard. Favorite Politician from Texas: Kathy Glass. I don't want to list them all here, but the majority of my favorite singers are female. Long story short, I LOVE women and I want to see them portrayed WELL in stories.

Utterly racist Hollywood choose to character assassinate a famous Chinese Heroine this way and at the same time make racist conjecture about Chinese culture.\n\nIf they bothered to do some research, there are many reasons why Chinese mothers are traditionally power figures in the family, NOT THE MEN.

Casting was a pleasant surprise; many A-list Asian actors signed up for the generous House of Mouse paycheck.\n\nOf course the photography and production were very high. But when contrasted against similar Chinese period war dramas, no real added value can really be noticed. Disney received value for its money, but a live-action budget of this scale is way over the top. Much of it likely due to filming in New Zealand instead of China alone, although likely there would have been more restrictions on a Chinese production.\n\nPerhaps one stereotypical criticism I have is that because the language is in English, the actors speak in accented English (it not being their native language for any of them). I don't know if Mandarin (or Cantonese) is offered on the DVD/Blu-ray, but it would be more authentic to hear the script in Chinese.\n\nOverall a good effort.",

The cast is good as well; Liu Yifei does a solid job but is not as compelling as I'd hoped. Culturally, this movie does a better job than the animated original to be both genuine and respectful, but at other times it slips back into a cringe-inducing US orientalist gaze.\n\nThe pacing also felt off in this film, with strangely dissonant cuts between certain scenes. At times, it felt like the movie was not cohesive. The fantasy, in fact the entire addition of the witch, was half-hearted and not well integrated into the story. The movie seemed to be trying to do too many things at once, and achieve too much at once. While Gong Li's witch character was important thematically, the movie did not devote enough attention to her and as a result her presence lacked the emotional satisfaction or investment to really be worthwhile. Similarly, Mulan and Honghui's connection felt a little unearned.\n\nOverall, the visuals are not enough (in my opinion) to make this a priority watch. Probably leave it near the bottom of your watch-list and prioritise other films first.",

All the fun was sucked out of it and the changes made hindered the movie.  The reliability of the core story goes out the window 5 minutes in.

I did not appreciate that this film altered the spirits with a witch, Mushu dragon for a Phoenix, or the over the top fantasy acrobatics and martial arts that did not hit as well. This film also did not hit the same emotional and dramatic emotional tensions that the 1998 film hit with the consequences to their actions. The 1998 film clearly showed the significance of family honor, dishonor, death, family, consequences for their actions. This live action film fewer main characters hit the emotional consequences. This film has the Emperor acting out more doing things I could not see from an Emperor such as get into armor. I did feel like the training scene did not provide enough to show how difficult training was compared to the Animated film. However this film does show more time in training giving the impression more time was spent on training vs the animated film from 1998. I also got the impression in this film that training was incomplete where as in the Animated film I felt like training was nearly complete. I was not a big fan of the villains in this film. I did not find them as scary as the animated film. One thing that was great about this film was that it expanded the world of China by showing a much larger area of China further west compared to the 1998 film by showing what was going on in areas in the Silk Road. I did find the big battle with the Huns rather disappointing in this film compared to the 1998 animated film. The 1998 film showed a much more interesting environment and tougher odds with a much larger army going up a small army in a snowy mountains where as in this film it felt rather small and less interesting taking place in a flat area surrounded by mountains. It just did not show as tough of a struggle compared to the animated film and show how significant the battle was.",

The cast itself (at least some of it) does a pretty good job in the story.  Liu Yifei does a pretty good job as the female warrior disguising as a man in the Chinese army and the rest of the cast is mostly . . . forgettable.  Mulan's father, Hua Zhou did a very good job in his role, and I guess that I accepted the rest of the cast.  As with most of the live action films coming from Disney the design is  very well done.  The most bugging part of the film is that its unrealistic to it's own story.  Disney forgets that they are working with humans instead of superhumans (too much Marvel maybe?) and decides that Mulan can kick arrows at everyone else, and that the Huns are great at running up and down walls.  The villain defeat has got to be at least one of the dumbest yet.  In the next remake remember who you're dealing with.  Humans or superhumans.",

Which I can understand it's humiliated for the matchmaker, but this one she tried to kill a dangerous spider and destroyed some porcelain.\n- In the original you respected Mulan for her character development when she became stronger and her determination but on the movie she already have the skills.\n- I'm fine if they don't want to have Shang, a leader romance but they should just remove the romance completely cause it really felt unnecessary.\n- In the original they built up a friendship with the three guys, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling which made them first join Mulan after she got revealed and she used some features she learnt from her study on the matchmaking but this movie they got convinced straight away. \"You dishonor us, don't show up again\"... \"Okay, lead the way\". \n- WHY IS THERE A WITCH????

When a war is coming which the emperor enlists one son from every family. Mulan and her sister being the only siblings. Her father prepares to join but with his aging slowing him down. Mulan takes the family sword and armor. And joins the army to face against a witch army who is plotting to take over the Emperor. Similiar plot. The film is a little serious. Compare to the original which was musical and had talking animals. The film does lack the musical set pieces and talking animals. But it does pay some homage to those characters that may or may not disappoint hard core fans. The cinematography is beautifully done. Capturing the set pieces and settings. The music score is great. The action sequences are exciting and well done. A couple of exciting battle sequences that is well choreographed with the fighting and camera work. The cast ensemble is great.

            "content": "A fine disappointment.\n\nNiki Caro's live action Mulan (2020) is nowhere near as good as the phenomenal Disney animated original Mulan (1998). All the humor and music is gone, including Mushu, replaced with melodramatic war drama and bland action choreography that never feels gritty. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is so forgettable instead of the iconic Mulan songs, so that's disappointing to say the least.\n\nCaro films a few neat sword fights and spear combat, but there's no blood or convincing fights that feel genuine and not just stunt people going through the motions. Caro's direction is pretty basic and unimaginative. She rips all the charm out of Disney's classic for a boring 115 minutes. David Coulson could have edited this down to a tighter, gripping pace. I found this Mulan to be a shallow cash grab from the increasingly cynical Disney desperate for their next dollar.\n\nRick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Lauren Hynek, and Elizabeth Martin's writing is terrible. They take all the personality out of Mulan, opting for generic action cliches and Chinese Communist propaganda. There's no Asian heroine left, instead there's Chi magic powers like The Force from Star Wars and unrealistic action in a poor attempt at being different. Joe Howes' CGI is awful for the birds especially. \n\nI'd praise Mandy Walker's cinematography, but the fights are shot in incoherent angles and cuts. Walker's wide shots are okay, but everything looks too saturated. The Chinese countryside is entirely an ugly yellow or orange. Grant Major's production design looks like a cheap play or a television show. Too bad Disney filmed this next to a Chinese concentration camp. Anne Kuljian's set decoration looks bland, if colorful. Bina Daigeler's costumes are colorful with vibrant reds or deep blacks, but everyone does look too similar. I don't know why they needed 8 make-up artists as everyone has too much make-up that makes each actor look fake, when it's just them.\n\nI admit that Liu Yifei is the highlight as Hua Mulan. She's quite lovely and charming, but a bit cold at times. Her sword fighting and bamboo stick combat is fun, but she shines during some of the more dramatic moments. I found her easily the only likable part of Mulan. I wish Niki Caro got an even more charismatic performance out of Liu Yifei because she can clearly act. I hate that Liu Yifei chooses to side with China's Communist suppression of Hong Kong's protests for Democracy as well. It's repulsive that she's said what she did just for acting roles in China. I wonder how long her fame and fortune will last?\n\nUnfortunately, everyone else phoned it in hard for Mulan. Jet Li sounds half asleep as The Emperor, Tzi Ma barely reaches emotional realism as Mulan's father Hua Zhou, Donnie Yen looks bored as Commander Tung, and Gong Li appears to barely emote or care. Considering they are all phenomenal A-List talent, I am certainly saddened to see them barely try for Mulan. \n\nJason Scott Lee, on the other hand, tries too hard to be scary as the Mongol Warlord Bori Khan. He never blinks to seem fearsome, but it just looks weird. His make-up and fights are pretty bad. I like Lee from his roles in Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story and Balls of Fury, so I'm upset they didn't give him anything to work with for cool lines or combat sequences.\n\nIn short, Mulan (2020) is dull and disappointing, coming from someone who adores the original. I liked the lead actress, but she doesn't save Mulan from never feeling truly heroic.",

And that phoenix thing flying around looking more like a paper kite, when I first saw it flying in the air I swear I thought a kid was on the ground and holding it by a string. At least Mushu at some personality and funny moments. It's a Disney movie! What's so wrong about having legit funny moments? \n I was very disappointed that they practically rushed or didn't even show the scene where in the animation film she cuts her hair with the sword, picks up her father's armor and leaves in the middle of the night, they just brushed it over. I'ts my favorite scene!!! Does it make her less woman just for cutting her hair? And she just decides to reveal herself after fighting the witch? Maybe I did't get it. Maybe I'm stupid but I prefer how she is exposed in the animation, after saving them in battle and gets hurt. I think it causes more impact. And also she doesnt become stronger for working out, she already is stronger than anyone else just because of magic???? I didn't see her strugle enough.\nI'm sorry if I didn't get the movie or the female empowerment thing. For me the animation gives a much stronger message regarding that and the line that her father says  \"The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.\" it means a lot to me personally.",

She was so excited to learn that it would be made into a live action movie depicting the strength of character, fierce independence, and commitment to friends and family that was reflected in her hero.  Telling, was the look she gave me at the end of the movie which  reflected her disappointment at the retelling of the tale in an incongruous, often incoherent, occasionally ridiculous, and utterly superficial story.  Many of the components of the original would not translate well into a live action, but the story of a girl who broke with tradition to save her family, relying on herself at first, and ultimately those whose trust she earned, to save her country were certainly transferrable.  Yet instead of a hero who proves that, with grit and determination, she can achieve anything, we meet another princess who has magic inside that gives her the ability to triumph over evil.  It wasn't the story arc that built the backstory which would explain how amazing and unique her magic was that ruined the story, it was that my daughter, who once felt a kindred with Mulan, now feels nothing toward this fantasy that Disney re-imagined.  Great visuals, soundtrack on par, casting and acting all done well--though we could have done without the 'is it or isn't it real' phoenix cameos.  With all this, my daughter thought about it at length and ranted about how bad it was for days, ultimately ranking it as her least favorite Disney movie--and she's seen 'Return from Witch Mountain!\"",

Sadly, the film replaces the funny animation characters which promote the entertaining quality of the movie, Mushu and Cric-kee , with a phonex which is just beautiful and less harshly can be considered as a symbol or spiritual support. There are some small but noticeably illogical such as flying chicken and biased snowslide which only kills the Northern invaders. Additionally, the acting performance of characters is absolutely not up to bar. The other family members of Mulan fail to truly express worry, anxiety and care for her and unfortunately, it makes them become so ignorant and indifferent. At least, in the animation movie, the father of Mulan can express a deeper sorrow by sitting under a tree to wait for her reunion, The development of characters and performance of main characters is also incoherent despite the collaboration between famous actors. Mulan fails to express a wide variety of emotions in certain situations but remains in the same. The Witch is too powerful and basically invicible, therefore, I expect a longer and more energetic fight between her and Mulan but there is no such thing. Her mental strength is just unusually weak, constantly begs to merge with Mulan and repeats the a same message of the unequality that women had to suffer in the society. It is perfectly fine and ideal if this message is underlyingly shown but it becomes so forcedly unnatural. The close teammates of Mulan are portrayed to so weak and do not have enough opportunities to bond and comprehend each other during trainings. Bori Khan is too dependent on the Witch to take control of the Empire. This once again makes the femine message so unnatural. However, the movie successful brings out all neccessary feelings when watching an action film as well as open up the vast and magnificent nature.",

Its the kind of movie that is very emotionless and you don't really think or care about it afterwards. However, this live action remake does a lot of things correctly by changing some of the key plot points and adding some interesting new characters the witch for example. Whereas the previous Disney remakes were almost a complete plot Ctrl C&V of there predecessor. The visuals along with the production & costume design were all great. Overall this is definitely my favorite Disney live action remake so far but still banks quite heavily on the original with characters and some plot points and is still an unnecessary cash grab and in my opinion a 5/10 film!",

But this new Mulan was born with Chi a power that makes her a naturally skilled fighter, this made her deeds less inspiring and admirable because it appeared that she was just a normal girl without her powers and it also gave me an itch that said Disney doesn't think a woman can beat a man without powers. Watching Mulan use these powers was kinda like watching a guy play a game with cheat codes, they win but its not that impressive because anyone would win if they had those cheats\n\nMy 2nd problem with the movie was the lack of character development, this movie had literally Zero character development for anyone, not even Mulan got an adequate amount of development, all she did was get tired of lying. Her friends from the original Disney animation were replaced with some random soldiers who barely said or did anything to make them stand out, if one of them died or got replaced half way through the movie i wouldn't have noticed because they gave me no impression whatsoever, even the guy who was a technical love interest got no development, apart from smiling and saying something nice in most of his scenes, he wasn't anything special, i legitimately think Mulan only liked him because he was tall and Handsome, and thats surprising from a studio that preaches true love in all its princess movies, the family was a generic family, the dad was ok, the little sister hated spiders and the mum was just existing for fun.\n\nMy 3rd problem is a more personal one as it is related to my childhood. Where was Mushu? Musu was a very important plot device and comedic relief and they decided to replace him with some dumb bird that was there to represent some kind of symbol i guess. I didn't like that, without a sense of humour the movies darker elements are more visible and people especially kids can tell that you just showed Mulan kill several people in a PG movie. I assume that Mushu was removed from the movie because of chinese censors, these guys need to learn the value of humour in movies because what they're currently doing to Hollywood productions ruins a writers ideas and destroys good movies. \n\nMy 4th problem wad the lack of music, the music in Mulans original movie adaptation was gold and i was honestly looking forward to it, but Disney decided to ditch their Disney princesses should sing philosophy and kept it all raw and Natural, and this would be ok, if everything else was perfectly executed which it was not. \n\nMy 5th and final problem was the villains, more importantly the witch, for some reason Disney was trying to make this character that was killing innocent men and women, relatable they gave her a simlar past to Mulans about how she was judged and labled a witch because of her chi based powers and i don't know why Disney was trying to make us feel sorry for thi evil and sick person, it takes a really stupid person to feel sorry for someone like that.\n\nI actually have alot more to say about the movie but my fingers are tired and its 10pm.\nI feel like I've only said negative things about the movie so I'll just type a few positive things. \n\nThe movie had amazing visuals. Apart from the emperor everyone had solid acting skills, the CG was ok, Mulan was a beautiful, the fights were mostly well choreographed, and  that's it",

However this movie was not the Mulan that we all enjoyed as kids, Disney went out of its way to write an inferior plot in my opinion, unlike the original this one has more fictional elements, and that ruined it for me, the original 1998 Disney animation had elements like Mushu and the ancestors which were fictional, but it still managed to ground itself in reality by limiting the fictional elements to the mere existence of those beings and nothing too beyond that. But this movie had magic, people scaling walls using their feet, and instead of a girl who used her brain, wits and relied on her friends to save the day, this version of Mulan is just a fighting machine doped up on the indestructible power of Chi, it has way less character development than the original, most of the characters were blank slates and very unrelatable compared to the original. If you never watched the original its very hard for you to think of any of the elements this movie is lacking, but as a person who has watched the 1998 animation i just couldn't fully enjoy this movie. \n\nI was also pissed off personally because Mushu isn't in this movie and it has no singing, in my opinion all Disney princess movies should have singing, it just feels like a huge part of the Disney princess brand. But those are just my personal thoughts.\n\nI initially wanted to give this movie 1 star, but out of appreciation for every good thing about it, i added 2 more.",

They made her lose anything that made her relatable and appealing in the first place. The action was bad and filled with cuts. The \"Twist\" is blindingly obvious once you even see Mulan and one other character. \nThis is actually the 2nd worst Disney Remake, at least most of the others experimented with new things, this just took away and took away until there was nothing decent left. I streamed this online for free and I still feel like Disney robbed me of my money. This was a bad movie on every level. If you want to watch Mulan, stick to the 1998 animated version.",

Que porque pudieron poner otra clase de personajes y no a mushu o las canciones.\nY esto es válido, porque estamos encariñados con la versión animada. Cinta que por cierto no gusto mucho a varios espectadores chinos, por aspectos en la historia que no tendían como tal tributo a la cultura china, las canciones la época entre otras cosas que logre leer. \nY bueno este año tenemos la nueva MULAN, siendo un poco mas apegada a la leyenda.\nY básicamente nos narran la historia de Mulán, una intrépida joven quien lo arriesga todo por amor a su familia y a su país hasta convertirse en una de las mayores guerreras de la historia de China. Cuando el emperador de China decreta que un hombre de cada familia debe servir en el Ejército Imperial para defender al país de los invasores, Mulán, la hija mayor de un condecorado guerrero, decide ocupar el lugar de su padre enfermo. Haciéndose pasar por un hombre, Ya estando ahí, se enfrenta a constantes desafíos y debe aprender a canalizar su fuerza interior y a aceptar su verdadero potencial. \nLo bueno \nEl mensaje mulan es de esas historias en las que nos las cuenten de la forma en la que nos las cuenten, tienen un mensaje lleno de fortaleza, es de esas historias que inspiran.\nY engo que ser honesta de momento cuando se anunciaron todos los cambios que esta película iba  a tener con respecto a la versión animada, me desanime, como asi que mulan no seria un musical, y no tendríamos al poderoso el simpático, el indestructible mushu! Pero bueno me propuse el verla y apreciarla….\nMe gusta que esta cinta es que no es un remake como tal, es como un homenaje y una versión distinta de la misma historia lo cual puede representar cierta decepción para algunos, pero en lo personal algo que creí que me iba a molestar era precisamente esto y para nada, me gusto esa revisión que le dieron a la historia.\nY esto nos lo dejan claro desde su inicio cuando arranca la película y tenemos al padre de Mulan diciendo Ha habido muchas historias del gran guerrero Mulan, pero antepasados, esta es mía\".\nYa esto deja claro que evidentemente no es lo mismo que vimos en la versión animada.\nEsta nueva versión tiene mucho talento de actuación a un buen nivel, hay batallas emocionantes, y es aquí en donde puedo destacar que desde su inicio mulan grita que fue hecha para la pantalla grande. Visualmente es impresionante, es grandiosa, y es una pena que las circunstancias la hayan llevado a la pantalla chica.\nTodos estos escenarios grandiosos y las batallas heroicas realmente te transportan a toda esa cultura de china, sus tradiciones y sus valores hicieron emocionarme y mantenerme expectante de lo que podría suceder a pesar de ya conocer la historia.\n¡Y para todos aquellos que crecimos con la versión animada si estas dispuesto a verla tendrás que ajustar tus expectativas, pues en lugar de un dragón tenemos a un ave fénix como guía de mulan, lo cual me parecio extremadamente maravilloso!\nPor otro lado tenemos la interpretación de la actriz que le da vida mulan tan carismática para ser perfecta para el personaje, le brinda elegancia, le brinda poder al personaje, mulan es la heroína que rompe los estereotipos impuestos en su época. y que tiene que abrazar quién es.\nY me gusto que podemos encontrar muchas referencias a la versión animada, incluso en la banda sonora, si prestan atención inevitablemente se te escaparan los tarareos de las letras de la versión animada.\n\nLo malo \nLa bruja, un personaje psicológicamente lastimado, rechazado que busca aceptación, como que no logre conectar con ella, lo sentí un personaje sin matices, hasta donde podemos ver en la historia, ella resulta ser una ventaja para los invasores,  se convierte en un ave y también pelea y tiene este tipo poder xmen de mistic, convertirse en quien ella quiera ser. No culpo a la actriz, si no al guion que siento no se presta para darle variables al personaje. \nTenemos un villano plano, que si bien en la versión animada imponía con su presencia en esta ocasión tenemos esa carencia en el personaje de ambición en su objetivo, si senti que a sus secuencias les falto fuerza.\nPor otro lado si bien la banda sonora no es mala, si le falto lo que a la animada no, desde la escena en la que Mulan toma la armadura de su padre, y emprende a la guerra, no olvidamos que toda esa secuencia esta llena de poder y en esta versión si siento que falto esa potencia en el soundtrack que nos hiciera vibrar con la historia con lo que estábamos viendo\nAdemas, MUlan falla en el ritmo en el que nos cuentan la historia saben, se siente apresurada y al mismo tiempo lenta.\n\nComo conclusión\nMulan no logra replicar la magia del clásico animado pero logra que nos metamos hasta el fondo en el espíritu leal, valiente y honorable de la historia, para ver esta historia en definitiva tenemos que redirigir nuestras expectativas y disfrutarla como lo que es una historia contada desde una perspectiva diferente.\n\nMi calificación para Mulan 2020 son 3 aplausos de 5",

With her seventh feature, writer/director Niki Carro has crafted an astonishing live-action adaptation of a beloved animated film. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to bring Disney's beloved animated classic to the big-screen, but she pulls if off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Carro draws viewers into the world of a Chinese woman on a quest to become a warrior. From intimate close-ups to gorgeous establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's cultural setting. Carro's decision to exclude the musical sequences from the animated film is risky, but it works tremendously. It gives the film a somber and realistic tone that is missing from the animated movie. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is excellent. Yifei Liu delivers a star-making performance as Hua Mulan. With riveting expressions, she conveys the courage, determination and heroism of the iconic animated character. Although \"Mulan\" is undeniably enthralling, ultimately it is not a flawless film. The film is so focused on its battle sequences that it often loses sight of telling a compelling story. Moreover, it lacks the strong character development of the original animated classic. Nevertheless, fans of the beloved Disney cartoon will definitely enjoy \"Mulan\" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. Arriving on the 22nd Anniversary of the cartoon, it's a stirring reminder that tales of Chinese women are worth retelling on the big-screen.",

Aside from the breathtaking shots of China's natural beauty, there's nothing worth watching here.\n\nMulan gets superpowers in this movie. Her victory is no longer a victory as an ordinary woman, but as a woman with superpowers. It really muddles the message of the film, especially since her feminine traits have nothing to do with any of her successes here. Instead of beating her trials with wit and patience, Mulan uses her chi to brute-force her way through them. I guess since I don't have superpowers, I'll never be able to measure up to a man. I'm really confused as to why they took out all the problem-solving pieces of the original and replaced them with less interesting versions.\n\nThere's also a really weird, pro-imperial vibe that doesn't fit well with the emperor himself in this movie. The emperor acts more like a vengeful dictator than a wise, caring man. Since they also took out the parts of the movie that show the villain's brutality, it's uncomfortable when Mulan is so staunchly on one side of the conflict.\n\nFinally, the dialogue is awful. It's a stilted, boring mess that the actors can hardly even deliver. There's no personality in any of it.\n\nThis doesn't even mention the human rights violations and the concentration camps in China. If Mulan 2020 was any good, this would still be a horrible taint on it, but it wasn't even a decent film. Seriously, how was this garbage produced?",

The main character's struggle with her deceit was so well realized, but ultimately her possession of Chi basically made her a Mary Sue and effectively rendered the movie's feminist message pointless. It is to be respected how this remake is changed significantly from the original movie, though, and the best new addition has to be Gong's Li witch character who is so well written and easily the most intriguing part of the entire feature. The action is serviceable, but rarely reaching martial arts wuxia levels. Technically speaking, the film's a treat with great visuals and a strong score. It's overall competently made through and through, but it was rarely truly great or memorable. On a side note, the overwhelmingly present themes of the importance of your family and nation made the film very Chinese in its values, which makes the movie's failure at the Chinese box office even more of a significant blow.",

I don't really care if I can tell that the movement is done with wires and the creatures are digitized... I much rather the story and acting to be on point.

This is a guaranteed way to easy disappointment. This movie is done with more focus on the story being historically appropriate and grounded in traditional aspects of the story. Keep this in mind and you will probably enjoy the movie. I managed to approach seeing this movie without bias of the animated classic thanks to the early reviews I saw and read. That’s when I noticed almost every criticism had to do with how it compared to the animated release. Most of the favorable reviews tended to be from this movies own take of story of Mulan. Do yourself a favor, don’t watch the movie expecting the animated movie reshot as live action. This is a new telling with a different take and dynamics. Clear your mind and watch it for what it is and you might find you like it. It has some different elements and events to put it’s spin. So be open minded and you might find a lot to Like.",

In my opinion all of the characters that played central roles in this film had an emotional connection to each character that made their performances believable, but more then that it made their performances enjoyable to watch. The actress Liu Yifei played the character of Mulan with depth and conviction that showed she truly took the role seriously. My whole family loved the movie, including my teenage daughter and son. We can't hardly get my teenage kids in the same room together let \n alone to watch a full movie together lol. So that's also how I grade the likeability of this film, because if my busy teenage kids literally stopped everything (including putting down there phones) to watch a Disney movie (especially during these times) then you know that they are truly enjoying the film. So, as I stated before, everyone has their own thoughts, and opinions on what they like/dislike when it comes to many different aspects in life. Cinema in my opinion is no different. I believe this film was a beautiful live action remake that will complement the Disney franchise for many years to come & I cant wait to see what else Disney has up its sleeves for the future.",

Performance wise, the movie itself was lack luster, Liu Yifei playing a disappointing main character, failing to give her character any life whatsoever. Editing wise, the shots feel quick, and scenes where emotional qualities should have shined through failed to do so. Lack of comedic relief and a literal witch added into the movie strip the film of it's Disney and more importantly, it's Chinese identity, while lack of diversity beyond the big screen itself prove to be the epitome of representation of diversity purely for a money grab.

With 200 million USD, one would hope at least a decent technical execution, but the editing is so bad I wonder where all that budget went. The sfx are not bad but not good either, hoped more for 200 million. \nIt boasts being more 'adult' and 'culturally accurate' but it isn't. Apparently the 'adults' would have difficulty understanding the scenes without obvious in-your-face dialogues and useless narration. For an 'adult'-take, the script sure is very cringey. The cultural representation is a joke, they even miss the point of the rabbit story from the poem, the costumes and the makeups are ugly, and they are not accurate. \nMulan is another Mary Sue born with superpower without any personality, the straight-faced acting doesn't help either. Chi disrobes the meaning of female empowerment entirely: if you are not born with powerful chi, then sorry, you are not a strong independent woman, you can only bring honour to the family by getting married. New characters introduced (witch, new love interest) can be interesting if explored more, but instead, we get superficial interactions. \nThe addition of phoenix is laughable, not only does it look fake (looks like a kite), it has no purpose to the narrative at all, aside from being a GPS. If the creators wanted to omit Mushu, then stick to it and don't give us this half-assed replacement. Changing the love interest from Shang to the new guy is weird and butchered the meaning of the character entirely. Again, the new love interest doesn't serve anything to the plot, better off without him. Side characters are forgettable and useless, unlike 1998's Yao, Ling and Chien Po who were essential to the narrative. \nThere are more things to say but this review is quite long already. Better off watching the 1998 version for an enjoyable, well-executed, nicely paced, mature, coherent film, or the many Chinese versions for a more accurate adaptation.",
