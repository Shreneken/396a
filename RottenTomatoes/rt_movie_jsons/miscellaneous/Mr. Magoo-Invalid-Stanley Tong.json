The beginning and ending of the movie is animated in the traditional UPA style with Mr. Magoo who is voiced by Greg Burson. I enjoyed that transition from animation to live action. I also enjoyed the first third of the movie as the plot was being set up. But the last half of the movie went off the rails with too much going on and some characters and plot just disappearing until the very end. There is a white actor who dresses up, in disguise,  as an Indian and that didn't age well. There is also the question of how Mr. Magoo represents blind people. The latter was less of a concern for me as that is the heart of the original cartoons. There is a disclaimer at the beginning and end of the movie addressing both these issues. I did have one big laugh in this movie, when Mr. Magoo was cooking a chicken. But there should have been more with Leslie Nielson as the lead. This may have been a director issue. They had outtakes during the credits and even they were not funny. Hard pass this movie.",

The premise isn't, at least in my opinion, the worst I've ever seen but it's certainly pretty lacklustre and messy.\n\nI don't actually think 'Mr. Magoo' is 'that' awful though, except for the scene featuring brownface of course.

And given that this was before the Alvin and the Chipmunks phase and in a world where these adaptations such as The Flintstones and the James Gunn-written Scooby-Doo features were at least trying to be good movies, that's saying a lot. Leslie Nielsen could've worked in the title role and he does look the part of a character whose design is impossible to 100% replicate entirely in live-action anyway but he's given such an awful script that it's downright depressing to see him in a movie like this. It's not too hard to see why this movie drew the wrath of a ton of blind advocacy groups. There's also a closing disclaimer which is sure to have people saying \"that's rich, coming from a movie whose premise relies on one joke: the title character can't see\" Definitely a low point in a subgenre that's already full of stinkers to begin with.",

But maybe the worst Neilsen and Disney comedy was the one and only Mr. Magoo.\nMr. Magoo, a classic cartoon about a blind elderly man, was never really funny to me or anybody I know. The one joke was all it was centered on and the formula for this joke, which wouldn't be funny in any cartoon, didn't work well. The film doesn't work any better, as Neilsen plays Magoo, a canned vegetable entrepreneur, who stops some bumbling jewel thieves along with his nephew Waldo. The film's jokes are so cheesy and old that it's near impossible to laugh. Magoo goes in several disguises in one scene and none of them are funny. The whole movie is a disgrace to the world of cinema, and that's all I can say.",

            "content": "Ah, this movie Mr. Magoo! Even though people think that this movie is a complete utter waste of time. It does have it's moments that make this movie funny. I can go through some of the bad first and then the good so it can please everyone. Mr. Magoo's first bad thing I would have to say is the cartoon opening. I don't know what it does for the movie except give us this classic funny animation, but to me it just seemed out of place and made the pacing of the movie weird in the beginning and at the end. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the director Stanley Tong's choice for making this film complete with a childlike mentality. It was like Tong was trying very hard just to appeal to children and no one else, this made the laughs between other characters not as good, it once again made it feel out of place like it didn't belong at all. The good about this movie is that for one there is a decent cast behind it...Leslie Nielsen, Nick Chinlund, Ernie Hudson, Jennifer Garner, Malcolm McDowell, it is a good list and they act pretty well despite the corny dialogue at times. Plus the story is, to me at least, engaging enough to see how a bumbling old blind man can clear his name from being a jewel thief and the actually crooks who bungled the mission because they were both going to turn on each other so they have to get through first to the accident prone Magoo to get it; which is quite funny. I also love the interactions between F.B.I. Agent Stupak, and C. I. A. Agent Anders as they argue over which one of them will solve the case first and receive all the acolaydes. Plus Leslie Nielsen is a little watered down as Mr. Magoo being that this is a kids movie, but he does have classic moments that only he can make which is when he is trying to sneak in to Austin Cloquet's headquarters to find out more about the diamond he accidentally had he has to become one of the nortorious gangster buyers Ortega Peru. Once he's inside he sees that all the mobsters have tattoo's and wanting to look normal he takes a magic marker and he draws one on his chest that looks ridicoulus, lol! Classic. So, if you get the time check the movie out, you may like it, you may not, but the choice is up to you. A 7 out of 10.",

Short length of the movie is a wise decision. Leslie Nielsen is indeed a master of silly comedies. Jennifer Garner also has a bit role. The story is about the rare jewel been stolen and the FBI and CIA thinks Magoo is behind it. Through bumbling here and there, all truth is reveal.",
