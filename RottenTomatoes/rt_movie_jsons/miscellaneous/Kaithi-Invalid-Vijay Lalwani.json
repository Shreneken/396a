KCK is the story of Karthik (duh), a timid man, bullied around by everyone who gets much needed help by therapeutic phone calls from himself. As bizarre it may seem to be getting calls from himself, which have no existence on his phone records, he decides to go with the flow and trust the caller. His life turns around in a few weeks. But all good things come at a price, and when he accidentally lets slip the secret of his success, everything starts unraveling. It's up to his girlfriend and his psychiatrist to figure out who is this mystery caller and is Karthik all right in his head. The execution of the second half of the movie is pretty good. If only the same effort and class was applied to the first half which is full of clich\u00e9s, lame songs and over the top acting by both Farhan Akthar and Deepika Padukone.",

First thing I did was checked on the internet but couldn't find any hint of this (to my happiness, surely I'll be disappointed if someone told me that it is a copy). KCK is a fresh flavour in an industry where outdated recipes are the order of the day.\n\nAll in all KCK is one more movie from bollywood this year that is worth watching. 4/5",

The sound waves made this out to be a horror movie, however this was a true blue psychological thriller.\n\nI am curious to know how this movie did commercially? The production values were excellent. A tight no nonsense script. Songs didn't seem forced.\n\nDeepika has come a long way as an actress and isn't as wooden as she was in her first movie. Farhan has done an excellent job portraying a below average Joe. Read \"loser\"\n\nStruggling to find a footing in life, both on the personal and work. Circumstances bring him to a cross road and a mystical voice intervenes. \n\nThis voice seems to be himself! Calling each morning like clockwork and coaching him to become a more confident person.\n\nHe turns the course his life is running. He gets his job back and professes his love to the girl he has pines for for the past few years.\n\nThings get edgy when he confesses his pep calls to his girlfriend who insists he get help. The phone god is miffed...he sets out to ruin all that he built. \n\nKarthik is out to pasture. No job, no girl and no money. Karthik decides to disappear, but how does one run from someone who is privy to every move Karthik makes?\n\nWell, he gets a stranger to buy Jim a ticket to an unknown destination. On reaching there he exiles himself in a room, relinquishing all knowledge of the outside world.\n\nIn time he steps out of his self imposed banishment. Gets a job and starts living again, barely. And then his boss orders him to get a landline! \n\nWatch this movie. It's one you can watch in the comfort of your home. The story is intriguing and not cliched. Doesn't pander to the audience with a strong heartbeat of it's own. Stay away if you like \"Govinda\" movies!",

Anyone can relate to Karthik in this movie, searching for anwers in one's life and feeling like the whole world is on top of you. Story is great and the acting by Farhan and Deepika is phenomenal.  Both of them get better with every single project they attempt, especially Farhan, a born director recently turned actor.  Even the actors with extremely small roles acted their parts to a T.  The songs in this movie were amazing.  Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have created a masterpiece with this soundtrack.  Songs like Jaane Ye Kya Hua, Hey Ya, and Uff Teri Ada will be on top of the charts for years to come.  The overall flow of the movie impressed me incredibly, as it moves smoothly the entire time.  This movie could have been so much worse, but Vijay Lalwani proved in his first production that he can handle an immense challenge.  What impressed me the most was the hidden internal symbolism of the rubik's cube, which in my opinon was a touch of genius.  I interpreted that the cube represents stages of Karthik's life, as when he is unstable and searching for answers, the cube is unfinished, but when he finally reaches peace in his mind, the cube is shown solved. I cannot even fathom how  incorperating such symbolism into such a complicated script is possible.  Lalwani has promise beyond directors such as Tarun Mankusuhani and, of course, Farhan Aktar.  Not a single flaw in this movie, as every scene and every diologue was handled with professionalism and every word contributed it's own effect to the movie as a whole.  Definitely worth seeing, and in my opinon, this production will be remembered for a very long time.",

My take: the audience simply didn't understand it..for the record I guess even most of the critics didn't. \nKarthik calling Karthik is a fantastic film, an eerie urban-nightmare that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrific for the most part. Farhan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s restrained performance is sure to win him accolades. The only thing that I didn't particularly like, was the detailed explanation at the climax, leaves very little for us to decipher on our own.

Well, I can honestly say to all those people who made those remarks that not a SINGLE ONE of those comments held true.  \n\nI just finished watching this and, after a spell of watching a lot of crap movies, I feel like I've finally seen a movie that was WORTH watching.  Mind you, I can't say the storyline wasn't slightly predictable.  But who cares?  The point is that, despite the fact that I predicted the story from the beginning, I was still held captive throughout.  \n\nFarhan Akhtar was so natural as Karthik - I really love this man as an actor.  He has a very effortless way of portraying his characters.  Deepika Padukone looked GORGEOUS.  I love this girl in general.  She looked great and acted very naturally as well.  \n\nThe songs were good, especially \"Hey Ya\" and \"Uff Teri Adaa,\" which were fun to watch.  \n\nThis is definitely worth a watch.  It's a movie that actually requires some sort of concentration and intelligence.  Much better than the other films released this year.",

Farhan Akhtar is very talented actor and director. Its really good to watch his movies. Deepika doesnt create any history but she is good. Her movies are always different like Love Aaj Kal and now this. Music of this movie is ok but doesnt do much for the movie.

But as the movie progresses you realize that this is after all an Excel Entertainment banner under which all films tend to promise a different experience but end up getting commercialized. However, let me give credit where credit is due and start off by recommending that you watch this film. Multi-talented Farhan Akhtar delivers his best performance to date, Midival Punditz and Karsh Kale rock the background score, Varughese's selectively lighted dark photography is visually stunning and Lalwani directs the suspense filled sequences with confidence and conviction. The use of Rubik's cube to indicate Karthik's state of mind and happiness is quite masterful. The problem with KCK however is that it doesn't stick to being a dark thriller. Instead, like any other mainstream film it ventures into colorful happy romantic moments filled with songs and lame attempts at comedy with a supporting cast that overacts (Ram Kapoor). If this film were to stick to its genre and emulate films like 15 Park Avenue and Being Cyrus it would have been a lot more thrilling, gripping and mind twisting. To me KCK is a classic example of an indie script that got stripped of its potential due to production under a commercial banner.",

            "content": "What if you got a phone call from yourself? Writer-Director, Vijay Lalwani presents an innovative concept with his debut film, Karthik Calling Karthik. Congratulations to his producers, Excel Entertainment (Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar) for always trying something new, whether it works or doesn't. Karthik Calling Karthik is an interesting thriller that could have been much better with tighter editing and maybe a better climax.\r\n\r\nKarthik Narayan (Farhan Akhtar) plays an introvert whose existence goes unnoticed at work unless someone has to shout at him. He likes a girl in his office, Shonali Mukherjee (Deepika Padukone) but is obviously too shy to even respond to her when she accidently acknowledges his presence. In other words, he is a complete loser. His life changes when he gets a call from Karthik Narayan; yes, that's him only. I have to admit that the basic premise is extremely interesting and throughout the film there are situations that surprise you. I will not reveal the story any further as that would take away from the experience.\r\n\r\nFarhan is good as a middle class working professional who aspires to succeed at work and also go out with the most attractive girl around. Deepika looks great with a new hair-do (something that all actors get in a film produced by Farhan... good job Adhuna!); she may not be a great actor but has good screen presence. What is good is her choice of characters of strong, modern Indian women. Shefali Shah has a short role that does not do justice to an actor of her caliber (Gandhi-My Father, Monsoon Wedding).\r\n\r\nThe music is just about fine (Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) with 'Uff teri adaa...' becoming a chartbuster; it is a nice song and is shot well. Other songs were not really required as they stretched the narrative. In the technical department, editing could've been better as the film starts sagging especially in the second half. That's where I blame the screenplay too; there is a very interesting build up but not so exciting resolution. That's a problem which a lot of filmmakers face, where they do not know how to conclude a good plot line; Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is another example where the film completely crashes towards the end.\r\n\r\nOverall, you can give Karthik a call but don't expect to be wowed.",

Imagine being in a rock concert that kicks-off with a fiercely elevating (and an unusually long)drum-roll only to find yourself witnessing a trashy cover version of some old country song in the end. It seems less deceitful and more of a bad joke. So don't be surprised if you find yourself asking this question by the end of KCK: \"Is this some kind of a joke?\". A bad one at that!\n\nKCK a suspense thriller with a thin yet handsomely adapted streak of romance deserves applause for its contemporary take on an old fable. Technically, the film is a deadpan(meaning critics might like it). But on a creative note, new comer Vijay Lawani's take on psychotic lives of lonesome yuppies will prove to be the wicked riff he managed to successfully record in his resume. A good start and a great future ahead more for him than his invention.\n\nNow KCK could have easily lilted on to a negative rating based on its story line but with endearing actors such as Farhan and Deepika, even a stale story can at the least on the surface appear tasty. Deepika portraying Shonali, the free-spirited, cutely sensual metro muse delivers a performance worthy of a speechless nod. She may not have planned to make a statement exactly but we read her anyway. She can act and she has it in her. Farhan portraying a pathetic wuss who has lost all zest for life, makes his pathetic character naturally charming, and somewhat of an enigma. The chemistry can be seen, heard and felt. If not for them KCK would have been every connotation I've mentioned: A bad concert, a let down and a REALLY bad joke...",

Karthik calling Karthik is farhans 3rd film as an actor and now im sure that he should stop acting( i gave him green card for his first two performances). KCK is unbearable for first half. Good music and Deepika's long legs give you some strengths to survive it but its really boring. Second half of KCK is not that bad, even movie gains some pace after intermission. This half an hour part is really interesting instead. But again after this half an hour movie looses its energy. This time you even dont get to see Deepika much(sadistic part for guys like me). KCK mainly fails due to its sappy screenplay and really kiddish direction. Vijay Lalwani simply sucks as a director. Cinematography on the other hand is good for some sequence (Use of black and white reminded me of tarantino's 2000 era). Overall KCK is just for juvenile audience who just like loud music and some silly twist in movies. Even if you dont have anything to do, dont waste your time on this one, ull regret it at the end. IM iving it 1 and half star just for shankar ehsaan loy's amazing music and Deepika for being this hot (though her acting is as awe-full as Vijay's direction, you dont give a damn",

            "content": "Firstly, it's refreshing to see movies like this churned out by Indian moviemakers. A psychological thriller. Not the usual fare the Indian audience is used to. \"Karthik Calling Karthik\" is an unusual mix of drama,a whole lot of thrill, and that subtle sprinkle of romance. None overdone.\nThe story revolves around Karthik (Farhan Akhtar) a submissive, run down guy who is pushed over by almost everyone around him. He can hardly talk for himself, leave alone express his feelings to a girl he is smitten with, Shonali (Deepika Padukone). And all this apparently roots from his guilt for causing his sibling's death in their early years. When things go worse after his futile attempts to stand up for himself, he crosses his threshold of patience and optimisim and gives up. When he receives a mysterious phone call; from himself. What follows this happening is quite a roller coaster ride. Pulsating between the mental highs and lows of Karthik.\nThe best part about the movie is it's pacing and it's plot. It seldom slips away or slows down. It actually rolls sneakily into a mysterious dark alley where it's hard for you to guess what would come next. You might find yourself wanting the story to go along a certain direction but you might be denied, but not disappointed. Fairly, there could have been so many climaxes to this story and possibly every one of us will want a different culmination.\nFarhan Akhtar is superb as the main protagonist with all his \"shades\". Deepika Padukone is definitely a pleasant sight and does well to play along; she is getting better with her histrionics. The supporting cast is apt; but surely Vijay Lalwani deserves some applause for his debut as a director and for his engrossing screenplay. And so do Karsh Kale and the Midival Punditz for a fitting background score that blends in well with the plot.\nAnd not to be disregarded; one of the best opening titles I have seen in a long while. It's brilliant; a late entry is defintely not recommended. :)",
