It surprises me how this movie is incredibly awful, mess-up, disappointing, and disrespectful to the original show. Writing is the backbone of every movie and this one couldn't make it. The plot was terrible and random, and almost every single idea and logic tried to imply in this movie is forced and nonsense. The level of funny business is more than enough to convince me this movie was a joke. I don't know what to say about the actors, they did fine but since the writing was terrible it can't be helped. Some characters that being introduced as main characters such as Ryuk. Ryuk's role is very important but, in this movie, I don't know why he even exists. I would say the characteristics of every character in this movie are completely different from the original series they are awful.  The dialogue between conversations shows poor writing. It doesn't show anything that it was smart and well-thoughtfully in dialogue at all, which makes me hate almost every character in this movie.\nI wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, I can't imagine any single type of person who will enjoy this movie because as a Death Note anime lover, it's disappointed me. And since the plot is messed up, non-sense, and thoughtless. So, I don't think it's going to work as a stand-alone experience either.",

I felt like it would've been better as a series and not a movie but then at that point it would've just been regular Death Note but live action. SO, all in all, the movie itself is great(still a bit rushed even as a movie) but as a reenactment of the anime it lowkey kinda sucked. \nLaKeith so fine so I'ma give it another little half a star.",

The actor choices couldn't have been better L, Light and gang had many moments of witty and seriously emotional interactions that definitely pulled on my heart strings once or twice. When Light told Ryuk to shut the bleep up I bellowed in laugher and soon after rounded in applause.

Light Turner (Nat Wolff) is awarded this power \u2014 which is completely random, I think? \u2014 and embarks on a mission of first, personal retribution, then worldwide vigilantism. I actually loved the \"Kira\" part of the plot, but understand there are only so many drug-lords and pedophiles you can smite with divine intervention before it gets stale. From an effects standpoint, Ryuk looked great. I love Dafoe as an actor and his iconic voice, but something about him voicing the death god became distracting after the novelty wore off. You could predict that the power of the Death Note would become corrupted, even if you didn't know exactly by whom. I didn't love Lakeith Stanfield's portrayal of \"L,\" the gifted, but \"quirky,\" investigator. I can't stand characters that do weird, awkward things just to make them different. While Stanfield's character didn't come close to Angelina Jolie's eye-rollingly idiosyncratic investigator in Taking Lives, he seemed to do abnormal shit just for the hell of it. That being said, I also think L is in some of the movie's better scenes and just wish his character had some minor changes. Watari's (Paul Nakauchi) quest to the abandoned orphanage was stupid. The ending twist just kind of hits you and sputters into oblivion. I don't think this movie deserves much of the hate it has received and found some components really interesting. I'm comfortable giving it a (65).",

He's an actual dumbass, very unlikable, and has no clear motive behind the murders he commits. Mia is also unlikeable in this film. She and Light have no chemistry at all unlike Misa and Light in the original anime. Also, can we talk about the rule changes? There are several changes but I'll give you one. In the original Death Note, if you touch the book, you can see the Shinigami. In this film, only Light can see Ryuk and no one else can, even when Mia touches it.\n\nThe overall script is plain terrible. The soundtrack doesn't fit with the tone. There is no character development and every character is just one-dimensional. Most of the acting is bad, particularly from Nat Wolff and Margaret Qualley. The only good thing about this film was Willem Dafoe's performance as Ryuk. Aside from that, there's nothing good about this film, and I will never watch it again. If you're new to the Death Note franchise and want to get into it, stay away from this film.",

Plus Ryuk's character and motivation were completely altered from the anime/manga to make him seem \"evil\"  or \"sinister\" rather than apathetic and aloof. Instead of the clever cat-&-mouse game from the show we get a bunch of idiotic choices and reveals from the main characters that leads into lame action set-pieces and an awful climax.

I do understand, however, that this film is loosely based on the series (manga), but to Anglicise a series that largely relates back to the Japanese culture seems like an absolute injustice. Not worth the watch if you've seen the series or read the manga, and if you haven't it should be nothing more than a background movie while you do something more worth your time.",

Little explanation is given for the appearance of an 8-foot demon, unless you're already familiar with the source material. The constant use of dutch angles made everything seem silly.

The character of Light is terrible, nothing like the original, a simpering lovesick fool. The battle between Light and L is pretty much lost. The worst crime though is the complete change to have the killing of the FBI agents being down to Mia rather than Light. Making her the scheming 'bad guy' is lazy misogynist Hollywood bullshit.

Even \"Mia\" is more ignorant and unlikable than the original \" Misa Amane\".

        {
            "content": "Death Note is one of the better movies based on a manga series, but it's still not very good. As someone who has never seen the anime, I watched the film hoping it would be good. And even though I haven't seen the anime, I was already familiar with the series and the concept long before a Hollywood movie adaptation was greenlit. There are certainly parts of the movie that worked, but I assume the parts that I liked have been done better in the anime.\n\nI enjoyed the cat and mouse game between Light and L. It made me understand why it was such a popular and beloved anime because it was so engrossing. The performances are really good for the most part, especially Willem Dafoe as Ryuk. Although he was underused, his performance was chilling and reminiscent of his performance as Norman Osbourn/Green Goblin in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man.\n\nThe movie has a little bit of dark humour as well. There's a scene where Light Turner screams like a girl that I thought was pretty funny, though this made the fans upset. Adam Wingard was also a good choice to direct the film. He shoots his films incredibly well and I don't really blame him for the film's shortcomings, even with Blair Witch (my least favourite horror movie of 2016) as he isn't a writer.\n\nUnfortunately, the writing is where the movie falls short. The film gives me very little to care about the main character. He's whiny, angsty, and even stupid at times, and it doesn't help that the lead actor was miscast. It also gives me very little to care about his girlfriend Mia (played by Margaret Qualley) and their teen romance. Mia is manipulative, annoying, and a little bit sadistic, and their romance is as by-the-numbers as it can get.\n\nThe soundtrack was also hit-and-miss. Adam Wingard loves his 80's style, synth-based music, and he previously incorporated this style in his film The Guest. The difference is that The Guest was a homage to genre movies of the 80's, so the 80's style soundtrack works with the aesthetic of the film. The soundtrack in Death Note has an 80's vibe for the sake of having an 80's vibe, and I'm pretty sure the movie isn't set anywhere near the 80's.\n\nThere are some logical and character inconsistencies as well, but my biggest problem with the movie is the pacing. Even though I haven't seen the anime and I don't know how many episodes there were in the show, Death Note (2017) felt like a TV show condensed into a movie that's 1 hour and 40 minutes long. It's very telling because the pacing was too fast. Light goes from testing the death note by writing a few names down to killing hundreds of criminals in minutes. The movie would've worked better if the movie was longer, as it needed more time to flesh out all of its ideas. Condensing all of it down into a short film makes the movie feel overcrowded.\n\nYou really need a fresh set of eyes to get the most out of this Western adaptation. If you're already a fan of the anime, chances are most of you will hate it. I can't tell you how good Death Note is as an adaptation, but as a standalone film, it's not terrible. It's not Dragonball: Evolution or The Last Airbender bad. Yes, I think The Last Airbender counts. It's not even Speed Racer bad. It's more like Ghost in the Shell bad, meaning it's really not that bad. The source material is more adaptable, and a Western movie adaptation isn't a terrible idea. The terrible idea is dumbing down the source material into a YA film and making odd changes to the source material.",

Misa Amane was kind of annoying but with her loyalty to Light/Kira it was tolerable, Mia Sutton is just straight up annoying and her and Light made zero sense together. L in the series is probably the most complex character. He and Light are almost one in the same. Their abilities to know exactly what the other is thinking and planning are really what make the series so great. this was all lost in the movie, I am a big, BIG fan of Lakeith Stanflied but him being cast as L just didnt make sense to me and made even less sense after actually seeing the movie, a bit of overacting on his part honestly. they could have done better",

            "content": "Death Note: 8 out of 10: Famous 37 episode Japanese Anime that everyone loves gets converted to an hour and a half movie that takes place in Seattle. Yeah, that is going to go over well.\n\nThere were three main complaints about Death Note pretty much at the time it was announced. They changed it so it isn't good anymore (Mostly around the character of Light), you can not tell a 37 episode story in an hour and a half (the Dark Tower complaint), and this is yet another example of whitewashing (the Scarlett Johansson/The Ghost in the Shell complaint).\n\nThe whitewashing complaint is a bit off for what is in actuality an adaptation of the Magna. But honestly, the Ghost in the Shell complaints already took that silliness to eleven. I recently watched the Ghost in the Shell anime and, strange as it may seem, the character of Major really does look a lot like Scarlett Johansson. It is as if the people complaining had not even seen the Anime they were supposedly defending. \n\n The Good: Strangely enough the only bit of actual whitewashing in Death Note comes from William Defoe who, I am certain now, was born to play a Shinigami (Japanese Death spirit). He has a more aggressive role than in the anime (Due to the protagonist Light being more passive) but director Adam Wingard wisely keeps him in the shadows. Which honestly is good advice no matter what role William Defoe is playing. Would have done wonders for Body of Evidence.\n\nThe other winner of most improved character over the anime is Margaret Qualley as Light's girlfriend. Channeling Kristen Stewart to such a degree that wives were hiding their husbands, Qualley is easily the second best thing in this adaptation. Her character is so much more interesting than her Anime counterpart that there is speculation she is an all-new creation despite sharing a similar name.\n\nAlso, say what you want, this is a handsome production with good special effects and a nice supporting cast. It also has a nice Final Destination vibe that adds to the fun in a way the Anime sometimes could not.\n\nThe Bad: The following is true: by the end of the first episode of Death Note, which is all of twenty minutes, Light has declared himself a God. The anime actually moves faster than the film. But, like the Scarlett Johanssen kerfuffle above, people's perception is different than the reality. People are claiming that the movie is moving way to fast for the material. Who is right? Everyone it turns out.\n\nWhile the movie may not, at least initially, move faster through the plot than the anime it certainly feels like it does. It is not something that can easily be put into words but the plot feels much faster.\n\nPart of this is due to the change of the main protagonist Light. In the Japanese anime, he was a jock and an assertive guy who used woman and glad-handed with adults. In the American version, he is scared to talk to girls and gets beat up a lot. So for the American version to get to the \"I am a God\" you have a lot more ground to travel. Invariably this causes the film to feel rushed even though it is covering the same time period.\n\nLight's antagonist L suffers the same fate in a way. We never take the time to see him solve small deductions so he comes across more as someone who read through the entire script rather than someone who is figuring things out based on evidence. \n\nThe film does seem to skip some of the show your work that it needed to establish these characters. Honestly, it simply is too short and too faced paced. It needed to be longer and take its time so one event felt more like a natural outcome from another event. \n\n\nThe Ugly: A homecoming dance really? I have chosen on purpose to not mention one of the weirdest and worst soundtracks in recent memory. I am of the opinion it was done on purpose. For what purpose eighties power ballads were ringing in my ear I am unsure but there must have been a purpose that I am unaware of. Nobody highlights the most emotional moment of one's film with Chicago's \"I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love\" unless there is a secret underlying meaning or perhaps a hostage situation.\n\n\nIn Conclusion: This is nowhere near as bad as some people made it out to be. Final Destination with a William Defoe demon? Sign me up! I wish it was about half an hour longer to help with pacing issues. This might be a Netflix corporate thing since the also cut the recent Outlaw/King about half an hour it really could have used. Overall a glossy fun picture.",

Its style is purposefully overdone and revels in that with conscious choice of cheesy music and acting. The appearance of Death God Ryuk and the blood-curdling screams early on establishes a schlocky, self-aware attitude that leaves it up to the individual to agree if it works. Familiarity with the Director Adam Wingard's previous films would only help better understand what he is attempting to do. He walks the tightrope of comedy/horror schlock in most of his films, and while there is evidence Death Note does the same, there is an underlying sense this project is handcuffed by studio notes instead of the allowance for liberal exploration of fresh and bizarre territory. It bleeds the question, \"what could this have been as a 13-episode miniseries?\" Death Note both fails and succeeds in cramming the plot points of the source material into a short amount of time while exploring new ideas but tumbles under its own weight, simultaneously entertaining and disappointing, exceeding and underperforming in its adaptation. I'm genuinely unsure if a straight adaptation would work better or be as enjoyable. Perhaps it works better as a summation of curious, ambitious ideas that either fall short or are lost in translation. An amusing, infuriating and intriguing mess of a film.",

This certainly isn't something that US production companies have had a lot of success with. Manga adaptations for the greater part tend to be more flop than failure in my opinion. \n\nThe concept of the movie is great with a book controlled by killing god, Ryuk ( who is excellently played by Willem Dafoe and his precense brings a little class to the movie) is left with protagonist, Light who trys to use his newly acquired powers for just and good. But, not everyone sees it that way and this leads to super detective, L, to try and find the person responsible for the wide spread murders of the worst people in the world.\n\nOn paper this concept already sounds a little ludacrious and has the potential to end in a final destination type movie that emphasises amazing deaths.  Instead the story is more focused on character development, which is rather minimal with characters more or less remaining true to their inital character other than one character who shows a more absorbed and ego-driven change.\n\nCinematically, this is shot beautifully and adhears to the stylised editing and effects found with the anime like movies. Think Scott Pilgram vs. The World. Heavy use of lilac in toning and colours and a bright anime saturation for even the darker colours. But for me Ryuk's character was by far the best as he was extremely accurate to the manga in how he looks. But, even more dark and ominous with a cool and captivating introduction to the character.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the movie quite a lot. There was a lack of depth to the story but this is forgivable as the movie was well executed for what it was, entertainment. It had a few laughs and was interesting, especially in the last 30 mins to see how they were going to bring a conclusion to this. Ending it on that cliffhanger sure indicates they have ideas for a second movie, which I hope gets made.",

While the original Death Note was not my cup of tea, its merits as a cat-and-mouse style drama was apparent.

I didn't feel like the movie had pacing issues or dragging with the story, everything happened and unfolded right away, which was a god thing considering that it became boring pretty fast. The actors performance was almost the whole time exaggerated and broke off the little immersion the movie had. It wasn't very fun to watch neither entertaining. Also the 80's-90's styled music felt too forced and didn't fir at all the movie's environment and it's dark vibe. But the visual effects really looked good so credit is due there. Every single decision in the movie felt without consequence despite it's dramatic ending, which you could foresee almost from the intrigue. Also the plot was awfully simple, and louzy, but at least it wasn't cheesy. There is no humor in the movie which concludes to the fact that it takes it's self to seriously. There is a stable conclusion at the end, but it's just not enough to save the movie. \nSo overall it's a painfully average movie, with almost every single main element being fundamentally flawed and broken. And my average rating is for the movie aspects only and not even considering the Manga on which is based on, and the accuracy of it, because then it would be a much lower rating.",

Mia is an absolute butchery of Misa, making her psychotic and hard to care about for even a second and Light sucks! They took a calculating mastermind and make him a cry baby who only cares about some girl. The movie sets himself up to be smart and then proceeds to make him do the most stupid things a human ever has in film, you'd think this guy was in a horror movie! Ryuk is okay, the costume is great but he's too involved in the plot, he does this because he is bored not because he cares. Perhaps the worst scene is the Ferris wheel, y'all know what I'm talking about. Again ignoring the anime and manga, it makes no sense and contradicts itself with the rules. At the start it is established that you must know a person's name and face to kill but suddenly Light controls Watari with his alias! Next, people can be controlled with the death note but objects can't, Light can't say the ferris wheel will break, he can't say the page with his name is ripped out and burned, and he can't say he will land in the water and survive as he can't control those who aren't going to die.\n\nIn short, this is a terrible film both in relation to it's far superior source material and it's own contradictions and too long plot. If you think this is good and haven't seem the anime, please do it is literally on youtube with english dubs. If you haven't watched this and want to, just watch the anime. I hate this movie.",

            "content": "So, I had seen the new 2017 take on Death Note that can be found on Netflix. My thoughts? Well....it's not bad. It's not good, but it isn't complete garbage either. I haven't read the manga or watched all of the anime series, so I can't really say how faithful it is to its source. As a movie on its own...it's alright. For one, this film takes place in Seattle, where Light's last name is changed to \"Turner,\" and whatever. It starts off like how you'd expect; a young man discovers a notebook upon which anyone could die if their name was written into it. And Light decides to start a crusade against criminals, using the guise of \"Kira\" to keep his identity hidden.\n\nFor the most part, the movie was decent. The concept of a Death Note was interesting, but it wasn't really delved on much. For one, you can control someone for a short time as long as you burn the page they're written on; once that is done, they are free to live another day. There are also many more rules behind the Death Note that are really complicated to understand as you're not given much time to digest them, but the idea at the very least is intriguing enough to allow one to continue watching.\n\nAs for characters. I'll be frank with you all: Nat Wolfe sucked as Light. He lacks any of the charisma and brilliance the original incarnation had, and he comes off as being more idiotic in his planning rather than being ahead of the authorities. In some scenes, Nat's performance seemed to be off...he really came off more as a brat than a mastermind. That's not even getting into how he screams like a little girl when he first met Ryuk. Willem Dafoe does a pretty good job as the apple-loving Shinigami. He's terrifying, yet devilishly comedic with his quips. Margaret Qualley plays Mia Sutton, the film's version of Misa Amane. There is a big twist behind her character, but I'll leave it secretive. Though besides Dafoe, the other actors didn't do that much of a good job. It probably had to do with the script, but I digress. Actually, L's actor was also pretty good, but I could probably say that you wouldn't like any of the characters when this film is over. Really, Light takes on the mantle of Kira because his mother was killed in a hit and run, and yet the film never gives you a reason to care about that.\n\nSo in short, as a stand-alone film, it's passable. However, if you are a massive fan of the manga, anime, or light novel series, you'd probably want to skip this one as it does chip away anything that remotely resembles its source material.",

The mentality of Light in this film is the antithesis of the source character. The actor who plays L had the mannerisms down to a T..... For about 10 minutes. Then the script kicks in and throws everything about the character into oncoming traffic and allows him to be unmercifully slaughtered. This is, hands down, the worst film I have ever seen in my life. Worse than Manos: Hands of Fate, worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space, worse than the worse Twilight movie, worse than M.

This book has a very dense set of rules, but the long and short of it is that as long as you have a person's name and know what their face looks like, you can write how they will die and it will come to be.  Now I watched this hot on the heels of Ghost in the Shell.  They are both American interpretations of very popular anime, so I figured that it would make logical sense to watch them in close proximity to one another, as I had easy access to both.  I feel almost identically about the two, even though one got a theatrical run and one went straight to Netflix.  Now I do feel like I am going to be echoing a lot of what I said in the previous review, but the same applies here as well.  I feel like this material would have to work better as a series, as they have no choice but to breeze over a number of plot points (I mean this book LITERALLY falls from of the sky).  I do think that this is a fun premise, and I am sure the anime series gives this story a lot more room to breathe.  As it stands, it feels like they are trying to cram 30 episodes into 100 minutes.  I also feel that this is another instance where nobody is going to be happy with this; I'm sure fans are going to be mad over so much being cut out, and everybody else is not going to find this to be accessible.  There are a number of small issues about Death Note that add up as this goes on.  There is a lot of spoken exposition on the front end, and while this book is a cool power, they never do anything with it that surprises you.  I felt that the demon, Ryuk, looks more goofy than intimidating, but that was before I saw screenshots of what the original looked like, and I now no longer feel that way.  I also had issues with Nat Wolff in this, or at least with how he chose to play this character.  He is not portrayed in a sympathetic light at all, but I'm not sure how much of that is the writing and how much is the acting.  This is shot well enough, but I don't know who this was made for.",

An American adaptation of a famous Japanese manga, starring Nat Wolff from the Naked Brothers Band as the main character, featuring popular 80's love songs. Believe me, it's weirder in the movie. The movie is very tonally off, can't really decide if it wants to be a serious dark drama, or a thriller, or a dark comedy. It shifts tone several times, going from goofy moments with the 80's music, then immediately showing large amounts of people dying. Doesn't help that the script isn't the most well written piece either. The film is all-over-the-place. The acting is also something not to boast about. Nat Wolff is not good as Light, playing a bumbling, goat-screaming idiot rather than a smart, cunning teenager. It's hard to take him seriously throughout the movie, and he definitely has the chops to act, he just didn't know what to do with this role. On the opposite of the spectrum, William Dafoe steals the show as the demon Ryuk. His voice weirdly lends itself to this creepy death God almost naturally. \nAnd of course, the 80's music is...out of place to say the least. Completely ruining some scenes and their punch. There's a scene of a character dying and a Chicago song plays and makes the scene laughable. Wingard definitely has a distinctive eye for directing, however, his direction is misguided here. And the ending...talk about a complete slap to the face to the audience! No resolution at all, it tries an open-ended ending, but that shouldn't excuse the way it decided to conclude it's story. You'll know what I mean once you see it.\nHaving said that, I strangely still enjoyed it. I never was bored with it. I was intrigued, even with all it's flaws. I think I am more intrigued about the story rather than the actual execution. I would like to see another, better attempt at creating a live-action version of this story because a great film is here, just hidden underneath all the \"meh\" and \"what?\"\n\n2.5/5 stars",

Director Adam Wingard shows he has a clear vision for his film adaptation, though for the most part it feels incredibly underwhelming, especially at how complex and investing the original Death Note manga and anime were. The film adaptation itself is reduced to being subjugated by plenty of petty little American tropes, campy cringe-worthy horror cliches and an annoying romantic subplot followed by plenty of over-dramatic moments and terrible soundtrack choices that doesn't compensate to the original source material. Performances from the actors were sub-par to say the very least, nothing too special or even broadly appealing to fans and non-fans alike. Wilhelm Dafoe however, is excellent unsurprisingly as Ryuk the Shinigami; its another one of those rare cases where you have a small element in the film worth seeing even with what little he has. Other than that, the film just wasn't that good at all, I'll give credit to the cinematography looking sleek and stylish, though it this film's Americanization it's losing the compelling and complex edge that made the source material amazing in the first place. It's all too easy to say it's overall; an underwhelming adaptation as it's an underwhelming film, I wasn't too surprised given the odd approach and the questionable choices to the various changes this film made in terms to the source material, it's doesn't stack up at all except upon scratching the surface and not digging deep enough.",

            "content": "I understand completely where some of the critics are coming from when they rate this movie so unfavorably.  I understand where some of the fans of the original source material are coming from when they voice their displeasure for how it doesn't live up to what they've had read and watched for years.  I, on the other hand, remove myself from all of that.  I wanted to take a look at this movie from an objective point of view.  I wanted to see it as an original creation separate from the canon it was derived from.\n\nAs its own entity I felt that the movie was very well planned out.  Knowing that there was an offer on the table for sequels it couldn't have played out better. Through the introduction to Light up until the finale of the movie, you're given just enough information and just enough time to get to know the characters.  Their moral convictions, the suffering they've all had to go through, their personalities, and the cat and mouse game between Light and L.  While I would have wanted more screen time dedicated to Ryuk, I can understand keeping him in the background for now.  Of course when I say \"for now\" it's based on the assumption that there will be a sequel.  I felt that the way the events in the story played out, it was a direct attempt to capture the attention of the audience just enough to keep them interested until more detail can be added in later installments of the series.  What they did is no different than how the Marvel powerhouse has been developing their story arc so far.  The universe in which those movies takes place is as far from canon as Death Note was from its source material.  Yet there seem to be little in the way of outrage for that as there has been from something adapted from a Japanese manga.  Regardless, I watch those movies with an objective viewpoint knowing that it won't always live up to the comics I spent my life reading so I never expect it to.  The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings series was exactly the same yet they were hailed as masterpieces even though, from someone who knows the novels by heart almost word for word, could easily see them as butchered misrepresentations of a brilliant author.  I let the movies stand on their own without any preconceived notions of where their ideas came from.  This is why I rated Death Note 4/5.  In its own right, it was fun, imaginative, dramatic when it needed, and keep enough from the viewer's vision to make them want to know more.  \"Who/what is Ryuk?\" \"what are the other rules?\" \"How are things going to play out between Light and L?\" among other things are some of the questions I had been asking.  The cliffhanger at the end made me almost demand a second installment just to tie up loose ends in my own mind (I have read the mangas and watched the anime so I know more about this universe than what the movie has provided).  I could easily see how, even though it seemed rushed, this was purposely done to just wet the appetite.  My personal friends who didn't even know what Death Note was prior to viewing this movie were enthralled and even hope for a sequel.  \n\nIt's a shame that so many fans of the series (and critics) have berated this movie without giving it a shot.  The fanatical cries of \"white washing\" were clear signs that very few would give any kind of objective or fair criticism of it.  It's clearly a smack in the face to the director and cast who in my opinion, while not being A list superstars, did a fantastic job.  I just wish that critics would let the material stand on its own without demeaning and objectifying it before it was even released.  I mean, could you imagine if someone tore apart the 1931 version of Dracula with Bela Lugosi just because it deviated so far from the original material?  Could you imagine even those who have read the original novel, shaming the author because it wasn't even close to a realistic representation of the real Vlad Tepes?  We might not agree all of the time, or even some of the time, but one thing that should be agreed on is that people had an unfair bias towards this movie before the release and it (as well as ALL movies) should be reviewed without bias.  Let an artist's work speak for itself and not where the idea came from.",

The transition to Light's evil mannerisms is too quick, and charactet development is lacking. The most intriguing moments of the anime are gone, and filled with really bad romance scenes. Ryuk, however, is played to perfection, and the special effects are quite good. But, in the long run, these don't help the horrible storyline that ultimately leads to nothing. Give this one a pass.",

            "content": "There's a talented lead and an interesting story, but it never really defines its own identity, getting mixed in with the rest of the generic films in this genre. \n\nLight Turner, a bright student who stumbles across a mystical notebook that has the power to kill any person whose name he writes in it. Light decides to launch a secret crusade to rid the streets of criminals. Soon, the student-turned-vigilante finds himself pursued by a famous detective known only by the alias L.\n\nSince going to college, the amount of movies that I've been able to watch has decreased dramatically. I've only watched a handful of movies since I've been here in Chicago. What a tragedy, right? Anyways, I want to start writing more and watching more movies. To start that, I've decided to start going through all the movies on my Netflix and Amazon Prime queue. First up, \"Death Note\".\n\nI had no knowledge of the origins of this story, which could be a good or bad thing. I went into it with fresh eyes and although I definitely didn't hate it as much as everyone else did, I didn't think it was that bad. This movie is definitely entertaining, but it's very by the numbers. Nothing here is different or new, and it all feels very cliche. I've seen the contents of this film in hundreds of other films, which is why this won't be that memorable. \n\nI think that Nat Wolff gave one of the better performances of his career here. I've seen him in only a couple of other things, but this was definitely the highlight of everything I've seen him in. He did a good job of making this character his own, and although I don't know the tropes of the original character, I certainly feel like he gave me a character that I learned to know here. As for the rest of the cast, I'll just leave it at 'they're iffy\". \n\nAnother problem with this film is the fact that no character is really likable. Everyone, from our main character, to his girlfriend, and to the lead agent on the case, they're all unlikable. They're all bad people in a sense, and none of their motivations or backgrounds really justifies their actions. It's a bit easier to root for Light because he is our anti-hero, our protagonist. However, you just can't help but hate almost everyone else. \n\nThe story is interesting at its origin, but I don't really think they did that well here. I can tell that the director and the people behind this production really tried to put something together, but it never really came together all that well. The story's pacing was good but as I stated earlier, it never really felt like it was different or new. It felt like there was a lot of content and a bunch of different ideas squeezed into a short run-time, while also never really giving us a reason to care. \n\nIn the end, this definitely isn't a terrible movie, but it's not a good one either. I had some fun with it at times, but it's definitely not one I'll remember in the coming days.",

            "content": "So, I (finally) managed to watch the Netflix Original 'Death Note' Film, and I must say that I was thoroughly uninspired. I won't go into detail about how much I hated the adaptation of such a masterpiece, but I will say that there were several HUGE problems, that pretty much ruined the whole movie for me : \n\n1) Setting - I won't even say much about this because it is pretty obvious, and I could probably write a whole goddamn paper on it, but the fact that they set the adaptation in Seattle, rather than Japan already puts the character developments at a great disadvantage. You have two VERY different cultures, that have very opposite social decorums, expectations, and values, and you try to make them parallels of each other, which honestly for me, is an improbable job. The true essence of the characters which relies upon how they act and react to stimuli is a battle that is influenced by their nature and how they're nurtured. So when the nature has already been changed, you no longer have the same characters; you can't strive to have the same impact or outcome.\n\n2) Light - The most amazing thing about Light as a protagonist is that he is a highly-functioning, intelligent sociopath with a God Complex. He exudes the image of perfection, and that is one of the many things that drives him to take this mantle of responsibility, because he honestly believes that he is without sin, and that absolutely gives him the right to judge others. But this movie has managed to reduce him to an emotionally-driven simpleton with a moral conscious. And that's the thing about Light! His ethics are his own, his moral conscious is his own, so as the reader/viewer you can go as far as to say that Light has neither a moral conscious nor follows societally bound ethics. Why would a god need to do that?!\n\n3) Mia - OMG! She was honestly the biggest flaw of this movie. To have such an intricate psychological thriller degraded to a cliched, fucked-up teen love story gets me so mad, that I'm not even gonna stay anything more about it.\n\n4) Watari - Who? The fact that they used this character as a loophole to get to L is such a cop-out. And I may have missed it, but I don't even think Light knew his full name, but he somehow managed to influence him.\n\n5) Ryuk - I actually enjoyed the character design for Ryuk. He was honestly a thing of beauty (props to the computer peeps involved), and I think as a Westernized adaptation, you couldn't have found a better Ryuk than Willem Dafoe. With that said, I really didn't like how they portrayed Ryuk as the one influencing the endgames to cause the maximum amount of evil for the major crimes that happen in the movie, when in both the manga and the anime, he is a pretty neutral character. He was just a super bored death god, who dropped his notebook to create a little chaos. The dude honestly just stayed for the apples and the show.\n\nTruthfully, this movie had the potential to be good, but it flopped for me. Why? Because I think the medium used is not enough to tell the story. If you're going to attempt to recreate a story as complex as this one, do a short-series, a multi-episode medium that brings out the layers of a story as interesting as 'Death Note'. The story is already written for you, performed and adapted for you, so make it better. Don't take away from the essence of it, especially if you're translating it across cultures; translate it well and thoroughly. Or they could have had Japanese characters and kept the cultural integrity of the story, but still set it in Seattle. Stop cutting corners to get an ending you didn't work to set up properly. \n\nP.S. I didn't forget L, I just didn't find any major problems with his character adaptation that ruined him for me, apart from the obvious ending. I think Lakeith played him fairly well. If they had portrayed him as a bit less human (emotions-wise), more neurotic and like the utter oddball that he is, his character would have been right on the nose. So these are my thoughts on this movie.",

Somehow LaKeith Stanfeild's L has all the answers, but we never see him figure anything out, he spends a majority of the movie sniveling when bad things happen, and he makes the smart choice to REMOVE HIS MASK TO KIRA rendering its use utterly pointless. Margaret Qualley's Mia is just some crazy girlfriend whose backstory isn't explained at all; does she even have a family or any motivations to kill? Many serious plot points are reduced to moments of bickering, like Mia trying to write Light's dad's name in the Death Note, or the final conversation in the ferris wheel. Little explanation is given for the appearance of an 8-foot demon, unless you're already familiar with the source material. The constant use of dutch angles made everything seem silly. The final nail in the coffin for this movie was the unnecessary robbery of roles for asian actors. There was really no reason L couldn't have been an asian character, he was literally speaking Japanese in part of the movie. This film is a shame.",

Ultimately, the ending was very forced and confusing; there was a romantic sideplot that did nothing, and characters - both the protagonist, Light, and the antagonist, L the detective - that completely switch out their beliefs according to plot dictations, with no clear motivations.\n\nBut I still enjoyed the film. It inspired me to work my way through the anime, which I did not enjoy hugely - mainly because it's anime, and the cheap level of animation really gets to me. I wish it wasn't an anime. \n\nHaving watched it though, I can now understand why all the users rated it so low. There's so much missed potential. The exploration of what true justice should be, is a huge part of the anime, that's not really explored in the film. Also, the battle of wits & logic between Light and L was my favourite part of the anime - it's sorely lacking in the film.\n\nReally, the ultimate version of Death Note remains to be made, I feel.

It's always hard to criticize something like this when you are a fan of the source material, and just like with most comic book adaptations or, in this case, a Hollywood adaptation of Japanese manga/anime/live-action films, when there are so many changes to its characters and rules, you can't help but point out everything that is wrong with it. What makes the source material fascinating is its ideas, its complexity and the psychological cat-and-mouse between Light and L. Wingard, although clearly trying his best, reduces all these ideas and turns it into a cheap gore-fest, completely dumbing it down for the people who are too lazy to keep up with its clever premise. Wrong move, Wingard. Lazily plotted and poorly executed, this version of \"Death Note\" is not terrible, but it is certainly a waste of time. Watch the anime or the first two Japanese live-action films instead.",

            "content": "Having never watched the anime it's based on, I will judge Death Note as a stand alone film. It's not good. Let's start at the beginning, Light Turner, played by Natt Wolff has a 'death note' mysteriously dropped into his lap and is visited by a creature named Ryuk, voiced by Willem Dafoe, who tells him that if he writes a name in the book, that person will die. After a rash of mysterious deaths people start to grow suspicious and Light's identity is sought out by a detective known as 'L' who wants him to pay for his crimes. There are fundamental writing and directorial issues with this film, the dialogue is extremely cheesy and expository from the onset and Nat Wolff's acting is so over the top and cartoon-like it's hard to take anything he says or does seriously. The characters have almost no story arc and no motivation for a lot of their actions, Light turns from a supposedly wimpy, nice kid to a murderous sociopath who gets off on killing in a blink of an eye for no reason. Mia, played by Margaret Qualley, fairs a little better as her character does progress and change throughout the film but again there is no catalyst for this change. The most interesting parts of this film are short violent scenes of the deaths that resemble Final Destination in their strangeness but unfortunately are not as well done. The one little ray of light, no pun intended, is Ryuk, Ryuk's appearance and voice are well done and he is certainly the most interesting character in the film. However he isn't given very much to do, most of his dialogue is expository and he isn't given nearly enough screen time for his character to be fully fleshed out. Overall, American film has somewhat of a history of remaking Japanese properties and completely ruining them, unfortunately Death Note is no exception. Now I would like to watch the original anime to see what everyone's raving about.",

He took a super awesome anime and quite successfully turned it into a full-length movie for us to enjoy. What are you comparing this version to? The cartoon? Things in cartoons do not always translate well into live-action. Take L for instance... In the Japanese live-action he comes across as a super mega cringe-worthy creep. Ew. It made me physically uncomfortable to watch it. In this new version, however, Mr. Keith Stanfield played him creepy but not overwhelmingly so. It was the perfect balance of L's personality without falling over into the abyss. I loved, loved, LOVED his performance. \n\nRyuk was the make-it-or-break-it for me. He is my favorite character hands down. And you know what? He was perfect as well. Super creepy, a really awesome design, and he retained his dark sense of humor. And that laugh. Holy potato! \n\nMy summary: no, it isn't exactly like the anime. In my opinion it's actually better. It shows Light transitioning from normal kid to a darker moment. It shows a weird, reclusive L on his trail. The ending is perfectly ambiguous. Does he(no spoilers!) do it? Does he not? Was it all a part of some hidden plan?\n\nI get the sense that the people complaining the loudest are the ones who didn't give this movie the proper chance in the first place.

Have to say, I wasn't even a fan of the original series having only watched the 2006 Japanese live adaptation myself, but I had to watch the anime after this as sort of an apology to the source material. This movie would've worked much better as a spin off rather than an adaptation. It would still have been a bad movie though. \n\nThe main character Light doesn't come even close to his namesake from the original. He's supposed to be a \"bright kid\", which is supposedly established when he is introduced, sitting outside and doing other people's homework for money. A decent establishing shot, sure. Problem is though, that literally e v e r y t h i n g  e l s e he does in this film is almost moronic. I am honestly surprised he didn't get caught faster, what with him having the Note out in the open at school where anyone could see it, like for instance the hot girl he didn't actually know properly before (Mia) who actually did see it, who Light then immediately showed its power by literally killing a person in front of her. Like, what the hell. It takes a special kind of moron to think \"I just introduced myself to a hot girl I know pretty much nothing about except that she's a cheerleader. Better show her just how cool I am by literally murdering a person and having her witness it.\" Also, apparently this one's motivation for killing is.... to get in said hot cheerleader's panties. That's it. So much for all that interesting justice debate and manipulation that made the original series interesting.\n\nThen there's Mia. Poor, underdeveloped Mia. We never really learned what her deal was to be honest. She's just sort of homicidal for some reason, and ironically has more Original Light's characteristics than Light Turner does (this one might have been on purpose but you never know with a script this terrible). We don't get her backstory for her and the motive could be a god complex kind of light Original Light's, though there was really only one conversation that would suggest that. Then again, she was compeltely out of nowhere ready to kill Light Turner's dad without batting an eye so... debatable, at best. She wasn't spared from the Stupid either, being forced to partake in one of Light Turner's Idiotic Moments: shouting about people they've killed in the middle of a high school stairwell. With, you know, other people in earshot since it is a high school and stairwells can be kinda cramped.  \n\nL had at least some effort put into his character, mostly by the actor LaKeith Stanfield, who did his best to recreate the character's unique habits in the first half of the movie. Too bad he had to work with this particular script. While L did have some moments of clarity, such as deducing that Kira needed a face and a name in order to kill, as well as recognising a Kira murder that was only broadcast in the Seattle area and thus pinpointing the culprit's location, he suffered from a severe Lack of Light. The original series was interesting because Light and L were equally matched in wits, and were both actively trying to figure out each other's identity by mind games and clever tricks. Here Light is too damn busy trying to hook up with a cheerleader that L has literally nothing to work with. Hell, when the two are finally on screen together, Light doesn't even try to deny that he's Kira, and then there's a bullshit chase scene and whatnot before the bullshit ending that's not even really an ending because apparently this shitshow earned a sequel.\n\nNow that the character rant is over, let's talk about the plot. At least the parts I got when I wasn't zoning out because of boredom. Ok, so we have this socially awkward outcast who like does other people's homework so he's kinda smart I guess? So he's sitting outside playing the easiest game of Spot the Love Interest with this one cheerleader who happens to look his way through a chain link fence, when this black leather notebook falls out of the sky right in front of him. He manages to read the words \"Death Note\" on the cover before convenient rain pops up and everyone's running to get inside except a couple bullies who run outside bullying a kid because plot.  Yea so our main kiddo gets really yelly at this bully and gets his Lights knocked out (I'm pretty sure that's where the character went to shit), but hey at least the Totally-the-Love-Interest cheerleader was watching so that's a win, right? \n\nSo then this smart boi gets caught dealing homework and gets detention and meets CGI Willem Dafoe, a very good performance stuck in a very crappy movie, and after a hilarious freakout on our kiddo's part, our kiddo commits his first murder. Yay! It was a bully though so it's ok. Plus this totally gets the Love Interest's attention later. After that we pretty much have a little character establising when the kiddo does this one murder that's actually for Justice instead of Panties. Wow so source material. His mom was alive in that though. Then there's stuff I already complained about before, the whole read note at school attract stranger commit murder thing and that was apparently character bonding cause around this time (I think it was around this time) we have a super awkward taking-off-clothes scene. \n\nThen our two lovebirds commit some more murder and Light decides their name should be Kira because Wingard doesn't speak Languages. Like, I'm not kidding, he goes on about how \"Kira\" means \"Light\" in like Celtic and Russian, and also \"pretty much 'killer' in Japanese\". Now I myself don't speak Russian but people who do have been like \"mmMMMMM yeah no it doesn't mean light though?\". Japanese I do speak and can tell you that yeah no, it's nowhere near any Japanese words for \"killer\". This might be due to the fact that the source material clearly states that the name was given to Kira (note: given, not named by Light himself) by Japanese netizens because it was close to the katakana pronunciation for the ENGLISH word \"killer\" (the pronunciation being \"kiraa\"). Be what it may, this was another entry into Light's Moronic Actions, because WHO CHOOSES THEIR SERIAL KILLER NAME TO BE THEIR OWN NAME IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE ARE YOU BEGGING TO BE CAUGHT?\n\nOk so enter L with all his quirks and stuff. He's pretty quickly on our protag's tail and puts him under surveillance and there were FBI guys and whatnot who I only remember because they got killed which spooked Light enough to get him to try to get L's name and face for a while, by, get this, writing Watari's name in the note and literally mind controlling him. Like I'm not kidding. The note has these two stupid rules where you can basically completely control the person who's name is written on the note for 48 hours before death, and save one person by burning a page (we never get an explanation as to what would happen if a sensible person who writes more than one damn name a page tried to do this). So his master plan is to get Watari to go to this weird facility and find L's records to get his real name. This works because apparently Watari's parents hated him and didn't give him a forename. Lucky Light. Who is still kind of a moron and now also manipulated by a murderous cheerleader so plan goes to shit and L loses his marbles and all his characteristics so far and becomes this emotional gun-wielding wreck. \n\nThere's some Edgy Teen homecoming shenanigans, Light realises he's being manipulated, pulls this Unbelievable Super Convoluted Plan out of his arse while running from police and L, arrives at a ferrish wheel, kills his girlfriend and apparently is super bummed about it (child, that is what happens to people whose name you write in the Death Note), the Unbelievable Super Convoluted Plan somehow works and he wakes up in hospital two days later and for some reason his dad who has up till this point believed his son is innocent is now convinced Light is Kira and like.... I'm honestly not sure if it was an internal monologue or Light actually talking out loud to his dad a POLICE OFFICER, but whichever it was we get a narration of exactly what Unbelievable Super Convoluted Plan consisted of, and then cut to L with a page of the Death Note that Light literally told him the location of (again, moron), and finish off with an \"ooo is he gonna use it?\" cut. Then there's bloopers in the end credits. No, really. What the fuck did I just watch.",

Cut it out.Anyway my point is I can understand a movie changing to relate to our understanding I mean this is America.Sometimes I want to watch a movie in English ok...fuck it I'm done with this.Hopefully you get what I'm saying.",

The death note anime delves into the right and wrong of the death note as an idea. Is killing someone who does bad deeds justified? While this is explored in this movie not to the same level. The bulk of the movie has to deal with Mia and Light falling in love over killing people.

He oversees the use of the Death Note and does not manipulate Kira in the slightest. The movie's version of Kira, on the other hand, is disgustingly inaccurate and irritating. Just like how they portrayed Misa, they were the complete opposite of who they should have been. I don't even have words to express how monumentally inaccurate L was in this film.

An inspired adaptation and alteration of something that already exists. So people are moaning that L wouldn't do this and Light doesn't do that (You know as if they're friends with the characters?) and it's 'white washed' (Already had plenty of Japanese versions with Asian actors, what's the point in remaking it without changing it?) but then complaints that L is black (Basically making out the film is racist for not casting Asian actors, tho I would argue to opposite, that those fans are racist for making the assumption that white and black actors can't play these roles). The film is great, it's enjoyable and importantly, it's different. It's not a carbon copy of the original which is great. It's an adaptation more than a remake. So, if you want to see a different story to the original, this is great, if you want to see the original story, there's 12 manga novels, a 37 episode anime series, 4 Japanese movies, and a 3 episode Japanese mini-series.

I can accept that a completely faithful representation of Death Note is not possible in a single movie time frame. It's too long and complicated, so shortcuts have to be taken. That's all well and good, but they could at least not contradict themselves within minutes. The most glaring of which occurs when Light reads Ryuk's name in the Death Note, then threatens to kill Ryuk by writing his name, and Ryuk responds that no one has ever been able to write his whole name into the Note.

Light is just too bland, too generic, and too willing to casually kill. He flips from mourning corrupt hermit to righteous wimp too easily. Ryuk also seems lazily played as just some sinister force. It's almost like Dafoe is reprising his Green Goblin role, minus the multiple personality.  \nFans of the anime would do well to think of this as a completely different series, as both Light and L are relatively stupid compared to the anime, Light being fairly emo, and lacking conviction and imagination. \nI would have rather seen Mia with the book in the end.

This movie was a welcome surprise after hearing nothing but negative reviews, and overall I thought it was funny and charming, not to mention the great cinematography throughout. The actors managed to portray believable characters who underwent believable story-arcs even though the film was only a short 1h40m long. This project was always going to be facing an uphill battle. Nothing is harder than pleasing a pre-existing, enthusiastic fan-base, especially considering the huge differences in the creative landscapes of anime and western-style movies.The anime had 25 x 22 min episodes to tell a similar story, so yes, the plot is significantly thinner in this movie, but I found that the aspects that the writers kept made for an intriguing and original twist on the source material. Another criticism that I have seen being thrown around was the \"whitewashing\" of the original story, but the western based company, Netflix, made a western movie for a western audience, and I thought the changes that were made were respectful and ultimately insignificant to the plot and moral. They even made a joke at the start addressing the need for changes as the american protagonist is unable to pronounce the Japanese name \"Ryuk\". Out of all of the stories that could be told from different countries point of view, Death Note has to be high on the list of most adaptable, as it shows the global impact of a single human, chosen at random, who is endowed abilities to create their own justice. This film's downfall was being too watered down and simple for the anime fanbase and too rushed for the newcomers, but considering how many HUGE pitfalls it managed to gracefully avoid during what was always going to be a problematic adaptation, I definitely approve the work that was done.",

They turn Light from a genius strategist with a strong sense of justice who manipulates everyone around him and isn't afraid to kill to reach his goals into an idiot who reveals the death note to Mia without a second thought and doesn't even hide his identity from L. They turn Misa from a girl who just wants to please Kira/Light who Light manipulates for the power of the Shinigami eyes into Mia, some crazy girl who wants to kill everyone and Light wants to bang. L just becomes a crazed lunatic, screaming at Light and chasing him down (maybe because Light basically told him he was Kira). Ryuk is outright evil now for some reason, perhaps because there was no antagonist and the movie creators were too afraid to make something like the anime/manga where there was no real antagonist. Not to mention the nonsense that is the ending, or the unnecessary changes to the death note's rules.

I'd say he acts like a typical teenager who doesn't understand the price for the power of the notebook, and his \"girlfriend\" makes it even worse and cringier because we're doomed to survive through (thankfully) short sex scenes and domination games which's medium is, of course, the Death Note.\nThe amount of well thought deaths in this movie is comical and when Light finally tries to do it right, he just uses one, cheap strategy 3 times in a row. \n\nI liked how one of Kira's followers helped him out. I liked the ending... well, maybe \"liked\" is a too big word, but I felt that the final scenes were the best thing they did in the entire film.\n\n\nI don't think the movie was good on its own either, I dunno if it could be called mediocre for today's standards, even.",

Perhaps I don't think this is so bad because I don't hold Death Note that sacred... Anyway, it had a rough start with the American High-school scene and all to rushed tempo but the movie gets saved by great performances from Willem Dafoe as the Death God Ryuk and Keith Stanfield as the private detective L. It also has a good final act and blends the movie \"Final Destination\" gore and humor (which was a hit and miss in times) with a little from the Showtime series \"Dexter\" (main protagonist Lights character \"suffers\" from the same serial killer problem). It gets the ok grade from me but I would like to finish and repeat myself with, please leave animes and mangas to be their own things. Everything doesn't need to be westernised or live-action.

If you completely ignore the absolutely blatant whitewashing that took place in the making of this movie, it would still suck.\n3. I think that Willem Dafoe and Keith Stanfield are probably the only things that make this movie even remotely redeemable (also the weird pseudo-Donny Darko aesthetic is OK. Not overly original, but there are worse things in this movie).\n3. Nat Wolff's acting was particularly awful?? Like the worst.\n4. The fact that they reduced a super cool thriller into a weird white people love story is sad :(\n5. The whole movie was extremely rushed and the characters super underdeveloped. (Side note: The whole cheerleader-but-also-super-edgy-girl trope is ridiculous and needs to not ever appear in any movie ever again).\n6. Again with the general aesthetic of this movie, I'm not sure when this is supposed to take place (some characters use flip-phones??) but the movie was making me feel kinda nostalgic. Probably because of the 80s music?? (Again something I think they included to give it the good ol' Donny Darko feel)\n7. The rules of the Death Note apparently changed during the movie because for the plot's sake I guess you sometimes don't need someone's last name to kill them???\n8. The gore in it was really kinda gross and unnecessary like the first two kills were so bloody and the rest were kinda meh.\n9. I had to stop watching it for a few days because the first 30 minutes are particularly horrible.\n@cinemasins lemme review this movie for you I hate it I can talk about how much I hate it for hours.

But glad I did! If you never saw the anime, Light personality won't bother you at all and you will might agree w/ the guy's viewpoint. He's sort of a weakling, turn dark hero type (for now). Ruyuk is great and it's easy to see why ppl assume he would be the villain of the story.\n\nSemi-spoliers/ Anime comparison:\n\nMia/Light:\nIf you watch the Anime, Mia in the movie is Light from the earlier episodes. The character of Light Turner doesn't actually start acting like his anime counterpart until the end of the movie. I think that's why so many anime fans hate the actor. I think they should have just turned Mia into Kira and have her kill Light or just taken her out completely. She takes too much anime Light personality and made Light Turner look like a love sick cry baby. If you watch the movie SHE WOULD MAKE A GREAT KIRA and a better adversary for L. \n\nPacing: I agree the pacing is not great. The worst pacing is L's intro to the world. Movie L character is really good, but I don't think ANYONE would take some guy wearing a mask (btw 16-20 yrs) seriously. It was kinda dumb.  In the anime, L public persona was Watari or he would video conference (only showing the letter \"L\" on the screen). Only the law enforcement he worked with met him in person. Also, the creation of Kira felt rushed, but this happened fast in the anime too. I think Light killed 30 ppl and was talking about becoming a God before Ruyuk had a chance to explain the Note to him.",

So much so that I'm gonna need to do an obligatory disclaimer before moving on for clarification and context reasons. And to start off: As far as the anime goes, I have seen it though that was about five years ago and I remembered liking it enough. And even for the release of this film, I decided on not watching it and reviewing it FAIRLY on it's own merits (especially since it's adaptation which if Warcraft has taught me anything I can enjoy a film if it's given good enough direction and vision to hold up well). And one last thing, Adam Wingard believe it or not is someone I like for Your Next. But after Blair Witch, a film that ruined almost the entirety and point of the first film and failed as a horror film, I was getting incredibly nervous about however wanted to remain unbiased and go into this fairly. Now, with those out of the way, let's get into this because...oh boy. \n\nI, tried really hard here guys to be fair to this film and had hoped that after Castlevania could do the video game adaption justice some good and make for an almost fantastic TV series, this could. Then the casting was announced that made me confused, and then the promotional material, and I got nervous. But regardless I waited patiently and what ends up happening? Netflix, 3 doofus screenwriters who wrote such iconic films like 'Immortals', 'Lazarus Effect' and no joke 'Fant4stic', and Adam Wingard told me that I should've never even bothered being fair to it. Because describing how god awful and insulting this film was would, well, take up a bit of length on this review. But, I can tell you the very little things I did like which was: Ok or fine camerawork and cinematography, maybe one or two jokes that worked, some decent conceptual ideas, and...yeah no that's about it. The rest is just about as negative as you could expect from: A godawful soundtrack that instead for opting for oh I don't know subtly and tension goes for a ridiculously out of place 80's style with pretentious choosings, an opening that essentially rushes out Light getting the Death Note and serving as a legitimate pointless introduction to a romance i'll get into later, the acting for once being all around either mediocre (L and most of the main side characters), wasted (Willem Dafoe makes for a surprisingly good Ryuk), and just over the top (Light's actor is so bad that it made me laugh unintentionally when Ryuk meets him at the school and he tries to escape. No joke I couldn't breathe for 5 minutes it was so bad), the characters despite Ryuk were all just so unlikable, dumb and just not even developed to the point that I can't tell any of them apart other than their stereotyped traits and forced plot backstories the story shares, a story filled with so much plot conveniences and cliches it's not even funny, a infuriating third act and ending, Light and Mia's high school romance being so goddamn unlikable and genuinely forced that I wished they could get off the screen, scene transitions filled with inconsistencies and overused dissolves, A.D.H.D editing that made me want to vomit, unnecessary gory violence, and so much wasted potential and issues that for everyones sake I'll stop here. \n\nDear god, what in the world happened to this film? I honestly wasn't expecting to hate the film way I did, especially since I never bothered watching the anime going into this, and I figured i'd find it at best mediocre. But my god, Netflix and director Adam Wingard proved me wrong. I feel frustrated this was just poorly conceived and rushed to an hour and forty minute \"film\" that opted for shoving plot points and ideas and the anime without being neither compelling or realizing being a TV should could, gasp, develop these characters much better and MAYBE sincerely worked. Just go watch the anime like I will if you want to see this incredibly well developed concept well realized. Adam Wingard...i'm not mad, I'm incredibly disappointed.",

There are several personality traits in the original work that didn't make it into this western adaption and made almost every chatacter feel as if you were watching a high school drama instead of an adult crime movie. Just because the movie itself tried to show many adult themed scenes, it just felt like a self glorified snuff film.",

            "content": "I'd like to start off by saying that I too, am a fan of the anime and manga series. The movie was okay, considering it was an American adaption of the series, and it was only an hour and forty minutes. However, there's no excuse to the major flaws present in the film that really irked me as a watcher, but I'll start with the good aspects, whilst trying not to compare it too much to the anime. \n\nGood Aspects:\n\nCharacters \nI had no issue with Light as an american, since the object of the movie was to make an Americanized version of the anime. Therefore, it would've made more sense to have a white teenage boy playing the part. Considering that most mass school shootings are produced by white teenage boys, I felt Light match that sort of archetype. The boy who's an outcast but is very intelligent. He gets bullied, and instead of wielding a gun to shoot up the perpetrators, he takes vengeance with the notebook. Fitting in my opinion and it's all sound when written. \nL's character was also interesting as well, and the actor did an amazing job playing his part. The sense of justice played a huge part in the film, especially since in America we value justice to a certain extent, so I believe the actor adapted this aspect very well. Ryuk however, was my favorite character portrayal. They did a great job of casting with Ryuk's character, even though he was sparing in the scenes, but even in the short glimpses he appeared, he stood out wonderfully and was unforgiving comparing to the anime. \n\nBad Aspects:\n\nCharacters\nAlthough Light was a good reflection of a implosive teen close to shooting up a school, he didn't come off as intelligent. On paper, this had a lot of potential because in the anime series, that was the basis of the plot. Two intelligent people duking it out to see if societal justice will prevail over divine vigilantism. However, because the movie incorporated a teen romance with Mia, it watered down the idea of him being smart, manipulative, and very calculating. Most of his decisions were based on impulse, and Mia basically manipulating him, which portrayed him as not very bright. His intelligence didn't truly show until close to the end of the movie, which could quickly confuse the audience if you, A) Never watched or read the series, B) Didn't pay close attention to the movie, or C), The movie was too short to eloquently highlight Light's intelligence. Light's intelligence and ability to think 10 steps of ahead of him was the reason why the series were so captivating. How could they miss the mark on this important aspect? Out of all the good aspects this series has given, I would think this one could've been spot on. \nL's persona within the series was that he's antisocial, awkward, and sometimes comically creepy yet highly intelligent as well. You see more of his intelligence in the scenes than even Light's through this adaption. L's intelligence is confusing though, because he claims his findings through his \"deductions\", but it's basically him just luckily guessing without any physical proof. He's also too emotional, when in the series he was more logical than emotional. Despite these issues I've had, I didn't think his character was portrayed as terribly as Light's was. \nMia is just a completely other character who possessed many of the qualities Light should've portrayed. She's supposed to be Misa, but there's no similarities of that character whatsoever. Plus, the movie doesn't introduce the idea that she too has a death note with a shinigami. The movie completely negates this idea, which is a very important aspect of the series, because Light basically used that to his advantage, thus is the reason why Misa was a romantic interest. In the movie, she was basically a female version of Light in the anime series. The idea of Mia having the death note and a shinigami, was something I was really looking forward to. I felt like if the movie was going to focus on a romance, it should have been in this aspect. It could've been the main focus of the movie, and it definitely would have reflected the anime much better. Why they decided to not include this? I have no idea. \n\nPlot\n\nGiven the time, the plot points were rushed. Given the hype of this film, I thought it was going to be a series, thus why the movie was an hour and forty minutes. But that wasn't the case, the movie was too short to hammer out the important details, and the transitions from Light testing the notebook, to murdering criminals, into wanting to be God of a new world was short. There was no encouragement for character development. The film also leaves out the idea of Light and L playing cat and mouse, there was literally no relationship there. In the movie, L just knew Light was the perpetrator and then worked against him. Had the movie been 2 hours and 30 minutes, that would've been enough time to highlight that sort of relationship, which is again, another great aspect of the series they've neglected to included. \n\nAll in all, I gave it a two because it wasn't good but it wasn't terrible. There was some good qualities to the movie, but if you're a fan of the series, you'll most likely be left with disappointment. I understand that this movie is an adaption, but that's no excuse to neglect the most important points of the series.",

            "content": "Death Note is one of the better movies based on a manga series, but it's still not very good. As someone who has never seen the anime, I watched the film hoping it would be good. And even though I haven't seen the anime, I was already familiar with the series and the concept long before a Hollywood movie adaptation was greenlit. There are certainly parts of the movie that worked, but I assume the parts that I liked have been done better in the anime.\n\nI enjoyed the cat and mouse game between Light and L. It made me understand why it was such a popular and beloved anime because it was so engrossing. The performances are really good for the most part, especially Willem Dafoe as Ryuk. Although he was underused, his performance was chilling and reminiscent of his performance as Norman Osbourn/Green Goblin in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man.\n\nThe movie has a little bit of dark humour as well. There's a scene where Light Turner screams like a girl that I thought was pretty funny, though it'll probably make the fans upset. Adam Wingard was also a good choice to direct the film. He shoots his films incredibly well and I don't really blame him for the film's shortcomings, even with Blair Witch (my least favourite horror movie of 2016) as he isn't a writer.\n\nUnfortunately, the writing is where the movie falls short. The film gives me very little to care about the main character. He's whiny, angsty, and even stupid at times, and it doesn't help that the lead actor was miscast. It also gives me very little to care about his girlfriend Mia (played by Margaret Qualley) and their teen romance. Mia is manipulative, annoying, and a little bit sadistic, and their romance is as by-the-numbers as it can get.\n\nThe soundtrack was also hit-and-miss. Adam Wingard loves his 80's style, synth-based music, and he previously incorporated this style in his film The Guest. The difference is that The Guest was a homage to genre movies of the 80's, so the 80's style soundtrack works with the aesthetic of the film. The soundtrack in Death Note has an 80's vibe for the sake of having an 80's vibe, and I'm pretty sure the movie isn't set anywhere near the 80's.\n\nThere are some logical and character inconsistencies as well, but my biggest problem with the movie is the pacing. Even though I haven't seen the anime and I don't know how many episodes there were in the show, Death Note (2017) feels like a TV show condensed into a movie that's 1 hour and 40 minutes long. It's very telling because the pacing was too fast. Light goes from testing the death note by writing a few names down to killing hundreds of criminals in minutes. The movie would've worked better if the movie was longer, as it needed more time to flesh out all of its ideas. Condensing all of it down into a short film makes the movie feel overcrowded.\n\nYou really need a fresh set of eyes to get the most out of this Western adaptation. If you're already a fan of the anime, chances are most of you will hate it. I can't tell you how good Death Note is as an adaptation, but as a standalone film, it's not terrible. It's not Dragonball: Evolution or The Last Airbender bad. Yes, I think The Last Airbender counts. It's not even Speed Racer bad. It's more like Ghost in the Shell bad, as in it's really not that bad. The source material is more adaptable, and a Western movie adaptation isn't a terrible idea. The terrible idea is dumbing down the source material into a YA film and making odd changes to the source material.",

            "content": "Although it didnt stick to the manga we have to be honest it is a more modern realistic sight on what a teenage high school kid these days with that background would probably react to obtaining the Death Note. In my opinion his reaction to obtaining it was one of two simple choices. 1, see that you can bring justice to those who deserve it while others that have the power don't, or 2, Do the right thing and don't let it provoke you and continue moving on with your life because it is crazy to think killing the bad guys justifies you as a good guy. We can clearly see why Light chose to pass judgement himself. His mom gets murdered and the man walks. Seeing his dad, a cop, not do anything forced him to have a grudge at life's cruel unfairness and if he were able to take matters in his owm hands he most certainly would. Enter the Death Note (or more\"fall from the sky\"). Light gets the power to pass judgement, Light becomes the hero people like him always prayed there would be.Done deal. The movie did have it's corny moments and loopholes but ultimately had a good story and interesting approach that i most certainly enjoyed. Hope there's a second one coming and would love to see more of that genius mind Light had those last 10 mins of the movie. It told me Light has understood that is not a matter of killing bad guys anymore, but actually start thinking 10 steps ahead when someone like L is around. His girlfriend helped him have a better more alert persepective of how to think ahead when she took care of those agents. This gave him experience and would show he has much more to think about in his plans. The end did show L find the page and it did show Light frighten when Ryuk said \"humans are very interesting\" but it stopped there. I'm convinced this will make it to a sequel, apart from many negative comments and ratings, this was a good start for what could be a good a series that'll progress with time molding Light into the genius we know he can be.",

Honestly is Netflix really aware that there are other genres out there other than YA highschool romance? I have not watched the anime, but of what I've heard it's one of the most celebrated animes there is, all dependent in the Japanese lore. The movie is an american take on the story, completely ignoring the lore it's based on which only manages to stay on the surface of the importance of the story.

It's like some teenager wrote a fanfic of themselves as Light but after only watching 3 episodes of the series. 100 minutes is not a lot of time for character development, and while rushing through establishing characters and important plot points, they lost the true essence of the series.\n\nLight's story isn't an exaction of revenge, it isn't a love story, it isn't running from the police; rather, it's a battle of wits between 2 highly intelligent adversaries who are both trying to unmask and kill the other. It's a duel. In the series, Light and L are convinced that something as contrived as the winner of their tennis match will determine whether or not Light must be Kira. In the Netflix movie, there is no doubt: Light is Kira because his dad wasn't killed. In the series, Light and L work closely together even chained together in the equivalent of 2 boxers standing toe-to-toe with neither backing down. In the Netflix movie, L chases Light through the city with a gun.\n\nMore than anything the biggest problem is the characters loss of personality. L retains his solitude and detective skills but loses his social awkwardness, cleverness, calm, and likability. Light's intelligence is merely implied but for a glimpse of strategy in the end. Light is reluctant to kill innocents after only choosing to continue using the note's power for the sake of philanthropy. Instead, these two are just cop and robber with Mia's character actually being closer to the anime's Light.\n\nNot even WIllem Dafoe's voice can redeem this movie. Had I not seen the series before watching this, I think I still would have been put off by the annoying romance, all 3 of the main characters, and sadly even Ryuk.

It is clearly a challenge to take an old and foreign story and remake it for a domestic and modern audience, and I was impressed at how well Netflix pulled this off.\n\nOf course it is unfair for fans to scrutinise how different this film is to the actual source material, yet the film by itself still has some evident problems which could have easily been rectified. \n\nHowever, I shall begin with what this film does right. For the most part the film did an excellent job creating something new out of an already familiar story. The best being how the deaths are carried out. Instead of having every victim simply die of a heart attack like in the manga/anime/Japanese film(s), they instead take a \"Final Destination\" spin which makes the deaths far more interesting and horrifying. This is not only more visually familiar/pleasing to North American audiences, but also makes Light as well as the viewer(s) to take the matter of using the Death Note more serious and question whether it is even right to use it. \n\nThe second best thing this film did was how they portrayed Ryuk. I absolutely loved how they portrayed him as a powerful and fearsome demon instead of just some pacifist, gothic ghost whose only real use it to tie up loose ends in regards to the Death Note and its origins/rules. Ryuk is shown to have incredible, supernatural abilities which he uses to directly affect the deaths of the Death Note's victims. I also like how he is portrayed as a being who does whatever he wishes and even ventures out on his own once in awhile. By the way, William Dafoe was the perfect casting choice for this character!\n\nThe third best thing this film did was Light's character development. It was absolutely rushed in the beginning as he discovers the Death Note in less than two minutes of screen-time without a single bit of dialogue from anyone. However, what the film does right is how it takes the \"Whiplash\" approach to Light's character development; having Light start as a rather \"normal\" individual at first who has some gifts, yet as he delves more and more into the Death Note (no thanks to a brooding mentor) he becomes more sinister, cold, and calculating like the Light in the manga/anime. In my opinion this is far better than having a Mary Sue Light who becomes an anti-hero right off the bat. \n\nOne final good note to give this film is its casting choices. They were all absolutely perfect and I couldn't have asked for anything better! Especially William Dafoe as Ryuk!\n\nThe greatest sin this film has, however, the one major problem this film has which ruins it as a good standalone, is that it did not properly condense a manga/TV series into a singe film. \n\nThere is so much content in this film which is crammed in, rushed and filled with loose ends and plot holes that it makes the film seem like some \"fan-fiction\" or a highlight reel of an entire season. It relies on fans of the Death Note series to fill in too many of the blanks, yet when its an adaption with distinct differences from the source it makes it difficult for even Death Note fans to properly follow along.\n\nI understand that Netflix did not want to take the gamble of making an entire television series out of what was a crapshoot concept, yet if they truly wanted to make this film an absolute success they truly should have made it as a fully standalone film. \n\nIn conclusion this film is a surprisingly good North American adaption of the famous manga/anime series, yet ultimately falls short as it forces too many unfinished and unnecessary subplots.",

In the original, Mia was not too bright and extremely annoying in a way that you actually like her because she is so annoying. In this retelling Mia sends a powerful message that American females are using their males for sex and to satisfy personal ambitions. \n\nIt's one thing to adapt a cult-favorite story from one culture (Japanese) to another (American), but this is no adaptation. This is a full bas---dization.\n\nIf this movie appeals to you, then I strongly encourage you to watch the anime series before you watch this movie.

            "content": "This movie isn't great, and nor would I recommend watching it. However, one must bear in mind that Death Note is 37 episodes long, and very hard to successfully sum up in a mere couple of hours.\n \nFurthermore, one of the main goals of the movie was to grow the fanbase, and to achieve this, the director effectively felt like they had to Americanise the story completely, as it could be difficult for non-anime-watchers to connect with.\n\nHowever, there are some aspects that the movie has no excuses for. Light Yagami (Anime) is a cool, calculating and manipulative young man who is bent solely on creating his own perfect world. At some points, it is clear that he is even prepared to kill his own father. Light Turner (Movie) is rash, easily manipulated himself, and shows little evidence of the intelligence he is supposed to have.\n\nMoving onto L. In the anime, L's methods are smart and cunning, whereas in the movie his deductions can't really be justified, he practically GUESSES that Light is Kira. In terms of L's personality, he is led far more by his emotions than his logic, which is completely the opposite of the anime, and this just doesn't work.\n\nNow onto Misa. I feel a lot like Misa, or \"Mia\" and Light switch personalities for the movie. Mia is far more manipulative than Light, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing except for the fact that it further proves Light Turner's lack of judgement and intelligence. She goes so far *Spoiler* as to threaten Light, which would never happen in the anime.\n\nThe plot in general is decent, but too fast-paced and leaves too many gaps in the story, though as I already stressed earlier, this is extremely tough to do. It does provide a few new and good substitutes for some parts of the original Death Note, which twists the story a bit. Although some fans of the series may say that some are too drastic, I believe that they work quite well (being a hardcore fan of the series myself.)\n\nIn conclusion, this adaption is far from perfect. However, it is very hard to create an adaption of an anime, which has been demonstrated several times in recent years. In terms of general enjoyment: If you stop thinking too much about the movie and stop comparing it to the original, then it's a half-decent watch.",

The whole moral question that makes the Death Note concept interesting is what happens when someone who is idealistic and  virtuous and has no reason to hate society is given great power and sets out to use it to make the world a better place.  This film just gives us another messed up teenager story.  Light isn't virtuous and he isn't particularly interesting either.\n\nIn addition, while Misa Amane was shallow and not very bright in the Japanese versions, she acted out of postiive emotions such as gratitude and love - again raising the moral questions that made Death Note interesting.  In this version she is just a vicious thrill-seeker.  She is not a powerful female, she is just boring.\n\nL is also a failure.  He has none of the remarkable control and calculated intelligence that characterized L in the original.  He's been turned into a rage-filled teenager instead of the the complex savant he should be.\n\nI've watched all the versions of Death Note and the read the manga, and this version is the worst I've encountered.  \n\nIt's too bad, because an American Death Note could have been interesting.  It could have explored ideas about morality and justice set in a world that is less rule-oriented than Japan.  It could have had complex, interesting characters to go along with the pretty special effects and atmospheric cinematography.  \n\nUnfortunately it just isn't worth the time to watch.  If you want a live-action version of Death Note, pick Death Note and Death Note the Last Name.  Or watch the anime or read the manga.  Even the recent Japanese live-action sequels the Death Note films with give you a more enjoyable and better experience than this one.",

So why try to do that? Instead just make it work for the intended format and audience. With that goal, and viewing this independently of the source material, i feel it succeeded in creating material that I consider entertaining. The ending really does bate for a sequel, and I hope they get the numbers to green light one. If you're a hardcore fan boy, I wouldn't recommend you watch this, it will only give you a nose bleed.

This character does not resemble the original much more than superficial similarities.  His personality and motivation are his own.  As a fan of the original I would have enjoyed this version a bit more if it had been Lucas Turner or whatever.\n\n- The Death Note is overpowered and has new rules in it that force the narrative on a rapid pace compared to the manga.  I understand they are there to help pace out a 90 min film but the page burning rule is a deus ex machina that just serves bad writing.  Once your name is in the Book, you are done.\n\n- I liked Defoe as Ryuk, great voice acting and a menacing character but he has much more initiative in this than the manga.  As opposed to a spectator he is instead pushing the narrative on as fast as he can.  Again, this is likely to serve the purpose of adding tension and urgency to the story so it fits a movie.\n\n- casting could have been better, would have liked an Asian lead",

Honestly though, I feel like a lot of Death Note fans will be disappointed in this, but this has a huge Final Destination feel to it.

            "content": "A couple of years ago, I had reached the end of my Attack on Titan binge watch and as any fan knows, the series comes to an abrupt unfinished ending, leaving us still awaiting the second season. So I turn to my anime guru looking for a desperate replacement fix as I go into withdrawal, and he tells me about Death Note. He described as not being an action anime, but instead an intellectual cat and mouse series, an intriguing battle of wits between two amazing characters. I wasn't overly sold about the idea of Death Note but once I had seen the first episode, I was hooked, eagerly await to see each outcome. \n\nThe idea and myth behind Death Note is genius and brilliant, being very original and whilst having so many rules and restrictions it actually ensures endless possibilities, loop holes and unpredictable challenges. In short, a high school kid gains possession of a Death Note, a note book from another realm. If a name of a person is written in the book, that person will shortly die after which spurs multiple, suspicions deaths and earns the attention of the authorities ensuing a battle of wits between the boy, Light and the lead investigator, L. \n\nThe origin manga was written by Tsugami Ohba and inked by Takeshi Obata back in 2003 and 108 chapters was converted into a 37 episode, anime series in 2006, which got global recognition, Yup, Death Note has been around for awhile, It isn't the first live action adaption but the third after two Japanese live action versions; one from last year and the first back in 2006 making it the first American adaptation of the manga series. \n\nHow can you squeeze an entire 37 episodes into under two hours? It's impossible to fully develop, appreciate and understood the relationships between Light, L and Ryuk. It's no where near as intelligent to it's original source, with massive plot changes and subtractions which may insult many of the fans. There's was so much missed out, but of course, they're trying to rework the story and script into a film with only a runtime of 101minutes. \n\nDafoe does make a good Ryuk apple-addict shinigami, a death god, though he only provided the voice and the physical Ryuk is played by Jason Liles. Lakeith was close with portraying the genius Interpol agent, L, taking much from the original anime character like his awkward postures and mannerisms, but it still isn't him.and while Wolff isn't a complete failure as Light, the trouble is the character. Light Turner is morally different from the original Light, and instead they merge his ruthlessness into another butchered character and love interest, Mia (Qualley). \n\nWingard does well to create a dark and gloomy atmosphere throughout, which is probably his horror experience seeping into the film, being famed for director V/H/S and 2016's Blair Witch. Though this isn't a horror and like the anime, you get use to the grotesque Ryuk hanging around and actually welcome his company. The only really horror element is the first encounter with Ryuk and there's plenty of gore. It's the right move, as it's all about the suspense, wanting to know who each of the characters are going to make their next move. Though the intensity isn't as strong as the Anime, but I wonder if that's because I'm familiar with the story already. \n\nThere's an odd choice of soundtrack of 80's classics like Berlin, Chicago and Jennifer Rush. Not being set in the 80's I wonder to what the reasoning was behind the choices. What it meant to make the film more appealing to certain audiences? Like fans of Stranger Things maybe? I love 80's music so it worked for me but sadly, I couldn't notice much of Atticus/Leopold Ross' score. \n\nIt's not a great advert for the original material and would assume viewers watching this as their first interaction with Death Note, wouldn't take much away from it thinking it's weak with not much to offer, possibly wondering what all the fuss is about. The magic of the source material, is the intelligence of the engaging chase, loaded with unpredictable twists and plot developments. This merely skims the surface making it quite the disappointment. \n\nRunning Time: 6\nThe Cast: 5\nPerformance: 7\nDirection: 7\nStory: 2 (only by comparison) \nScript: 2 (same as above) \nCreativity: 7\nSoundtrack: 5\nJob Description: 2\nThe Extra Bonus Points: -5 for not capitalising on Death Note's key ingredient.  \n\n38% 4/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

The director has some solid ideas and a sharp eye for detail, but the script just sweats with an overabundance of confusing mythology and far too little to actually maintain the attention of the audience.

I enjoyed the direction, the stylized and interesting cinematography. It felt rushed, like there were key elements missing. But the speed kept the film from getting boring, and that is possibly the biggest transgression a film can make. Judge a film on it's terms. Not because you don't like changes from the source material. Please feel free to message me on twitter if you want to discuss this. I'm in the process of watching the anime over the coming weeks. @wolfmanwalter13",

So if you're a fan of either then don't even watch this, watch the Japanese Live Action ones instead. They stay true to the source material unlike this. Besides the fact that they change the setting, and whitewash with their awful cast... They erase the cultural identity in everyway possible. Change the characters to the point that they aren't even them it's ridiculous. They reverse Light, and Misa's personalitys basicly or devide Light's traits into both of them. First if all Light would never kill a bully for picking on someone WTF, and Ryuk wouldn't edge him on to do so. Deal breaker right off the bat, I mean come on. When Misa touches the notebook, why doesn't see Ryuk. They change things from no reason, why water it down just because. L is out of character as well, picking up a gun at one point, acting irrational, and uncollected. He'd never act that way, or even think about using a fire arm. Wouldn't matter what happened. Ryuk is the only character that's anything like his Manga/Anime counterpart, and he has barely any screen time. Wingard says he's a fan, yet has no respect for the source material. They way they end it is not satisfying in any way, it just feel like a middle finger to everyone watching, much like the whole thing. This movie isn't for fans of the original material, it's for people that wanna see a final destination type movie(something someone said defending the movie on YouTube before it was even released). Death Note should have been made into a series by someone that wasn't going to ignore the source material, and erase it's Japanese culture. Don't watch this movie, so they don't make a sequel. Then maybe someone will adapt it the right way, and make it into a series, like it should have been. I mean really, why wouldn't they make it a Netflix Series. Now I'm just getting angry again, just go read the Manga if you haven't. Watch the anime, the four Japanese Live Action movies. Oh, and there's a Japanese series from 2015 with 11 episodes, and they're a hour long. It's great Near, and Mellow are even in it after awhile. Just not this hackjob attempt.",

The incredible piano score from the show was also somehow transformed into a completely different and prosaic soundtrack which made the movie even more upsetting. Furthermore, the identity of \"L\" was revealed immediately, which ruins his way of mystery and secrecy that the show focused on. Lastly, the way the characters were developed made me feel nothing for them and made me wish I could have written their characters in the death note. Do not waste your time with this movie. \n\nP.S.

DETENTION. let me say it again for the people in the back: D E T E N T I O N. prestigious, perfect light yagami gets detention. in what world would this motherfucker get detention? light is known to be a perfect student, a role model of sorts, and he would never, ever get detention. in fact, he'd never do anyone's homework for them, and even if he did, he'd be smart enough to not get caught.\n\nfrom the beginning, you're already not on light's side. and that's bad, because you're supposed to feel some sense of sympathy for him at first. that's why he's my favorite. he was a good kid, but when he got the death note it corrupted him so far that he turned evil. awful. he's a piece of shit, and that's why i love him. the movie ruined that.\n\nthe notebook does not \"happen\" to fall into light's possession. as we all know, ryuk drops it for the purpose of playing a little game with a human, but he doesn't care which human it drops to. in the movie, it's obviously set up so that light is the one who gets the death note. i mean, holy fuck, it dropped directly to him. directly next to him. RIGHT AT HIM. it dropped to him as though the book was MEANT to find him, even though we hear from ryuk himself in the anime that it wasn't meant to drop to anyone in particular (though light thinks it was supposed to).\n\nso the movie progresses. quick mention to the opening scenes though, misa is looking at light and he looks back at her longingly. that's right, kids, they have a mutual crush. MUTUAL. M U T U A L. that's bullshit. light gave 0 fucks about misa, he just wanted to use her for her shinigami eyes (which she doesn't have, by the way. nor does she have rem. or a death note. or anything. she's just...THERE.)\n\nlight meets ryuk in detention and freaks the fuck out. in the anime, he screams once, gets kind of jittery, and eventually becomes completely calm around ryuk. but in the movie? all he does is scream and shout and freak the fuck out the first time he sees ryuk. it's like the level-headed version of light has been completely consumed by this over-emotional, irrational jackoff. and it's ridiculous.\n\nso blah blah blah, he kills his first victim. which isn't a man about to rape a woman like it is in the anime, mind you. it's a bully. a fucking bully. something as simple as a BULLY. yeah, bullies suck, and i was bullied for all of elementary, middle, and some of high school, but bullies aren't top criminals. they don't deserve to die. that also makes me think of the needless gore the movie shows off, fyi. the first guy gets decapitated by a ladder and his head flies off of his body and splats on the ground, spreading blood and shit everywhere. it's disgusting, and not something the death note movie does. they don't utilize gore for entertainment; they give you real entertainment.\n\nthe movie, from here, gets moving pretty quick. misa and light become lovers because of course, in every teen fucking movie nowadays, there needs to be a love story - despite the fact that all anime watchers know that light could give less of a shit about misa. if he were done using her, he would probably have killed her himself. but instead, we get shown a \"beautiful\" story of blossoming love between them, and let me tell you, it's fucking disgusting. no one watches death note for romance, and if they do, they're basically shit fuck outta luck, because that's not what death note is about.\n\nso yeah, they go crazy killing criminals and shit, and in comes L. ah yes, the man, the myth, the legend, L. he does his detective shit or whatever (+1 because watari was actually in the movie, and basically DID do everything for L because he couldn't do it for himself). he's on light's case immediately, which we of course know doesn't happen in the anime. because for all of L's intelligence, light hardly leaves a trail that leads back to himself, so it's hard to figure out if he's the one killing everyone or not. but nope. this shitty, dumb fucking light, is leaving this big ass trail leading back to him, and L has no problem sniffing him out.\n\nmisa, by this point, is basically controlling everything. oh yes, MISA. dumb, prissy, love-struck misa. misa who is in the anime to be nothing but light's pawn (though, she is shown to be very intelligent at first - until light makes his way into the picture). she's the smart one. she's the one who wants to start killing cops. SHE'S the one who convinces light to kill certain people. misa, basically, runs the show. and we all know in the anime, that doesn't happen. that would NEVER happen, because misa was under light's spell, and she would have followed him to the ends of the earth. in the movie? role reversal.\n\nso yeah whatever, they're doing their thing and L's doing his. the movie gets a +1 because a lot of L's characteristics were actually done incredibly. he was always barefoot; he was an insomniac; he was the world's smartest detective; he (most of the time) sat in his weird crouched position; all we saw him eat was candy; he did (in a scene or two) have on his usual jeans and white shirt; among other things. so L was actually PRETTY DARN GOOD! however, they kind of destroyed this by making him kind of an over-emotional wreck who did things irrationally, because of FEEEEEELINGS, which we all know is not something L would've done. it would have effected his detective skills, to get emotional the way he does in the movie.\n\noh, and he also wears this weird turtleneck thing to cover his face? because he's in public really often? which makes no sense because we know L is pretty anti-social and prefers to be indoors?\n\nso yeah the movie does its stuff or whatev, and L finally figures that light is kira but light's dad is like \"NAH\". i liked that he was very protective of light. light's dad was actually REALLY good. the sad part was that light's sister and mom weren't around. he had no sister and his mom was dead, like? why you gotta make him the most stereotypical guy to go insane?\n\nL confronts light openly in a stupid cafe which we know he wouldn't do, and then light admits to being kira but he DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE DEATH NOTE AND DOESN'T KILL L AND L DOESN'T DO SHIT ABOUT IT, another thing neither of them would ever, ever do, ever ever in the history of EVER. and it's so fucking ridiculous i almost laughed.\n\nlight and misa go to this dance. misa tries to get the death note for herself, obviously something the real misa wouldn't have done because she did anything light said to do. meanwhile, watari is trying to find L's real name at the orphanage (-10000 because it's all beaten down and near and mello are nowhere to be found, oh and minus another 100000000000 because matsuda wasn't in the movie and i literally love him)? and he dies?? which i'm still angry about, fyi.\n\nso light and misa meet at this damn ferris wheel and she writes in the death note that he's gonna die if he doesn't give her the death note by 12 am, but he dupes her and writes that SHE should die instead and that the page is going to magically burn in a magical fire and he's going to fall off of the ferris wheel and live while she falls off and dies. misa's death was actually pretty cool, cinematic wise, because she falls into this cart of flowers and they kind of fly up all around her? it was actually really, really cool, even though it doesn't actually happen in the anime.\n\nlight ends up in a coma and later when he wakes up reveals that he made a pedophile do his bidding while he was out to snuff the trail leading to him (too fucking late) and when he's up and shit he tells his dad he was always kira. obviously not legit but alright movie, it's your life do what you want. so this is pretty much the end now, but it actually ends with L finding the piece of the death note with watari's name on it and it ends abruptly with an implication that L was going to write light's name down to kill him, which we all know ain't real.\n\nbut the biggest letdown of the movie? light never took a potato chip...and ate it. :'(?",

I was really looking forward to a westernised version of one of the best animes ever. \n\nThe only good part was Ryuk, very well voice acted and fairly close to the Ryuk of the Anime. However Light and L were both so badly written it's shocking. \n\nIn the anime Light starts off with a superiority complex, he's the best at everything he does, is good looking, popular, highly intelligent and sporty. It's his innate sense of justice that causes him to do the things he does. The only part of  that which comes across in the movie is his intelligence, he otherwise acts very much like a moody loaner. It's almost as if the writer's thoughts on his motivation is that he has to be damaged in some way, with revenge (not justice) being his primary motivation. The moodiness can be forgiven if we take the movie on its own and put it down to his mother being killed. He also shouldn't be falling in love, over time Light in the anime becomes more and more sociopathic and uses the people around him towards his own ends, not caring about how his manipulations affect them. The movie comes across as a teen romance with none of the excellent psychological manipulation that Light is know for.\n\nL is also poorly written in comparison to the anime. L is always cool, calm and collected in the anime. He's very badly damaged which is was causes his eccentricities and comes across as more of a sociopath than Light. In the movie he's far too emotional and tried to take matters into his own hands when he basically goes mad with the desire for revenge.\n\nThere's a fair amount more wrong with this movie, but I could forgive everything that I've already mentioned IF they had actually managed to work in the psychological manipulation that both Light and L engage in. It wouldn't even have to follow the same exact story. It would just have to actually be good. The lame attempts at manipulation using the rules (of which there are far too many and are easily circumvented) of the notebook are all forgettable with the possible exception of the final scene on the ferris wheel. The final scene with Lights entry into the Death Note also ends up working to very neatly wrap everything up in a little bow and feels like it was just too easy.\n\nI hope Netflix try again, and this time preferably make it a series, and not a simple teenage romance with a little bit of horror. It should be full of twists and be totally unpredictable because of the cleverness of the characters.\n\nThis is the first Netflix made entertainment I haven't liked, and sfor an anime series I loved. I'm absolutely gutted that I have to give it such a low score.",

It's like someone tried to make a supernatural detective drama with acting about on par with The Room. The plot is scattered and at times intangible, the characters have no depth and do nothing to draw the viewer's interest or sympathy. There is no real development of relationships between characters, which results in you feeling nothing over the many deaths throughout the film. Heavy handed visual effects taint even the tamest of scenes, making the actual viewing process a chore. The deaths each feel like something out of a Final Destination movie, and instead of dealing out suspense, the film just forcefeeds the viewer gore for the sake of gore. Even Willem Dafoe's performance, which I wholeheartedly hoped would be the saving grace of this film, was unable to help my final verdict, as it was so dampered by the material he had to work with and the editing surrounding him, not to mention the poor quality of CGI. The soundtrack is honestly also garbage, not because of the music itself, but because of the placement of the tracks in the movie at horribly inappropriate times for them to be playing. I'm gonna be honest here, the entire climax scene had this \"My Heart Will Go On\" vibe because of the music. This movie was doomed for failure the moment it was announced, for the same reasons as The Last Airbender, and Dragonball Evolution. The stories these movies are based on are so successful because of the format they were originally produced in. Trying to cram an entire season of a deep, complicated story, into two hours (give or take), just doesn't work, much less an entire series into the same amount of time. Maybe one of these years Hollywood will learn to let the most successful franchises be, and not try to squeeze the last few bucks out of it at the cost of its soul -- but I sincerely doubt it. Now, that being said, I still highly recommend the original anime, whether you're a fan of anime or not. I'm not a big anime guy, but I still give the Death Note anime 5 stars.",

Next time, make the full adaptation of the comic books,(only 12 well thought out rules and stick to the manga's plot), and have Defoe play Riuk again. As for L, this one jumped right into \"here's my face\" mode and lost the qwurky edge the character is known for. Not sure how much this one cost to make, but please remake it correctly, keep the Riuk costume, it definitely worked and I'm sure it was expensive.

They always have to jack it up!\n\nAnyway...I'm not a big Death Note fan, but I know enough about it that I understand the gist of the whole thing--and I know how the main character, Light Yagami, is.\n\nThis movie's version of Light is NOT the Light you love to hate. He's just a bratty, angsty teen in this adaptation. No longer is he the egocentric, cold-hearted, eccentric genius that he is in the Japanese version--no longer is Light calm and calculated in his decision. No longer is Light apathetic about the people he kills with the Death Note, all for the sake of preserving his own twisted sense of justice.\n\nThe Light in this Netflix film is a fucking SAP! He feels guilt over certain kills, he loves his girlfriend, he's only book-smart and not maliciously ruthless in his intelligence. He's just....a kid...who wants revenge. Wow, big deal!\n\nI don't like Light Yagami--he's a narcissistic prick. But that's what makes Death Note really interesting: The lead character is someone you can't stand but are intrigued by anyway because he's so clever and manipulative. The Netflix movie ruins this image entirely!\n\nAnd Mia is no Misa. Mia is a bratty teen girl with some emotional issues. She's not the adorably naive girl that you can't help but pity in the Japanese story. Misa loved Light in the manga/anime but he didn't love her--he just used her, like he did a lot of people. The Netflix movie turns their relationship into a sappy teen romance with a Death God thrown in the mix to make it \"interesting.\"\n\nNO. JUST. NO.\n\nI will say, I did like the actor playing \"L.\" He did a good job with the role, even if it wasn't exactly the \"L\" we know and love. But the character was much better represented in the Netflix film than Light and Mia/Misa. I also liked Willem Dafoe as the voice of the Death God, Ryuk. Very awesome touch, but I sure hope he got paid well for this because he is too good for it.\n\nSeriously, just read the manga and/or watch the anime, or maybe watch the Japanese live-action films. Granted, this movie wasn't a complete disaster, but it certainly isn't going to become a modern legend like the manga and anime.",

In the death note , Ryuk says to Light that he parts with NO ONE , he's neutral from the start and he's only there beacause is bored in the death world and he need new distration, that's the reason of his presence in the human world.

I am coming from a fresh perspective, which has never seen or read the original Japanese source material. I am not sure how accurate this film is or how different. I will say I feel like the supernatural tone with the creepy mysterious death god worked well on screen. Death Note is not terrible or great. It is entertaining for what it is and the theme of the movie tried covering some relatable issues with today's world problems. The performances were decent and the visual effects were mediocre. \n\nThe films plot gets right to the point. It begins with Light Turner (Nat Wolff) in high school, which is dealing in selling copies of exams answers to students. A mysterious notebook falls to the ground right next to him called \"Death Note.\" He soon enough gets caught in the middle of protecting another student from being bullied and gets knocked out himself. Soon enough in detention, a death god Ryuk (voiced by Willem Dafoe) appears and informs Light about the rules of the notebook. Write a name down, how they should get killed, and remember the face when writing the name. Light soon tries it out in trying to get rid of a bully, and then searches for criminals that are escaping the justice system, or on live news feed holding hostages. Light's girlfriend Mia (Margaret Qualley) tries to help with them justifying on who should be executed using this death god. Light's father James (Shea Whigham) is on this trail of mysterious deaths which is trying to stop the body counts from going up. Which creates a divide with the civilians as they believe its Kira known for mysterious god taking out the criminals and the people support the events for doing good to society. While James and an obsessed compulsive detective L (Lakeith Stanfield) is on the trail of Kira, and suspects that it could be someone close that is using the death god. \n\nI liked how the plot relates to real world situations such as using the death god to bring down terrorists, criminals, etc. Then, it all has repercussions with how is the society going to react to the crime rate going down. How are the law enforcements going to react that they have possibly a good guy eliminating all the bad people out there? Will they side with the kira? Or will they retaliate to stop it? Since the issue of who decides on who should die or live? It is the questions that Light Turner struggles with, when he wants to do good in the world. But the limits will only get him so far, before his actions will have consequences. \n\nWillem Dafoe as the death god is menacing. It is scary looking with his punk rock looking outfit and look. It is something that will give you chills when you see the shadows in the dark. Nat Wolff and Margaret Qualley were both decent as Light and Mia. \n\nThe visual effects were decent. The look on the death god was great. There is some climatic sequence shot on the ferris wheel that looked cheaply made. \n\nMy issues with the film which I could not stand was Lakeith Stanfield performance. His character is by far the most annoying person you will ever see. A hardcore detective that eats lots of candy to keep his insulin up and has his face covered most of the time and acts like a teenage idiot for an adult by hopping on table's chairs. Lakeith performance still acted like he was the hypnotized person in the Get Out movie. And his performance in Death Note was no different. \n\nAlso, the direction with the tone felt like it had no idea what it wanted to be if it was teen supernatural comedy or full on thriller. Especially, when characters are falling to their deaths and some love sappy song ends up playing in the scene. \n\nOverall, Death Note is a fair film. Nat Wolff and Margaret Qualley were decent. Willem Dafoe was great and menacing. The plot and concept had a nice exploration with the themes. But Lakeith Stanfield was irritating and annoying every time he was on screen. And the direction was becoming incoherent on what kind of tone it wanted to be. \n\nI rate the film 3 out of 5 stars.",

The only anime I've ever really recalled watching for any length of time was Shin Chan and that was mostly because its sense of humor was very irreverent.  And I think that's the only type of anime I'd enjoy, stuff like Space Dandy that's comedy and absurd.  I don't think I'd get into the super serious and melodramatic animes.  Maybe I would, but that's just me.  As far as anime films go, Hayao Miyazaki is the fucking man and I've watched all but 3 of his films.  I like Studio Ghibli stuff and I've watched a few other non-Ghibli animated films, but not as many as I probably should have.  I wanted to see Letters to Momo, which was on Amazon Prime for quite a bit, but I just never got a round to it.  That's neither here nor there.  As far as Death Note is concerned, I was certainly familiar with the manga, the anime and, to a lesser extent, the two Japanese films.  I think it's one of those series that, even if you're not into anime and that style, you'd know of even if your knowledge of geek culture was minimal.  Having said that, I didn't think this film was good.  I'm not gonna sit here and lie to you.  I find the concept to be absolutely great, however, and I think that it would have made for a better movie under better circumstances.  I like Adam Wingard.  I was a big fan of The Guest, You're Next and the first two VHS movies.  It's clear that this guy has talent as a filmmaker and you get to see that on display here, from a technical aspect at least.  But I'll be damned if I didn't find this movie to be a complete and goddamned mess as it relates to the narrative.  Part of me wonders how much of the negative reaction is actually legitimate and how much of it is fanboys that are upset their favorite manga/anime series wasn't made exactly how they would have wanted it.  I'm sure there's a lot of the latter.  Because, as I mentioned, while the movie isn't good, it's certainly perfectly fine to watch.  I'll say this right now, if this movie was 100 minutes of Light writing names in the Death Note and their deaths playing in as gory a fashion as is possible, this movie would have been great.  You can even introduce the whole morality angle with Light questioning whether he's doing the right thing or not as his girlfriend will do whatever she must to protect herself...and Light.  And you certainly get some of that.  Hell, the film might have also been better if, removing Light's girlfriend from the equation, he just had to deal with Ryuk just being a prick.  Ryuk is, quite easily, the best character in the entire film and Willem Dafoe plays him to perfection.  I just wish the character had more of a presence than he actually did.  But going back to an earlier point, as it relates to the gore.  The movie sort of fools you into thinking it's gonna be a complete gorefest by showing you some pretty damn gruesome deaths early on.  The decapitation and restaurant scenes are something to behold, for sure.  There's also this scene where this guy is run over by a SWAT truck and, again, it's pretty incredible.  And that's about it for the truly over-the-top gore.  They literally blow their wad 25 minutes into the movie and it is downhill from there in the gore department.  And, to be fair, a movie doesn't need gore to be good.  But that is true when you substitute the gore for something that's as equally effective.  And, surprise surprise, what they substitute with isn't effective.  Ok, where do I start?  Light and Mia, his girlfriend, use the Death Note to give a voice to the voiceless.  Someone who'll stand up for those that have always been stepped on in their lives.  They give this 'being' a name, Kira, and proceed to kill over 400 people who, supposedly, deserve it.  As a result of this, a cult of Kira starts to rise up.  This isn't a bad idea, except you rarely get to see any of this cult.  They just tell you that a cult has started up that supports Kira's actions.  The problem is that this whole cult thing feels completely inconsequential.  And it's just poorly-handled, honestly.  It's like Light and Mia kill a few people and now they have a cult of supporters.  It doesn't feel earned.  Moving on, the film then becomes a cat-and-mouse game with this eccentric private detective named L, whose identity and face remain hidden in order to avoid being put in the Death Note by Light.  Then the film becomes about Light (and Mia) trying to find out this guy's identity to kill him in order to stop the investigation.  And, again, this isn't a bad idea, but there's not nearly enough time to get to know both characters of Light and L to make this feel like the big showdown that they want to make it out to be.  There's also the whole thing with Mia being completely blinded by the power the Death Note brings and her manipulations of Light in order to get him to give her the book.  Did I mention that Light's father is also a cop and how that blinds him to the truth.  When I write it out like this, it doesn't sound like too much, but the flick really is overloaded with too much content and not enough time.  And not to mention the fact some of the flaws with Light and Mia being so damn open about what they do in some occasions and some downright idiocy from their part.  I'll be honest, I didn't find any of the characters to be that likable.  I suppose the whole idea is to be morally grey, but I'm certain you're supposed to invest into Light as a lead character and you want him to realize the error of his actions.  But I never reached that point.  The climax was so ineffective.  Mia and Light are on this Ferris wheel and the whole thing starts to fall apart, as a result of Mia grabbing the Death Note after Light made a plea to stop themselves from continuing this cycle.  Anyway, they're hanging off the side of the wheel, about to fall off, and I said, out loud, 'fuck it, you both die'.  I don't think that was the conclusion you were meant to come to.  Yes, Light came to the realization that what they did was wrong, but he's still not exactly likable.  Mia was insufferable, so I'm glad she died.  Another thing is that Light, even after Mia put his name in the Note, still mourns her death.  What a fucking dumbfuck.  That makes him even more unlikable to me.  This girl put his name in the Death Note in order to manipulate him into giving her the book so she could continue her murdering ways.  And he still loves her.  What a fucking A-class moron.  To me, the biggest flaw in this movie, and I already mentioned it, is the fact that there's way too much going on here for the amount of time they have.  Nothing is given time to breathe or simmer.  It's all given to you in a compact, but messy, package.  The casting is strong all around, with Dafoe stealing the show with his voice acting, so the problems aren't on them, it's just on the scripting of everything.  So, yea, I guess 2 stars feels appropriate for this.  A large part of it certainly watchable and the film is visually appealing.  Some of the techno-synth score was also really good.  But there's no denying that this should have been so much better than it actually was.  It's almost as if a television series would have been a better outlet for this story.  Funny how that works.  Either way, this is ok, but I can't recommend.  I think non-fans will enjoy it more than fans, but that's not really gonna amount to much in the long run.",

They just bought the Franchise name of \"Death Note\" and went and messed it up.\n\nThey took out everything that made Death Note unique. The philosophy behind what Justice means and how different people interpolate Justice and the conflicts of being righteous in your own point of view and how others see it.\n\nMoreover, they took out everything that made it into a smart detective story and just dumb it down to saying L is super smart and he deduce stuff but with no actually explanation on how or what or why he came to those deduction conclusions. He just does...\n\nDon't even get me started on Light and how ridiculous he was portrayed. Light (in the original material) is supposed to be super smart and his sense of justice is super strong that you might call it being an extremist. but of-course, the movie dumb it down and portrayed him as being an edge-lord teenager who think he is god cause he got a powerful tool which is the Death Note. And he tries to get some action from a crush he has in High School by immediately showing her the Death Note just cause he is a thirsty teenager... and it works... sigh... The Light (in the original material) is supposed to be manipulative and uses Mia (who has a crush on him and reversed in the movie) to his advantage, he abuses her to get what he wants and goes to the extreme of breaking her for his justice. Also he is supposed to be a force to not be messed up with even without his Death Note because of how smart he is. Furthermore, Light in this movie just ignore the rules of the book and doesn't even read or understand them unlike how in the original material the rules were very important and Light used them for his advantage.\n\nLastly, Ryuk... I got to admit, the CGI was really good and i did enjoy Willem Dafoe portraying him, it fits him really good. However, we cant ignore that they simply did not explain why Ryuk was doing what he was doing and he was just \"bored\" with no hidden agenda. Just because he was a death god...\n\nI personally was NOT a big fan of Death Note anime nor manga and thought it was an okay entry-level anime/manga to this genre. But still, this Netflix movie made the same mistakes Dragonball Evolution did.\n\nI would recommend watching the original live-action Death Note Japanese movies because they are much more true to the story and is more enjoyable than what Netflix did.\n\n1 Star for Ryuk CGI only...",

            "content": "Death Note, directed by Adam Wingard ('Blair Witch', 'The Guest') and released on Netflix is an American live-action adaptation of the incredibly popular Anime series from the year 2006. Death Note just happens to be the only Anime series i have watched in full so i was looking forward to seeing how the story would be adapted to fit a shorter film-length format. And for the most part i enjoyed what i saw, although it could have still been better. One of the issues with a lot of adaptations is that when they stray away from the source material they don't have the same impact as the original, now where that could apply here too i don't think the issues with Death Note lie with the changes in plot. The performances across the board were very strong and i found myself engaged in the lives of the main characters. Visually the film has a beautiful sense of style thanks to Wingard and is accompanied by a chilling score that sucks you into the Death Note world. It's dark, fast paced, and somewhat psychologically thrilling but still doesn't reach the greatness that is the Anime. \n\nNat Wolff plays the role of Light Turner and like many of the other performances i thought he was great. There are obviously character trait changes from the anime but i still feel like their representations here aren't too far off. I found Wolff's performance as Light for the most part very engaging to follow, i could get behind or disagree with the character very easily and he brings forward that ambiguity between good and evil that is a theme in the Anime and a strong theme throughout this entire film. Willem Dafoe was chilling as Ryuk, i honestly could not think of a better actor for the role and it looks like it just came so naturally for him as all he had to do was channel his inner Green Goblin. As far as being faithful goes Ryuk is as close to the anime as anything in this film gets. Lakeith Stanfield plays the infamous L and i thought his portrayal of the character was very fascinating. He emulated some of the quirks that are integral to his character but made the role his own in a way which made him so fascinating to watch. \n\nAs for the rest of the roles, Margaret Qualley puts in a great performance as Mia Sutton and is a great companion to Light in the film, she also has a very strong arc throughout the film. Shea Whigham is good as James Turner and Paul Nakauchi has a small but impactful role as Watari, L's handler. \n\nThe plot of the film borrows from a number of events that occur within the original Anime but does stray far away from the Anime at times, especially as the film comes to a close. And i have to say I welcome these changes and prefer this approach than a direct translation from the series. A lot happens in Death Note's 37 episodes so trying to translate all of that into a feature length film and have it work would be nearly impossible. I think they even struggled to cram everything into this film, and they went off track quite a lot. I liked the changes and the turns the film takes towards its finale but i still think it would have been more effective it it progressed at a slower pace and the story was split into two films. Because they gave themselves the task of covering a lot in a little over an hour and a half some of the daunting intensity felt throughout the original Anime isn't represented as well here. There are some moments but not to the scale of the 2006 classic. \n\nSo in the end i have to say i very much enjoyed this film but it could have and probably should have been better. The fast pace did take away from being able to really focus on some key moments and as a result some stuff just flies by. The incorporation of blood and gore was ok but it did feel out of place, a little like a Final Destination film, it's just there for the sake of being disturbing. There are other ways to be dark and gritty without blood and gore but it is what it is. The story i thought was good in the way it takes from the Anime but also spins events and does its own thing quite a bit. The ending raps up very quickly and again that just goes back to having to do so much in so little time. The performances are a big highlight and i would really like to see a sequel to this film just to see the new direction they could take things. \n\n6.4/10",

Sure, I totally believe the scared kid running from everything for most of the movie did that... \n\nL, at least was about what I expected since I knew they would never be able to flush out any of the characters to their true potential. But since Light is such a joke it never feels like super detective needed to be called in except for the fact that the regular cops are as much or more of a joke than Light. I mean I'm sure any cop would be fooled by the person they are tailing putting their hat on someone else while at a school dance.\n\nMia is about what I would have expected from Hollywood getting hold of the original Misa character but we are given no backstory or reason for why she wants to be part of all this killing, other than \"I'm a high school cheerleader and was bored\" or some equally forgettable line with the same meaning.\n\nThen there are all the plot holes, why are half the characters doing what they do(looking at you Mia and Ryuk)? If there were a bunch of kids trained to be super detectives why is only L involved? Why does Light, who is supposedly quite intelligent, start spouting off to someone he barely knows about his killer note book after talking to her for 5 seconds?\n\nAnd don't get me started on the butchering of the source material. If Death Note was good enough to make a movie adaption of why was 99% of what made it good thrown out and 90% of everything else add in for good messure. Good material is good material there is no need to make it \"better.\" I get that condensing 12hrs of anime into 2 hours of movie needs some changes. That is no excuse for turning an intelligent sociopath who after trying the Death Note by his own choice and was excited to continue using it, always, ALWAYS, acts with a plan, who is only stopped from reshaping the world to his vision by the smallest of mistakes by another person, and turning him into a scared, bullied, emotional, little b!$*# who is pushed into using the Death Note at almost every turn only to end up seeing owning the Death Note as the lesser of two evils. I'll end the fan rant their because I could go on and on and on and, well you get the point.\n\nTL;DR: Skip this garbage and watch/read anything else from the Death Note series.",

Sure, I totally believe the scared kid running from everything for most of the movie did that... \n\nL, at least was about what I expected since I knew they would never be able to flush out any of the characters to their true potential. But since Light is such a joke it never feels like super detective needed to be called in except for the fact that the regular cops are as much or more of a joke than Light. I mean I'm sure any cop would be fooled by the person they are tailing putting their hat on someone else while at a school dance.\n\nMia is about what I would have expected from Hollywood getting hold of the original Misa character but we are given no backstory or reason for why she wants to be part of all this killing, other than \"I'm a high school cheerleader and was bored\" or some equally forgettable line with the same meaning.\n\nThen there are all the plot holes, why are half the characters doing what they do(looking at you Mia and Ryuk)? If there were a bunch of kids trained to be super detectives why is only L involved? Why does Light, who is supposedly quite intelligent, start spouting off to someone he barely knows about his killer note book after talking to her for 5 seconds?\n\nAnd don't get me started on the butchering of the source material. If Death Note was good enough to make a movie adaption of why was 99% of what made it good thrown out and 90% of everything else add in for good messure. Good material is good material there is no need to make it \"better.\" I get that condensing 12hrs of anime into 2 hours of movie needs some changes. That is no excuse for turning an intelligent sociopath who after trying the Death Note by his own choice and was excited to continue using it, always, ALWAYS, acts with a plan, who is only stopped from reshaping the world to his vision by the smallest of mistakes by another person, and turning him into a scared, bullied, emotional, little b!$*# who is pushed into using the Death Note at almost every turn only to end up seeing owning the Death Note as the lesser of two evils. I'll end the fan rant their because I could go on and on and on and, well you get the point.\n\nTL;DR: Skip this garbage and watch/read anything else from the Death Note series.",

            "content": "I am a huge fan of the Anime and Manga and this feels like almost an insult to the source material not to the extent of DBZ Evolution, but still bad and hard to watch. Awkward acting, out of place forced feeling cursing for no reason, and some pretty glaring plot holes. Their is a lot I feel they could've done better truly. Their characterization of Light and L feels like a betrayal of how intelligent and level headed they are, yet the movie makes Light look like a dolt with almost no intelligence and a lack of ability to keep his cool as he did in the anime. L's portrayal was surprisingly good for his first few appearances were shockingly on character and felt very like L (Note he behaves like L but he does some things L would never do. I'd go into detail but I want to avoid spoilers) should; very withdrawan, silent, and socially awkward. However in his later appearances later in the film was of the rails and far from how level headed L would ever behave. Plus there is the added rules to the death note and the conversion of Ryuke into almost a villain, while in the source material he's more of a neutral 3rd party. I do have more problems and gripes about this film, but I will say maybe if I haven't watched the superior source material first it might be halfway enjoyable. I'll say the best thing this movie might do is push more people to watch the anime and I feel like that is a good enough cause for this movie to exist. But I feel like a review isn't complete without saying what they could have done better otherwise it's just film bashing. Obviously the one glaring thing they could've done was follow the source material, and I'll take that a step further and say just follow the L ark (In my opinion the bestimate part of death note, they could've end the Manga and anime it was a perfect ending). The L ark would have been perfect infact it's almost the L Ark in the movie just a very weak version of it. But if they wanted to keep the same story I say make Light seem more intelligent and level headed add scenes where we can see inside Light's and L's head so we can see a battle of wits and add some tension. (semi spoilers ahead) Just imagine the chase scene in the film if it cut back and forth between their thoughts of how to outsmart each other it would've been a huge game of cat a mouse, a giant moving chess game. Just seeing the battle of wit would have added a lot otherwise this movie feels like it fails to make u think about what's right and wrong like the anime. You can turn your brain off and watch the action and for source material like death note I find it very sad. In conclusion this is a very disappointing representation of Death Note, it exists and I guess it's a good enough thing as long as it pushes someone out there to give the source material a shot. \nI hope you guys like this it's the first review I've written but I had to say something about this movie",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT!\n\nDeath Note (2017), is the newest venture from director Adam Wingard to create an adaptation from the original manga/anime source. The premise is that a student named Light Turner (played by Nat Wolff) discovers a notebook on the grounds of his school, and this 'Death Note' is filled with rules that instruct how one can kill another person by writing down their name in the book. After watching Death Note (2017), my emotions ranged from: boredom at how uninspired the performances were - to anger at how little respect Wingard has for the audience's intelligence. Now I do want to take some time and preface by saying that I have not watched the anime that this film is loosely based on; I did read the manga, but it has been so long that I don't remember much about it. So, this review will be solely based on the merits of the film itself!\n\nSo, the idea that is presented at the beginning of the film is interesting, but the problems that arise come from Adam Wingard's direction for this adaptation - as well as Jeremy Slater, (who worked on such great projects like Fant4stic) and his sub-par screen writing. Right off the bat we are met with one of the 'cringiest' man screams of all time, and a scene of a school bully being killed in a sequence that is pretty much carbon copied from Final Destination. Another cinematic misstep of this movie is the inappropriate overuse of Dutch angles; this direction makes Adam Wingard just seem like he doesn't know when to use cinematic techniques appropriately...\n\nThis film also has a lot infuriatingly dumb plot-holes, so be prepared to for a lot of moments that seem contrived and not well thought out. Some of the questions that were running through my head include: Why on Earth would you keep talking and further implicating that you are Kira to a guy who has told you that he is hunting you? Imagine if L didn't have any resources or backing from the police force in perusing Kira? If he had recorded the responses that Light gave at the diner the police would treat the conversation as suspicious, and would probably be more willing to give L support! Another glaring plot-hole is the scene where Mia (Margaret Qualley) takes the Death Note from Light at the Ferris wheel. When she grabs the notebook Light reveals that he has written her name in the Death Note. Once this information is revealed to the audience the Ferris wheel falls apart and Mia dies. Now, I want to ask this question: what was Light's plan if he could convince Mia not to take the Death Note? Both of their names are still written in it, and the movie clearly establishes that the owner of the Death Note can only burn one name! Even if he did convince her to not take the Death Note, and was able to burn the page with Mia's name; he is still going to die of a heart attack since his name is still written in the notebook! He would have to give the Death Note to Mia so she could become the new owner of the Death Note, and then be able to burn the page with his name!\n\nThe previous example that was given then leads into the biggest problem with the whole movie; that the established rules are not taken advantage of. The whole ending scene is so contrived and forced that all of it could have been avoided if Light just burned the page with his name from the Death Note after Mia told him about it. The film clearly shows that she didn't write down any special conditions preventing him from burning the page! Why couldn't she have written down that Light was to give the Death Note to her before midnight, and that his heart was supposed to stop at 12:05? That would have guaranteed that she would get the notebook, and still have plenty of time to burn the page to prevent Light's heart from stopping!\n\nSo, before I wrap up this review I do want to give this movie some credit where it's due. William Dafoe as Ryuk was an excellent choice, but there was defiantly not enough of him in the movie (which was the biggest reason why most people wanted to see Death Note (2017) in the first place) to make this film enjoyable. Keith Stanfield (L) did a decent job with his performance, and in many ways his character was the best part of the film. Being the character that is pitted against Light, who can kill people at will, with nothing more than his mind is inherently interesting. It's just too bad that the director and screenwriter didn't know how to effectively adapt this idea into a Netflix Original Movie.",

This film isn't a condensed version of the anime. It is an original work that takes a lot of great elements from the source material and adds additional twists and yes does take some liberties. Of course there will be many differences especially since the location is totally different, but with so much great source material this was an enjoyable stand-alone film. It was plenty enthralling for me as things started to escalate and I wasn't sure what was going to happen. Obviously, some things you will predict if you know the series, but like I said this is a new story and it does not follow the storyline exactly, so I didn't know how things would end up. I say if you don't know what Death Note is and you like this film, you should watch the Anime because you will really love it. If you are looking for this to be a live-action transcription of the Anime then you won't get that because that is impossible and why would that be needed? It would be interesting to see other story lines also, what if this book was dropped in South America instead or elsewhere? Or a different time period? I hope there is more of this because it is interesting to examine the issues that come up when you think about these gray areas of ethics and fine lines. Also of course thinking about what would you do in these situations. That's really what makes the story compelling.",

            "content": "Is Death Note, Death Not worth watching?\n\nBack when the teaser hit on March 22nd, 2017, the internet was rife with fury after the sanctity of the Death Note franchise was called into question. This new adaptation saw many controversial changes to the original story such as a younger Light, a more social L, and a setting change from Japan to America. And the overall question is, did it turn it out ok? And yeah... I quite think it did.\nSo... an adaptation of death note huh? One of the most intelligently written anime/manga ever brought into existence, and Netflix decided to make an adaptation of that? Well, you could see why people were skeptical. The important thing to remember here though is that is indeed an adaptation. And by my mark, a good adaptation stands on what new things it brings to the table as opposed to what it gets from the original, that being said, things such as an original works soul, I feel, is important to keep intact.\n\nDoes Netflix's Death Note do this? Well sadly not, but considering the overall premise to the plot, I don't think it was possible, however, the feeling this movie does have, although not really reminiscent of the original work, is still a thrilling justice narrative that kept me invested. Instead of following the story beats from the original works, either from the anime or the manga, Netflix's version deviates, such that maintaining the feel of the original becomes very hard to do. Without spoiling, the new interpretations of Light, Misa, and L changes the dynamic of the story as to where it becomes less a battle of two intelligent minds on a battle for justice, and more about how long two kids can get away with killing people with a smart detective on their tail. And just to be clear this set up isn't bad, it's just not as smart as the original, the setup still works for the film, and if it didn't have to be compared to the anime it would stand up pretty well. \n\n\nThe performances in this film were also pretty good, but nothing I felt outstanding to really remark on, well with the exception of Willem Defoe as Ryuk, who was brilliant as a menacing figure looking over light. However, with him as well as a lot of other characters I felt like there was a clear difference in tone with their personalities from the source material, characters who I liked more in the anime seemed to be harsher here and I don't think I enjoyed them as much, with a clear example being Ryuk himself. As opposed to the anime where he's more of a comic relief, who is constantly portrayed as a bored deity waiting for something to happen, he's portrayed in this adaptation as a particularly menacing bored deity waiting for something to happen, even at one-point threatening Light\n\n\nAlthough not being a faithful adaptation of the original story, I'd say this is still a good adaptation\nof the concept of the death note. As I said before the dynamic of what made the soul of the anime and manga is gone. Lights no longer a genius, they notably made some changes to L and Misa(which I cannot disclose for spoiler reasons) and as such the story takes many different routes and divulges from the original concept, however, it is still good, not as great as the original, but definitely worth watching, and if you don't like it, at least it's a reminder of how great the anime is in comparison right?",

I'm gonna go out and say that I don't have that much knowledge of the anime show as I only watched the first episode, and consider that this movie wasn't even close to being similar to it, I kind of just didn't care about the comparisons as I didn't really watch that show. What got me into watching however, was that my friend wanted me to see it with him, and he's a fan of the show. So I was curious to see what his opinion of the movie was, and when we finished it, he said that the whole movie itself is not even close to being similar to the show, but he still enjoy it the same way that I did. He realize that America was going to make their own version of Death Note, which I was saying that as long as it has the spirit of what made the show popular, it wouldn't matter, and we both think the movie did. The acting in this is really good, whether it be Nat Wolff, Keith Sandford, which my friend say that he was actually pretty faithful to the film, and Willem Dafoe who is excellent in this and is the best part of the film. The visual effects look pretty good, and they did get the design of Ryuk right. The score by Atticus Ross and Leopold Ross is catchy, which almost sounded anime at times, and I was interested in what's going on, while getting to know a bit about the characters, even if it's a bit simplified. I didn't really know where it's going, and I wasn't even quite sure how the characters were going to get out of it. The issues that I have with it, are that the plot is all over the place, which it can't focus on a single plot line without going to another, and the Watari character had a really dumb moment when dealing with Light, which I can't say without going into spoilers. I did want to see a bit more of Ryuk as he's always enjoyable to watch, but those are small issues as Death Note, in my opinion, is a great movie that makes me want to actually watch the anime show, even if it's very different.",

Unfortunately, by needlessly throwing most of the source material's plot out the window, Adam Wingard botches what should have been an easy home run for Netflix. With Willem Dafoe perfectly cast as the death god Ryuk, the production was off to a great start, but a slew of other bad casting choices hamstring it straight out of the gate. Many of the characters' appearances in the original anime and manga were deliberately designed to convey certain important characteristics about them. For example, the scary thing about Light Yagami was that he was a very clean, composed, and straight A student who had a very promising future ahead of him, yet even someone as seemingly good-natured and well-kempt as him could succumb to the temptations of the death note and subtly turn into a sociopath. This whole element is entirely lost on this film's narrative, with Nat Wolff's appearance giving the impression that he's just some emo kid with a chip on his shoulder, yet at the same time his portrayal tries to skirt his sociopathic tendencies by refusing to use the death note to kill law enforcement, in stark contrast to the anime. This makes for an incredibly boring reinvention of the character by not forcing him to make tougher morally gray decisions and strictly having him focus on criminals. Thankfully, although L's appearance doesn't even try for accuracy, his portrayal is considerably more on-point, with LaKeith Stanfield nailing many of the quirky mannerisms that make L such a fun character. However the narrative fails to convey L's genius and deductive capabilities as effectively as the anime did. Further still, we have the character of \"Mia\" who is completely invented and non-canon to the original story, and cheapens the plot by serving as a generic \"impress the girl\" motivation for Light's decisions. One thing to this movie's credit over the anime though was the relationship between Watari and L. Not just a mere assistant this time around, Watari takes on something of a caretaker and close friend to L as well, and this ends up working very effectively in adding some extra depth to these characters and setting up one of the few original twists in the plot that actually worked. It's just too bad that most of the other twists largely fall flat, aren't particularly interesting, and ultimately culminate in an abrupt anticlimactic ending that leaves the whole film feeling rather unsatisfying. And finally, what the hell is up with the totally out-of-place 80s synth rock soundtrack? This should have a dark noir atmosphere, not 80s cheeseball goofiness. Stupid decisions all around.",

            "content": "Even though this film may not be as bad as Dragon Ball Evolution or this year's remake of Ghost in the Shell, the live-action Death Note ultimately falls victim to many of the pratfalls many western adaptations of anime and manga have had before. Disregarding the source material isn't enough to save the film from b-movie plotting, inconsistent characterization and a story that considers narrative cohesion a foreign concept. Despite some interesting visuals and a couple standout performances (Willem Dafoe is delightfully hammy as Ryuk), the internal logic and insight on morality and crime from the source material are virtually nonexistent, and the film suffers from trying to cram the bulk of the anime and manga into a single 100-minute film. It's particularly telling that the film was put online, since it's clear that WB and Viz must have known it would flop as a theatrical release (the former decided to shift their focus to DC, Lego and Harry Potter and the latter removed their name from the opening vanity plates). The only thing that keeps the film from reaching the abysmal godawfulness of The Last Airbender is that it makes a fairly entertaining black comedy with the right mindset. It's probably the most unintentionally-hilarious movie I've seen in ages, and I've seen The Room. As an adaptation, it pales compared to the source material, which I absolutely love. As a film on its own, it's overblown as a story and has actors desperately trying to hold back laughter at the script. As a potential franchise, it probably won't get its planned sequel; which may be the biggest joke of all if the ending is any indication. Even with the  film's best efforts, the live-action Death Note is a hot mess of a thriller and not up to the standards Netflix usually sets for their content. It may pass for muster as an unintentional parody of the series, but otherwise; it feels like all of the anime and manga were mashed together with an after school special and a SyFy originals movie and put in a blender. The source material, its fans and audiences deserve better than this piece of glorified teen fan fiction; and the potential of its AU is wasted on a film that feels like a bad episode of CSI. Unless you feel like unintentionally laughing for an hour and 40 minutes, you can go ahead and burn the page from your note of this movie.",

            "content": "Death Note is a beautiful manga written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. Both the anime and manga, exemplify the sense of justice and how man playing god can corrupt and poison one's mind. Light is shown as someone who is a very intellectual and popular student, however, is bored with how simple everything in his life is. The story ventures a path that battles what is right and just. The series shifts our sympathies between characters which is an art in itself. This movie however, discards it all and just uses the character names and the concept of a Death Note. \nThe movie is whitewashed and Light is portrayed as a typical American movie style High School nerd who is not really noticed by anyone. In the anime/manga, Light is very popular and does not scream or swear as much as shown in the movie. Light's intellectual side is not really portrayed in the movie and his sense of justice or humanity and shifting monstrosity is lightly explored. L's intellectual capability is shown lightly but his character and nature is not very well explored nor shown thus our sympathies does not shift. In the movie Ryuk is given little screen time and is always shown as the Death God (Shinigami) in the background. His personality is not really shown and he is always in a way antagonistic towards Light. In the series, he is shown a lot more often and plays a significant role. He is shown as an observer of it all but helps Light at times and communicates in a less antagonistic way although he in his own way the enemy. His obsession of apples is only shown a light although apples work like cigarettes for the Death Gods in this universe. \nThe Shinigami realm is not explored in the movie which is quite sad and many rules are changed and modified as well as some of them being gone against. For example, if the cause of death is not specified then the person will just die of a heart attack. In the movie, Watari's death is not specified yet he is shot to death. Another example is the fact that only Light can see Ryuk. The rules state that anyone who touches the Death Note can see the Shinigami. Another rule that is disobeyed is the fact that Ryuk in his own way helps Mia's (This movie's version of Misa) death as well as others. I, myself, am not entirely sure if he helped or not but a Death God cannot do that. Another rule in the movie is that only one page can be torn and burned to deactivate the effects of the note. In the series, if the name is written, they shall die and every page no matter what. The death note specifically states that \"once the victim's name has been written, the individual's death can never be avoided\". The only way to stop and reverse death is the use of the death eraser which was never introduced in the main series but could have been introduced in the movie (refer to pilot chapter). Another rule is that every page torn will have the full effects of the death note. The movie never mentions the idea of a human possessing Shinigami eyes nor the fact that the Death Note is not Ryuk's but Shindoh's or the fact that Ryuk owns two Death Notes. \nMost of this probably could have not been included as it is only just one movie based off an entire series. However, some parts could have been changed and it could have spanned over a few movies. The movie itself seemed rushed and the movie's idea of gore and Light's idea of making out with Mia whilst kissing makes no sense as it leaves Light with little or no morals and his godlike complex is not really explored. The idea of Kira is also lightly shown and how the people worship Kira is also not shown. \nThe movie was good in some parts and there were some good quotes. It is good they avoided the Near/Mellow arc and L's death as it was not really a good part of the series. The movie could have included L's famous theme which was written in alternating 7/8 and 3/4 time to indicate L's unusualness and difference from everyone. However, the sound effects and music was good at creating suspense and confusion and suited the moods of each scene (except Mia's death but that's fine- also sidenote- I love how Mia fell into a bunch of flowers and died, makes me remember of something? \"Why do the best people die? When you pick flowers, which ones do you pick? The most beautiful ones :) \"   ANYWAYSSSSS). The movie should be watched as if it is a completely different thing from the series and I guess people who have never watched or read Death Note may like it. \nTo sum it up, the movie had a lot of terrible things and portrayed each character quite badly especially by making Light weak and apparently unable to handle the Death Note and making him swear almost every minute. It is alright that the movie did not include everything and the ethnicity of the characters did not concern me. However, portrayal of major themes or characters or involvement of characters could be improved and as well as many other things. The ending was fitting for the movie and made sense but how did L know how the Death Note worked? And why was Light so careless about killing? Other than this it was okay but not good enough. Too much crammed into one movie and too much white washing and predictability even though the movie was different from the series (I predicted how Mia's death would happen and I was close). Ryuk should have had more involvement in the movie. The movie should have explained and shown more into the Death God concept and should have explored further into what is justice and who is right. If it did this then our sympathies would shift. The series did this. Shakespeare did this as well especially in the Merchant of Venice. The concept of human boundaries and man playing god should have been explored as well. The series did this. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley did this. I base most of my writings and many of my things off Death Note. I named one of my beloved chickens Kira as I was obsessed and loved the series. This movie... Shame on it... Should have done better. I am sorry to say but it is not one I will revisit again.",

Mia isn't supposed to be this ruthless and heartless murderer.

Let me rephrase this, a law enforcer, the one who abides and enforces the law wishes to murder Light and countless other civilians who happened to be driving and/or walking about.  The plot is really bad, none of the deaths have any weight to them, it doesn't feel like a psychological/thriller movie or an action movie. It doesn't know what it wants to be.

Second the movie focuses too much on Light and Mia's relationship (also I believe Mia is supposed to be Takada not Misa despite the similarity in name.) and not enough on the dynamic between Ryuk and Light or L and Light. The movie strongly hints that Ryuk is not to be trusted and that he and Light will eventually be at odds, but nothing ever comes of it sadly. The third critism is that that the first part of the movie acts like a horror movie before acting more like Death Note. Ryuk is portrayed as a scary monster at first and the first 2 deaths are extremely gory for no reason. (there isn't even any blood for the remaining deaths and most of them happen off screen) Overall though it's still pretty enjoyable, so long as you don't get hung up on the fact that it's inspired by Death Note and not a direct 1 to 1 adaptation.",

A new person gets the Death Note and they are more psychotic than Light but smarter. I don't know. It's just disappointing how lazy Hollywood gets. All I wanted was a brand new story with new characters that just happens to have a Death Note. PS They changed the music which was in itself a character in the anime.",

Willem Dafoe and LaKeith Stanfield elevate a perfunctory script and deliver outstanding performances while Adam Wingard brings a charming and erratic style to the direction. Nat Wolff, on the other hand, delivers perhaps one of the worst performances of his relatively short career and holds the film back from being something truly special. There's also some noticeable pacing problems, but that's again the result of a mediocre screenplay that could have used another polish or ten. Regardless, Death Note is a solid B movie and easily worth the hour-and-a-half investment if only for Dafoe and Stanfield and the intriguing premise.",

Ryuk appears in front of Light (this movie's way of saying someone is about to die from their name written in the death note) and begins laughing as he says \"You humans are very interesting.\" And then the credits roll, leaving the plot unresolved and clearly banking on a sequel.\n\n\nAll in all, an interesting spin on the source material, but holding itself back to much to be truly good.",

However, they do not detract from this film's swift simple story.\n\nAs someone who is unfamiliar with the entirety of the Death Note universe, this movie is a great entry point into the mythos. I found myself entertained and distinctly noticed the comic themes and origins - and was entertained regardless. \n\nSo insatiable was my enjoyment of the movie, I started the anime series. I do see how perhaps this could work as a series and there is a potitental for second film to follow up here to incorporate other elements from the comic and anime origins. \n\nHowever, I can also see that the film seems to be effectivly streamlined and made for American audiences. There is a genuine creep factor to Ryku. Light and his girlfriend Misa show how the quest for justice by killing criminals can lead to the insanity of trying to hold onto the power and control it. \n\nLike any other film adaptations to a universe of preestablished comic universes - the 100 minute run time of the film allows for a brink introduction (and very likely leaves out fan favorite scenes or characters) but does a good job of introducing us to L, Light, and Ryuk.",

However, I went into this movie with as open a mind as possible, and was very surprised. Adam Wingard stylishly reimagines the familiar characters and story of Death Note, painting them in an image that's different from what we're used to, yet still captivating and harrowing. The performances of Willem Dafoe and Lakeith Stanfield carry the movie, accompanied by satisfactory acts from Nat Wolff and Margaret Qualley as well. Throw in an electric score by Atticus Ross and intriguing cinematography, and the only thing I can really complain about is the muddled storytelling. The plot unfolds speedily and unsteadily, leaving perhaps a few too many elements for the audience to figure out on their own. At times we're forced to recall a scene or element earlier in the film that was touched on very little to understand a later scene or element that's touched on very heavily. All of this inexplicably leads to the ending, which was surprisingly well done in my opinion. The movie ends on an ambiguous, heart-pounding note with at least most loose ends tied.\nThis film is not a masterpiece, but it is no train wreck either. Wingard's reimagined Death Note can be thoroughly appreciated and entertaining as long as its viewers don't relentlessly compare it to its source material. Despite its flaws, Death Note is thrilling, dark, and captivating, and I will definitely be watching it again in the future.",

            "content": "It's hard to not go into this film without comparing it to the original source material. Death Note(2017) is an attempt at adapting the famous and well beloved Manga/Anime series, but fails due to large misunderstandings as to what the series was about, while also trying to define itself apart from other adaptations by trying to re-invent much of what many loved about the series. \n\nThe plot involves Light Turner finding the Death Note, a notebook that allows the user to kill anyone who writes their name in the book, and uses it to enact his own sense of Justice by ridding the world of criminals, while also evading the famous detective L and other police agencies from finding out that he is the one causing these unusual deaths. While this is the base of the plot taken from the Manga and Anime, it puts more emphasis on focusing on Light and his relationship with Mia Sutton, this film's version of the character Misa Misa, and how the book affects him. And while it is notable that the film tries to define itself away from other adaptations, and even the source material itself, the plot includes certain aspects from the original work, but minimizes what was considered key points in the story. This includes the game of cat and mouse that Light and L play against each other, which becomes more of a back-drop to the film rather than a focus. Even the Raye Pember story arc becomes a simple five second plot device that defines what the Death Note does to a character that isn't Light himself. \n\nNone of the characters, with the small exception of Ryuk, reflect who they were in the original work. Light is shown to have some amount of debatable intelligence, but it's never truly shown until towards the end of the film. However, Light is also shown to have more human emotions toward handling the book, showing large amounts of fear upon first seeing Ryuk and even loving Mia, something that Light had never reciprocated to Misa Misa in the Anime/Manga. Mia does not resemble trait that Misa Misa had, with the exception of loving Light. Interestingly enough, she resembles more of what Light was in the Anime/Manga, in which she becomes obsessed with the Death Note and enacting justice. Light even contemplates to not use the book anymore, while Mia would continue to use the book for what she believes would be good. Ryuk is the only character who resembles his Anime/Manga counterpart, but his role in the plot is much more involved than in the original work. Rather Ryuk is more of an instigator of events, tempting Light and feigning loyalty, rather than being a mere observer. The character who took the most in a change of character is L, in which he is much more emotion driven than his calm and calculative Anime/Manga counterpart. \n\nWhile there are more that can be said about the differences about the characters, what is certain is that these changes do not make them more likable than they used to be. It's understandable that it is difficult to create a likable villainous character, but it is not entirely impossible. Examples of this can be found in House of Card's Frank Underwood, Breaking Bad's Walter White, and of course, Light Yagami himself. What made them likable wasn't being able to sympathize with their actions, but to enjoy how they executed their actions. Each move they made was equivalent to someone play a high-stakes game of chess. This aspect of the series, along with many of the quirks of some characters and the other minor characters who brought more humanity and color to the series, was missing. Again, this is understandable due to the difficulty of condensing a 37 episode show into less than 2 hours. Yet a possible path they could've taken was split the story into two films, much like what was done with the first live-action adaption of Death Note. \n\nFinal Thoughts:\nIt's easy to see that some effort was put into this film. Yet the effort was put into trying veer away from it's source material, instead of trying to embrace it. The film is not entirely terrible, with an interesting twist between the characters of Light and Mia. However, this film does not fulfill the standard of a Death Note live-action adaptation. In fact, that standard had already been met years ago in Japan. It would've been interesting to see the Death Note take effect in the west, even staging a new story after the original Death Note story had taken place. However, this film is not that, but just an attempt to westernize the original work. If you, the viewer, are look for a true adaption of Death Note, look to the the 2006 film and it's sequel, which does include some minor and major changes to the plot, but only do so to have a present a different ending to the series, rather than reinvent it altogether.",

That's what they did to Light, as academically excellent which is viewed as basically popular in Japan and they stuck him in America and made him an unpopular high school nerd. As much as there are a lot of readaptations of Batman, they still kept him in Gotham, he still had his fortune, and he was always Bruce Wayne. Another negative of the movie, I'm noticing how smug the director and producers are being about how this was a \"piece of art\" when they have been receiving th same amount of bad reviews as good. What I want coming out of this is for there to be no sequel. You shouldn't be going into a readaptation with no thoughts about the original source material but instead what you want to do, it's almost plagiarism.",

            "content": "I honestly just made an account to rate this trash. Ok, so I first watched the anime in march and immediately loved it. I also read a bit of the manga and I thought it to be also enjoyable, so know that I was pretty excited to hear that an anime I really love was going to have an American adaptation on Netflix. Boy did actually seeing the movie totally change that excited feeling into one of disappointment and annoyance. So first off to let you know if you're like me and watched the anime DO NOT expect this to similar to the anime/manga at all because it's pretty different and doesn't do it justice. However, if you're bored and feel like watching a gorey, emo love story, boring plot movie than you've hit the jackpot! Potential spoilers but not really: okay so first off they change some of the rules of the death note which I thought was pretty unessary, but can kind of be overlooked if you believe hard enough. Nat Wolff as light was a HORRIBLE casting choice as he is a bad actor. His delivery was stale, and he makes light seem like a stupid bag of rocks who just wants to get with his emo cheerleader girlfriend. Light manipulated Misa in the anime and never really loved her, but that's goes out the window in this adaptation to make room for that emo love(TM). The romance is rushed and forced making you cringe at times, but isint as bad as the other aspects well actually never mind all of the aspects are trash. Next Light in the anime was smart, he knew what action to take to make sure he wouldn't be caught as Kira, and did a pretty damn good job of L wasn't such a good detective. In this movie Light is so stupid it makes you laugh. He's a bit impulsive and is not like yagami light in the fact that he doesn't really have patience and doesn't have originals light's impressive intelligence. Then there is L. I mean at the beginning he was okay, but as the movie progressed he became extremely out of character and itbreallu confused me. Also he finds out that Light is Kira way to quick, and in the anime he would never just go confront him, but in this crappy adaptation anything stupid is possible. William Dafoe as Ryuk was the only thing I enjoyed and at the end of the day I did fall asleep during the last thirty minutes which is really all I had to save to tell you how bad it was. In conclusion, if you loved the anime and were or are expecting a good adaptation I do not recommend watching it. If you just want a movie to fill the boredom then, I mean, it's not the worst. I give it 1/2 stars and I'm also bitter that there was no potato chip scene, also no matsuda or Aizawa? Then again, they could've have been in the parts I fell asleep lol.",

(Which was in the original short in some way. But guess what? The writer realized how fucking stupid it was and took it out)\n\nNow for the characters....\n\nL is a little bitch in the movie who is almost never calm and collected as he should be. Rather they have him constantly shaking, studdering, crying and shouting orders like \"Now!\". Also has no sense of humor. No flaws in his views of justice. Lastly no fighting skills. He gets thrown around by Mr. Turner and knocked out by some dish washer while holding a goddamn toy laser gun that im surprised didn't go \"pew pew pew\".\n\nLight is a goddamn pansy who apparently in this one has time for love and is just a misunderstood guy with a crush on the \"badass\" cheerleader who hates the world. His whole fucking story here seems to only be targeted for those dumbass teens who do the \"he's my Joker and she's my Harley\" for real. From the cheesy ass emo love songs to the AHS \"Normal people scare me\" magnet hanging in the locker.\n\nMr. Turner aka Mr. Yagami loses all honor the original character had at the end. The original believed in the law even if it was his own son commiting the murders he would bring kira to justice. But NOPE.  Who needs a character with strong morals, right?\n\nThis film spat on the characters and series I love by using the names to attract the fanbase but destroying their characters and pick and choosing which bits of lore to honor. And I strongly urge all that love the series as I do to stay away from this dumpster fire.

The problem is that, historically, live-action adaptations... well they tend to suck (even the not-sucky ones are either way to bizarre, or just meh)... but let's move on to the rest of my thoughts.\n\nPersonality-Wise, Willem Dafoe & Lakeith Stanfield came the closest to their anime counterparts as Ryuk the Shinigami (god of death) and the great detective knowm simply as \"L\" respectively, with Stanfield starting out as a strong L, though devolving into something, that, while still a strong Character, was too emotional for a character like L, while I felt Dafoe, pretty much nailed Ryuk's manic glee in watching a human use the Death Note.\n\nShea Wingham was okay, as Detective James Turner, having a weird arc throughout the movie of going from slightly unlikable to being too much of a sad sap in my eyes (His anime counterpart, Soichiro Yagami, was also very protective of Light, but he never let his personal feelings get in the way of the investigation)... but the two worst characters had to be the main leads: Light Turner, played by Natt Wolf and Mia Sutton played by Margaret Qualley. Both characters seemed like they had PARTS that connected them to their anime counterparts (Light Yagami & Misa Amane, respectively)... but the similarities stopped at VERY bare bones basics, with Mia being a sort of Lady Macbeth character whose pride and ambition led to her downfall (very unlike Misa, who was a bit dim, but so obsessed with Light, she'd even kill for him), while Light... well, there's no two ways around it... he was a moron at some points and too much of a sad sap at others. His anime counterpart was an idealistic, cold and calculating sociopath who wanted to simply become the God of a new world free of crime... but this Light seemed more like a scared little kid than anything else. Hell, he's even a bit too liberal with his \"Secret Identity\" and does a terrible job at hiding It, going so far as to order around a future victim over the phone in broad daylight WHILE BEING TAILED BY POLICE!\n\nMy biggest problem with the movie was that it only seemed to have a basic understanding of the original anime... without understanding the characters themselves. \n\nYes, L did call out Kira through a press conference, but he never showed his face to anyone outside the Kira Task Force. \n\nYes, Ryuk did explain SOME rules for the notebook, but he never wrote down every single rule. Hell, LIGHT was the one who figured how to use the Death Note to its full potential in the Original (playing off the idea that he's supposed to be a child prodigy).\n\n While I did enjoy it slightly more than OTHER American adaptations of anime (Hi Dragonball Evolution. Hi, Astro Boy!) It still felt like there wasn't enough understanding of the Anime for the movie to do justice to the source material... and I think that hurt it in the long run.",

I loved the original series but what I find hard in this film is that there really doesn't feel as if there is any real intelligence in the acts of Light and L. In the manga and Anime Light and L are constantly outmaneuvering each other in a tactic battle for survival. All the moves they make in this film don't pan out or surprise. Mia in this version while at first interesting on the surface ultimately proved to be lacking serious motivations. Mia's manga counterpart, Misa, was in love with Light because he killed the man who murdered her parents. This film's Mia just seems more invested in the death note and Light because it gives her a thrill. They delved into some interesting territory with her using the death note against Light in one point in the story, though it ultimately doesn't lead anywhere too interesting. the end almost feels like they tried to make Mia and Light into some tragic love story about how power corrupts. I think this could work if this movie had been a miniseries thought, but it's not. The only Aspect of this film i throughly enjoyed were of William Dafoe as Ryuk. Even there Ryuk gives almost no real effect to the plot, he doesn't even feel like an interested observer in this iteration, just a demon on the shoulder character that only seems to take away from the Light's agency. The ending as well was stupid in that it left an annoying cliff hanger that again could have proved interesting, Does L write Light's name in the death note, abandoning his claim to be a man who brings criminals to justice and making him exactly like Light? We'll probably never know because I doubt anyone's going to ask for a sequel.",

As long as you see this as its own thing and stop looking for things from the original you'll probably enjoy it. The only thing I didn't like was how they changed L. This L is very emotional and reckless. It's kind of hard to believe that he is a world-famous detective. The original L was eccentric, but was intelligent and careful. Ryuk was amazing in this movie. The only thing that  brought this movie down besides  L's portrayal was how little we got to see of Ryuk. Ryuk got a couple of good laughs out of me when he was there but he just sort of appeared and disappeared when the script called for him. I would have loved to see him lingering in the background or just doing something.

The results here, however, are not\u00c2\u00a0as spectacular.",

            "content": "Attempting to condense almost the entirety of a properties source material into a single film adaptation can go one of two ways: Either we're treated to a detailed and engaging film that covers all necessary ground while remaining true to its origins, or it turns out like a steaming pile of horse manure. Most of Hollywood's attempts to bring beloved shows/manga like Death Note fit into the latter outcome, and Adam Wingard's recreation of the vastly popular television/book series is definitely messy and rushed at times, but there's still a lot to enjoy about it.\n\nDeath Note chronicles the tale of Light (Nat Wolff), a high schooler who comes into the possession of a book that has the power to kill whoever's name is written within its pages. This is made possible by a shadowy deity named Ryuk (Willem Dafoe) who makes the holder of the death note's wishes come to fruition. After vowing to use the book for good (only killing those who have wronged people,) things become complicated for Light when he introduces the death note to love interest Mia (Margaret Qualley) and later when insomniac-by-choice and creepy detective 'L' (Keith Stanfield) mounts an investigation to find Light.\n\nHaving only seen a single episode of the anime, it's hard to tell what has been changed or skimmed over during the creation of this film. What is evident is how much of the source material Adam Wingard and the writers have covered in such a short timeframe. This leads to the film never really having time to breathe, we're introduced to ideas then expected to buy into them when we don't really have the screen time necessary to fully believe everything we're seeing. Not that this is a terrible creative choice, if not for this decision then the end product may have ended up rather boring, and if anything Death Note is FAR from boring throughout. \nwd_091_0100_comp_v003.1112.jpg\nFor starters, it's great to see Willem Dafoe in a role so reminiscent of his turn as the green goblin back in the early 2000's. He's as scheming and menacing as ever in the role of Ryuk, a character whose true intentions you're never really sure of. As a literal god of death, he gets his kicks out of seeing people bite the dust in brutal and horrific ways. He's a kid in a toy store and Dafoe captures this feeling perfectly, down to every spine chilling cackle of laughter.\n\nNat Wolff is also great and really sells how a teenager would respond to being gifted this type of power. A lot of his role in this film boils down to reacting to horrible and terrifying events, early in the film when he first meets Ryuk he shrieks and cries for help in a way that manages to be both utterly ridiculous and hilarious but still believable for a guy in his situation. Light is inherently a good person, he knows that taking a life is a terrible thing to do, no matter what that person has done in their past. Even as he goes further down the rabbit hole and starts to warm to the idea of deciding who lives and who dies you can tell that he's enduring a mental battle over whether he should just stop what he's doing and go back to the way things were. This is shown effectively through his relationship with his father, played brilliantly by Shea Whigham (who you'll remember from his comical role in Kong: Skull Island earlier this year, a franchise Adam Wingard will soon be all too familiar with). The two of them have a strong bond which has been solidified through grief in their past, leading to some powerful moments towards the second and third act.\ndeath-note-trailer.jpg\nDeath Note is like watching two seperate films. The first is a Final Destination-like horror that throws plenty of gruesome and satisfying deaths your way. The second is more of a cat-and-mouse detective thriller with plenty of payoff towards the finale. the two halves compliment each other well, the gore towards the start of the film works to introduce us to the concept of the death note and show that it's not a game which makes the second half of the film much more engaging when the stakes are raised after the introduction of Stanfield's jumpy and frantic detective. The downside to this is that it can often feel very rushed, relationships are developed and situations are escalated within the space of a couple of scenes so that the film can cover more ground, forcing you to adjust quickly in order to keep up. Thankfully Death Note's plot is rather simple and a lot of the complicated rules of the narrative are spelled out in a way that doesn't feel like you're being treated as an idiot.\n\nNot everything is a retread of the source material though, Margaret Qualley's Mia is a new addition who is actually pretty important to the story. She becomes involved with Light as the two become more and more obsessed with the possibilities that the death note presents. As the film progresses, a lot of her actions come off as frustrating and careless. Qualley is convincing in the role though, showing us how another may approach the idea of ruling over the lives of others.\n\nDeath Note's climax is a satisfying one, full of payoffs and unpredictable choices. When the film ended I was pleasantly surprised, the closing shots hint at the potential for more to come - which, although annoying in its ambiguity, does a good job of making you want to see what happens next. Avid fans of the source material may be disappointed with the creative liberties that were taken, but as a somewhat newcomer to the world of Death Note this is a competent and enjoyable addition to Netflix's ever-growing catalogue.",

High school student, Light Turner, (Wolff) comes across a notebook with the ability to kill anybody whose name he writes in it. He starts a crusade to kill criminals, and essentially act like a god. However, a famous detective known only as L (Stanfield) has set out to stop him.\n\nReview: I have watched very few anime in their entirety, but Death Note is one of them, and one that I can say that I am a fan of. So, I was interested in seeing the Netflix live action movie version of it, and very disappointed in the result.\nThe movie uses the same premise, but sets it in Seattle, and uses a different story. It also amplifies the blood and gore to the point where certain deaths resembled the overly complicated accidents in the Final Destination movies. There's also a half-assed love story after Light shows the Death Note to a girl he just met, and draws her into his crusade. Also, Willem Dafoe is in there as the death god, Ryuk, but he doesn't really do much.\nBut the transition to film rarely captures what made the source material great. The anime was an intriguing battle of wits between two cool, calm people (Light and L). The movie focuses very little on L's hunt for the killer, opting instead to just show Light killing people in gruesome ways, and his relationship with his girlfriend.\nAlso, the portrayals of the characters are sure to anger fans of the source material. The calm and intelligent Light is now an angsty teenager, who stupidly shows the Death Note to a girl he just met, and his immorality has been toned down significantly. L and Ryuk are portrayed decently for the most part, but it's not enough to save the movie, especially when Dafoe is so underused.\nIt may be more watchable as a standalone film, but even then, it's still not very good. It's still a dumb movie about an uninteresting teen with an over abundance of gore. There are several scenes I can point to that even non-fans would hate. Like Light's borderline comical overacting when he first sees Willem Dafoe. Or the fact that a rock ballad plays over part of the climax. As cliche as it sounds, you should watch the anime instead.\nAnd no, there are no potato chips in the movie.\n\nJaythemovieguy.blogspot.com",

In the anime \"L\" is known to be a logical thinker and have no emotional ties yet in this movie he is an emotional train wreck. \"Light\".... he was even worse intellectually, and running around like a pussy. I am disappointed.... this cat and mouse game did not live up to expectations. Save your brain cells from drowning in this stupidity.",

Light is a pussy/stupid/ignorant kid instead of a genius with grand aspirations. This was a bad movie that should have been a short mini series with sufficient time to develop and stay close to the source material or should have been a totally new idea with a different name. The writers seemed to have heard a synopsis of the manga/anime from somebody else and then wrote a script without reading the original source. This story has NOTHING in common with the manga/anime. This movie could have been a totally different story with a new wielder of the death note.

            "content": "Okay, I've never written a review for a movie before, but I'm doing it for the first time here because I hated this movie THAT MUCH. Keep in mind, for all of you who haven't watched the original Death Note series, this review will be laden with spoilers. Proceed with caution.\n\nNow, I want to make it very clear that I understand how impossible it is to put an entire series into one movie. Most times, I don't mind artistic liberties taken or scenes removed to make the movie feature film-friendly, because copying something scene by scene just doesn't work for a movie adaptation. However, I would expect that the very basics of a plot are kept, and that the overall themes and mood are kept intact. This was NOT done in this film. This showed just... a blatant disregard and disrespect for the source material. It was like they simply took a name that people love just for the sake of having it. They didn't pay any respect AT ALL. Let me explain.\n\nFirst things first: Plot. Again, I understand taking artistic liberties in order to keep pacing suitable for a feature-length film. However, this film kept nothing. I can't even make comparisons because literally nothing even remotely matched up. They only kept the main cast of characters (sort of) and the mere presence of the Death Note. The RULES in the Death Note weren't even the same. Not a single character acted like their original counterpart. I'm not blaming actors for this at all, because I can't really complain about the acting. That was entirely the script's fault. Shame on you, scriptwriters. If any of you have seen the original series and then watched this botched piece of work, you'll know what I'm talking about. From the story, to Light's economic status, to the the very existence of his mother, EVERYTHING is wrong. A story has three parts: rising action, climax, resolution. Not a single one of these was the same. You would think a live-action reboot would have those, AT LEAST. Consider Disney's live-action reboots. Extremely unnecessary, nobody really asked for them, but at least they had the basics of the story down! At least they, like, watched the original and made an attempt to recreate it respectfully. They take artistic liberties, add new songs, change some details, BUT AT LEAST THE STORY IS GENERALLY INTACT.\n\nNext: Theme. The original series was meant to create a gray area between the roles of \"protagonist\" and \"antagonist\". It was meant to make you question whether you were rooting for Light or L, and make you sympathize with both of them for different reasons. There was no clear \"good guy\" or \"bad guy\", and that's what makes the show so interesting to its fans. Light Yagami was a straight-A honors student with a clean record, on his way to becoming an upstanding member of society. His downfall was the introduction of the Death Note. No, it wasn't Ryuk, as this film makes it out to me. In the original, Ryuk was a neutral party. He was an observer. He was simply the delivery method for Light's downfall. It was Light who fell into the temptation and took those steps in the direction of a serial killer. He had a god complex and took it upon himself to create a new world free of crime, thus becoming a criminal himself in the process. In the series, this was a clear parallel to the biblical story of Lucifer. It was basically spelled out for you in the ep opening. The apples that Ryuk loved were a parallel to the forbidden fruit, a symbol of temptation, and then a symbol for the Death Note itself. This series set out to make you actually consider the concept of mass-killing criminals for the greater good. This film totally destroyed those themes of grayed morals and home-brewed destruction. It turned Light into a victim of circumstance rather than a totally self-aware genius with a god complex, thus rendering the original major theme that made the series SO WIDELY LOVED completely useless. You were forced into seeing the concept of mass-killing criminals as evil, rather than legitimately considering it and then seeing that it will ultimately only lead to more destruction in the end. You don't get to think. You don't get to consider alternatives. You don't get to think through Lights' and L's schemes and work through how brilliant both of them are. This film had so many other aspects that just... didn't survive this remake. The close rivalry between Light and L that went above a simple state of enemies. The total control that both Light and L had over their own plans. (This one just withered and died. Light was only shown as a genius in mention. The ONLY time he showed it was in the very final scene. And L was just... disappointing.) I could go on about this for a few more paragraphs AT LEAST but I'm gonna stop here.\n\nNext: Mood. This one is a little more excusable as compared to the other things but I'm gonna complain about it anyway. The original series' mood was one of the things that made me really fall in love with it. With a mix of color choice, unmistakable art style, and music, it was a perfect combination of sterile calculated mindgames and intense dramatic action. The juxtaposition made everything so complimentary, so everything was that much more impactful. The film was just grunge over drama over brooding over action over more drama. I felt suffocated by the sheer amount of edgy gore-fest romance death montage. Plus, the religious symbolism and mind games of the show really made the mood. It was a show that forced you to think and follow along. It wasn't something you could mindlessly watch. \n\nSo, in short, this film is just... a disappointment. As a standalone film, sure, MAYBE it deserves it's 40-ish percent rating from critics. I, however, find this to be very generous. In fact, I find 20% rather generous, because as a reboot, it fails completely. If you had given my father a synopsis of the original plot and told him to make a movie from it, he could have made something worthy of that 40%. And my father is a total IDIOT.\n\nTLDR; this movie sucks.",

Ryuk is a god who loves killing (doesn't make sense with any pov on Death Gods) Mia goes from Strong to stupid, to being the Kira you want, to in love, to stupid again (not character devellopement, just use or be used, nice!) light's father is basically useless (even if well portraied by Shea Whigham)\n\nIn the end, to the ones saying \"it's aimed at teenagers so who cares\" I say everyone should, the movie has no purpose, bad rythm, mostly passable acting (I'm being nice) you don't get where it wants to bring you. No real meaning... To summurise, it is a bad movie thinking audience don't deserve a real story and is probably too stupid to understand anything beyond what's shown. It's basically a teenage movie on Final destination's level, adapted from a thriller trying to make you think about the Justice system which was far better than taking you, the audience, for the dumb people we probably are (looking at what's working now).\n\nWatch the anime, watch the japanese movies (not the best but at least trying) forget this movie. ANd it sucks because Death Note, if understood, is probably easier to adapt than eg All You Need is Kill (Edge of tomorrow) but still fails to be something worth watching even if you never read or saw the original.",

Despite this, I know my fair share of the plot to notice what the Netflix film misses.\n\nUnsurprisingly, for cramming so much of the anime's story into 1 hour and 40 minutes, it's fairly fast-paced. Unfortunately, in doing so, it misses plenty of plot parts and characters, as The Last Airbender (2010) once had, changes the attitudes of present characters (yes, looks too, but those don't necessarily matter to me here, not even L being black-he at least maintains most of L's calmness and intellect), and in the end, changes at least a bit of the tone, if not more.\n\nUnlike the anime, this is rated TV-MA. What seems to make this more mature-rated than the anime is simply adding more gore, more profanities, and more sexuality... none of which I have ever seen in the anime.\n\nIn all ado, the only points I find they got right here was the basic concept of the Death Note (although even as a fan of the anime, I notice some people may be confused due to seeming lack of explanation), Ryuk (yup, he was almost perfect), L ( wasn't obscure enough  and until he got overly aggressive), and only a smidgen of the dark tone.\n\nTo conclude, this was a disappointing watch and move for Netflix again... and I am more excited now to finish the anime before month's end (as well as Fullmetal Alchemist too)!",
