Under the guidance of the pensive veteran warrior, Lord Yupa, Nausica\u00e4 works to bring peace back to the ravaged planet.",

            "content": "As dirty, cruel, forest-cutting, oil-burning, roadkill-making monsters, we don't deserve this film. Nausica\u00e4 is a champion of nature the likes we rarely see in fiction or reality. The animation is stellar, the characters are phenomenal, and the the premise transcends words. The world would be a utopia of life, peace, and happiness if everyone had even one tenth the compassion Nausica\u00e4 has for the planet and all of Mother Earth's daughters and sons big and small alike.",

            "content": "I thought the movie like most Studio Ghibli had a cool premise but so boring in execution. the movie either over-explains things or just doesn't explain things at all. The main character was insufferable at times and is the only one who is smart or capable. the movie spoils the ending in the first 15 because of its painfully obvious foreshadowing. It's bad storytelling when you say that there is going to be someone that wears blue and will save us AND YOUR MAIN CHARACTER WEARS BLUE THE WHOLE TIME.",

At times it felt like the movie and its characters didn't take their situation seriously enough which ruined some of my suspension disbelief. However, I feel like this is a common aspect in most anime so I am trying to not to fault it too much.",

I enjoyed the individual ingredients (incredibly detailed animation, strong female protagonist, the score) but I can't say I was particularly moved when taking it in as a whole. My favorite parts were the glider scenes and picking out which voice actors I recognized in the Disney dub.",
