    "summary": "The Grimm fairy tale gets a Technicolor treatment in Disney's first animated feature. Jealous of Snow White's beauty, the wicked queen orders the murder of her innocent stepdaughter, but later discovers that Snow White is still alive and hiding in a cottage with seven friendly little miners. Disguising herself as a hag, the queen brings a poisoned apple to Snow White, who falls into a death-like sleep that can be broken only by a kiss from the prince.",

SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was one of those stories, and since then, it has become a legendary work of art that continues to inspire every generation of movie goers around the world. I am truly blessed to watch this movie over and over again. It has so much love and so much happiness it just makes you want to cry every time you watch it.",

Despite that, this movie has some major problems, but again it can partially be looked past for the first animated film ever. One, it can be very boring and has a lot of filler, which can be very hard to watch sometimes. For example, the seven dwarfs take 12 minutes out of the film to wash themselves for food. Ummmm I don't want to see that in a film. The Evil Queen is kind of a boring villain, and before the seven dwarfs show up, the movie is kind of unbearable. That and Snow White the character is a little boring and Grumpy is annoying, but that's more for the times, I can look past that. Another kind of problem is that this movie is kind of only drive by emotion. Like there's really no logic here, and I don't mind that for a good stretch of a movie, but not the entire thing. With all it that said, this movie has some really good things in it. The animation is stellar, especially for the time (I believe that the movie came out in 1937, and that's crazy to think about). The fairytale that they chose is nice and the story is told well enough. This movie has a lot of creepy imagery, the highlights being the forest and the queens transformation to the witch. The best thing in this movie is the seven dwarfs, and that's a lot more fun to watch then Snow White cleaning\u2026.So, I guess this is a movie that I more respect then I actually like, but with the combination of the respect I have for it and the things I do like about it, it did just enough to call it a good film, at least for me. I would say watch it, but let's face it, you've already have. But I would say rewatch this true groundbreaker of a film, you won't regret it!",

It technically wasn't the first animated feature made (though it *was* the first feature length traditionally animated film), but it showed that it was possible for a cartoon to do more than simply make someone laugh, and showed that animation was truly an art form in its own right. Snow White was the first of what is now known as the Disney Animated Features canon, and was the cornerstone of the animated empire that would be created in its wake. A massive critical and commercial success at the time of its release, adjusted for inflation Snow White remains the highest grossing animated film of all time, and one of the highest grossing films in history.\n\nThe film itself, however, has not quite aged as well as its indisputable influence. Though the film is certainly beautiful, and certainly no expense was spared on its visuals, which were unparalleled for the time (save perhaps by the Fleischer studios), the animation is somewhat crude at times, and small errors can be seen here and there. The story itself is fairly loose, as the film feels more like an overlong Silly Symphony, rather than a coherent film. However, there's no denying that the film does get you to truly feel for its title character, and the character evolution of Grumpy was unlike anything seen in a cartoon at the time.

Now, that doesn't mean it's bad, the animation's stunning, same for the visuals, and some of the characters were good, but what I thought were the first 40 minutes of the film, only turned out to be just 15 minutes. The pacing feels EXTREMELY Slow, and for an hour and a half-long film, it felt like it was 3 hours long instead. And another thing that I'd like to pinpoint is that the ending was a bit... Meh. The prince arrives, and kisses Snow White, The End. Come on, it'd be more interesting for him to at least fight the Evil Queen. A little more screen time wouldn't hurt... That being said, the film's slow pacing is the thing that bothers me the most. But given the excuse that this was Disney's first ever animated film, I'll forgive them that.",

David Hand's direction is remarkable as he delightfully takes us from one pleasant encounter to another with a blissful, naive, Summer day vibe to Snow White. Everything is bright and cheerful like the vibrant soft pastel color palette for Snow White. \n\nI like the quaint production design. All the lush greens, pops of red, and dousings of blue are still beautiful to behold. Hand has a unique vision for Snow White to feel like a German folk tale like the Brothers Grimm fairytale it was based on originally. The Germanic influence from Virginia Lockwood's costume designs to the traditional yodeling music is apparent and appreciated. Snow White just simply looks great, especially when you compare it to the animated features at the time. The animation is fluid and soft with tons of moving animals and characters all on top of gorgeous background art. You cannot beat hand drawn animation as Snow White still looks stunning 80 years later.\n\nPaul J. Smith, Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline's score is fantastic for Snow White. All the songs are so memorable and catchy that by the end of them, you are singing along. The characters are very likable with the silly dwarfs with their seven distinct personalities: Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful, and Dopey. It's incredible how Disney changed how we see animated films as family movies with a single blow of 83 entertaining minutes of Snow White hanging out with her 7 new friends. Bill Melendez' editing is swift and surreal like you are watching someone else's dream play out. His soft cuts and fade out edits are really neat to see. \n\nAdriana Caselotti's iconic soft voice for Snow White is very fun and innocent. She's playful with the dwarfs and has a distinct high pitch that I hope you don't find irritating because she's clearly having a lot of fun with her lead role. Likewise, Lucille La Verne is killer as The Evil Queen and Witch. Her iconic disgust for Snow White is very entertaining. Moroni Olsen is excellent as the blunt Magic Mirror. His deep voice is so engaging and mysterious. He adds a layer of whimsy and mystery to Snow White that I always liked. The entire cast of dwarfs is fun, especially Pinto Colvig as Grumpy and Sleepy. Roy Atwell's stuttering and kind Doc is wonderful. Otis Harlan is such a joyous Happy. Scotty Mattraw is an adorable Bashful. Billy Gilbert goes all out as the loud Sneezy. Eddie Collins is fun as Dopey. Harry Stockwell is solid as the prince with the fun musicals numbers mostly going to the dwarfs.\n\nIn all, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs makes you want to go on a fantasy adventure to find your true love, even if you only meet them for a magical moment!",

But it also stands tall on its own merits, from the bold, unforgettable character designs to the lasting, catchy musical interludes. I'm not sure the studio has ever matched this soundtrack, actually, both in terms of staying power and sheer sing-along-ability.\n\nA few unsightly seams might show - clumsy little tricks to avoid the difficult camera angles and puzzling plot machinations to trim troublesome characters (which explains why the charming prince disappears for most of the film) - but animators were literally flying by the seat of their pants here, experimenting on-stage to test the viability of their chosen medium. I could nitpick about a whole lot of small items, but in a broad sense, it's the rare film that can still easily captivate a willing audience after eighty-plus years in the can. That alone is an incredible testament to the dedication, tenacity and enduring skill of the whole team, and the quality of the finished product.

At a time when animation was tedious and time-consuming, to cobble together an 83-minute film that looks this good is astounding. I also love the music in this film, because it constantly gets stuck in my head (even though Adriana Caselotti\u2019s voice as Snow White can be a little ear-piercing.) I think where this movie always underwhelms me is the story. There aren\u2019t strong character motivations for most of the things that people do in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and none of the characters are developed in any fashion. In fact, they spend more time on the dwarfs goofing off than on any backstory for Snow White or the dwarfs themselves. Sure, there are some funny things in all that singing and playing around, but I could see a better use for the screen-time. The plot is what became the clich\u00e9 of classic Disney princess films. Of course, Snow White gets a little extra credit for doing it first and setting the standard for what would come out of Disney animation for decades. I simply do not get much enjoyment from watching these bland love-at-first-sight tales with 2-dimensional characters. It seems that Disney recognizes this is not a great trope they pulled from classic fairy tales, because they are clearly determined to abolish it nowadays. That doesn\u2019t mean this film is unpleasant or hard to watch, though. I can see why Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has stood the test of time, and could still be watched by children in the 2020s and be just as entertaining. It\u2019s a well-constructed film with humor, romance, and a little horror. I just find, as I\u2019ve grown up, I desire a bit more to get full enjoyment from my childhood favorites.",

I still have massive respect for those who created this though, obviously.\n\nThe voice cast, as was usual in the early decades of Disney, are a little forgettable. Adriana Caselotti (White) and Lucille La Verne (Queen) do fine jobs, though it's Pinto Colvig who is most memorable as Grumpy.\n\nThe premise is a pretty light too, with the main saviour hardly featuring and the antagonist disappearing for relatively large portions.

The dwarfs are one of the strongest parts of the film. While I love all of them and they're all drawn so distinctively(which I get credit given they are all the same height and have similar clothing patterns), there is one dwarf I feel does not get enough screentime: Sleepy. His lines are only once in awhile in the film, and I feel he deserved as much attention. Then again, what can a character say when he's asleep most of the time. The emotion has really been pushed high in this one for me, which is the other thing I find incredibly strong in this movie. If there's one Disney film that can make me cry, it's the last five minutes of the movie. Not any other Disney film besides Old Yeller and Snow White have made me cry. The scene where the dwarfs are gathered around lifeless Snow White and the depressed drawing expressions on them is something I'll never forget. The Prince does not have an interesting character, but he does have a great singing voice. The Queen is not one of the best Disney villains, nor does she have a lot of character, but that immediately changes when she turns into an old witch. At that point, it really grabbed my interest, and I was amazed at how well they made her character quite menacing and disturbing. That's a well-drawn character I would not want to come across in real life. There's that softness given to the character's coloring in animation that makes them look very lively and believable. While I do think they could have drawn the faces of the normal humans better, I still can't imagine Snow White being 14 and more of 16 or 17 instead. They make up for this though with the animation on the dwarfs, which, by the way, I love the animation on Grumpy. I admire how they all have different walks, and Grumpy's walk(along with Dopey's) are memorably distinctive. That small chewing animation on Grumpy when he walks with irritation is a small touch of detail that makes me understand the character he is without having to even listen to him talk. Some of the scenes that are personal favorites are from when the hunter is getting ready to try and kill Snow White, but fails, all the way to the end of her running through the forest. Suspense is strong in the film, and it's really helped by the dark shadows and grim detail in the animal and tree animation in the forest. The score also helps with the tone of a situation, and it's especially strong with those suspenseful, dramatic scenes. Speaking of the score, the songs are great, even though I do think a couple of them like the washing song and dwarf dance song go on a bit too long. It also amazes me to think that the voice actor of Happy, Otis Harlan, may have the record for the oldest actor that ever worked for Disney. A great classic, not one of my favorites(in fact, I don't put in my top 10 favorite Disney films), but it's still emotionally and dramatically pleasing with some lovable personalities and a strong score.\n\n3.5/4",

            "content": "Back before Disney Animation Studios was creating offensive Jewish wolfs and propaganda against Germany, their first major picture was a commendable achievement in cinematic animation history. Because it was the first, set standards, and raked in that good good money.\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarves officially marks the first instance in which the overtly cartoonish style they were known for in shorts became mixed with more realistic models that seemed to move and act on an entirely different plane. That is to say they did. They were animated apart from the other subjects and painted onto different cels, and it holds up as well as Dopey and Sneezy in a trenchcoat. This creates my biggest gripe with Disney's feature films, being an inconsistant artstyle that only creates visual turmoil onscreen. This is where it began, and since this was the start of many successful films following it, this is why it mostly didn't stop.\n\nThe first wave feminist angle has done this movie in easily, but an angle that I'm not sure has been realized as well is the religious one. It's barely there but it does come out in the writing, and creates an entirely different perspective on why this film isn't something I would want to show my hypothetical daughters.\n\nOnly one small scene shows it. After the dwarves fight over a pillow downstairs, Snow White is seen and heard praying upstairs to the night sky (this was before the star). She feels \"blessed\" for the kindness of the dwarves and \"prays\" for the realization of her romantic wishes, \"amen\". The dialogue is probably written without a thought in mind as popular America was and is overtly Christian. \n\nWhat follows right after is the temptation of the apple. What occurred before was a princess basically mothering a bunch of old men in a polite and proper fashion, undertaking the tasks of a housewife and being an all around flawless kind girl. Snow White is written as the perfect Madonna, and the minute she gives into a bit of her own desire, elements of the Eve story are impossible to ignore.\n\nIt is only her remaining beauty (two seasons of avoiding decay and somehow not losing the blush in her cheeks after her blood congeals and her pulse stops) that saves her in the end and allows her wishes to be granted. Of course her actions beforehand were accompaniment to her beauty, and it acts as the other male characters' memory of her, but in a story of competition between two women on how good they look it's obvious that the simple fairy tale just doesn't translate well when given Christian overtones. The original fairy tale has stronger comparisons to Roman mythology and the tale of Mercury, Apollo, and Chione.\n\nEspecially now when Disney (both man and studio)'s faults have been mostly realized, they only succeed in making the film more uncomfortable and bumpy to watch. The relationship of Snow White and the dwarves teeters on motherly love and their own attractions, Grumpy's sexism is extremely off putting and only serves to strengthen the film's own messages of a Madonna/Eve duality, and the \"slave\" in the magic mirror is modeled with common (though subtle) cartoon facial tropes of black men.\n\nThe main factors that have aged well are the senses of extremities in emotion during those scenes dedicated to it. Snow White surrounded by terrifying green eyes in the forest is fantastic emphasis on the realization of her murderous stepmother, the Queen's spell brewing and transformation sequences create great atmosphere, and even a couple of the dwarves' scenes devoted to padding are effective like the silly song or Snow White's story of romance. The rest of the padding is unfortunately quite sleep inducing (a VERY bad thing for this film especially), and it takes up dozens of minutes. This is a half-hour film stretched out to feature length.\n\nThe songs, now that I think about it, are quite underwhelming. It's only because they've existed for about a hundred years that we all remember them. And since Disney has had so much practice with animating charming things and making a happy atmosphere, those types of scenes come and go without much impact anymore.\n\nSnow White is emotionally sound and an impressive start to cinematic animation. The thematics are far too simplistic for us to really get into, and a bit too flawed and outdated for kids nowadays. It's a classic that is easy to praise, but only to a certain point. Although no other major ones exist, this adaptation of the German fairy tale certainly isn't fairest in the land.",

Snow White is the embodiment of girlish sweetness and kindness, exemplified in her love for the birds and the small animals of the woods. Like most other Disney princesses such as Cinderella and Belle, Snow White is just another young princess with red lips, white skin, a skinny body, and a beautiful face. Even the magic mirror describes her as the girl with \"lips red as the rose, hair black as ebony, [and] skin white as snow\". From the very beginning, there's a huge emphasis put on Snow White's beauty. She's the \"fairest\" of the land. In other words, she's the prettiest. Not only is she pretty, though. She cooks and cleans too! In Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Disney created a stereotypical depiction of how they think women should behave. A good children's movie doesn't portray women in such a biased way. And since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a children's movie, I simply can't endorse it.\nThroughout the film, Snow White is really only a plot point. She doesn't think for herself. She doesn't really do anything. Well, I guess that's not true. She embodies the image of a perfect woman. For instance as soon as Snow White enters the little house in the middle of the forest she criticizes the fact that the people who love in it are untidy and dirty. She decides to clean up the house without even knowing who lives in it. And cleaning the house was actually a pleasant activity for her. She loved it! This film influences girls to believe that they too should too clean. Unbelievable.Also, throughout the entire movie, all Snow White does is think about her handsome prince whom she will marry one day.  But how many times does he appear in the film? He only appears twice. He's seen in the beginning and the end of the movie. Yet as the story goes, the prince ends up being the one who saves the day. He rescues Snow White from her apparent death. Snow White was rescued by her prince and therefore entered his life instead of creating her own. \nAs a mother of two little girls, I personally believe that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs would be a terrible influence on my daughters. I wouldn't allow for them to watch it. I professionally believe that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs misses the most important element that every children's movie should have: a good lesson. For that reason, I give this film a very poor rating.\nSave your children from being brainwashed, don't let them watch this film.",

I can name a plethora of reasons why I love this movie. The animation is beautiful, with one or two stiff movements, but have a heart, it is the first Disney animation. The songs are mind-blowing, as well as the gorgeous incidental music(music similar to Great Expectations, 1946) that hardly anybody has mentioned. My favourite is \"Someday my Prince Will Come\", I cry every time I hear it. The characters are legendary, and the writing is top notch. Who can forget those adorable dwarfs, who added such a lot to this movie. Snow White is the weakest character but I like her innocence very much, and about her singing voice...it sounds weak, but in real life it must have been strong, and let me explain why. The colouratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci was given the praise \"a beautiful and limpid voice\" yet I heard it on cassette and it sounds quite quiet. It has nothing to do with the size of the voice, but the quality of the recording. The best character was the wicked queen, who had the most classic animation scene I have ever seen... when she turns into a hag, which freaked me out big time when I was about 9, like Malificent from \"Sleeping Beauty.\" To me the Queen is probably one of the scariest Disney villains ever. The scene at Snow White's coffin was heart-rending, and it was the music that made it so. All in all, a beautiful, funny and touching movie, and I can't believe some people hated this. 10/10.

When sent to her execution in the forest, the tasked huntsman cannot perform the deed, so she retreats to the woods to seek shelter with seven dwarfs, living in the middle of nowhere.  If you ever have the chance to go to either Disney World or Disneyland, it isn't hard to get inspired to go back and revisit some of these relics from the past.  Having just rode the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train on my honeymoon, my wife and I (gotta fully adjust from referring to her as my fianc\u00e9) decided to sit down this month and watch the very first Disney movie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  Sure, there are elements to it that are dated, but this is still an achievement for the medium, especially when you consider that this got released in 1937.  This may just be the most influential animated movie of all time.  It paved the way for so many animated films, all of which owe a tip of their hat to this one here.  The family market is a lucrative demographic, and if you win them over, they will come back multiple times over, even if it means buying an updated, higher resolution package to products they already own whenever the vault gets opened.  With this film there is just so much craft to it that is readily visible, and you can easily tell just how much time and effort went into this; between the art and the design, Snow White is always a visual treat.  Now I will say that some of the songs don't hold up; there are a couple of numbers that Snow White has toward the beginning that I had forgotten even existed.  But there are two songs prominently featured here that are instant classics in \"Whistle While You Work\", and \"Heigh-Ho\".  Even though Doc is essentially Happy with spectacles, the character designs are very successful in giving everyone a whole lot of personality in a very brief amount of time.  From a storytelling standpoint, I have a couple of issues, namely that Prince Charming is kind of worthless; he's in the film for maybe 4 minutes, and he gets still gets to claim all the glory of being the man that comes to the rescue at the end?  Clearly, a sign of the times.  Also, the evil queen vs. Snow White storyline is the most compelling angle, but we spend the majority of our time in this cabin with these dwarfs; this is obviously to make it more family friendly, as all of these guys are wholly lovable, and I completely understand that.  All of that said, making criticisms against this feels completely like nitpicking, given what a firmly cemented classic this is.",
