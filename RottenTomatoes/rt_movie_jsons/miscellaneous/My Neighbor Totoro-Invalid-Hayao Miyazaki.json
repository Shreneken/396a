There are so many wonderful things about My Neighbour Totoro. It is very simple in story and character but it is all very beautiful, charming and touching. The animation is typical Ghibli, ethereal-looking and just ravishing to watch, while the music is one of my favourite scores in a Ghibli film. The story is simple, but I loved the simplicity, it had such a pleasant atmosphere to it, and the characters are engaging with great chemistry together. I have very little to complain about the voice acting either, everybody did a fine job. In conclusion, in my opinion this is an animated classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

You can see the chemistry between the sisters as well which is helped since they are voiced by Dakota and Elle Fanning. It is stuns me how accurate the depiction of children is in this film. From their curious nature to their actions in the face of struggle, it honestly feels like children are real and not played up to be a spectacle of cinema. The music is very simple yet beautiful which is very reflective of the narrative as well. The namesake of the film, Totoro, introduces the children to the cute and quirky spirits of the world. It can be said that he was merely a vessel of their childlike wonder and care for each other as a family. The ending is the only issue I can find with the film simply because it wasn't put in as a major plot point until the final third of the film.",

            "content": "The legacy of the beloved titular character, Totoro (Frank Welker), outshines the rest of the Studio Ghibli film. Watching the film in 2021, I caught myself waiting, scene after scene, for the Snorlax-like creature to return to the screen and take me away into a land of wonder and amazement. However, much of the film centers on two sisters, Satsuki (Dakota Fanning) and Mei (Elle Fanning), whose family has recently moved out of the city and into the countryside. Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli in general are masters at capturing those difficult-to-describe moments of childhood. Here, the excitement of moving to a new house ‚Äî a house which, everyone in the family hopes, is haunted. Of course, it wouldn't be a Miyazaki story about those formidable years of youth if a child's imagination wasn't involved. Only Satsuki and Mei can see Totoro, the other miniature.. uh‚Ä¶ Totoros(?), ‚Äî What is a Totoro, anyway? ‚Äî and the cat-bus (my personal favorite character), while their father (Tim Daly) and the other townsfolk cannot. The only conflict concerns their sick mother (Lea Salonga), who is bedridden in a hospital, and a sudden message on the state of her affliction. The animation was so impressive that my co-viewer (and fianc√©e) didn't believe that it was made in 1988 ‚Äî I told her she needs to watch Akira ‚Äî most notably, the translucent mini-Tots. The bus-stop scene (the one that adorns the cover/poster) is worth the price of admission alone, and I'm surprised it wasn't some stand-alone short from which the full-feature had sprouted. I can see this film appealing much more to children than adults ‚Äî I don't always feel that way about Disney/Pixar films anymore ‚Äî which is who the film is made for, anyway. It's a tame adventure, for Ghibli standards, and offers a sibling story that won't rip your heart out ‚Äî I'm looking at you, Grave of the Fireflies. While Totoro outshines the story as a whole ‚Äî a new line of Totoro-inspired handbags is what made my co-viewer want to watch the movie.. ‚Äî it's still a fun ride without any of the depressing stuff \"children's\" movies seem to require nowadays.",

The very sort of innocence only children can truly grasp, until they forsake it in the name of growing up and becoming cynical.\nBut do not be confused, the most remarkable thing about this movie is, precisely, that it refuses that well known trope, so abused by other studios and storytellers: the adults portrayed in this masterfully animated piece of art aren't cynical; their kindness knows no limits, their humbleness allows them to admit there's a whole world out there that cannot be perceived by their eyes, and their honest amazement and embracing of the sheer innocence of their kids can make anyone wish they had grown up in such a place.\nStructure wise, this film is longer than one would expect it to be. However, that is precisely the point. Miyazaki knows his craft, so he lets every situation to develop, so the viewer can not only perceive the point of view of each character, but, also, to interact with their own evoked emotions, to be a part of the story. \nThe filmmaker achieves this by complementing such masterful storytelling with a breathtaking cinematography. This movie is gorgeous, vibrant and filled with panoramic shots that make you want to be in that small post war Japanese Town. \nIn the end, this movie is one of the very few that can, and will, make you feel happy for no reason. \nAll you need to do to achieve that, is to let go of your cynicism, to be another of the adults of the story. \n\nOh, and, please, watch it in Japanese.",

Miyazaki's direction captures the innocence and simplicity of childhood. These two sisters move to a new home and just entertain themselves with a few adorable surprises along the way with no conflicts. Joe Hisaishi's score is my favorite aspect of My Neighbor Totoro as his tender synth and piano heavy symphony casts a warm blanket over this gentle picture. Hisaishi's soundtrack is phenomenally well composed as he fits the bright and playful tone of Totoro.\n\nMiyazaki's writing is sweet and dreamy as he lets you identify with two adolescent girls having fun and worrying about their sick mother in the hospital. It's very pleasant and realistic with a wonderful fantasy element of magical wood spirits. My Neighbor Totoro has that Summer afternoon feel with a breezy 86 minute run-time that never feels wearisome. Takeshi Seyama's editing is cut to a relaxing pace to just let you enjoy all the pretty imagery from Studio Ghibli's stellar hand drawn animation. Mark Henley and Hisao Shirai's cinematography features plenty of wide shots of the forest with lush greenery everywhere.\n\nTotoro is such an iconic figure in anime that Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli uses him as their logo. This fuzzy creature is the cuddly namesake of the movie. All the wood spirits are funny little guys that I really love. I loved Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning's voice acting for the two lead characters: Satsuki and Mei. I wish I saw My Neighbor Totoro as a boy. \n\nI think My Neighbor Totoro may be the cutest movie I've ever seen.",

When American animation decided that it no longer wanted to be the world leader in the industry and began cranking out unremarkable or explicitly bad films just to cash a check, Japan came right on their heels for the top spot, unquestionably taking the medium to new creative heights. My Neighbor Totoro is one of the great representatives of this trend, blending a wonderfully simple narrative with completely original fantasy elements and intertwining a degree of melancholy that saves the film from falling into pandering territory. This has to be the most tonally distinct dual billing in film history, being released alongside Grave of the Fireflies.

But it is so much more than that. The images and music paint a picture of the deliberate pace of life in rural farming communities before TV and smartphones. People took walks in the forest and met their neighbors. They rode bicycles through the countryside and they allowed that magic can happen when you see the world through the eyes of a four year old. There is no real conflict to be resolved here, no villain, no violence. People are generally kind to one another. Grownups are trustworthy and children trust them. It rains and people share umbrellas. This is almost a meditation for adults who watch it and for very young ones, it moves at a pace that lingers on things like tadpoles in a puddle. ",

            "content": "Movies stick with us for different reasons. Some make us cry and we feel the intense drama. Some make us laugh so hard until it hurts. Some movies can do both of them and one of those is My Neighbor Totoro. A legendary film from the great Hiro Miyazaki. When I do my list of top one hundred favorite movies of all-time, this one will be way up there.\n\nCharacters\n\nMeet Satsuki, she is a rambunctious child who lives with her father while her mother recuperates in the hospital. Mei is her younger sister who is such a sweetheart. She has so much energy and cuteness that shines through. They live near a kind lady who they name granny. The voice acting is impeccable. No one over does it and every line is delivered with perfect pitch and timing. The characters are like the ones you usually see in a Miyazaki movie, the understanding dad, the wonderful mom, and the relatable and cute kids. Does this take away from the characters? Nope, they are so real and likable, you don't even notice. They are normal people who we can relate to, and see the world through Satsuki and Mei's eyes is quite an experience. Totoro and his companions are great. They have personality and great design. You will never forget the cat bus. Yes, you heard me, a kitty cat bus! It's sooo cute you'll wish there really was a kitty cat bus! Oh the horror! Make it real!\n\nStory\n\nThe story is simple and it works. A father and his two kids move out to a small home, so they can visit their mom (his wife), more often. Mei goes into the woods and she finds a creature named Totoro. She tries to convince her sister and father that she found him, but he doesn't appear. Is this all in Mei's head? The story does deepen when mom gets sick. Satsuki and Mei try to find a way to see her see if she is ok. This is so relatable to any child. Who wouldn't want to rush to the hospital to see their mom if she was supposed to go home, but gets sick? Mei and Satsuki also try to find out what is Totoro's deal. Is he a friend? Watch and see.\n\nDirecting\n\nAs usual, Miyazaki does his typical perfect job directing the animation with vibrant colors, wonderful character design, and a smart screenplay. I love how Miyazaki makes his characters look like regular people, instead of the typical anime tropes. It makes their situations more relatable. There are quiet moments in this movie that are spectacular. Miyazaki respects the audience's intelligence. He knows we can handle quiet moments and lets us fill in the blanks on what's going on. Audiences don't need zooming cameras and in your face loudness in order to compel us. Give us a good story and characters we can relate to, and we can have the patience to watch any movie.\n\nScreenplay\n\nThe screenplay maybe my favorite part of this movie. When Mei tells her dad and Satsuki that she saw Totoro, we could've gotten the same, \"Sure you did, you are nuts.\" tropes we've seen a thousand times. Instead, we get a caring father and sister who really want this to be real for Mei. That is such a breath of fresh air to see in a family movie. The story has enough depth, but doesn't bog down the story will too much plot. Instead, the screenplay focuses on the journey for Satsuki and Mei. This is perfect! It keeps it simple and relatable without drowning out the spirit of what makes this movie so good. It is pure magic. Simple, sweet and gentle. This is one of the best screenplays for any movie, I've ever seen. Miyazaki wrote this masterwork of a screenplay and should've gotten an Oscar nomination for it.\n\nFlaws\n\nI can't really name any to be honest. Maybe the running time, which is eighty-seven minutes long. I would have loved if this movie had been four hours long! Maybe, that's the sign of a great movie. It leaves you wanting more! This is a near perfect movie that delights with sights, sounds, heartfelt moments and hearty laughs.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro has become a huge cult hit and it is easy to see why. The gorgeous visuals, adorable characters, charming story and sweet tone will make this a family favorite for decades to come. Ninety-nine percent of big Hollywood animated movies pale in comparison to this movie. If you are looking for adorable, and wholesome family entertainment that is also a great movie. Look no further than My Neighbor Totoro, one of the best movies, (not just animated, but movies period), ever made.\n\nMy Score: 4 stars. One of the best animated, no, movies PERIOD, of all time. A charming classic that you will love and watch many times without the magic wearing off.",

            "content": "I can't describe how delighted am I after I've just finished watching this movie. This is the best movie that captured the childhood very accurately. The children characters behave so realistically that I couldn't believe my eyes while watching them play, cry, laugh, or doing anything. I didn't felt like I was watching a child in front of me, but I felt like I was watching my younger self; I felt like I was watching myself as a child, or as if my childhood memories were being displayed before me. Even if I haven't done that particular thing the characters do, I somehow felt that my younger self would do the exact thing. If that means anything, it's that Hayao Miyazaki has captured The essence of childhood like now one did.\n\nBut the greatest thing about My Neighbor Totoro isn't how realistic it feels, but it's the fabulous message it delivers, and the thing that is more fascinating is the way it delivers this message. I really shouldn't spoil anything about this gorgeous film, but it delivers a message about facing the fear; the fear of everything, and the fear in all its kinds and levels. Miyazaki merged this message with the story in a gleefully brilliant way.\n\nI shouldn't call it delivering the message, though. Instead, I should call it merging or combining the message with the story, or rather I should say that Miyazaki created an entire story from a message! It's really amazing that this film has no real plot!\n\nHayao Miyazaki proved that it's not even necessary for a movie to have an antagonist, or at least not a common one, as I mentioned above, the story itself is about a message about facing the fear. And I didn't feel at any time throughout the movie that I need an antagonist or a usual problem to be invested in the movie. I was engaged and hooked from the very beginning of the movie till the end credits scene, which is very cool, by the way.\n\nThe thing is that at the third act the movie changed completely in terms of the plot; it turned from a plot-free movie to a movie that has a real plot and a very serious problem. The plot and its problem didn't come from nowhere; they are attached very well to the story from its beginning, and it's been appeared later that the plot is kinda share the same message of the story, but the problem is that the movie changed a great deal when it moved from its second to the third act. I felt as the movie betrayed itself after promising, and spectacularly managing to keep the audience on the edge of their seat with a story devoid from typical plot issues and obstacles. Yes, I've been engaged again and invested in the story with its plot because I cared about every single character, but it took me a little time, and I really felt a bit uncomfortable and annoyed with this inconsistency.\n\nOverall, I can say that My Neighbor Totoro is an imaginative tale that every parent should enjoy it with his/her child. Because I think that the moral of the story is actually as, if not more important to parents.\n\nI personally prefer My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away, but if I'm going to be honest with myself, Spirited Away is the better film; just slightly better. Looking forward to see more works from this genius filmmaker.\n\n(8.5/10)",

There was no dark twist or big crisis.\n\nThe animation was extremely well done. It's always good to see. The music was for me the highest point of this movie. It was always beautiful and mesmerizing. The story was very adequate, worked well enough. The characters were pretty much all good people. The magical elements of the movie were beautifully done, very creative.\n\nThe tone of the movie really worked for me. Felt very languid and relaxed. It felt like I was soaking up the summer. This movie was a pretty good reminder of what it's like to be a kid. Nice little nostalgia inducing movie.\n\nThey only thing that maybe disappointed me a bit was the rather flat nature of the plot progression here. All the story elements were pretty much tame, if we take everything we're shown at face value. I guess that's due to the unambitious nature of the movie. It's not out to tell a heartbreaking human drama or something of the sort, it just captures its own little tame tale. And that's fine.

            "content": "I watched \"My Neighbor Totoro.\"This movie was Japanese animation and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli in 1988. It is the very famous movie in Japan. And this is one of the popular movie in Ghibli and also loved by many generations of people.\nThis movie's main characters are \"Totoro, and it is a mysterious animal, \"Satsuki\", she is a girl who is very steady, and\"Mei\", she is younger sister of Satsuki.\nFirstly, Satsuki and Mei and their father moved to countryside for their sickly mother. In the new their house, they were surprised because suddenly \"Makkuro Kurosuke\" appeared. \"Makkuro Kurosuke\" is black dust however they has eyes and also move anywhere. It's very mysterious... However the two girls were enjoying the house. One day, Mei found a very small load while playing alone and she walked through the load. In the place that she reached, she found a very big animal that has never seen. The animal named \"Totoro\" by Mei. After that they sometimes met Totoro, and they helped by Totoro. \nI personally think the best scene of this movie is the scene that Satsuki was searching Mei. Satsuki tried to her best running to find Mei. And Totoro & Nekobus helped her and she could find Mei. I was very moved in this scene, and you will be too.\nI think the writer wants to tell you children's pure heart. This is because only children who have pure heart can see and meet Totoro. There is a phrase in the music \"Kodomo no toki ni dake anata ni otozureru fushigina deai\". This means A mysterious meeting while only you are child. I love this phrase so much and the phrase make me excited. Adults can't see Totoro. I am 19 years old yet, so I might be able to see Totoro. I really want to see Totoro. If you want to remember your pure heart, I recommend \"My neighbor Totoro.\"",

            "content": "Hayao Miyazaki is the famous movie director of Studio Ghibli and My neighbor Totoro is one of the most famous movies in Japan especially. When I watched this movie, I could feel nostalgic because the movie reminded me of hanging out with my friends during my childhood. For example, I often played with my friends in a park which is called KAIGARAYAMAKOUEN(shell mountain park) or in Tokyo when I was a child and there was some trouble. The movie of Totoro also has one big problem, so I personally think if you watch My neighbor Totoro, you can connect the movie with some your memory.\nBesides, the story is written by child's perspective so I could back to my childhood while I was watching it.\n\nTotoro also has a lot of unique expression of Ghibli. For example, the movie has beautiful green pictures and many emotions of characters. Especially, \"Wind\" is one of the most important things in Totoro because when the emotions of characters are changed by something, \"Wind\" will blow. This is my most interesting point in Totoro. I can enjoy watching the movie every time.\nSatsuki, Mei and their father moved to a farm village because of the their mother's disease. One day, when Mei played by herself, she found Totoro and she built a good relationship with Totoro and another day, Satsuki also found it. So far the story had progressed smoothly but in their summer vacation, they received a bad message about their mother from a hospital. Then Mei tried to go to the hospital by herself. I think this part was the most important section because the atmosphere of this story was changed. (of course, \"Wind\" was blowing.) Besides, as I wrote, I could remember my childhood and feel the pure heart of Mei because children usually love their mother. Incidentally, I will go to see my mother even in my case. lol\n\nIf you watch a movie of Ghibli, you can see beautiful pictures, changes in emotion of characters and so on as I wrote above but My neighbor Totoro teaches us \"What is the pure heart of children.\"This meaning is that we can just feel it but it is usually difficult for us, adults, to remember the feelings of children in our life. However, Totoro has an ability to remind us of our own childhood. So I want you to watch this movie to feel the same feeling as me. Also, children and adults can enjoy watching it together and be moved by the movie. I hope you will watch My neighbor Totoro.",

            "content": "My Neighbor Totoro is an animated movie that was produced by Hayao Miyazaki that was released in Japan during 1988 and then re-released in America during 1993. My Neighbor Totoro was released through Studio Ghibli, a company that is famous for what most would call masterpieces like Spirited Away, and Ponyo that has swayed the hearts of many through a combination of story, music, and animation. While the movie was not heavily received during release it is now considered an international phenomenon. My Neighbor Totoro is a film about two girls and their first days moving into a new house so that the girls and their father could live closer to their sick mother. It then delves into the girl's adventures of moving in and meeting their neighbors, spiritual and human. When they are first coming into the house they meet soot sprites, reminiscent of dust bunnies, but living creatures. These soot sprites are their first experience with spirits before they end up meeting three Totoros, these creatures whom are said to be guardians of the forest, as the girls go upon their day, along with a cat bus that is reminiscent of the Cheshire cat from Alice in wonderland.\n\nDespite being a Studio Ghibli film, My Neighbor Totoro is oddly different from the usual formula of using music and animation to progress a great story that can hit at the hearts of young adults. Instead, it seems like Miyazaki had designed this to hit at an emotion that was forgotten by many animators, nostalgia. This focus on nostalgia and letting the audience know that you can grow up without losing that innocent mindset causes Miyazaki to focus more on character building and world building.\nTo start it off, almost all the story is told from the point of view of children characters, and the few times that you see it from adults they talk about the situation from what they imagine as a child. By choosing this direction, Miyazaki sets the feeling of the being a child's perspective and be so tolerant of the kid's talking about spirits bringing in the idea that they can still grow up and mature without having to lose the imagination that they would have. You also have the choice of a watercolor background to be reminiscent of what we would imagine in a flashback to childhood and maybe even the magical nature that is the childhood imagination. On top of the water color background you have the music which while simple, in lyrics and sounds, lets you know exactly what mood the scene is supposed to bring in. The design of the spirits that they meet bring this in too, though one might not imagine.\n\nThe biggest complaint about this film is that critics will say that there is little to no plot in the story. While I cannot say that I disagree with this statement, I will say that having a plot like what most people expect from a Studio Ghibli film is perfect for this film. What most people tend to forget about when watching this is that this is a story of Miyazaki's past, and this story is meant to remind people of the past that one will most certainly forget about as an adult who is busy working. Forcing this movie to have a more intricate plot would backfire and be less nostalgic than the movie ended up being. The second issue that people talk about is that people think that the movie is childish, and while it is true that it is a childish piece, it is a piece that is supposed to bring out the magical nature of childhood, so this has to be expected. What these people miss is that unlike other cartoons, this is a movie that does not talk down to its adult audience, but in fact brings them in by being there.\n\nIn the end, My Neighbor Totoro is still a magical piece of Miyazaki's that will last upon the ages like that of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh. With the biggest message of this piece telling us that while we can grow up in age that we do not have to lose the innocence and love in order to do so.",

It's really cute and funny to see how the big sister looks like her mother and the little sister looks like her father.\n\nOf course, as always, the animation is wonderful and the artwork and colors are beautiful. Again, you can see in this movie, the love, respect, and fascination that Miyazaki has for nature. The creatures in this movie are really cute. The music is brilliant. It compliments what's on screen so well. Both beautiful and whimsical.\n\nBeing that the little sister is very young, and still has an active imagination and has nothing to do, I start to wonder if she's creating these creatures in her head. Kind of like what children do when their outside playing.\n\nTo see how Totoro enjoys the raindrops falling on his umbrella put a smile on my face. And then his reaction afterwards. The cat bus! Oh my god. When I saw that, that was amazing. When they made the plants grow, that was so beautiful. Almost teared up.\n\nOverall, wonderfully beautiful and meditative film about childhood and family relationships and a big bear-looking creature called Totoro. I love Miyazaki films. They have this almost magical and whimsical feel about them that no other types of movies have. They also feel nostalgic. All I know is that I will keep watching his movies again and again.",

The animations were great and Totoro and the Catbus were great creations.  They were absolutely adorable.  I would love a life-size Totoro cushion or Totoro onesie.  The music in my Neighbour Totoro was also great.  I was just a little sad that this film was as short as it was.  Totoro is such a great character that it would have been nice to learn more about him.  But then again, perhaps not knowing anything about him is what makes him such a great character.  \n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/CImmIA",

I did think it was a good and entertaining film, but up until the last 20 minutes (when the story finally gets some engaging, emotional gravitas) it was almost nauseating how cutesy this film was. \n\nThe story is simple, the characters are simple, and frankly every scene without Totoro, or any other fun and creative fantasy creature, is just a plain, but sentimental depiction of childhood.\n\nI give it 4 stars simply because i love the animating style of Miyazaki and that style shines as always in this movie too, every scene with a fantasy creature in it is highly creative and fun (With the busstop scene being the pinnacle of this movie for me), and it's entertaining. I know being too cute and sentimental is a strange criticism, but that really is my only complaint of this film.",

            "content": "I don't particularly care for anime movies. I have seen most of the popular ones and I'm not impressed. I consider Japan's most famous anime directors overrated and the list includes Hayao Miyazaki (keeping him company are: Momoru Hosoda, Isao Takahata, and Satoshi Kon). So, you can imagine that I didn't have high expectations going in; boy was I wrong.\n\nTonari no Totoro needs no introduction, it is the face of studio Ghilbi, its first release alongside Hotaru no haka, and it is referenced  and spoofed in other works constantly. \n\nDuring the first minute of the movie, the experienced viewer identifies the familiar studio Ghibli animation and the newcomer is left wondering how a movie released in 1988 can still look so beautiful, while Miyazaki introduces us to our two heroines, Satsuki (10) and Mei (4), as their father drives them to their new residence, in a rural village. \n\nAfter a few minutes more, we are quick to realize the main characteristic of the movie: This is a story being told while looking through the eyes of a kid. If you think you have heard that one before, allow me to make a distinction; Miyazaki managed to capture the way a kid views the world, in such a way, that it doesn't feel like a story written for kids by adults, but it feels like the accidental filming of a kid's dreamy state of mind. \n\nI will take this point even further; I don't think this is a kid's movie. I recognize, of course, that it has all the elements a kid's movie should have, but I'll insist. I can not imagine a kid older than 6 liking this movie. Most kids will find it unexciting, opting instead for a show that triggers are pulled, or princesses are getting crowned. \n\nI cannot imagine myself up until my late teens liking this movie. Instead I can easily imagine myself saying the Greek equivalent of, \"well, that was a waste of time\" or \"nothing fucking happens\". Indeed the movie seems uneventful at first glance, but there is a distinct shadow of death and loss looming throughout  the movie; Its existence maybe be lost to the younger audiences, but it appeared to me as a potent a \"villain\" as any. \n\nBut it is high time I get to what makes this movie great. After the Kusakabe family steps out of the car, having reached their new home, we, the audience, realize that we have stepped in a magical world. The interesting part is that this magical world feels familiar and I was quick to be filled with nostalgia; watching the two sisters rush to fetch a bucket of water reminded me the first (or, at least, one of the first) times that I watched running water. Those of you who discard these feelings of nostalgia, I ask you to remember the first time that you came across a small river. And then try to imagine who happy and excited you were.\n\nThat brings us to the main point of why Tonari no Totoro is so great; It doesn't coerce nostalgia from us with its imagery, but it reminds us how perfectly happy we were with the simplest of things: The shade of a big tree, a path to the woods, and some folklore. \n\nContinuing, we are introduced to the countryside and its denizens, human and magical, but most of all we experience a sense of harmony between man and nature, so seamlessly interwoven, that it puts preachy environmental-friendly works (including ones from Miyazaki) to shame.  \n\nThe feelings of euphoria and harmony continue, while the two sisters meet and interact with the spirit world and combat the shadow of loss with their own childlike (I mean that in a good sense) way. The ending is simple but fulfilling. \n\nMy new favorite anime movie. 9.0/10.  If you like this one, my second and third favorites Hotarubi no Mori e (8.5/10) and Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki (8.0/10) share some traits.",

The best thing about this movie is that the family feels very realistic. The way they talk and play with one another is exactly as I would expect a real family to act. I also love Totoro and the other creatures of the forest, because they are so adorable. The animation is in a very classic hand-drawn style and gives me flashbacks to the cartoons I watched in my childhood, which certainly makes me smile. If I was still a child I could see myself just adoring this sweet story, and the lovable forest spirits. However, as an adult without kids, I find it kind of simplistic and uninteresting. Also the story lacks a traditional structure, so there's no clear protagonist to connect with, or antagonist to root against, or really any growth or change for the main characters. That's not necessarily a fault, but it made it even harder for me to form an emotional attachment to the events taking place. I hate to take My Neighbor Totoro to task very much, because it is an extremely well-made film and is quite heart-warming. For the target audience it's probably delightful, I'm just not in that target audience.",

            "content": "Founded in 1985, Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation film studio has never looked back. Ghibli has become the pioneer for Japanese animation and has even influenced animation as an industry itself. Hayao Miyazaki is the figure that has particularly shaped anime films for he has directed classic after classic after classic. But with Miyazaki retiring, there is potentially a damaging future ahead for Ghibli because Miyazaki has been the driving force behind its rise. He directed Ghibli√¢??s first film ever in Castle in the Sky, all the way through to 2013 with his last film The Wind Rises. All the best Ghibli productions in the form of Princess Mononoke, Kiki√¢??s Delivery Service, Howl√¢??s Moving Castle and Ponyo have all been touched by the hands of Miyazaki that is how special the guy is! Ghibli, and fans of anime, will truly miss Miyazaki for he was their heart and soul. His greatest creation released in 1988, My Neighbour Totoro, undoubtedly helped bring Japanese anime to the world with a timeless storyline of adventure and wonderful fictional characters. Japanese animated films have grown since Totoro, which perhaps has been the catalyst for Ghibli√¢??s future successes. Anime films that came after Totoro were allowed to receive worldwide notice. Some may consider Spirited Away the greatest of Miyazaki√¢??s creations and best of all anime films, but it would not have been given the time of day to strut its stuff and win the Best Animated Feature of 2002 without My Neighbour Totoro√¢??s influence upon the world. Japanese anime is what it is today for the impact My Neighbour Totoro has had on the world that Ghibli has recognised this and made Totoro their poster boy to which the world can identify with.\n \nMy Neighbour Totoro tells the tale of two young girls, Satsuki and Mei, who have moved to the countryside with their father in order to be closer to their mother who is suffering from a long-term illness in a nearby hospital. Once there, Satsuki and Mei explore and integrate themselves into the surrounding nature and wildlife not knowing that the spirit of the forest lurks nearby. One day, Mei meets and befriends and large creature that roars and is interpreted as √¢??Totoro.√¢?? Satsuki and Mei bond and interact with Totoro and the array of friendly forest spirits in postwar rural Japan, until Mei disappears and Totoro, along with his friends, must come to the aid of Satsuki and help find her sister. My Neighbour Totoro does not present itself as spectacular entertainment, but instead it reveals itself as a warm, cuddly film that the whole family can enjoy. Despite this, the film can become slightly boring as it takes a long time to fully grasp our attention. Our attention is only captured once Totoro reveals himself and the bond between the characters develops. The film thrives off of being itself and not over-the-top in its depictions as it√¢??s about family, nature, relationships, love, the passion for adventure and the ability to lose yourself in the mysteriousness of the world. Every kid will love this film for its sheer sense of exploration and playfulness and may even instigate a fascination of adventure in them rather than the technological inspirations most kids today only know of. \n \nSatsuki and Mei are two young girls whose adventurousness can be felt and reminisced in most of our childhoods. They are so lifelike as they go through stages all children go through from sadness, to ecstasy, curiousness and assurances to their many questions. They do have an irritating side to them as they constantly shriek at one another, however, their bond as sisters in which they do everything together and at the end go to lengthy distances to look after one another makes them admirable characters for they appreciate wildlife, have a sense of adventure and most of all love one another. Totoro, a spirit of the forest, can be described as a giant-furry-cute thing that looks almost like something out of Pok√É¬©mon, which is also made by Japanese people√¢?¬¶ they sure do love their weird animal creations! Totoro is a big round blob that appears scary and powerful but is so friendly and human loving in nature that he easily falls into your good books. He has become over time such a culturally important figure to many people, as he is a cuddly toy for young children, on the shelves of many mature adults√¢?? homes and has even been seen in Toy Story 3 as a doll. Totoro is a magical creation for he captures the awe-inspiring nature of all of our childhoods. He, along with his miniature buddies, are genuinely as loved as Tweetie, Pikachu or Winnie the Pooh for the joy they have brought the world and continue to do so. The Catbus is another creation of Miyazaki√¢??s, but unlike Totoro is some weird looking animal. The thought of a bus-shaped giant cat that has furry seats and windows inside his stomach is truly bizarre. This animal has the potential to give you nightmares but nevertheless remains a remarkable creation that will stick in your mind for its sheer WTF-is-that factor.\n \nMy Neighbour Totoro is a special film for it is not about conflict and violence; it has a different agenda, an agenda that allows the characters to explore, investigate and grow into this vast world with amazing creatures. If you compare My Neighbour Totoro to films of today, or even animated films of the past few years, it is a unique, fascinating film that doesn√¢??t need a goodie or a baddie, but the fascination of life itself to entice you in. Unless you live in a secluded countryside house by yourself, you are going to be influenced by technology and the machinations of the city, and therefore Totoro has developed in my eyes as a criticism of society today for children that prefer to surf the web rather than run about and play with animals in our natural landscapes. Adventure in today√¢??s terms is not using your imagination to experience the beauty of the unexplored world, but instead to feel self-conscious about yourself that you have to please other people and have online exploits. My Neighbour Totoro proves to you that you don√¢??t need anything other than yourself, your boundless imagination, your determination to want to explore and your wonder at the remarkability of life to truly have fun in this world.\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nMy Neighbour Totoro is perhaps the greatest of all Studio Ghibli films for its lasting storyline, sense of adventure and loveable characters have endured it in hearts of many.\n \n√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??     9/10",

The girls soon find out that their new house and the surrounding woods are home to some strange creatures like soot sprites and the friendly, furry, giant Totoro.\n\nThanks to a group in my town called Cinema 100, I was able to see this on the big screen at one of my local theaters this week. This is my personal favorite of Hayao Miyazaki's films that I have seen (Though I would say Spirit Away is his masterpiece). So naturally you have probably guessed that it will be getting a positive review, and you would be right. Unfortunately I have only seen the english dubbed version, but I'm sure the original Japanese version is just as good if not better. Therefore I think I can safely recommend both versions.\n\nFrank Welker is one of the most talented voice actors you probably don't know, but have more than likely heard. He's voiced everything from Fred Jones in most versions of Scooby-Doo, to feral cats on The X-Files, to the monkey Abu in Aladdin. He's the guy who has brought Totoro to life (in the english version at least) and is the high point of the cast. It amazes me the different range, style, and completely non-human sounds he can make.\nDakota and Elle Fanning do a great job voicing the sisters and work great together because, well they are sisters in real life so that defiantly helps them have a believable relationship when interacting with each other.\n\nLike I said, I love this movie. The Bus Stop scene is one of my favorite scenes in all the movies I've ever watched. There isn't much plot to speak of, but it's a beautifully simple story. The hand drawn animation is stunning and makes me continue to miss that style and I wish we could go back to it. It's a great family film for both the young and old alike. If you don't mind foreign language films, give the original version a try if you can find it. If not, you can't go wrong with the 2005 Disney dubbed copy.\n\n10 Reels Out Of 10\n\n\"Neat, I've always wanted to live in a haunted house!\"",

They befriend O Totoro, the biggest and eldest Totoro, who is also the king of the forest. As their girls' mother lies sick in the hospital, O Totoro brings the sisters on a magical adventure but also helps them to understand the realities of life. \n\nMy Neighbor Totoro (or Tonari no Totoro ) is a anime film with: No scary monsters, no villains, no evil adults and not like the other three act structure, and that could surprise a lot of people who are expecting the same third act in animated movie. This movie was beyond loved for being the best animated film ever made and that's from die hard fans of Hayao Miyazaki and moviegoers everywhere, and I can see easily see why, because this movie in opinion is one of the most griping, beautiful and the most stunning anime that actually give me butterflies deep inside of movie, and that's rare for me.\n\nThis may sound over the top or over doing it but I don't Hayao Miyazaki is a god of anime and storytelling to the big screen. I only seen some of Miyzaki films but after watching spirited Away and this movie I want to more of this guys work, I found out that Hayao Miyazaki last film was The Wind Rises which I need to watch sooner or late, but it's a same to hear that, but the good things must come to a end. \n\nI absolutely loved the animation in this film, I mean how can put it into words without messing up my words. It's better to watch and experience the creative animation standing out from any other animated films, and just let the wonderful character's that are fully of joy and life can easily win you over by the first sentence.\n\nFor problems... I don't have any, yeah no problems with this film. I was glued in by the world that Miyazaki created. I was locked in from start till the very end.\n\nOverall My Neighbor Totoro is different and the film doesn't shy away from that, it's a brilliant film and it's more then a kids film even adults can dig this movie.",

My Neighbor Totoro\n\nFor many people, 'Ghibli' means 'Totoro', as this was not only the film which jump started Miyazaki's career, but was also a key influence in spreading Japanese animation around the world. And while the gentle pace didn't initially fair very well, it eventually exploded thanks to the release of cuddly Totoro dolls, one of the company's greatest character achievements (yet still second to Catbus), continuing to stand as Ghibli's mascot to this very day. But it's not all about the peaceful, mystical forest animals, but rather the two girls' curiosity as they are forced to come to terms with the realities of life when their mother falls seriously ill in the hospital and their upbeat dad is left to raise them by himself. And yet even while this aura of death follows the plot around, it also exposes the wonders and warmth of our earthly experiences, revealing mystery and fantasy without conflict or suspense, a different formula-less approach in comparison to some of the studio's similar projects. As almost any critic with a heart will agree, this is essential viewing whether you know Ghibli or not, encouraging the growth of children vicariously through the hope of these characters, which is pretty profound for something so simple. \n\nTo read the rest of my 'Worst to Best: Studio Ghibli' list, click here: http://juicenothing.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/worst-to-best-studio-ghibli.html",

I love these sisters, and I especially love how their characters fit together like puzzle pieces. Their dialogue and exchanges are genuine and heartfelt, and because of this, this might be one of Miyazaki's most honest films. The other characters are fun and memorable, particularly Totoro and Granny, and do I even have to mention the gorgeous animation? I can understand why this film is a little grating for some, as it doesn't have much of a narrative, but this makes the film all the more realistic at its attempt to portray how magical childhood can be. I adore this film; I've seen it dozens of a times and I'll probably see it another dozen more. WATCH THIS FILM!\n\n\nPS, give this film props for getting the Fannings to play Satske and Mei, which adds realism and heart to their characters.",

I am not hesitant to say that no children's film can match My Neighbor Totoro, an absolute masterpiece that ranks alongside if not above every other example of the genre.  A seemingly simplistic childhood fantasy film, Totoro manages to capture the essence of childhood wonder and whimsy while also commenting in a thoroughly intelligent way upon how this disconnect from childhood has led to many of the problems in the adult world.  A profound film about nature, family, and community, Totoro manages to be simultaneously critical and heartwarming.  It is a truly rare film and perhaps the greatest testament to Miyazaki's genius.",
