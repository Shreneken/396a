            "content": "There are people who think that playing around with conspiracy theories is fun. Playing with reality. Pretending there's a plot in every dark corner. Even if they don't actually believe it, they don't realize that they help hold the door open for much darker and more dangerous things. And that they contribute to the collective intellectual erosion of our country. This shows a few of the ways that false information can be used as a deadly weapon.",

At one point it does give a good Insight on the horrible and really negative aspects of Fringe group conspiracies and falsities , as well as Internet groups that inflamed the issue of misinformation. The clear aspects of misinformation they failed to touch on and completely ignored was actually \"trustworthy\" News Network and spins which was quite disappointing. But it covers the fringe side ok",

If your on the right, sit back and be outraged. \nIf you want the truth, you will not find it here.",
