You never know exactly where the film is headed plot wise, but it always seems to wrap up very nicely. The illustrations were  beautiful and loved the characters. Only some parts were a bit too fantastical or felt a little unnecessary, but overall amazing and highly recommend. It hits you in all the feels as a parent, like a good anime film should. If you like studio ghibli you will for sure like this one, that is a bit more mature in some sense.",

I would have liked some deeper themes to be explored in the story.",

Certain elements are usually linked to each other by bearing symbolic meanings. Different creatures become family members. An object, usually an image, takes us back and forth in time. Tradition plays an important role in shaping modern life. In this review, I will explain these recurring elements in five different anime films that Hosoda produced after the 2000s: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006), Summer Wars (2009), Wolf Children Ame and Yuki (2012), The Boy and the Beast (2015), Mirai (2018). We will look at how Mamoru Hosoda reproduces the issues of family ties and childhood, creatures and strangers, traditions and roots, classical master-apprentice relations, country and city, time and space in his unique narrative style. \n\nFull review: https://guncesinema.com/en/from-aliens-to-family-from-family-to-roots/",

This movie creates very beautiful thoughts in the story. Hosoda did very well for this animation feature making life a meaning for the mother, son and daughter. The father had an unfortunate event but this is the movie that teaches a lot about choosing ways of life and distinguishing who you really are.

            "content": "I saw the dubbed version of this film, and I loved it. I thought the (English version) narrators had a soothing and pleasant voice that matched each of the characters. Though the trailer made the film seem more childish than it is, my eyes actually watered several times during the film.\n\nThe plot is a very simple one, but the touch of fantasy gives the film a dramatic twist. In a small town of, presumably, Japan, a young female narrator retells the story of her mother, Hana. As a young college student, Hana falls in love with a man who later reveals himself to be a wolf man. Their relationship develops, and during the course of the next 10+ years, we are flashed forward to when Hana gives birth to her two children, Yuki (\"Snow\") and later Ame (\"Rain\"). Despite the changes that the family has to make to get around, e.g. giving birth at home instead of at the hospital to avoid her children been denoted as \"wolf children\", and hence be subjected to further investigation that would prevent them having a normal lifestyle, Hana and the wolf man's compassion enable them to make do with what they are most comfortable with.\n\nHowever, when tragedy strikes this family and the wolf man suddenly dies, Hana has a hard time taking care of her wolf children. Between working, tending to their needs, and hiding them from the public eye, their lives in the city eventually leads Hana and her children to move to the countryside. There, the children are able to grow more comfortably and freely. It is here where we see Yuki and Ame's personalities blossom as two opposing individuals. The identities they had as children evolve dramatically as they get older.\n\nOn the one hand, Yuki has always been the boisterous and energetic big sister. She's dauntless and witty. When she starts attending school, however, she realizes that she does not fit in with the crowd. Her idiosyncratic tastes in comparison to the girls at her school leads her to believe that she should do more to fit in.\n\nOn the other hand, Ame grew up as the shy and clumsy one. He was by his mom's side most of the times, and was fearful both as human and wolf. When it is time for him to attend school, like Yuki, he goes through a dramatic change. Unlike Yuki, however, the social pressure makes him recoil towards his wolf self, rather than blend in with the human crowd.\n\nWhat I loved most about this film was definitely seeing the characters' develop through the struggles of a clearly atypical lifestyle. Hana's strength as a wife and mother is admirable, and her difficulties understanding and raising her wolf children never take away her cheerful and optimistic personality. As for the children, the people they grew up to be (as teenagers) was definitely different to what I had initially thought. I had believed that they would both embrace their wolf-human personality; however, it is clear by the end of the film that they cannot live as 'both', and both have chosen to embrace one identity over the other. The fact that they chose to left the other identity behind does not mean it stops being part of them, which makes their transition into teenage-hood even harder. Nonetheless, I believe the film showed beautifully how social pressures, parental guidance and external influences can create two people with completely opposed identities (Yuki and Ame), despite having the same upbringing.\n\nOn the surface, the film seems quite childish. But if you have watched, or choose to watch, the film, you'll see that it definitely deals with issues that go beyond that of a simple film. Though there's a conclusive and somewhat-happy ending, it's clearly not the \"happily ever after\" of a children's film. This film really resonated with other Studio Ghibli films that I have watched (despite it not being one), precisely because of the depth that it goes to portray the characters.\n\nRecurring theme that you may have noticed from these anime films is identity and social isolation. All the characters struggle with their identity not necessarily because they are different from those surrounding them, but because they deal with bountiful amounts of inner conflicts that leads them to feel isolated from their surroundings. It's definitely a theme that many individuals can relate to, and the fact that these films portray their complexity to its finest is just beautiful.",

            "content": "When I first heard of \"Wolf Children\" I never knew what to expect, other than thinking about other movies that came before it that were of a similar caliber.  The aspects of parenting, kept secrets, finding one's place in life, magical elements, an odd romance, etc. have been tackled by Walt Disney, Miyazaki, Takahata, and the like.  Wolf Children takes these familiar themes and expands on them without treading on executions that the average viewer has seen before.\n\nA shy, yet kind university student Hana falls for a mysterious man that attends the same university.  While they hang out and build their relationship, he reveals to Hana his family secret: he transforms into a werewolf at nightfall during a full moon.  The two begin a married life and have two children: a daughter named Yumi and son Ami.  Both of who have adopted their father's shapeshifting genes.  The father mysteriously dies during a hunt for food, thus leaving Hana to raise the children as a single mother.  Hana's life as a single mother comes with many hardships, but as she continues she begins to realize that motherhood was what she was destined for.\n\nThe description may seem like something pessimistic, but Wolf Children's premise is anything but.  I must admit that upon my initial viewing, I thought that I had the whole movie figured out.  My impressions were that it was going to be a odd romance, the mother is going to make feeble, luck-based attempts at keeping secrets from the general populace, a possible misunderstanding is about to brew, then there's going to be a message about tolerance as well as environmentalism, etc. while in the back of my mind I was wondering how well the character drama was going to play out.  \n\nWhat I got was quite the contrary.  It turned out that there is no message about tolerance or the environment.  Not to mention that the main conflict does not revolve around Hana keeping her children's secret away from everyone.  The main conflict is more about her being a parent and her children trying to discover their purpose and meaning in life.  While it may seem too simplistic to most, it really works in this movie.  I found myself really getting immersed into the lives of the characters as well as every display of genuine feeling, interaction, and circumstance that took place.  The relationship between Hana and her two kids never ceased to put a smile on my face.  On top of that, I never knew where the story was going and was left guessing what might happen next. \n\nThe artwork and animation are very well done, though in comparison to Hosoda's earlier entries like \"Summer Wars\" and \"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\" the animation does feel a bit more straightforward.  While the fluidity and artistic quality still stand, \"Wolf Children\" does take a more different approach to its scale.  It would stand to reason that, since the majority of \"Wolf Children\" takes place in the countryside and that animation is fiscally limited in and of itself, but unlike the aforementioned films, which had quality in not just the movement of the characters, but also in how the backgrounds were set up to make everything convincing to the viewer that was being presented is an actual world.  \"Wolf Children\" hinges more on scenic displays.  Thus, leaving little room for background interactions and making it feel more linear than the previous films.  Much of the landscapes are very well done and when one actually sees how grand the movie can get in this realm, it truly delivers.  The music is also very well done and really helps in adding to the feeling of each display.\n\nThere is never anything wrong with an artist to tinker with his/her style and while much of \"Wolf Children\" holds up to Hosoda's standards on a technical level, the fact that there isn't as much environmental interaction and a more narrow focus on what is presented combined with a more scenic approach does make it more linear in comparison.  What makes Mamoru Hosoda great is how he can take just a basic story layout and make it interesting without resorting to approaches that one would come to expect.  There are variations and improvements done here and there and there are elements of fantasy intermingled within an otherwise realistic setting, but nothing makes \"Wolf Children\" lose any iota of its identity.  The English dubbing is also expertly handled, but how can one expect any less when Funimation Productions handles the localization? \n\nWolf Children is perhaps one of the most honest movies that aficionado Mamoru Hosoda has done.  Wolf Children is not a preachy film that pulls its story through with clich\u00e9-ridden circumstances to try to add more \"depth\" to its sense of conflict, but relies more on characterizations that appeal to realistic situations with a touch of fantasy to tell a basic story about parenting and finding one's place.  There have been several attempts by Western animators to try and bring adults into the audience, especially with stories that are geared more towards adults.  Though, the general audience has most likely looked at each effort as a niche practice.  Anime may not make up nearly the amount of ticket sales here as it does in Japan, but just because it may come from a culture that differs significantly doesn't mean that it has no right to be seen.  A movie like \"Wolf Children\" absolutely deserves that chance.",

It's about a girl who falls in love with a guy who is actually a sort of shapeshifter, he can turn into a wolf whenever he wants (nothing like a werewolf). And so through some questionable acts she becomes pregnant and they have a beautiful little girl Yuki, and next year a beautiful little boy Ame. Yuki meaning snow in Japanese due to her being born during Winter, and Ame meaning rain in Japanese due to him being born in the rain. After the father unexpectedely dies, the mother, Hana is left alone with her children. And what's so great about this anime is how real it is! Even with the children being part wolves, I can't help but think that this must be how lots of mothers felt raising their children. It handles the story really well and surprisingly isn't that cliched. The art is amazing! It's one of the best looking anime I've ever seen. The voice acting is great, especially the kids. The music is beautiful. I loved it. It fits so great with the movie and makes a beautiful scene even more beautiful! The characters are vivid and very well developed. You can relate to them easily and care about them. The ending is very moving and emotional. It's both happy and heart-breaking at the same time. I won't spoil anything. All in all, this is an amazing anime with great, loveable characters, an interesting plot, a beautiful look and amazing soundtrack! I would deffinetely recommend seeing this anime. Do not miss out!",

She tries her best to be a good mother to them and protect them, keeping them safe from the world knowing their secret. It's a film about parenthood, but also a coming of age tale as well, as you watch the children grow up. It is interesting to see how the kids change their views of their identity as wolves as they get older. They both go in opposite directions from where they first started. It rings true to life. It's the essence of a family drama, I think anyone could relate to. It's beautiful and tear jerking at times.",

It's a great slice of life anime, done well and realistically. Just replace the wolf aspect with a disorder or something along the lines and you've got a highly relatable movie. The three movies of his, don't necessarily have the happiest ending, or sometimes like in this, any real resolve, they just are.
