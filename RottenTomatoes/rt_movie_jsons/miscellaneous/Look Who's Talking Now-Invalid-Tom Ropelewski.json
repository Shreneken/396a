Who thought making one of the voices for said dogs Danny DeVito? Bad enough that Roseanne was a voice in the second film, now we get to add Danny DeVito and his vocals to things I can live without in a movie. This movie did not need the talking dogs at all. Would have been a little bit better if the kids continued to talk but not much. This movie also could have been given a different name as it could have been just a romantic comedy featuring Travolta and Alley with the evil, horny female boss trying to take advantage of her sexy pilot. This movie tried too hard to involve the talking animals in circumstances they were not needed in. Fails on many levels. It is not even that funny, just sad. Also, for the third time in three movies, bad decisions by selfish people nearly cost children their lives. You would think they would have learned their lesson by now but apparently insanity runs in the Ubriacco family. Watch only if you are a sadist really, it is painful to watch.",

This time the kids are grown up and can talk and the dogs are doing the talking. It sounds like a bad idea but it worked well enough. The talking dogs were not bad, in fact, they were the best part of the movie. The Christmas spirit helps a little, but I thought the holiday angle should have a stronger impact on the plot than it did. John Travolta and Kristy Alley thankfully dial it back from their earlier performances and are tolerable this time around. Travolta has a new job and his new wealthy young boss is set on luring him into an affair. This part of the story is acceptable but it is highly predictable and sort of detracts from the dogs and their relation to the family. Where it is fails the worst is the cheesiness. It does not have enough heart, Christmas sprit, or laughs to give it a memorable identity, but this has been a problem for the whole series.",

In the six years since the original Look Who's Talking, Mikey and Julie are now old enough to speak for themselves, so the producers came up with a new gimmick -- talking dogs. The Ubriacco family adopts two surly dogs, Rocks (the voice of Danny DeVito), a street-smart mongrel, and Daphne (voice of Diane Keaton), a snobbish pure bred poodle. The story kicks in with Christmas rapidly approaching and Molly (Kirstie Alley) out of a job. Because of this, her husband James (John Travolta) must work doubly hard to impress his new boss, Samantha (Lysette Anthony). But Samantha, it seems, has hired James for more than what appears in his job description. Samantha contrives a plan to get James to her cabin in the North Woods on Christmas Eve, where she plans to seduce him. James' family races to rescue him from the snowbound cabin, but when their taxi skids off the snow-covered road, it is left to the primal instincts of Rocks and Daphne to save the day.",
