    "summary": "Susanne (Eva Dahlbeck) is a woman in her mid-30s and the owner of a modeling agency in Stockholm. She accompanies her prize model, Doris (Harriet Andersson), on a trip to Gothenburg so that Doris can be photographed. While traveling, both women seek out romance, Susanne with a married lover and Doris with an older gentleman who sees his deceased wife in the young model. The two women struggle to understand their romantic motivations and in the process form an unlikely friendship.",

            "content": "But whose dreams are these?  Ingmar Bergman invites us to dream along with Eva Dahlbeck's fashion designer, Suzanne, and with Harriet Andersson's fashion model, Doris - both dream of relationships (with a past married lover, Ulf Palme, and a new older sugar daddy, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, respectively), that are ultimately not to be.  These men may also be dreaming, or fantasizing, about these women - inappropriately so.  So, this is a film about mistakes and regrets, poor choices and their consequences.  Dahlbeck and Andersson may be paired, such that Doris is an earlier version of Suzanne who may yet have the opportunity to choose a better path.  Perhaps she will - and perhaps Suzanne has come to her senses by the end of the film (or perhaps not?). The men who tempt them are clearly escaping their own dreary existences to chase dreams (that can never be) - but Bergman's interest seems to be focused on the more complicated situations of the women.  Indeed, the film ends with a shot of Dahlbeck wearing a very complex expression (that may be ambivalent, ambiguous, or both).  I had high hopes for the film from the start, when Hilding Bladh's camera work merged with Bergman's direction and ear-popping synchronised sound to create a wordless opening scene (a fashion shoot) with heightened sensory power (and another impressive scene on a train suggests that Dahlbeck is thinking of suicide, with expressionistic flair). But once the protagonists move to G\u00f6teborg, the arthouse moves are toned down and the film loses some zing. Yet, this is still clearly a film by a masterful director, even if less persuasive overall.",

            "content": "A very minor Bergman work, the film has traces of his style, especially in the first few scenes with quick edits and close-ups to draw attention to detail, as well as a well-filmed roller coaster ride. However, the screenplay does not match the quality of the directing, with basically two stories that do not gel all that well together. What the film is meant to be a study of is never clearly focused, with themes of desire as well as women's liberation both present. The middle section of the film dragged a little too, but still it is interesting to see such an early piece of work from Bergman. It is not much compared to what would later come in his career, but the film has enough interesting elements to certainly make it worth a look.",

        {
            "content": "Closely resembles Secrets of Women... short fragments of romances at different stages, except this time it's two stories instead of three. Harriet Andersson's interactions with Gunnar Bjornstrand are pure gold, and the story has more nuance. The Eva Dahlbeck thread is good, too, but seems a bit stuffy next to the vivacity of Andersson's. Some great camera stuff, too, like the carnival rides.",
