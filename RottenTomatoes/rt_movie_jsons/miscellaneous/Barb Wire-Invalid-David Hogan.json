    "summary": "A sexy nightclub owner, Barb Wire (Pamela Anderson Lee) moonlights as a mercenary in Steel Harbor, one of the last free zones in the now fascist United States. When scientist Cora Devonshire (Victoria Rowell) wanders into Barb's establishment, she gets roped into a top-secret government plot involving biological weapons. Soon Barb is reunited with her old flame Axel Hood (Temuera Morrison), who is now Cora's husband and a guerrilla fighter, resulting in plenty of tense action.",

The bad guy is a over the top cartoonishly acted villain, the Chief is not bad and the others are just ok and generic. Anderson has some moments she is passable but for the most part her acting and line delivery are not good. The cinematography is bad. The camera angles are very dynamic and half the time they work and are well lit and shot and the other half there is no need for them and they out of place. There is a large chunk though that is devoted not to telling any kind of story or setting tone but instead to show off Pamela Anderson's body and many times this film feels like a porn flick. The music is the best thing in this. wouldn't call it good but it was above average. Over the top at times but got the job done. The editing is not good in this. This feels like a film that wants to be a Noir, Action B-Movie, and a pornography flick and it doesn't work. The pacing is terrible in this also and the worst part. The whole middle chunk of the film is just exposition and things just happen with no action or any compelling characters. The middle is where this feels like a Noir but it is boring lacking the needed ingredients to make a compelling Noir work. It's a flawed, trashy and sometimes creative mess. Honestly skip this. It's Not Good.",

Back to the film: A lust fest to how hot Anderson was, unrealistic how tough she is.  The rest was predictable and more sad then enjoyable.  The predicted future of what 2017 didn't come true, so that was the most interesting part of the film.  It was surprising that they used Canadian money in the bargaining, so I thought it was low budget Canadian film.",

I try to think of a situation that is analogous and only the Last Supper by Da Vinci comes to mind. In the case of Barb Wire, a somewhat deeper analogy must be made, deeper as in really, really, really, really bad. Obviously oriented towards men who don't get out of the house much, the strong female character Pam Anderson tries to bring to life might be appealing to girls wanting to see one of their own kind giving the guys the stick.\nIt's the story of a woman living in a dystopian civilization and how she runs amok of the grand poobah of that society who, along with his lackies, dress as later day fascists. That seems to be the plot, but what the movie is really about is Pam Anderson doing her best to convince men everywhere to watch a sequel she hopes will go in production or maybe sell some calenders, or something, who knows where a movie like this will take you. Instead of doing all that, Barb Wire had the opposite effect on her career.\nThe Hollywood guys looking at the contract for the movie must have thought it had all of the right elements, not reading the script carefully was their first mistake. It's a simple story that was the sole sustenance of most Italian Mad Max ripoffs, and by now it is very tired.\nBarb wire reminds me a bit of Barbarella, as a matter of fact maybe Barb Wire's full name is Barbarella Wire, getting back on track, Pam Anderson, if you can believe it, has the same problem Jane Fonda had in Barbarella: she isn't sexy enough to overcome the movie's other faults.",

Also I heard the film is just action type rip off of Casablanca. I have never seen that film, so I can't really make any comparisons. I must say though, Barb Wire is a really bad movie, not the worst but still it's really bad. \r\n\r\nBarb Wire (Pam Anderson) is a Bounty hunter working right in the middle of the second American Civil War. There is a plot regarding a new type of Aids Virus called Red Ribbon... and honestly that's all I got from this movie. Really, the plot of this film is really confusing at times. We can thank the clumsy and sloppy dialogue for that. Yes, this film suffers the same problem as Gigli, the writing and dialogue sound absolutely ridiculous. More than half the movie, I had no idea what anyone was talking about. Whenever anyone said anything, I would think to myself \"What the hell\"? Even when you read the synopsis of Barb Wire, the plot still sounds confusing and it makes no real sense. \r\n\r\nIt also doesn't help that practically the entire cast either can't act or just doesn't give a performance at all. And yes, Pamela Anderson can't act to save her life. Which is actually a shame because there are times when I se her trying to have emotion. Sadly though, a lot of the time it comes off fake and almost like she doesn't care at the same time. Along with that, Barb Wire as a character is just a bitch. And there's not much of a reason for her to be a bitch either. Yeah, we get this weak explanation that her fiancée left her. However, that relationship is never explored and Barb never grows or changes from her experiences. She's only good for two things, shooting a gun and showing off her boobs. \r\n\r\nWith all that being said, there were a few scenes that I actually had fun watching. A lot of the action and gun fights were pretty entertaining. Plus, the film actually has a pretty decent climax, though I must admit the conclusion was rather stupid and pointless. \r\n\r\nTo wrap up this review, Barb Wire is a terrible movie but still I have seen a lot worse. The writing is stupid, the acting is awful and all the characters are pretty much one note stereotypes or flat. However, if you're a fan of big explosions, gun fights, action and really huge breasts you might have a good time watching Barb Wire.",

Anderson seems only seems capable of posing and looking the part of a grossly disproportioned comic book heroine. She does certainly look the part, but that doesn't make up for the films many other faults. I would note that she's not the only one to blame for what went wrong with this film. Garish costumes, set design and photography, along with direction that's more focused on weak MTV stylistics than actually developing scenes, character or story. However, in the plus column, there's a good supporting cast of familiar character actors, including Udo Kier, Tiny Lister, Steve Railsback, Xander Berkeley (in the Claude Raines role) and Clint Howard (in the Peter Lorre role). Berkeley, Kier and Temuera Morrison (in the Paul Henrid role) do strike the right tone for the film, but unfortunately no one else seems to get it. But the biggest plus for the film, which really showed that the film had potential, is the story premiss of a post apocalyptic Casablanca with a female Rick Blain. The script is actually decent and the film definitely had potential, but Anderson and a ham handed production make it just a mess and into a nearly unwatchable film.",
