            "content": "I'd love to see this re-edited. It is way too stylistically edited with non-stop quick cuts, overdubs, nonlinearity. There's so much truly spectacular creativity and content here, but the substance is way overshadowed by style -- which is impressive in its way but ultimately skirts very close to gimmicky. The footage is astonishing, the talent is there, the history -- all good but, again. it suffers from a lack of overarching cohesion due to its manic editing. I would love to give it 4.5 or 5 because it's a gorgeous labor of love, but it's too all over the place.  It should be a 5-part series, going into the facets that are merely touched on.",
