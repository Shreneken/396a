    "summary": "Following a stint in jail, Adam (Ulrich Thomsen), a former neo-Nazi, is temporarily assigned to live in a religious enclave. The community is led by Ivan (Mads Mikkelsen), an eternally optimistic priest who immediately gets under the skin of the gruff Adam. In order to move forward with his rehabilitation, Adam must select a task, so he decides to bake an apple pie. However, his simple choice is complicated by Ivan's insistence that Adam use apples from a tree that is plagued by problems.",

Yes, even the most violent and ill formed must find love for ultimate change. Just ask Ivan the preacher. He's got the touch. \n\nAt first appearance, one may feel that Ivan is another gung-ho liberal, lover of all who ignores reality, pretending there is no evil in the world because, well, he's never seen it and is naive as hell. But Ivan is not of that ilk. He only appears to be soft of mind and soft of heart and upbringing. But as the film progresses, you get the feeling that this soft nut not only has a hard shell but center as well. Why? Well, he was raped as a child, lost his wife to suicide, and his son to a debilitating disease, at least mentally. He's worked so hard to ignore these facts that even his tumor can't take his life. It apparently just likes to remind him to stay distracted with a little bleeding from the ear when things get too real so as to stave off ultimate demise. But why? Well, it appears Ivan is on a mission. \n\nThe Neo-nazi, Adam (appropriately named) initially takes delight in discovering that Ivan can only survive by ignoring reality and does everything in his power to grind that reality down Ivan's throat. What's a neo-Nazi to do? \n\nAh, but there's something a foot here. There appears to be a soft center in this lover of killing and hate, for Adam begins to take a shine to Ivan and even becomes protective by film's end, grows hair, and becomes an advocate of all things Ivan, supporting him as only a good brother in faith can.Maybe Adam just respects how tough Ivan is, and how he's not only able to overcome his great challenges but reaches out best he can, bravely, kindly to help others. He's part miracle, part insane savior. And it appears Adam finds these qualities endearing and expanding. Could our killer have found human compassion? Say it isn't so! Ah, Ivan what have you done?\n\nA violent, perverse love story. Certainly, one of a kind. A must view.",

            "content": "Of Course, Some Miracles Are More Pleasant Than Others  \r\n\r\nTerry Pratchett has said that the problem people have is that they assume all miracles are good.  If something really, truly terrible happens that is against all odds, is that less of a miracle than something amazing which happens that is against all odds?  And so, when many bad things continue to happen to one person, why assume that the person has come to the attention of the Devil?  Why not assume that God just doesn't like the person?  I mean, if you're to assume the attentions of either one and not just a string of coincidences.  To me, the real problem is that people just don't seem to believe in coincidence despite the fact that, arguably, quite a lot of what happens to us only happens because of a string of them.  The fact that you are alive at all is either a coincidence or a miracle, depending on your perspective.  Some coincidences, however, are just a little more unbelievable than others.\r\n\r\nAdam Pedersen (Ulrich Thomsen) is on probation.  He has been released into the care of Ivan Fjelsted (Mads Mikkelsen), a priest or minister of some kind.  (I don't recognize the vestments.)  Adam is an unrepentant neo-Nazi who seems to have something planned for his future, after his parole is up, but Ivan basically ignores it.  Also living at the church are Gunnar (Nicolas Bro), an alcoholic rapist, and Khalid (Ali Kazim), a Saudi who claims to have been robbing convenience stores to get back the money the parent company owes his family for their stolen land.  Ivan does not notice that Gunnar is still drinking or that Khalid is still holding up stores.  Adam decides that he wants to force Ivan to face reality, which the local doctor (Ole Thestrup) says is nearly impossible.  Ivan is incapable of experiencing anger or sorrow, and he has a brain tumour the size of a volleyball and a son paralyzed with multiple sclerosis.  Ivan firmly believes everything that goes wrong is the Devil testing him.\r\n\r\nOne rather suspects that Ivan is used to being the strangest, most intimidating person in the room, and that just isn't true anymore.  From the very first, there is Ivan, who tells him that Adam himself must work out what he is to do there.  Adam announces that he is going to make an apple pie, probably because it was the first thing which sprang to mind.  He was merely being stubborn, but Ivan took him up on it.  It's strange enough that Ivan handed him an apple from the tree and then told him not to eat it, because it wasn't ripe.  That was probably part of Adam's prompt.  Ivan is also firm about the idea that Gunnar is no longer alcoholic, that Khalid no longer robs liquor stores.  Adam does not have to be the most perceptive of men to realize that it simply isn't true.  What Adam cannot work out is why Ivan believes it to be true.  And once he does, all he wants to do is break the man, prove to him that turning the other cheek doesn't work.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the strongest turning point of Adam's rehabilitation is the death of Poul Nordkap (Gyrd L\u00f8fquist).  I suspect \"Nordkap\" is some sort of Danish joke that I don't get on account of not speaking Danish, but at any rate, Poul was one of those people who, upon the German invasion, worked with and for the Nazis instead of resisting them.  In a sense, he is who Adam believes himself to be.  However, even decades later, he is consumed with remorse.  At least one of the nurses is strongly implied to be Jewish, and the nurse takes good care of him despite what happened in his past.  Poul saw what Adam thought was right, and he is now ashamed of it.  What's more, Khalid is quite probably in the right, though there are holes in his claim.  Perhaps turning the other cheek doesn't work for everyone, but Adam can't deny that it leaves you with more personal satisfaction than, for example, working in a concentration camp.  At least, Poul doesn't seem to have gotten any satisfaction out of it.\r\n\r\nWhen I read the plot description of this movie, I thought it would be more whimsical--and that Ivan would be our sympathy character.  In a sense, we do feel sympathy for Ivan, though it's certainly true that he's not a well man.  However, the movie manages to create sympathy for Adam.  He only has so much interest in the pie, and he certainly sees through both Gunnar and Khalid.  He would also give different advice to Sarah Svendsen (Paprika Steen), though it's arguable that he would have taken away happiness normal people would never have expected her to find.  The problem, I think, is that Adam and Dr. Kolberg are the closest the movie gets to normal.  Adam believes himself to be evil, but there is something to be said for having an awareness of your own personality, even if it's a bad one.  Gunnar and Khalid are both a bit on the dense side, though it's hard to tell with Khalid, given that about the only Danish he has really mastered are words Ivan would doubtless like him not to use.",

I say surprisingly because there's aspects to each character that would easily make them very unlikable but the movie handles its characters with care and they end up being believable characters that grow on you.  Sometimes the movie can definitely be cruel with its humor, but that's definitely part of the charm.  I thought the movie sort of laid back on the humor as it went on, but it has a good story of this man, Adam, redeeming himself.  Mads Mikkelsen is definitely very entertaining as Ivan, he plays the role completely serious and that's where a lot of the comedy comes from.  So yea I really liked this movie, it's not perfect but it's a very enjoyable black comedy.",

            "content": "Like a story by Flannery O'Connor, re-imagined as one of the Coen Bros. grim fables, this Danish film by Anders Thomas Jensen comes completely out of left field.  A neo-Nazi skinhead, Adam (Ulrich Thomsen), is sent to a rural church which is also a half-way house, there to perform community service.  The pastor, Ivan (Mads Mikkelsen),  who seems like a combination of saint and idiot, assigns him to care for a fruitful apple tree on the property and, when summer is over and the apples are ripe, bake an apple pie.  This is his project, and although Adam has no intention of doing any such thing, and offers the good pastor no cooperation, there is something afoot here that he cannot understand.\r\n\r\nThe preacher, Ivan, accepts every effrontery with a shrug and and excuse, \"well, that just rude,\" even to the point of taking bloody beatings from his new resident.  The church has a minuscule congregation including an overweight former tennis star who is a kleptomanic and a rapist, a Saudi terrorist who is robbing service stations to finance his collection of weapons, a pregnant alcoholic woman, and an aging concentration camp guard with a bad conscience. \r\n\r\nThe determined, if unrealistic optimism, of his mentor keeps Adam off guard, as he tries to figure out just what is going on.  Meanwhile, Adam's apple tree is assaulted by ravenous crows, an infestation of worms, and ultimately an apocalyptic thunderstorm.  In his room, beneath a picture of the Fuhrer, Adam reads the book of Job and determines to see if he can test the pastor to the extreme, to prove that God must in fact hate him, and in short order he seems to accomplish just that... but now it is Adam who will be tested as the first inklings of compassion come upon him like a virus.\r\n\r\nA comedy as black as crows in an apple tree, \"Adam's Apples\" is an off-kilter morality play that never states the obvious.  It would rather play with the viewers assumptions of life and meaning, action and consequence, mixing them all up in an over-heated farcical drama, until they produce a surprising and tasty result, a film as sweet and satisfying as a warm apple pie.",

It begins with a priest named Ivan driving an unrepentant neo-Nazi named Adam from prison to the church where he will be performing his community service. Ivan gives Adam the choice of one goal to set for himself to complete, before he leaves. Ivan, completely uncaring, chooses to make an apple pie from the apple tree outside the church, once they are ripe.\n\nFrom there, things quickly get out of hand. Let's just say that the sensitive need not apply. \n\nI recommend Adam's Apples to people with a dark sense of humor, who are fine with laughing at incredibly inappropriate (yet incredibly amusing) things. This movie was made for people like you and me. \n\nI'm not referring to low-brow humor. This is a different animal. An utterly unique (as far as my experience goes), intelligent comedy that ultimately brings sunshine forth from some of the darkest clouds you've ever seen (both figuratively and literally).",

Said priest also tends to an Arab terrorist, a former tennis star, and his son, who's confined to a wheelchair and never once speaks or moves during the entire film.  Then, much silliness happens followed by more, and so forth, until God gets angry, blows up the cooker (stove), causes lightning to strike the plot-device-apple-tree, forces the former tennis star to rape a drunk woman whose role in the film serves no purpose, and makes the skinhead's other skinhead buddies shoot the priest in the head (but who later wakes up and walks out of the hospital having only the aforementioned brain tumor shot out of his skull).

In addition to the neo-Nazi whom he is trying to save, there is also an obese kleptomaniac, a pregnant woman, and a middle eastern terrorist, all living at the rectory.  It is not a large cast.  It could easily be shown on stage.  It won awards in Amsterdam, Brussels, Warsaw, and Wisconsin!. It is funny and a feel good film if you can withstand the other stuff.  \"God hates you, Ivan.\" (Danish with English subtitles)",

            "content": "Never before have I seen comedy played out in such a dramatic sense. \n\nAnders Thomas Jensen is probably one of the most distinguished screenwriters out there, even though he is Danish. This is the guy who wrote Brothers, The Duchess and several other high-rated films, as well as a director of top-notch Dogma 95 films.\n\nI am inspired to learn more about the Danish film industry. Anders T Jensen has worked in the creation process of many Western hits, but it doesn't stop there. Ulrich Thomsen, the neo-Nazi, has also been in a handful of American films, such as the 2009 film Duplicity as well as a supporting role in 20007's Hitman. Mads Mikkelsen, the priest (AMAZING actor) had a role in the 2006 Casino Royale remake, and he is going to play in the upcoming hit, Clash of the Titans.\n\nAdam's Apples starts with Ivan, the priest, driving Adam to the church. Adam is fresh out of jail and has been sentenced to 12 weeks of community service before he can be released back into society. \n\nAdam is bothered by Ivan, who refuses to acknowledge any misdoings in the world is not the direct cause of the devil. We first see this in Adam's entrance review. Ivan is reading the papers the prison sent with Adam. The paperwork says Adam is pure evil. \"This is rude, no man can be evil, let alone pure evil\" Ivan retaliates.\n\nAdam cannot get through Ivan's head. He tries upsetting him via words, via physical violence, but each time Ivan turns the other cheek, only expressing either gratitude of indifference. \n\nThat is, until Adam starts to get through to Ivan, causing him to bleed from the ears. \n\nThe comedy was very forthright (almost French in style), but done in such a dramatic sense. At first I was hesitant at understanding the intentions of the comedic scenes, however halfway through the film I finally understood due to a scene involving many people being shot, for what would normally be fatal, but walking away arm in arm as cripples.\n\nThis type of story has been done before. Many times in fact. This movie is a satire of these stories, however not in a sense of making fun of them, but more so a re-imagining.\n\nRATINGS:\n\nPersonal Affect   5/5\nI enjoyed it thouroughly and it flowed like a smooth yet fruity wine. It kept me uplifted yet intrigued. Beyond all else, it posed a thought-provoking situation.\n\nVisuals 4/5\nFor a director who is notorious for Dogma 95 style filmmaking, I was pleasantly surprised in how well everything turned out. The crew really understood how to use nat lighting to it's fullest, and when it was trying to capture moods it would become visually stunning. The camerawork and angles were well thought out as well to match the mood and to illustrate how at points some are metaphorically larger than life.\n\nStory 5/5\nWhat an amazing writer. He's on my favorites list.\n\nOverall 5/5\nNeed I say more?",
