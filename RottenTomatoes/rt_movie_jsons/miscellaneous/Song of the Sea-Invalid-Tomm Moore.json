With astounding visual richness that puts the wonder of the natual world squarely in the spotlight along with a gripping storyline and relatable characters, this is a masterful Celtic comparison to the most favourite of Studio Ghibli creations. I was swallowed up by the story and the spectacular scenery. Utterly Briliant. I will never tire of revisiting this new classic.",

The backgrounds are lush and intricately designed, the characters are distinct, and the story is impeccable. This movie was made by an Irish animation studio, and is a much needed wake up call to the fact that we should broaden our horizons when looking for movies and shows to view, not automatically going for what we've heard is good or what was made in Japan or America. And there is no problem with anime; it is an art form unto itself, and has had an inimitable impact on pop culture as we know it. Same with Western animation. It just seems like a good idea to expand our views to places often looked over, and this movie proves that.",

Song of the Sea is the work of director Tomm Moore, writer Will Collins, and the genius animation/visual artwork of Cartoon Saloon.\nThis is a phenomenally stunning work of animation artistry. The film is driven as much, if not more, by the drawing, colors and imaginative focus of the animative world they created as it is by the story itself. That story is one of a young boy, his father, and the little sister who live in the aftermath of the loss of the mother & wife. The brother learns a extraordinary fact about his sister, whom he is annoyed with and tires of as a typical young boy would. \nOnce the boy learns this great secret, one new to his sister as well, he becomes driven to set things right for her as she is missing an essential part of her self, in a sense, and will perish without it. Here is where some issues of formulaic situations and some flat moments come in. There are obvious plot points and some unwanted melodrama here. But, again, the art work in the animation carries the day. 3.6 stars for me.",

            "content": "Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend.\n\nThe animation in this beautiful, and some of it reminds me (vaguely) of \"Spirited Away\", but makes more sense.  I'm sure the relation is the sense that \"Spirited Away\" is Miyazaki's display of the Japanese fey, though it is apparently in several other movies (e.g. \"My Neighbor Totoro\", \"Ponyo\").\n\nThis is a movie of great tragedy and powerful feelings, but ultimately is about appreciating your family and people while they are there.  There is charm and uplifting feelings to the entire situation: you're not just going to be depressed or moved.\n\nAs the introduction of the fey start, it is very unclear what is real and what is magic, or if the magic is real.  That surreal attitude to this child's adventure seemed to add to the charm of dealing with the situation.\n\nThe only problem I have with the movie is this ambiguity, there are so many parallels (that often occur in fey stories) to reality that you can't tell if this is a story of how a boy imagined an adventure, or if it's a fey story full of hidden magic.\n\nThe details they go into are amazing if you look.  Even the tears shared between fey and human are different.  The details go on, and while I'm not sure if the quality is better, worse, or just different to a Miyazaki film, I feel it was made with the same consideration for how the audience is supposed to feel as they watch in the same way he created.",

            "content": "I should probably just say up front that I often struggle with fantasy stories that focus on a lot of magical and mystical things. Song of the Sea is a film that fully embraces the world of fairies, spirits, and other magical beings. It is connected with Irish folklore, which is something I know little about, aside from the concept of selkies. Needless to say, I had a hard time getting fully invested in this story, and remained a bit checked out through the whole thing. There were also a number of logic questions that kept coming to mind, and I had to remind myself that a fantasy adventure requires some suspension of disbelief, no different than one of my superhero movies. Who knows why I can fully buy into the fact that a human being can turn into a giant green rage monster, and yet I struggle when one turns into a seal, but for some reason my brain fights against this kind of fairy tale. The plot that I cared about was the big brother trying to watch out for his little sister, and when I could overlook the mystical mumbo-jumbo, I enjoyed seeing how he grew from resenting her into genuine affection. They did a good job of building up his character in the early scenes, and you could understand the arc of his emotional journey through the film. It felt a bit like everyone else was a non-character, though. The sister does so little, and is merely a damsel in distress. The parents are not in most of the film, to the point that the villains have more of a stake in the story than them. I will say that the art style of Song of the Sea was adorable. It has a cute childlike quality to it that I enjoyed. One final thing I have to mention, the titular song was a bit overused in the film. I was starting to get tired of it by the end, and considered it annoying when the tune was stuck in my head afterwards. Clearly, Song of the Sea isn‚Äôt exactly my cup of tea, but it had some elements that I appreciated, even though I doubt I‚Äôll be watching it again.",

            "content": "Song of the Sea has good visuals, but the story is rather weak and forgettable. The movie spends little, if any time explaining the concepts and story elements. It seemed like the movie introduced too many new ideas too quickly and I knew from early on that they probably wouldn't be tied together in the end. Many parts of the story are literally never explained at all. I got the sense that the movie drew upon Irish legends that I guess we were already supposed to know, so the movie does you the favor of not telling you the greater context just in case you aren't familiar with Irish folktales. For most of the movie, I felt a little lost as to why things were happening the way they were or who these weird characters were. I had hope that things would come together neat and tidy in the end, but to no avail. \n\nOne of the main words that comes to mind was \"slow\". It was a family movie in that it starred children, but not in that it was funny or easy to follow. I honestly wouldn't think many children would like this movie unless they were only old enough to think the animation is pretty, which it usually is. The characters weren't particularly interesting or likable. That may have been due to the lack of character development. \n\nOverall, I guess I'd say the movie is very subtle and understated if anything. It's pretty to look at, but the slow pacing and lack of elaboration on anything made the film a little hard to sit through, especially considering there wasn't much payoff in the end. It's kind of a family movie, but it's not really a typical kids movie despite how I can really only picture a very young child being totally in love with this movie. It's a boring, poorly explained movie with good visuals. 3/10",
