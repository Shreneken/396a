Young Surya blames his father inability for his sister's death... \nAparna was not only cute, she's the main pillar of this film, Love Bommi...\nCinematography was top notch...\nMilestone in Surya's acting career...\nBtw missing many scenes from the trailer in released movie version...\n\nSoorarai Potru(vom)... \ud83d\udc4f",

            "content": "Soorarai Pottru- 10/10. Suriya stars and produces this inspirational based on a true story tale of a man who wanted ordinary people to be able to fly on a airplane. Through the hardships and embarassments that are put against him, he continuously tries to create his dream come true. From his humble beginnings in a village, to becoming an airforce pilot, to putting the building blocks towards his dream, director Sudha Kongara has created an excellent rags to riches film. She puts a fictional spin on Captain Gobinath's inspirational story, but the main focus stays true to heart: never let anyone diminish or destroy your dreams. Suriya, the actor, comes back with full energy and power in this film. This role reminds me of the characters he played in movies like Nandha and Vaaranam Aayiram. He brings the anger and passion that is the character of Maara. He definitely deserves multiple awards for bringing this person to life. Aparna Balamurali also does an amazing job as the equally determined and passionate wife of Maara. She is in the story throughout, and she elevates the scenes with her strong screen presence. Supporting roles from Urvashi, Karunas, and Vivek Prasanna also help bring the acting quotient to a higher degree. Music by G.V. Prakash Kumar fits really well with the films raw and real dynamic, while Niketh Bommireddy really captures the colours and vision of Sudha through his cinematography. The main message in this film is one that is needed to be heard by anyone and everyone. Never let your dreams stay on the ground. Let your dreams fly, and never let your burning desire be extinguished. Watch the movie and get inspired!",

Her direction also marvolous and actresses aparna balamurali performance is excellent. The legend urvasi acting was remarkable. All must watch this flim to get inspired. It is a very motivating story. My mark is 90/100. So please watch this movie. It could be one of the best flim in our Indian cinema.",
