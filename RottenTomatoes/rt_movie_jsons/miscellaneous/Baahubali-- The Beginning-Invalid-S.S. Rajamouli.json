            "content": "I learnt about this movie through memes and social media blogs. I didn't have a TV connection back then and I wasn't much into pop culture, so I didn't really know what this movie was about. I just saw that this movie had a lot of special effects and it used animators, so obviously it had to be good. I practically begged my parents to let me see this movie in the theatres. I hadn't been to the theatres for the last 7 years, and they finally gave me the permission to see this one. And I wasn't disappointed.\nThis is the kind of movie that can be enjoyed to its fullest only in the theatres. Everything about it was superb - the CGI (considering the technology and experience of CGI in India is not very advanced), the acting, the music, the colour palette, the locations, the overall tone, everything is perfect. Watching Shiva climb the waterfalls, the battle scenes, Shiva alone pulling Bhallaldeva's statue, all of this looked great when being watched on a giant screen.\nThe story finally ended on a cliffhanger for the second part, which is another movie for which I requested my parents to let me see, but that's for the other review. But it was an actual good cliffhanger, unlike the usual sequel baiters that we normally see in high budget action or superhero movies, or the money squeezing that happens when one movie becomes successful. This one actually meant it.\nThis movie basically introduced me to South Indian cinema. Until then I was thinking all South Indian movies are the same, with unrealistic actions and cringy humour. But this one was different. Just by looking at it you know this one really means business. I hope in future we will get to see more such Indian movies that make us proud that we have a film industry that prioritises quality over quantity.",

Watching the first part of this supposed two-parter is a scintillating, absolutely fresh experience. Packed with dazzling elements and groundbreaking direction, the SS Rajamouli film is so strong that even the sidekick performers deliver with solidity on the screens.

A handful of scenes felt unnecessary but for the most part, everything is pretty relevant to the overall story. The action scenes are over the top fun and the dialogue exchanges between characters stay fairly engaging. The main gripe I have about the movie is some of the visual effects. While some of the effects are top notch and completely believable, others feel clearly unrealistic and it just took me out of certain moments.

The production values are decent - if not comparable to Hollywood tales of matching epic proportions, like Troy [2004] or Immortals [2010]. However, the art direction is quite compelling, with great shots of (CGI-enriched) landscapes and vibrant colors. The plot is presented in an interesting and competent way and makes the story of the Baahubali family fascinating. The downsides include an apparent overuse of certain camera techniques (i.e. close-ups and slow-motion), a clich\u00e9d plot, and poor writing - at least in the subbed version. Baahubali: The Beginning might not be as big and its underlying concept was intended, however, it could be the start of something big.\nOverall 6/10\nFull Review: https://movie-discourse.blogspot.de/2018/05/baahubali-beginning-in-2015.html?view=flipcard\nTwitter: @Max4Movies",

            "content": "Baahubali may be a household name in India today. Famed blockbuster-director SS Rajamouli's magnum opus, Baahubali was touted to be the most expensive Indian film ever made, and India's answer to Hollywood's 300. Starring Telugu superstar Prabhas in the titular role, Baahubali was shot simultaneously in Tamil and Telugu and was dubbed into Hindi and Malayalam. With the largest ever film poster, unveiled in Kochi recently; and big studio backing (Dhrama Productions), the film consistently ensured that it was the talking point in tinsel town. \n\nI, for one, was not impressed by the buzz and expected it to be a classic South Indian big budget fare, with a larger-than-life hero and inconsistent screenplay. But it was the reviews that changed my mind. To my surprise, the film was well-received by critics in all regions, with universal acclaim from the national media. Rajeev Masand gave it 4 stars and called it the perfect blockbuster. Even more surprisingly, Indian Express' Subhra Gupta, known for her mercurial ratings to even the best of films, gave the film 4 stars (The last time she gate it was for Queen) and called it simply spectacular. I decided to see if the movie is India's Lord Of The Rings and Rajamouli is India's Peter Jackson.\n\nAnd in the process, HISTORY WAS CREATED. For the first time ever, I fell asleep in the cinema hall. Literally. Yes, I have seen a lot of bad movies, but I have always managed to keep my eyes open, hoping for one good frame. But this time, I was unable to do even that. Though it was just for a few seconds that my eyes closed, that fact that I did so speaks volumes about my disenchantment with the film. I was bored, YES. And what could be worse, when you have come hoping to be entertained, to be treated with a spectacle.\n\nRajamouli's epic-drama is about Baahubali, who as a child, was smuggled out of the kingdom of Mahishmati and raised by tribals after being found at the foot of a waterfall. Grown up,he has super-human strength and is drawn to his home and to an angel- like beauty of his fantasy. Sure enough, the film follows his journey of self-discovery and who his really is. Ah.. and juxtaposed in between a romance, some macho muscle-flexing, and a bloody battlefield, taken right out of Mahabharata and J R R Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings (LOTR) trilogy.\n\nThey say it is the most expensive film ever made. I don't know where all the money went. Sure enough, we are treated to loads of visual landscapes, huge kingdoms, and all that stuff. But never did I got a sense of awe I felt watching LOTR. It all feels dated and honestly, a bit obsolete. We see Baahubali flying in the air, dangling through tree-branches beside a humungous waterfall and single-handedly moving a huge statue made of gold. Is he really a God? If he is, we are not given a clue. Ah.. and the action sequences. Terrible is all I can say. I mean, how much can you watch the hero flying in the air and hitting villains. After a while, this masochistic hero with his toned body and muscles (emphasized a little too much) doing the same stuff overwhelms you, and then frustrates you.\n\nA much praised aspect of this movie was how the female characters were strong and fiery. What? Tamannah, as the warrior princess Avantika shines early on, but soon she turns out to be a damsel-in-distress waiting for her hero to turn her from her \"ugly\" self to his personal fetish, undressing her and turning her into a sex object. I cringe when I think of how this so-called romance is akin to the sequence where the villain Palvaalthevan (Rana Dagubatti ) is taming a bull. Sexist! Other female characters do a decent job of what is given to then but that too amounts to nothing.\n\nThe performances in the film are as good as the screenplay- poor. The male leads do nothing other than flash their toned bodies and perform acrobatic fights. Ramya Krishnan shows flashes of how fantastic an actor she is, but alas, how much can you do with a poorly written character. Honestly, the only redeeming point was the battlefield sequence, which was well executed, and the climax. sure, the huge warfare is heavily inspired from LOTR and other epics, but it was better that the first half. Other than these two bright points, the whole film was in shambles. Choppy editing, a weak screenplay and terrible dialogues ensure that there is no emotional depth. We don't get euphoric as we do when watching a James Cameron's Avatar or shed tears as we do for Tolkien's hobbits (LOTR).The music and background score are mediocre, at best. Two songs, a romantic track for the leads and an item number, make matters worse.\n\nSitting through 2 hours and 40 minutes of visual torture, I couldn't help thinking about the Peter Jackson's LOTR films. I used to hate fantasy-adventures, but the trilogy changed all that. I still cherish those characters and their lives. A lot of frequent references to this classic had me in tears, because it ruined my memories of LOTR. Rajamouli has ensured that there is nothing in Baahubali that made LOTR a classic, a weak lead character fighting a powerful villain and in the process discovering his strength; great visuals and cinematography and an assured direction by Peter Jackson. Instead, it chose to go along more with   300 ( A film I absolutely hate), with its unreal locales and stylish action with no strong emotional quotient).\n\nI'm sorry to say this, Mr Rajamouli, but your magnum opus was an epic-disaster for me. I don't care how much the mainstream critics loved it, I hated it. And come to think of it, I can't remember the last time when I saw a film as bad as this! When Bollywood's brain-dead celebrity, Kamaal R Khan tweeted yesterday calling Baahubali a stupid movie and called the people behind it gendas, I hated what he said. Today, while I still feel he used denigrating words, I agree with what he actually wanted to say, that this movie is trash. UTTER TRASH!",

            "content": "In a land far away from the tyranny of oppressors in Mahishmati, a young boy once again prepares to scale the cascading waterfalls that tower over his home. These falls possibly lead to a land unknown to his folk, thus his mother's concern over her adopted child's obsession to explore. Years later, the grown man obsessively pursues his imagination of a fair maiden through the far reaches of the mountain's daunting elevations, only to end up in a kingdom that needed saving. Little did he know of his past and the implications of his return to Mahishmati, that has been under the rule of a terrorizing King, who in turn had wrongfully made it to the throne but the young man who grew up as Shivudu, must embrace his original identity and claim succession to the throne as Baahubali. The much acclaimed telugu film director S.S. Rajamouli brings us the first of two chapters of an epic that draws inspiration from the likes of Mahabharat. There is no doubt whatsoever that this is the benchmark for films of epic nature in Indian cinema. Once you get past the romance and character intros, you will be in awe of the sheer magnitude of Rajamouli's imaginative storytelling that takes you back to the glorious years of Mahishmati when a young prince rose to greatness. \n\n\tShivudu (Prabhas) grows up with his adoptive family at the foot of the daunting mountains and his curiosity for the world above leads him up top after repeated attempts since his childhood. The beauty and lure of its people, specifically Avanthika (Tamannah) keeps him intrigued and he soon discovers that she is a part of a rebel company that plans on rescuing former Queen Devasena (Anuskha Shetty) from the clutches of the evil King Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubatti). The mysteriously faithful Katappa (Satyaraj) honors the king with the erection of a grand statue that is a cause for celebration for the pompous king. However, Shivudu's timely appearance creates a furor among the slaves of Mahishmati and apprehension among the royalty. Soon enough, he attempts a daring rescue of Devasena, only to be pursued by Katappa's men and in a streak of violence, beheads the young prince of Bhallaladeva. Witnessing a familiar indomitable warrior spirit before him, Katappa realizes that Shivudu is none other than the son of Amarendra Baahubali.\nThe film turns into epic mode in the flashback that relates to the dynamics between cousins Amarendra and Bhallaladeva. While they had mutual respect and admiration for each other, Bhallaladeva's father always sowed the seeds of jealousy and insecurity in him. The result was competitiveness in the battlefield against a common enemy that was at their gates, threatening the very existence of Mahishmati. The Kalakeya army is a menacing creation by the film-makers and with their own language, they are almost as intimidating as the Uruk-hai. This epic battle is what makes Baahubali the 540 crore smashing masterpiece that it is. There may be inspirations from other big battle sequences from Hollywood but most of the sequences are unique in conception and flawless in execution. Make no mistake, this is Indian cinema at its remarkable best. Sivagami (Ramya) has promised the throne to the one who kills the enemy's leader and the people's favorite Baahubali will have to prove that he is more than just a warrior. \n\n\tPrabhas' efforts in adapting to the characters of Shivudu and Baahubali have resulted in him not only looking like the mighty warrior but his understanding of their back-stories makes him a credible protagonist. The range of emotions, his demeanor as the young Prince and his learned skills in the battle work brilliantly together for a solid, heroic performance. Rana Daggubatti makes a malicious villain and in a movie of this scale, the antagonist must seem more powerful than the hero. Rana's brawn and cunning lend credibility to the negative character that will hopefully play an even bigger role in the conclusion. Anuskha Shetty and Ramya are excellent in their roles of the strong women in an otherwise male-dominated film. Tamannah looks gorgeous as the rebel Avanthika and has executed some fighting skills competently. \nKattappa is possibly everyone's favorite character owing to his loyalty and mysterious allegiance to Bhallaladeva. The climax puts him in the spotlight of discussions after the movie and his grey character is just an exemplary portrayal by the much accomplished, Satyaraj. \n\nVijayendra Prasad's story and Rajamouli's screenplay make an intriguing epic. Although it has drawn some inspiration from the Mahabharata in terms of the family rivalry, it holds its own depth and engagement for the viewer. The final twist is exciting enough to justify mass hysteria for the second installment. Barring some of the banal love saga, the film offers few loose ends. Although the numerous songs certainly slacken the pace of an otherwise tight screenplay. \nThe production and art design are very detailed and the use of visual effects to depict the city only make things more credible for the period film. The intricate costumes and weapons match the epic look of each scene and this level of commitment by the film-makers reminds us of none other than Peter Jackson. \n\n\tIn a feat never before achieved by native cinema, Rajamouli will pull off another huge success when the conclusion of this tale releases in theaters next year. Fans will be eagerly awaiting more revelation of the plot line as well as big battles. Baahubali: The Beginning makes a huge impression for viewers of hindi cinema who would normally typecast their counterparts from the south. Unanimously, people have concluded that this is a grand representation of the best of Indian cinema, rather than of a particular language or territory. You owe it a viewing just for that.\n\n9.213 on a scale of 1-10.",

I appreciate the guts of the producers of Bahubali in supporting SS Rajamouli the director in making his script a reality. The graphics and stunts, especially the war scenes were fantastic, realistic and hard hitting! Proud that these are made in India and hope it inspires a new breed of producers to shell out hard cash for the sake of perfection. Bahubali proves that the audience appreciates perfection and will not let you down at the box office.\nThe casting and the acting was amazing. Starting with Ramya Krishnan, Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Nazar etc the entire cast fit into their role perfectly and gave a stellar performance. But the actor that really stole the show was Sathyaraj!!! I didnt realize it was him till half way through the movie!!!! The actors that didnt impress me much were Rohini and Tamannah. Tamannah somehow lacked the punch to carry an action role on her shoulders and would have worked better in the role of a damsel in distress.\nSabu Cyril - the art director from Kerala (of Yoddha fame) deserves special mention in erecting a grandiose set to match the epic panorama. He brings to life an era of Indian history with panache! Never before has this era been recreated with such authenticity and imagination. No, not in the Mahabharathas or the Ramayans of the Doordarshan glory days. Not in the other historicals that we have seen being shelled out from Bollywood. Hats off to Sabu Cyril.\nThe war scenes were not a rip off from Hollywood. It was spiced with original Indian guile and tricks bringing an authentic touch to it. The way the two princes led their troops to attack the enemy was a sight for sore eyes. The villains appeared menacing and original. Loved the sound of their evil fictional toungue!!! lol!\nThe music of the movie was good. Hummable songs.\nFinally, most of the accolades fall at the feet of the director - S.S.Rajamouli.

Outstanding screen presence by all leading characters leaves one glued to their seats. I find the songs and their timings silly at lot of places, but the scale and visuals of the director's vision are brought together by reasonably well composited CG imagery. Considering this is the first epic of this proportion in recent times, a very good construction of storyline,visual, screen characters and VFX. I would definitely like to see this as a plus to VFX. If you haven't seen this one watch it.. It isn't great but worth the buck!",

            "content": "I managed to catch Bahubali on a dim and cloudy Sunday noon and it was nothing short of being a spectacularly shot, splendid piece of cinema I had ever seen come out of the Indian barracks for a long, long, effin' long time. Many have tried to create a sense of an epic saga in their directorial ventures like Asoka, Jodha Akbar, Ra.One, Krrish, Drona, but the only ones that are really memorable are Mughal-e-Azam, Magadheera, and the current sensation Bahubali. \n\nThis Indian epic costing an insane $40 million is actually a humble offering when compared to its' Hollywood blockbusters' budgets which cost upwards of $200 million to create, with a major chunk of it being taken for creation of VFX and mega stars. On that note, it is really very unfair to compare the quality of the VFX to the Hollywood VFX heavy fare. \n\nThe scale at which Bahubali dishes out its' offerings is magnanimous and humbles every film yet made in India. However, it is only fair to judge a film against every other film on the planet because the paradigm of emotions does not end at the nations' borders. So, I wont defend Bahubalis' weaknesses because it was made at such a scale in India, the likes of which were never seen before, as it is not fair to the film paraphernalia. \n\nThe film begins with the heroic rescue of our Herculean hero, Shivudu, by her stoic and just aunt Sivagami, who lives by her book of principles even if they don't favor her own son, Bhallaldeva, who lacks the compassion and kindness that his cousin, and our heros' father, Bahubali has. Both are ferocious leaders with tree trunks for hulking biceps and a sprawling yard for their wide chests. They battle mighty bulls and fell gigantic boulders and lift golden statues of a few metric tonnes by themselves. The suspension of disbelief is too massive and yet, it feels real because of the empire and the universe that is created by Rajamouli. We see it all and lap it up like a kitten hungry for a morsel after not being fed for a couple of days. Such is the hunger for an epic story in our culture, that we have always wanted characters of lore that rival Game of Thrones, Lord of The Rings, 300 and the like. There are obvious influences of these films in our very own Bahubali which doffs a hat at their references instead of being blatant ripoffs. In fact, if you are a gaming buff, you might also notice Bahubali using a lion head as a boxing gauntlet just like Kratos from 'God of War' does, and boy does it deliver the charms and make a viewer like me grin with glee. \n\nThe story arcs in a very simplistic manner, regularly revealing newer characters and their stories and how they all connect to Shivudus' saga. The first hour or so introduces Shivudu and his iron will to climb the trecherous and dangerous waterfall mountain in one of the most beautifully shot parts of the film. Aesthetically picturesque, the waterfall symbolifies the grit of Shivudu and the eventual path that his destiny will take. He slips and he falls, but continues to reach higher and higher up the journey to the top, until he reaches a particular checkpoint where he seems to have come to a standstill as he keeps failing multiple times. He gets help in the form of a fantasy of a beautiful maiden who leads him higher and higher till he scales the waterfall finally. His climb in particular, takes its' sweet time including a song sequence with the aforementioned maiden, but you never feel bored by it because it is all just so beautiful to look at, and you are captivated in awe and are perhaps even jealous of not having seen something like that in your own life. This concludes with the introduction of the real life maiden, but she is nothing like our hero has imagined her to be. She is a ruthless warrior, a heroine in her own might. This initiates their love story, which is literally, my only gripe with the movie. He follows her and stalks her in ways that just don't justify their means. This culminates in a sequence which feels very rape-y where he undresses her in a way to show her, how beautiful she is, and this concludes the heroines' part in the movie, when he tells her that he loves her, and that every problem that she has, are now his. This is a perfectly missed opportunity to show that a heroine could be much more than just the heros' love interest. A lot could be learnt for the story team of Bahubali, if they were to watch a film like Mad Max, where Furiosas' plot ranks higher than Max' and Max is just happy to tag along and star in her story. The spoils in such a story, and hero, are so much richer, not because it is feminist, but because it feels fair and not enforced. \n\nFrom Devasena - Shivus' mother, Katappa - the honest and brave army general, Bhallal - the antagonist, Sivagami - Bhallals' mother, everyone delivers a credible performance and stay quite memorable. The film ends with a cliffhanger that serves like a good continuation point for the sequel to begin with. It will hit the ground running and hopefully has a tighter, more crispy script. I enjoyed the film more than what the ticket was worth and I hope that other filmmakers and producers dare to create original content for such blockbusters, the likes of which, the Indian audiences can only hope for seeing from the American shores currently. \n\nThe Indian cinema has seen a new wave of independant film making in the past 3 years and it is now the prerogative of the more financially muscular producers to sink their nails into content rich cinema and take a few risks along the way, instead of delivering the tried and tested, age old formulaic masala films. Thanks to Bahubali, it can also be said that grandiose cinema of this scale too, can have its' share of masala fare, after all, there even was a preposterous 'triple-item' song (very unrequired) that takes place in medieval Singapore (Singapuram). Makers of Bollywood cinema, this is my request to you, to aim for higher peaks, and climb against the push of the waterfalls and risk falling below, only to rise higher, the each subsequent time. Deliver us from the evil of star driven powered vehicles with hollow plots, that are gas inducing to even their hairbrained audiences. \n\nBecause, when you bail us out of that kind of cinema and usher us into more content driven and story rich environment, we will, very lovingly lift you onto our shoulders and carry you over to the base of the waterfall, where the 100, 200, 300, 400 crore clubs dwell, but don't have much meaning, because somethings in life are special, and you only know it, once you've made it.",

During the movie we do feel amazed with the visual treat of larger than life sets, palaces, the mountains, snow, avalanche- all this looks pretty real. \n\nA special mention for the waterfall scene which is romantically outstanding.\n\nThe story moves at a fast pace and does keep you engaged for most part of the movie. However it does not take a lot of time to draw similarity between this movie and an old Hindi Movie Karan Arjun. A mother waiting for her son (not sons) to come back from the dead to free her, take revenge and also take the kingdom back from his uncle. The only difference (& I must say it succeeds) is the treatment of the story - excellent.\n\nThe emotions, expressions, stunts, fights are all as usual loud but somehow you start ignoring these things due to the visual treat that comes along with it.

While I didn't think the movie was as great as others did I still feel that bahubali is a really good fantasy epic with an engaging tale,excellent presentation and really good acting from the whole cast. I was really impressed with the directors vision and the way he executed it. I was expecting the battle scenes to be unimpressive in the third act after seeing Lord of the Rings etc but to my surprise there were some unique and epic moments. The opening of the film was superb and immediately grabbed my attention and from then on it had my attention completely except for the useless songs which hampered the pace of the movie and also when I was taken out of the movie by the constant reminder that CGI was used for the animal sequences. This was really annoying but I can't fault the film makers as the censor board in india forced them to add this. The CGI was decent for the most part but they could have improved it by spending the money kept aside for the unnecessary song sequences. The stunts were really good but the scene where Prabhas jumps from one side of the waterfall to the other side could have been made more realistic by having the tree branch closer to him. Seeing him fly in the air for 4-5secs took me out of the movie once again. The jump felt extremely unbelievable even more so than him carrying the lingam statue. On the whole Bahubali is extremely entertaining and watching the director's vision unfold on screen is a treat but it could have been better with minor tweaks to some scenes,removal of unnecessary songs and better dialogues as some of the dialogues were really cringeworthy. The movie ended on a solid cliffhanger and I can't wait for part 2 next year. B",

Though it is truly an ambitious project with some set pieces never before put up in Indian cinema history, Baahubali still wears the scars of the limitation of budgets, the cliched romance and the unnecessary songs. The CGI works best where the director invests in it. The rest feels like a video game or worse. Rajamouli draws inspiration from LOTR, Avatar, Mahabharata but yet manages to give an original story which is commendable. However, it would be many years before Indian cinema rises up to the occasion and Baahubali might be its baby step. There are high moments like the beginning of the battle and certain shots at the humongous waterfall along with a very suspenseful conclusion to this part. It is decent overall but there are miles to go.",

            "content": "story: evil forces and the godly forces are the two prime elements of any world or any story. \"Baahubali - The Beginning\" has also got a story that comes under the same route. Inspired from the great Indian epics like Ramayana and MahaBharatham. But since this is the beginning, it gives us the taste of evilness and introduces the power which can kill it. \nActing Performances: Prabhas has got to perform two different roles one as a tribal boy \"shivudu\" and the other is the title role\"Aamarendra Baahubali\". He justified it 100% in each frame. Rana as bhallaladeva has got the character with a negative role and he stands out with his terrific performance and vibrant dialogue delivery (perfectly fit for villain role). Hope he does more movies of such performance. Anushka as devasena has got less screen space to perform but she justified the role and her look surprises everyone. Tamannaah has got a comlete different role she will shock everyone as a warrior who tries to save devasena from Bhallaladeva who prison-ed her for 25 years. satyaraj as \"katappa\" and ramya krishna as \"shivagami\" are the roles which actually gave strength to this story be with their role or performance. This is best character she has got after the nelambari in narasimha. Nazar as usually gave his best as disabled man. Sudeep kicha as aslam khan reminds me the character \"sher khan\" from magadheera. Prabhakar has got a very special character and his unique language and violence is menacing. All the others( rohini, tanikella bharani, and the rebel leader) perfectly justified their roles. \nMusic: MM keravani this time time couldn't satisfy all the sections of people with his songs unlike other rajamouli movies but the back ground score which he had given should be given a special mention. It stands out which actually gave a grip to the narration and it had hollywood flavor. \nTechnical Department: (Story, screenplay and direction). \nThis movie has routine simple revenge story and predictable screenplay but the director made sure that audience doesn't get bored by narration except in few scenes like unnecessary special song and screenplay in first half should have been more brisk. He made sure that heroic character and villain character elevated properly which he usually does in all his movies. Action scenes were directed fantastically, those were like never before in Indian cinema. The movie was made on humongous budget of 250 crores and each and every penny is clearly visible when you watch the movie. \nBe it the war scene or water fall sequences or the 40 mins war sequence or the unveiling of characters baahubali, kattappa, devasena and bhallaladeva they were extremely good and these catch the audience pulse, they have got hollywood flavor. But the emotional content was not upto the mark of rajamouli's capacity. other than that this movie is technically the best in Indian cinema. \nOther Departments: sets by sabu cyril is the key for this movie. He deserves an award for his brilliant work without which there is no baahubali to praise. Coming to cinematography senthil has captured those huge sets and showcased it in a beautiful way and the graphics made them look much more beautiful. As said mmk's bgm is an asset. Costumes were outstanding. Action sequences by peter hein's gave the hollywood standard to this movie. It was like never before and never after in indian cinema while watching. One should praise the producers for daring take up this project and support the rajamouli by giving such huge budget and letting him project his dream world on big screen. Thanks to Shobu yarlagadda and prasad devineni. \nAnalysis: \nOn a whole baahubali is a movie to go and watch on bigger screen to get thrilled with it's visuals and bgm. but the only disappointment is it's week screenplay in first half. Hope rajamouli comes out with much better second part. But for now this has completely justified the tagline \"The Beginning\" and we can proudly say this is our very own indian cinema in hollywood standards. If you haven't watched still go and watch it on big screen if possible in qube digital. Kindly don't encourage piracy",

            "content": "I don't get to watch much Telugu movies, until a couple of years back I got to check two of the most compelling films ever: 1 - Nenokkadine & Eega (also known as Makkhi meaning Fly). Director Rajamouli is the man behind Eega, story of a man who is reborn as a fly to take revenge from the people who killed him. I know that sounds redicolous, but hell the movie is one enjoyable feat! This time he is back with Karan Johar presenting the Hindi version of a film which is touted as India's most expensive film at a budget of 250 Crores (USD 25 Million). This 1st installment of a two part series is not not the answer to 300, Gladiator or The Lord of The Rings because saying so would be foolish. Don't compare this movie to the Hollywood ones because we still have a long way to go, its not the Indian 300, its the Indian \"Baahubali\". This film should be set as the benchmark for story telling, visuals & production. The quality of graphics is insane for such a cheap price given that Hollywood uses big budget for the same. The battle sequence is great and reminded me of the finale battle in Return of the King (Lord of the Rings series). Director SS Rajamouli has made something that we can be proud of. Judging by the trailer, I was sure that the VFX would be good however I had a doubt about the plot! And as expected the story was a run of the mill brothers fighting to take become the Kingdom's heir. But without doubt its Director SS Rajamouli's execution which makes this film a must watch! He took a big risk and made it big. This is what we need, good quality cinema. Salman Khan's fans should learn something from it. The story follows Shivudu (Prabhas) born with some skeptical amaze worthy skills & raised on tribal standards who falls in love with Avanthika (Tamannaah), a member of a rebel group fighting against the ruler Bhalla Dev (Rana Daggubati)  a kingdom named \"Magizhmathi\". In order to free Avanthika from her debt, Shivudu is tasked with rescuing a mystery woman Devasena (Anushka Shetty). On rescuing her from the kingdom, he finds out his the sole heir of the fallen king Baahubali (Prabhas). Raised by Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan), the two princes Baahubali & Palvaadelvan would win the crown & the right to rule once they prove their traits as the noblest, wittiest, strongest, wisest, and mightiest at the end of a major war against one of the strong kingdoms led by a Kalakeya War Lord (Prabhakar). While the first half sets up the film, the second half leaves your jaw on the ground. The war sequence is one best scenes ever to been seen on a Indian screen ever. The war sequences are easily best ones seen till now on Indian screens. Yes! Plot wise the film is pretty standard & predictable, yet the despite its minuses the film rises against its odds, well most of the time. Especially the appearance of an item song (also a standard now days in Indian films) which is kinda absurd, even certain sections of the first half (especially the love story) seem dragged & can be easily done away with.  The movie is definitely a huge production with its magnificent sets, promising VFX, thousands of junior artists, costumes, make-up, weapons. Though the project is touted to be the most expensive motion picture in the history of Indian cinema it had places in the first half where it was over dosed with CG and VFX making it looking like animation picture rather motion picture. Sabu Cyril as the art designer has really put a huge effort to bring out SSR's vision. Cinematography by KK Senthikumar has definitely elevated us to the historical feel. Hats off to the CG team for finally taking Indian cinema to the next level in VFX. With an ensemble cast Bahubali definitely scores well in the casting department. Note worthy performances delivered by three legendary actors (Ramya Krishnan, Sathy Raj, Nasser) in south Indian cinema. Ramya Krishnan as Sivagami fitted picture perfect to the role with her voice, walk and attitude. Sathyraj as Kattapa the sincere chief brigade of battalion has lived the role. Nasser as Pingala Devan a notorious villain inside the royal family has done 100% justice to the role. These three people are the supporting pillars for the movie. Coming to the leads Prabhas as the Bahubali/ Shivu and Rana as Palvaal Devan has put lots of effort to essay their massive historical characters. Rana seemed more convincing in the first half and Prabhas in the second half. Anushka as Devasena is hardly there, expectedly she has a more meatier role in the 2nd installment. Tamannaah Bhatia looks gorgeous & does her part convincingly. On the whole, 'Baahubali: The Beginning', is a big, sweeping epic that runs for close to 2 hours and 40 minutes. Spanning generations, going back and forth between the present and the past, alternating between vastly contrasting landscapes, it's an ambitious work from a visionary filmmaker who skillfully blends a tale of old school palace politics with modern VFX to deliver a consistently watchable blockbuster. Just cant wait to watch the second installment 'Baahubali: The Conclusion'.",

Movie is typical southie movie with over acting, cliches and heavy dialogues - and oh ofcourse, rajni style super hero strengths. Once you get past that, you thoroughly enjoy the movie. Lady who plays rajmata has acted really well and her screen presence is felt through out the second half of the movie. Go watch it on big screen, won't be disappointed.

The genius behind such a classic is SS Rajmouli, his resume speaks for itself, but with this film he has proved that he is India's best director, and the true answer to Hollywood blockbusters like 300, and even films like the Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe films divulges in the fantasy genre. The films main plot is about to warring cousin brothers for the throne of a kingdom. While one brother becomes king he is soon killed. The film is then set in the 25 years later showing the kings  grandmother who is about to die, leaving the Kings son with village folk. Then kings son then grows up to become a strong warrior like man but knows nothing about his past. Will he become king, and discover his truth, will we find out who killed his father is what forms the rest of the plot.\n\nWhile the films story is predictable, until the climax, the films screenplay is tight, and engages till the end. The first half sets up the film, while the second half leaves your jaw on the ground. The war sequence is one best scenes ever to been seen on a Indian screen ever. The action is best to be seen on the Indian screen ever.  Finally the films climax will leave you stunned, and one just cant wait for part 2.\n\nActing wise Prahbas and Rana have given performances of a lifetime as hero and villain they leave you in awe in the kind of dedication they have given. Tamanna suprises with here action scenes and looks majestic. Anuskha is first rate. Nassar is great. But Saytharaj steals the shows with his amazing act, he lives the role of Kattapa. Ramaya Krishna is excellent.\n\nOverall words cant describe this epic, its need to be seen to believed. Its India's best technically made film. The VFX, the action, the scale is the best ever seen on the Indian screen. Its truly pathbreaking.Indian cinema will now be know as before and after Baahubali. Take a bow SS Rajmouli we can see what took 3 years to make!!!\n\n5/5* or 10/10",

An incredible epic fantasy adventure film that couldn't be made in near future. ?Prabhas?, ?Rana?, ??Tamannaah? made acting look so easy.

It's strange to watch such an obviously expensive film come across so amiturish. \n\nBollywood has got to stop having their actors react to situations w/ cartoonish expressions and lines. It takes the viewer right out of the story and feels more like a play than a film. It's like they write so there's an excuse for people to randomly break out in a dance. Every film...same thing. Stop the dancing, fake reactions and sub par acting. It comes across as insincerity and forces the audience to roll their eyes. \n\nBollywood has come a long way in the past 5 years. Every film has moments of brilliance, but only moments.",
