            "content": "We started with a simple hello and ended with a complicated goodbye \nThe first half of the Hachi movie is happy to watch but the second half of the Hachi movie is sad which made me emotional at times. What a loyal, loving and devoted dog Hachi was to his owner. After the death of Hachi owner, the family should have tried harder to build a relationship with Hachi to get his love and devotion. The wife of the owner supposedly went back to Subuya station 10 years later and saw Hachi sitting there looking old and still waiting. She could have taken Hachi with her when she left Subuya station to be with Hachi for the remaining days of Hachi life. But instead, she left Hachi at Subuya station and was not concerned what would happen to Hachi. I feel her actions were very selfish and uncaring. Hachi deserved to be loved again, even if it would be for a short period of time because of the love and loyalty Hachi had for his owner. The family should have taken Hachi to the funeral service and let Hachi smell a piece of clothing and shown a photograph of his owner for possible closure for Hachi that his owner died. What I find sad as a human being is from 1925 to 1932, people at Subuya train station mistreated Hachi. It wasn't until the story of Hachi was published in the newspaper that people started to care, provide food, and give attention to Hachi. During those 7 years this could have been when Hachi became sick with cancer and worms and his condition got worse over those 7 years. There was no one really close to Hachi during those years to see or be concerned about Hachi health. Regardless, Hachi would still walk to the Subuya station each day and wait in all types of weather conditions for his deceased owner even when Hachi was getting old. I could not imagine how much pain and loneliness Hachi may have felt after his owner died. I'm so glad Hachi was honoured with a statue of him, him and his owner together. If I could go back to the time period of Hachi from 1925 to 1935, I would have given Hachi a lot of affection, provided food, companionship and a permanent home. Hachi always be remembered over the world for the loving and loyal dog he was. Rest in peace Hachi. WHAt A DOG\n\nSHOULD HAVE.",

The movie does have some tropes that are familiar in this sort of heartfelt dog movie, but I still didn't mind them that much because I genuinely got invested in the characters. I probably would have called the movie unrealistic had it not been based on an actual story, which just blows my mind.

            "content": "The movie tells the story of a university professor Parker who picked up an Akita dog and named it â€˜Hachi'. As Hachi grew bigger, he sent the professor to the station in the morning and waited for the professor to go home with him in the evening. But unfortunate things happened. On that special day, the professor passed away due to myocardial infarction. Hachi did not wait for the professor. What is even more sad is that Hachi waited at the station every day for the next nine years until the professor came back until he died. Hachi, this is a name registered by love. It means extending to the sky and then landing on the earth.\n    Flashbacks, slow motions, long shots, the natural pursuit of depth-of-field shots, all the usual methods used in warm films are included in this movie. The storyline is simple and ordinary, the plot with obvious ups and downs is not the style of this movie, it seems like Listen to a story. The friends and family around me have seen this movie. It's not that I don't want to watch it, I dare not watch it, because I know I can't stop the tears when I watch it. It reminds me of my first dogâ€”Diandian, she is a Chihuahua. The pointed ears, brownish-yellow and white hairs blend well on her. On March 7th, 2017, she left us...but fortunately, she had no illnesses in her life, just because she was old. But every time we think of her leaving, our family will feel sad. Although the story of Diandian is different from Hachi, every time I see a movie about dogs, I think of the days when Diandian is still there. I will never forget her, no matter how long it has passed.\nA scene in the movie impressed me:\nParker and his friend Ken discussed why Hachi didn't pick up the ball.\nParker complained to Ken that Hachi did not want to pick up the ball.\nKen asked Parker: \"Why does the dog pick you up the ball?\"\nParker was a little dazed, and said some reasons indiscriminately, for the cookies, for the fun, to make him happy.\nKen said: \"Akita dog does not like to please humans, except for some special reasons, he will not pick up the ball.\"\nEveryone who has seen this scene said that Hachi foresaw Parker's death. Perhaps this understanding is correct, but I have a different opinion. Looking at it in connection with the previous shots, Hachi is actually just lonely, eager for the company of his master, and doesn't want the master to leave. Human beings have their own family, career, and ideals. For Parker, he needs to go to work, he needs to accompany his family, Hachi is just a small episode in his life, a small corner in his heart. But for Hachi, Parker is its world. \nGood morning, Hachi. Good night, Hachi.",

As a dog person I was actually quite upset that everyone pitied and admired Hachi, but no one really provided for him beyond a bite of a hot dog?

The film is so touching, heartbreaking, realistic, believable and tearjerker that it is impossible to watch a devoted dog waiting for its owner without tears.

Hallstrom transformed the 1930s Japanese true story into a contemporary New England film that easily fulfills that soft spot in your heart. HallstrÃƒÂ¶mÃ¢(TM)s effective film uses several visual techniques Ã¢\" dogÃ¢(TM)s eye-view black-and-white footage, sped-up time frames Ã¢\" to tell the moving tale of great love and respect between college professor Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) and the puppy he rescues on a snowy night. This is a very simple and easy film that quickly engages the audience as it introduces a loyal dog, a man with a loving heart, and a happy yet sappy setting. The relationship of Hachi and Parker intensifies emotions that will surely pull at your heartstrings, which carries throughout the whole film all the way to its bittersweet conclusion. Hachi : A DogÃ¢(TM)s Tale is sensitively directed and over-sentimental,  and will likely ravish the emotions of dog lovers. Yet the film is as much about the emotional fallout of the death of Parker Wilson as about a muttÃ¢(TM)s unconditional love, loyalty and devotion. You might resent being emotionally manipulated by this film, but I challenge even the most hard-hearted moviegoer not to spill some saltwater while watching it. As a dog owner, I must confess to having had a large lump in the throat and a constant smile throughout. Hachi: A DogÃ¢(TM)s Tale is a great, big lick to the face, and a welcomed one at that.",

It is a drama/familiar movie that takes place in Japan. \n\nTha actors and actresses we can see in the movie are Richard Gere as Parker Wilson, Joan Allen as Cate Wilson, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Ken and Sarah Roemer as Andy Wilson. All of these actors and actresses are well known and have won at least one award. I think that they all were good at their performance because that made everyone feel the movie.\n\nSo the movie is about a dog and his owner.Everyday the dog went to the train station with his owner and waited for him till he came back. But one day his owner died and the dog didn't know about it so he kept waiting for his owner to come back until one day he died too. I think this is a really good story because it is full of drama and sensitive moments.\n\nThe emotional effect that this movie causes is really huge, because it could be remembered as a very sentimental movie that causes many feelings on the spectators. \n\nIn my opinion this is a really good movie, It has received really good critics from the public for example, an 8,1 out of 10 in IMDb and 63% on Rotten Tomatoes. Personally I will give this movie an 8,5 out of 10. I think that this movie made people very happy because it had the results that everyone expected. I think people should see this movie because it has a really good quality and also it has a really beautiful message. In conclusion people should see this movie because it is really good in graphics and actors but it also leaves a beautiful message.",

The dog looks like it doesn't know what is happening, and is just there most of the time. Hachi is supposed to be a story that takes placed in 1920s and 1930s. This is modern day. I would have moved the film's score up a lot if the film wasn't inaccurate. The logic is weird. How does a dog get sent from Japan to the United States on airplane being unnoticed and survives. That dog would have freaked out. I am not giving this film a lower score because the story is actually a big gripping, and the fact that Hachi's point of view is different is great. I didn't like watching this film when I did, but still. I would recommend this film to anyone who is wanting to see the film.

            "content": "Hachi-My Hero \nHachi: A Dog's Tale is a very touching movie. Even though I have watched it many times, every time I watch, I am touched. The film focuses on a dog, Hachi, and his love for his master, Parker. Hachi uses his lifetime to guard and wait for Parker. He never changes his love, which is very rare in humans. His loyalty makes me feel so precious, and I was touched by his lifetime love for Parker too. \"Heroes\" have a different definition in everyone's mind. In children's mind, \"hero\" may be superman; for the people who love money, their \"hero\" may be Mr. Bill Gates; for me, Hachi is a hero. He showed me what a real hero looks like in the film. \nThe film firstly released in Japan in 2009. Its material from a true story happened in Japan in 1933. The film is directed by Lesser Halls. In the first part of the movie, the professor, Parker, met Hachi. Small Hachi grew up healthily, and established a close relation with Parker. Hachi would go to the station to drop Parker off and wait for him to come back every day. In the second part, Parker died, and Hachi still waited for him every day. At first, the people around Hachi found his behavior strange, but as Hachi kept going to station every day, people were touched by his loyalty and were willing to take care of him. There were even journalist who wrote his story, and made Hachi's heroic deeds spread to the world. People from all over the world sent money to look after Hachi. Hachi become a hero, but not everyone in real life is as lucky as Hachi is. There are many unknown heroes around us, they sacrifice for us every day but we are rarely grateful or recognize. \nParker's wife eventually recognized Hachi was a hero. Ten years after Parker's death, Kate went back to the little town they used to live. When she arrived at the station, she saw Hachi was there. She hugged Hachi and cried, which as if she found a close friend. In the beginning, Kate didn't like Hachi, and didn't want Parker to keep him. Unexpectedly, after 10 years, the dog she hated was the one who has insisted on waiting for her husband. She was moved in that moment, and outside of the film, I was very touched as well, because it is hard to keep doing one thing.\nThe background scene of the film help me get into that moment. The leaves on the trees, change from green to yellow, again change from yellow to green; from spring to winter; from sunrise to sunset; from birth to death; Hachi from young to old, but one thing, the love, can never change. If we miss a person, perhaps only for a period of time, but Hachi uses his whole life to miss a person, which left me inexplicably moved. I would love to have a person can love me like this. Hachi was not a millionaire, and he would not be a superman, but he did an amazing thing, which made him a hero. Loving a person is very easy, but it is not easy to always love a person as Hachi did. A true hero is someone who has a big goal and is willing to put it into practice. They are not afraid of failure, and not afraid of setbacks. They are those who still have a strong sense of purpose, hope, and courage in a difficult situation.\nYear after year, Hachi has been waiting for Parker until him died. The moment he closed his eyes; he saw Parker's smiling face, cried for him \"Hachi, Hachi, goodboy.\" Love is so simple, so pure and loyalty so enduring, which will melt a heart of stone. This film is suitable for all ages, strongly recommended. In the film, you can find the eternal pure love. People have decades of a lifetime, but a dog's life is only a decade. Hachi used his lifetime to love a person. The paths Hachi choose, rather than the powers he is graced with make him a hero. But, is not just him, there are a lot of super heroes all around us. As long as we understand the true meaning of hero, we will find them in real life. They have helped many people and brought many positive influences to our society like Hachi did.",

Its acting is good: Gere is very likable as are the supporting cast (maybe except Jason Alexander). The pacing for the storytelling is alright. It's only an hour and a half, and it doesn't feel very long (and it doesn't need to be). Its story is a touching one that knows how to make the audience believe the relation between Hachi and Parker.\n\nProbably the biggest criticism I have for the film is that it doesn't offer the audience anything more than the central relation. This can make the movie seem a bit bland and plotless. It's not until the second half that the drama gets more serious, and surprisingly more engaging. If it were not for this second half, this movie would likely be very forgettable, since I myself am not a dog owner (I'm sure dog owners will find more to cherish with this film), and I didn't find anything about the acting or the dialogues that stood out; they were just fine.\n\n\"Hachi\" is a well-done film that chooses to only focus on its central friendship without trying to be too complex. This can work against it sometimes, but its pacing and running time help it be a good enough film to watch.\n7.0/10",

Mit viel Eleganz (die man ihm in Slippern gar nicht zutraut) besetzt er Richard Gere in diesem Remake einer japanischen Legende. Hachiko, ein japanischer Akita-Hund holte sein Herrchen, einen Professor tÃ¤glich von der Bahn ab. Selbst als der Professor bereits verstorben war, wartete Hachiko tÃ¤glich am selben Platz. Schliesslich starb Hachiko auch an der Stelle. So das Vorbild dieses Films. Dem amerikanischen Musikprofessor Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) lÃ¤uft in seiner Kleinstadt ein Welpe zu. Kurzerhand nimmt er ihn mit nach Hause. Seine Frau Cate (Joan Allen) ist davon wenig begeistert. Eine Nacht darf der Welpe bleiben. Bald aber sieht sie ein, dass ihren Mann und den Hund, der ihn tÃ¤glich zum Bahnhof bringt und wieder abholt, ein unsichtbares Band verbindet. Ganz unmodern langsam erÃ¶ffnet der Film seine Betrachtungen um den Kummer eines Haustiers. Wer bricht an dieser Stelle in TrÃ¤nen aus? Wer langweilt sich angesichts matschiger Emotionen? Bei mir wars die erste Variante: Ich musste losheulen, denn HallstrÃ¶ms Film ist so aufrichtig und so - einfach schÃ¶n! mehr auf cinegeek.de",

Setting aside the fact that not one of the idiots who supposedly cared for this dog took it upon himself to make the dog a shelter, I want to say, \"Wake up world!\"  There is no \"mysterious\" union here; this was an ordinary dog doing an ordinary thing.  Akita's are fiercely loyal.  It was the human element that was gut wrenchingly noteworthy.  If owners of dogs really loved their dogs they would become more informed about what is necessary to take care of their dogs.  Had the owner been sickly, the dog would have picked up on that and resolved itself to a death situation when the owner failed to show up.  Yes, dogs are extremely perceptive.  However, since this was a sudden death and the owner had allowed this dog to be a crucial part of his daily routine, a perfect storm arose that left the dog confused and locked into a behavior pattern because he knew no different.  We all want to believe the dog was paying homage to his dead master when actually the dog was daily living out his perceived reality:  My master doesn't want to be with me today.\" This dog could have had a happy life bonding with his new family had the owners taken the dog to the dead body of his owner so that he could sniff him and draw the natural conclusion that animals draw.  Yes, he would have mourned the loss but he would have gotten over it and gone on with his life in a much less depressing way.  Shame on us for not becoming more educated about these poor creatures we mercilessly include in our lives for our own selfish reasons. \nIt was obvious that not one person involved with this movie knew the first thing about caring for, training, or even interacting with a dog.  Poorly acted, poorly written, poorly directed mess of a movie that did a true disservice to man's best friend.",

The film never received a theatrical release in the United States but it is not lacking in quality.  It is filled with enjoyable performances by Richard Gere, Joan Allen, Jason Alexander, and the three Akita dogs that play Hachi at three different ages.  The interactions between the actors and dogs never seem to be forced; in fact, the entire thing feels very natural, as if the dogs were raised by the actors themselves.  It is that rare family-friendly film that appeals to all ages, whether it is a child who loves watching the cute puppy or the parent who is moved by the loyalty of this dog.  Every dog owner will be cuddling a little closer with their pup after this one.  \"Hachi\" isn't a very well-known film but delivers the quality acting, tender emotions, and age-wide appropriateness that should make it a staple for every family.",

I'm also one to notice soundtracks, and the music in this film was perfect and definitely helped to bring out the emotions. Although I'm not sure if a non-dog lover would react in the same way, it's undeniably still a wonderful touching story of an unforgettable friendship.",

This film focusses more on a relationship between a teacher and his faithful dog Hachi but turns out to be a great film about the love they share for one another and the dedication the dog had in his friend/owner. It's a beautifully shot family film that will melt your heart. A sweet film for the whole family.",

This is one of those touching films that have more of a meaning other than, \"Oh that's super sad.\" Hachi the dog represents the loyalty and love he has for his master. One day a college professor (Gere) finds an abandoned puppy and brings him home. He at first looks to give the dog away, but soon grows super attached to him. Several years go by and Hachi (the dog) has grown accustomed to following the professor to his train in the morning and returning in the evening to await him when he returns from work. Unfortunately, one day the professor doesn't return because of a tragic event. Hachi still comes to the spot day after day for nine years. The human element of the movie is its weak point. I never great attached to the characters, but that isn't the real star of the film. You go in this watching the incredibly talented dog Hachi. Overall, this is a rent if this kind of movie floats your boat.",

This bond proceeds to remain undeniably strong even after the professor's death. In the last half hour of the movie the anguish of the plot begins to thicken as the faithful akita remains waiting for his owner to return. Hachi is undoubtedly the centre attraction for the film, with great acting by all involved. I challenge even the hardest of hearts to attempt not to weep towards the end of this film, even the bold faced reviewers who rated this poorly. Although unapologetically tear-enducing, this 1 and a half hour emotional journey is a must watch, expecially for dog-lovers.",
