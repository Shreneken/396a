The whole reason Holly is special in the books is that she is the First ever female LEP officer they have had. Part of the story is her dealing with discrimination and overcoming it.\n\nAs for their portrayal of Artemis... I can barely comment it was almost like they tried to make this character the opposite of the books portrayal. I suspect that the director of this film skimmed the first few pages, saw the line 'Artemis's search had begun two years previously when he first became interested in\nsurfing the Internet.' on page 12, and decided that Artemis should be an athletic person who likes Surfing....\nAbsolutely outrageous.",

It is equally heartbreaking to read reviews of parents who say, \"I don't know why these people are giving the movie such bad reviews. My kids loved it!\" You are doing a disservice to the incredible world that is Artemis Fowl by allowing them to think that oversimplification of a film is all there is. This is not a fair representation of the stories I grew up with and I canceled my Disney+ account because of it. Go read the books.",

Mulch is talking to human authorities about fairies, and Artemis Sr is the reason Artemis Jr begins searching for them? Butler is not of Eurasian descent but is of African descent. I'm fine with the director's decision in that regard, however, I disagree wholeheartedly with the decision to have him wear those horrendous blue contacts.  Furthermore, Butler is supposed to be athletically massive and jacked. Nonso Anozie is a great actor, but for all his size, he cuts a portly, unimposing figure.

It would put things into context and eliminate all the pointless dialogue. Well, it didn't. In fact, ALL it contained was pointless dialogue, and there was still no context. I read an online review saying someone must have based the screenplay on a wiki summary. I disagree. I think whoever wrote the screenplay read the series very carefully. He or she would have had to in order to make everything and everyone the exact opposite of what it is/they are. He or she would have to be very familiar with the whole series in order to make sure nothing accurate got into the movie. I watched this movie twice. The first time I got so annoyed that it took me two days to finish. It took everything interesting about the books, crumpled it up, ate it, and promptly threw it back up. I watched it a second time, all at once, as if I'd never read the books. The second time was worse. It is an objectively bad movie. The script was nonsense; there wasn't really a progression of events, just scenes put together; and there was little to no explanation of ANYTHING. To all those who never read the books and liked this movie: didn't you wonder why Holly spoke English even though her name was written in Gnomish on her helmet? Didn't you even wonder what Gnomish was?\nAs for the characters, they wrote Holly as a tantruming child instead of a level-headed officer. They made Butler the comedic relief instead of a strong and silent soldier. And Artemis...liked being outside. Kenneth had what was clearly a talented core cast (Ferdia, Lara, Nonso) and he did everything wrong with them. They barely had any screen time together, and in general. The Artemis Fowl books were made for movie adaptations. They have so much pointless dialogue, scenes that could easily be shortened or cut, and room for artistic interpretation that they are basically a filmmakers dream.

The fairies are twisted to be allies, while in the books they are Artemis' targets. Artemis' father is completely unnecessary as he is supposed to be dead in the books. And Artemis' mother, who has one of the best arcs and actions in the book, is tossed out, which weakens the family story even more. Josh Gad is one of the worst possible choices for Mulch, who loses all of his charm and sarcastic humour. Butler has snow white hair and eyes, which makes no sense and is very distracting. Foaly has no personality whatsoever and the other elves are scrapped entirely. Commander Root is no longer intimidating in the slightest, and is played by Judi Dench. JUDI. DENCH. ROOT IS A GUY AND A LARGE PART OF HIS STORY REVOLVES AROUND HIM BEING A GUY. The villain is plucked from the second movie, made to look and sound \"evil\" (which fails hilariously) and is thrown in. She then proceeds to do almost nothing except kidnap a single person. This means that Artemis is technically just as evil as her, and this is not helpful in making the villain seem threatening. A random infinity-gauntlet style object called the Aculos is added, and is completely random and ill-defined. Plot points from the second book are added to the mix and confuses as to which book the movie is trying to retell. \n        In summary, Artemis Fowl is an absolute dumpster fire of a film, disregarding everything that made the books great in the first place, and even though there is a setup for a sequel at the end of the movie, it won't be necessary. This movie joins Percy Jackson in the realm of god-awful book adaptations. 2/10, do not watch.",

Are film adaptations perfect? NEVER! There are far too many rich details in the literary arts to capture on screen... and so we accept compromise and change to narratives and characters either physical or behavioural, especially if it has some wider societal relevance. \nThat being said... WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL WERE THESE MORONS THINKING!? It's like they read the book and then thought... \"Yeah let's just change every single thing about it and not make casting decisions based on the characters but instead just randomly cast some popular names... apart from the lead character, let's cast the most generic white kid even if he can't act\".\n\nArtemis Fowl - Ill mannered 12 year old, misfit evil-genius, criminal mastermind who is searching for his missing father, has to care for his grief ridden mother, while also being responsible for replenishing the family fortune - \"Nah let's make him a soft, extremely mediocre, surfboarding normal kid who just has to have a bunch of memories flash up in random order... also let's make him nice so that kids everywhere can relate to being a good kid\"\n\nArtemis Fowl Sr - Missing presumed dead criminal mastermind turned legitimate eco-entrepreneur with Mrs Fowl driven mad by grief - \"Nah let's make him alive, kill Mrs Fowl, make him obsessed with fairy life and have Colin Farrell play him because he's a well known Irish actor. Oooh and let's have him be a misunderstood, misrepresented hero who has only ever done good in the world because kids need a role model\"\n\nButler - A purely professional bodyguard/butler, Butler's have always guarded Fowls, are trained from childhood in martial arts and are forbidden from revealing their names to their subjects. He is tall, bald, intimidating and fiercely loyal and will ONLY be referred to as Butler - \"Nah, let's say he takes offence at being called Butler [presumably because they chose to cast a black man and wanted to avoid the connotations of calling a black man a butler] and let's make him the most dull, uninteresting, unimpressive bodyguard you've ever seen... and let's give him grey hair and blue eyes for no real reason... oh and make his sister his niece\"\n\nCommander Root - A gruff, no-nonsense exterior with a heart of gold, Root is a badass old timer with a handlebar moustache, rosey cheeks, a constantly lit cigar and a \"get it done\" attitude. A military veteran among the fairy kind and someone that will still get dirty and scrap with the youngsters throughout the coming stories, Root is the epitome of 'old school hard' - \"Nah let's cast Dame Judy Dench\"...\n\nDAME JUDY F***ING DENCH! I agree that if you're going to change a character from their description, then Root is the character to do it with but WHAT?! The guy that played Butler would've made a waaaay better Root and then you could've called him BUTLER!\nJUDY CAN'T WALK! LET ALONE FIGHT! You want an example of an actor that does similar roles who would've been a casting choice that made sense? SIGOURNEY WEAVER!\n\nMulch Diggums - A fairy dwarf with a gruff voice and a nonchalance for flatulence - \"Nah let's make him a 'giant dwarf'... but let's also have him say that to actual dwarfs so that you know actual dwarfs exist in this universe... oh and let's have him be the film's narrator even though he's not actually been around for 3/4s of the story... oh and let's have Josh Gad play him because he's known for being gruff, dirty and unpleasant right?... oh and let's just make it seem like he's super super important even though he's a background character\"\n\nAND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE STORY! They took the first book... combined it KIND OF with the next 3 books... and over complicated EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of the story. You lose any coherence throughout the narrative, you have no hook and you get zero connection to the characters.\n\nJuliet who is Butler's sister/niece turns up randomly throughout the film... there's no real thought to it... just... here she is... now she's gone... here she is again!\nArtemis is portrayed as a dumb kid... zero evidence of the high IQ he has other than all of the other characters going,\n\"oh it's Artemis Fowl, SEND EVERYONE\".\nThe performances were bloody atrocious too! The main kid that played Artemis SUUUUCKED!\n\nIt's so incredibly bad that I legitimately wish someone could be fired for it. Is that bad to say? Yeah probably. FIRE KENNETH BRANAGH from all directing in the future. He literally butchered everything to do with what is among the greatest YA franchises ever written. \nAll that budget was clearly spent on VFX, rather than on actual script-writing. GAH!",

Had a unique idea and interesting world-building but personally, I prefer Rick Riordan. I think it's because of Eoin Colfer's writing style - short but that's only because the chapters are really long - that I never really got into the books. But while the Percy Jackson movies can still be enjoyed just fine if taken as standalone movies, the Artemis Fowl movie is an incoherent mess. Fans are guaranteed to be pissed at the characterisations whilst people who've never read the books will be confused as to why this good-natured kid is acting like a bad guy when the movie presents him as much more unambiguously heroic than in the first book. Hell, I suspected that something was amiss when it was announced an understandably grumpy-looking Judi Dench would be playing Commander Root. Wasn't it the whole point in the book that Holly was the first female LEPrecon officer? As for Artemis himself...this poor, poor child actor is clearly trying to make the character work but bad direction and a worse screenplay means that, if Disney bothers to release the movie on Blu-ray, we'll get a blurb referring to him as \"...the next Jake Lloyd\" which anybody who knows about his acting career is aware that that's not a compliment. The visuals? They're fine. It looks like a video game at times and other times downright terrifying but the hidden world does look decent. If you ask me, Josh Gad was the closest thing this movie had to a saving grace. He's not terrific and his attempts at doing a Batman impression are laughable at best but hey, nice to see that Olaf seems to be the only one aware that this movie is a textbook example of how NOT to adapt a beloved series. I even personally think this type of movie is outdated nowadays. This movie would be right at home in the 2000's and early 2010's when literature-based fantasy movies were at their prime but in 2020, I'd expect an Artemis Fowl adaptation to be a TV show. Yeah, I dunno, I ran out of legitimate reasons to complain and just decided \"you don't belong in this era of movies full of superheroes, live-action remakes and shared universes\". My point is, that Artemis Fowl is an absolutely horrendous adaptation that makes no sense neither as an adaptation nor on its own merits and is definitely one of Disney's largest misfires. Smart move banishing this movie that takes place around one big house to a streaming service so that families have something new to watch during this stay-at-home challenge that's been going on for months now. Leave your home and get sucked to a whole new world where you spend time in somebody else's home. Don't worry, guys, we'll make it through this pandemic.",

We've seen success with staying close to the book from films like Harry Potter, Hunger Games, and Holes, so why not continue that train and trust the audience is smart enough to fill in details without the movie directly explaining the problem so transparently.  The layers of character development in the book are replaced entirely with surface details fabricated for the characters. Here's an extreme example: In the book, Artemis Fowl is supposed to be pictured as a heartless, driven anti-hero, but we know he also has a weakness for his insane mother because of their interactions throughout the first book. In the movie, the mother is replaced with the missing father, and the mother has passed away! The film also took the opportunity to introduce Artemis Fowl's origin story before the real adventure begins, and that in itself left no imagination for the audience to decipher the situation themselves as the thrilling hunt for mythical creatures starts. I am especially disappointed with Holly's appearance and her relationship with Root. Her backstory and why she gets captured by Fowl changes too; instead of having to do the moon ritual on the surface, she disobeys orders and goes to search for her missing father. I could be wrong, but the author describes her with \"nut-brown\" skin, and there was controversy amongst fans about that for years after as she was depicted by fans, comic books, and then the film with much paler skin in comparison to nut-brown. Also, Root is a woman as well in the film.... it takes the whole dynamic of Holly being one of the few females in uniform away when the hard-ass boss is also a woman too. They never mention the gender problem in the film like they do in the book, which I guess is a sign of the times. Some could argue that showing sexism in a professional workforce setting like policing could be revealing to younger viewers that woman are looked down on in someway, when they should just be able to see that men and woman can work equally without any discrimination. However, I think getting rid of that in the film did just the opposite. It's not as if that doesn't exist anymore (discrimination based on race or gender) in real life, though we do not see it as often, so to just take that part out entirely also made it seem like Holly has nothing to prove (and she absolutely did). Her story could have been like that of Officer Hops, but instead with the change in backstory was just another character flushed out in this poor adaption. I'm not hating on the actors themselves, they all did relatively well with the material they were presented with. I just think the film Artemis Fowl is a perfect example of why you should stick closer to the source material. Even though the release was meant for just Disney Plus and not theaters, doesn't mean the movie could not have easily been a critically acclaimed film.",

In the book, Artemis' father knew nothing about the world of elves and other creatures, he was abducted by the Russian mafia, because he was an ordinary criminal, even though for Artemis he was infinitely dear as he is Artemis' father.",

But judging the movie here as an actual film, it is just flat-out terrible. It is so hollow, bland and erratically assembled! None of the characters have depth, any remote level of drama in the story is inept or forced, and so much of the plot is jumbled nonsense where one scene will immediately contradict the other. On a more technical level, this has some of the worst editing I have ever seen! A example being how one character will be in a room reading a book in the early evening and within less than 10 seconds is suddenly hiding in the forest at night in camouflage without even a a few shots transitioning that shows the character going from locale to the next. The \"action-scenes\" move way too fast or just look poorly-staged, on top that is some very atrocious CG creature effects. \n\n\nThat is a shame because the only positive I can find in this shit-show, aside from a couple fleetingly humorous moments, is the decent visual appeal of the underground fairy world. The fairies themselves are a sort of militarized version of the high-tech Elves from \"The Santa Clause\", which is at least fine if not still derivative. And there were some bits of the cinematography and Patrick Doyle's musical score that I liked; which is the least you can expect from the usual boisterous Kenneth Branagh production. But the biggest sin is not the wildly uneven filmmaking on display, not the insanely expository script or the painfully chaotic set-pieces but it is the movie as an \"book to film\" adaptation. Having not read the books, I did a wee bit of research after watching the movie to see what the books were all about and I can see why the fans of the books HATE this movie! As an adaptation, it is really an abomination; a heartbreaking failure that ruins the edgy appeal that made the source material incredibly unique and compelling, all to be neutered by a committee of execs. It was streamlined in order to appeal to an \"ADHD\" audience that become increasingly bombarded with media content and hoping they would like it enough to spawn a franchise. Don't let my score fool you because the movie pulled one decent pebble out a mangled bucket of flaming shit that is this \"movie\". - 2/10 (D-)",

You've done to Artemis Fowl what Fox did to Percy Jackson.  My only hope is that another studio will pick up the rights and make a better/closer adaptation for Artemis Fowl (and someday for Percy Jackson).

This film clearly did not have a script doctor, because any competent one would have fixed the glaring holes in this cavernous vacuum of originality and charm Disney pawned off as a screenplay in under a week. The editing and pacing is horrible, there are several glaring continuity errors and the title character must have studied under Hayden Christensen's \"Anakin Skywalker School of Acting\" for this, his debut role. \n\nDon't even consider turning on Artemis Fowl, you will be worse off for watching this absolute disaster.",

We open to Fowl surfing (the last thing you might imagine the book version of the character doing) and Josh Gad cosplaying as Hagrid with a Batman voice, and it doesn't get much better from there. Bad and/or plagiarized dialogue abounds. This film clearly had the weight of Disney's visual effects budget behind it, but apparently struggled making anything engaging beyond bright lights and loud noises. Some of the acting (particularly Shaw's) is terrible, the rules of the universe are either inconsistent or simply never established, and many of the costumes are unintentionally hilarious. Gad plays the same slightly offbeat, occasionally-fourth-wall-breaking funny man in literally every performance. Both Dench and Farrell are great performers, but both have shown a penchant for terrible roles in recent years. (1.5/5)",

When your dealing with magic and fairies then I would very surprised if a  big budget disney movie got the spectacle side of things wrong.\nAccompanying this is a very decent score, something I would listen to again rather than watch this again.\n\nThe bad parts are the story and the acting which unfortunately makes up 90% of the movie. Surely there was a better child actor than the one they got for Artemis, sorry but his wooden and uncomfortable performance was very disappointing. Judy Dench was cast completely wrong, yes she is a great actress but not right for her part.\n\nAny movie which has a narrator in my eyes is just lazy, and that's how this felt,  the story and plot are incredibly simple and lazy.",

            "content": "It's been too long since I've seen a new release with the current pandemic going on now. There's plenty of other movies I want to see as well, so you may be wondering why did I see this? Well I heard this film was awful, so for some reason I decided to give it a watch. Look I heard Artemis Fowl was bad, but oh my god. This is barely even a movie and upon doing my research and seeing that this film has been in development hell for the longest time, I can see why. Kenneth Branagh directed this and he's directed movies like one of the rare good Disney remakes, Cinderella, the underrated Thor, the masterful Hamlet, and so much more. He's a very talented filmmaker and actor, and he's certainly not the problem here. I've watched a lot of his films to know this film is just a rushed, disastrous, edited to shit film that was dumped to Disney+ because it's abundantly clear that Disney was completely lost with the making of this movie. That about wraps up my intro...now lets talk about this \"film\".\nAs I stated before, this film is incredibly awful in every single way. As a franchise starter it's so rushed, uninteresting, poorly executed, and way too short. This movie is only 95 minutes long with credits so there's that.....even though the movie felt like it was at least 2 hours. There is absolutely no characterization to anyone including our main protagonist, the title character. Artemis Fowl is just.....really smart. He's better than you, he's better than me, he's our hero. Why is he so smart? Screenwriting, that's why! Josh Gad plays a big dwarf, yes you read that correctly. A big dwarf. He narrates a majority of this movie in this very deep and raspy voice that had me actually cringe. The first 10 minutes of this film is entirely narration and exposition....uninteresting exposition. I'll get back to that later. Artemis Fowl II is portrayed by Ferdia Shaw and according to IMDb, this is his first role in a movie. I really don't want to say this but I have to, his performance was awful. His face looked so stiff and locked up every time he finished his lines and he failed miserably at being dramatic in some scenes. It was honestly embarrassing to watch and again I feel awful for the kid. Just imagine being as young as he is and getting hired by Disney of all companies and this being your first project. I hope he's able to have a successful career after this because I can tell this isn't all his fault, he just wasn't given good direction which in some scenes you can tell. Colin Farrell is also in the movie and he plays Artemis Fowl I and I read that he shot his ENTIRE performance in 3 days and there's not a part of me that doesn't believe that. It's very apparent that he didn't want to be in this movie, I wouldn't want to either. Aside from every character being uninteresting, and the acting being awful, let's discuss the story. There really isn't one. Even though this film is entirely all explaining, you don't care about what's happening. It's a basic throwaway macguffen plot that we've seen numerous times with this faceless villain who's pretty funny with how over acted the character is portrayed. The faceless villain (I forgot the characters name and don't care enough to look it up) captures Artemis Fowl I for this macguffen and now Artemis Fowl II and his butler must save him. There's also a fairy subplot that's just there, with hilariously bad acting and effects. But I'll say the fairy subplot was more interesting than the main one with our title character, that being said, it was still garbage. There's also some action scenes with hilariously bad CGI trolls that had me laughing out loud. They weren't threatening, interesting, or anything! I was so distracted by how bad the CGI on them was for a $125 million dollar movie that I didn't find myself caring about anything else. The story is lackluster and uninteresting, but also super boring. We're almost halfway through the movie when the first \"action scene\" occurs and it wasn't good at all. The effects and action scene's were filmed and edited to absolute shit. Holy crap, these scenes were so awful to look at and it was again, embarrassing with the way they were shot and edited. The editing and pacing in this movie as a whole is just garbage. Everything about this movie felt amateur in every way. There's even a sequel set up at the end.....LOL. \nBefore theaters shut down this year, I had watched some true crap like Brahms: The Boy 2, The Turning, Dolittle, The Grudge, and Fantasy Island. All of those movies are steaming piles of trash, but even in Fantasy Island was I able to reach in one thing I thought was actually somewhat praiseworthy in that movie. Same with Dolittle and even The Turning where nothing happens, there's even a suspenseful scene or two in that film. As for this one, there is nothing. I mean absolutely nothing I liked about it. I'm sure the books that this is based off of, primarily the first, are pretty good. About those books, if you're a fan of them, you will probably HATE this. They should've gutted this movie and started a fresh production because looking back at the first teaser trailer that was released over a year ago, there were maybe 2-3 shots in that entire teaser that were in the movie we got. It is THAT jumbled and messy. There's nothing more for me to say about this movie other than the fact that it earned the title of worst movie of the year so far for me. Artemis Fowl without a doubt, gets an F.",

When his father gets kidnapped, he must work with some friends to track down a magical acorn that will help to get him out... I don't know, your guess is as good as mine on this.  Now look, there's no beating around the bush on this one: if you have seen a trailer for this, then you know how bad this had the potential to be.  I realize that the novels to this are beloved, and I can't speak to them, as I have never found the time to take them in.  I can only speak to my experience with this movie, so I can say that Artemis Fowl as a film is an egregious Harry Potter knockoff that makes Percy Jackson look like an award contender.  Now I'm going to be candid with you on this: I can't tell you what was going on with the story in this.  Even after thirty minutes had passed, I was confused about what was happening or what direction this story was headed.  It is a bonafide mess that is just trying to get that Harry Potter money, and it is unapologetic in the way that it proceeds.  Ferdia Shaw is awful in the leading role, but I can't put too much of the blame on him.  He is just a child actor, and honestly, if this movie ever got to be popular, I'm sure he would be looking at a Jake Lloyd situation in that fans would hate him to the point that he would give up acting, even though it is not necessarily all his fault.  This movie just doesn't know how to develop characters or progress the plot, which is wild to me because veteran Kenneth Branagh is in the director's chair.  The lack of vision from him is what sinks this, and everything about Artemis Fowl just feels like it is a made-by-committee studio film that needed to go back to the drawing board before principal photography even began.  This is a giant mess, and if there is only one takeaway to be had, it is that Judi Dench needs to only come out for true Oscar-caliber films.  Between this and Cats, I'm sure she wished that she booked a vacation instead of listening to her agent.  If there is a saving grace to this, it would be Lara McDonnell as this soldier.  Out of the entire cast, she is the only one who feels like she did her homework with character depth, and whenever she is onscreen, I felt like there was a glimmer of hope in the background.  It's not a lot and it is barely a consolation prize, as this screenplay is trash, and this movie is about as messy as a big-budget studio production comes.",

It aims to be the stepping stone for an extended universe, but ends up looking and feeling like a prequel to a film we'll never get to see. There's a lot of potential, not to mention a lot of material to go off, but it was a bad decision to try cramming as much as physically possible into a 95-minute film. It would have been a much better idea to adapt the books into a TV series, where things don't have to happen so fast, and you can slow-drip the story and complex mythology. What we get instead is a hodgepodge of characters we never get to know and exposition we can barely follow. Characters talk about numerous things that are either never explained or never fleshed out. At one point a character mentions how something is against \u2018Fairy Law'. How does Fairy Law that work? How is it enforced? What laws are there? We don't know because the movie doesn't mention it again, it simply brought it up because it's an element of the lore. Josh Gad is the closest thing we get to an enjoyable character, but he's written as a painfully forced comic relief, who's job is to be brought into a situation and be \u2018quirky', which in this film translates as \u2018grating'. The acting is mostly flat, especially from our titular hero, who recites his lines as if he learned them phonetically, his voice lacking any real emotion or conviction. Much of the story revolves around magic, and the film completely fails to address or avoid the issues this presents. The Fairies are forbidden from being seen by the human. They have magic that allows them to stop time and heal people instantly, but not to make themselves invisible? It's a big, CGI-laden mess without a human touch, and I wouldn't have believed it was directed by Kenneth Branagh if his name hadn't been in the credits. It will be forgotten about pretty soon, only popping up in lists with titles like \u2018Most disappointing movies' and \u2018Most notorious big budget flops.' I can't say it doesn't fully deserve this fate.",
