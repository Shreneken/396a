    "summary": "This animated tale follows the relationship between the small human-like Oms and their much larger blue-skinned oppressors, the Draags, who rule the planet of Ygam. While the Draags have long kept Oms as illiterate pets, this hierarchy shifts after an Om boy becomes educated, thanks to a young female Draag. This leads to an Om rebellion, which weakens the Draag control over their race. Will the Oms and the Draags find a way to coexist? Or will they destroy each other?",

The concept of a higher life form living amongst human \"Oms\" is very interesting. Seeing these higher life forms treating humans like ants is fascinating to watch. The story is very engaging and keeps you locked in the whole time. It's paced to perfection and has a run time of only an hour and twelve minutes. The animation is very unique and cool to look at. Overall, it's a very unique and fascinating animated movie to watch that gets you thinking.",

So one human figuring out the aliens tech is like Nova from \"the Planet of the Apes\" figure out how a gun works.  Being psychedelic is no excuse for not having proper story structure.  \"Yellow Submarine\" was very psychedelic but you can follow the story.  This movie never bothers to explain anything.  None of the characters had any real development and like every French movie I've seen so far it's slow.  This one darn right boring.

Evoking a much earlier style but adding a fluidity that predecessors may have lacked, the film has a somewhat thematically simple narrative but thrives off of worldbuilding and creative detail, allowing viewers to take in an almost retrofuturistic take on science fiction. If there's a major criticism, it's the structure of the conflict between the film's two factions, which never seems to instill the gravitas in its combatants or the atmosphere as a whole that it likely should, though this may be due in part to the film's muted tone, again a throwback to earlier years. One of those films that you might have to go out of your way to watch, but one that everyone should see at least once. (3.5/5)",

So fucking weird and creepy. These aliens are so advanced that we humans are just play things to them. Almost like pets. I can't imagine living in a world like that where everything is so unknown. It'd be a nightmare. It's interesting to see how the Draags live and how they do their daily rituals like meditating and eating and learning and even getting high with friends. \n\nHmm. Interesting. The humans, or Oms in this world, are more savage than the Draags. I guess this is social commentary on our society and how we are as humans and how we need to evolve ourselves and reach a higher level of consciousness. It's also a social commentary on social classes - rich vs. poor. Pretty frightening some of the things that happen in this movie. It wasn't until the Oms started fucking with the way of living and their rituals, that the Draags decided to let them have their own satellite so they could live in peace. This movie teaches us that we must learn to coexist with one another no matter our backgrounds, skin color, ideology or whether rich or poor. \n\nMan, the music is so fucking good. Funky, groovy, haunting and eerie but also ethereal and otherworldly. It basically creates the whole vibe of the movie. The art style is very unique. The concepts for all the different creatures and plant life are very inventive and creative. Unlike any other movie out there, this movie stands on its own. Fantastic! I must own it",

            "content": "The world building of the planet Ygam is absolutely... fantastic! The more the film advances, the more I get to audiovisually explore this unique world, and consequently the more I became surprised every time I encounter an otherworldly technological invention that has been always in my head since my childhood, hoping they'd be realized someday. So, it's clear that watching this proved a fulfilling experience in regards of this aspect.\n\nOn the other hand, I can't say the same about exploring the premise of the film itself. Being in the animals' place and controlled by even more superior creatures is a concept that also has been in my head (probably because I encountered a lot of stray and abused animals when I was young), but this film didn't expand upon this idea enough to go beyond what I thought about. The only thing that I think redeemed Fantastic Planet in this aspect is that the facial expressions of the human characters (or should I say Oms) are uniquely and effortlessly expressive of how they perceive the treatment of the Draags which, in turn, reflect how we'd feel if we were put in the animals' place. But then again, this also is attributable to the technical competence of the crew, especially the animators. That's what I thought about the film until I realized I was only halfway through.\n\nAlthough it's still a bit of a let down for me, what really saved this from being a huge disappointment is the depth of the subtext. It's not until the second half that the plot begins to unravel. Here we finally find out that the surreal, hallucinatory imagery has in fact a surprising depth. Here the story finally begins to consider the Oms, enslaved, humiliated, helpless and inferior as they are, are human beings after all. Without going to any further detail to avoid spoiling anything, but this film tackles speciesism and social discrimination like no other film did. It's just a shame that it takes too long to establish its world building before getting into its message. As a result, anyone could easily mistake the film for being superficial watching only its overstretched first half, and as a consequence, the second half is too condensed for its own good, given how rich it is.\n\n(7.5/10)",

The Oms tries to get their freedom and there is a war going on between the two species. Who will win?\n\nThis film is all about letting your mind go and observe and digest the images. It's beautifully crafted. Great drawings, sweet creatures and imaginative like drugs where a must at the production and the result is an actual drug itself. For me the best part of the film was still the soundtrack done by Alain Goraguer. Trippy, soulful jazz - almost like triphop at times. Songs from this film has been sampled by loads of artists and it's easy to see (hear) why. The combination of dope music and extraordinary, sci-fi animation is superb - but even if the story is good too, I wanted even more. I missed some character development or some feelings towards a few characters. I felt like an observer, observing an entire society. \n\nIt's all right, but it feels like I missed out on many details that way and my attention fell at times. Still I would not have the lenght expanded. 70 minutes felt about right. I'm sure there is plenty of symbolism and metaphores here, but I don't get half of it.

Watch it if you want a short (60 min.) dose of psychedelic stop-motion animation, replete with imaginative alien species and a glimpse at humanity gone caveman. While the oppressed people group motif makes for interesting cinema, here it falls short due to its underdeveloped social dynamics. How does the protagonist feel about the Draags or his master in particular? Is he fully accepted by the other Oms? These depths are never explored. Instead, the storyline plods along, skipping a few plot points along the way, and then ends abruptly. The themes change abruptly too, moving from Bildungsroman to the clich\u00e9 \"oppressed people group fighting against oppressors\" motif. Even the protagonists' role changes midway as he himself becomes irrelevant to the plot. If the audience cared about him by this point, they would be wondering what happened to him-we're never told-but alas, the plotline is so flat, the emotion so sparse, that the audience hardly connects with him. The other Oms barely seem to connect with him either, for that matter. In short, watch it if you're looking for a memorable merge between fantastical sci-fi and stop-motion animation. If you want a glimpse at human complexity, look elsewhere.",

From my first go around at watching this movie, I found myself not really listening to the story line, as I was really drawn in by the drawing of the characters and the landscapes that were done. My first responds to this movie was that the creator where on something and couldn't really fathom what they had made.\nHowever the second attempt, made it more clear to me that this movie in my view was pretty much about  two opposing element fighting for control which target the human needs for destruction and inslavement. The animation in fantastic Planet made this message of the need for destruction and inslavement mor digestable by taking us to a faraway planet where blue giants rule, and oppressed humanoids rebel against the machine-like leaders. Pretty much taking a old idea and putting in a new perspective and I believe, had the creature of Fantastic Planet went any other way, other than cutout stop motion, would not given m\ne the same experience.",

Similar to human interaction with animals, some of the giants consider the humans pests (although acklonledging their high organizational skills), while some of these humans are kept as pets with collars and getting dressed up in ridiculous clothing. While this is just a micro allusion that the film makes, there's a lot of greater symbolism.\n\nThe two main themes I reached were oppression (through political systems) and knowledge (which is a tool to fight oppression). It's hard to say which system each life of our protagonist represent. When Terr was kept as a pet to the blue giants, he's like an object of the state. When the domesticated Terr goes into the wild, he joins a more communal system, but which still adores and relies on it's leaders. While it feels that the film is pointing towards the cold war in it's symbolism- space ships representing the scientific exploration for example- it's hard to make a distinction creating a capitalistic and communistic system. Perhaps the film shows they're closer to the same than they're given credit for. Regardless in both systems knowledge brings power, and in both systems it's oppressed.\n\nThe animation is very stoic, often leaving lots of blank space, and rarely fluid. There are many great \"sanpshots\" in the film, often showing creativity, and the images our interesting. But I can't say I'm overly impressed by the animation itself, simply since I've seen more appealing.\n\nThe film left me somewhat unaffected, it has some thought provoking spiritual and political under tones, but nothing that lasted.\u00c2\u00a0",

            "content": "In the distant future, humankind-now called the Ohm-struggle to live on a primitive planet dominated by an alien race known as the Draag.  After losing his mother to the aliens and being taken in by a Draag named Tiva, Terr adjusts to life as a pet under the roof of Tiva.  Years go by, Terr becomes more mature, and begins to gain knowledge that is unbeknownst to the rest of the surviving Ohm.  As Terr grows older, he escapes with a headset device that contains all of this knowledge and plans to distribute it to the surviving Ohm colonies.  As this is done, the Draag plan to exterminate the Ohm and it becomes up to the humans to fight back.\n\n     Being based on a novel by Stefan Wul and one of the three feature films directed by Rene Laloux, Fantastic Planet (Le Planete Sauvage) is a surreal, imaginative, and fantastic movie that does animated films of its genre much justice.  The story is mostly a political satire about social classes, class warfare, tyranny, and oppression.  Most people may notice that it bears an uncanny resemblance to stories like Battlefield Earth and The Borrowers.  Although, this book and movie came out before L. Ron Hubbard's Battlefield Earth, but the book was written in 1957.  Making it five years after Mary Norton's The Borrowers (1952).  \n\n     The imagery and animation style was produced in France and Czechoslovakia.  It is gorgeous, innovative, and surreal.  A lot of it reminds me of the Terry Gilliam animated segments in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Although, the style in which it is used does a superb job at creating a dark atmosphere for the story and conveying its symbolism.  The attention to detail is very well done and the designs of the aliens are great. \n\n     Most of the story is told through narration and inter-monologue of the main character, Terr.  The dialogue in the film is very well written and is one of those foreign animated films that is good either dubbed or subtitled.  The voice acting in this film is very top notch.  The characters all do a great job at conveying their personalities and give the viewer a sense of life.  \n\n     The music is also very great.  It consists of orchestrated piano music that is very memorable.  It also does a lot in benefiting the surreal and dark tone that is presented in the movie.\n\n     Overall, Fantastic Planet is a superbly directed, animated, and written movie that is enough to please any fan of sci-fi/fantasy animation.  This is a movie that I would recommend any fan of anime or Heavy Metal to watch.  This is one of those Western animated films that people like me love, but just don't see enough of from the West.  Laloux directed two other films like this one: Gandahar/ Light Years and Time Masters.  Neither of which I've seen, but after having seen this movie I'll be looking forward to that time.",

The best part of the film is witnessing the creativity of the animators through the wacky unusual creatures and sci-fi aesthetics. One of my favorite moments was a scene where a weird bat-like creature attacks the human colony and the humans have to take it down. The film also has a tasty avant-garde soundtrack that adds to the surreal vibe of the film. \n\nThis film was originally released on a double bill with 'Yellow Submarine', which was another counterculture film released under the guise of a children film. The plot boils down to a 'Planet of the Apes'-like story with a thinly-veiled Cold War undertone. While the animation steals the show, the story unfortunately never lives up to it's potential. The characters are simply boring, and the bland voice acting make the characters seem even more lifeless. Plus despite being an adult animated film, the plot ends up being simplistic-to-a-fault while the ending is a super-cliche \"can't we all just get along\" happy ending that seemed too good to be believable.\n\nThe animation alone makes the film worth seeing but don't expect the narrative to blow your mind.",

This is one of the most bizarre films I have ever seen, and oddly one of the best films overall that I have ever seen. Made in 1973, it has creepy animation that will be easily acceptable once you realize what you are in for, the voice acting is very impressive, the story is very original, and the conclusion will leave you smiling, if you followed everything that happened.

Between the outer-space setting, the bloopy synthesizer score, the fanciful creatures, the lava-lamp vistas, the emphasis on out-of-body meditation and a host of drug-like rituals, the film practically reeks of marijuana. Head-flick alert! See it with a giggling friend.\n\nAt its core, this animated French fable has a familiar theme of two rival tribes coming together as one. The giant Draags are slim, bald and blue, with bulging red eyes and fish-like features. They dominate over their planet's tiny humans (or \"Oms,\" as in \"hommes\"), either exterminating them like bugs or callously keeping them as childrens' pets (they easily fit in the palm of a Draag's hand). Eventually, an outsider sect of Oms challenges the Draags' rule, possibly dooming both populations. But what's most delightful is not the thin story, but all the whimsical, throwaway images that don't even contribute to the plot. One imagines the screenwriters brainstorming for random elements to add, suggesting \"Hey, about a scene with crystals?\" \"OK, but I have an idea for a monster!\" So many surreal snapshots that pop up just once and make a quick exit.\n\nThe dull color palette is a minus -- most of the scenery has a similar, salmon-colored tone -- but the one glaring flaw is an inexplicably rushed ending. After 70 minutes of graceful storytelling, the denouement feels like something tossed together on deadline. Wham bam, film over. What?",

It's an adventure story with a powerful message, a film but primitive and far more advanced than most live-action movies. Perhaps most amazing of all, the setting and characters have no connection to ours or us (although the Oms, admittedly, are perfectly human, physically). The story is concerned with a planet in which giant, blue creatures keep Oms (the human-like people aforementioned) as pets, controlling their environment, food, sleep patterns, clothing, etc. But a group of rebell Oms, of which our central Om eventually becomes a part of, decides to fight back, defending their civil rights and proving their equal intellect. It's a story that certainly has a point to deliver, but that message goes down easy and beautifully. In fact, the images it's delivered with are so beautiful that one digests the message almost distractedly.

            "content": "9.1/10\r\n\r\n              I once dreamed that I died and was reborn as a little blue child. I'm sure that dream wasn't brought on by those years watching \"The Smurfs\", or those times I've watched the recently released \"Avatar\", but perhaps something I hadn't experienced yet. \"Fantastic Planet\" happens to be the film that coincidentally reminds me of my dream- or in this case-nightmare. This piece of sheer hallucinogenic brilliance is some of the best French cinema has to offer when it comes to animation; and if you're going to see it, then see it for the surrealistic visuals. But wait, there's also a story going on here as well, and it involves themes of racism, war, and the usual futuristic material that a proper Sci-Fi film should have. \"Fantastic Planet\" is indeed fantastic, and in a great number of ways. It succeeds miraculously as an animated feature, a tense drama, and a compelling sci-fi film all in one. It doesn't take a good film to do this; it takes a great one. And in my opinion, \"Fantastic Planet\" is great; in fact, it might just be one of my favorite animated films yet. There's so much genius going on here at once that it's easy to loose track of the real picture set in front of you; but if you can comprehend this brilliant little bugger, then it's one of the best animated acid trips you will ever take. And considering the nigh inexcusable lack of trippy films these days, that's saying a lot. It's a nice piece of adult animation, but I have but one concern, and this particular one goes out to parents. To the parents who are reading; do not let your children watch this film. Chances are it will terrify them because the imagery is often times too frightening and \"fantastic\" for their age group to either comprehend or withstand. But as they grow, it might be good to expose this kind of stuff to them. It's not \"inappropriate\" by any means; I just don't want anyone's child to be scarred for life after watching stuff like this at a young age. It may be animated, but that does not mean it's for kids. If you were to ask me, I actually find something oddly charming about adult animated films; and perhaps it rests in their unique layers of complexity. \"Fantastic Planet\" is some damn good animation. And considering what can be done in animation, there's reason to see the thing as it is.\r\n\r\n        We set the scene on a planet inhabited by humanoid blue people called Draags, and another species of smaller humanoid beings called Oms. The two species live in harmony for quite some time; with the Draags often treating the tamed Oms as their pets while the Oms just go along with it. However, there are stray Oms, and they are starting a rebellion against the mere existence of the Draags. And these little guys are uncommonly feisty; in spite of their size. So the film is about a war; I'll admit that. But it's also about a central character, who is- in this case- a little boy who grows up as a tamed Om. The boy escapes his alien captors and joins a group of rebellious Om; all who share the same dream of freedom. He gets caught up in the middle of this grand war; and the film essentially builds itself around the themes of warfare and the future. The war depicting in this film mimics that of the Cold War, while the sci-fi themes are in plain sight. But this is no ordinary animated feature; it uses its visuals and plot to tell its story. You can look at the visuals and envision a plot on its own, or you can listen to the story being told. I did both; and got a lot out of this masterpiece. There's a lot of artistic design that went into the story and the visuals; and each good aspect makes \"Fantastic Planet\" all the more fantastic. It's one of the best adult animated films ever made; and one of the more memorable films of the 1970's. Some think that it has lost its spark, but I disagree. I think that \"Fantastic Planet\"- and its themes- is very much alive. It's for those who can accept it as art.\r\n\r\n       Sadly, there is not much to say about the voice cast of the film. There are not enough voice actors that should be considered note-worthy; although that does not mean they are bad. The film's voice cast sounds very good, and the only name I can find out of the entire cast- as of now- is Barry Bostwick. But I suppose this film is not about the cast; it's about the vision that has been created. That is what you should be paying attention to here; not so much the talents involved behind the voices of each character. Speaking of which, the characters in this film are very well developed. Despite the absence of the voice cast's notability, that's good enough for me.\r\n\r\n         This is what I want when I hear \"great animated film\". Sure, Pixar is nice. In fact, Pixar is pretty great. But they're a big, modern animated company; while \"Fantastic Planet\" is a little, \"old\" animated feature. It's not the kind of animated film that could be made anymore, because good or not, most of them use a lot of dialogue. This one in particular is like \"2001\" squeezed just a little bit beyond the one hour mark. The film is short- even for an animated film- but yet it tells a delicate story and has spectacular visuals. The film feels surreal, trippy, and all-around awesome. I have seen great French films; and I have also seen great animated films from France. But this one is one of the best; not only from its year or its decade, but also from French cinema alike. I will indeed treasure this film in some way or form. The visual style is revolutionary to me, and I'll recognize it from time-to-time. I will be recommending this work of art to many people; just not young children, for this is a piece of animation that was not made for them. Some will say that \"Fantastic Planet\" is a recommended \"family viewing\". Do not listen to these people; \"Fantastic Planet\" should only be watched by intelligent minds belonging to intelligent people. It's doubtful that the whole family will have that kind of mind, but if they do, then good for them; this film is one of the whole crowd. But you get my point; this is an intelligent and complex work of science fiction filmmaking. I was very entertained by the imagery, the story-telling, and the thematic elements alike.\r\n\r\n        I do not know why a film as great as this was forgotten by so many. Perhaps it was not marketed correctly, or perhaps the critical reception was divided. This animated film remains daring even to this day, but that's part of why I enjoyed it so much. There's a lot to look at and think about here; and how can you resist a film which has that kind of stuff in it? This film is very artistic, never explicit, but never \"kiddish\" either. It's animation for the grown-ups, and there's something I admire about that. But alas, this film cannot be put into words. It's the kind of surrealistic, cinematic acid trip that you need to experience for yourself; regardless of who you are. This film will please sci-fi and animation fans alike; and if you can dig it, then you can love it as well. And yes, I do love \"Fantastic Planet\". I love it very much. So much animation clich\u00e9s are non-existent here, and this is a film which wants to create animated art at any cost. The film will be intense, thematic, and complex whether we like it or not. Kids will run under the covers while the parents will remain fascinated. I think that this film is fairly spell-binding; or at least enough so that adults will like it or at least love it. You can say what you want about the film, but there's something ominous and savage about \"Fantastic Planet\" that I can't quite put my finger on. Strangely enough, that's kind of why I love it; because I don't fully understand it. I guess you don't need to understand this one completely to enjoy it as much as I did. But you sure need to enjoy it for starters. Chances are you will.",

It attempted to have a coherent plot, but in the end, I think that hurt \"Fantastic Planet,\" due to some sizable plot holes.  Why did the abandoned rocket factory still have power?  How did shooting giant, dancing statues with a laser render the Traags blind?  Your guess is as good as mine.  I'm not saying it should have gone the same route as \"Cat Soup,\" where very little is clear at all, but if the writer/director wanted a believable plot, then they should have tended to the holes.\n\nThen there's the pseudo-science babbling that crops up occasionally.  I appreciate the attempt to flesh out the world, but when you're doing it with entirely nonsensical terms, it means nothing.  \"Gaggfins emerge on the fejiner every twelve luopis, but lack the quintl to peif a skwerly emulsion\" makes about as much sense as a lot of the attempts to expound upon the world in this film.  True, there are often accompanying pictures, but they rarely help illuminate things all that much.\n\nOn that note however, I rather liked the animation in this film.  Somewhat reminiscent of the style found in \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" it is by turns simplistic and deceptively detailed, and always bizarre.  \"Fantastic Planet\" is a visual feast, that won't disappoint, if you have a taste for the surreal, and if you can forgive the lax writing.",

Fantastic Planet tells the story of a race of human-like people called Oms, who are dominated by giant beings called Draags, who are by comparison ten times bigger than the Oms. The story is pretty straight forward actually, which in a film like this, is good, as it allows the mind plenty of time to soak up the surreal visuals. The whole film is completely engrossing, preferring to stay in the realm of grotesquely odd, rather than throw complicated themes at you. This little gem is highly recommended for anyone who remotely likes animation and a must-see for anyone interested in a brilliant other worldly film. One of the many films that you push aside and tell yourself you\u0092ll eventually see; this one needs to come to the forefront of your \u0093need to see list.\u0094",

Less trippy and more artistically conscious I guess.\n\nThe story itself isn't that interesting except when put against the backdrop of the continued Russian presence in Czechoslovakia, post-Prague uprising.  However the scenery is laden with undefined symbolism which mean the relatively flat animation doesn't grate too much.

The animation is generated from crude line drawings (think midway between the Yellow Submarine or Monty Python's Flying Circus animation in terms of quality).  It's score is made up of synthesizer-sounding pops and hisses along with echoey, haunting melodies.  There's a somber tone and a slow pace as we follow a the human main character from captivity to freedom to rebellion.  The characters, except for the main character and his captor, are not very fleshed out.  I can't even get behind the hero very strongly, as he is also a narrator, giving incessant voice-over exposition throughout the film.  \nI think I got a simple message out of it: If you mistreat and abuse another race or ethnic group that you perceive as inferior, when in fact they are of equal value and intelligence, they will eventually learn how to rise up against you.  And when they do, they may make peace so everyone can coexist, but there will be a lot of death along the way if this path of war is taken.

We follow the story through a single Om named Terr who is adopted as a pet as a young boy after his mother dies and becomes pet to a young Draags female. Terr is smart for an Om and learns much of Draag culture and education until he reaches a point he can't learn anymore. At this point Terr escapes his captivity and ventures out into the free world only to discover a society of primitive, free Oms that live in fear of each other and the Draags. The film has powerful political overtones but told through such an imaginative way. The animation, music and voice acting is very calming and surreal. I remember as a kid this movie used to come on late night cable access the movie was so soothing it would help me fall asleep.",

A crack team of Czechoslovakian animators make the whole thing look like a bunch of De Chirico paintings.  Add a very 1973 soundtrack with the guitarist flooring the wah-wah and you've got a surprisingly excellent film.",

In its animation style, this movie is sui generis, even though the imagery, which owes much to Hieronymous Bosch, is echoed in some other animated films. The plot is lacking, making this just pretty wallpaper, unfortunately. The netflix label tells me its some sort of parable \"based on the Soviet occupation of the Czech Republic,\" but unless the Czech are thirty feet tall and use meditation to travel to the moon to have weird alien sex and nobody told me, I'm not seeing the metaphor.

It makes it feel like it's more of a collage of surreal images, than a regular animated movie. \nThe soundtrack has a mystical edge to it, and really helps to carry the story of the film. However, it must be said the story is simple, but it is told in a lucidly beautiful way, which gives the philosophical concepts it explores great emotional poignancy. To the aliens of this strange planet, humans are mere toys, kind of like insects are to us (the aliens and the humans in the films, share the same anatomic proportional ratio, as humans and insects). The film does not do the misstake of telling the film entirely from the point of view of the humans, but start of from the alien point of view, where it really makes us understand, even intimate how insignificant humans seem to the aliens.",
