This is a film that will make anyone with a heart cry. We see the Japanese side of the WWII equation and not one of the soldiers or military, rather of the everyday people on the ground and the chaos that would come to their homeland. The two children in the film are forced to make a plea for their own survival and living off the land and taking care of one another as nobody else has the time nor capability to do so. It's encompassing of world events and the state of the country of Japan certainly but is more so the tale of survival and hope, of children being the future and hopefully a future devoid of war and death on such a needless scale. In my opinion Studies Ghibili's most heart wrenching film and that says something amazing! If you can handle a sad film that is utterly devastating but has a strong and uplifting message, you can't do much better!",

I still had some gripes (mostly that I found it hard to believe the aunt and the farmer would be so calloused as to abet the kids' starvation), but when compared to its peers in the categories of 80s, war and animated movies this surely belongs near the very top.

Watership Down yes, Bambi yes, Secret of NIMH yes, Beauty and the Beast yes, Land Before Time yes, but Grave of the Fireflies is in a different league. A film that is once seen and never forgotten, a film that is beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating. It is slow moving perhaps and \"depressing\" but it is very poignant as well. I find it very difficult to fight back tears at the film's end. The animation is amazingly detailed, the backgrounds and characters are drawn with such care and you just marvel at the detail that goes into it. The music is both haunting and melancholic and one of the main reasons why the film is as it is. The story is harrowing, as it details Seita and Setsuko's hopelessness. The characters are easy to relate, Setsuko isn't precocious or obnoxious, instead she is quite cute, and Seita shows real love for his sister as well as being a strong protagonist. There are many memorable sequences, but one that springs to mind is the one with the nocturnal fireflies, which is something of true melancholic beauty. Overall, a masterpiece, pure and simple. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The anti-war message is clear and by seeing the fate of the characters degrading as much as the story goes is absolutely devastating. I was sympathizing with Seito an Setzuko for the whole story because they are just kids, but in a hostile climate, they had to survive, a difficult task for kids. You see the war and the fact that everyone around them are being so harsh (including their aunt) and I just had so much mercy and, seeing the end is just terrible. I think the director searched this effect and he clearly succeeded. After that, they didn't just achieved a punching, philosophical and sad masterpiece, they also made a fantastic animated feature.

            "content": "Take Bambi's mom dying, the opening montage of Up, and the ending of Toy Story 3 mix them together, and you get the cheerfulness that is Grave of the Fireflies‚Ä¶ This film is depressing to a fault, which begs the question: Who is this for? The 1988 Studio Ghibli movie concerns two siblings, teenage Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi) and his kid sister, Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi), at the end of World War II. We generally follow Seita as he does the best he can for providing for his sister after his mother (Yoshiko Shinohara) dies from burns sustained during an American firebombing campaign. It's standard to render the protag(s) orphans in a children's movie, but the animation showing their mother's death is particularly brutal. It's a story about resilience, desperation, and (stubborn?) pride. Seita and Setsuko end up leaving their condescending distant-aunt's (Akemi Yamaguchi) home for a life of complete freedom in an abandoned bomb-shelter. Desperate for food, Seita even takes to running into the city as it's bombed to scavenge for resources while its inhabitants take cover. Besides a handful of moments of the siblings enjoying their bucolic freedom ‚Äî most notably, the gorgeous scene of the fireflies unleashed inside the shelter ‚Äî there are very, very few moments of hope. Grave of the Fireflies has a (100/95) score on Rotten Tomatoes, so my expectations were pretty high. And while the film has plenty of courageous and heartwarming (and depressing, it's okay to feel the blues) scenes, there were three changes I would've made: 1. Why the heck does Seita take so long to bring his child sister to the doctor? She's clearly dying (of malnutrition? Some skin disease?) and it feels cruel that he doesn't take her much earlier ‚Äî eventhough the doctor isn't helpful at all. 2. He had access to his dead mother's bank account this entire time, but just let's himself and his child sister starve? That scene was jaw-droppingly shocking. And 3., on a more artistic note, I wouldn't have revealed the siblings reunite in the afterlife in the beginning. It's such a beautiful scene, especially the way it shows them overlooking the modern-day city skyline (which gave serious A Ghost Story vibes) that its impact would've been felt in the chest had it not already been revealed ‚Äî it also would've made Setsuko's death that much more shocking and their reunification, dare I say, a happy ending?",

As always, they excel in emotional storytelling and the haunting beauty of their animation, and the story they tell is as saddening as it possibly could be. But the movie, no matter how sad it makes you feel, how lovely it looks and how profound it is in its antiwar message, is not without any cracks. I, personally, found two. The storytelling here does a lousy job at explaining protagonist's intentions behind not searching for a job when he really should. Was there no jobs available to him, was he to stubborn to work or was there some kind of other reason? I don't know and I never will, and it frustrates me, because it makes some of Seita's decisions irritatingly unexplainable. The second crack was, for me, the finale, which seemed a bit too on the nose and also prolonged a bit too much. So there's that. Sad and beautiful, and profound, but not without a fault.",

I feel for Setsuko too, obviously, but Seita carries a burden that hardly any military could carry. I absolutely will never see this again, but this movie will go with me for life!",

At first it may feel that this movie lacks the classic Studio Ghibli magic that we have come to expect and love, but it quickly becomes clear that this is not the case. Although there are few fantastical elements to the film, the characters regularly experience the magic of simply existing in the world that has taken so much from them - whether that be sharing a couple fruit drops, singing songs in the rain, or collecting dozens of fireflies to light up a makeshift bedroom. The animation and score play together perfectly to highlight this magic without shielding us from the harsh realities of our characters' world. Grave of the Fireflies is simply incredible.",

It's like the Schindler's List of anime, Grave of the Fireflies' story chronicles Akiyuki Nosaka's real life surviving WWII firebombing of Japan. His life is one of those devastating tragedies that I have a hard time watching, but I was genuinely moved by Grave of the Fireflies. Isao Takahata's writing is so authentic to how children speak and behave among themselves, that this picture feels like you are really seeing two kids starve from malnutrition as every adult refuses to help these poor kids. Grave of the Fireflies is sincerely touching and deeply disturbing.\n\nIsao Takahata's direction is beautiful as he authentically captures life in Japan during the air raids. His stunning filmmaking is profound as Grave of the Fireflies makes you rethink what is precious to you in life as well as what is actually a necessity in life like food or shelter. Takahata proves himself a master of direction with one simple movie that is masterfully told through Studio Ghibli's expressive hand drawn animation. All the colors look like real life choices with no exaggerated styles for the planes, fires, or people. It's very engaging.\n\nI was never bored for all of Grave of the Fireflies' brief 89 minute run-time. Takeshi Seyama edited this film down to the bare minimum in order to convey this tragic tale of brutal survival and awful loss. Nobuo Koyama's cinematography captures serious emotions with mostly close-ups of the childrens' faces, so that you really empathize with their pain. All the wide shots of the brother and sister playing together are fun and heartbreaking at the same time.\n\nNizou Yamamoto and Katsu Hisamura's art direction is lovely with bright blue skies against burning red flames or realistic homes barren of furnishings during wartime. Yoshifumi Kondo's striking visual effects for night time fireflies glowing in the midnight darkness with the fainest shimmer lighting up a sad child's face for a moment. Kondo's animation is some of the briefest levity in a cold, desperate wartorn world that Grave of the Fireflies paints.\n\nMichio Mamiya's score is pretty, but so melancholic with low tones and sweeping sorrow. Mamiya adds to the misery that is Grave of the Fireflies. I'm very impressed by all the genuinely upset sounding voice acting also.\n\nIn conclusion, Grave of the Fireflies demands to be seen because sometimes we need to endure suffering in order to learn from war's effects on the most vulnerable among humanity.",

Few war films can match the emotional devastation of Takahata's work, masterfully paired with gorgeous animation from Ghibli and arranged into a taut narrative of less than 90 minutes.

Most movies, war or otherwise, don't start literally with the death of a child. Grave of the Fireflies does. In its scant running time it manages to show the camaraderie and community of a people suffering, it shows the unflinching boots on the ground of the affected and the afflicted, it is very possibly the greatest unglorifying anti-war film ever made. \n\nBeing animated allows not just for more beauty; the stillness and movement drawing you in so much more delicately, but it allows for more of the hideousness, revealing the tacit horror and ugliness without grossing you out; the animation cutting to the bone of the realism in a transcendent way. \n\nThere are moments of sheer brilliance; the fact that the kids reunite in the afterlife (portrayed in a plain and unsentimental way) makes their respective deaths tinged with relief rather than grief. Privately remembering the young child's frivolity after her death, ushering memories that couldn't concern the older child whilst in the midst of protecting her, but that he allows himself to remember when the responsibility has left him is superbly simple and common to anyone who has experienced looking after a loved one who has passed. A brief beat where she repairs the shirt and pricks her finger speaks volumes enough in one simple moment for an essays worth of complexity. \n\nI first watched this film a long time ago, upon only beginning to start to understand the potential depth and complexity of Japanese animation. As a young man, I watched it in the dark with a room full of Eastern European men that probably expected, as I did, that I might have brought something light for us to all watch, considering it was animated. By the end there wasn't a dry eye in the house as be lights came on and not one of us was ashamed because of it. \n\nGrave of the Fireflies is refreshingly and appropriately unsentimental. It's not political, it's human. It's deeply sad, very telling of a nation when they see war through these eyes, which makes it personal, raw and very, very important.",

The firestorm that followed burned a large part of the city and killed almost 9,000 people. After their mother dies of horrible burns, fourteen-year-old Seita and his four-year-old sister Setskuo go to live with their aunt. Soon disagreements emerge because, due to war food shortages, their aunt treats them as a burden, so the two kids soon decide to move into an abandoned bomb shelter...\n\nThis simple and very tender animated movie, speaks in a very moving way not only about the tragedy of an innocent childhood, helpless before the horrors of war, but also channels the pain and despair we feel when faced with the fact that we live in a civilization that allowed these things to happen, and still allows. Based on actual events, described in the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Akiyuki Nosaka.",

In this case, a brother and sister who must stick together to survive its horrors. Do not expect a Pixar or Disney flick if you watch it, because that is not at all what you will get. It's a tale of desperate survival in the face of insurmountable odds, with the brother constantly struggling to keep his sister alive, while simultaneously trying to distract her from the fact that nothing will ever be the same again. The war pops up now and then to remind us that's its still happening, but the focus is kept on the leads, and even with the Japanese surrender things keep going from bad to worse. Its been called an anti-war film, without anyone involved outright stating it, and I can see why people get this impression. Its presses home how war destroys homes, families and communities, tears people apart, literally and figuratively, and when you're on the losing side there isn't the satisfaction of victory to comfort you. But for me, most war films are anti-war by definition, since most of them show how horrible it can be. Grave Of The Fireflies might be animated, but that doesn't detract from how raw, emotional and true to life it feels.",

It's also frustrating that this kind of thing happens even when you have a support network, like is shown here in the film. Too often family members think of additional people and responsibilities as burdens that aren't worth their time, and it's one of the gravest moral errors somebody can make. We do it to our elderly by trying to get them dead as fast as we can to get our inheritance, we forgo parental responsibility because it would inconvenience us, and this kind of selfishness actually pervades all of the different aspects of society. The character Seita shows the kind of person we should all ascribe to be, doing anything he can to bring his little sister happiness, despite the fact that living here on Earth can never be a fair existence. Your emotions are torn at throughout the film, but it is hard not to feel really depressed by the end of it. Some of the sequences don't make a lot of sense because the film is told in a flash forward, flashback style that leaves the viewer sometimes a little clueless as to what is going on.

Now if you haven‚Äôt seen Grave of the Fireflies you might be thinking it‚Äôs cruel of me to spoil the ending, but if you watch it you‚Äôll find that they spoiled it as well. I‚Äôve been struggling a lot lately with movies that show the end at the beginning and then the whole movie is a flashback, and this one falls into that category as well. I know it can often be the journey that‚Äôs more rewarding than the destination, but I think it undercuts the emotional impact of the ending here since I already knew it was coming. And I feel like the emotion was one of the driving purposes of the film so I hate to see that diminished. The children are adorable characters, and you can‚Äôt help falling in love with little Setsuko. It‚Äôs hard to watch how these times of desperation can bring out the worst in some people. Grave of the Fireflies is also one of those movies that gets you thinking about what you would do, and what might be the best decisions for Seita.

The film shows both the large-scale drama of the Second World War in Japan, but also the small-scale drama that occurs in the Seita and Setsuko family. There are some beautiful sentimental moments in this movie, but these moving scenes are even more powerful because they are mirrored by the beautiful moments that brother and sister have together. Seita is forced by the situation to behave like an adult, but in some scenes it appears that he has not lost all childish mercy and naivety. These are the scenes that give his character a lot of depth and make him human. A beautiful example is the scene in which Seita and Setsuko catch fireflies together to release them into their mosquito net.\nIt may be clear that I enjoyed this film much more and will never be able to watch Ghibli in the same way. Hotaru no Haka is one of the most beautiful war dramas I ever saw and I was truly stirred while watching. The film shows that animation and especially Studio Ghibli can be more than cheerful fantasy characters",

            "content": "Japanese culture has long progressed since its imperialistic days of World War II, but anti-war and the concept of life being temporary has remained omnipresent. Japanese animations that hit American theaters are often fun, creative plots that are more eccentric and interesting than a Pixar movie.\nGrave of the Fireflies is arguably one of the most prominent Studio Ghibli movies because it deviates far from this norm, but in the way studios of Japan, untarnished at the time by the impending influence of making films that will gross well, can do successfully. The film opens with a shocking scene showing the main character of the film, a young boy named Seita, dying alone in a train station. The film then follows the life of Seita and Setsuko, two children in Japan who become parentless and homeless during World War II, showing the events that culminate to this scene. When the extended family conflict with the young children, the two small children leave and start a life of their own. As Seita and Setsuko live on their own, life begins to get more difficult as the war makes it difficult even for otherwise financially comfortable citizens to live in.\nThe purely raw emotion that this film emits is heavy-hitting. The minimalistic and simple plot of the movie allows for the two children to develop significantly. Seita from a young age is forced to become a strong father figure to his little sister and provide for her, while resiliently absorbing pain and slowly becoming more expressionless and desensitized. Without any explanation or reveal of how they're thinking, the viewer witnesses their lives unfold and experience the same waves of emotion that they feel. The amount of realism put into this film is also unforgiving, the movie never begins to evolve into a clich√© \"things will eventually get better\" stage. \nWhat truly separates this film from any animation I have seen is how unforced yet significant the emotion is. There is no heartfelt violin or piano track, no random breaks in character. All the sorrow that is felt stems purely from watching their circumstances grow more onerous. The children try to make things better for themselves, taking on adult responsibilities from the result of destruction that other adults have unleashed in front of them. It becomes apparent that despite their age, they have morally outgrown the brutality they inherited. This is a movie worth seeing not only to experience an emotional roller coaster but to provoke thought after watching how harsh humanity really is through the innocent eyes of a child. 5/5",

The image of Japan has been treated as the bloody figure of \"always winning\" and the kamikazes who gave their lives just to achieve their objectives. Here we see something that breaks with it. The people who suffered the most were not the soldiers but the civilians, who directly went through from famine, terror and the lack of resources. \"The Grave of the Fireflies\" relates how two very young brothers faced these events and the result is sad, bleak, yet hopeful. A caricatured film should never be underestimated, let alone if it is so historically attached to a poetic and living history of love, sacrifice and survival in the face of the crisis of a warlike event where the world of adults is even cruel and more painful. The beauty with which this film moves is able to embrace its audience due to the excellent lyrical use with which fragile events develop, facing the crudeness of reality but not corrupting itself against this adversity, continuing to enjoy childhood and the opportunity they have to live. 83/100",

As I watched it, I saw that this film has a great story, great characters and great animation. Also as I was watching it, I had a real sense of emotion and although you're told at the beginning that the two main characters (Seita and Setsuko) are dead, you really want them to make it through this but as their situation gets worse, you start to have the same feelings as they are. My favorite scene in the movie is the ending where the two siblings are on a bench in the spirit world looking over modern day Japan, the reason being is because after all the hell they have been though, they are finally in peace and its a really touching scene. Overall, Grave of the Fireflies is a Anime masterpiece, it has great focus and story and it shows that Anime is more than cray hair or superpower. It's decently not just one of the greatest Anime Movies, but one of the greatest movies period.",

The film remains extremely patriotic towards it's nation (and reason why I believe it's no anti-war film) and even the director expressed that it has no anti-war message. The story is instead of that of a brother and sister(both kids) and their relationship. The character of Satsuko is always memorable and would stick to my heart. Fireflies manage to render it's emotional story without much of the unnecessary melodrama and is heartfelt.",

If other people tell you about this movie, they may tell you that it brought tears to their eyes, even if they didn't want it to. Part of this is true. The first half does indeed show the horrors of war, and is an interesting first half of a film. But as for the second half of the film, I originally said it 'fumbled the ball.' This is not the case. Instead, it presented exactly what the author wanted to present ,to the point where I couldn't bring myself to shed a single tear.\n\nInstead, I was metaphorically banging my head due to the poor decisions on the part of the protagonist that makes up the second half of the movie. If the kid had just gone back to his aunt and apologized, (as virtually every other single character told him to do,) both he and his sister would still be alive. I understand that the idea was to show where pride gets you, as well as to comment on the state of Japanese youngsters at the time the movie was made, (the 80's, wherein Japan was filled with young, irresponsible, violent delinquents) but to do so in such a way that presents your protagonist as an idiot is nothing short of manipulative and ham-fisted. And supporting this is the fact that, while this is semi-autobiographical, the protagonist, Seita, dies in the film, but in the actual real events that this story is based on, he survived. The author manipulated true events to convey the folly of pride, as well as to express his feelings and survivors guilt, and while I completely understand why he did this, he still manipulated the truth to do so. And furthermore, this altering of the truth means that this film is still, at the end of the day, fiction, even if it has some basis in truth, and is still subject to critique. In the end, all I could do past the half-way point was grit my teeth and mutter, 'Go back to the grandmother, go back to the grandmother, go back to the grandmother...!'\n\nAnd to elaborate on the manipulation, part of the reason of doing this was to show Japanese youngsters how hard their parents had it, and that they should be damn grateful, and shouldn't be so delinquent as the were at the time. That's not a film, that's a parent-to-offspring lecture. And to manipulate the truth to bring about that lecture -- to have Seita die and make all the wrong decisions, instead of living like his real-life counterpart did -- is nothing short of disgraceful.\n\nIn conclusion, this film had a promising beginning, but in the end, didn't follow up on that promise, and instead presented us with one of the most maddeningly frustrating films I have ever born witness to. True, this film's basic plot, also occurred in real life, but again, due to heavily altering the outcome, (the sister still died, but the brother actually lived,) the film is ultimately fiction, and so I still judge it as a work of fiction. As a means of presenting us with a visual lecture, it does it's job. But as a work of fiction, it fails.",

I doubt it.\n\nWriting children is difficult, but who really wants to see \"that\" child? \"That\" child, who always cries about every little thing and does not allow itself to be comforted, unless it gets candy shoved in its face.\nEven so, it was hard for me to judge this character, as the movie does play in a war, and the girl is aware of her mother's death and is starving. But because she seems so conscient about certain things, I could not excuse the rest. She simply appeared whiny to me.\n\nAlso, by mainly showing scenes where the characters are stuffing their faces, and by keeping their chubby designed heads intact, I didn't really believe they were starving that much. The sister collapsing came a bit out of nowhere for me.\n\nOne day I'll bother to watch the Japanese version. It might change my mind after all.",

However, Grave joins many other films in its category of chopping onions: it's more of an exploitation of the expectations of its destined-for-doom storyline, rather than a substantially moving piece altogether.\n\nEspecially once you start connecting the dots and aligning the irresponsible -- and often headscratching -- decisions made by its main characters. Depending on which English dub you see, you might have criticism regarding some of the voice acting.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies certainly isn't any less admirable in some sense of the word and as any critic or filmgoer can tell you, it isn't incapable of flooding every dry eye in the room.

The director has come out and said, 'no, this isn't an anti war film' and then goes to explain what he sees the film as and while it does work from that angle if that's how you want to see it, it works much more as an anti-war film. \n\nI can understand why some people seem to say its their fault they are in the situation they are in because of some things that they do but that's a pretty dark way to look at it, sure if you're looking at it from the other side it makes sense, a bit, because they weren't doing anything in the place they were staying but still, that's a cynical way to look at it. But still that aunt is a bitch and I hate her, I could rant about her but spoilers all I will say is, I don't think anybody would really behave like she did. \n\nThe two main characters are really likeable and Setsuko is just so cute that the impact of what war does to the average people is really shown in full force here. Besides being already hard to watch because of the depressing nature, its just when the fireflies actually show up and some brief relief is given to these characters, in an absolutely beautiful sequence, it hurts even more when it comes to a halt almost as soon as it has begun. The beginning of the film makes a lot more sense and means a whole lot more after you've finished the film that it is hard not to cry. The music is excellent also and accompanies scenes fantastically, especially this one. \n\nThis has been a very hard review to write, and I have already written much more than I thought I would, that every few lines or so I would just distract myself on purpose or find any excuse to do something else, not because I didn't like it and am forcing myself to write something positive so it looks like I did like it, no way! It's just that I was so invested in the film that recalling what happened makes me want to tear up again. I wasn't even thinking about writing a review after it, like I do with most things I see, nothing in the world mattered, and in those last 30 minutes, boy, I was crying so much I didn't even know what to think, I haven't cried to a film like that in almost two years. I only wrote two notes during the whole thing and that was in the first 20 minutes. \n\nIt is a superb animated feature that is a perfect example to show those who simply dismiss it because it is animated and really does enforce the saying of don't judge a book by its cover, it works so much better as an animated film and it's just as good as any American production, and in most cases, is even better. It is totally unforgettable.",

An achingly sad anti-war film, Grave of the Fireflies is one of Studio Ghibli's most profoundly beautiful, haunting works. There are magical moments of natural beauty and childish delight, too - which only make the tragedy even more harrowing. Ultimately, the picture's respect for Seito and Setsuko's ability to fend for themselves results in a far more powerful piece of cinema than if they'd been portrayed as the typical scared kid. It evokes the experiences of childhood grief, small moments of ordinary life and happiness amid tragedy and fear, and the overwhelming confusion of adult responsibilities falling on teenaged shoulders as powerfully as in any film I've seen. A haunting, harrowing war movie, an emotionally devastating character study, and an extraordinarily restrained example of anime or Japanese animation, Grave of the Fireflies is a unique and unforgettable masterpiece. It is hard to believe that Grave of the Fireflies, one of the saddest animated films ever made.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD.

But this is ultimately a film, not about war per se, but rather about memory and oblivion, personal story and national history. The protagonists are shown as ghosts in the end of the film wandering against the background of Tokyo, which seems to have been modernized after the war. This is not an optimistic image, as in that there is afterlife and the brother and sister are together at last, but rather a symbolic one that shows the 'forgotten' and their personal story, excluded by history, which moves on. History cannot accomodate in its memory all the personal stories of its victims who die early as fireflies do. That's why in the beginning of the film we see the protagonist half-dead being made fun of by passersby who expect the Americans to come and bring the new order after Japan's defeat. It is this lack of any justice even on the level of memory that makes the film so emotionally devastating and counterbalances the melodrama. It is the fact that there is suffering but a suffering that is not known by anyone except from the sufferer, that never reaches the public sphere to become a narrative with meaning that works as its justification; the protagonists are denied being 'heroes' in their suffering. Of course their story becomes known to the viewer and that is the magic of film. Takahata escapes all the pitfalls of melodrama, despite the basic story can easily be described as that, also by subtly showing us details of the landscape instead of focusing on the characters too much in moments of tension. The best film of Studio Ghibli!",

Grave Of The Fireflies \n\nReleased at the same time as Totoro, Grave of the Fireflies was the less successful of the two, but ultimately the more intense and memorable, even if the contrast leaves them utterly incomparable. In a sentence: this is the most depressing film I've ever seen. It tells the heartbreaking tale of two siblings' desperate struggle to survive after World War 2, shattering audiences by building family bonds in the face of grim devastation, all very timeless and unpleasant and ughhh. Even the colouring gives us the sense of poverty and starvation, Takahata opting to use brown outlines rather than the customary black (the first of any anime to do so) which accentuated the misery to the point of making me want to vomit. I mean, it was never supposed to be easy to watch the suffering of little children, and as a result, is not made for children whatsoever unless you want them to cry until their eyes dissolve within the tears. Which is why this is probably the most unusual and distinctive of all the Ghiblis, disregarding the company's trademarks, shunning all magic and losing all hope, whilst smearing a dark stain on your innocence. \n\nTo read the rest of my 'Worst to Best: Studio Ghibli' list, click here: http://juicenothing.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/worst-to-best-studio-ghibli.html",

I am not afraid to turn on the waterworks for a good sad movie but I did not cry? I guess I'm a little disappointed.\n\nFew things: great title. Secondly, yes it's probably subdued anime, but story is story, so if the story is good, I'm willing to watch black and white, anime, whatever. The summer blockbusters in America are not about story as much as experience and effect, and this movie is pretty much the antithesis of that.\n\nMy mistake may have been watching the English dubbed version. Typically, I would watch in its original language and read subtitles, but I figured since it was animated anyway, it wouldn't be as bothersome. The imdb people say the English dub is comically bad at times, and maybe that's what took me out of it. \n\nThat said, it is a neat story that is basically timeless in an age of constant war. I do like the method of showing the ending first, then working back to the ending. I just think, given the technology back in 1988 when this was made, and the possibly bad English track, maybe the film was not as strong as it could have been. I was even hesitant to watch it because I wasn't sure I wanted to watch something so sad, but no tears from me.",

And while I  cannot call it that, it is still pretty good, and you'd have to be EXTREMELY cynical to not be even REMOTELY moved by it.\r\n\r\nThis thing might be the saddest film ever (even if I didn't cry during it), and I will acknowledge it is haunting AND fucking scary.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I am surprised I liked it, let alone THIS much. I walked in expecting it to be a piece of shit, and it was actually a good film. Too bad Dreamworks, Disney/Pixar, or ANYONE else hasn't seemed to learn from this.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrave focuses on a child and an old teenager named Seita and a girl whose name I cannot pronounce.\r\nAfter Americans bombed their house, they need to find shelter somewhere else. \r\n\r\nThe voice acting in this film is good. I mean, Grave doesn't feel like an animation at all. It feels like a live action film, which works perfectly. If you are one of those fuckheads who was sentimental enough to cry at Up, I would not like to see what Grave would do to you.\r\n\r\nNo movie has EVER made me cry, and this film did not make me cry either. However, a good 95-97% of the population will cry like babies on this one, and AGAIN this is a GOOD MOVIE. \r\n\r\nGrave May or may not be accurate in its depiction of these events, but it is powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you read the first part of this goddamn review, you'll remember me complaining at how modern Animators haven't learnt from this. \r\n\r\nWell, Grave feels like a live action movie, and considering its subject matter, this works well. \r\nLook, when I watch a normal an, I say \"this is animation\" and I really don't take it serious. This thing feels like a live action movie, and say what you say about animation, but the whole point of animations a to \"do the impossible\" as in animation we can do shit we can't do in live action. But the drawback is simple- it doesn't feel life action. Happily, we don't have to deal with that here, as considering the subject matter, way it is executed, etc, that isn't so.\r\n\r\nMost animated films are for kids, but Grave isn't. Grave of the Fireflies is basically The Dark Knight of animation. You may think it's for kids, but it isn't. This film is pretty motherfucking sad, and little kids won't like cause of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal score for Grave of The Fireflies: 8/10 stars\r\nThis may be the best animated film ever (that isn't saying a lot, though) and it may change the way you think about animation. It's sadder that fuck, one thing for sure.",

            "content": "To be completely transparent, I can't say that I \"enjoyed\" watching Grave of the Fireflies. The first line in the movie spells out exactly what's going to happen. In World War II Japan, two gentle, sweet, and loving siblings are going to wind up dead. There isn't a second of hopeful yearning in the movie. We dread the eventual outcome from the very first scene. So, as I said, I didn't particularly enjoy myself while watching this movie. But there are some times when you don't watch a movie to be entertained. There are times when you watch a movie because it tells a story entirely worth telling. There are times when you appreciate a movie for every reason other than enjoyment. Grave of the Fireflies is just such a movie.\r\n\r\nThere's no real need to get into the story. I've already explained all you really need to know. \r\n\r\nWhat makes the movie so brilliant is how incredibly well made it is. How unexpected it is. How heartbreakingly beautiful it is. It's like 90 minutes of \"lows.\" Usually, a film travels through highs and lows, sometimes from scene to scene. Grave of the Fireflies can't help but exist in a state of constant dread. Sure there are joyful scenes, in fact, there are quite a few of them. But every time we're shown a scene of Seita and Setsuko being what they are, cheerful young children, we know that they will, eventually, die. There's no spoiler in writing that last sentence. Still, the movie does have it's moments of light. The film shows Seita and Setsuko living out substantial days ... pleasurable days. But at the end of the road, we know exactly where our two main characters will wind up. This makes every other scene that much more tragic. It's incredibly done.\r\n\r\nRarely do you see a movie deliver a message as powerfully as Grave of the Fireflies manages to deliver its own. The film shows a side of war that we never think of. Nowadays, next to no one in America is remotely proud of the fact that we spent parts of 1944 and 1945 dropping incendiary bombs on Japan. We aren't too fond of that fact, but then again, we don't really think about it much. Grave of the Fireflies shows you a snippet of that pain and suffering, and in its 90 minute run-time, sends an irrefutable antiwar message. But this isn't like a Miyazaki movie message. It isn't some fantasy world where the character tell us why war is so horrible. In fact, in Grave of the Fireflies, the filmmakers' never once utter an antiwar statement. But the film doesn't have to. It just shows us, with every frame, that war is undeniably awful. \r\n\r\nAnd it does all this without ever pulling back from its core story. We never have to see the \"big picture.\" The movie never shows us anything other than the story of our two main characters. And yet, the film is still able to be one of the most devastating war films ever. Because we know that Seita and Setsuko aren't the only young people in war-time to have gone through something as appalling. This movie does a cataclysmic job of reminding audiences of something they don't often/choose not to think about. \r\n\r\nThe two main characters are just a bit too upbeat to be true. That's one of my few nitpicks with this movie. Seita never breaks from being a perfectly pleasant young man. He's tragically gentle and kind. Setsuko does have moments that remind us that she's still a 4 year old. But for the most part, she is uncommonly happy. Still, it's only the slightest of flaws.\r\n\r\nThe animation isn't anything surprising or groundbreaking, per se. It is really touching and beautiful on multiple occasions. It's a movie about unspeakable tragedy that is as moving as you would expect it to be. The animation, like the movie, is very subtle and very lovely. It's odd, because the movie is set absolutely in the real world, but it does have moments that are strangely magical. It can't really be described, it has to be experienced.\r\n\r\nGrave of the Fireflies does something that is absolutely never seen in the animation genre. It is a film that is in no way suitable for children. It's a story where every member of a tender-hearted family winds up dead. It's a movie where grief and tragedy are seamlessly intermingled with beauty and kindness. I can't say that I thoroughly enjoyed myself while watching this film. And if I were to rate this film on entertainment value, it probably wouldn't score higher than a 7.5/10. But this movie exists on a different level. It's a film that boasts a higher calling than to simply entertain you. With that in mind, it deserves nothing less than a perfect score. \r\n\r\n\"Why must fireflies die so young?\" 10/10",

This rare of a beastly movie surpasses all the American cliches (both animated & live action films, specifically Disney), all the animation that exists in this world, and even the great epics by Hayao Miyazaki (even his Mononoke wasn't that depressing! In the least it still showed signs of all hope and happy endings and such). And yet it's so touching and moving... yet still so depressing all the same. It's all too vivid. The colours, the scenes of gruesome war and all. Probably the most depressing part of all is when Seita cremates his sister's body (that part really disturbed me, especially when his sister died. That made me cry both externally and internally). I wouldn't exactly recommend this film to the mentally unfit; this film would've easily driven them to depression of perhaps, even worse. Especially children. I wouldn't recommend this film to children. I watched this when I was 14 and this film really disturbed me for quite some time. But I've gotten over it. If it could successfully disturbed me then you wouldn't even need me to say for the younger kids. What I love about Takahata is that his films redefines the term \"animation\" - not necessarily meaning it has to be made for children. This movie certainly passed that age range.\n\nA rare creation which probably comes once in a never. A film which delivered such powerful messages, in which exceeds the usual moral story of Disney films and more; messages in which to tells us to avoid war, in which that you must learn to sacrifice, in which you become a better person to all human beings in this world, and to yourself.\n\nThis film earns my respect.

That contrast is ultimately what makes this film work and as a result it manages to rise above many other films going for the same thing and this one does it with such simplicity that it puts the rest to shame\r\n\r\nIt's pretty clear what's coming with this one and it's never pleasant as a result- everything beautiful here is just there to make you feel worse later. It's unrelenting, plain brutal and very cruel. War is much the same though but it's hard to create a film that shows all of that without being so repelling that we refuse to take the message to heart. That's where Studio Ghibli come in- it's brilliantly animated and looks great to this day and the original voicing is well-delivered and touching. All of the charm of the genre is shown here and ultimately blasted away by its message. That's exactly the plan and it certainly works. \r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if it went beyond the tear jerking and offered up something a little less simplistic but we are following children here and this one does feel like a view of the world from their eyes so it's understandable why it does what it does.\r\n\r\nIf you want a film to basically make you feel like crap then this is probably the one for you. if you want a film that does anything other than that, you're in the wrong place.",

Looking for aid, they decide to seek refuge in their aunt's house. Seita and Setsuko are allowed to live there, but their aunt convinced Seita to exchange his mother's Kimono for rice. Over time, Seita and Setsuko decided to live by themselves because of her unfairness.\n\nNot having any proper shelter to live in, Seita and Setsuko move to an abandoned shelter. With the money his mother had in her savings, Seita bought some hardware and food supplies to survive. With their Mom dead and their Dad living far away to fight for their country, Seita and Setsuko must fight the cruelness of life. \nOne of Ghibli's very first feature films, and maybe one of Ghibli's most touching. I've only seen 3 of Ghibli's: My Neighbors the Yamadas, Spirited Away, and Ponyo. I'm not trying to say that others are not touching or not good, but Grave of the Fireflies is tragic I almost cried. I'm a person that hardly gets emotionally attached with a film. I've seen films that often make people cry or something like that and didn't feel sad or whatsoever, but this time it's different. I love seeing Setsuko being a happy and healthy kid. I'm impressed by how Seita is strong enough to foster his only sister.\n\nDirector Isao Takahata, who is not a big fan of fantasy, made this film as real as possible. You can feel the uproar of the Japanese when their hometown is being raided by the Allied Forces, and to see your loved ones lose their lives slowly in front of you. Classic, traditional suburban Japan is peaceful and calming, portrayed well in this 89 minutes film. You will join in an emotion rollercoaster throughout the film: happy, sad, depressed, right from the start. As a family film, Takahata tried his best not to include a sad ending, which is quite inevitable for a film with such depressing storyline.\n\nThe voice actor did their best and blend in nicely eith their own characters, especially Setsuko. Her voice is so lovable. Though, there are few minor voice recording errors that make the voice sounds a bit weird.\n\nLooking at war from a different perspective of life, Grave of the Fireflies is one masterpiece that should not be missed. Even though it won't be my all time favourite, this film will leave a special impression for me. Every single man who whink they are one tough heartless guy should watch this. Kudos to Isao Takahata-san.",

I dare say that it's inevitable that when Studio Ghibli was created, you had two sides of one coin, the first coin was Hayao Miyazaki, who became one of the greatest animation gods who ever lived, bringing a visual imaginary sort of work, but on the other side you had Isao Takahata, a more serious director who wanted to naturally prove a point in the films that he wrote that made a huge impact on Japanese lifestyle, and I think you can guess exactly who I'm talking about this time. Takahata with Studio Ghibli wanted to make a more serious film regarding life in 1945 Imperial Japan who had gone to war in World War II with America. In interesting trivia, this film was released back to back with another film, which will get to later. It was also the film that was released right after Castle in the Sky, about 4 years prior when Ghibli became an actual film industry. Let me just give you the first sentence to this review:\n\nWe have a fourteen-year-old brother named Seita who has a younger five-year-old sister named Setsuko who are trying to survive daily life in World War II in Japan, their mother sadly perishes in a napalm air raid and are forced to live with their aunt. \n\n\"And this is where I have to stop.\"\n\nIf I were to reveal any more of this film I'd probably get tired of explaining everything that's remotely important and give away WAY TOO MUCH.\n\nFirst off, I have to explain a lot about this particular film, because honestly there is a lot. This film is not necessarily about the two characters, at all, they are more so constructs. A term meaning examples of what life in Japan was like during and after the war, it's not that the main characters are bad or anything it's because of the way they are portrayed. And yes, this film is sad, it's REALLY, REALLY sad. And you know what, I knew pretty much the majority of the film before the rest even played out when I watched it the first time, but its impact that it had on me hasn't diminished at all, it has become a film, where I watched it once, and I couldn't watch it again afterwards. And part of it I have to say really comes from the fact that it's a very hard film to not only watch, but to review.\n\nIs it a bad film? Well... there has been many different takes on it. For me personally, I could not bring myself up to watch this film again for many reasons, the characters or, constructs, plot, and meaning is very contriving and the plot is very predictable. What the film is basically supposed to be about is to teach us this grand moral, \n\n\"War is bad.\"\n\nAnd the problem is, is that keeps hammering it in. And I just want to smack this film left and right all because of it.\n\n\"Yes, we get it now, war is bad. PLEASE MOVE FORWARD! GO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEBODY'S LIFE!\"\n\nThe first time I watched it, I thought it was good that it was trying to do something new and inventive.\nThe second time years later, I thought it was trying to prove a point, but then I realized that it kept hammering the story in with bland, wooden characters especially the teenage boy, he is an absolute stubborn moron! Then I watched it the third time in Japanese, *for review*, which made no difference other than that it was in Japanese. And they kept hammering that old message it in. This film, I think is more so centered on to kids and teenager then it is to adults, and I think that one of the greatest things I've seen with this movie, is that this is what it could be seen as generally, a history lesson as to what the characters mean and what people in Japan were going through.\n\nI had to watch a couple reviews as to understand why some people liked this film and why some people didn't. Was it the characters? The visuals? The message? What was it? What was so great about it? Then I watched Roger Ebert's review of it, and how it made one of his great movies of all time and gave the film a 4 star rating. Stating, \n\n\"Now that it's available on DVD with a choice of subtitles or English dubbing, maybe it will find the attention it deserves. Yes, it's a cartoon, and the kids have eyes like saucers, but it belongs on any list of the greatest war films ever made.\"\n\nAnd unfortunately, that is all Grave of the Fireflies is and ever will be, in my opinion, a history lesson. I even got a person saying that it was \"the greatest film he never wished to see again\", that comment right there, is generally enough of a showstopper for this review to end it off right here. In fact this film was so popular that it even got a live remake in 2005.\n\nIs there anything good in this film? Well for me the animation especially the digitally mastered version is great, the story on a different side of view though contriving is thought-provoking. But other than those two things, I could find anything else to like in this movie. The Japanese dub I'd say is certainly a more watchable experience, and they did make an English redub in 2012, but as I said before, this film is only to exist as a World War II history lesson.\n\nIf you decide to watch it, I guarantee that comment above, you are going to like every word of it. For me, if you like war movies, this probably isn't one of the best war films I've seen,  cause I've seen better. I'm not sure if how well it followed the book and personally I don't care, but,  if you're interested, go right ahead. Who am I to stop you? :P \n\nSorry that my opinion may affect you on this film, but I just didn't like it. There is a lot I had to correct for this review, and let me address that it's gonna be the last time I'm going to watch it.\n\nOn a lighter note, a film was released back to back with this film, what is the film? Well, join me in the next review.\n\nStay Tuned!",

Granted, the Japanese imperialists were making others suffer arguably far worse fates, but the point is more that war brings pain and suffering than anything else.  It isn't about damning the American firebombing, but rather damning the entire concept of war.",

Their stories of sadistic torture and cruelty at the hands of the Japanese soldiers (educated officers and uneducated enlisted men alike) made me wonder what kind of culture they had to treat life so cheaply. Now I understand it a little better. For this film's Director to refute this work as being anti-war is to be compltely unaware of how other eyes in other cultures see such things. I call him a fool in this respect. That lack of awareness speaks of  narrow minds and the old order in Japan that arguably lead to the start of that conflict. As with most of the populace of other Axis countries in WW2, all the time the firebombs raining down onto children and the old belonged to their heroic bombers and in the case of Japan, as long as it was Manchurian (Manchuko) children orphaned and made homeless to then die of starvation they were indifferent to the suffering. It was a glorious, divine war, as this film alludes to in the ordinary citizen's mindset. However, this kind of indifference is seen in how Seita and Setsuko are treated by their own Aunt and by the wider community. The vulnerable cast adrift. It made me reflect on the fact that many British children who were evacuated to so called \"places of safety\" were mistreated by their surrogate families.These two lost Japanese children could have been orphans in any country ripped apart by WW2 or even conflicts of today of course. Jewish, German, Russian, French, Iraqi, Afghan, Syrian. The themes are the same. Loss, privation,death. It's much like the last episode of \"World at War\" when Laurence Olivier lists the fallen of all nations, all equal in death. For this reason films such as this must be claimed by us all so we do not forget the horror of war and its impact upon children particularly. Despite the narrow reading of it's director, this wonderful Firefly has flown from the shadow of his cupped hands and glows even more brightly in its free flight.",

            "content": "When people look at animated movies, it's not strange for them to dismiss them. Many people see these movies as nothing more than \"kid's movies\", and immediately turn to something more \"mature.\" It's a shame many of these animated movies are overlooked as so, as a lot of them are fantastic pieces of film. Grave of the Fireflies can be included in this latter statement. One of Studio Ghibli's lesser known gems, Grave of the Fireflies is fantastically written and directed by Isao Takahata, and manages to be one of the best anti-war movies, and animated movies, of all time.\r\n\r\nGrave of the Fireflies is a rather deep and emotional film. The movie follows a semi-autobiographical story about two siblings in World War II -era Japan: Seita, a 14 year old boy, and his four year old sister, Setsuko. Living in a time of constant air raids and bombings, these children, as well as everyone else in the city of Kobe, have it rough. Food must be rationed, and supplies are hard to come by.\r\n\r\nAfter their mother is mortally wounded and killed in one of the many firebombings experienced in the city, Seita and Setsuko, emotionally wounded by the death of their mother, live with their cruel and unforgiving aunt for a short time. She refuses to ration their rice meals fairly, keeping most of it for herself. Seita and Setsuko then decide to leave and live on their own in the country.\r\n\r\nGrave of the Fireflies is a punishingly emotional film, and with good reason. Unlike the more whimsical films Studio Ghibli would create in the future, Grave of the Fireflies is more grounded and down-to-Earth. The tale of Seita and Setsuko is essentially one of survival, and, although a few scenes go by slowly, the plot and characters are interesting enough to keep you hooked for an hour and a half. By the time the ending sneaks up on you, you'll be crying like there's no tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe movie overall is basically an anti-war movie. Grave of the Fireflies tells just how bad the victims of World War II had it. The movie doesn't make Japan the good guys, or America the bad guys (in fact, you don't see any Americans other than the planes); it tells how, sometimes, the enemies of war can be your fellow citizens and townsfolk.\r\n\r\nLike other Studio Ghibli works, Grave of the Fireflies is wonderfully animated. Environments are very well detailed, making everything crisp and enjoyable to look at. Takahata takes the time to show small little objects in between certain shots: maybe a flower in one, and a firefly in the next. Even the most minuscule details, such as the planes flying overhead and the flames burning in the streets after a bombing, are hauntingly beautiful. The characters themselves also look great. It's especially cool, and saddening, how the characters look when they cry; seeing the tears slowly build up in their eyes is chilling. \r\n\r\nGrave of the Fireflies is one of the most heart-wrenching, achingly sad movies out there. Even though it's release was 25 years ago, the fantastic animation and saddening plot and characters make this worth watching once, even if you can't handle a second screening of this wonderful film.",

But such things are not examined in this \"we are not really the bad guys\" version of Japan's history. Such a retelling of history was so jarring to me that I turned off this movie. Maybe it is a great movie, and yes the innocent suffer greatly during war..but without showing the same suffering outside of Japan the movie ends up lacking balance, it is like a bully crying to a teacher when someone hits them back.",

            "content": "From the moment it was decided that 2Plus2Review was to be themed around WWII for the month of September this movie was my first pick.  Not just because it is widely regarded as one of the most touching war movies ever, anime or otherwise.  But because it's a very Crawf pick.  I love anime, I am a massive Studio Ghibli fan and as often as i have watched it, it manages to touch me every time.\n\nThe 1980's was a boom time for anime.  Studio Ghibli were producing some of their best work and people were going nuts over a boy called Sh√¥tar√¥, speeding round the streets of a metropolis  on his red motor bike, in his red leather \"get-up\", in a movie called Akira.   Anime had hit the big time and gave rise to the Otaku.\n\nThe Grave of the Fireflies was released in the same year as Akira (1988).  Akira was more popular at the box office and still today more widely known - another reason for my selection.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies is a beautiful, touching, delicate, moving, tragic and very human story about the effects of WWII on a Japenese family.  It is not the easiest of films to watch as you are, in all intents and purposes, watching two children die. They are dieing as a result of the international conflict that Japan are a main part of.  I regard Fireflies as one of the most powerful anti-war movies I have seen.  It really does show that in many cases there is nothing bigger, than the little things.   \n\nMy favourite part of the fim is where Seita collects the Fireflies and releases them under the net to amuse his sister.  It also showcases that anime is not always about tenticled aliens, ninjas with seemingly super human powers or humanoid robots (mecha).  In some cases the power of Fireflies caused a major re-thinking of the genre.\n\nI just love this film.  For me it's a ten out of ten (or a 5 / 5 in this case).  I love the animation, which is great (especially considering it was released in '88).  I love the haunting soundtrack.  I love the point of the film.  I love the characters and feel their desperation, fear and torture throughout.  I love the humour and always find myself smiling at Setsuko's comments.  I love that something so gentle can affect you so much.  I love everything about this film.  It's a perfect, pure, fragile and tender gem.  Of all of the films that we have reviewed so far, this is my personal favourite by a mile.",

The story itself was tragic, 'tis true, but I didn't find myself feeling very sorry for them, partly because the brother wasn't very realistically crafted.  Added to that, the voice acting wasn't stellar and the animation was, frankly, rather unimpressive.  Next time I hear that something is 'heart-breaking', 'profoundly beautiful', or 'haunting', I might need to check my resources and see if they also said the same thing about Grave of the Fireflies.",

The conditions were dire, the war tore everything up, and what better way to portray the horror of war through the eyes of two young children, brother and sister? Just watching these two try to survive with whatever they can get  (food and supplies were rationed) was just painful and their eventual end left a massive impact. Its a must watch for anyone, and I mean anyone. Those who complain about Japanese anime being generic/bland/unmovinf or whatever excuse, this in an example that'll prove them wrong!",

Most people like to call this movie a tearjerker, and the statement can't be undermined. But there can also be a different approach to The Grave of the Fireflies. As much as heartbreaking and mournful it is, Isao Takahata shows that even an anime movie can be as graphic and realistic as a feature film. It's not easy to watch the story, but it's enormously pleasant to watch the movie. Those are two different things. And this achievement should put a smile on the face of any movie fanatic.",

There are three things that are simply not done:\n1.Never miss the opportunity to go out.\n2.Miss a homework assignment for a French class\n3.And finally, never ever, under any circumstances, can you show any other emotion, other than laughter, at a film.\n\nLuckily, I had enjoyed a night out with friends and had completed the homework for Madame D'Etreleau a few hours before. However, not following the usual fashion, the film ''Grave of the Fireflies'' has challenged every possible conception in regards to Rule 3 than I thought possible.\n\nThe beginning scenes of the film make little, if any, sense. Quite simply a story that has been cast to the winds of fate, but with every twist of fate that befalls our protagonists, the plot fits so snugly together that I doubt that I will see such a film of this calibre very soon again.\n\nWith every hardship, every swelling moment of joy, the times when it seems the roughest, you are there for every moment, not missing a single discernibly clear emotion.\n\nBy the end of this film, when everything had finally come together, I was physically experiencing great pain. Not only had I arrived to the conclusion of a great film but I had also arrived at a new found appreciation for not just animated films, but hope for every other genre for the medium of film.\n\nIt goes without saying that if I had the great privilege of ever meeting Mr.Hayao Miyazaki, not only would I be able to appreciate that he is indeed a cultural genius but also, I can say with great confidence that he has moved and inspired whomever watches this utterly magnificent and quintessentially superb masterpiece.",

Okay, now that that's out of the way, Grave of the Fireflies is a really great drama that illustrates the tragedies of war on a very personal level. It takes place in 1945 Japan shortly before their surrender, and tells the story a brother and sister, Seita and Satsuko, who are left to struggle for their survival without a home or anybody to care for them. The scarce rationing of food is far from enough to feed them and they are completely abandoned by the world around them. This is as dark as an animated movie can be. However, the relationship between Seita and Satsuko makes it more than just a downer of a movie; it's very beautiful and very emotional, at times overwhelmingly so. The story seems to unfold at a slow pace, with the characters simply wandering aimlessly and looking for food at times, but eventually I realized that the movie isn't so much slow-paced as it is different. The focus of the movie is the close bond between Seita and Satsuko and how they struggle together and care for each other despite their tragic circumstances. The only thing they have left in the world is each other, and it shows through their interactions. Then just when you think it can't get sadder, it gets much sadder. I won't give away what happens because that would pretty much kill the emotional experience of the movie, but it's devastating. There's really no reason not to watch Grave of the Fireflies. It's definitely a tough movie to watch, but it's also beautiful and unforgettable. Your tear glands will thank you.",

I don't want to watch it again because I don't want to cry again, but I will say this: a fantastic movie and one of the best I've ever seen.\n\nTo think that a movie this compelling and deep actually came out of Studio Ghibli's lineup of normally pleasant and heartwarming films. Honestly, this is a movie that will trump any other film of the war genre out there. I will even go so far as to say that this was better then All Quiet on the Western Front.\n\nIt shows a completely different side to the war that a lot of us from this generation will never be able to understand, and hopefully not. But you invest so much of yourself in this movie it's like you're living in it and before you know it, you're tearing up and unable to stop. This one gets my coveted thumbs up, along with other master pieces of the same studio.",

She dies soon after, and the two orphans then live with an unfriendly woman. They find life hard with her as she is a real bitch. Then, it was decided by them to move out and to find a new home. That's when the tragic stuff really kicks in. I cried buckets in this. It's got a lot more to do with the pain that war causes rather than te fighting.

To put it bluntly, this is basically an animated, Japanese version of something you may have seen come out of the neo-realist movement in postwar Italy, and it is amazing. The story envelopes you and makes you at times forget that you are watching a film released in 1988 when computer animation in films was a thing of the future for the most part.",

            "content": "Graves of the Fireflies shows an interesting aspect to World War II. I thought it was interesting how they present a family of children who come from a family of what was considered the privileged in Japan during World War II to children who live in poverty.\nI never would have considered that a military family was typically considered a family that was privileged living in one myself.  \n\nI'm not into anime too much because the artwork looks very 2-dimensional with overlapping figures on top which does not appeal to me personally.\n\nWhat got me was a scene after they had sold their mothers commonas for rice. Once they get the rice the aunt says you can have all the rice you want then suddenly without any new information presented to saying you children are so selfish for asking so much of me having me do all this work. You have to work for what you do. It was like what just happened here. This scene was so random to go from one extreme to the next within the same conversation. I just found that a little odd and presented the aunt as two faced. I didn't get why the aunt was being so rude to their Setsuko and Seita after loosing their mother in an air-raid \n\nAnother thing which got me was durring a conversation the aunt ask Seita how come he has not gone back to school it has been ten days. To me it would be natural to automatically just got to a new school which has not been bombed. \n\nOne thing which I didn't like in the film were the odd spots to suddenly have a music score put in. Two I didn't feel like there was much music in the film and they could added more musical score to the film. I thought that the film needed more music when it came to the bombing scenes and emotional scenes and their just wasn't any music at all during those scenes just sound effects which I felt made the scenes very dull. Three I didn't think that the music matched up well to a war related film. \n\nMy favorite kinds of scenery environments seen through the film were the rainy scenes. \n\nThis film was good at presenting the difficulty in gaining any food towards the end of the war. \n\nOne thing which was presented in this film which I did not realize was happening in Japan during World War II was that there were difficulties finding hardware like for cooking stoves because many Japanese had to give it up to use for the military war effort which to me essentials like that and a family having to give it up seemed to extreme. \n\nOne thing Setsuko says to Seita which I did not know is that sitting a particular way in Japanese culture while eating shows manors which I did not know before watching the film. \n\nI found it odd when Setsuko and Seita found a dead body on the beach that had his head covered and flies were flying around that they did not tell someone off the beach that their was a dead man or barry him themselves to avoid be contaminated. \n\nI was surprised by how many airraides were presented from so early on in the film. I thought most of the air-raides that occured Japan happened at the end of the war. \n\nWhile Seita is looking at fireflies he is reminded on what he calls a Navy Review which I guess is the Japanese navy equivalent to air shows in America. Navy Reviews consist of ships decorated in lights and fireworks. \n\nI surprised how this film presents Seita and Setsuko going from urban city's, beaches, farms. I would have expected to see kids to not go to so many types of landscapes on their own and would have stayed relatively close to relatives whom they would have known. \n\nI was kind of surprised that Setsuko and Seita were not getting sick from unsanitary water by the pond they were living by towards the end of the film. Since they were drinking, taking baths, and cooking using that water. \n\nI became surprised how desperate Seita was getting by having steal from farms or other homes during airraides. \n\nit was sad seeing Setsuko with rashes on her back, salt hurt her and suffering from malnutrition. Setsuko became so desperate for food that she began to believe that dirt that was stuck together was rice and marbles were fruit candy. Then Setsuko dies of Malnutrition. \n\nThis film became an insight to me on how Japanese culture do barrel rights with a box filled with the persons most cherished belongings in the box. The Box with the person and their belongings are put on top of several charcoals for a cremation. \n\nThis film did follow the Japanese concepts which relate to its culture such as impermanence (√ß¬°√•¬∏¬∏ muj√Ö?), transience, Wabi-sabi, mono no aware which the japanese hold deer. These ideas are represented since all of Seita's nuclear family dies by the end of the film. Also they represented after Setsuko dies they show a flashback of her playing around before she died.",

It really makes you rethink what animation can be and I wish we had more movies like this here in the US. It's about two young siblings trying to survive on their own in Japan during World War II and it really showcases exactly what can happen to civilians during a time of war. It is based on a true story which makes this movie (and the saddest ending ever) even more poignant. It's a film everyone should probably see but few will really appreciate. It is very slow moving with a minimal plot and they give away the ending at the very beginning which I did not like. Still a movie worth seeing at least once.",

            "content": "I will definitely give Grave of the Fireflies credit for one thing.  After watching it for the first time, the lump in my throat was enough to force to me to put on another DVD that was the complete opposite just to restore some sense of normality to my life.  That DVD was Chris Rock: Bigger and Blacker.  Make what you will of that choice. \n\nI should be really clear about some things before I review this film - most importantly, you need to know that 4 stars is a seriously high mark for a film coming from me.  Out of about 850 rated films, less than 40 have a score this high.  So obviously, I absolutely adore this film (at a rough count it's my 19th favourite film) and given a level playing field I should only be praising it.....and yet, this film comes with an outrageous reputation.  Best film in the Ghibli canon.  Best anime film ever.  Best Japanese film since Kurosawa.  It comes with reviews like 'if you don't cry when you watch this, you have no feelings'.  None of these things are true.  Yet, I basically believed all of them before even seeing one second of this film.  Such is the reputation and the baggage this film carries with it - any reasonable review needs to acknowledge that.  So rather than explaining why it's good enough for four stars, it's more important for me to explain why it's not worth the five I was so sure I'd give it once I'd seen it. \n\nSo, to explain that, I'm going to explain the two different, significant ways I reacted to this film. \n\nFirstly, there's something a little unsavoury about the way Grave of the Fireflies has been canonized.  Really, the reaction that a lot of people have to this film is heavily informed by the snotty, dismissive attitude a lot of people in the Western world have towards anime, and to a lesser extent, Japanese culture in general.  What makes that worse is that those who love anime are even more guilty of this than the people that hate it.  If somebody hates anime and hails this as some kind of exception to the rest of the genre, that's fair enough - you'll know straight away and you can dismiss them accordingly.  But it's the people that love anime, the people who feel like they need to impress the people that hate it, that have ramped up this film's reputation.   \n\nThat typical, mildly offensive insult found on music forums - 'rap music for white people' - really applies here, as hard as it is to say that.  That's not the film's fault at all - it certainly doesn't pander to a Western audience, and if it did I'd probably hate it - but the storytelling here, despite the presence of the most innocent child in any Ghibli film in Setsuko, leaves no room for the wide-eyed, kaleidoscopic visuals, characters, and plots that makes up the very best anime moments.  Those things are the very same things that make a lot of people outside of Japan dismiss anime as childish, annoying, and shallow; so if they're not present here, surely this film must be the first one we should recommend to anime haters, right?  'Hey, not all anime is like that, try watching this!' \n\nI don't like that attitude.  By buying into that thought process, the anime lovers have unwittingly conceded that there's something wrong with anime - a recommendation of Grave of the Fireflies to a newcomer or a hater is an implicit slap in the face to Paprika, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, 5 Centimeters per Second, Akira, and just about every other Studio Ghibli film.  Watching this, with no experience of any other anime, would give you an impression so misleading that it would be worthless.  Treated as a one-off, an unusually depressing, bleak anime film, Grave of the Fireflies is little short of a masterpiece.  Sadly, a lot of people don't treat it that way.\n\nMy second reaction is this: Setsuko's death, when I look at it objectively, is the most tragic I've ever seen in any film, and by quite some distance.  And yet, while it had me on the edge of my seat, it didn't make me cry. \n\nI guess there's a few ways to explain that.  Firstly, you see it coming - the opening line of the film announces that Seita will die, and when you think about it, the idea of Setsuko NOT dying is even more tragic and unthinkable.  Secondly, it has to be ranked as one of the unceremonious deaths in cinema history, with nothing to announce it beyond the line 'she never woke up'.  The score doesn't even swell emotionally in the way you'd expect; in fact, there might not even be any music playing at all at that point.  You aren't even given any time to reflect on it - within seconds, he's going to the city to cremate her. \n\nAnd yet, I find myself comparing this to some of the movie scenes that have made me cry.  The most recent was the incinerator scene in Toy Story 3, and that comparison is illuminating, because it makes absolutely no sense.  On one hand, you have characters that aren't even human, characters that don't display any great emotion over the three films that build up to that point, charcaters that ultimately live in a fantasy world with only a shallow resemblance to the real world, characters that the viewer really have no reason to be emotionally invested in.  On the other hand, you have a little girl who has to endure an unbearably depressing and short life, who isn't old enough to have done anything to deserve it, and who, thanks to the scenes that show her playing with Seita and digging a literal grave for some literal fireflies while innocently questioning the fleeting nature of life itself, is unquestionably a more three-dimensional construction than anybody in Toy Story.  So why did the sight of all the toys - toys, remember, not humans - linking hands and descending to their ultimately irrelevant ends move me more than the sight of Setsuko eating dirt and marbles because she's starving to death? \n\nI can't answer that.  I wouldn't even know where to begin explaining it.  Yet the reason seems a little irrelevant; the reality is that Grave of the Fireflies, despite all its best efforts, did not move me to tears.  And that, to me, feels like a significant failure on the part of Isao Takahata.  It's not enough to make it a bad film, or even enough to stop it being a classic - but it is enough to stop it being the best Ghibli film. \n\nThat's my reasoning for a rating that others will probably see as too harsh, anyway.  It's a beautful film though, and not only do I think it's absolutely masterful, I doubt I'll forget the way it made me feel.",

            "content": "Wow, what can I say about this film? I've seen a couple of Studio Ghibli films (the ones you'd expect; Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro), this was completely different. Where those films create an imaginary world for us to escape into, safe in the knowledge this isn't a reality we'll ever suffer, Grave of the Fireflies gives us a very real (and still relevant) subject matter.\n\nSet in Japan during the second world war, Grave of the Fireflies follows the lives of a young brother (Seita) and sister (Setsuko) as they deal with the loss of war. Their mother is killed during an air raid and their father is away fighting in the war, this leaves them pretty much alone. It's easy to forget Seita is just a child himself as he stays strong in order to look after his younger sister, but we do see his vulnerability a couple of times.\n\nThe story is told through flashbacks with Seita looking back at this traumatic part of his life as he and Setsuko deal with starvation and being orphans. The relationship he has with his sister is special and it reminded me a lot of my relationship with my own sister, with whom I share a similar age gap. This helped me empathise with the characters more than I thought possible, and made the film somehow real to me even though I have never experienced anything even remotely similar.\n\nWe are prepared for the inevitable from the start as we already know the fate of our protagonists but it is still very hard to watch. If you are the sort of person who cries at the drop of a hat I recommend you prepare yourself early. If you're like me and class yourself as a heartless bastard, still get ready for the worst as I can't think of anyone who could survive this film. And yes, you read that right, Grave of the Fireflies is now  the only film to bring me close to tears in my adult life (I managed to fight them off, but it was touch and go). In fact you would have to be one tough and heartless person to not feel even remotely moved by this incredible film",

            "content": "In 1988, around the time of Miyazaki's classic \"My Neighbor, Totoro'' Isao Takahata made an equally successful anime film that easily captured the same quality and charisma but through a different light.  Many themes of family, potential loss, sickness, and caring from Totoro are present in Grave of the Fireflies.  This movie focuses more more on such things in a time of hardship and war.  Not from an everyday view of life with fantasy blended in.  One can safely consider this movie the yang to Totoro's yin.\n\nThe movie takes place in the backdrop of Japan's involvement in WWII.  Two siblings: Seita and his younger sister Setsuko are sent off by their mother to sanctuary during the bombing raids.  After the loss of their mother and departure of their dad in the Japanese Imperial Navy they are taken in by their harsh aunt.  After leaving to live on their own both endure the hardships of society and nature but have the familial love to back each other up.\n\nThe movie is entirely a flashback told by Seita's ghost.  We see him die in the first few minutes of the film and from there it's all a motioned slideshow of everything leading up to the current circumstances.  Despite being told entirely in flashback the narrative consists of very few lines of first-person monologue.  The majority of the movie is told like a series of pictures set into motion.\n\nMost of classic Japanese cinema has been categorized as Art House.  As with any movie by directors like Kobayashi, Kurosawa, Ozu, Ichikawa, Oshima, and the like anime mostly encompasses the artistic approach of how to present and tell a story.  Like Miyazaki, Takahata uses a more liberal approach in storytelling.  His focus is more on the feelings and attitudes of the characters in response to their changing circumstances.  Unlike Miyazaki, Takahata doesn't use fantasy to convey feelings but instead uses realism to convey his thoughts.\n\nDespite being friends with Miyazaki and having collaborated with him on the classic \"Laputa: Castle in the Sky'' Takahata admits not being a fan of fantasy.  I believe that any method of conveying feeling through art can work if the director is effective in engulfing the viewer.  Grave of the Fireflies is very great at this dynamic.\n\nLike with art, many scenes in this movie are very effective at instilling emotional reactions within the viewer.  Many people, especially friends of mine, were moved to tears by this movie.  I admit that I wasn't one of them but there were many impacting scenes that affected me so much in different ways to where I found disliking this movie impossible.  Two examples are the part where Seita and Setsuko spend time with one another under the night sky and Setsuko gets excited when she sees swarms of fireflies hovering around.  Another is the scene where Seita gets abused by a violent farmer for stealing some of his crop for his sickly sister.  These examples are artistic segments that gave me a sense of charm and a sense of anger.  Hence making the characters involving.\n\nWhile considered a war movie by many Grave of the Fireflies has no combat footage.  Most of it is reduced to bombing raids.  There have been many war movies that have succeeded on an emotional level than an action one.  Examples are: ''The Deer Hunter\", ''Das Boot\", ''Mrs. Miniver\", ''Since You Went Away\", ''The Human Condition\", \"Fires of the Plain\", ''Schindler's List\", and so on.  Grave of the Fireflies has wonderfully secured its place within the status of these movies.\n\nAnother great aspect is the soundtrack.  Every track is wonderfully played and and synched with each scene.  Neither one fails in contributing to displaying each respective emotion.  The animation and character designs are also wonderful and fare just as well as everything else in this movie.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies is one of those movies that proves the artistic potential of anime and why I'm a fan/admirer of the genre.  One almost always has to look at it through an artistic perspective and not a view of technical sophistication.  That being said, I do not believe all anime is good.  I have seen really bad anime in my years of viewing it.  Anime does have its fair share of fans and critics.  As Roger Ebert said in his interview,\"If the story is working, the characters are involving, and the artistic imagination is there then those stylistic details become less important.  Art doesn't focus on technical excellence, but how it makes you feel.\"",

This is no heroic tale of differing ideologies and factions, this is a very emotionally-taxing tale set in the waning days of WWII that will leave you feeling depressed as a brother and sister are physically and emotionally worn-away by the cold world that deprived them of their parents. Be sure to have plenty of tissues upon viewing this tear-jerking masterpiece. Can't believe this was released together with 'My Neighbor Totoro' (practically the happiest movie ever made).

The animation is excellent and the direction from Isao Takahata is superb and he is one of my favorite anime directors, but it is its score imbued with a haunting quality to it that makes those tragic scenes even more unbearable to watch.

This film is about family and the love and the ties that bind a family together. It is a genteel film that does however show graphically the ravages of war and it aftermath. \n The characters try everything to survive but luck is not with them. You learn by the end why the two ghosts are telling this story. \n Yes it will bring you to tears. I suggest having the Kleenex close by. \n  It very quickly became one of my favorite of all time films.

This isn't a pixie dust fantasy, or a heightened sc-fi anime, it's one of the most touching, poignant, and stark anti-war films ever made.\n\nBut to call Grave of the Fireflies purely an anti-war film is perhaps too simplistic (director Isao Takahata dismisses that label entirely). This film is gentle and poetic, more than it is violent, and it's remarkably restrained in its anti-war message. There's very little in the way of moralizing or polemics (probably because the story doesn't need it).\n\nPerhaps best of all, Setsuko is one of the very, very few (if not the only) animated 4 year-olds who actually behaves like a four year old. I'm so sick of seeing preternaturally smart, sassy, sophisticated and precocious children in Hollywood movies. Setsuko's emotion and behaviors are EXACTLY right for a completely normal four year-old, and recognizing this goes a long way in cultivating a fully realized character. Similarly, Seita is a teenage boy who behaves with the sort of mixture of pride, compassion and hubris you'd expect of someone his age. He still believes that Japan will win the war. He thinks it's up to him to take care of his sister with their mother gone and father who knows where. This leads him to make mistakes: possibly the most obvious one being where he fails to take the farmer's advice, swallow his pride and ask his nasty aunt to take them back in again. \n\nThis film is pretty famous for making people cry. While I didn't have that strong of an emotional connection to it, I appreciated the beauty and honesty it displayed. This wasn't a glossy portrayal of anti-war political statements and heavy handed plot points, it was a simply about a brother and sister coping with the after effects of a city and family destroyed. The fact that Grave is a semi-autobiographical apology to Takahata's deceased sister makes it all the more powerful.",

The enjoyment, or as close as it gets, is in seeing an oft-told story from a completely new and painfully authentic point of view. As with most Japanese animation, the film places an emphasis on environmental details and leaves the people abstract, to where the characters take on an every-person appearance. As with Art Spiegelman's Maus the story is personal, with a nearly uncomfortable intimacy, but appearance is universal. To its credit there is no whitewashing, yet the sheer abundance of Setsuko cuteness make the film feel as though it's trying too hard to be sad. It's rare that war films focus on the ground level, the human effect beyond soldiers and their families, the pure victims. Therein lies Fireflies' strength: perspective. As intimate as it is, everything else feels less significant.",

Meaning if you have a sister or a brother you can almost feel the pain the older brother feels when his sister dies and the guilt he must feel from how he \"Wasn't responsible enough to look after her\", which isn't true but when you look at how he was older then her and all you can feel the \"Responsibility\" he has when his parents die, I was very moved by this film and alot of times I was very saddened by it. I watched this film and by the end of the film I was in tears. \nThe film takes place during WW2 and the bombing of where a young boy named Seita and his little Sister Setsuko are evicted from there home shortly before the bombings in Japan,They where living with their Aunt who resented them for eatting her food and not doing anything to earn it so she kicked them out, and must live in a warn torn down factory,wich was made worse after the bombings, as they live there though things gradually get worse for them having little to no food they must survive on candy until the brother decided to with raw all the money from their parents saving and go buy food so that they will survive. Upon doing this and getting food Seita sees a TV news artical saying Japan had surrendered to the Allied powers, Wich meant that his father who was in the Navy was probably dead, Upon hearing this he's distraught and takes his time getting the much need food back to his sister. Unfortunately in this time his sister has gotten worse from Malnutrition and by the time he's back she's so far gone and is hallucinating. \nIn a panic he tries to cook food for her as quickly as possible but unfortunately it is too late and she dies. \n\nI honestly was crying,I'm crying now as I write this too actually, during the film and especially during his little sisters death that I was just...beside my self. This film was so powerful and so heart wrenching that it brought me to tears. Seeing the boy loose his sister I could really relate to,having three sisters myself and one of whom unfortunitly had died, I know/knew the pain this brother was going through. I know the films meant as an anti-war film but really it's more of a film about the loss of a loved one and the \"Failure\" you feel of how you couldn't stop it. Apparently it took the man this story is about, Akiyuki Nosaka, 23 years till he could forgive him self for \"Killing his sister\" and I say |I forgive you and it wasn't your fault.\" People MUST watch this film and really if you don't cry you're heartless.",

Being unwelcome and criticized, Seita decided to move once more and they choose the caves on the hills as their new house. There, they enjoy the light of the fireflies. \nBut as the war continues, food becomes scarce. Pure out of desperation to feed Setsuko and himself, Seita starts stealing crops. But unfortunately the health of Setsuko is deteriorating fast due to malnutrition. Her smiles and laughs are gone; instead she becomes more and more quiet...\n\nThe emotional story unfolds itself very slowly. A lot of effort is put in the seemingly unimportant events, which gives the characters more depth. It's great to see how Seita copes with the situation at hand. He has to be strong, not only for himself, but also for Setsuko. \nIt's rare to see so much beauty in an animation. There are some breathtaking and dramatic scenes, which I won't spoil of course. It's safe to say, this animated movie will move you, it's that real!\n\nRating: PG / 6",

The realism also helps to identify its standing among anti-war films which many of them often rely on its eloquent ideas about war. Aside from that, I think the filmmakers has succeeded in creating a remarkable work that raises among the audience a tendency to love-hate the characters and subsequently, the themes carried on within the story. The animation work is so lovely and at times, the images are both incredibly stunning and heartwarming. I was deeply moved by the voice acting that determines the importance to deliver the messages verbally and symbolically. Overall, it's not an exaggeration if I say the film is a masterpiece, looking at its powerful impact and everlasting legacy to its own circle of enthusiasts.",

I've seen a couple of Studio Ghibli films (the ones you'd expect; Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro), this was completely different. Where those films create an imaginary world for us to escape into, safe in the knowledge this isn't a reality we'll ever suffer, Grave of the Fireflies gives us a very real (and still relevant) subject matter.\n\nSet in Japan during the second world war, Grave of the Fireflies follows the lives of a young brother (Seita) and sister (Setsuko) as they deal with the loss of war. Their mother is killed during an air raid and their father is away fighting in the war, this leaves them pretty much alone. It's easy to forget Seita is just a child himself as he stays strong in order to look after his younger sister, but we do see his vulnerability a couple of times.\n\nThe story is told through flashbacks with Seita looking back at this traumatic part of his life as he and Setsuko deal with starvation and being orphans. The relationship he has with his sister is special and it reminded me a lot of my relationship with my own sister, with whom I share a similar age gap. This helped me empathise with the characters more than I thought possible, and made the film somehow real to me even though I have never experienced anything even remotely similar.\n\nWe are prepared for the inevitable from the start as we already know the fate of our protagonists but it is still very hard to watch. If you are the sort of person who cries at the drop of a hat I recommend you prepare yourself early. If you're like me and class yourself as a heartless bastard, still get ready for the worst as I can't think of anyone who could survive this film. And yes, you read that right, Grave of the Fireflies is now  the only film to bring me close to tears in my adult life (I managed to fight them off, but it was touch and go). In fact you would have to be one tough and heartless person to not feel even remotely moved by this incredible film",

Everyone in every goverment in every country should watch this film so they can look at war and say, \"Never again.\"",

Grave of the fireflies is a touching story bad on the bombing of 1945 in Japan, and it was great to see the Japanese perspective. Sure it was okay for the other countries, but all those innocent Japanese people. I watched this film english dubbed, and there really wasn't much dialogue in this film. In the beginning of the film we meet two characters. A young boy called Seita, and his younger sister Setsuko.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the film, it is very tragic. The Japanese town we see is blown up, and pure Seita and Setsuko are left with her mother in a horrible state. Meanwhile heir father is out fighting in the navy. So Seita and his sister has to live with someone. They stay with a woman who eventually nags at the two of them, and Seita decides that he and his sister can live outside the rationing system. So they live in a place near a riverside and then all the bad things happen.\r\n\r\nI'm not usually a big fan of anime movies, but this one I thought was great. A touching, heck, even heartbreaking and beautiful story altogether. Well worth checking this one, but beware, the cry factor is high!\r\n\r\nThis is one of the few films that don't have a happy ending so I shall not spoil it for you, but I tell you this. It's a truthful story with hard drama, and what really gives it edge is how it is based off a true event. It shows what kind of troubles the Japanese people must have faced during and after the bombing of 1945.",

One the one hand, their mother passed away due to excessive burns inflicted by the American fire-bombing, and on the other hand their father was serving in the Japanese navy but never responded to any of the letters they send him. As a result the two children were left alone to fight for their life.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/474/graveofthefireflies06.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis animation is an adaptation of the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Akiyuki Nosaka, as a way to redeem himself for the death of his own sister due to malnutrition during the war in 1945. written and directed by Isao Takahata.Through this tragically beautiful animation we observe the cruelty of a war, and any war to be frankly, and the price for those who are left behind. We see the dark sight with the aircrafts terrifying people from the sky, the constant bombardments, the destruction of buildings and people's spirit, the endless starvation, and death that seems to be their only salvation. In addition, we get to observe how these two children find strength and courage from each other, and make it through as far as possible. Their pure hearts will even let them have some moments of amusement, even if some try to take their innocence away. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img846.imageshack.us/img846/6002/graveoffirefliesxl01.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAnother excellent feature of it, is the all around scenery. Red and black shades are very evident from beginning to end, and overall the anime brings you the feeling you get on a cloudy stormy day. Its a mixture of sadness, as well as hope for some sun-rays to finally show up. The scenes with the fireflies are magical and also have a symbolic meaning due to their short life span, but I won't say anything more on the subject.  \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img846.imageshack.us/img846/6268/firefliesw.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nLastly, some interesting trivia, is that it was debuted in Japanese theaters as a double feature with \"My Neighbor Totoro\" which was probably done because otherwise this rather depressing film with its emotionally charged theme wouldn't have made it. Actually even in combination with the lighthearted Totoro, it didn't go well since many considered it too dramatic for their children to watch. Its indeed a heartbreaking film, but personally I recommend it as an amazing anti-war film which presents actual events in a very honest and believable way that educates and informs people to avoid war at any cost ;)",

No film, animation or live-action, out there has the simplicity of a thought yet the depth it made results to such a wide array of emotion that leaves you not questioning it but rather, trying to forget it.\" -Paulo Gabuat",

However, their relationship with their aunt deteriorates and Seita and Setsuko decide to leave and fend for themselves.  They find a place and things seem to be going well.  However, over time food gets scarcer and life becomes a constant struggle for survival...\n\nA quite powerful examination of life among the civilian population of a nation at war.  More broadly, this is a story of survival and the bonds between a brother and sister, made stronger by a cataclysmic series of events.   The war is just the setting, and the initial cause of the events - at its core it's a human drama.  This is good, as the movie could easily have gone down some sort of bleeding heart anti-war path or even a path that condemned the US bombing of Japanese cities in WW2 (which would have been absurd as the Japanese were just reaping the whirlwind after sowing the wind).\n\nIncredibly engaging.  You are emotionally invested in the lives of Seita and Setsuko, their struggles and wins, highs and lows.  This makes the conclusion very emotional.\n\nSuperb animation, though you would expect nothing less from director Isao Takahata (director of the TV series Heidi and Maya, amongst others).  Some of the imagery is stunningly beautiful, like watercolour paintings.\n\nOn the negative side, and probably the only reason I didn't give this a 10/10, the outcomes are a bit telegraphed.

            "content": "Without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen this year, or any other year, this animated Japanese classic tells the story of a pair of orphans following the firebombing of Kobe at the end of World War II. It is also a wonderful demonstration of the potential of anime-a serious art form that is at least as versatile as live action, and equally capable of telling true, touching human stories.\n\nThe film opens with a ghostly montage that hints at the fate of the teenage Seita and his younger sister Setsuko, before an extended sequence showing an American attack on their home town. The wooden buildings catch fire from a myriad of phospherous canisters dropped from planes in an eeriely beautiful firestorm. The two find out that their mother didn't survive the attack and leave for their aunt's home. When things don't work out, they take up refuge in an abandoned bomb shelter.\n\nBased on the novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, \"Grave of the Fireflies\" takes tremendous care to illustrate the everyday details of life during war time. It is an interesting paradox of animation that in the right hands, it can be more realistic than life action: the sparsity of the images heighten certain details-the cooking of rice, a bubble caught in the clothes of a little girl in a bathtub, the candy drops rattling in their metal container.\n\nAs far as anime' goes, this is about as unconventional as it gets. No cute perky teenage girls in schoolgirl costumes flying around the galaxy, no ultra-grim and over-stylized cybernetic ninja bloodbaths. This feels about as real as real can get, and if you'll pardon the trite phrase, it's often so real it hurts. There is nothing flashy about Grave of the Fireflies, nor is there any attempt to push an anti-American sentiment (in fact, much of the film's condemnation seems to be towards the cold Japanese society that let these two kids fall through the cracks of the world). And while there are moments of happiness, as we get to share in the love between Seita and Setsuko, the sense of impending loss is at times almost too keen to bear. Setsuko is as adorable, playful, and headstrong as any real child, and her suffering is as equally heartbreaking. Likewise, seeing Seita's brave face crumble as he confronts the hopelessness of their situation over and over again is truly astounding.\n\n\"Grave of the Fireflies\" is certain to elicit tears from just about anybody. With the careful, quiet deliberation of the best Italilan neo-realism, it lays out its heartbreaking story. Never resorting to sentimentality or manipulative tricks, the film instills achingly real sorrow for the orphans' fate.\n\nI should underline that \"Grave of the Fireflies\" is certainly not recommended for younger viewers. It doesn't avert its gaze from the bloody stumps and burnt-out eyes of the childrens' mother, or a little girl's last, laboured breaths. \n\nOne of the most devastating anti-war films ever made, animated or otherwise, \"Grave of the Fireflies\" takes courage to watch but rewards it in spades. Lovely and heartbreaking, bracing and human, \"Grave of the Fireflies\" will stay with you.",

Soon inflation settled in and unemployment prevailed.\r\n\r\nThen in Germany, a new political movement promised employment for all! They indeed provided that- however, at the price to boot up a big military industry, and build concrete roads primarily designed for tanks.\r\n\r\nJapanese immigrants were rejected in the USA, and then soon they joined the Germans in their rush for world domination.\r\n\r\nIn the end the price the japanese people paid was far too high, and to top up on that, America gave the holocaust survivers a \"white-letter\" of innocence, and built a nation for them initially just on paper.\r\n\r\ntotally ignoring the problems that existed before the war and that caused heavy problems.\r\n\r\nNonetheless it is true that human rights were grossly violated and there is no excuse for that.\r\n\r\nHere you see the \"human rights\" situation from the viewpoint of the japanese youths, not given a choice but forced into the scenario.\r\n\r\nTo prevent that such a war which had bad strategy will happen again, all aspects must be researched, how the atrocities became thinkable, for instance, and what was the situation before the war started.\r\n\r\nOne viewpoint is that initially, after 1860 during the Meiiji restauration, Japan opened its borders and invited scientists, engineers and the like, however, it is now known they can be cold-hearted, and at places where they prevail, soldiers and their merchants are not absent.\r\n\r\nDid you even know that Japan experiemented with democracy in the 1900s to 1920s?

It also delves deeply into themes of isolation and is one of the most thought-provoking, haunting films I've ever had the pleasure to watch.\r\n\r\nLet me start off by saying that Grave of the Fireflies is, by far, the most mature, down-to-Earth animated film I've seen in my life. Unlike most animated movies which draw the viewers' attention with whimsical characters and slapstick humor, Miyazaki chose a powerful story with shocking images instead. There's no epic battle scenes, no explosions; its simplicity is really what drives it to greatness.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the visuals are nothing to get excited about. The colors are very neutral and dull. But that's the thing; it doesn't need vivid colors and flashy gimmicks for it to work. In fact, the dull colors only benefit the film, as it adds to the gloomy, melancholy atmosphere. However, occasionally, there are some truly beautiful scenes such as any of the scenes involving fireflies, which were incredibly breathtaking. \r\n\r\nThis movie isn't for everyone, especially children. Like I said, kids just won't be interested by the visuals, won't be able to appreciate the story and will most likely be traumatized by the constant images of death. However, if you're above the age of about 13, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Not only does it further prove that Studio Ghibli has a knack for producing beautiful, wholly entertaining masterpieces, but it also proves that animation, as a whole, is not just for children.\r\n\r\n(Btw, if you're planning on watching it, I suggest you watch it in Japanese with subtitles. Setsuko's voice can be a little annoying when dubbed in English)",

This, although understandable due to the sadder side that Grave of the Fireflies brings to the table, is arguably a more well rounded story and should be on everyone's list of anime films to see.\r\n\r\nStarting off with a family in Japan during World War II, the bond between brother and sister is instantly there to see and is the main focal point of the feature. This is a relationship that everyone can see in their own lives, if you have siblings or not there will always be someone who in that situation you would protect and do absolutely anything for. \r\n\r\nAfter the death of their mother and the terrible treatment their relatives show them, they have no choice but to go it alone. Surviving on scraps of food, morsels they can steal and barter for. All seems to be going well for a while until the plot starts to thicken.\r\n\r\nComplications in their lives become apparent, without substantial nourishment and proper shelter they struggle to stay well. \r\n\r\nThe end is expected but nonetheless can't help but bring a tear or more to the eye of any human, although strangely, it is not entirely out of sadness that you cry. Their horrendous ordeal to survive is over. I have yet to meet someone who it hasn't touched and reaffirmed to them how important family and friends are in their lives. \r\n\r\nFilms depicting family bonds and sibling dependency are not uncommon but where some only scratch the surface Grave of the Fireflies brings a whole new side to the idea and will leave you with a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nEven if you don't enjoy films that leave you in tears then this is a must watch Ghibli classic. Go home, get some ice cream, find someone you love and watch for 89 minutes of story telling mastery.",

            "content": "This film really surprised me. I don't think I have ever seen such a haunting, moving and beautiful film before and it's from an anime, on that list that you guys recomended to me.\r\n\r\nSet in Japan during WWII, Grave Of The Fireflies tells the story of Seita and his little sister Setsucko and after their mum is killed in an air raid while their farther is serving in the Navy, they are left to fight for survival in the Japanese countryside. Food is scarce. Even their relatives are too focased on there own survival to look after them. Seita looks after his sister and he tries hard to protect her from the horrors of war. He will do anything to get food and his sister is his main concern. The air raid at the beginning of the film is very deverstating and the powerful imagery of a boomed Japanese village is very horrific. Seita and Setsucko are both very likable characters and what they go through is quite horrific aswell. Seita goes through the most, as he tries to protect his sister, does anything to get food and there is the ending; a very moving and haunting ending, which bought tears to my eyes. Setsucko, seems like an annoying kid, but I really liked her, I don't know if it was her voice (I watched the Japanese version, the right version) or her personality, which seemed rather big for a 5 year old, I think she's 5? Not sure. Seita seems my age or abit older.\r\nThe story is very powerful and moving; it's also a fasinaiting tale of a brothers love, set during WWII.\r\n\r\nI only watched the Japanese version, with English subtitles. Not the English dub, because I want to watch it in it's orginal form. The voice acting was outstanding. My favorite voice actor is who-ever voiced Setsucko (sorry, but I can't find the name of the voice actor), this voice actor added lots of personality to her and she sounded very cute and inocent, shame she doesn't understand whats going on around her. I really don't know what else to say about voice acting, I do find it quite hard to review voice acting. But I did like the voice acting, it seemed to suit the characters.\r\n\r\nBeautiful animation, really sets the tone of this gritty tale. It is certianly not a film for kids (its rated 12 here), as the film is filled with quite upsetting war time scenes and deaths. The film has many haunting images, like the ending scene which I won't spoil. And the scene where they relise the fireflies in there bunker and watch them light up the dark space. The air raid scene are beautifully drawn, as the sky goes black and ash cover the scenery. The script is written perfectly, the relationship between Seita and Setsucko is a quite typical brother sister relationship, but because of how young Setsucko is she says something typical of a 5 year old, she is very curious and messes with Seita. Great animation and great production all the round.\r\n\r\nOverall; one of the most moving and human animated films I've seen, with a deep message. My favorite critic Roger Ebert has said that \"Grave of the Fireflies should be put up there with some of the greatest war films ever made\" and he is so right. I look forward to seeing other anime's of this genre. Must See!!!\r\n9.5/10",

Setsuko and Seita are sister and brother who, after just having lost their mother in the American fire bombing of Kobe, set out to survive the war on their own in a besieged, demoralized, and callous Japanese countryside. The whole movie is spent watching them whither, and so is expectedly depressing, with only a few moments of whimsy shining through to lighten things up. Like Pom Poko and to a lesser extent Only Yesterday, two of Isao Takahata's other Ghibli movies, Grave of the Fireflies isn't shy about pushing its message. Its anti-war perspective is narrow and unrelenting, a good thing to be sure. All in all, an emotionally draining portrait of two needless victims of international violence whose stories may be multiplied n times over. Very highly recommended, especially for blockheaded American patriots and WWII buffs who insist on America's moral superiority throughout modern history.",

            "content": "Grave of the Fireflies is heartbreaking tale of wartime violence shattering the delicate lives of two siblings, Setsuko and Seiko, living in Japan during World War II. It gives a chilling depiction of wartime conditions. Aircrafts are seen dropping bombs, raising the casualty count with each raid, and food is rationed because of the country's limited supply. In addition, the events of the film are based on a deceased Seiko's recount of the memories that scar his soul. \r\n\r\nIn the film's initial portrayal of an air raid, the two siblings lose their mother, an event that plunged the two into abysmal hardships. The image of her body, wrapped in bandages and infested by maggots, was certainly traumatic.  \r\nIt was difficult watching Seiko as a preteen forced to prematurely take on the role of the guardian for his younger sister, Setsuko. Without parental figures in their lives, there is really no one left to really care for these children. The relatives they are sent with were cruel and cold, leaving them no choice but to live on their own in an abandoned bomb shelter. Remorse and pity was nonexistent, because everyone was preoccupied with fending for themselves. Seiko and Setsuko unconditional love for each other is heart wrenching as they struggle in a warring world that stripped them of their innocence. \r\n\r\nGrave of the Fireflies is truly a gripping story of war. While its generally a anti-war movie, its primary focus is the children's adventure. The children are aware of the war happening before them; however, their main obstacle, the sole perpetrator for their ailments, is the lack of nutrition, not the war itself. It's an extremely dark animated film with beautiful animation that certainly deserves a watch. These characters are as human as animated characters are allowed to be. Although they are typically good-natured, they aren't given a chance to raise from adversity. There isn't the usual scene of redemption following a happy ending. It's a definite tear jerker, that leaves me asking \"Why do fireflies die so soon?\"",

WWII was the costliest conflict in world history, with millions dead and thousands left to pick up the pieces.\r\n\r\nIn the center of it, are the two children, who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid. Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family, they're sent to live with their aunt, who is at first warm and welcoming to them, but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter. From that point on, the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the better Anime films that I've seen, the animation is beautiful, though not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made). We get a sense of the dread of the two lead characters, who watch as the world around them crumbles into heaps of ashes, and aircraft loom ominously overhead, dropping their deadly, incendiary cargo on unsuspecting Japanese villagers. The director, Isao Takahata, obviously has a special resentment of the war, but manages to avoid condemning it outright. The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children, who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Grave of the Fireflies is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. This film has to be the \"Schindler's List\" of animated pieces. It's brave, it's not overly sentimental, but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality, maybe at times the sadness \r\nfactor can overwhelm you but in all, this is a must-see. \r\n\r\nStory: A\r\nActing: B+\r\nDirection: B+\r\nVisuals: A-\r\nOverall: B+\r\n\r\n***1/2 out of 4 stars",

            "content": "Despite what those pretentious toddlers may believe, life isn't all about the shits and giggles. To the average American, the whole genre of anime is a mangled cluster-fuck of androgynous man-boys powering-up their energy balls for sixteen episodes while talking international politics with their opponents before finally releasing the damn thing in the final chapter-and they're mostly right. In the same way they might trash the bizarre anime clich√©s of pre-teen supermen and tentacle rape, I could attack American cinema for the gratuitous exposure of titties and a liberal understanding of what makes an object flammable-and again, we'd both be right. But Grave of the Fireflies proves that there's more substance in the genre than we're ready to give credit for. This film transcends those cultural and aesthetic differences to achieve some sort of higher truth about the human condition. It doesn't shove a tampon up its plot-hole to soak up these truths into a concentrated dose of metaphor; it deals with complex issues simply and directly. As you've probably noticed from my forcible insertion of humor, I often have trouble praising a movie (especially so serious of a movie) while trying to maintain a comedic tone-but I'm also a terrible person so I'm going to do my best here to stay true to my roots as a jackass.\r\n\r\nGrave of the Fireflies is a story about Japanese civilian life during the final year of World War II. Unaware of the hardships experienced on the warfront during this period, a small village struggles to uphold their way of life against the seemingly spontaneous U.S. incendiary bombing that can occur at any moment. In this harsh climate we find a pair of orphaned children, Seita and his younger sister Setsuko, who drift from one home to another amidst the looming threats of war and starvation. They try to live an innocent life-Setsuko in particular has cheeks rosy enough to suggest the meatier parts of an uncooked steak (or maybe that's just because I'm a recovering pedophile)-but as the pressures of survival continue to chip away at their pride they are eventually reduced to stealing for food, bumming it in an abandoned bomb shelter, and begging for handouts from their locals. After weeks of malnutrition and desperation, the pair die (that's not a spoiler, a narrating Seita says quite clearly in the beginning that they die) and the world moves on; it's impossible to forget a pair of lives when nobody made the time for them in the first place. \r\n\r\nLike most great movies, however, the real story and humanity of the film is in the details. Fireflies excels in its details, both via the story and the animation. When Seita eagerly bites into a lump of freshly boiled rice we see him open his mouth wide and blow quick, exasperated breaths to cool it. A dictatorial aunt pawns their mother's kimonos for food and keeps most of it for herself, proving that even in war something as simple as white rice can be as divisive to a family as who gets stuck playing Luigi in Super Mario Brothers. And if you watch closely you can track the children's progressive malnutrition through the ever-multiplying whelps on their backs. Yet despite all the punctuated bouts of gloom surrounding the children, up until the end their story is primarily about the innocent moments they discover even during the bleakest events. After Setsuko eats her final fruit drop (the last taste of candy she will ever enjoy), Seita fills the empty canister with water and distills a weak tea from the remaining flavor-proving once and for all that the Japanese can fashion tea from literally anything. I honestly can't say whether the innocent moments make the tragic ones bleaker or vice versa. For Seita and Setsuko, they are one and the same.\r\n\r\nAs a cheeseburger-eating American, I find this portrayal of war-torn Japan to be particularly fascinating. We often glamorize war and demonize our opponents to unrealistic proportions, and even though the Japanese military was undeniably imperialistic during this period it's difficult to think about the staggering causalities inflicted on the blameless civilians. In a lot of ways, it reminds me of the documentary The Fog of War which interviewed Robert McNamara about the damage inflicted upon Japan during World War II-only Fireflies takes a more human approach to the issue. It doesn't look at the statistical data of the war, it zooms in on the effects of war on a single family and by tailing them through their private disasters you glimpse a portion of an unfolding national narrative. You sense a growing indifference between the victims of the war and the world around them, as evidenced by a rich family returning home to remark that it \"hasn't changed a bit\" as Seita lumbers back to the shelter after learning of his father's death and Japan's defeat.  Is this the moment when that hardened military discipline his father instilled in him breaks down? Perhaps-this is of course the first time in its national history that Japan has ever surrendered. It is also the moment when Seita realizes how hopeless his sister's situation is, when he discovers her sucking on marbles like fruit drops and rolling up dirt clods for dinner. \r\n\r\nIf Fireflies is recognized for nothing else, it should be for its poignantly memorable scenes that articulate the breadth of a national mood through a single moment: Seita running against a crowd to steal food from the deserted houses, the children playfully collecting fireflies in a net only to find them all dead the next moment, Seita cremating his sister (the only member of his family to receive a proper burial)-moments that elevate a simple collection of cartoons into art. Art that transcends national differences. It's easy to write off anime as the stuff of children and nerdy teens with way too much free time (especially when they die their hair yellow and start using Asian emoticons ^_^ ), but Fireflies defies convention. Despite what they initially promoted it as, this is a movie for adults and should be treated as such (for the love of god, never let a kid watch this movie). It works because it takes its subject and its audience seriously; it never assigns guilt for the suffering but merely relates a personal history as it happened to a real Seita sixty-five years ago. Ironically, only through such an artificial medium was such a human story possible.",

            "content": "Isoa Takahata's \"Grave of the Fireflies\" is a sensitive but devastating expose of the effects of war not often seen in mainstream film, let alone animation, focusing on the innocent victims in Japan during WWII. After their mother dies in the firebombing that destroys their home village of Kobe, Seita and his younger sister Setsuko are left to fend for themselves. Artfully rendered with striking (at times uncompromisingly graphic) imagery, the rather streamlined plot plays out as a series of vignettes. Takahata is not so much concerned with addressing the complex politics of war as he is with simplifying and presenting the cruel toll it takes. The story is simply that of Seita and Setsuko, representative of any war orphans, observing both the daily struggles and pleasures of their vagrant life. Indeed, the heart of this film is in the fleeting but earnest joy that Seita finds for his sister in the simplest of things (a day at the beach, catching fireflies), trying his best to keep the hardships of their war-torn existence from affecting her the way they affect him. Alas, for us the audience, these brief moments of reprieve come attached with a harsh pang of bittersweetness, as the ultimate outcome of Seita and Setsuko's transient lifestyle is implied to us in the film's opening scene. This juxtaposition of the children's happiness against our grim foreknowledge of what's to come makes this as harrowing as any live-action war film you can name. It's a deceptive type of sorrow that sneaks up on you and slowly seeps in over the course of the film's patient but not overly-long runtime, leaving you so emotionally drained by the end that even to cry doesn't quite seem adequate enough to express the crippling grief of this peerless masterpiece.",

I don't mean shows like Bleach or Cowboy BeBop; I mean animated features like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, and so forth. These stand out from the rest of the world of animation. There is not a commercial element to them that isnt foriegn to us. They feel as though more love was painstakingly poured into them than any other film since Fantasia. I caught myself, here. I almost just said that Grave of the Fireflies is no exception, but it is. In a genre of stand-alones it stands alone. While I am not fully prepared to call Grave of the Fireflies the best anime I have ever seen, I have never encountered such a haunting experience in this or any other animated genre. It exists with a sense of purpose that far transcends that of sheer entertainment. There is infact, no conventional entertainment in the film. It's not light and it's not fluffy. It's not imaginative, but it is truly and uncompromisingly visionary. It almost exists to educate. The topics of it's lessons are breathtaking in what they encompass. All the while, it's a tribute. It's atonement. It's depictions of death in such an uncharacteristically real light would be considered morbid but for their vitality. I have never seen an animated film of this sort, and I feel I may never again. It has touched me deeply as an experience. As a film it ranks among the crown jewels of animated features. Grave of the Fireflies is a force amid a genre that is notoriously passive.",

It is the type of movie that can put you in a gloomy mood for days to come, but still you must watch it, if only once.  It is not the typical tear-jerker that manipulates your emotions with sappy sentimentality.  The movie has a Zen-like simplicity to it.  The animation is primitive, with no fancy CGI, and yet it brings out the quiet toughness of the brother and the amiable naivete of the little sister brilliantly.  The story is simple - one about the sufferings experienced by a teenager and his sister during the B-29 bombing raids on Japan in WWII, yet it manages to rip your heart out and tear it into a million pieces.  The movie has little political undertone - the B-29's only appear as faceless drones that rain fire and havoc on the houses below, and there is little condemnation against the American attacks or the Japanese militarism; But if there ever was a Japanese anti-war movie, this is it.  It brings home the point against war in a most raw and powerful way - by depicting the horrible fate suffered by innocent children.",

This is a 100% tear jerker, but the set-up is very controlled Japanese. As far as historically accurate I think a couple of the fighter planes were on the wrong ocean, but from the children¬ís perspective I¬ím not sure it mattered. This is the story of a 4 year old girl Seita and her brother Setsuko who are children of a Japanese destroyer captain who is away fighting in WWII. There mother though loving suffers from a bad heart, so Setsuko does most of the caring for his little sister. The family is well off as were most Japanese officers, but they were not part of the elite of society. The movies open on Setsuko burying all there best stuff in the back yard so it would not be plundered during the air raid. The mother leaves the children to go to the shelter. Setsuko and Seitia stay behind still hiding all there possessions. The fire bombing starts and they rush to the shelter, however there way is blocked and they run to the water front to avoid the fire which decimated there city. Like most of the movie the story is honest not embellished take on there life in Japan during WWII After the fire they live with there father¬ís sister who is not well off and envies the privileges offered to her brother¬ís family. She takes it out on the children. Although well intentioned, Setsuko is not very streetwise and makes many mistakes as any headstrong teenager would taking care of a 4 year old on his own. I watched the first half with my 3&4 year old boys, and figured I would have to turn it off if it got to deep. Luckily before that happened my four year old told me we should read books this is too boring. Probably appropriate for some children 13+ years.",

The story based on a young boy who eventually loses everything and desperately tries to shield the horrors from his little sister (such as the search for their mother) who also dies is so beautifully animated and tastefully written that I found myself struggling to turn away. This story is about the lives of people destroyed and not of grand omniscience, centering on political/military figures, which is probably why hollywood would become unstuck. Whenever i watch this film I cry, at the tender relationship between Seito and Setsuko, the beautiful and apt music, the overwhelming sense of loss.

For one - as an American I have somewhat of a disconnected view on Japanese side of WWII. This is good and bad for the story so it could really go either way depending on the person. \n\nI will say that I wish the film was longer so that they could have exploited the huge theme with fire a little more. I saw the references all throughout but it was just a little vague for me to really pull something from it. \n\nHaving said that - there are reasons to watch this film.

This is a heartbreaker, and it's all the more painful that it's such a beautifully told one. It threatens to take you to emotional places you never wanted to go, and then makes good on its threats. If the ultimate purpose of art is to create catharsis, there really are no other films that do it like this one. The Studio Ghibli animation is absolutely top-notch, and frankly puts a lot of hyperreal American animation to shame. There's a poetry, subtlety, and minimalism in the animation that almost instantly causes a direct emotional response. It's one of the rare times when I honestly can't imaging this story told in any other way. At this point, I feel I still haven't successfully conveyed just how much and how powerfully this film has moved me. If you do plan on seeing it, make sure you're not already in a low mood, as this one puts you through the emotional wringer.

Unlike many other Studio Ghibli films, this movie does not end on a high note. In fact, it leaves you with a depressed feeling that could ruin your day. It's certainly not a movie for the faint of heart or the over emotional. This would be an emotional hazard to the latter two. I still recommend this movie to die hard Studio Ghibli fans. It's a haunting retelling of a WWII situation that was quite realistic, after hearing about my grandparents who were in the bombing of Hiroshima. It's a beautiful film, but I probably won't watch it again for a while.",

It goes back to Hitchcock talking about a bomb being hidden under a desk: We show two people talking while cutting to short shots of the bomb. This builds emotion.\n\nBut, the bomb can't go off. If the bomb goes off there isn't a release - just an explosion. All of that tension stays built up inside of you.\n\nThat's my problem with this movie, no matter how gut-wrenching, sad or even realistic it is, it has a fatal flaw. The audience, in my opinion, is never given a moment to release the tension - just an explosion.\n\nThis movie, following Hitchcock's example, is a series of tension building moments, followed by small, quiet, extremely depressing explosions.\n\nBut, maybe the intent of the movie was to build emotion/tension and not release it. Maybe that was the point.",

This is a beautiful and symbolism-rich emotional force.

It follows a brother and sister who lose everything because of the U.S. bombings on Japan. Right off the bat, we know neither one will make it, but that doesn't put anything in the way of it's emotional pull. The whole world around them is beautiful yet drowning in devastation. No one is willing to go out of their way to help them as they all have their own problems to attend to.

This is the Schindler's List of animation if you can compare, both are heart wrenching stories. Both are also true, the film was based on a man's (I apologize his name escapes me) autobiography of the traumas, horrors and fears as a child during WWII, he wrote it after blaming himself for years he was the one responsible for his infant sisters death, the book was written to ease him, the film is an attempt and a bloody good one to show us what happened.\r\n\r\nAs a companion piece to Totoro this should be viewed first, then Totoro following. Both films take place in Japan in different areas and time frame but both are very close in the frames of time, like I said Grave is during WWII and Totoro is post war Japan, Grave is based around Kobe, Japan while Totoro is in the country side, Grave is a dark color while Totoro is light. Both films work well off each other but one you will go back to first will be Grave\r\n\r\nArtistic liberties will always be taken but what Isao Takahata has given us is a intensely moving work of art.

This blissful masterpiece that generates sequences through experience and memories, it can suprise many with its heartfelt content. Many times, war films will use destruction as a device to capture the crowd but seldomnly, a few others use imagery and expression instead. Takahata is one of the few. He does'nt use special effect bombs or glowing fires to implement destruction but the sight of enemy planes and the sound of the sirens. Its effectiveness is not found in physical damage(much like what the little girl endures) but physcological damage found only in depressing times. \r\n\r\nTakahata(the director & writer) did'nt want the crowd to examine the story nor intend to make it complex. He just wanted us(the audience) to experience what Seita and Setsuko experienced as children in a time where fire was more devastating then it is now. Placed in Kobe, Japan during World War II where american planes will apply air raids across the town to destroy territory and decimate morale. A tactic often used in war. \r\n\r\nThroughout the film, it is slowed down to pace and it makes you witness the fires, the farms, the lake, and the sky. As if it was something important. And indeed it can be as life so easily certain can be destroyed through mans greed and demise. The little things have become more sufficient then it was when fires were used for heating and cooking and not grazing homes. \r\n\r\nSeita is a young teenage boy who takes care of his sister Setsuko while his mother is sick and his father at sea fighting for the cause. A devotion sort of to family values and what must be done for the cause of survival for further generations. There are several scenes where Sieta will carry his sister because she gets tired or hungry. Slowly walking down each road as he paces with his eyes torward the ground thinking of what to do to just stay alive for another day. This experience is not something so rare but something depressingly real. No ones thinking for him and its a one man war. Everyday is a battle for Seita to ensure their(Setsuko and himself) health and prosperity through acceptable theft and pawn trading. Even though he is breaking the law or is often aggresive, nothing can be said to defend his wrong doing. You actually(as a viewer) want him to succeed. He is our hero but most importantly, he is Setsuko's hero. \r\n\r\nThis color coated still painting of anmation is sort of lost in todays world and everything is digital rather then hand drawn. Everything is more alive and 3D rather then artistically drawn to each their own visisble emotion. When Popeye walked with that tough guy personality, its almost to comical to watch but you knew he was going to kill someone with those guns(arms). But there is no Popeye and only Nemo whos representation of cuteness panns the once universally acclaimed animation. Where everything was a work of art and not digitally written. Where it takes days to build up and not one hour. Grave Of The Fireflies(although made in 1988) still holds dear to classic animation through sarcastic visual features and tranquil settings with colors through a swift but patient pace. A perfect execution through art and emotional prowress. \r\n\r\nEven though at times the film can be uneasy to handle(like when Setsuko eats rocks, not visually seen but mentioned), it does it in such a peaceful way where it does'nt disgust the viwer but to carefully place an arch through one's thought process. To make you believe and feel sorrow rather then to visually see it and clench your body. Its raw execution in it itself is what makes this film so memorable. Its not that its to sad or to depressing but it tells us a story and shows us an experience that everynow and then, we can learn from it. \r\n\r\nYes its anime, yes they have big eyes, yes its foriegn, but get over yourself. This is one of the better animated films to ever come out in the past 50 years. Not since the original Micky Mouse had I ever been so entertained and moved by animation. When Roger Ebert said it belonged in the category as one of the best war films, I was appalled as he should've said \"one of the best films of all time\".",

Brother and sister, Seita and Setsuko do their best to find shelter, food and hope. \r\n\r\n      It is rare to find this much humanity in animation. There is so much life in the characters that they take you away. Animation allows for an artistic exploration of events where the creator can tell their tale however they see fit. \r\n    \r\n     As I've mentioned, this is not a happy film but it does have a lovely reminder about the strength of family and hope.

Even film¬ís like Lars Von Trier¬ís Dancer in the Dark (2000) had a glimmer of hope that things would be ok. \r\n\r\nI loved how much an animated feature could make me feel so strongly about something and I understand that the point of this film was how relentless war is, but watching this was just like watching depression-session-misery-torture. \r\n\r\nThere was no way of it ending up with any form of hope, joy or optimism, not that I wanted it to, but I wanted to think that it could. I do not mind something not having a happy-ever-after ending, in fact I¬íd usually complain when things are too happy-happy but I think that the best tear-jerker moments and the ones that have the most impact are those where either unfortunate events, to a certain extent come by surprise, or more specifically that you know there could be something horrible about to happen but you are still not sure and there is still the chance of everything being alright. The shattering of this built up hope leaves you feeling more vulnerable and therefore increases the effectiveness of the narrative.\r\n\r\nBy showing you at this film¬ís opening that the main character dies and joins his little sister in the afterlife, once his mother dies in the opening act you know there really is no way out for the doomed little boy. This does succeed at showing the uncompromising relentless nature of war but it really was tortuous and difficult to watch.
