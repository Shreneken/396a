Set in Geneva, Valentine (Irene Jacob), immersed in both her studies and her modeling career, develops a unique friendship with a retired judge after she accidently runs over his dog.  Beautifully shot in an array of red hues by Piotr Sobocinski and intelligently scripted by Kieslowski and long-time colleague Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Three Colors: Red is the stunning final piece to one of cinema's great trilogies, concluding with the reintroduction of characters from the first two films.",

            "content": "All three films in the \"Three Colours Trilogy\" are must watches, and even me considering 'Three Colours: White' the weakest of the three is not saying anything to discredit it. That is still a great film which is testament to the brilliance of 'Blue' and 'Red' for them to be even better.\n\n'Three Colours: Red' is my favourite of the trilogy. Even with less emphasis on action and dialogue (though not devoid), it has the most layered, thematically rich and thought-provoking story of the trilogy. To me, 'Red' is not just the best film in the trilogy but also one of the best films seen by me in a while and one of the finest final films for any director.\n\nIt chiefly focuses on the electrifying relationship between Valentine and the judge, and like with 'Blue' being a poignant exploration of grief and liberty and 'White' a blackly entertaining one of equality and revenge 'Red' explores the theme of fraternity, as well as other themes of morality, free will and destiny, and manages to tell a powerful and thoughtful story out of those themes. Again, like 'White' and particularly 'Blue', 'Red' is heavy in symbolism, such as the recycling of bottles (here representing solidarity), the use of the colour red to emphasise the theme of fraternity, links to the protagonist's past (here with fountain pens and never shutting doors and gates) and juxtaposition of physical levels, but in a way that's always fascinating and never incomprehensible (even if it takes more than one viewing or some research to fully get the significance of it all).\n\nVisually, while all three films are superbly made, 'Red' is perhaps the most visually stunning. The cinematography is stunning in its elegance and beauty, with bold use of colour and handsome production design. The music score is the most powerful of the three films and the most memorable and fitting, not as symbolic or as intricate as 'Blue' but stirring stuff indeed. Kieslowski's direction as ever is assured and unobtrusive, his style is unmistakable and he does a lot of interesting touches that make the film visually and dramatically fascinating.\n\nAgain, the writing is thought-provoking and makes the most of the film's rich themes. The central relationship is portrayed electrifyingly while the ending is quite the masterstroke in figuratively and literally tying the whole trilogy up. The two lead roles are immaculately acted by luminous Irene Jacob and commandingly nuanced Jean-Louis Trintignant.\n\nIn summary, a brilliant film in every sense. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Unarguably, the magnum opus of Krzysztof Kieslowski\u2019s film catalogue. Still stunned on how Kieslowski managed to connect the entire trilogy at the end of this film. The visuals of the film are flawless with the use of warm colors, especially red hue. This can be seen from the most prominent shot of the movie which is the photograph Valentine took for the chewing gum ad and it\u2019s corresponding frame shown during the rescue of Valentine. The thematic representation (Fraternity) of the film is super extensive. Even The telephone call which is shown at the beginning portray that everyone is connected either intentionally or unintentionally. This is the third film of the three colors trilogy which follows the motto of the France \u2018Freedom, Equality, Fraternity\u2019. This is the only movie other than Fanny and Alexander (1982) which score 100 in both Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. In this film, the director emphasizes on the interconnected lives of different people as a ramification of fate, destiny and chance. Each of the characters in the film is somehow interconnected with or without their knowledge. Even the retired judge, Kern and his alter ego/reincarnation, Auguste. Throughout the film, most captivating performance is from Kern and Valentine. Kern tries to play \u2018god\u2019 but redeems due to the compassion and kindness of Valentine. The main theme of the film \u2018fraternity/connection\u2019 is further implemented at the end when both neighbors, Valentine and Auguste meet each other for the first time after their ferry got capsized (unintentional connections). Even more fascinating is that Auguste (also a judge) was overseeing the class-action lawsuit filed against Kern by his neighbors due to spying. Valentine, Kern, Auguste, his lover Karin, and the protagonists of the preceding two films were brought together through destiny and fate. Even more, Valentine, Kern and Auguste were also interrelated by chance. ",

With a narrative that combines the satisfactory conclusion of an Ocean's Eleven-esque reveal and an emotionally resonant and philosophical base with cinematography orchestrated to match the sophistication and harmony of a Swiss watch, Three Colors: Red is functional on both a surface level and as a piece of serious filmmaking. The Marvel Cinematic Universe of arthouse cinema concludes with that same energy of, \"Hey, it's all connected. You're that woman from that other thing!\" without feeling as if it were supposedly pandering or forced, though you do have to wonder with the edning of White how Karol and Dominique end up on the same vessel crossing the Channel. The carefully constructed perspective of the camera and the relative positions between characters brings to mind the work of Yasujiro Ozu and his innovative takes on angle and perspective, here realized in the depiction of character, particularly in the relationship between Jacob's Valentine and Trintignant's Kern. The color and imagery are each carefully controlled to add to the narrative. As compelling a film as has been made in the past half century. (5/5)",

            "content": "This was the best film in the Three Colors trilogy, it managed to incorporate the serious melodrama of Blue and the delicate balance of humor and darkness in White to produce a romantic film in which the two leads do not interact until the final moments of the film. Mysticism and the idea that two people were \u00e2~meant' to meet was a theme in all three films but here this idea is delved into the most and we even get a figure who resembles a Delphic Oracle. I had only seen Irene Jacob in U.S. Marshals (1998) and I was not aware of her abilities as a dramatic actress but here the entire cast is magnificent as weird, delightful people who don't feel as though they would usually be characters in a romantic film but combine to form an interesting study of relationships and the nature of intimacy.\n\nValentine, Irene Jacob, works as a model, is a ballet student and appears to be pursuing higher education but her life seems empty as she is only seen contacting her boyfriend, Michel, over the phone. One day she hits a dog and discovers that the dog's owner, Joseph, Jean-Louis Trintignant, spies on his neighbors by listening to their private telephone conversations. Although Valentine is initially morally outraged she adjusts her outlook on life as he teaches her about his personal moral philosophy. Concurrently we see a young judge Auguste, Jean-Pierre Lorit, whose experiences echo those of Joseph as a young man. It is understood that there is a connection between the two young, slightly lost people and Kern's belief that she will end up happy with a man appears to be true as the two finally meet at the end of the film.\n\nMy mother's initial problem with the film was that Valentine was not very clearly defined as a character and that the fact that she was a model and a ballet student made her appear both shallow and as though she was a male fantasy. I believe that she was developed as a character as I believe we see that there is something missing from her life at the beginning of the film and although she tries to fill that hole with many things only love will be able to make her truly happy. Her modeling is also an important element of her character because we see that she does not just put on costumes and pretend in her job but in her personal life. She is a compelling lead and her strength is not shown through loud, screechy monologues or her physically abusing a man but through her forthrightness in her interactions with those around her.\n\nThe romantic elements of the film are handled with care as Kieslowski is careful to never let the film slip into being sappy or sentimental because that's simply not his style. Joseph's philosophy is harsh and often confrontational but it is clear that his conviction that Valentine will find lasting love. Pain and heartbreak are not seen as something to be erased from the human experience, they are seen as essential elements of finding love. Without heartbreak how can we properly relish the feeling of being in love, the difficulty of continuing a relationship despite impediments and the importance of getting back up again after having been knocked down. The uniting of our two lovelorn leads is such an ecstatic moment because these two have faced immense pains in their love lives leading up to this moment and we, the audience, are so desperate to see them find the person who won't break their heart or neglect them.\n\nThe film can be watched and understood by anybody, even myself who has never been in a romantic relationship, because we have all witnessed love and heartbreak. They are universal emotions and Kieslowski brings them to life in a film that feels oddly like the mix of a fairytale and the preamble to a Werner Herzog documentary. Loving this film has caused me to be labeled a \u00e2~ pretentious hipster' by my friends but I really don't care because this is a great film that deserves to be loved by more than just film critics and cineastes.",

I was totally enthralled by the stories that were told throughout the film, and I couldn\u2019t wait to see how the disparate lives would come together by the end. The ending was a bit less satisfying than I had hoped, but it had a lot of expectations built on that moment because I wanted both a proper conclusion to this film and a conclusion to the entire trilogy of Three Colors films. However, the fact that I was waiting breathless for that reveal shows how engaged I was in the story of Red. It\u2019s not a complex story, but the characters have complexity that made it a deeper film experience. Even now I can\u2019t recall a lot of the specific details of what happened in the movie, but I can recall how moments between the characters felt and the stunning visuals.

If the previous ones depicted the ideologies of the aftermath of catastrophic events and a subjective procedure of how to survive them, this one at least grabs your attention with a lighter perspective. Nevertheless, the gist remains the same, the method is more subtle and complex than the previous ones. This one is made to make you sweat on your seat. It demands you to be on the edge of your seat. It is a tale that makes you think. The argumentative conversation, morally complex situation and ethically challenged solutions, this one is much more talkative and yet is still inexpressive than any of its chapter.\n\nIt is way too layered and mature than we usually get. This final death sentence of the trilogy, is a remarkable revelations on terms of storytelling. Kieslowski has much more Shakespeare in him than it comes off. He takes those same emotion and impute them at different situations and different characters, and projects the range and parallel nature of that single emotion. The narrative is adaptive and layered with sharp conversations that amps up the charge to a whole new level. There is more ruggedness in here, despite of it not being that sinister and dark than its previous chapters.\n\nIt stands alone in the entire trilogy. This one is brighter and sweeter, it doesn't demand attention, it just keeps pulling you back in with its unstoppable force. Trintignant is a threat on screen, he can be mean as a street but his nurturing is quite mellow. His ideologies are off track and yet sane than most of the characters. But personally, I prefer, Jacob's simpler and honest character. The innocence of hers that is latter filtered by the outer perspective, is just one of the best bits of the feature.

            "content": "And so, we reach the highly, highly, highly awaited (Please, let this be over, so I can get some sleep) conclusion to Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's \"American Flag\" trilogy... right? You'll have to forgive my being an ignorant American and not noticing the distinctions between the color patterns of the French and American flags. Well, one has to at least give it to me that I recognize the distinctions in the two country's forms of patriotism, because where American patriotism leads to the booze, baseball and football, French patriotism leads to something that is somehow less interesting to me, a movie buff. Well, this installment is more grounded than ever, but the point is that Kie\u015blowski has finally completed this rather tedious showcase of his French patriotism... as a Pole, and just in time, because not two years after this film came out, he went the way of the French Revolutionaries who died to uphold the ideals that Kie\u015blowski evidently subscribed to. If you want to keep up this talk of patriotism and make more reference to what the colors on the French flag represent, I suppose you could say that Kie\u015blowski was given liberty... then equality, and then death, although the red on the French flag doesn't represent death. That should probably be stressed, because this film is likely the closest that annoyingly pretentious film school snobs are going to get to fraternity in college. Actually, I don't know how pretentious this film is, because, like I said, it's the most grounded of the \"Three Colors\" trilogy, and is decent because of it, although it's not completely above misguidance.\r\n\r\n\"Blue\" was a prime example of what I like to refer to as \"La Villa Strangiato\", - in honor of the Rush instrumental which took the subtitle \"An Exercise in Self-Indulgence\" - in that it was one of art films which meditated upon just about nothing, and while \"White\" was a much a tighter and more grounded film, it was still misguided, and here, if there is overt lyricism to abstract storytelling, it's rare enough for you to not notice, which isn't to say that this film doesn't still have a tendency to drag its feet, with repetitious, if not aimless filler which squanders time that could have been dedicated more towards characterization. Immediate background development is lacking, and gradual exposition is adequate enough for you to get to know these characters just fine, but considering that this film is so much more grounded than its overtly naturalist predecessors, there's no excuse for its neglecting, if not the sudden abandonment of potentially intriguing conflicts and themes which stand away from the film's central focus, yet would add to the depth of a story that, quite frankly, needs more meat. Despite not quite having the scope of \"White\", this film's story concept certainly has a whole lot more depth to it than the overly intimate \"Blue\" and the lighthearted \"White\", but it's still a minimalist premise that establishes only so much bite and consequence, but plenty of conventions. Even though \"Blue\" and \"White\" had the audacity to be formulaic in its attempts at being artistically offbeat, one has to figure that this film, with its being more grounded than ever, is more formulaic than ever, and sure enough, the film is predictable, as surely as it is overlong, meandering along a familiar path at what at least feels like a glacial clip. I've rambled on and on about how this film is made much more interesting than its predecessors by its all but abandoning roots of abstract lyricism, but don't go in with the hopes that dryness is abandoned, because there's still something rather subdued about Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's direction, which relies on quietness, if not an ethereal atmosphere over all of meditations that, while not abstract, seriously bland things up, if not dull them down. I did find myself uncovering some not-so fond memories of boredom from the arguably tedious predecessors, and although I was generally engaged, potential, no matter limited, is lost in the wake of some misguided ambitions, if not laziness. The final product runs the risk of succumbing to the mediocrity its predecessors decidedly fell to, but it achieve decency, against all expectations, and gets there partly because it remains about as aesthetically solid as its predecessors.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, this series has stood as a testament to the brilliant musical abilities of Zbigniew Preisner, whose score for \"Blue\" was masterful in its genuine classicalism, and whose much less sweeping score for \"White\" was still charming and lovely in its lightness, and although this film is still awfully quiet, it's as celebratory of Preisner's gifts as any installment, ranging from a haunting sobriety to a captivating grandness that is rare in modern classical music, let alone modern film scoring. The musical style is certainly there, and when it comes to the visual style, well, it's not too much more explored by this mostly quiet affair, arguably being the least handsome of the three films, but decidedly being handsome by its own right, regardless, with Piotr Soboci\u0144ski delivering on cinematography that was, for 1994, crisp in its emphasis on spare lighting in order to tastefully compliment the heart of this human drama's tone, if not certain colors, such as - you guessed it - red. Even the visual style seems to be eager to explore the depths of this film in an artistically subtle manner, and one can understand the ambition, that is, to a certain extent, for although this story is too intimate to carry all that much dynamicity or consequence, it's still a tasteful portrait on humanity and love, and it is done justice by a script by Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski and Piesiewicz which, for all its excesses and thinness, is more focused in its exploration of worthy themes and worthy characters. It still stands to be juicier, but the characterization of this film still manages to draw rich and relatable roles who go brought to life by a cast that has little material, but plenty of charisma, whether it be the lovely Ir\u00e8ne Jacob, or the subtly piercing Jean-Louis Trintignant. Really, outside of the grand aesthetic aspects, where the flaws of this film stand firm, the strengths are rather subtle, but they are plentiful, and in order to save the film, if not deliver on some resonance, they need to be well-orchestrated by a director who has had a history for getting carried away with subtleties. Well, sure enough, Kie\u015blowski, as director, cannot completely justify his thoughtful approach to everything, for material to draw upon is limited, and yet, whether it be because he's more realized in his thoughtfulness, or simply because he has more material to work with, Kie\u015blowski proves effective more often than not, whether that be aesthetically speaking, or dramatically speaking, with heights in dramatic realization that range from tasteful to near-powerful. The film is still far from rewarding, and is not even what it could have been as a minimalist drama, but it has its moments, and enough of them to engage much more than either of its predecessors, and therefore stand as a decent, if still somewhat questionable art drama.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the film drags its feet quite a bit to say only so much about its characters, and to have only so much meat to a story concept whose familiarity and blandly, if not dully subdued approach bring momentum to a crawl, but don't bring the final product to the mediocrity that claimed its predecessors, for there is enough magnificence to Zbigniew Preisner's score, handsomeness to Piotr Soboci\u0144ski's cinematography, focus to Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's and Piesiewicz's script, grace to Ir\u00e8ne Jacob's and Jean-Louis Trintignant's acting, and realized thoughtfulness to Kie\u015blowski's direction to make \"Three Colors: Red\" an unsurprisingly improvable, yet surprisingly fair conclusion to Kie\u015blowski's otherwise flat trilogy.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

If I compare Red to the other films in the trilogy, I would have to say that the film is between White and Blue. I was expecting the film to match the intensity and weight of Blue but the film just couldn't reach it, and maybe this might due to Red's complication not centred on its protagonist, instead it's found on the mysterious man she encounters. This wouldn't be too much of an issue if the film didn't place all of its focus on Valentine and instead shared it between the two characters then it would give the audience an opportunity to gain a better understanding. Then again, I have only seen the film once and sometimes I tend to learn and develop my own unique take on characters during my subsequent returns.\n\nFrom what I could take in during my watch, I felt that the film was trying to explore ideas of privacy and to an extent, fate. The conversations between the two lead characters revolve around the morality of surveillance, whether it\u00e2??s for private or public use. Joseph Kern initially argues that his obsession of observing other people is due to his desire to understand people and to judge them accurately based on their life, as his old days of being as a judge, he felt that his judgement on the accused was not appropriate as he cannot fully assess the person's lifestyle and values in an unbiased way, a person will always project himself to others the way they expect him or her to be. But as the film progresses, we start seeing shades of the character and therefore our antagonistic view of the character starts to fade, and eventually feeling sympathetic for the man.

The ending alone should establish that idea, but I wasn't able to fully grasp it, as I was too pre-occupied with understanding and connecting with the characters. There is a particular scene I want to bring up, and that is the scene in the theatre and both Valentine and Joseph are discussing about a topic that was avoided previously. This scene was amazing and so effective, there was so much that I felt and learned during that narrow amount of time, and it cleverly sets up for the ending that would want you to go back and rewatch the whole thing.\n\nI am not going to go into the cinematography or the score on this one as I wasn't able to really give myself room to perform an analysis on these elements, but I can definitely say I was satisfied with the way it was handled and provided wonderful uses of the camera that wasn't present during the first two films.\n\nThe acting in this film was great, boasting impressive performances from both Irene Jacobs and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Their chemistry was strong but precisely handled by the director, making sure that their relationship is appropriate in emphasising the ideas and themes of the film and not falling off the track, ensuring it doesn't go cross the line of romantic and melodramatic. It does sadden for me to say that both actors are not as great when they are playing a scene alone, though this is not to say they are a disappointment or average even, but it was underwhelming.\n\nRed was a wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.

Painted with distinct strokes, this film is clearly guided by the hand of an inspired artist. It is totally unpredictable, which is part of what makes it so absorbing. But it doesn't resort to cheap tricks to keep its audience engaged. This is a piece that relies on strong storytelling and performances. More than just a masterpiece, this movie is a fundamental classic of all time!",

There is some amazing tricks done throughout the film, even right of the bat the film grabs you by the throat, and eyes in this case. Sometimes films lose the point of their existence, their lesson, but Red really basks in it and never forgets what it is trying to say.

The trilogy deals with modern day issues concerns the French society.\nValentine (Irene Jacob) is a beautiful Model living in Geneva who has a very complicated relationship with her boyfriend who lives in England and she barely sees him. She ran over a dog by accident, she takes it to its owner who happens to be retired judge, he doesn't seem to care for his dog and he treats Valentine rudely. Later she comes back to visit the judge, he treats differently and he seems more hospitable this time, she discovers that he is spying on his neighbors telephone calls, a man cheating on his wife, a girl who have a relationship with a guy called August (who lives across the street to Valentine) and other neighbors. Valentine develops a very strange and unique friendship with the judge and both share one of the most interesting conversations shown in Motion Pictures.\nThe movie starts with a very beautiful scene; the camera tracks a telephone call through the telephone wire across the streets, tunnels and the ocean. We are all connected but by what? \"Blue\" the first chapter of the trilogy was about Liberty, is Julia free to cut all her ties to the past: her friends, her family, her house and her memories and starts all over as a new person.\"White\" was about Equality, a man's obsession of becoming equal to his ex-wife. And finally \"Red\" is about Fertility, there is an interesting scene when Valentine is making a phone call and the phone rings across the streets in Augusts' Apartment, she is calling her boyfriend not him. There are many times when Valentine crosses paths with August but they never notice each other.     \nThe judge is the most interesting and debating character in the movie, he watches his neighbors and listens to their phone calls in a god-like manner, but does he listens only? Or does he manipulate and paves the way? It is strange how the story he tells Valentine about his past matches the current life of August. There are seven stones but only six windows are broken! There are seven Survivors only six of them we know.\n\"Red\" is the conclusion and the strongest piece of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy and the last movie directed by Kieslowski who died two years later. You can feel like the trilogy is his life statement no surprisingly its one of the greatest achievement in the history of cinema.",

After the pathos and black comedy of White, this was a return to the tone of Blue, this is a moving drama about fate and chance, and how it shapes our lives and makes who we are. University student and part time model Valentine Dusot (Irene Jacob), accidentally runs over a dog while driving back from a photo shoot, she tracks down the dog's owner to Judge Joseph Kern (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who lives a sort of solitary existance, and he doesn't seem bothered about what's happened to the dog, or the fact that it's pregnant either. Valentine finds out Joseph has been eavesdropping on his neighbours' private telephone conversations. She threatens to expose Joseph, but then finds one conversation between her neighbour Auguste Bruner (Jean-Pierre Lorit). But Joseph seems to be obsessed with Auguste's girlfriend Karin (Frederique Feder), with whom, he's involved in a case with. It's a moving and ultimately tragic tale of coincidence and connections, and that it's a small world indeed. Kie\u00c5>lowski keeps the film going nicely and it's the best shot of the 3, and it has one moment that connects all 3 films together. But, it's a fine end to Kie\u00c5>lowski's French trilogy, moving and deep.",
