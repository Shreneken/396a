    "summary": "In the years before World War II, zany heiress Amanda Kelly (Cybill Shepherd) travels by train to Switzerland. While passing through Germany, she meets a sweet elderly lady, Miss Froy (Angela Lansbury), who suddenly vanishes. Distraught, Amanda questions her fellow passengers who claim that the woman was never there. Unsure if it's all in her mind or if there's a more sinister plot afoot, Amanda teams up with photographer Robert Condon (Elliott Gould) to discover the truth.",

            "content": "Quite possibly the most inexplicable Hitchcock remake outside of Gus Van Sant's 'Psycho' (and, I will assume, the remake of The Birds that might someday see the light of day).  The film returns more to the original novel than Hitchcock's film, and that's not exactly a good thing.  Iris becomes a spoiled American heiress going back to London to marry her fourth husband, and is played with shrieking abrasiveness by Cybill Shepard.  Gilbert Redman, the musician of the original film, becomes Robert Condon, a newspaper photographer, played by Elliott Gould.  He is probably the only interesting piece of casting in the whole work and carries off the role with suitable insouciance and charm.  It is a thankless role, however, as he must wrestle with Shepard, fight the Nazis, and deal with collaborators (including a horrifically underused Herbert Lom).  The film doesn't really hang together, even without knowing that it's a remake, and eliminates most of the light-hearted tone mixed with distressing awareness of the world situation that the original, made just before WWII, utilizes so well.  A heavy-handed Hammer production that proves what a great director Hitch truly was.",

This is almost a word for word, scene for scene remake and it all works well except for Cybil Shepherd - yikes! She was awful! She detracts from the film so much! But its all in good fun and this is a light film so you can ignore her faults as an actress to a degree, particularly considering the rest of the cast do a great job. Not a touch on the original but thoroughly enjoyable. Worth a look for fans.",

Cybil Shepard, Angela Landsbury - with them, it couldn't be that bad, right?  Plus I thought it was originally a Hitchcock film, so another great, right??  WRONG.  It was over acted - almost like a stage production.  Then the ending was... wait, there was no ending.  No REAL resolution.  It JUST ended... and pissed me off!  What did the nanny know that put her in jeopardy?  Why was she sent to sing that tune?  What did the tune mean?  What happened to the nun?  Why did the two old guys (one of whom had been shot) simply depart at the end?  Wait, what's with the flood?  The movie left me with more questions than answers.  I was VERY disappointed!",
