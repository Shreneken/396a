All fights are as it should be when performed from a highly trained killer, no half hour punch throwing when you have a knife .. don't use the knife if you have a gun.\nSure, some action fan viewers may say \"If I want to see an action movie, I want to see as much fights as can deliver.\" I agree, but that does not mean that a guy should punch and kick another guy for half hour when he can just cut his throat with a knife in 3 seconds. Not in this movie. Here all fights are fast, clean and effective.",

Korean cinema has always impressed me, and rivals even Bollywood films that try their best (that conveniently made a poor knock-off version of this film). There needs to be a Korean Bollywood category for such iconic films; perhaps Koreallywood? It's an action movie with a heartwarming story, and it's a near perfect film. What's even more impressive, is that this was the second-only writing and directing credit for newb Korean filmmaker Jeong-beom Lee. Lee needs to be teaching film schools in Hollywood, because this is how a film should be made. This shames most Hollywood action films by seasoned filmmakers. The pacing is perfect, so the 2 hour runtime flies by. Every scene is perfectly captured with excellent cinematography. There's a perfect balance of the excellent choreographed action scenes, and the narratives that unfold along the way. Even the score and soundtrack were on point. All casting and performances were spot-on, and Lee was phenomenal in directing his cast, even the young ones. This film was recommended to me by another prolific IMDb reviewer in his 100 must-see films of all time. An excellent recommendation that I agree with. Newb filmmaker Lee is a genius, and this gem is a perfect 10/10 from me.",

            "content": "The Man from Nowhere (2010) - [Jeong-beom Lee]\n\nI have been saying for a while now that the South-Korean Film industry is on a serious upwards trajectory. They are making many really cool films, and not just with Martial Arts movies. That being said I mainly have been watching their Action and Horror releases.\n\nThe Man from Nowhere is a typical Korean action film. They are a few decades behind Hollywood, and this is a good thing. They do not try to reinvent the wheel. Hollywood is so focused on \"subverting expectations\" that they seem to forget that media entrainment, for better or for worse, has already been distilled into stories and arcs that just work. Now sure some legend can break all the rules and make a fantastic film, but most people are not legends. Sticking to the guide lines can produce films that are enjoyable and comfortable for viewers. This is one such action film.\n\nIt is a well trodden action film path. The story is about a organ harvesting operation (this is the third film about gangsters killing people and stealing organs I have seen from Korea.. is this like a issue over there?). There is this mute, strange guy living in a flat.. minding his own business who befriends a mother and her child. Mother killed, child kidnapped... cue bone crunching, bullet spraying blood soaked rampage.\n\nThis is a pretty fun film, even though it is not very original and suffers from \"foreign film aesthetics\". What I mean by that is that after decades of watching US and US influenced cinema we are used to how they tell stories. Many Asian films (among other countries) simply do not follow those rules. This can make strange tonal shifts, make them hard to understand or a number of other things that can put off a western viewer.\n\nBut, even with that in mind, I still think this is a solid action film and well worth a look see. I think it is so good in fact, that I would be astounded if Hollywood is NOT trying to get a US Remake off the ground. Mr Nobody and John Wick are basically the same kind of film as this. If you like action films about a reluctant badass that takes out a small army of scum bag gangsters... then this one is worth adding to the pile.\n\nVerdict : 'Cause you know every quiet recluse is a x-military, special op assassin, ninja policeman who has had his wife and children murdered in a brutal and ptsd inducing way.",

Instead of an action-packed thrill ride like many of its peers this film has only a couple of fight scenes, preferring instead to dwell on the menace arising from the main character's inability to act in the face of depravity. The sparse action scenes are choppily constructed, making them hard to follow and exchange enjoyment of form for expression of tone. Still, it's coherent and well-told overall, so if you have no content aversion you may enjoy the meager, eventual catharsis.\n\nContent warning: child abuse, organ trafficking\n\nClosest comparison: It's like You Were Never Really Here by way of Oldboy.\n\nSetting: Crime\nPlot: Action\nTone: Horrific Tragedy",

But it is not about the theme, or even the plot, it is about the Visual Opera that unfolds before your eyes. The man from nowhere gets his noble roots from Samurai movies, Middle Age tales, or even Chinese WuXia. This Drama even symbolizes its Chevaleresque inspiration with a Knight Magic card given by the little girl to ask for protection.

All that soaked in buckets of enjoyable gore. Also, Won Bin gives a strong act as a grizzled and dark character. Overall, in terms of Korean films, this is one of the best movies I've seen in some time in that movie category. And for action fans, The Man from Nowhere is a must see. Recommended!!",

The cinematography here was surprisingly great, some really pleasing shots here. The music was pretty fitting, but used too much and not very subtly or creatively. The pacing stumbled a bit too.\n\nThe action, oh man, the action was insanely good. So fucking visceral and gritty, choreographed really well. The knife action was intense. Probably the best knife fighting I've ever seen.\n\nNow the story starts out pretty simple, but gets a whole lot darker than I expected. Which is dumb of me to say, because I should know by now that Koreans aren't afraid to explore some really fucked up things in our world. The plot mostly makes sense, but some of the motivations are shown in a bit of a clumsy and blunt way. A bit more subtlety would probably work better.\n\nUltimately, it's a very satisfying movie that keeps you interesting, and makes up for it's shortcomings with a whole lot of passion. It left me with a good taste in my mouth, I didn't feel like the film was marred by it's somewhat clumsy execution at times. Another great Korean movie.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the morbidly hilarious villains. Such over the top pure evil. One of them reminded me a lot of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.

The Director: Jeong-beom Lee, beautifully crafted each scene with quick cut scenes and raw camera angles that made you feel part of the story.  Bin Won or Won Bin who played Cha Tae-sik (The main hero/character) was so brilliant that you cant help but wonder about his past.  His calm demeanor  throughout the movie left a feeling of anxsiousness  waiting for his special forces moves to break out.

The performances are moving and utterly convincing. The fight scenes are vivid and new, a pleasure to repeat-watch in detail - I always notice something new. \n\nThe characters - whether good, bad, or ugly, or all of the above - are well-drawn, and the actors throw themselves into the roles with abandon. (The villains are particularly fun, and one, Hee-won Kim, seems to be making a fine career of it.)\n\nThe protagonist is a mysterious loner who seems to haunt his life like a ghost. The little neighbor girl is pulling him back down to earth, getting on his nerves and then getting under his skin. The child actor, Sae-ron Kim, is a natural talent who does a brilliant balancing act, making So-mi insistent, yet irresistible. Bin Won in the lead is a revelation - haunting, fierce, tender, as Tae-sik resists the agony of being recalled to life.\n\n(Check out his other roles and see how completely he transforms from one to another. Takes my breath away!)\n\nThe acting is a treat - I re-watch scenes without the words, just to see how powerfully the actors do their jobs with the other tools at their disposal.

Actors like Denzel Washington and Jean Reno didn't go through circles on their rampage that dealt greatly in their tragic characters, but this film takes us through all the feels, and doesn't let us forget the cold and dark world it portrays. Director Jeong-beom Lee (Cruel Winter Blues) makes great strides with subtle action scenes that are still wonky, BUT SO FUCKING FUN!

The visual style in this Korean thriller is top-notch and truly elevates the film while a few lighthearted filmmaking moments provide enough comedic relief to add fun to what is otherwise a dreary premise - from the brilliant execution of our protagonist jumping out a window and landing in seemingly one shot, to the deft action and fight scenes that unravel in a no-bullshit manner, and to instances of very appreciable dialogue (most by our main villain) during moments where viewers are probably thinking the same thing (one example occurring during a car ride in which the villain is on the phone with our protagonist and calls out the moments of silences and the eventual hang-up - a fun strategy by director Lee Jeong-beom to diffuse overly dramatic tendencies). Won Bin is electrifying in his role - his performance is muted but painful while aided by sharp costume design that increases the presence (and coolness) of his character. It has its flaws and head-scratching moments, but overall, this film is a strong addition to South Korea's growing list of powerful and riveting revenge crime thrillers.",

This is an action movie where the \"hero\" acts out of desperation and devotion to another person. It's an action movie that holds its main character to a high regard, not just because he's a good fighter but also because he is the only character in this world with the ability to put the life of another person above his own.\n\nThis is an action movie that lives in a realm of cinema far beyond the same old Hollywood schlock we get every year in America. It's a movie that sets up a central character that you actually hold in high regard as a human being. He isn't a simple-minded ex-marine or ex-cop who can't control himself. He's the kind of action hero we need to have in American cinema, one with morals.\n\nAlso, I'd be lying if I said that this film didn't have spectacularly directed action.\n\nIt's a masterpiece of Korean action cinema that is fluidly directed, exceedingly well acted, beautifully written, and very exciting.\n\nI couldn't have possibly loved this movie more! I hope tired franchises like \"Taken\" and \"The Expendables\" are taking notes.",

            "content": "The South Korean cinema has turned movies centered around the theme of vengeance into a macabre, unique art form, from Park Chan-wook's thematically diverse The Vengeance Trilogy, to Kim Ji-woon's bleak, hyperviolent I Saw the Devil (2010); The Man from Nowhere falls somewhere in between these movies. Pawnshop owner Cha Tae-sik lives a sombre, linear life, and finds comfort in an uncanny friendship with So-mi (Kim Sae-ron) and a cactus plant. Seen by those in his apartment complex as a possible gangster and a sex criminal, Tae-sik's life is simple until So-mi's mother becomes entangled with an illegal operation between two South Korean gangs, where one of them eventually coming after both So-mi and her mother, which Tae-sik is inadvertently dragged into.\n\nThe Man from Nowhere is one of those movies where the antagonists gradually realize that they've just ****ed with the wrong guy... and continue ****ing with the wrong guy. By no means is Won Bin at Iko Uwais or Donnie Yen's level, but when it comes down to it, he is able to unleash a flurry of punches and kicks to the vital points of his enemies as the mysterious Cha Tae-sik, who rarely smiles or says anything beyond three lines at any given time, which seems to be the biggest downfall of the character, but that really isn't saying much considering the other characters are ostensibly written worse than Tae-sik and are all nothing more than forgettable villainous caricatures of South Korean cinema.\n\nWhile it is a slow-burn action movie that takes its own sweet time teasing the viewer before going for the jugular in the final act, director Lee Jeong-beom proves that he knows how to craft an action flick as watching The Man from Nowhere makes one thing blatantly clear; other similar movies released after it have clearly taken cues from this movie and expanded on them. The Man from Nowhere's premise is similar to The Equalizer's (2014), and it has a scene that is nearly identical to Denzel Washington's first fight scene in the movie, though ironically The Equalizer didn't adapt this movie's wide shots during the close-quarter sequences, instead opting for klutzy torso hugging camerawork. Additionally, The Man from Nowhere features a kerambit-wielding antagonist similar to The Raid 2: Berandal (2014), both in appearance and utility, and it even features a fight scene similar to Berandal's kitchen scene, though Gareth Evans took his version of it to a much more elaborate and visually brutal degree.",

The film isn't original, with two-dimensional criminals and there is a fake-out at the end that seems unnecessary.

While the acting tends to venture on the silly side from some of the supporting cast, the main actor isn't asked to stray much with his emotions as the hardened ex-military-cop-turned-pawn-shop-owner.  There are some good hand-to-hand combat scenes with a little more gunplay than the former, but when it comes to gangster flicks from the East, it's pretty solid.  With plenty of revenge to fuel the film, outside it's brief slowdown about an hour in and an unclear bad guy from the first act, it settles in nicely with emotion and grit for any art house adventure flick.",
