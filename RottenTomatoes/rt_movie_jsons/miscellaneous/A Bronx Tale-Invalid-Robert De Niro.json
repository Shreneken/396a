I found it a little far-fetched that Jane chose to get back with C after he used the N-word in that context with arguing with her brother but I can still see why she chose to give him another chance for telling the truth and protecting her brother. It was also a very pleasant surprise to see the best of the best himself (Joe Pesci) show up in the film toward the end, and I wish he was in it more. Other than that this film is practically flawless and I give it a lot of credit for how it made me feel. Very shocking course of events!",

The conflict between the working man father and gangster second father makes explicit the tension and temptations facing a young man growing up during that time. In this adaptation, that conflict takes a front seat, and it is very well executed. \n\nHowever, the other side of the story, the romance with Jane and difficulties of an interracial couple, seem to take a back seat. It's not necessarily deficient in and of itself, but it is not an emphasis in the movie. As an example, C and Jane resolve their fight almost immediately, despite him saying things that warrant a litter longer for forgiveness. It was still a great movie, but for this reason it doesn't deserve 5 stars from me.",

For a directorial debut, Robert DeNiro, who also starred, did quite a good job. \nWhat I found particularly interesting about this movie is that it doesn't concentrate so much on the crime and violence itself, which is the focus of many of these genre flicks. But rather on the relationship between the characters. It's a movie that tackles themes of fatherhood, success, and doing what's right. \nAnd it's supported by a great and authentic cast, with of course Robert DeNiro, Chazz Palminteri and Lillo Brancato Jr. The score is also quite innovative. \nAnd the film's ending is quite powerful, this is a film with a certain emotion. \nOverall, I loved this movie, it's a classic. Great flick and recommended !!",

A story about the mafia in 1960s New York... with a nice helping of brutal violence from time to time.  \n\nAnd it occurred to me that people just at once decided to almost entirely stop making gangster movies after The Sopranos ended.  It's like Westerns now, you only get like one a year.  The Dark Knight.... Killing Them Softly... A Most Violent Year....... Boardwalk Empire might as well have been a farewell to the gangster genre since nobody wants to make those movies anymore.  Such a shame.  Green Book actually is the closest thing to a movie that reminded me of the kinds of awesome characters in gangster movies with Viggo Mortensen's performance.  I kept thinking if they made that movie in the 90s that'd be De Niro in that role.\n\nBut this came out right when gangster movies were big in the 90s and it's perfect.\n\nThis movie falls into that category of coming of age dramas where you have stories about adults told through the eyes of a child... the child grows up but still.  This kid who idolizes gangsters and Sonny played by Chazz Palminteri.  All he sees is the coolness, the suits, the cars, the jokes.... he has no idea a guy like Sonny destroys lives everyday, probably making money dealing drugs in the city, etc.\n\nChazz is tremendous in this movie, he's one of my favorite actors with stuff like The Usual Suspects and Bullets Over Broadway and he should have been up for an Oscar for playing Sonny in this.  Much like Heat, this movie was mysteriously snubbed for any and all Oscar nominations. \n\nAnyway Chazz plays Sonny in a way that makes him charming, wise but also frightening.  Doesn't matter what jokes he tells or what advice he gives or if he's a rare gangster who's not racist... he's still a killer who will launch into violence without a moment's hesitation.\n\nSuch as in the best scene of the movie when Sonny's guys have to... deal... with some bikers who come into their bar and try to start some shit... yeah those wish they just got a case of beer and went into one of their rec rooms after that afternoon.  It's the Italian gangster story all over, they fought their way to get their place in New York you better believe they're gonna fight to keep it.\n\nDe Niro does double duty directing the movie and playing C's working class father.  Watching this movie I almost did a double take a couple times.... because it's happened now and again but it's SO rare to see De Niro playing a totally normal, nice, good person.  I kept waiting to see a dark side or something and no, he's just a good guy.  The poster's a little misleading, might make you think the movie is about a confrontation between C's dad and Sonny and it's not.  It's more unspoken and metaphorical with C being caught between these 2 father figures and not knowing which one he respects more until the end.\n\nThis is right smack in De Niro's streak of killer performances and it's one of my favorite's of his.  I saw shades of my own dad in his performance.\n\nHeavy as the story may be, like so many Italian gangster movies it's hysterically funny.  Again, this is why it pisses me off that they stopped making movies like this because De Niro just had an unlimited access to guys from the neighborhood where some of them are actors and some of them are clearly the real thing but everyone in the movie is a character with more charisma than 90% of actors you see in movies and TV today.  That's one of the things that made The Wire so good, like in this movie you'll have a character off screen just yell some random shit that's the funniest thing in the scene.\n\nLike the funniest scene in the movie this dice game.  Where Sonny keeps feeling jinxed and keeps ordering his guys to shove guys he doesn't like the look of in the bathroom.\n\n\"Put him in the bathroom!\"  Jesus that's a funny scene.\n\nDe Niro did one hell of a job putting this movie together.  I guess he was taking notes from Scorsese all those years.\n\nA Bronx Tale is a movie about violence, family and the difference between respect and fear.  And it's a perfect movie.",

The picture and setting was good and the cast that the movie has are great because they fit for a good mobster movie. The movie also showed a little racism going on during the setting of the film to show the audience how the Italian perspective of racism.I enjoyed the movie but there were a couple of things that kind of bothered me that are in a lot of 90's movies. The unlimited or extended bullets on a gun and what I mean by that is the main boss would have a revolver and some how and some way, he would be able to shoot 15 to 20 bullets before reloading. Another thing was the acting of someone getting shot or tortured. I think some of the acting of those particular parts were a little too much meaning they over did it on the acting which is a common thing for 90's movies. I consider the movie to be great because the plot was good, the cast was great, it showed how normal lives were back then, and it showed some comedy to the audience.",

They all live in a well-established depiction of The Bronx that is complete with a well-executed soundtrack. Lastly, they all play a part in telling a story that proudly walks the fine line between Comedy and Drama.\nBefore seeing this picture, I was afraid that it was going to be De Niro taking a stab at being a poor man's Martin Scorsese, but instead he has created a film that stands on its own two feet because it is marked by a unique identity that makes it stand out from countless other films that involve gangs/mafias.",

The film plays so much like a minor imitation of \"Goodfellas\" that it's own voice gets lost in the process.  De Niro is, not surprisingly, a pretty good Scorsese imitator, but it still feels very much like an imitation.  Scenes that play out like Scorsese scenes are all just a little bit inferior ... the editing isn't up to Scorsese's standard or the music used is a bit too on the nose.  Lillo Brancato was cast because of his remarkable physical similarity to De Niro (he plays his son), but he's frankly not much of an actor.  He has a weird, uncomfortable physical presence and his delivery is a bit wooden ... a serious detriment when he delivers the film's \"Goodfellas\"-inspired narration (Ray Liotta is sorely missed).  De Niro and Paliminteri are both excellent,  but a lot of the other supporting roles, especially the actors playing kids, are frankly pretty terrible.  An interesting film with compelling themes, but just not quite good enough to invite such obvious comparisons to a genius.",

Palminteri accepted De Niro's offer, on the condition Palminteri wrote the screenplay and played one of the lead parts. It's a great mob film, and a coming of age film as well, showing a down and dirty side to life in New York, with a colourful cast along the way. Set between 1960 and 1968, it tells the story of Calogero Anello (Francis Capra/Lillo Brancato, Jr.), whose father Lorenzo (De Niro), drives a bus in the neighbourhood. Young Calogero is obsessed with the mobsters that frequent the bar next door to their apartment block, led by Sonny (Palminteri). After Calogero witnesses Sonny murder a rival gangster, he keeps quiet rather than rat Sonny out. As a result, Sonny takes a liking to Calogero, and has him doing odd jobs for him, which angers Lorenzo, who tells Sonny to stay away from his son, but Calogero still continues to see Sonny, and Sonny becomes something of a second father to Calogero, much to Lorenzo's ire. It has some very good performances throughout, with De Niro and Palminteri both playing off each other well, while the former shows confidence as a director, it's a shame he only has this and The Good Shepherd (2006) to his name, he should do more.",

Based on a play by Chazz Palminteri who wrote the screenplay and co-stars alongside De Niro, A Bronx Tale captures the racial tension in Bronx, New York in the 1960's and with it spins a coming-of-age drama with a distinctively gangster movie flavor. An Italian-American growing up on the streets of the Bronx is lured into the neighborhood mob led by the smooth, confident Sonny (Palminteri) who teaches the kid, Calogero how to survive the harsh environment of the neighborhood and a few life lessons that led him to success. The kid's father, Lorenzo (De Niro) heavily opposes the mob lifestyle, warning his son to keep away from the bar where the gangsters hang out, though the kid doesn't listen and for almost a decade continues to strengthen bonds with Sonny. As a teenager, Calogero and his circle of friends make their own mob of sorts, but Sonny tells \"C\" to stay away from them because they'll get him into trouble. C's tries to keep his association with the mob a secret from Lorenzo while attempting to spark a relationship with an African-American girl even though his neighborhood is hostile toward blacks. Teaming with timely music and clever and emotionally charged writing, A Bronx Tale shows off the directing talent of De Niro and that he really learned a thing or two from Scorsese after working with him for two prosperous decades.",

It does have some violence in it, but not a ton.  The film isn't very dark which gives it an interesting feel, and it actually has a lot of humor in it, which I liked a lot.  It was Robert De Niro's directorial debut, and he did just a well, as you would expect him to do.  The film felt like Goodfellas, but less brutal.  It had a few of the same actors, and it was similar because of the narrating.\n\nCalogero Anello (Age 17 (Lillo Brancato Jr.)) narrates the story from the point where he first got involved with Sonny (Chazz palminteri) when he was nine years old.  Like Henry Hill from Goodfellas he was a gangster when he was a kid.  Lorenzo Anello (Robert De Niro) drives the bus in their neighborhood, and they live next door to the bar that the mob hangs out in.  Part of the film is Lorenzo's struggle to keep his son from going over there.  Calogero (Age 9 (Francis Capra)) witnesses Sonny murder a man on the street in broad daylight.  The police line up all the suspects and tell him to identify who did it, and he doesn't rat them out.  He thinks he did a good thing but his father tells him \"You did a good thing for a very bad man.\"  \n\nCalegero goes to the bar and wins Sonny a lot of money playing crabs for him, and gets a cut of the winnings.  His father finds out about it and confronts Sonny to leave his kid alone.  It then flashes forward eight years and the guy who plays Calegero at age 17 (Lillo Brancato) looks like a really young Robert De Nero.  Calegero is a very smart kid, and is good friends with everybody in the mob.\n\nSonny teaches Calegero that it is tough to be feared and loved, but if you could only be one it is better to be feared.  He says you can't give them too much or they will walk all over you.  He also taught him what makes a great woman, and that you can only have three great ones.  The film is more about relationships that mob violence then movies like Goodfellas.  That makes it a more interesting movie.  He ends up falling for an African American girl named Jane, and that causes problems.  A lot of the things in this movie revolve around race, like the n-bomb gets dropped a lot.  Also they beat up a couple of black guys on the street just for being black in one scene.  That is the only bad part of the film.\n\nThe film was great.  It was really well acted, and they trained Francis Capra not to blink, which I thought was good.  I really liked this movie and I would put in in the top ten for gangster films.  If you like stuff like Goodfellas you will like this, though it is not as good as Goodfellas it is really good.",
