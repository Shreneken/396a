There's plenty of pulp but the twists can be legitimately great and unexpected, bringing actual guesswork to a medium that seemed to have exhausted the capacity for surprise. I want to talk about specific moments in this film, but everything verges on spoiler territory and the story builds off of each preceding coincidence in unexpected ways. If you want an engaging combination of entertainment, thriller, mystery, romance, musical, and heist film that defies convention through variety and unpredictability, Andhadhun is worth taking a look at.\n\nJust ignore the very brief use of CG. It ... does not look good. (3.5/5)",

            "content": "I can`t believe that I didn`t watch it till today.  Before the start, only based on the title, I thought it was a musical or an inspirational dream-chacing movie. It is far from it. Firstly, I always love a twist in a film. In the very end, it leaves the audience to judge whether our main character is really blind or not--- however, to answer this question seems too old a topic. Secondly, I love creating the main female character, who is like a femme fatale stepping out of a 50s film noir. She is attractive, smart, automatically strong, and cruel at the same time. The low-key lighting in the room when she broke into his room to kill his eyes, those oblique shadows on the wall, and many long shots of her leaning on the door ... but these are only in the first half of the film. This film is interesting because no one character is a consistent character from the beginning to the end. We can see the different intelligence in each character when they are leveraging what could be the best choice for themselves. In this sense, everyone is both antagonist and protagonist that they can turn to the other side in a minute. Even our main character, a talented, passionate, and simple-minded pianist, is implied to tell a lie to his beloved one. Everyone is so simple, and their aims are crystal clear and straight. And they are so cruel and real. The Shiva woman, her son, and the doctor want money, so they save the main character first but then turn to his back the next day. The leading woman wants to hide her love affair, so she tried to kill every witness without hesitation. And all the cruel sides of these people are covered by the sense of black humor, which enhances the sarcastic meanings. If we believe that our main character is telling a lie in the end, then we see the growing up of this character. It is more likely to be the right answer or explanation for the ending scene. Because only in this way the main character is like everyone else who does the thing, no matter what is morally good or bad, that can help to reach the aim--- this time is to win back the girl`s heart or to retain his fame as a successful and talented musician in the new city. If he lies, things are just like what it was initially-he pretended to be a blind pianist. But everything has changed. If his blindness used to help him focus on his music, now this blindness has encompassed more complex things that are not as innocent and pure as he was ever before.",

Not to stereotype, but it seems like its it's geared towards those who'd enjoy watching a longer Hispanic channel movie. The picture quality, focus, and framing are watchable but beyond that, there is little substance. \n(My siblings and I have a tradition of reviewing a movie and this was picked due to it's high rating. After watching my sister told me to save my time and not watch it because \"it was horrible\", which has never happened before. But I had to watch it for myself. I wouldn't say it was horrible, I could see a minute audience enjoying the film, but certainly has not been rated thus far, hence this submission.)",

            "content": "Siriam Raghavan's \"Andhadhun\" is a darkly comic, gripping and utterly unpredictable thriller that marks a new high for Bollywood Cinema. With his fifth feature, writer/director Siriam Raghavan has crafted a tense murder mystery involving a blind pianist. Using captivating cinematography, Raghavan draws viewers into the life of a blind pianist that unwittingly witnesses a murder. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. It gives the film a dark and ominous atmosphere that is reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. Raghavan's screenplay is also sensational, using genre-mixing to subvert the expectations of viewers. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is excellent. Ayushmann Khuranna delivers a star-making performance as Akash. With enthralling expressions, he conveys the fear, desperation and deceitful nature of a pianist that pretends to be blind. The supporting cast, which includes the scene-stealing Tabu, is also excellent and worthy of recognition. Although \"Andhadhun\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a flawless film. It builds to an ambiguous conclusion that leaves viewers with several questions. Nevertheless, fans of dark comedies will definitely enjoy \"Andhadhun\" and so will movie-goers seeking original entertainment. At a time when Bollywood Cinema seems to be running out of ideas, it's reassuring to be reminded that movies like \"Andhadhun\" are still getting made.",

            "content": "I am a huge fan of Ayushmann Khurrana. And this is one movie that absolutely nails it on every front. The story, the acting, the plot twist, the character development, and most importantly, the ending.\n\nThe story is set around Aakash, a man who is shown to be a blind pianist in the beginning of the movie. However after he meets Sophie, it's soon revealed in a surprising twist that he isn't blind after all. Every part of this movie is absolutely thrilling to watch, especially after that when he goes to Simi's house and sees her lover having murdered her husband. He has to keep calm and continue to pretend being blind even after all that, which as we can imagine is tough, to say the least.\n\nAfterwards when he leaves the house and immediately goes to the police station to report the murder, it turns out the cop, Manohar is the lover. And now he has to come up with an excuse about why he is in a police station immediately after Manohar had committed a murder. He takes his time to convince Manohar that he's blind, but fails to convince Simi. As a result she makes him blind for real. You can actually feel the tension in that scene.\n\nAfterwards he teams up with Murli and Sakhu, but they betray him and try to run away with Simi's money. They do get their comeuppance, but by then Aakash never sees them again. In the end when Aakash meets Sophie in London it seems kinda sad that Aakash has become blind, but then we get an immediate sense of joy when we see him knocking a can out of his way.\n\nI really hope in future we get to see more such movies. This movie is basically a message to tell us Bollywood isn't exactly hot garbage. If it wants not only can it make such good films, but people can actually even come to watch them. This movie absolutely deserved an Oscar and I see no reason why it wasn't even selected for it.",

At the beginning of the movie, he's acting like blind when he's alone. Clearly, to keep you inside an illusion. Later in the movie, after you understand the guy's blind, he acts normally alone. What a turn! The story unfolds towards possible romance yet it takes the director at least 30 min to introduce all the main characters. If you managed not to dislocate your jaw by yawning after half an hour of nothing much but views of Pune the director finally decides to add a twist to the story - a guy comes to the murder scene. That's where the comedy starts. All of a sudden a woman speaks on the phone to her husband, who's actually sitting shot dead in the next room. Boom! Mystery! Does she speak to the ghost? No, it's just remarkable screenwriting of this masterpiece. It turns out that the guy was gunshot straight into his forehead or so yet nobody noticed(read: heard) it, even blind pianist who's sitting next room. Probably he's not just blind, but also deaf and dumb. Don't worry, he's just pretending. After that, the comedy turns into a blockbuster - one murder after another, yet the main guy stays alive even after a mysterious poisoning, which makes him truly blind! How the murderer managed to do so, even the director of the movie doesn't know. If you wondering how check Google - that's what the killer did. I did so too, and guess what? I didn't find any. Okay, let's put it so - she apparently invented a new secret pharmaceutical remedy. She's Dr. Evil! But not as good as a doctor of the bankrupted hospital in Pune, who appears in the middle of the movie and tries to cut out the kidney of the blind guy! What a twist! Of course, if the hospital is in danger, the doctor will do anything to save it, even sell the organs. Yet, it rings the bell, when the doctor explains why he does it. Surprisingly, all the patients he was taking care of for the last decade abandonded him and went to the new hospital that got open close by. Pretty much life-like situation. For years people are being treated by their family doctor, yet the moment new hospital is open they abandoned him all at once. Doctor, along with his staff, goes turbo and captures poor blind pianist to cut him open. Still, you feel like watching to the end? Don't bother. It will end up somewhere in Europe or a place that looks like Europe. And it ends up pretty much with nothing. \n\nSix poor writers tried to make this story into something interesting and failed flat on their faces. I guess it's time for them to update their CV letters and call HR agents, cause this waste of time ain't not gonna make it to the red or any other color carpet.\nThe only good part of the movie is DOP work. It's done competingly well.",

This movie easily is one of the finest thrillers to ever come out of Bollywood and will go down as one of the best crime musicals, if there ever happens to be a genre like that. Ayushman Khurana has given a splendid performance as an experimental blind man who gets into so many things that it becomes a natural instinct of the audience to know and explore more about what happens to him.\n\nSriram Raghavan is modern day Vijay Anand, as a master crime caper specialist, he knows how to present his taste onscreen extremely well. Vivid but small setups haphazardly spread characters but bound together, highly contrasted and colorized shots, few colorful characters and a pace that never lets you think away about anything else other than next frame.\n\nI forgot when was the last time I saw a first half in Bollywood that was as intense as this one. Mark my words - the way first crime scene is picturized while the blind pianist plays symphonies while being a mute and blind spectator to a crime, is nothing short of a pure gold class masterpiece and will go down as an instant classic in the list of greatest scenes ever filmed in movies. The explicit parallels drawn between two extremes in that scene is wholly on another level and shows the Raghavan class we have been familiar with since ever. This movie takes his definitions of the depiction of crimes on whole another level after a gruesome depiction in Badlapur and a high shock value execution in Johnny Gaddar.\n\nMusical symphonies often represent the mood and put you at unease. Scenes with Beethoven Symphony 5 as background score are a great example of what a fine musical taste can do to an otherwise great scene in silos, and exalts the overall weight of a scene many times. Old Bollywood style tunes scattered in beginning and jazz music with high tempo gel extremely well with the fast-paced scenes.\n\nThe only weak point of the movie is that it disintegrates a bit towards the end where new characters are introduced and a new storyline gives albeit good support to the overall story by the climax. The cryptic end is another story to write home about. The one-eyed rabbit reference at the end jaw-droppingly resembles the dilemma of our blind protagonist without mincing any words. Only Sriram Raghavan could've come out with such insanely addictive attention to detail and nuanced filmmaking; nobody else.",

            "content": "If there's one Hindi movie you must watch this year, it is #Andhadhun. A testament to the genius that is Sriram Raghavan, it's thrilling, full of surprises and unexpectedly funny (We must remember Hitchcock made funny films). There are times when we and the characters onscreen gasp together and in other times we already know but the characters don't, and that's where the real fun starts.\n\nIn one of the film's best scenes, there's a plan being hatched to fix a corpse, an impersonate approaches, the corpse is fixed while a blind piano player plays the instrument. Now imagine all these in a single shot with no dialogues. The good thing is, moments like these are plenty.\n\nThe film packs in so much and everything is so intriguedly linked in this crazy Raghavan universe that it doesn't give you an opportunity to blink. Andhadhun is a rare treat, a film so compelling that it may univesally be considered irresistible. The only thing that this movie demands from you is attention, and once you surrender the experience gets even better. You can have blind trust on Andhadhun. From the first scene to the climax, there's something the makers have in mind for us. Go watch Andhadhun with full attention. It's worth every penny of your ticket.",

            "content": "The biggest gift a filmmaker can give you is by not forcing you to a one-dimensional narrative. Where in most of the Indian movies you can just know the whole story straight away by seeing the trailer, writers will force you to root for the characters they want you to, Sriram Raghavan breaks the stereotyping so well. He just tells you a story. There are no good, bad or ugly in it. From start to end you can never guess what will be the next turn on the story. So well written, well made and well cast. Ayushmann Khurrana, Radhika and legendary Tabu in their career never aimed for the stardom nor choose larger than life characters. They just acted and trusted in the materials. That's what makes them so unique and so relatable. Well done Team Andhadhun. For me the best movie of 2018 so far across any language and border.",
