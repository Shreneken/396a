    "summary": "In 1968, the elderly David \"Noodles\" Aaronson (Robert De Niro) returns to New York, where he had a career in the criminal underground in the '20s and '30s. Most of his old friends, like longtime partner Max (James Woods), are long gone, yet he feels his past is unresolved. Told in flashbacks, the film follows Noodles from a tough kid in a Jewish slum in New York's Lower East Side, through his rise to bootlegger and then Mafia boss -- a journey marked by violence, betrayal and remorse.",

            "content": "Sometimes, a movie isn't just a movie. It's something widely more important and meaningful, like a novel that comes directly from the pen of Tolstoj, Balzac or Flaubert. It overcomes the screen of the theather and follows you on everyday life because, like a great book, the art, the beauty, the meaning contained in it cannot be left in an angle, between dusty films and old libraries. Cinematography, due to its dual visual and sound aspect, unleash all the power of literature by making it more immediate and understandable. Leone, starting from the autobiographic novel \"The Hoods\" by gangster Harry Grey, has done that by creating probably the most beautiful gangster movie of all time (sorry Scorsese, I have to be utterly honest), and furthermore, a global icon of XX century cinema. It's hard to believe that an italian director has been able to build a so detailed representation of a whole part of american history, from the Twenties to the 60's, by following the character of David (Noodles) Aaronson, interpreted by an astonishing Robert De Niro, a Jewish gangster who appears, many decades later his departure, in NY again after an invite from the mysterious and wealthy senator Bailey. Noodles has been a protagonist of 30's mafia with his colleagues and friends, Maximillian \"Max\" Bercovicz, Philip \"Cockeye\" Stein and Patrick Goldberg. He will be the one who won't die in a car accident during a chase by the police. It's not just a mob-movie: it's a powerful and touching vision about the memories that history left on the road due to a structure that connects very dynamically past, present and future. The structure indeed does not follow the usual one, characterized by long flashback that sum up what has happened before the present: in Once Upon a Time in America Leone melts the three temporal dimensions by linking the scenes like a spider's web; a manipulation of time that finds its apex at the end, when the spectator is left with an existential doubt: was everything all just a dream? or it really happened?\nI could continue for at least the 4 hour of the movie, but I think I  will conclude here, not until having mentioned the original score by Morricone; it has became one of the most famous ever recorded: his pan flute in the Bugsy shooting remains unforgettable. A complete masterpiece.",

For one thing, the story is weak, it feels like a mash-up of standard 20th century mob movies.  The characters are even weaker.

The cinematography, images, scenery and locations are all superb and quite sweeping, while Ennio Morricone's score ranks up there with his very best. While the film clocks in at nearly four hours long, it never feels boring to me while the pace is quite elegiac everything else just compels you. I will admit, this is another film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it.\n\nSergio Leone's direction is also superb, the story is always compelling and rich and the dialogue is very thought-provoking. The characters are wonderful if different. Unlike The Godfather(not a bad thing by the way), Once Upon a Time in America doesn't make you feel sympathy for its characters, these characters are actually quite nasty people but the way they are written and acted makes them compelling too. The two rape scenes are very shocking and perhaps brutal, but again that's no flaw in any way, because this slant on crime and the like is quite realistic if you put it in perspective.\n\nThe acting is another strong asset. Robert DeNiro and James Woods, both are great actors, and both give brilliant performances. So overall, extraordinary, not only of its genre but of film full-stop. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

A directorial masterclass in story telling and construction with great work by so many including Woods, De Niro, McGovern and Williams amongst others. Beautiful score by Morricone and great sets and artwork. The unusual elements include the gangsters being Jewish and also the humorous treatment in places of some of themes such as the role of chance in life in the baby swopping scene. Moments of violence though are intense and explicit as usual. And so many great lines too. In the end we feel that Leone has taken genre cinema about as far as it can go with the sense of theatre and symbolism which dare I say it is almost Shakespearean as the circle is completed at the end and there is a deliberate reference to the theatre of the medium. Probably the nearest to great art that genre cinema can achieve leaving a deep sense of sadness and unusually for this director more of a sense of how can the male move forward rather than celebrate his dysfunction as in the spaghetti westerns (some of which were directorial tour de forces too despite the obvious severe limitations).",

The long run time is actually put to use fleshing out multiple points in the lives of these two and their gang, and gives you a real sense of empathy as well as a sense of investment in their ultimate fates. The narrative weaves throughout these narratives with an overall sense of mystery, given the story is hinted at but unresolved until its conclusion, and the circumstances that brought them to it remain clouded as well. The story doesn't pull any punches about the nasty nature of their way of life, and virtually every character has major flaws, which creates a refreshing sense of ambiguity in terms of the perception of the film's outcome, and how you perceive it. Make sure you watch the full version (229 min) rather than the abridged American one, which is no bueno. (4/5)",

This is one of my favorite Robert De Niro performances because he plays a character who is not glamorized and James Woods is excellent as the friend turned villain who has homoerotic interest in his friend. The Morricone score is as excellent as you would expect and Leone captures images of America so bursting with life that it's as though he's a documentarian. I love this film despite it's considerable length and many other flaws and I would encourage everybody to watch it.\n\nDavid \"Noodles\" Aaronson, Scott Tiler, Robert De Niro, is a weak young Jewish-American living in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York who has ambitions of becoming a gangster despite his lack of wills and attraction to aspiring dancer Deborah, Jennifer Connelly, Elizabeth McGovern. He meets Max, Rusty Jacobs, James Woods, who quickly befriends him and the two become successful child criminals together. Noodles is imprisoned but when he gets let out 12 years later Max has risen to the top of the criminal world and as he continues to chase a now wealthy Deborah he begins to question the acts that Max pushes him into. We see the story through a non-linear timeline and an elderly Noodles can be seen having flashbacks to various events as a storytelling structure.\n\nThe scenes of childhood feature particularly beautiful moments such as Noodles gazing at Deborah dancing through a hole in the wall, Noodles' friend eating a cream cake instead of sleeping with a prostitute and Max and Noodles' fateful meeting. These moments are shot beautifully with a nostalgic, orange tint to them and Morricone's iconic score, \"Deborah's Theme\" in particular, conveying the warm feelings of early childhood. We understand immediately the attraction between Noodles and Deborah and the many reasons why they keep apart because although she sees the good in him she knows he has no future. In some ways this syncs up to how the characters will appear as adults because the two ambitious children, Max and Deborah, end up together while Noodles marries a woman he did not know in his youth.\n\nThe best parts of the adulthood section of the film were the interactions between Noodles and Max after 12 years apart. It is here that we really see Max's attraction to Noodles shine through as he constantly attempts to distract Noodles from Deborah and keeps him in the fold even when he holds the team back. The tragedy of this is that because Max cannot have the straight Noodles romantically he feels the desire to take everything that belongs to him to initiate some form of contact with him. Humorous sequences such as the baby swapping were entertaining and beautifully shot although they were extraneous to the plot. I didn't enjoy this section of the film as much as his youth or his experiences as an elderly man. The rape scenes certainly didn't help nevertheless they are needed to show what a monster Noodles has become.\n\nThe final scene of Noodles in an opium den attempting to ignore the knowledge that his best friend, Max, has betrayed him is fantastic. Throughout the whole film we have understood that our protagonist is weak and easily malleable and Max is intelligent and manipulative but the prospect of him turning on his friend was still unprecedented. It works as a shock twist and Woods' performance as he begs Noodles to kill him was pitch perfect.\n\nYou may have to watch it in two sittings because it is incredibly long but it leaves indelible memories and conveys the important message that the gangster life tears you apart and should not be glorified. For such a dark film it is certainly enjoyable but don't watch it with your family if you want a pleasant viewing experience.",

            "content": "A former Prohibition-era Jewish gangster returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan over thirty years later, where he once again must confront the ghosts and regrets of his old life.\n\nThe way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut 4 hours & 11 minutes running time. \n\nOnce Upon A Time In America is the crowning achievement of director Sergio Leone. It demands total concentration from beginning to end. However,those willing to submit will find it more than worth it.\n\nWhat really makes this film different is it's overwhelming melancholy. Leone's favourite loyalty/betrayal theme is there,but the film is also a study of memory,of a lost soul coming to terms with his past. \n\nThe acting in this film is an absolute joy to behold. This is one of the best De Niro performances.While an unlikeable character, Noodles is a very interesting study of a broken life. He is matched every step of the way by an exceptional James Woods as Max. Woods has said that this is his favourite performance of his. The younger cast members, including a 10 year-old Jennifer Connelly, are especially effective during the flashback sequences. \n\nThe combination of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone is epic and the mix of actors are outstanding. Sergio Leone's epic crime drama is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting.",

            "content": "Once Upon a Time in America might be the worst movie I have ever sat through in my entire life. While there are other movies with worse production values or more incoherent scripts that I have hated, this is the first time I felt like the creators of the film actively hate me as a viewer. I first started to feel this way when the film breaks into a 20-minute-long flashback where a phone rings incessantly through the entire thing. That sequence alone would be an effective torture device to get someone to reveal anything they know. Thankfully I could utilize my mute button to make it stop, but theater audiences must have started bleeding from the ears. This is also the final chance that Sergio Leone had to try and convince audiences that despicable people can be protagonists too, so he pulls out all the stops. We are treated to a drug-addicted, lying, cheating, stealing, murdering rapist as the “hero” of the film. The big arc of change that he goes through leads him to refuse to kill someone that might be worse than him. I’m not even sure if I’m supposed to think he became a better man based on that finale. I guess he didn’t rape anyone in the last act of the film, so he’s got that going for him. But when you look at Once Upon a Time in America you have to address the elephant in the room (actually this is so massive it’s like a blue whale in the room.) This one crappy movie is longer than 3 good movies combined, and it doesn’t have enough plot to warrant even a quarter of the time. It’s that typical problem of a creator reaching a level of fame where no one will edit them or tell them “No.” But who cares about good pacing? All you have to do is slow everything down and make sure there’s a whole lot of silent pauses and you too can make a movie that is longer than your average baseball game. The other problem with making the movie this length is that Ennio Morricone has a problem getting in a rut by writing a small collection of short musical themes and repeating them incessantly even in normal length movies. At a certain point I was ready to mute the rest of the movie and watch with subtitles just so I could stop his Nature Boy riff that must hold a record for being the most repeated musical sting in a single film. The movie is so long and monotonous that it felt like Leone was daring people to quit, as if this was some kind of endurance test for the audience. There are times when I will write in hyperbole about feeling like I wasted my time watching a movie, but those movies were all amateurs compared to Once Upon a Time in America. I spent a good portion of the 4 hours while this movie was on in the background playing Candy Crush, and I think that was a more effective use of my time. I might have fallen asleep at one point while the movie was on, but it’s not like I missed anything. The plot of the movie is just the origin of a gang, and their eventual downfall. There are a handful of pointless subplots that go nowhere. Some of them I paid attention to, others I wouldn’t know if you were making them up out of whole cloth. I cared so little about anything that happened to these characters because they were all despicable, I kind of hoped they would all die at some point, and the world would be a better place. If possible, I would like to kick this movie in the nuts. If it wasn’t for the fees I’d have to pay, I would have destroyed the Once Upon a Time in America DVD rather than returning it to the library for some other fool to be subjected to this abomination.",

Bunches of gangster movies out there, ranging different levels from head-to-toe fighting views, the amount can be too countless to figure, to some masterpieces such as The Godfather and Goodfellas, barely deserve this praise, even though they are indeed tremendous. This movie, however, perfectly fits.\n\nLasting 251-minute long, which probably scares out of some audience from the very beginning in that regard. But just like tasting a bottle of liquor that has been preserved for decades, sipping it goes a longer way than normally drinking it. Begin with a scene in a small hotel, A wedge shaped like a human, a hooker shot by some gangsters who tried to pry into some information about someone else from her mouth but failed, you probably already got confused, this is exactly the best part of this film. The director, Sergio Leone, known as the trailblazer of horse opera, somehow did not follow the drills which he used to shot Once Upon A Time in the West: follow the timeline. The whole movie was cut into pieces, which is not a typical narration kind, he stuck oodles into the film, on top of which made spectators feel that not only one thing being told through the whole movie, The truth is, on the contrary, all clues lead to the leading role: Noodles, who was always loyal to his friend, at least the way he judged whoever as his pal, and was always loyal to his beloved girl, at last got screwed by all of them. He stuck to his own principles, which made him live and get away clean, but also drove him to poorer and sad.\n\nNoodles, grow up in Brooklyn in 1900s, had not ever count on some love from parents, he had no aspiration, only concentrated on some unprofessional gangster activities which are the usual routines of mobs: collecting protection fees, smashing the part of one shop if the owner of it refuse to pay, and of course, hiding in a toilet to peeped the silhouette of that girl whom he yearned for, day in and day out, something like that. At that point, Max, a guy who almost changed the whole life of Noodles, showed up for the first time in front of Brooklyn Bridge, the landmark of New York city, where the childhood memory was left forever, also can be considered the great symbol of that real friendship of these \"little goodfellas\". Max is by no means a guy who always wanted to be a street mob, he had his own plan for his life, a selfish but fantastic dream, which came true from the mid-part of this movie: running a casino, flirting with some politicians and successfully grabbed them in his palm, betraying all his partners in order to control the whole kingdom made by them, to name a few, which he did great, leaving noodles regret for Max' death (false one) given the phone call to the police intrigued by Max. Noodles, still chose to hold faith to that dead body was Max for mathematical certainty, or maybe it was just his way to mourn the long gone friendship. Deborah, Noodles' s beloved girl, as it was mentioned before, gave up her love for her own business, married Max and even born him a son, all of which later on are found by Noodles but what can he do except accepting it and burring inside his heart. This is how the whole society works, some people are always for powers while others trust friendship and love, it is just a matter of our own choice. Neither way did pan out till the last, but I really can not figure out what was the right thing to do, just like the title, maybe it is to certain extent a \"once upon a time\" in America.\n\nOur emotion is successfully influenced by that bravo background music, one theme can be made into different tunes, seamlessly matches the upcoming events as well as what we are watching. Life is a melody, up and down, vicissitudes always exist, just like we all have our past, our story, like this one, as it happened in America, from pre Word War 2 to abolish of 18th amendment.\n\nBy the way, those executives of Warner Bros. Pictures must regret for what they did to the movie back then, if some of them still are in charge, for sure.",

It has some shots where it focuses way too much on the character and you're thinking like, uhmm what's gonna happened next, I'm staring with him or her too much. Which is kinda awkward but it is pretty effective to be honest. You can see those actors emotions very well. The only part that I kinda hate in this film is the structure of the story line.

This section lays a good foundation and has charm, but meanders often. When they're in their mid-30's, it feels more strained and the film lost me at the rapes. It then turns into a mystery, with 65 year old Noodles trying to piece the last 30 years together. The ending was a big let down for me. Still, a vaunted effort.",

Yes, better than the big dogs. \nComparing the 3 (which is close to impossible) Goodfellas is a much more stylized, hollywoodization of a mob's story, and The Godfather Part 1 is so different, it's hard to compare, i personally think it's a better film. \nOnce Upon a Time in America is much more real, dark, gritty, emotionally driven movie, it paints a perfect picture of what gangsters were like in the '30's and how New York was like for over five decades. It's much more intriguing and complex than Goodfellas and The Godfather, and Once Upon a Time in America is what i wanted from The Godfather Part 2 and never got.\n\nTo stop with the comparing, Once Upon a Time in America is a 4 hour gangster epic, and you might think ''well, 4 hours that's way to long for any movie'' for this movie, it isnt. It needs all 4 hours, and you can clearly see that because each and every single scene has a purpose and meaning, there isnt one scene where you think that a scene could've been scrapped. \nBecause each scene has purpose, and the time line switches continuously you need to be active as a viewer, which is what a 4 hour movie needs. The 4 hours fly by like its a 2 hour movie. It captures accurately growing up in the 30s,40s, & 50s of America. The roots of what made this country unique verses other nations. Diversity here was astronomical then transformed many ethnic backgrounds into pivotal characters impacted this country as well.\nAs I said, each scene is 100% needed, because when this movie was released in 1984, the theaters thought the movie was way to long and cut it down from its original and intentional length of a whopping 229 minutes to a 144 minutes version, and it became an incoherent mess of a movie, which is the sole reason this movie didnt get nominated for any Oscars, which is a shame. \nNevertheless, Once Upon a Time in America could have Won 11 Oscars, i'm not exaggerating. \nIt could have won for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor for De Niro, Woods and McGovern, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Art- and Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Original Score from Ennio Morricone.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in America is the best gangster movie ever made, and the best coming of age story ever put to film.",

Some good-for-nothings will no doubt take issue with the fact that I'm including it on the all-time best Paranoid movies list, but I am the best paranoid and it is MY list! And I will explain why at the end of this review!\nIf you want to know what \"life\" looks like, because you're standing too close to it, or like me, have an aversion to mirrors, then this movie is probably your best bet.\n\nStretching over three decades it tells the life story of David \"Noodles\" Aaronson, played by Robert De Niro, and his Jewish gang mates but not in a chronological sequence, which would probably take much longer than the allotted 229 minutes running time. In fact, it's fair to say you'd probably be dead before the end of it and no movies worth that!\n\nNoodles steps in and out of the most important times in his life, interwoven like a hallucinogenic dream from the paranoid opium pipe he smokes. I've never smoked opium, I'll quickly add, but I imagine it has that same vividness of memory or reality whilst being imaginary, or an illusion, which kind of borders on the existentialist nature of this movie. Sorry, am I getting too far up on myself? Wouldn't be the first time - won't be the last!\n\nThe theme of the story is friendship, what makes a friend, who is a friend; can friendship die? (You can't get more paranoid than that!) This theme is literally and figuratively illustrated beautifully in this timeless epic about time, or rather with \"time\" as another almost paranoid character, dying itself. It made me cry.\nSometimes you can only work out life by writing about death, but there you go, kid.\n\n- See more at: http://www.principalegg.com/reviews/review-of-the-top-10-most-paranoid-movies-of-all-time",

The result is a sprawling, exhausting but utterly compelling crime drama which despite it's epic length, is the sign of a true master filmmaker at work. In the slums of Brooklyn in New York, it focuses on 4 friends who grew up together in the 1920's and into the 1930's. David \"Noodles\" Aaronson (Robert De Niro), Max Bercovicz (James Woods), Patrick \"Patsy\" Goldberg (James Hayden) and Phillip \"Cockeye\" Stein (William Forsythe), who went from small time robberies to bootlegging during the Prohibition. Noodles spent nearly a decade in prison for avenging the death of a friend at the hands of Bugsy (James Russo). But after the Prohibition is repealed, it gives the gang very little to do, until the gang suggest robbing a bank, but Noodles soon has second thoughts and has to make a dramatic decision. It's a shame Leone spent so long between A Fistful of Dynamite (1971) and this, he had so many great ideas for films, but he relinquished his ideas to other directors, but he saved the best ones for himself, like this one, which trumps The Godfather trilogy. Leone was left heartbroken when his cut was butchered in America, he never directed again.",

And there is another kind of films that no matter how long they are, they still glue the audience to their seats without any desire to get up. Ironically enough, \"Once upon a Time in America\" encompasses both kinds - the heavily (and criminally) edited version by the ignorant and stupid Hollywood executives is the pinnacle of the first kind, whereas the original, 4-hour plus version by Sergio Leone himself is one of the most beautiful, heart-breaking, masterfully epic film I have ever seen in my life. Yes, in my life. What in the world did I think drifting around watching crappy films while hesitating to watch this film \"due to its length\"? Some people consider this film a Sergio Leone's \"The Godfather\", I myself also think that in the depiction of the criminal underworld and the broken \"American dream\", this film can be considered a sentimental and nostalgic \"The Godfather\". But in fact the two films are quite different. \"The Godfather\" is a bridge connecting the old, and classic, Hollywood, to the \"New Hollywood\" that is absolutely innovative and modern despite its classical storyline. On the other hand, \"Once upon a Time in America\" has a non-linear storylines and  more progressive feeling but is in fact a profoundly classical treatment of characters and tells the eternal tale of friendship, love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal - the thematic subjects that have been told in Shakespearean plays and even before that. As such, watching the film was really an overwhelmed experience to me. The film is a complex web of storylines and characters, but they are all wonderfully depicted through a very, very well-told plot that makes the audience cherish every single minute passing by. Every detail of the film fascinates me profoundly, from the nostalgic setting of an ever-changing New York City, to the pure beauty of the characters in their young appearance (I have admired Jennifer Connelly for a long time, but I have never known that she was such an angel in young ages!), to the heart-breaking love story between Noodles and Deborah, the friendship of the \"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\", everything. [SPOILER ALERT!] And the final revelation that everything, everything, everything in the film is just opiated dream of Noodles (before he was killed by the henchmen, I suppose) - an \"once upon a time in America\" tale that he told himself to soothe the pains inflicted by a broken dream, a broken love story, a broken friendship. Maybe this interpretation is purely my speculation, but it will probably my view of this film forever. This film made me so overwhelmed, really. My oh my.",

            "content": "Once Upon a Time in America is a perfectly crafted masterpiece by Sergio Leone which covers the lives of four Jewish boys in New York City. The film covers from the 1920's right up until the 1960's, the long period of time covered is well put together into three sections, the 1920's, the 30's and then the 60's. The film really captures the period it is set in and the location with one hundred percent accuracy, which enhances the experience a great deal. The acting I felt was just superb, not one actor/actress in the movie did a bad job in their roles, beside being what I feel is De Niro's best performance, James Woods really stands out in the film, the two both give fantastically emotionally fuelled performances which should have easily been an oscar nomination for best actor of that year. Although many avoid the film because of it's running time, I felt this was a great bonus, it would have been a crime if the film was only one and a half to two hours long, as every second of the film is jaw droppingly impressive. The newly released Extended-Director's Cut is something I need to see, this extended cut adds an additional twenty two minutes to the two hundred and twenty-nine minute running time. I cannot understand why the film didn't pick up any wins or nominations for that matter, the only reasons I can put it down to is the cut made for cinema, in cinemas at the time of it's release, the film had to be trimmed down to one hundred and thirty-nine minutes which meant viewers weren't seeing the finished product. Even in the 229 minute version there are still some scenes which I feel were scrapped, the main one is when Joe Pesci's character walks into a hospital and presses an elevator button, then the scene cuts, I feel that there is even more of the movie we are not seeing which is a great shame.The movie isn't your average gangster flick, this is a film based around tormented souls, relationships, love, greed , betrayal and power that has such lasting resonance. The film does leave us with some unanswered questions, whether max did throw himself into the garbage shredder or whether the whole 1960's sequence was just an opium dream. The one thing that is certain is that this film is a triumph of cinema. 5/5",

This is a hard film to start though, since it's nearly four hours long and on a subject I don't usually like (gangsters). I'm on a bit of a gangster streak at the moment though, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nThis was Leone's last film but I'm surprised at how fresh and new it seems. His westerns had started to seem a little stale, as if he'd run out of things to say, so I felt he was on a bit of a declining spiral. Not so. He'd just gotten bored with westerns. This film is both pure Leone and something else, something new and exciting I wish had had time to develop. Visually it shares his love of closeups and long scenes with minimal dialogue, but not much more. The photography looks sharper and more precise while the shots get more natural and the editing less rough. The scene here is cityscape and it makes all his typical shots change to something new and different. It didn't feel as bizarre and iconically unnatural as a Leone movie usually does and surprisingly that really works for the film instead of being a drag.\n\nLeone loved playing with genre conventions and distorting them to his own end. Part of what bores me with gangster films is that they're always a series of selfish murders followed by inevitable betrayal and death, the only question being how and by whom. Here Leone lays it all out in the opening five minutes. Noodles (our lead) is the one who betrayed his friends and now they're dead while he feels guilty. It's a tremendously risky move (and one that scared the studio execs who recut it into chronological order for the initial release) but it pays off because the tension now becomes how and why that opening scene came to pass. The film takes place across three time periods: Noodles as an old man in the '60s, as a young man in the '20s, and as a kid in the '10s. All have their own story arcs and all keep the mystery alive. Yes, it has a hard time maintaining momentum over the running time but that's a danger with all his films.",

You are enticed into wanting to empathise with De Niro's character Noodles, but are suspended in state of ambiguous indifference after two brutal and upsetting rape scenes. Like Eastwoods anti-hero in High Plains Drifter, who perpetrates his own reprehensible assault on the town lush, you are left divided and uncertain where to attach your loyalty. Scarface was a bad man with few redeeming qualities, but you understood that from the start, and comforted by the knowledge he would get his just desserts eventually. Noodles neither elicits any real sympathy nor overriding dislike, so by the end I had lost interest in his fate and ultimately stopped caring about the eventual outcome of the film. Orherwise the filmography, scene arrangement and costumes etc were very good, with one main exception. The make-up department obviously had the day off when filming the scene involving Elizabeth McGovern's older version of her character Deborah, as she still looked in her thirties instead of pushing 70. They managed to depict De Niro and Woods as older men convincingly, so this oversight was slightly peculiar. Overall it was a good film, but lacking a strong character hook to keep you riveted through its long run time.",

The story of these gangster boys growing to be men captured me and I had little difficulty seeing such a long film through. There are no shortage of stars held within this film including Robert De Niro, James Wood and Danny Aiello. I found at least one scene uncomfortable so be warned, this film gets harsh at times.

In the background of the entire movie is a hidden theme of finding one's morals. I felt a true sense of purpose with this movie, like no other movie ever will.

Nevertheless, \"The Godfather\" portrayed the Corleone family as kind criminals, and \"Goodfellas\" had too little heart for me. Of course, I'm comparing some of the best films of all time and nitpicking. Then comes \"Once Upon a Time in America,\" a film with enough heart, and rugged truth about mob-life to rival the two above films. Director Sergio Leone left with guns blazing (no pun intended) with his final feature.Its an epic-crime drama revolving around a Jewish boy and his Jewish friends who start off as hooligans and become elevated into the mafia. The score by Ennio Morricone, arguably the best film composer, is beautiful and evokes a certain melancholia that I have never felt in a film. The cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli is magnificent and fits the epic tale perfectly. The large bridges and buildings are captured perfectly as well as the small dimly lit rooms I truly believe that he is the most underrated cinematographer of all time. The screenplay written by a whopping eight people is the heart of this film. It does not pose us easy questions. It does not give us easy answers. That is what life is truly like. The mafia is portrayed as grotesque in an honest way. They do not care about anyone except for themselves and their money. I applaud Leone for shooting some extremely brutal scenes for this film without hesitation. You live the life of the main character, David 'Noodles' Aaronson, for four hours. It is not a pretty life, but at least it is depicted truthfully. The cast is filled with big names like DeNiro, Pesci, James Woods, etc. None of them disappoint and my favorite performance has to be a toss up between Woods and DeNiro.  \"Once Upon a Time in America\" is a miraculous epic which is perfect in every technical way and is my favorite mob movie since it asks difficult questions, does not give us concrete answers, and reveals the cold-hard truth behind the mafia.",

Once Upon a Time is the only film that Leone got to direct outside of the western genre and certainly ranks among the great filmmaker's works. Here, Leone is particularly not afraid to push the boundaries of the anti-hero structure and sugar coating his lead characters by painting them as lowlife hoodlums and giving way to some disturbingly violent scenes mixed with an atmosphere of melancholia which makes this one of the most compelling films of the crime genre and the anti-Godfather par excellence. Apart from it being thematically and psychologically compelling, the film is also a visually majestic, with its wonderful sets and astounding cinematophaphy which highlights the perfectionism of its filmmaker. Furthermore, it is yet another fantastic collaboration between Leone and Morricone, whose score for Once Upon a Time in America is among the best he ever composed.",

The cast here are all terrific from James Woods in his best performance, to Joe Pesci to Elizabeth McGovern as Deborah and Robert De Niro as the infamous \"Noodles\". Some people have criticized the film for being too long. To those people I say \"Who Cares?\", if you can watch a two and a half hour crappy Transformers movie then you might as well watch another hour or so of masterful storytelling. No Sergio Leone movie would be the same without Ennio Morricones' scores and Once Upon a Time in America is no different. The film is scored to perfection and the soundtrack really helps you feel many emotions during the film. Once Upon a Time in America is an epic gangster/mobster movie and only second to Francis Ford Coppela's Godfathers and Martin Scoresese's movies of the same genre.",

As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting.\n\nAnd to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds.\n\nHere, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel alot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs alot of The Godfather and is a standalone story.\n\nAnd not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature.\n\nAnd that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch.",

In addition, there was overacting from almost everyone. \n\nIt was full of illogical and silly scenes. Some of the worse parts were Max repeating \"don't call me crazy\" and then going nuts (joke in itself)! And Noodles raping a girl during the robbery (who does that?) and then raping the love of his life in the limo (beyond stupid). And Noodles driving the car off the pier with all his buddies (absolutely stupid).   And who can forget the haunting final words of the little boy; \"I slipped\"...(more silly dialogue.)  \n\nOverall, it is a silly movie, not worth recommending, and definitely, not worthy of its 87% on RT (in my humble opinion).

I guess I have to say, for the record, that I have seen it before but it's one of those films that stays with you for a very long time afterwards. Even though it's been many years since I last saw it, I could still remember much of the plot as I was re-watching it. It was like re-acquainting myself with an old friend. But I digress; here's an extremely brief summary before I give you my thoughts.\n\nWe are told the story of four friends; David 'Noodles' Aaronson (Robert De Niro), Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz (James Woods), Patrick 'Patsy' Goldberg (James Hayden) and Philip 'Cockeye' Stein (William Forsythe). We learn how, from an early age, they find themselves involved in illegal activities and how this shapes their lives. We learn about their loves; Deborah Gelly (Elizabeth McGovern) among them; and the many people they do business with, including Frankie Manoldi (Joe Pesci). Oh, and I mustn't forget Deborah's brother, 'Fat' Moe Gelly (Larry Rapp); he has a part to play in all this as well. It's mostly told in flashback as 'Noodles' returns to his old neighbourhood after thirty years in exile. It's an epic tale with many twists and turns along the way; but in the end it does all make sense. Oh and look out for a young Jennifer Connelly as the young Deborah.\n\nI first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly-sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so).\n\nSteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED \n\nMy score: 8.2/10.",

His directional work on Once Upon a Time in America can only be described as being worthy of an Academy Award. If this film wasn't cut in 1984, it would have won multiple Academy Awards.\nOnce Upon a Time in America features an excellent story that is told perfectly and makes it one of the most fine Gangster films in the history of cinema, and is strongly convincing thanks to it's great costumes, beautiful setting, plot dynamics, intense mood and excellent acting.\nRobert De Niro is the great lead as usual with his ability to portray a criminal that we support and feel for, and yet never judge. His performance flips the characterisation back and forth through criminalistic and human.\nJames Woods gives great support to the story and turns his character around from a smart powerful teenage to a manipulative villainous gangster without mercy or a second thought to his actions. He portrayed a powerful villain.\nJennifer Connelly added a second plot line to the story in her portrayal of a woman involved with De Niro which becomes her own undoing.\nOnce Upon a Time in America also featured excellent performances from it's your cast which really added masterful drama to the story and good small parts by Joe Pesci and Burt Young.\nThe only real flaw I found with Once Upon a Time in America was that since the first half was so excellent and heart-pounding and the second half was a lot slower and more character based, things sorta slowed down a bit. \nBut nothing can stop Once Upon a Time in America from being what it is: a masterpiece that was mishandled upon it's original release and an unforgettable crime epic that has qualities that obviously influenced Quentin Tarantino.

It's rare that I like anything with so many gazing long takes, but the exquisite score by Ennio Morricone brings out all the feelings they're supposed to evoke. First Leone movie for me, and I really like his style. The photography and set design in here are some of the best I've ever seen, with several iconic images. Not unlike the subsequent Goodfellas, none of the characters, save perhaps Deborah, have many redeeming qualities. I definitely felt soiled after watching this, with all its gory murders, rapes, and debauchery; yet the movie's introspective side, in contrast with the sordid stuff, creates an uneasy and complex tone. I can't say that I loved it unreservedly; there were scenes and dialogue I found odd or not up to par, particularly the acting of the kid actors in the first section. It's easy to claim this outclasses the Godfather, but I prefer the latter, after first viewings. I get the feeling those who make that claim relish feeling unconventional; the Godfather is a remarkable achievement, very realistic, sumptuously designed, and well written and acted. However I may have reacted on the first viewing, I simply can't stop thinking about this afterward, remembering certain scenes, expressions, and especially the beautiful music. The movie in its quieter moments has such a hypnotic, sorrowful quality about it. I will have to come back to this some time, and see if it doesn't win me over a little more. Now, having seen some of the epics of the 70s and 80s -- the Godfathers, the Deer Hunter, and now this -- I feel ripped off that movies of this length and scope are rarely made anymore unless part of a blockbuster fantasy or comic book series. Even Cloud Atlas was only ten minutes shy of three hours, a movie much in need of more running time. The best may be yet to come though with the high production values and lack of content restrictions on basic and premium cable channels.",

            "content": "No, Really, I Think I Could Have Understood a Shorter Version  \r\n\r\nActually, what I don't understand is why so many men in movies have sex in front of their male friends.  This isn't just a Sergio Leone thing, though watching three of these movies in such rapid succession is what brings it most strongly to mind.  However, I've seen it in a lot of other works of fiction, too.  Sometimes, it's rape, and sometimes, there are prostitutes.  But sometimes, they're just having sex with women in front of each other, and that's just a thing that is going to happen.  Now, I don't know how much this happens in real life, and I'm not sure I want to know.  I think, in the movies, it's intended to show how close these guys are, that they don't have secrets of any kind from one another.  Leaving aside that this is [i]never true[/i], it also strikes me as kind of a weird way of demonstrating that to each other, much less to the audience.\r\n\r\nThe film is long and does not follow a straight line chronologically, but bear with me.  David \"Noodles\" Aaronson (Robert De Niro) has returned to his old neighbourhood after many years away.  When he was a boy and played by Scott Schutzman Tiler, he befriended another boy, Max Berkovicz (Rusty Jacobs).  They run a few cons together, get involved in some minor bootlegging.  Then, Noodles is sent to prison.  When he comes out, Max is James Woods and runs quite a nice little crime organization.  They're running liquor.  They've got a speakeasy set up behind a traditional Jewish deli.  And so forth.  Really, for the time, they have a very nice set-up, if you leave aside the constant danger.  Noodles is in love with Deborah Gelly (Elizabeth McGovern) since she was Jennifer Connelly (in her first role!), and he tries to use the power and wealth he's gained to woo her, but she leaves him to be an actress.  And then, as Prohibition winds to its close, Max tells Noodles that he wants to knock over the Federal Reserve Bank . . . .\r\n\r\nI also want to know why so many of these movies feature rapes.  Noodles is supposed to be sympathetic.  I'm sure of this.  I'm not sure we're supposed to [i]like[/i] him, but I am sure we're supposed to be on his side.  And I just couldn't be after he raped Deborah.  It just wasn't possible.  He had been holding on to this one true, good thing all this time.  She knew the whole time that he wasn't worth it to her if his mob ties came along with it, and she was making her decision to get out.  She had been teasing him since she was a child, true, but that doesn't mean anything.  She not only said no, she actively fought him.  She made it very clear that she did not want to have sex with him.  And then he sends her home and stands around looking all sad, and we're supposed to feel sorry for [i]him[/i]?  No.  No, not even a little.  And while an apology isn't much after that experience, he doesn't even ever seem to have given her one.\r\n\r\nOh, the real serious relationship is the friendship between Max and Noodles, of course.  They are friends, and that is supposed to be surpassing the love of women.  It strikes me that there are plenty of clues that perhaps not all is well with their friendship even before the dramatic events of that last night.  However, we're totally not supposed to think that perhaps they might want to give up on women altogether.  Oh, I agree that they shouldn't allow women to interfere with their business--unless they'd encountered a woman who was particularly good at the business, I suppose.  However, it seems that they aren't much interested in just keeping the women out of the business.  Max resents like crazy that Noodles is more interested Deborah than him.  He wants to be more important.  It isn't even just that he wants Noodles along for planning a job or whatever.  It's that he needs to be the most important thing in his friend's life.  I don't think all male friendships are homoerotic, but sometimes, you wonder.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing brings up much discussion about the two different cuts, of course.  Leone himself basically refused to acknowledge the cut that was released to American theatres; he considered it butchered.  However, there were plenty of bits that I could see being left out yet doing no real danger to the story.  The Teamsters thing, for example.  Oh, I know that Leone wanted to talk about the influence that the unions and organized crime had a bit to do with one another.  It was a story worth telling, to be sure, but I'm not sure it really belonged here.  I'm a bit fond of Treat Williams, based on exposure to [i]Hair[/i] at an early and impressionable age, but he just feels tacked on.  It's fascinating to me that Sergio Leone decided to make a film set not in the great, vast sweeps of the American West-as-filmed-in-Italy but instead the narrow confines of the [i]shtetls[/i] of New York.  However, I think the movie lacks focus, and that's probably the real problem with the short version--it's not because it's too short.  It's just that they cut the wrong bits.",

Leone has crafted every scene that was so distinctly storyboarded in his mind that it transfers to the screen like the fruits of the most beautiful apple tree. But every apple is rotten, infected with worms and stinking with a rich odour, but Leone captivates you so much that you want to pick every apple and check if has at least one good bite. There are no likeable characters, and some of their actions are so vile but you are engrossed in their story for the entire 4 hours run time. Without giving anything away, he takes such incredibly bold steps in narrative, only such an established and invested director could achieve. The non-linear format is marvellous, and it flows in wonderful transitions and even if you're not always up to speed you huff and puff until you catch up. That is just the way the film has been created, let alone the magnificent performances through the whole cast with Robert De Niro the mesmerizing nucleus. The only nit picks I do have is that I sometimes got lost in it's scale and characters but it just makes me want to watch it again.

            "content": "The Italian director Sergio Leone is known for his excellent westerns: Spaghetti Western trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West. After long-standing commitment to westerns, the director chose to step outside his comfort zone and make an epic crime film Once Upon a Time in America. The film initially received mixed reception but has since been justly acknowledged as a great contribution for crime film genre. \n\nThe story of Once Upon a Time in America spans almost 50 years starting from the 20's, a decade renown for total ban of alcohol - the Prohibition - in America. It was an era where smuggling and production of alcohol ran rampant and led to the rise of American gangsters such as the Al Capone and others. Thus the 20's offer a perfect setting for a crime film where David 'Noodles' Aaronson (Robert De Niro) and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz (James Woods), two poor jewish boys struggle to survive in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Once Upon a Time in America tells how Noodles and Max rise to prominence in New York criminal world in epic 3h 39min film of friendship, love, lust and betrayal.\n\nIt is tempting to compare Once Upon a Time in America with the all time mafia classic The Godfather, but in truth the films only share the theme together. Where The Godfather depicts the Italian mafiosos in romanticed manner with straightforward storyline, Once Upon a Time in America offers a more realistic depiction of the 20's with a complex plot spread over four decades. The other striking difference is where The Godfather offers charming and easy to relate to characters, Once Upon a Time in America's characters are in comparison deeply flawed and overall challenging to like. Bit controversially it is the way Leone presents these flawed characters which make Once Upon a Time in America so compelling. Some of the scenes and character actions can be considered down right repulsive, but they do manage to depthen the characters in ways which few films can match. \n\nThe fact that Once Upon a Time in America's story is spread over long period of time and contains multiple parallel angles adds up complexity. Thankfully Leone masterfully keeps this gargantual film together and in retrospect it really shows that the film was over 10 years in the making. The end result is polished and highly engaging piece of cinematography which is guaranteed to make a permanent impression on the viewer.",

Leone passed up the \"The Godfather\" because he already had this in mind, and he worked on it for about 15 years before he finally was able to make his 4 and half hour epic.  Hopefully, all the rights issues can be cleared up so the complete version of the film can be released (right now about 25 minutes are missing from the latest release version).  The film is wonderfully shot, and features some of Leone's best work, with a great cast headed up by Robert DeNiro.

            "content": "Sergio Leone's 1984 crime drama Once Upon a Time in America has been made out to be the next great crime epic in the tradition of The Godfather. Only instead of following an Italian crime family like we did in the The Godfather movies, we follow a Jewish mafia for three decades. Given the praise critics and audiences have been bestowing upon this picture, I expected to be blown away by this. But sadly, I thought this film in the end was a huge, huge disappointment. Just like Scarface a year earlier, this is yet another ripoff of The Godfather that does nothing except demonstrate everything that is dull and lifeless about the crime film genre. \n\nI have no idea how to sum up the story for this picture aside from saying that it's about five guys (Robert DeNiro, James Woods, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Larry Rapp) in the Jewish mafia and the events they undergo from the 1920's to the 1930's during the Prohibition era. The first problem I have with Once Upon a Time in America is the film's story being told in non-chronological order. I don't have a problem with films that use different storytelling methods as long as I'm able to have a basic idea of what's happening in the plot. If I can't understand the film's plot which is the case with this film, then how am I expected to get into the plot and care about the characters involved in it? \n\nWhile I realize that this part of the picture is intended to show us how the characters came together, I thought the first hour or so of this nearly four hour picture really sucked mainly because I didn't care for the acting from the kids and teens playing the main characters. I just felt that the acting was too painful to sit through and the lines they were given were absolutely terrible. \n\nFurthermore, I thought the film's sound editing and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack were incredibly annoying. During the first flashback Robert DeNiro's character has in this flick, the phone is ringing and it doesn't stop ringing for at least 10 MINUTES! Not only that, but the phone's also ringing IN THE FLASHBACK!! While I realize that it's doing something that hasn't been done before, it's still unbelievably obnoxious to listen to. Along with the soundtrack being extremely repetitive, there are also similar sound editing pet peeves that kept adding up to the point where I couldn't stand listening to this film. \n\nThe only positive aspects I could come up with in describing the quality of this film is that the acting by DeNiro and Woods are pretty good and that the production design of this film is authentic to the eras that the plot was set in. Aside from that, there isn't much else to say about this film except that it's a boring letdown. Along with the overly confusing and long story, the annoying soundtrack, and the lousy first quarter of the picture, I also found the ending to be similarly awful in that it closes on a very creepy and unnecessary freeze frame/close-up of DeNiro's face. \n\nI realize that this film is considered to be one of Leone's finest films, I recognize that many critics and audiences highly endorse this flick, and I know it's considered one of the best of the crime genre. If you still enjoy this film, that's fine. I won't hold anything against you because you like it and I think it's great that you're happy with this film. After all, you're entitled to your opinion. In the end, Once Upon a Time in America just isn't my type of film and it didn't meet my expectations at all.",

The movie's surprise ending is based on the premise that Noodles didn't know that Max was alive. But in an age of media publicity, this is hard to believe. I'm sure Noodles would have seen the senator's picture in the papers.\n   The movie is partly a mediation on gangsterism and American culture, and it's also about the fragility of friendship.

His direction controlled and purposeful, Sergio Leone takes us on a ride of a lifetime, spanning five decades from the Prohibition era, via the story of crime and greed, of brotherhood and betrayals. Out of a seemingly unorganized jumble of flashbacks, dreams, and either one within the other, all of them strung together by inspired transitions, there emerges a gripping narrative that keeps us guessing at every turn. Robert De Niro, as expected, all but perfects his role as Noodles, seldom needing lines where looks are more than sufficient. James Woods, playing Max the best friend, is the total surprise; while his unhinged moments may not come close to Joe Pesci's in Goodfellas, they are still convincing and unsettling. The friendship between Noodles and Max carries the movie, and its development is absolutely fascinating to watch. But what's most amazing is how much life Ennio Morricone's score breathes into the movie. The movie's length is considerable, but need not be intimidating so long as the execution excels expectations, which Leone's does with seeming ease.",

            "content": "I can't tell if this was Sergio Leone making up for not doing \"The Godfather\" (Wow, and if you though Coppola's version was long enough) or deciding to take such a departure from formula that he not only left the western genre, but didn't focus quite as much on Italians. If he was gunning for the latter, then maybe he could have done a better job when it came to deciding on which other ethnicity to focus more on, because in New York and a couple of other areas, the differences between Jews and Italians are so scarce that I'm kind of against religious compromise, because if the Italian Catholics and Jews were to form a single religion and shake hands, then the universe would probably collapse in on itself from a paradox spawned from two totally tantamount forces colliding. Anyways, mine and I'd imagine Hutton Gibson's crazy theories aside, Leone's supposed departure from Italian over-focus isn't helped by the fact that he decided to make the lead Robert De Niro, and I'm not just saying that because De Niro actually is, well, come on, just look at the name, but because, from the '70s to '80s, if you had a sprawling crime epic that was specifically about \"Italians\", then you better believe that De Niro was probably somewhere in there. Other than that, and the fact that it was actually produced in Italy and features an Italian-sounding score and a crew of mostly Italians, this film is about as American as pasta and pizza in New York, a location where food like that really is as American as Taco Bell, and it doesn't get any more American than that. It figures that the first time Leone submits and goes full-fleged 'Merican, we go behind his back and give his ultimate passion project a dumbed-down, radically shorter theatrical recut that was apparently so bad that it almost destroyed his faith in film. Granted, he did die five years later, so it's not like we would have missed all that much if he did quit, especially when you consider that this film takes about five years to watch, but hey, if Leone was gonna bail, then he may as well have gone out on a high note (Yeah, because all of the films he did before were so not all that good and wouldn't have given him notoriety), and make no mistake, this was the highest note he had ever hit. Still, not only did this film peak for Leone, in terms of quality, but it also peaked for him, in terms of runtime, because this was by far his longest film, and boy, does he not let you forget.\r\n\r\nThe film's slow spots are inexplicably quite less tedious than the slow spots in Leone's own similarly titled \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", and the reason why that's so inexplicable is because, although this film isn't as dull as \"In the West\", there are many points where the film is just as do-nothing and quiet as \"In the West\", and it doesn't get much more do-nothing and quiet than that. The reason why this film is considerably less dull might very well be because it, while over an hour longer, or over 100 minutes longer, in the case of the newly rediscovered \"Redux\" (Those poor movie buffs trapped watching the screening of a movie this slow for four-and-a-half hours at Cannes), is more justified in its mammoth runtime. Still, just because this film's runtime feels more fitting than the runtime on \"In the West\", that doesn't mean that the sprawling runtime is completely justified, as the film, much like \"In the West\", finds itself padded by many a gratuitously overlong period of total nothingness, as well as much repetition during actual moments of substance. To make matters worse, the film's focus, as well as its storytelling themes, seem inconsistent, for there are many layers to this tale, yet the transitions between those layers feel hurried and a smidge inorganic, partially because of the film's bumpy jumps between being a surrealistically stylized meditative film to a simple steady drama drive inconsistency into the film's storytelling themes, rendering the final product often offputting in its progression and leaving steam to go dead here and there. I joke about this pretty much being Leone's compensating for his fans for not doing \"The Godfather\", but this pretty much is the Jewish (Or still Italian, I can't tell) \"Godfather\", \"The Godfadda\" (*drum snare*), only it's held back from reaching its high aspirations, due to its unfortunate thematic inconsistencies and dullness consistency. However, at the end of the day, whether it be his passion behind it or what, Leone had crafted what is, to me, quite decidedly his finest film. True, the product's full potential of greatness ultimately goes squandered by its being overambitious and much too flawed, yet you'd still be hard pressed to not be engaged by the film, even with its mammoth length, being secured in by, if nothing else, fine style.\r\n\r\nI joke about the score sounding too Italian, but if your an Italian score composer, it's gonna be hard to drop that sound, yet that doesn't make Ennio Morricone's score anymore impressive, which isn't to say that it's quite as stellar as the work he did with Leone where he really did just give up and go Italian with his music, yet it's still very sobering and graceful, with a gorgeous tune to both engage the audience and supplement the spirit of the film. The spirit of the film goes further brought to life by the lively production designs, which bring both the hustle and bustle and broadness of '20s, '30s and '60s New York with classy scope, made all the more attractive by the sweeping observations of cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli. Based on style alone, this film is engaging, yet what truly enthralls is simply the story, which may not be the most original you can find among the gangster genre, but remains layered and pumped with depth, carried by across-the-board strong performances. From the young talents who capture the thrills of adolescence and pain of early maturity, to the effectively brutal criminal performers and always worthwhile Robert De Niro and James Wood - both of whom adopt a stern, yet humanly emotional presence of layered experience, married with pain that you can neither ever get used to or forget -, the performances ring true and help in capturing the soul and depth of this epic drama, especially when they form electric chemistry between the performers, yet also remain mere supplements to the effectiveness forged from the efforts and passion of the film's true star performer: the one offscreen, Sergio Leone. Leone was never the strongest storyteller, and even here, his faults as storyteller prove detrimental to the final product's quality, yet his inspiration for this project remains palpable, for the less urgent moments of the film go riddled with a sense of human liveliness and charm, while the more intense moments go pumped with unrelenting intrigue and sometime razor-sharp tension, made all the sharper by Leone's fine taste in action being used less for spectacle and more for substance, with impactingly not-so gratuitous-feeling violence making the hit harder. Still, what remains constant about Leone atmosphere is subtle depth, which is often too subtle to the point of slowing down the film or even giving it the occasional touch of pretension, yet is more often than not winning, giving the film a somber elegance and consistent intrigue that intensifies the effectiveness aforementioned tones captured so well by Leone and gives the film emotional weight. The film is brutal and unflinching when it's not soulful and deep, and Leone, with inspiration and sobering depth, graces the film with subtlety and ever-engaging intrigue that could have made this film truly brilliant, were it's major missteps cut back, if not cut off, yet makes it an ultimately emotionally and aesthetically rewarding stands, as it stands, making it both Leone's finest accomplishment and his satisfying fond farewell.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day and, by extension, the end of the film, slowness and many a long period of nothingness, if not repetition, plagues the film about as thoroughly as its thematic and narrative focus unevenness, rendering its potential squandered, yet still delivered upon enough for the film to really hit, being charged by gripping style and a slew of strong, layered performances, teathered together by across-the-board effective chemistry, while Sergio Leone's inspired and subtley graceful execution of the grit of the subject matter, as well as the charm and rather haunting emotional depth of the human aspects does the most to carry his passion project, ultimately leaving \"The Godfadda\"-I mean, \"Once Upon a Time in America\" to stand as a deeply enjoyable and impacting epic that Leone's legendary career had justifiably been building to.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

And manages so easily to leave you mesmerized. Epic in terms of length and direction.Leone's direction is visionary as always and hypnotic and so is De Niro's acting. Jennifer Connelly looks so beautiful as a 14 year old in her debut movie. James Woods gives a career-defining performance too. Do not dare to ignore the movie only because of the length.",

            "content": "First of all, see the director's cut, because it's much more truthful to the original vision of Sergio Leone. Second of all, if you're a fan of gangster movies, this movie is a must see one. It's right up there with The Godfather trilogy in terms of sheer scope, majesty and brilliance of storytelling. And yet the movies are very different. The Godfather is more about the mafia and old crime families whereas this movie is much more from rags to riches kind of story. And it is one that has influenced its genre greatly. Scorsese's Goodfellas for example owns a lot of its basic story, style and characters to this piece.\n\nAlthough in my opinion Goodfellas tells its story a bit better. Once Upon a Time in America is told in non-chronological fashion with many early scenes getting their background and explanation near the end of the film. The director's cut is the one where this non-chronological order is maintained as it was 'fixed' for the initial release in many places. I can understand the reasoning behind that decision as the movie is kind of hard to follow unless you pay a lot of attention or are willing to watch it twice, but it really takes something away from the vision if you mess with the director's initial ideas, so see the director's cut even if it requires a bit more from you as a viewer.\n\nThat being said, the story has some ambiguity to it, which either works for you or not. For me, it kind of did. The movie has that epic feel to it, depending more on its themes, the atmosphere and the actors to relay its message of fighting your way through heavy odds, disregarding the rules of the society and making up your own rules, depending on your brothers and bowing down to no one. Classical gangster movie themes, but this film really solidifies them into their pure form.\n\nSpecial mentions should also go to the cast and the score, which were both beyond measure. Robert De Niro, Ennio Morricone, Joe Pesci, James Woods... How can you go wrong with people like that. They really took this movie and made it their own with perfectly delivered lines, atmospheric and highly memorable pieces of music and sheer talent.\n\nStill, I can't say that this movie deserves a higher grade than what I gave it. Its individual pieces are all about perfect, but the way that the story is told and the length of the film drag it down just the tiniest bit. I can respect the artistic vision behind those both aspects and I can clearly see why some regard this as their favourite movie of all time, but I personally prefer Goodfellas. It's a great movie, but not the greatest.",

A film of this magnitude has rights to be called one of the greatest masterpieces of all time, what I saw here was not a film, it was art.  Its a storytelling at its finest, acting at its top notch, and a legendary film that will likely be remembered by many as Leone's best work.  I consider this and The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly to be his best work, both were just masterpieces of cinema and I adore them.  When I saw the film it was the 229 minute version and not the stupid U.S. edited version that made it about only 2 hours, which from the critics perspective was a horrible mess of a film.  But when watching this film a memory of every single film I have ever seen went through me and I did not know why, maybe it was the length or the magic spark inside the film, but this represents cinema at the best it should be treasured until the end of time as one of the greatest films of all time.  The plot follows a group of friends who grow up to be gangsters, and the themes of trust and friendship started showing their colors, but where the film is at its best is the interactions of its characters.  This the history of crime incredible well and does it all through the eyes of David \"Noodles\" Aaronson who may not be a likable protagonist, but he is not meant to be one.  As for the cast, Robert DeNiro will always be remembered as one of cinema's greatest actors and this film is one of the many that brought him that title, he is tenseful and plays this role with such seriousnes that I got captured in his character.  As for the other cast memebers such as James Woods, Elizabeth McGovorn, or Tuesday Weld, they were all truly were perfect and all deserved awards for their performances.  Once Upon a Time in America took me back to a time in cinema where people started looking at movies in a whole new perspective, and this violent and vulgar crime film is one of the finest examples of perfect cinema and will not only go down as one of the best films of all time, but for me it will be rememebered as one of the best crime films of all time, next to other such like The Godfather trilogy, Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed.  If the runtime scares you to sit through a movie this long, I completely recommend you give it a chance, you will not be dissapointed, and you will witness one of the most haunting and lasting films you have ever imagined.",

Noodles, played by Robert De Niro and Scott Tiler (during childhood), is a simple man and a thug with one credo: you can battle the entire world but you never betray a friend. During the course of this film we experience various pieces of Noodles's life, from childhood, through young adulthood and old age. We learn what happens to his friends, his foes and the love of his life, Deborah. The time span considered is long, including Noodles's childhood shortly after the turn of the century, through the prohibition era, and finally the 1960's.The film is about relationships; the many years Noodles spends away from his friends receive only a cursory mention. The film, like life and memories, unfolds slowly and reflectively. Sergio Leone's cuts are long and each scene is beautifully amplified my Ennio Morricone's haunting score. The story is not told chronologically. Instead, the chapters of the story are slowly revealed like pieces of a great jigsaw puzzle.",

The characters are mostly nasty people, their motivations and even the consequences of their actions are frequently unclear (yes, I saw the 4 hour version), and...dear heavens, it's 4 hours long! There are individual scenes of spellbinding power, immediateness and even fantasy. The best part of the movie by far are the scenes in 1921 during which a ragtag bunch of street kids come together to form the beginnings of a partnership that will last the next 10 years. These had a real resonance, like something that might have actually happened. Once we make the skip to the 1930's, it becomes Goodfellas and we start to hate the people that the somewhat likable kids from the last era have become. Also I have a very difficult time with rape being portrayed on screen for entertainment, even if the desired reaction is repulsion. I'm just not sure how I feel about this movie as a whole. On some levels it's exceedingly well done, but when the credits rolled I thought that maybe I didn't care about any of it. It's certainly not as good as Leone's westerns, even Once Upon a Time in the West (to which it is most similar). I'm giving it a \"good\" score because the scenes that worked - the 1920's material, baby switching, the reunion with Carol - really worked.",

            "content": "New York, 1933. Tre killer cercano rabbiosamente David Aaronson detto \"Noodles\", boss del proibizionismo venuto su dal nulla. La sua donna, Eve, dice di non sapere dove si trova e viene assassinata. \"Fat\" Moe Gelly, proprietario del bar dove Noodles è di casa, non resiste alle crudeli torture a cui viene sottoposto e parla: l'uomo che cercano è alla fumeria d'oppio dei cinesi, che funge anche da teatro. Lì Noodles, sta cercando di dimenticare la morte dei suoi tre soci ed amici: \"Patsy\", \"Cockeye\" e \"Max\". Un flashback mostra la scena di un camion bruciato, casse di whisky a terra, i cadaveri dei tre gangster, di cui uno completamente carbonizzato, sotto la pioggia battente; David, confuso, osserva la strage tra la folla: è stato lui a chiamare la polizia.\n\nDue dei killer fanno irruzione nel teatro cinese, ma Noodles riesce a scappare in tempo da un'uscita secondaria, aiutato dai gestori del locale. Va al bar di Fat Moe, vi trova e uccide il terzo ganster (quello che aveva ucciso Eve), evita, però, di soccorrere il barista, per far credere ai suoi nemici che lui è fuori da tutto, ma fa in tempo a farsi dare da quest'ultimo una chiave. Essa apre una cassetta di sicurezza alla stazione dei treni, Noodles trova la cassetta: dentro c'è la valigia che si aspettava di trovare, ma invece dei soldi che lì erano custoditi, ci sono solo vecchi giornali. Rassegnato, Noodles fugge da New York.\nNoodles è tornato a New York e si trova nella stessa stazione da cui era fuggito trantacinque anni prima. Ora è vecchio e va a trovare il suo amico Fat Moe che gestisce ancora lo stesso bar. Lì i due discutono su una strana lettera ricevuta da Noodles; nella lettera il rabbino della sinagoga locale avvisa Noodles che i corpi dei suoi tre amici devono essere spostati, e lo invita a tornare per discutere della faccenda. Noodles mette al corrente Fat Moe del fatto che ha già parlato col rabbino e questi gli ha detto che la faccenda del cimitero è già stata sistemata da tempo, e che l'ultima lettera di avviso è stata spedita otto mesi prima. Fat Moe conferma la data affermando che anche la sua gli è stata spedita all'incirca in quel periodo, inoltre Noodles ha saputo dal rabbino che i corpi dei suoi amici sono stati già sistemati nel miglior cimitero da un ignoto benefattore, i due si rendono conto che c'è sotto sicuramente qualcosa di losco. Fat Moe va a dormire lasciando solo Noodles nel locale a vagare nei ricordi: uno di essi lo porta a guardare in una feritoia che dà sul magazzino.\nLa stessa feritoia. L'adolescente Noodles spia la bella Deborah, sorella di Fat Moe che vuole fare la ballerina. Sarà il grande amore della sua vita. È in questo periodo che Noodles inizia a fare la gavetta nella malavita di quartiere assieme agli amici Patsy, Cockeye, Dominic e Max, agli ordini di Bugsy, piccolo boss locale per cui eseguiva il servizio di \"sollecitare\" i pagamenti. Un giorno però Max, stanco di essere alle dipendenze del boss, lo abbandona, insieme al gruppo di ragazzi. Purtroppo Bugsy, per avvertirli, decide di picchiare a sangue Noodles e Max.\n\nPoi i ragazzi inventano un marchingegno che permette il recupero delle casse di whisky gettate in mare dai contrabbandieri all'arrivo delle motovedette della polizia. Riescono a vendere bene la loro invenzione e i cinque amici danno vita a una cassa comune depositando la metà dei loro guadagni in una cassetta di sicurezza alla stazione.\n\nIl boss Bugsy è furioso per aver perso parte della sua importanza per via della concorrenza dei ragazzi e tenta di vendicarsi uccidendoli. Durante la colluttazione tra i ragazzi e il boss, Dominic viene ucciso (mentre muore mormora \"Sono inciampato...\") e Noodles furente lo vendica massacrando a sua volta Bugsy con un coltello; due poliziotti accorrono e tutti i ragazzi fuggono, l'unico che viene arrestato è Noodles perché accecato dall'ira si era attardato per infierire sul corpo di Bugsy ed a ferire un poliziotto che aveva tentato di fermarlo. Rimarrà in prigione per dieci lunghi anni.Noodles va al cimitero, in una sontuosa cappella che il misterioso sconosciuto ha costruito per accogliere i corpi dei suoi tre amici. Da una incisione all'interno pende una chiave, il testo su questa è dedicato a Noodles, che quindi la prende. Egli non ha dimenticato il passato e intuisce immediatamente l'uso del piccolo oggetto metallico. Si reca alla stazione ferroviaria e apre una cassetta per i bagagli. Questa volta la cassetta contiene una valigia piena di soldi, e su una delle fascette di banconote c'è scritto: In pagamento del prossimo contratto.\nNoodles è uscito dal carcere dopo dieci anni di detenzione. Lo attende Max, che lo informa che in quel periodo la banda ha ingrandito le proprie attività fino a diventare proprietaria di un locale in cui si può bere nonostante il proibizionismo, inoltre i ragazzi lavorano occasionalmente per fare grossi colpi per dei boss molto importanti che garantiscono protezione. Tornato Noodles, la banda ruba una preziosa partita di diamanti da una gioielleria su commissione del potente Frankie Monaldi e del suo amico Joe; durante questo colpo Noodles violenta una delle proprietarie della gioielleria di nome Carol. Alla consegna dei diamanti a Joe, la piccola banda fredda tutti i gangster. Noodles, comprendendo di aver dichiarato guerra a Monaldi, avendo ucciso il suo amico, inscena la morte sua e dei compagni.\nNoodles si trova nel bar di Fat Moe, mentre in televisione danno la notizia di un attentato al senatore Bailey, miracolosamente scampato ad esso. Il politico infatti è coinvolto in un importante processo di corruzione per il quale sono già stati assassinati due testimoni.\nGli affari vanno bene ma Noodles non riesce ad accettare che sia Max a decidere i colpi del gruppo e a comportarsi come se fosse il boss. In questo periodo la banda ricatta il capo della polizia, Aiello. Intanto Chicken Joe, capo di una gang rivale, prende in ostaggio il Procuratore distrettuale, James Conway O'Donnell, perché unitosi a un certo Crowing, il direttore di una fabbrica che vuole scioperare. Noodles e la sua banda prendono però in ostaggio Crowing, e costringono Chicken Joe a liberare O'Donnell.\n\nIn questo periodo Noodles tenta di convincere Deborah a sposarlo, ma lei non accetta. Una sera, dopo aver saputo da lei che sarebbe partita per Hollywood, anteponendo la carriera a lui, l'uomo perde la testa e la violenta. Nel frattempo, la faccenda degli scioperi sta prendendo una brutta piega, infatti, Crowing e Chicken Joe non demordono, poiché, quando O'Donnell, tramite cabina telefonca, sta per avvertirli che viene inseguito, Chicken Joe, lo ferisce gravemente ad una gamba. Noodles e i suoi si vendicano mitragliando Chicken Joe e un sicario ma lasciando in vita, impaurito, Crowing. La banda festeggia in ospedale, dove O'Donnell è costretto a un letto.\n\nGli affari del gruppo vanno sempre meglio, oltretutto hanno anche sconfitto la gang rivale, e durante una festa al loro locale la banda incontra nuovamente Carol e questa diventa la ragazza di Max, mentre Eve (la cui morte è stata mostrata all'inizio del film), si fidanza con Noodles. Alcuni giorni dopo, il boss del proibizionismo muore e Max, divenuto il suo successore, è stanco dei soliti colpi e decide quindi di farne uno alle casseforti della Federal Reserve. Per Noodles, sostenuto da Carol, quello sarebbe un suicidio: l'unico modo per fermare Max e gli altri è quello di denunciarli e farli arrestare mentre trasportano l'ultimo carico di whisky. Noodles avverte la polizia, ma tutto finisce rovinosamente: nella sparatoria Max, Patsy e Cockeye rimangono uccisi in mezzo alla strada sotto la pioggia battente. Il nuovo boss diviene quindi Noodles.\nNoodles è invitato al party del senatore Bailey. Prima, però, riesce a rintracciare Deborah, che ora è un'artista affermata e compagna dell'uomo politico. Il senatore ha un figlio avuto dalla prima moglie morta in seguito al parto; questo si chiama David come Noodles ed è uguale a Max quand'era ragazzo. Nonostante Deborah sconsigli a Noodles di vedere il figlio del senatore che era venuto a prenderla, Noodles decide di vederlo e capisce dalla somiglianza che il senatore è in realtà il suo vecchio complice Max.\nNonostante tutto, si reca al party organizzato dal senatore Bailey. Quest'ultimo chiede a Noodles di ucciderlo per evitare di finire sotto inchiesta, ma l'uomo si rifiuta di fare una cosa del genere. Non vuole ammettere che il vecchio amico Max lo abbia tradito, abbia inscenato l'incidente facendo eliminare dalla polizia Patsy e Cockeye, sia fuggito con i soldi della valigia soffiandogli anche Deborah. Noodles è perfettamente consapevole della verità, ma preferisce credere che Max sia morto trentacinque anni prima e se ne va, abbandonando Bailey al suo destino.\n\nNoodles passa attraverso un passaggio segreto ed esce dalla villa di Bailey. Mentre cammina lungo il viale, si volta indietro allarmato dall'accensione del motore di un camion della spazzatura. A poca distanza da questo, il senatore oltrepassa il cancello dalla sua villa e si avvicina al retro, sparendo misteriosamente dietro il camion. Noodles ipotizza che si sia ucciso, gettandosi tra gli ingranaggi che triturano l'immondizia. Perplesso, Noodles guarda l'autocarro allontanarsi, mentre un corteo di auto, con a bordo giovani festanti, gli passa davanti arrivando in direzione opposta.\nNoodles, nella fumeria d'oppio, steso sul letto e inebriato dalla droga, cerca di dimenticare. E sorride, con un sorriso pacifico, largo, eterno.",

One of De Niro's best performances - and I didn't know that Jennifer Connelly was playing in these types of films when she was young. I guess her parents barred her from seeing it.\n\nThe script's good, but it's your usual atmospheric stuff that you'd expect from Leone. Nothing too fancy concerning dialogue, but always full of hearty character development that anybody can like.\n\nI can't wait for the original director's cut of this next year.

Después del adrenalínico y magistral spaghetti western Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), el maestro italiano se abocó, varios años después (1984), a realizar una mastodóntica adaptación de la novela de Harry Grey, \"The Hoods\". El resultado, fue una película de casi 4 horas de duración, filmada a la par en Nueva York y en los estudios Cine Cittá en Italia.\n\nEn las primeras escenas, vemos un fumadero de opio en donde David \"Noodles\" (Robert De Niro), se encuentra huyendo de un par de tipos. ¿Por qué? Eso lo sabremos dentro de un larguísimo flash back, que muchos críticos han considerado como un \"sueño de opio\" en el que cae Noodles. De hecho, la compleja narración involucra un flash back dentro de otro...y este dentro de otro. Sus mejores amigos han muerto, y Noodles observa sus cuerpos tendidos en la calle, custodiados por la policia. Once Upon a Time in America es una enorme historia épica sobre los inmigrantes y el mundo criminal en Nueva York, cuya mayor influencia puede rastrearse inmediatamente en The Godfather: Part II (1974).\nMás en pantallanueve.blogspot.com",

They play parts in the destiny of the characters of Noodles and Max, but they do not play that big of a role in comparison to the main four friends - Max, Noodles, Cock-eye, and Patsy. The gangster that was roughing up the Union people, the girl Noodles was with before he decided to turn in Max, they are dust in the wind in comparison to the characters we follow from childhood. The lack of development of these characters might be alarming, but once you wrap your head around it, you'll see this is not a problem with the filmmaking, it is just this epicly long film's way of making sure that you keep your interest on the people who matter in the end of Max and Noodle's lives - eachother.\n\nWith Sergio Leone directing, not one emotional stone is left unturned. It is not a case of Sergio Leone making every scene a climax, which would definitely seem to be the case if you look at things on face value, but rather it is just a case of Sergio taking his sweet ass time with these shots, scenes, and film. \n\nKnowing that, the order of said shots and scenes within the film lead to the reason why the film is, as Roger Ebert claims, \"compulsively and continuously watchable\". The amount of violence in the film might be strong for the time (nothing on the level of Pekinpah though), but there are only two or three scenes of such blood shed, and one of them is at the beginning. And unlike Tarantino or Nolan, it is not just a case of the film being out of order and it tieing togeather as a way to mess with the audience's reception of the film, rather just because the film really tries to capture the feeling of nostalgia. Elden age nostalgia. And nostalgia can conjure up good and bad feelings, and Sergio does capture that. Though there is something else about that feeling which I cannot put my finger on which might be missing from the film. \n\nOther than that, the score by Morricone is great, the cast gives great performances though James Woods is the show stealer (as well as the lovely Elizabeth McGovern), and the production values and art design are great. Nothing else I can really say beyond that. I have to simmer with the film some more. But it is still my favorite gangster film.",

This is a shockingly brutal movie, with very graphic violence and two unflinchingly realistic rape scenes that try to show the brutality of the time.\r\n\r\nThis is a really good movie with some great performances, particularly James Woods, but it's really slow pace and bold style may not be for everyone...but for me, it is worth recommending.",

His 'dollars' trilogy made Clint Eastwood an international celebrity and pointed the way to newer, grittier westerns. And My name is Nobody was both fitting tribute and subtle mockery of the genre. But for his final work he moved into another traditional American medium, the gangster film. It was largely overlooked, both because of its original three hour and forty minute runtime, and a pathetic theatrical version that cut it almost in half. This is a real shame, because Once Upon a Time in America is one of the best gangster movies I've seen, almost on par with the Godfather.\r\n\tThe film follows Noodles (Robert de Niro) a former Jewish mobster who's returned to New York after thirty-five years on the lam.  He's been drawn by a cryptic message suggesting that someone knows who he is, and what he's done. While he seeks answers and catches up with old friends in the present, flashbacks take us back to the twenties, when Noodles, his buddy Max, and a couple of friends not even out of grammar school banded together to make some money, stick it to the man, and earn a name for themselves in the underworld. The flashbacks then proceed to the thirties, as the boys established themselves as some of the bigger movers and shakers in the Lower East Side, even as Max and Noodles drifted apart, leading to the tragedy that would leave one of them dead, and another on the run.\r\n\tOnce Upon a Time in America is by turns comic, nostalgic, and poignant. It's about how a bunch of kids with lousy home lives and no real idea what they were doing rose to the top through luck, friendship, and determination. It's about a face of New York that was gone long before this movie was made, for better and for worse. It's about the price of success and how money comes between friends. And it's about guilt and regrets for past misdeeds, and trying to make amends.\r\n\tFor someone born and raised in Italy, Leone has done a superb job of recreating prohibition era Manhattan. The hustle and bustle of peddlers' carts and throngs of people, the children scurrying across rooftops and down alleys, and the cops blowing their whistles and waving their batons are all captured so perfectly that it's as if the director were working from his own memories. And even though Noodles and his friends are up to their ears in shady dealings, and even though the streets are dirty and the neighborhood cop in on the take, it somehow seems simpler, almost wholesome as the boys plot, make promises, and chase girls. Part of me wishes I could have been there.\r\n\tBut of course there's nothing wholesome about what they're doing, or what it's doing to them. Within a few years these boys have grown up to become hardened killers. There are murders, beatings, two rapes, and a scene where they nearly set a man on fire before finding out that their organization has switched sides and now he's their friend. Plus there's a death so gruesome it can only be hinted at. And most of this is before the betrayals start and everything comes crashing down. \r\n\tIn the present, most of the scenes have a melancholy air, as Noodles walks through a changed city, one that has just enough resemblance to the one he knew to bring back painful memories of choices he made, and opportunities he lost. And when the answers to his questions arrive, it only brings more heartache as we discover that the lies and betrayals ran deeper and in more directions than he knew.\r\n\tThe script is phenomenal, the production values sterling, and the acting truly exceptional. De Niro does some of the best work of his long career, bringing Noodles to life both as a young, ruthless gangster, and a tired, regretful old man. The make-up artists also deserve great accolades for their abilities to age the main characters more than thirty years. In the later scenes, de Niro looks almost exactly as he does today. And I would be remiss if I didn't praise the work of the child actors, particularly Jennifer Connelly as Deborah, Noodles childhood sweetheart.\r\n\tOnce Upon a Time in America is a film that should be seen by any fan of the genre, or the director. It's grand, complex, and deals with the full range of human desires and emotions. It's a real shame that it isn't more widely known.",

Ten years in the making, the film was originally 4 and a half hours long, due to creative difference's and distributions the European cut was 3 hours and 40 mins.\r\n\r\nThe U.S cut however was 2 hours long, the narrative was everywhere, everything made no sense, Leone was reportedly heartbroken and vow'ed never to make another film and would sadly pass away a few years later...\r\n\r\nLuckily for us IN 2012, Leone's children and the film's Original composer will collect all 4 and a half hours and have the definitive cut ready for the 2012 Cannes or Venice film festival.\r\n\r\nOnto my Review...\r\n\r\nIn essence, I find the story one i think all of us know somewhere deep in the back of our brain , Kids growing up, best of friends, get involved in organised crime, now all we do is wait for the inevitable crash.\r\n\r\nBut that would be incredibly rude of me, to those people who have watched the film know that the performances and friendship between DeNiro and Woods's character is remarkable, the Visual look of the ghetto streets are grand, rustic and BIG on scale (The camera is shot so well you'd swear you were looking from the eyes of the kids).\r\n\r\nAs well as looking extremely authentic we are told a very well ploted narrative that spans into the friends's later years, and jumps throughout the character's 60 years of living...\r\n\r\nWe begin with an old David \"Noodles\" Aaronson (Played by lengendary actor Robert DeNiro) smoking in a Chinese opium den as he reflects on his lifetime as a child and a young adult, so far we have seen that he is on the run in the present time, then almost immediately we jump to Noodle's early years, making what he can of the depression and meeting a young yet lifelong friend Max.\r\n\r\nAs we meet the gang at a young age (That are probably the most fantastic performances from child actors ever put to film), goodtimes and tragedy are always frequent, years later Noodles and Max (Now played by James Woods whose performance is Carrer-Defining) meet again and how times have changed....\r\n\r\nWhat i've just wrote in the last couple of Paragraphs doesn't even begin to go deep enough to explain what happends in the first act, and i really do not wish to tell you what happends because there is virtually no way to explain the grand scope of this film, it hardly feels like a movie, It's an Experience, One which would feel criminal if i told you.\r\n\r\nBut as i will constantly say, the casting and acting is fantastic, the Camera Work by Leone (a Man famous for his \"Dollars\" Spaghetti Western Trilogy) is flawless, and the Score for this movie is so big on scale i swear it could rival \"The Godfather\".\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict: In The Words of Roger Ebert: \"An Epic Poem of Violence and Greed\", Need we say more?",

            "content": "What's sauce for the gangster goose isn't always sauce for the gangster gander. There are a number of interesting parallels between Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather films and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America, not the least of which is the participation of Robert De Niro. But perhaps more interestingly, in the case of The Godfather Part II especially and Once Upon a Time in America, both films were \"revisited\" and reedited to make their stories chronological. In the case of Coppola's film(s), the director himself went back to the drawing board with editor Barry Malkin to make The Godfather Saga for network television, an attempt which completely changed the back and forth timelines of the second film, something that may have made the story more easily accessible, but which completely destroyed the cross referencing and international irony the original film version contained. In the case of Once Upon a Time in America, that film was wrested from director Leone's hands, even after a triumphant premiere at Cannes, and chopped to bits for its American theatrical release, once again, like The Godfather Saga, put in \"correct order\" and, perhaps unlike The Godfather saga, dealt a stultifying blow to its creators' intentions. Somehow saner hands prevailed, and after a brief run in this extremely truncated version, something approaching Leone's original vision was re-released and the film, while never attaining true blockbsuter status, has achieved a certain cult audience through the years.\r\n\r\nCoppola's epic trilogy is often termed operatic, and while that certainly can't be denied, the description is just as if not more apt for Leone's own look at immigrant criminal element becoming assimilated in the United States. The different here is largely one of pace. Both films features grandiose emotions and plot points, hyperbolic interactions and bursts of extreme violence. What sets Leone's Once Upon a Time in America so far apart from some of its gangster film kin is its deliberate, some might argue lugurbrious, tempo, which no doubt contributed to the hack job it suffered in its early release. For anyone who has seen the recent semi-homage to Leone, Anton Corbijn's The American, you know how vigorously that films works against its genre stereotypes to almost willfully defy categorization, as indeed Leone's own \"Spaghetti westerns\" did a generation previously. Perhaps to a slightly lesser extent, Leone's American opus wants to reach beyond the confines of the traditonal gangster epic to make larger points about loyalty, friendship and shifting motivations, while at the same time utilizing a lot of the time honored cliches of the gangster idiom. Does it always succeed? No. Is it an often riveting experience nonetheless? Undoubtedly.\r\n\r\nRobert De Niro portrays David \"Noodles\" Aaronson, a Jewish kid from, yes, you guessed it, the wrong side of the tracks who is incarcerated at an early age, and then released in the early 1930's just as bootlegging and Prohibition are in full swing. Noodles' main gangster buddy is Max (James Woods), along with his some of his childhood compadres. The film utilizes the same ping-ponging time traveling technique that made Coppola's original cut of The Godfather II so evocative. Here, we bounce back and forth between Noodles' 1930's escapades and a late 1960's timeframe which sees the gangster caught up in a labyrinth of assumed identities and a long, yes, you guessed it, operatic series of events which ties together several strands of the friendship story between Noodles and Max from the 1930's time period. Also in the mix is an earlier period from Noodles' childhood. All three ages play off of each other and inform each other in often unexpected ways throughout the film.\r\n\r\nBut Once Upon a Time in America is not a film where a sequential precis does the project any justice. Like any good magician, Leone is such a master of misdirection (no pun intended) that large swaths of Once Upon a Time in America play out like a fevered dream, and in fact critic Richard Schickel is on record, including on his commentary track, that he feels great portions of the film are meant to be an opium induced hallucination. What is so striking about Once Upon a Time in America is how little the audience is let in on what is actually happening through whole segments and sequences. What is up with the phone that won't stop ringing, a relentless brothersome instrustion through several timeframes in the film's opening gambit? What does Noodles see in the briefcase he finds spirited away in the early 1930's? What do the three bodies lying in a street, evidently part of some sort of gang hit and resultant car crash, have to do with the various plot points that are oh, so slowly being revealed throughout the film's almost four hour running length? This is a film that absolutely requires patience on the part of the viewer, and if audiences weren't exactly prepared for something this labyrinthine back in 1984 when it was originally released, one can only wonder what the reaction will be from today's ADHD set. This is a film which virtually requires repeat viewings to completely comprehend its intricate structure and self-referencing.\r\n\r\nBut for those who stick with this film, and indeed grant it a second viewing shortly after a first, Once Upon a Time in America is like one of those old stacking Chinese doll sets, where each uncovering leads to another secret, which itself is dismembered to reveal yet another layer. This onion-peeling technique is a radical invention of Leone's, and it's all the more impressive as he utilizes it while playing three disparate time periods off of each other. Even the prime periods themselves are plastic, inchoate devices; Noodles will start a movement in one time period and finish it in another. The audience is left to sort things out moment by moment. The film almost plays like one of the old Warner gangster epics, the kind where two childhood friends grow up with different \"career\" trajectories, filtered through an almost surreal leans of memory and nostalgia, coupled with the resignation and cynicism brought on by encroaching age.\r\n\r\nAnyone wanting a doctoral level thesis in the art of filmmaking, mise en scene and an Eisenteinian stratum example of montage theory will have a field day with Once Upon a Time in America. Dense, often opaque, and about as discursive as any supposedly narrative driven film of the past 50 years has ever been, patience is required to fully fathom what Leone is getting at with this piece. Don't be frightened by these comments, as Once Upon a Time in America is a surpisingly brisk experience, especially considering it weighs in at almost four hours. De Niro, Woods and the entire supporting ensemble (including such stalwarts as Burt Young, Tuesday Weld, Elizabeth McGovern, a very young Jennifer Connelly and Treat Williams) are so impeccably cast that even (at least on first viewing) when confusion momentarily reigns in the mid of the viewer, there's such compelling action most of the time that it's easy to move ahead and go with the flow of the film's overall momentum.\r\n\r\nA lot (and I mean a lot) has been written and otherwise postulated about Leone's choice for the film's closing moments. Is it indeed an indication that much of what we've seen is an opium induced vision? Is it, as Schickel avers, a \"pre-cognitive\" event in Noodles' own mind? Or is it simply the final, fleeting elegy of a soul attempting to find one moment of remembered peace in an otherwise tumultuous life, albeit a moment made peaceful by the numbing effects of a drug? There are no easy answers to this question, and it's obvious that Leone mean for the viewer to wrestle with that difficult ambiguity. In fact this is an unusually challenging peice in an idiom that often prides itself on the passivity of the viewer. Once Upon a Time in America requires actual thought and an unusual amount of attention to be paid, but if it's approached with the respect it deserves, this is one of the most involving and nuanced films of Leone's storied career.\r\n\r\nSergio Leone's films constantly defy expectation and the tropes their supposed genres dictate. Once Upon a Time in America is one of the director's grandest achievements, a novelistic and operatic approach to the gangster idiom that demands that the audience stay on their collective toes to follow a story that reveals its secrets in dribs and drabs over the course of almost four hours. De Niro and Woods make a towering pair in this feature, but the real star here is Leone, a director at the absolute height of his inestimable powers.",

They both explore the theme loyalty, and portray characters testing their loyalties to each other in the midst of tension regarding business. However, other than that, they really don't have much in common.\r\n\r\nWhile The Godfather, and many other gangster films, explores the inside of a crime organization, Once Upon A Time In America is more of an emotionally driven film. The characters in this film are not defined by their actions. We don't really look at them as gangsters. Instead, we see them as young men who've grown up a tough life together, and have bonded through their experiences. \r\n\t\r\nIn case you don't know what it's about, the film is a show the lives of four Jewish boys and their rise in the New York mafia. It's not always clear what their involvement is, but like I said, that's beside the point. We follow them from their youth in the 1920's, to their young adult years, when three of them are killed. That's not a spoiler by the way. Those details are known from the beginning.  We follow the one who survives (Robert De Niro) all the way to the 1960's. \r\n\t\r\nThroughout the film, the men do some horrible actions. Normally it would be hard to care for these characters, but because we understand where they come from and understand the bond they share, we can have some sympathy for them. The scenes that show the men in their teens are some of the best moments in the movie, and the child actors give some of the best child performances I've ever seen. \r\n\t\r\nThis isn't the most incredible performance by De Niro, but he gives the movie everything it needed. Honestly, as much a good performance is important to a movie, this one is so well made that I think it would appeal to our emotions regardless of the performance. Still, it's always great when a movie has an actor as amazing as Robert De Niro. James Woods is also great by the way.\r\n\t\r\nDon't be intimidated by the almost 4 hour running time. Thanks to the beautiful direction of Sergio Leone, this film flows right by, and even leaves you wanting more. There are even something I wish they had explored even more, such as the relationship between James Woods character and his girlfriend. I don't mean to criticize the film for that though. After all, Leone originally wanted to release this  film in two three-hour parts, so he's obviously not to blame.\r\n\t\r\nAs far as ranking the best Gangster films, I think I could think of a handful of films to put ahead of this one. However, this may be one of the most emotionally haunting and powerful films ever made.",

            "content": "For being Segio Leone's last production before he died in 1989, he certainly knew how to go out with a bang. It's one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen, though it might go unrecognized today. It's without a doubt, a masterpiece, in every sense of the word. It's beautiful narrative, along with it's wonderful acting, and amazing musical composition blend together to provide the audience with a intense, yet touching story of friendship, betrayal, and above all else, honor. \n\nIt's not often that you get to see movies about Jewish gangsters. This film and \"Bugsy\" are probably the best ones out there. It's sort of an untold story, and that's what makes it so wonderful. Everyone's done Italian mafia, but this is a place where not many directors go, so already there was a lot of room for Leone to work with. I've heard that he had approximately 10 hours of footage after he filmed everything, and he wanted to cut the film down to 6 hours, putting the movie into two parts. But the studio didn't allow him to do that. Though Leone didn't convey his story to the viewers exactly like he wanted to, it's alright, because what he does show the audience, is phenomenal. The film goes through the life of the friends from when they are just kids to when they are full-grown adults. Like I said, it's really one of the most impressive narratives I've seen. Everything comes full circle, and when you look back at the progression of the characters as the film narrows down to it's final minutes, you'll find yourself tearing up at it's beauty. \n\nThe performances are phenomenal, as expected. From the child actors playing the kids at a young age, to the amazing talent of De Niro and Woods, everything is perfect, and spot on. Robert De Niro, is flawless. He packs a lot of emotion into his performance, and you can tell that he's very devoted to what's going on. James Woods was particularly amazing. I thought that he was astounding in this one, and the connection that he sends is fantastic. There was just something about him that I loved. All around, the performances gave this amazing attitude and emotion to the viewer. Fantastic Fantastic....fantastic. \n\nEnnio Morricone.....is a god in this film. He provides one of the most brilliant soundtracks I have ever listened to. The main theme of the movie is beautiful...combining brilliant flutes with orchestral compositions, pianos, and guitars. It was amazing. This is the component that truly makes you get goose bumps during this entire movie. In my opinion, if Morricone didn't do the soundtrack, it would have been a completely different movie. Through the film's almost 4 hour span, he provides a sound that almost can't be matched. I commend him, and bow down to him. The soundtrack itself made me cry. He's brilliant, in every way. \n\nLeone provides beautiful landscapes, varying from different places, and different time periods, and also uses his classic zoom ups, that he does in every one of his films. He uses cinematography that always focuses on the character's personal emotions and thoughts. He's always had a talent for doing that, and he always lets the cinematographer know exactly what his style is, and what he wants. Genius. \n\n\"Once Upon a Time in America\" is without a doubt one of his best films, and one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's such a shame that really no one pays attention to this movie, because it's like I said, a masterpiece. Sergio Leone went all out with this production, and with all of the footage that he captured, battling for a two part movie, you could tell how devoted he was. This film itself represents how much of master he was at the art of cinema. He is the ideal director for any film that wants to capture a story and convey it through beautiful acting, cinematography, and of course, music. He was one of the best, and this is one of the best. See this movie...because...it's perfect.",

            "content": "If I had to pick one crime film that could come anywhere near the masterpiece status of The Godfather films, it would be this movie. It has the same sweeping epic structure, the same well defined characters, the same beautiful period look of New York City, a haunting beautiful music score by Ennio Morricone, and a story line that is written in meticulous detail. It does not match The Godfather as one of the greatest films of all time but it leaves an extremely large footprint in the sand. It is a dramatic crime saga based on the book, The Hoods by Harry Grey that takes the actors and the viewers from the 1920s to the late 1960s in America.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay was written and directed from the book by Sergio Leone, the man who made Clint Eastwood a star in those Spaghetti Westerns such as A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. This film stars Robert DeNiro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Danny Aiello, Treat Williams, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Larry Rapp, and a half dozen child actors who play some of these actors in their youth.\r\n\r\nThe original movie as filmed by Leone is almost four hours long and it won critical acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival in 1984. It's a very long movie filled with many sometimes confusing flashbacks but it doesn't seem that long at the first viewing because it draws you in immediately so that you almost feel that you are side by side with the characters on the screen. It is much slower paced than The Godfather but each scene moves the film foreword until you feel as though you are actually growing up with the people you are watching. Leone's photographic style was to take his time and linger a long time on each scene which gives the illusion to the viewer that the action is taking place for the first time, right now, in real time.\r\n\r\nThis technique also allows the audience to identify and bond with the characters and the unfolding events in which they become involved. Unfortunately, when the movie was released in the United States, it was deemed too long by the The Ladd Company who then reedited and shortened it by about ninety minutes which literally cut the heart and soul out of the film.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the movie never was successful here as it was in Europe and it has become a lost overlooked gem for many who probably have never even heard of it. If you decide to rent this film (and you should), make sure you get the long four hour version only and not the shorter one. Also please be advised that there are many graphic sexual scenes here (including rape) and also explicit violence which may make some people uneasy. Much of this is done to advance the story and is accomplished, as much as possible, with class and with an operatic style.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is one of DeNiro's best performances of his career because his character is about twenty five at the beginning and then ages to around sixty five toward the end. At the older age, with very little make up and just his grayed hairline shaved back, he walks, talks, and looks like a man who is sixty five years old. It is astonishing to watch this magnificent transformation and part of the credit for this metamorphosis must go to the director. This is also a major role for James Woods and he gives his best ever acting performance here holding his own very easily against the exceptional talent of DeNiro.\r\n\r\nThe film begins in 1933 when Italian mobsters are looking for Noodles (DeNiro) who they feel was responsible for the failure of one or their bootlegging operations by his informing the police of their plans in advance. Noodles is smoking opium in a Chinese den when they arrive there and he barely makes his escape from them. He goes back to his home base at his gang's bar where one of the mobsters is stationed waiting for him to arrive but he manages to escape there also. Now a hunted man, he buys a one way bus ticket to Buffalo where he spends the rest of his life in hiding, until one day a letter arrives which forces him back to New York City. He comes back to the same bus station about thirty years later as an old man ready to finally solve the puzzle as to what actually happened that day when he was forced to flee.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrives at the bar in his old neighborhood, he reunites with the owner and old childhood friend, Fat Moe (Larry Rapp) who puts him up for the night. Noodles roams around the closed bar and begins to reminisce about his childhood days and the movie flashes back to the early 1920s with adolescent actors playing their adult counterparts as sixteen year old kids growing up in the Jewish ghettos of Brooklyn. Leone affords plenty of time to develop these young Jewish characters and with the ambiance of the early city sights along with the beautiful haunting music of that time, these scenes spring alive before your eyes.\r\n\r\nThe kids are street smart as they cope with the struggling city life and soon start their own gang and get involved with young rival gangs all of whom are trying to make a lot of money illegally any way they can. David \"Noodles\" Aaronson (Scott Tiler) and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovitz (Rusty Jacobs) are the co-leaders of the gang and do not always see things eye to eye. Max is the more cunning of the two and also more ambitious while Noodles is the more romantic and easy going type. Eventually, though, Noodles is forced to kill a gangster in revenge and is apprehended by policemen whereupon he is sent to prison.\r\nWhen Noodles is released eleven years later, his role is taken over by DeNiro and he is met by his longtime friend, Max, now played by James Woods as an adult. The gang has prospered over the years during Prohibition and now they welcome their old friend, Noodles, back home as an equal partner.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish mobsters go on to great success until Prohibition ends and their income begins to dry up. Max wants the gang to join up with the Italian Mafia but Noodles insists that they remain independent. The two leaders continue to have divergent opinions as to how to proceed and they argue constantly.\r\n\r\nThis sets up a dilemma between the longtime friends until Max decides to solve the problem by betraying Noodles in an elaborate scheme. He tells Noodles that he wants to rob the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which is an impossible task. He becomes so insistent that he sets up a situation where Noodles feels that he must inform on his gang's next activity thinking that Max will be sent to prison for a short time which would then make him forget his plan to rob the bank. He plans on also being caught and sent to prison with his friend but things don't work out that way.\r\n\r\nTHE BOTTOM LINE?\r\n\r\nThis movie is far too involved and complex to go into much more detail here and telling more will spoil the enjoyment for the viewer. There are many underlying plots including a poignant love story between Noodles and Deborah Gelly (Elizabeth McGovern) which permeates throughout the film. There are also confrontations with rival gangster Frankie Minaldi (Joe Pesci), the Chief of Police (Danny Aiello) and a union boss (Treat Williams) whom they need to supply them with union money.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that there are many explicit graphic sexual scenes here which are part of the story of growing up and every day happenings in the underworld. There is also extreme graphic violence between mobsters to contend with so please do not watch this movie with your mother or your grandmother.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the film, you will probably have many questions. You can post them here and I will answer them or you can watch parts of the movie again. One thing is for sure that if you enjoy excellence in both movie making and storytelling, you must see this film. You must choose a night that you have nothing to do for four hours; then sit back in your favorite easy chair making sure you keep your cell phone in another room; then crack open a bottle of Sam Adams Lager Beer and be prepared to enter a vivid world that really did exist once upon a time in America!\r\n\r\nFrom the Aisle Seat at the Movies\r\nhttp://moxieandcharisma.wordpress.com",

I have heard so many great things about this movie so I thought this movie was going to be extraordinary.  Believe me I did enjoy it but I think the length made me bored at points.  I am not saying that this is a boring movie because trust me it definitely is not.  But I don't think it needed to be that long(almost 4 hours).  If the length was cut a bit, then I would probably have given this 100%.  I completely see why this is a classic.  The actors did and extraordinary job, James Wood and Robert De Niro were great together!  But yeah I personally think the length should not have been that long, and then I think it would have been the perfect movie.  It was still a great movie and I did enjoy most of it.",

With the great help of Robert De Niro, Leone makes one of the best Gangster films of all-time, only losing with the first 2 Godfathers, Goodfellas and probably a few that I'm forgetting right now.  Although the film is very long (almost 4 hours), it is a pleasure to watch the whole thing, something that doesn't happen with other good films like Lawrence Of Arabia and others (I mean, they're great films but you get to feel a bit lazy to watch it without intermissions).  Definitely one of the best films of the 80s and probably of cinema's history.",

I've been watching such brilliant films lately that this film just seems below them. DeNiro in top form as the Jewish gangster with possibly the lamest gangster nickname I've ever heard.  I'm used to names like Stringer Bell, Jimmy the Gent, Winston \"The Wolf\", and here we get a guy named... \"Noodles\".  How scary!  Anyway, the film is a 4 epic that requires an entire afternoon, so be warned.",

There were way too many loose ends and plot holes â\" which is pretty astonishing for its length.  Iâ(TM)m a little surprised that I could say that a nearly four hour movie with almost no dialogue was good OR incomplete, but it was both.  DeNiro carries this one all the way.  If you were in love with The Godfather II, youâ(TM)ll like this one.  If not, no promises.  I may have liked this movie, but Leone (director) at one point asks us to cheer for a rapist.  I think that may have been a deal breaker.  This one is ultimately a mixed bag.  (P.S.  Three cheers for the cupcake scene)",
