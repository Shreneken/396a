            "content": "Unpopular opinion, I know. This movie talks about a topic that completely justifies something I absolutely hate. You've seen those reviews where people trash a movie or a series because their religious sentiments got offended? Yeah, consider the same thing has happened to me over here.\n\nI really like Ayushmann Khurrana. He's always the best artiste for me. I am such a simp for him that I can watch him all day. And he doesn't disappoint here either. This movie taught me the meaning of sarbala (the kid who sits on the horse next to the groom in a marriage, just in case you forgot). All the comic scenes were absolutely hilarious. The acting was also phenomenal. I would have given this movie 5/5, if I weren't offended.\n\nSo the message about this movie is what exactly? Accept overpopulation and let the world suffer because we are the good guys? Or is it have kids just before menopause? Or is it that abortion is evil? Either way it's not a good message. The only message I could have accepted in this movie was that someone should not be harassed over a choice they made, but that message was never given and so I won't even consider this is what the director wanted to tell.\n\nTrust me, I'm not like one of \"those\" people, who would write hate speeches about some film online and give death threats to the actors. If that were true I would have given it a 1 star review and written abuses instead of a long review like this. But this movie gives the wrong message to the society and it should not be taken seriously. Also apart from that the cinematography wasn't good so that brings down another star (originally I was gonna give it 3).",

Most of it is predictable, but I never had as much fun, I never laughed as much hard in any film as I did watching this one. Amit Sharma, the infamous filmmaker of 'Tevar' has elevated the storytelling so much that the characters and scenes will truly stay in your mind even after years watching the film. It's surely a film which pinpoints the stereotypes and social, sexual stigmas hilariously. It's an enjoyable love story with effective writing, and always worth a revisit.",

            "content": "\"Badhaai Ho\" is a movie with a simple premise that is both funny and heartfelt. What I liked most about this movie is the important message it presents. I feel the movie balances comedy and drama well, but the movie rarely made me laugh out loud, aside from maybe a couple jokes. I also felt the movie wasn't always that entertaining from time to time because it felt like not a lot was happening in the story. However, the movie kept a smile on my face throughout and I enjoyed it for the lighthearted and fun movie it was aiming to be. Its strong message about focusing on your family and not caring about what others think makes the movie worthwhile.",

Kudos to it Amit Sharma.\n\nActing me kisi bhi actor ne koi kasar nahi chhodi he. I belive the CD, Jogi Malang, deserve a huge lot of credits.\nBut, exceptional mention mein hain Surekha Sikri, jinhone dadi ka role nibhaya hai. Ek character khada kiya hai jise kai saalon tak log nahi bhul payenge. I am sure youtube pe is dadi ke comedy scenes ko millions watch milne mein jada time nahi lagega.\n\nSo guys, must must watch Badhao Ho!",
