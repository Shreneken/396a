The importance of having love or a relationship in a person's life and when once found, how it transforms his life in many ways is appropriately shown in Farhan Akhtar's directorial debut 'Dil Chahta Hai'. This movie is relatable to everyone whether you believe in love or not, it will hit you directly in the heart. The emotions of the characters are enhanced by the brilliant performances by all the lead actors and the spectacular music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. It is different from all the romantic movies made in Bollywood. It's realistic, relatable and certainly refreshed the romantic genre in Bollywood. Dil Chahta Hai is highly recommended if you have not seen it yet. No matter how many times you watch this movie the emotions that you will feel while watching it will still remain the same. It can be considered among one of the best movies of all time.",

I just really felt the fight between Sid and Akash was too simple to cause such a riff and therefore one of the biggest drama's didn't pull me in. Nor did the relationship between Tara and Sid so it lost me at the most important parts. As for Sameer...his relationships were very much of the \"dog-humping-leg\" variety so I took nothing he did very seriously. I guess they might have just picked too many storylines and as a result didn't develop them enough for me. \nnot a terrible movie but not something I'll be rushing to rewatch. Nor music that really grabbed me. I like the saying though, \"Dil Chahta Hai\" :)",

            "content": "Dil Chahta Hai\" is cult, so I'm sure that most (or maybe even all) of you have already seen it, and those who haven't (like me, until yesterday), ought to catch up as soon as possible. So much for that.\r\nAs you can read out of the plot description, we're not fed a new story, but that can, as is generally known, also be lovely - provided that the whole thing is freshened up a little. Be it via new perspectives, eminently good actors, a great soundtrack... or a little bit of everything. That's probably what Farhan Akhtar, who debuted as a director with this one, thought too, when he puzzled out what became one of the most known Bollywood films nowadays. (By the by, I'm a big appreciator of Farhan Akhtar's work and happy to have seen all of his scheduled work by now).\r\nThe result, which may celebrate its 10st birthday this year, can be seen, and is now as then surrounded by some fresh air, to which, among other things, the great actors contribute. Many of them are high-profiled performers today. Aamir Khan, who in the same year tightened his position in Bollywood by means of Laagan, gave one of his best shots again. Accustomed down-to-earth, but not boring, he plays the buffoon Akash, and in some scenes almost eclipses his colleagues Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna. Still, those two are in full cry in \"Dil Chahta Hai\". While Saif has been somewhat disappointing with his choice of films in the last past years, he doesn't leave anything to be desired in what's often dealt as his big break. He's the perfect cast for the charming womanizer Samir, in spite of some dubiously fashionable outfits. The third party is Akshaye, who gives one of his best performances here. Though he, just like Aamir, is no \"classic beauty\", he's very well able to inspire as the gentle artist Sid, and soon catches the sympathy of the audience. His love to an older woman appears to be cordial and honest and is one of the best ideas of the writers. There are still to many films with old men and young women, that don't even question the age difference, and not enough with an opposite constellation. Dimple Kapadia plays Tara and I really liked her in this role - she has a calm aura, through which you can slightly see her insecurity and sadness. I also believe that Tara, in her very heart, loved Sid, but didn't feel she had enough power to listen to it and break the traditions. Sonali Kulkarni, who plays Samir's big love Pooja, isn't really worth mentioning, as her role is rather exchangeable and unimportant. And finally, there's Preity Zinta, my favorite actress, who sadly isn't very present in these days. As always, she is, in face of an unthankful hair styling, enchanting and fully fills out her role. She also makes a cute couple with Aamir, in some scenes, a concentrated passion springs up between the two of them; I'm talking about the famous metro scene, where the door shuts between Akash and Shalini... For one moment, their expressions change and the feelings are at once as touchable as the door between them. That's something I call real acting talent, and I was just captured by that scene... The two are convincing all through the film, and I still wonder how they succeeded in making that opera scene not seem kitschy.\r\nAnother great \"couple\" is the threesome of Aamir, Saif and Akshaye. The three boys'/ men's friendship is convincing and realistic (apart from the fact that a tiny comment destroys the friendship for such a long time, but we'll save that under dramaturgic freedom). This whole wonderful and interesting story (which, buy the way, doesn't get boring though its three hours), is also backed up by great locations, a fresh soundtrack and well done filming. Sydney, Goa and Bombay are portrayed beautifully, but in a realistic way, by Ravi K. Chandran. The soundtrack by S-E-L is youthful and stays in your head, and it enhances the story instead of unnecessarily deviating from it. \r\nI could go on praising this film, but I think it's enough for today. \"Dil Chahta Hai\" lives up to its promise: It's an ode to friendship, with all its highs and lows, and a remembrance, that there's a soulmate for everyone. All of that may sound really kitschy to you, but it's been permuted resourcefully and hence remains a true milestone of Bollywood - a must-see.\r\n9/10\r\n\r\nhttp://limereviews.blogspot.com",

He thinks the concept of love is created to ruin perfectly healthy relationships.\n\nSameer is a believer. He wants to be in love. He loves being in love. Unfortunately for him, he hasn't quite grasped the concept of it just yet. Wearing his heart on his sleeve, he is out there persevering, believing that he will find that 'special her', as long as he keeps searching.\n\nSiddharth is mature, sensitive and understanding. Siddharth aka Sid knows the true meaning of the word \ufffd love. He feels it everyday, every hour, every minute. For his friends, his acquaintances, for the stray dog living outside his gate, for the tree that's just been planted next door. He has reached modern day enlightenment.\n\nDIL CHAHTA HAI is a film about these three distinct characters, their individual relationships and the effect that those relationships have on the three of them.\n\nYou expect the moon from DIL CHAHTA HAI as far as entertainment goes and there are three vital reasons behind it:\n\nOne, the film stars some of the best names in the business, who have been accredited for their acting prowess.\n\n[url=\"http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3DDil%2BChahta%2BHai%26ei%3DUTF-8%26fr%3Dyfp-t-501%26fp_ip%3DCA%26x%3Dwrt%26js%3D1%26ni%3D20&w=300&h=290&imgurl=www.lovehkfilm.com%2Fpanasia%2Faj6293%2Fdil_chahta_hai.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehkfilm.com%2Fpanasia%2Faj6293&size=19.7kB&name=dil_chahta_hai.jpg&p=Dil+Chahta+Hai&type=jpeg&no=14&tt=1,228&oid=bdc2112232afba68&ei=UTF-8\"][img]http://re3.mm-a1.yimg.com/image/2065332798[/img][/url] Two, the film marks the debut of Farhan Akhtar, son of Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani, two accomplished writers.\n\nThree, the promotion of the film and the hype it has generated makes it a keenly anticipated film.\n\nSo does DIL CHAHTA HAI meet the high expectations? Yes and no!\n\nLet's begin with the uppers\ufffd\n\n* The storyline is diverse from the run-of-the-mill fares we've been subjected to since time immemorial.\n\n* The performances of the three lead stars are marvellous. More about this later.\n\n* The music (Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) is refreshingly different. The makers have experimented with a new sound and it works.\n\n[url=\"http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3DDil%2BChahta%2BHai%26ei%3DUTF-8%26fp_ip%3DCA%26js%3D1%26ni%3D20%26fr%3Dyfp-t-501%26b%3D41&w=147&h=156&imgurl=cinemaa.indya.com%2Fimages%2Fdch1.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcinemaa.indya.com%2Freviews%2Fdch.html&size=5.2kB&name=dch1.jpg&p=Dil+Chahta+Hai&type=jpeg&no=46&tt=1,228&oid=df4c852ed9d98a92&ei=UTF-8\"][img]http://re3.mm-a6.yimg.com/image/3546535264[/img][/url] * The initial reels are full of light moments and keep the viewer in splits with witty one-liners. \n\n* The look of the film deserves special mention. Technically too, the product is first-rate.\n\nNow the downers\ufffd\n\n* The biggest flaw of the film is that it has been treated like an English film. To be honest, it is too western for the Indian masses to digest. Moreover, in the post-interval portions, the story moves on three different tracks, which are alien to each other.\n\n* The second drawback is the length and the pace of the film. The story has been stretched excessively in the second half and what adds to the problems is the lethargic pace of the narration.\n\n* Besides the above-mentioned flaws, the film suffers in the scripting department. The storyline is new, but it has its limitations. It might appeal to a select few in metros; universal acceptance is ruled out.\n\n* The story just doesn't budge in the first half. Actually, the director has concentrated more on incidents/individual sequences to move the narration ahead. The story actually gains momentum at the interval point.\n\nEven otherwise, there are portions where you feel that the script should've been coherent. To cite instances:\n\n[url=\"http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Ddil%2Bchahta%2Bhai%2Bmovie%26ei%3DUTF-8%26fp_ip%3DCA%26js%3D1%26ni%3D20%26fr%3Dyfp-t-501%26b%3D41&w=135&h=115&imgurl=in.rediff.com%2Fmovies%2F2001%2Fjul%2F31bol6.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fin.rediff.com%2Fmovies%2F2001%2Fjul%2F31bol.htm&size=6.5kB&name=31bol6.jpg&p=dil+chahta+hai+movie&type=jpeg&no=49&tt=122&oid=1a536118a3eb0c72&ei=UTF-8\"][img]http://re3.mm-a2.yimg.com/image/2314150472[/img][/url] From the word 'go', Aamir is projected to be gregarious by nature, but the time he takes to come to terms with the fact that he has indeed fallen in love and the time he takes to convey his feelings to Preity Zinta, contradicts his basic nature.\n\nAkshaye is shown falling in love with a woman elder to him, which may appeal to the elite only. \n\nAs a director, Farhan Akhtar makes a brilliant debut. The light sequences in the first half or the interval point when Akshaye slaps Aamir and even some emotional moments in the second half have been shot remarkably.\n\nBut as the script writer, he should've known that presenting an English film in the garb of a Hindi film may not catch the fancy of an average Indian cinegoer. The film has an urban look and feel to it and only a faction of cinegoers would take to this kind of a script.\n\nShankar-Ehsan-Loy's music is pleasing to the ears. What uplifts the score is the picturisation of the songs (Farah Khan), which gels well with the mood of the film. The pick of the lot are 'Koi Kahe Kehta Rahe', 'Jaane Kyon Log Pyaar Karte Hain' and the title track. 'Tanhai' is a gem lyrically and even its picturisation is noteworthy.\n\n[url=\"http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Ddil%2Bchahta%2Bhai%2Bmovie%2Bstills%26ei%3DUTF-8%26fr%3Dyfp-t-501%26fp_ip%3DCA%26x%3Dwrt%26js%3D1%26ni%3D20&w=184&h=200&imgurl=www.surfbollywood.com%2Fcacheimg%2F___Movie_Stills__1157126326.200x200.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.surfbollywood.com%2Fimgbrowser.pl%3FCAT%3DBollywood%26amp%3BGENRE%3DMovie%2BStills%26amp%3BMOVIE%3DDil%2BChahta%2BHai%26amp%3BVIEW%3DALBUM&size=15.8kB&name=___Movie_Stills__1157126326.200x200.jpg&p=dil+chahta+hai+movie+stills&type=jpeg&no=2&tt=9&oid=29b5d2de336554c2&ei=UTF-8\"][img]http://re3.mm-a4.yimg.com/image/2940214247[/img][/url] Ravi Chandran's cinematography deserves the highest marks. The locales of Sydney and Goa have been shot to perfection. Dialogues are witty, funny and heart-rending.\n\nDIL CHAHTA HAI is a landmark film for Aamir Khan, who proves his supremacy yet again. The actor goes through this difficult role with precision and bolsters the fact that he is the best actor amongst the current lot.\n\nSaif Ali Khan delivers his career-best performance. His scenes with his girl-friend (Suchitra Pillai) in the initial reels and later with Sonali Kulkarni's fianc?re hilarious. Not once do you feel that Saif is overawed by the presence of two powerful actors, for his work is excellent.\n\nAkshaye Khanna conveys a lot through his expressions and that's where he triumphs. An actor par excellence, Akshaye essays this complex character with flourish. The scene with Aamir at the interval point indicates that the guy is amongst the best performers we have today.\n\nPreity Zinta looks hep and emotes with utmost conviction, showing a marked improvement over her previous performances. Sonali Kulkarni is wasted in an insignificant role. Dimple Kapadia is just about okay. Ayub Khan gives a good account of himself. Suhasini Mulay, as Akshaye's mother, is natural.\n\nOn the whole, DIL CHAHTA HAI will find patronage and flavour from the youth in Mumbai city and Overseas (in the U.S. and U.K. mainly!), but the film will find the going tough elsewhere in India. \n\n[img]http://www.indiafm.com/templates/default/images/movies/rating_red.gif[/img][img]http://www.indiafm.com/templates/default/images/movies/rating_red.gif[/img][img]http://www.indiafm.com/templates/default/images/movies/rating_red.gif[/img][img]http://www.indiafm.com/templates/default/images/movies/rating_red.gif[/img][img]http://www.indiafm.com/templates/default/images/movies/rating_red.gif[/img][img]http://www.indiafm.com/templates/default/images/movies/rating_red.gif[/img][img]http://www.indiafm.com/templates/default/images/movies/rating_red.gif[/img][img]http://www.indiafm.com/templates/default/images/movies/rating_half.gif[/img][img]http://www.indiafm.com/templates/default/images/movies/rating_grey.gif[/img][img]http://www.indiafm.com/templates/default/images/movies/rating_grey.gif[/img]",

            "content": "After Ghajini and Taare Zameen Par, I have been backtracking and have started to watch all of Aamir Khan's movies.  And I chanced upon this great treasure - starring all the current superstars of Bollywood i.e. Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna and Preity Zinta (she's my favorite Bollywood actress... so pretty and she looks more Chinese than Indian!).\n\nThis is a story about the lives and loves of 3 recently graduated university guys who hail from affluent backgrounds.\n\nAamir Khan is Akash - a young rich spoilt playboy who doesnt believe in keeping a girlfriend for more than 2 weeks and enjoys playing pranks on his unsuspecting friends.  A carefree kind of guy who doesnt get himself emotionally involved in situations. But the unimaginable happen when he bumped into the lady of his dreams (starring the gorgeous Preity Zinta) who was seated next to him in First Class en route to Sydney.  In Sydney, and thru a series of events, he suddenly realized that he is starting to fall in love with Preity's character in the movie.  The only snag - she is already engaged to be married to another man.  \n\nThen there's Sam played wonderfully by Saif Ali Khan (a real life Indian aristocrat). I have seen Saif in movies like Kal Ho Naa Ho, Race and Salaam Namaste and I think this is one of Saif's  BEST performances.  Saif plays a guy who falls in love very quickly with every girl he meets. On a holiday to Goa with his best buddies, he fell head over heels in love with a Swiss girl only to find out about the real character of his lady love a second too late.  Eventually, he found the lady of his dreams.  Check out whom the fickle minded guy chose.\n\nAnd finally, we have Akshaye Khanna playing Sid, a quiet and matured guy who is a mega talented artist.  He fell head over heels in love with a woman old enough to be his mother (played by Dimple Kapadia).  But every one around him (except maybe for Saif's character) found it difficult to accept Dimple's character into their circle.  In an Asian society, a man falling in love with a much older woman is pure taboo.  Find out what happened next.\n\nThe musical score was also first class.  I love the theme from Dil Chahta Hai... and this movie won the Best Film category in 2001.  This was also Aamir Khan's last movie before he took a 5 year break from movies.  (I read that he was going thru a difficult time in his personal life i.e. his divorce from his first wife).",
