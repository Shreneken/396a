    "summary": "To investigate the life of Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky, Andrei Gorkachov (Oleg Yankovsky) goes to Italy, where Sosnovsky resided before his suicide. Joining Gorkachov on his journey through Tuscany is his interpreter, Eugenia (Domiziana Giordano), who develops an interest in her client that is more than professional. Meanwhile, Gorkachov is beset by powerful feelings of homesickness as he wanders through the ruins of the countryside and meets a doomsaying mystic (Erland Josephson).",

            "content": "While it is probably safe to say that the films of Andrei Tarkovsky are not to the tastes of all audiences, it is also clear that Tarkovsky probably understood the language of cinema more than any other director.  In Nostalgia, a Russian researcher (Oleg Yanovsky), accompanied by an Italian interpreter (Domiziana Giordano), travels to Italy to research the life of a composer.  When he crosses paths with doomsayer Domenico (Erland Josephson), the course of his life is altered.  Deeply philosophical, the story does seem a bit obtuse at times, but the visuals throughout are absolutely stunning as Tarkovsky perfectly frames and executes every shot, many of them lasting several minutes, with razor-sharp clarity and creativity.  While Nostalgia may not be his finest work, it remains an impressive visual achievement.",

            "content": "Loose chronology, autobiographical elements, dreamlike sequences, thematically dense, slowly paced ... do you think that this Tarkovsky fella has a type?\n\nThough not one of the director's more immediately sweeping films (lacking the scale of films such as Stalker or Solaris) and treading on familiar territory stylistically despite being one of his last feature film projects, Nostalghia is still another great work from the acclaimed Soviet (or by this point, de facto ex-Soviet) director. A highly introspective piece, the plot revolves around internal longing and external disconnection - characters recognizing echoes of themselves in those around them but unable to rectify more superficial distinctions. Yankovsky's Andrei is a stranger in a foreign land (much like Tarkovsky himself), seeing familiarity in the emotions that surround him in the Italian countryside but finding only longing for their more familiar equivalents that he has lost access to. And yet, life goes on in all of its strange and miraculous beauty and tragedy, independent of what we perceive our role to be or what emotions we feel. \n\nEven among Tarkovsky films, Nostalghia gives off the sensation that it is one of the more languid despite barely passing the two hour mark, largely thanks to its lack of explicit plot, chronological progression, or real conflict. Regardless, it's worth making the effort to make your way through for one of the director's slightly lesser-known but dense and ponderous masterpieces that gives plenty of room for contemplation. (4/5)",

There is something magical about its slowed-down memory and dream sequences, its moments of epiphany, reflection and beauty and its overriding sense of loss and detachment.\nAndrei Gorchakov travels to Italy to research the life of Pavel Sosnovsky, an exiled composer who studied in Bologna before returning to Russia and hanging himself. Gorbachev, himself an exile, meets Domenico, a former inmate of a lunatic asylum who locked up his family for 7 years in order to avoid the apocalypse. Domenico believes that if he is able to cross the St Catharine Pool with a lighted candle, he will save the world. He gives the candle to Andrey who agrees to carry out the task on his behalf. Domenico later sets fire to himself in Rome to the 4th movement of Beethoven's ninth symphony. Andrey returns to the pool which has now been drained of water.\nThere follows one of the greatest moments in cinema. In a single unbroken take lasting over ten minutes, Andrey climbs into the now dry pool, lights the candle and starts to cross from one side to the other, shielding the candle from the wind. Twice the candle blows out and Andrey is forced to return to the beginning. At the third attempt he reaches the other side with the candle still alight and promptly collapses. It is impossible to do justice to this scene simply by recounting what happens. It is unbelievably beautiful. Just thinking about it makes me shudder with awe.",

It is probably Tarkovsky's most enigmatic and perplexing work, clearly made under the heavy influence of homesickness as Tarkovsky worked and lived in Italy at the time. As usual with Tarkovksy the film's visual poetry is stunning, long uninterrupted shots and pictorial musings lead you in the state of trance. Also the fear of a nuclear war that permeated the world at the time can be traced through the character played by Erland Josephson who believes that the world is coming to an end. He would play a similar character in Tarkovsky's next and last film 'The Sacrifice'.",

            "content": "Recuerdos, antiguas vivencias, momentos que han quedado en el pasado, pero no en el olvido. Nostalgia. A veces lo más cercano a revivir, es recordar.\nPara ver una película de Tarkovski y debido a la naturaleza de las mismas, es necesario hacerlo en el estado y momento adecuados. Es como intentar leer un libro en la noche; lo más probable es que cuando menos lo esperemos, ya estemos cerrando los ojos y no precisamente porque el libro sea malo. Lo mismo ocurre con las películas de Andréi. Uno de sus filmes es un espléndido libro, que se aprecia de la mejor manera en el momento adecuado.\nUna vez más, Tarkovski juega con el espacio y la naturaleza, cuidando cada encuadre como si de una pintura se tratara. Ninguna escena es presentada al azar. La misma lentitud con la que fluye el filme es probablemente lo que facilita esta situación.\nPodemos pausar la película en cualquier instante y lo que vamos a tener en pantalla es siempre una bellísima estampa. Y no sólo en la naturaleza; Andréi es capaz de encontrar la belleza hasta en un simple y viejo cuarto. Cada elemento encuentra su espacio ideal frente a la cámara, incluso las personas, aunque su distribución pueda notarse antinatural. En este filme, a diferencia de sus anteriores, podemos ver a Tarkovski utilizando trucos de cámara más de lo normal. Este detalle no ofrece más que ventajas, aportando una mayor estructura y significado a la narrativa.\nEs sorprendente como un director puede decir tanto con tan poco. Los diálogos son generalmente escasos, pero aún así trascendentes y reflexivos. Dichos diálogos siempre se encuentran convenientemente acompañados de extensos silencios, que parecieran presentarse para darnos tiempo a analizar cada palabra dicha.\nA pesar de lo lenta y contemplativa que pudiera resultar la película, la mayoría de los momentos son relevantes. Desviar la atención durante uno de éstos, podría significar perder el hilo y dejar de comprender lo que está ocurriendo.\nLa lista de ideas y conceptos que trata el director a lo largo del filme es extensa. Arte, estética, religión, política, filosofía; Tarkovski encuentra en sus películas el pretexto perfecto para desarrollar estos y más temas.\nSe trata de una cinta sumamente balanceda en todos los aspectos de una manera en la que sólo Andréi puede hacerlo. Un maestro de la reflexión, la contemplación y la belleza.",

It features some of the greatest cinematography ever pulled off and contains one of the greatest shots in film history (although, the same statement can be made of any Tarkovsky movie). The story is simple, but it's not the story itself that is so engaging but the connotations of many aspects of it. There is something about our main character that is so strangely likable and relatable, but I can't begin to describe why. I could go on for hours about how much I love this movie and Andrei Tarkovsky, but at the end of the day, I couldn't ever actually get to the heart of why I do. There's something that is so striking and emotionally charged about this film (and all of Tarkovsky's films) that you'll have to experience for yourself before you'll have any idea of what I'm talking about. Nostalghia's biggest downfall is probably how incredibly dense it is. I've watched this film twice and have been thinking about it for months and read all I can about it, but it's hard for me to say that I can understand exactly what this movie is \"about\". I have a strange feeling that that is what Tarkovsky wants though. Not to cause confusion, but reflection and thought.",

This is a known fact for people that have seen his films.\nTarkovsky is shoving off many of his known trademarks here. Flowing water, indoor rain, dogs, birds, et cetera. He continues to share the most beautiful images ever put on screen, in a lovely slowed pace with long shots of dolly-cams panning and zooming. We get some amazing deep focus action here too. In every image there is so much to see and if you look around you can consume more than a quick glance give. A random still from the film would be a beautiful poster on a wall.\n\nA poetic film, like \"Zerkalo\" in many ways with it's flashes of past. This is not as dream-like, more human and straight forward.\nIt's weird too, with some weirder settings and happenings.\nWe rearly shift places, few scenes.\nThe story is pretty hard to grasp, few answers, lots of guessing. \n\nI dig the 1 + 1 = 1 stuff and the Domenico -character.

A Russian writer travels to Italy to research about the life of an 18th century Russian composer. This being a Tarkovsky film, it's not as straightforward as that. I love Tarkovsky. \"Stalker\" and \"Ivan's Childhood\" are among my all-time favorite films. But even for me, this was way too slow, ponderous and oblique especially in the first 2/3rds of it. It felt a bit derivative of his and his screenwriter previous works. The cinematography though is breathtaking and it is a work that comes from a master filmmaker.

The film is very good, and it is engaging from start to finish. Tarkovsky always manages to convey a sense of surrealism to every one of his movies, and here we have a film that shows us an eccentric, yet brilliant plot that stands out due to Tarkovsky's impeccable filmmaking.  I've been a great admirer of his work, and he is able to craft something truly unique with each of his films and here he crafts something very good and is a must if you've enjoyed his work.

The lunatic, played masterfully by Erland Josephson, is looked down upon by a lot of local citizens. Apparently, in the past, he locked his family in his house for a long time, anticipating the end of the World. The movie documents his effect on the Russian traveler, and the traveler's longing to recapture his spirituality.\n\nA lot has been said of the ten-minute unbroken sequence where the lead protagonist attempts to carry a lighted candle from one end of a pool to the other. Some see it as utterly boring. Personally, I was fascinated. In it, we see how the protagonist finally attempts to do something in order to recapture his spirituality. For the entire length of the movie he has been an observer, now he is an active participant. To be fair, his action does take the form of a ritual, not the building of a church, or water immersion, but then again, so much of spirituality is ritual. Tarkovsky correctly identifies how it's the continuity that helps us get through life, knowing that some things will never change our strong religious convictions. That's when the protagonist finally comes to realize that action must take place. It's no coincidence that this scene takes place after a demonstration given by the Erland Josephson character. It's an amazing scene. In it he gives an intelligent speech about the desolation of art. It also imparts an important question to the viewer about those who truly make a difference in the world: the observers, or the \"insane\", who try to take positive action on the behalf of others.",

And maybe that's why neither one of them is as good as any of his previous films. Because this is filmed in the tiny and openly Italy instead of Tarkovsky's native Russia, which is more bigger, mystical and darker than any other countries in the world. \n\nNostalghia is set in a small town in Italy, where a russian wrier, named Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky) is to do some research about a Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky who committed suicide when he returned to Russia. And one does not need much imagination to figure out what's going to happened after words. Andrei also befriends a strange inhabitant madman named Domenico (Erland Josephson) whom lives alone after all his family died.\n\nI usually liked all of Tarkovsky's films, but Nostalghia is the only exception. It's to foggy, to slow, and the plot is simply not strong enough. But there's are some  good shots I must say that. I'm also a little bit disappointed about Erland Josephson who doesn't really speak that much as he use to, with his reflecting and intelligent monologues. I also suspect that he's dubbed. My conclusion is that it's a good looking picture, but the frame is to small. Thumbs down.",

He's there to do research on some composer who committed suicide, but he is actually much more interested in testing my patience.  Now I watch movies by directors, and being that I am on the library of Tarkovsky, it took me forever to get around watching this.  I already knew his movies are inherently slow, but a movie about a poet called Nostalghia, are you fraking kidding me?  It even SOUNDS as boring of an experience as reading the encyclopedia.  Well, it's about as boring as the title may lead you to believe it is, because NOTHING happens.  You can blame modern movies for shaping my malleable attention span to what it is today, sure, but I really don't think I'm out of line with my assessment.  There's a four-minute scene of our main character falling asleep while it rains.  There's an eight-minute scene of our main character crossing from one side of a drained pool to the other, trying to keep a candle lit...  I had to take a break halfway through this, due to the glacial pacing.  It is well shot, as expected, which is the one positive thing I have to say about it, but other than that, it's two hours of a man trudging through ankle deep water, smoking cigarettes and contemplating.  That's about it.

            "content": "Nostalghia (Russian: ??????????) is a 1983 Soviet film, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky and starring Oleg Yankovsky, Domiziana Giordano and Erland Josephson.\n\nThe opening scene is a single shot showing a family and their dog descending a hill, a large tree in the foreground, the distant countryside vanishing into the rolling fog. The camera pushes in imperceptibly, but continuously from the beginning. On the soundtrack, possibly diegetic, a sole woman sings. Meanwhile, the film credits scroll up, superimposed over the scene. The family and dog, upon reaching the area in front of a hut, stop moving. Verdi's Messa da Requiem fades in, overlapping for a brief moment with the woman singing. Once the foreground tree fully disappears, the scene freezes; the credits continue until the title appears, and the scene fades to black. The Requiem continues an audible transition to the second scene.\nThe Russian writer Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky) travels to Italy to research the life of 18th-century Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky, who lived there and committed suicide after his return to Russia. He and his comely interpreter travel to a convent in the middle of the Tuscan countryside where they look at frescoes by Piero della Francesca. Back at their hotel Andrei feels displaced and longs to go back to Russia, but unnamed circumstances seem to get in the way. The interpreter is smitten with Andrei and is offended that he will not sleep with her, claiming that she has a better boyfriend waiting for her.\nAndrei meets and befriends a strange madman, who is famous in the village for his insistence in trying to walk across a drained mineral spring pool with a lit candle. He claims that when finally achieving it, he will save the world. They both share a feeling of alienation from their surroundings. The madman says, while playing Beethoven's 9th Symphony, that mathematics are wrong, that 1+1 does not equal 2 but a bigger 1, and illustrates it with two drops of olive oil. Andrei later learns that this man used to live in a lunatic asylum until the post-fascist state closed them and now lives in the street. He also learns that this man had a family and was obsessed in keeping them inside his house to save them from the end of times until they were freed by the police.\n\nDuring an abstract dream-like sequence, Andrei sees himself as the madman and has visions of his wife, the interpreter and the Madonna as being all one and the same. Andrei seems to cut his research short and plans to leave for Russia, until he gets a call from his interpreter who wishes to say goodbye and tell him that she met the madman in Rome by chance and that he wanted Andrei to walk across the pool himself. The interpreter is with her boyfriend, but he seems equally uninterested in her and appears to be involved in dubious business affairs. Andrei goes to the drained pool. His attempt to walk from one side of the pool to the other proves more difficult than he imagines. It remains unclear if the fumes, his poor heart condition or both impede him from achieving his task. Meanwhile, the madman is giving a speech in the city about the need of mankind of being true brothers and sisters and to stop polluting the water. He plays Beethoven's 9th Symphony and sets himself on fire. During this time Andrei has been unsuccessful in crossing over the pond. When he finally achieves it, he dies.\nThe closing sequence is a close up of Andrei sitting with his dog in the countryside of the opening scene. As the camera slowly pulls out, the hut and his family are shown to be inside the ruins of an Italian church.",

Past (the black and white images of the lead character's homeland and family) and present (his journeys in italy) blend, characters intertwine and as Domenico says, \"two drops make a bigger one\" the imagery of mist and water pervade and the water drops in the soundtrack continually assert this theme. Even the buildings blend with water, either the rain coming through Domenico's roof or the river that flows through an abandoned house or the hot springs in the village. St. Catherine's  pool, too also reveals this overarching theme of spiritual unity (She attempted to unify the Eastern and Western branches of the catholic church). And the discussion about translation near the beginning of the film when Gorchakov comments that only once states are broken down can there ever be any understanding between people. Of course these states literally mean countries but also ultimately consciousness. The great unity he seeks arrives in death and the final scene is utopian, nostalgic and essentially melancholic. All of which makes for a beautiful film in a lot of ways.",

He is a philosopher who is always questioning and, in some ways, my kindred spirit whose filmic ventures become a part of me. You can see his own soul emanating through his films, aching to grasp the immaterial. In his deliberate pacing- those long, reflective shots -he tries to capture the essence of time and space, the moments when human begins drift in and out of their own consciousness. His films, especially this one, are always trapped in the wake of a dream. Reality mixes with the surreal and the illusive quest for truth becomes a relative endeavor. The unifying theme throughout his oeuvre is that man is his own truth. Only in our memories, the definiteness of the past, can we find authenticity within the universe of our own design. For some, it means self immolating. For others, it means carrying a torch. \"Nostalghia\" reminds us how life becomes about endurance, to ask ourselves the ultimate question- Who will carry the fire?",

            "content": "NOSTALGHIA follows the trekking of a Russian traveling through Italy along with his beautiful interpreter. His purpose for being there does not come to the viewer easily. Most of the scenes in the movie are filled with a lot of silence, and even the action that does take place, is minimal. Eventually, we come to understand that he is there to find some cultural reinforcement for his Russian background. As the film progresses, we seem to take on the role of the main character in the story, as an observer to events. Throughout his travels he becomes a witness to religious processions, theological discussions, and the rituals of a God-fearing lunatic. The lunatic, played masterfully by Erland Josephson, is looked down upon by a lot of local citizens. Apparently, in the past, he locked his family in his house for a long time, anticipating the end of the World. The movie documents his effect on the Russian traveler, and the traveler's longing to recapture his spirituality.\n\nA lot has been said of the ten-minute unbroken sequence where the lead protagonist attempts to carry a lighted candle from one end of a pool to the other. Some see it as utterly boring. Personally, I was fascinated. In it, we see how the protagonist finally attempts to do something in order to recapture his spirituality. For the entire length of the movie he has been an observer, now he is an active participant. To be fair, his action does take the form of a ritual, not the building of a church, or water immersion, but then again, so much of spirituality is ritual. Tarkovsky correctly identifies how it's the continuity that helps us get through life, knowing that some things will never change our strong religious convictions. That's when the protagonist finally comes to realize that action must take place. It's no coincidence that this scene takes place after a demonstration given by the Erland Josephson character. It's an amazing scene. In it he gives an intelligent speech about the desolation of art. It also imparts an important question to the viewer about those who truly make a difference in the world: the observers, or the \"insane\", who try to take positive action on the behalf of others.",

The most striking visuals come in the evocative black & white sequences, most likely a combination of flashbacks and Gortchakov's interior fantasies.

This technique, which is peculiar to his ability to sculpt the time, is reminiscent of the limps of the cross as a sacred symbol that permeates the whole film. Moreover, and personally, I was astonished by the way in which he creates a sort of superimposition that is the delayed recognition of the real image, a mixture of places forgotten, but still in the back of the protagonist's    mind, and my beloved Tuscany (Bagno Vignoni Spa, San Galgano Abbey)  and Lazio (Campidoglio)!

These are 10 years old (pointing at his own shoes) It's not important. All right! \r\nYou (Italians) know of great romances, no kisses, nothing at all. Very pure! Hence great. Feelings, unspoken feelings are unforgettable. Here (inside the church) it's like in Russia. I don't know why. You know I don't speak Italian well. Here's a story (starts speaking in Russian): A man saves another who was sinking into a slimy pond thereby risking his own life. Now they are both lying on the edge of the pond out of breath, exhausted. The rescued man says: âIdiot! Why did you do that? I live in there!â He (the rescued) was offended.â\r\nEugenia, in love with Gorchakov, frustrated that he does not seem to be aware of her advances:\r\nâYou're a funk! Full of complexes. You're not free. You all seem to want freedom but when you get it you don't know what to do with it or what it is. That's enough! It must be this country, the air one breathes here. Because in Moscow I met some wonderful men.\r\nWhat are you all after? This? (exposes her breast) Not you! You're a kind of saint. You're interested in Madonnas. You're different! One \"intellectual\" tried to keep me locked up! Can't I ever meet the right man? I don't mean you, you're the worst. But I swear I'll find my kind of man! And I have, he's waiting for me in Rome. You dress badly too. And you're boring. You're the kind I'd sleep with rather than explain why I don't feel like it. Don't you see? I found myself in a most embarrassing position! I've had enough! I can't take any more! I'd like to sleep for 10 days and wipe you out. Maybe there's nothing to wipe out because you don't exist. It's my problem. Why do I like idiots? Men with no charm. I might look young but I know all about charm! You know the night I met you I dreamt that a soft worm with lots of legs fell on my head. It stung me. It was poisonous. I kept shaking my head until it fell off. I tried to squash it before it reached the wardrobe but it was no good. I kept just missing it. I just couldn't squash it. Since that night I keep touching my hair. Thank God there's been nothing between us! Just the thought makes me sick!â\r\n\r\nGorchakov (in Russian): âShe's insane.â",

Tarkovsky has a way of making destructive images look beautiful. Nostalghia features many shots of run down looking buildings and rubble, but he makes those destructive images look very peaceful. Tarkovsky is also one of the best directors at setting a calm tone both with visuals and with the performances he gets out of his actors. Nostalghia is a bit weaker in story than others, but it more than makes up for it with its visuals. I left this movie feeling more relaxed than I went into it, and that's never a bad thing. I don't think this is a good place to begin with Tarkovsky, but for Tark fans, it's a gem.",

The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen and Tarkovsky's long takes can be rough, but the way the man constructs a frame is just astounding.

Tarkovsky deftly directs the depressing drama with an amazing script. Additionally, the cinematography along with the entire visual aspect is flawless. It's like viewing a piece of classic art with several layers and inches of depth. However, the film appears to go nowhere for the viewer. I can understand Tarkovsky loving the film, since the film is, in the end, made for his own viewing. I hate to use the word pretentious to describe a film, but here, it seems to make a lot of sense. By the end of the movie, after extremely tedious, however beautiful they may be, shots, things seem to become annoyingly overdone. The final sequence is beyond tiring as our protagonist continually walks back and forth in front of the screen with a candle. It's obvious that everything is symbollic, but some levity would have done the film some justice. I'd only recommend the film to die-hard Tarkovsky fans to see the master at work, but this is a weak effort as a whole, technical aspects aside.[/left]",
