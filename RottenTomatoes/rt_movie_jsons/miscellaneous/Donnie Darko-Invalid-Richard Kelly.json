This time (2022) saw the director's cut, and enjoyed it more than I expected. Like Tenet, it compels you to do lots of reading to \"understand what happened\" :).

            "content": "SPOILER!!!\nDonnie Darko, even the name is suggestive, it seems to have been made on purpose, it sounds so good. \nThis film is an absolute masterpiece, at least for those who, like me, love this kind of film. It doesn't make sense, what does it mean, what lessons does it want to convey? These are questions that we can never answer. \nwith this I learned to love Jake Gyllenhaal and now he is of my favourites actors. \nOf course we can theorize, try to explain it all, but watching it again will completely displace our theory. \nYeah, exactly, that's what watching Donnie Darko means. \nAt first I thought the most logical explanation was that Donnie lived in a time loop, in fact the \"end of the world\" meant the end of the loop, 28 days 6 hours 42 minutes and 12 seconds. \nBut looking at it again I lost my theory, what does it really mean? Was Donnie living in a loop or not, and if so, does he want to break it at the end? Or the simplest hypothesis, it's all the result of some kind of premonitory dream, he dreams about the fact if he wasn't dead, because yes, the plane falls on him and actually Frank doesn't save him. The ending of this film is very disorienting, the spectator watches the film formulating theory after theory, explanation after explanation, only to have it all thrown out. \nThis film doesn't make sense, but after watching it I'm left wondering \"does my life make sense? What if it's all a dream? What if I'm trapped in a loop?\". Let's say it's a film that makes you think about yourself and your existence. a scene that really struck me was the one where Donnie is talking to his professor about time travel. At one point the professor says that everyone who knows their destiny has the power to change it and therefore it is not predetermined\".\nGosh, how much does it make you think, is my destiny carved or not? do I really have the power to change it? if so, if tomorrow instead of drinking my usual coffee I drink a cup of tea, have I changed my destiny or was it predetermined that I should change the cup of coffee for the cup of tea? Oh god, my brain is going haywire thinking about this. that's what Donnie Darko leads me to think about.\nWell, now back to us, what is Donnie Darko about then? There are many themes: psychological disorders, time travel, the contrast between fear and love (we will also discuss this), bullying, vandalism, or political debates. WHAT IS IT ABOUT? \nWe can't know, we can only theorise. \nAnother interesting point is the opposition between fear and love. You will say to me, of course they are opposites, I know, but is it possible to divide everything into two categories? Every negative thing you put in the life line on the side of fear and every positive thing on the side of love. No, you can't do that for many reasons. Who establishes what is positive and what is negative, for me picking up a wallet from the ground and keeping the money in it can be a good or a bad gesture, everything is a question of ethics. Then what is meant by love and fear? Love can be the good that one wants for a person as it can be the representation of good (similar discourse for fear), this is a subjective thing, it depends on the person and the person. In conclusion, as Donnie says, you have to take into account all the other emotions, even if love and fear are the deepest. \nShall we also discuss Jake's magnificent performance? This film was very good, it hit the mark, it managed to convey many emotions, many points of view, many reflections. Is a very good actor, able to convey feeling that few succeed (we also want to talk about how he is beautiful, mamma miaaa, as I say from I come), congratulations really, it's a shame that has not yet won an Oscar, because he deserves it all. \nFinally, thinking is impressive how a movie like this has been successful and also how we are people like me who continue to watch it, because in waves what movie is? Boh. Tell you what kind it is? how do you decide if you barely understand what it's about. \nFor the last time, this movie doesn't make sense. \nThank you for reading so far :)",

            "content": "The greatest film of all of time. From scene to scene, from one dialogue to the next, the whole film is full of greatness. From perfectly angled camera shots to mastery of music and picture, this icon of a cult classic is re-watchable in every aspect. The plot creates a gregarious sense till the very end with a structure that all audiences will want to unravel. Each actor gives perfectly flawless performances. What makes this movie a top notch above the rest is due to its mixture of plot and perfect scenes that gives viewers something more valuable than a movie experience. The movie teaches a lesson that goes beyond it's unclear purpose of a movie but all is found through it's protagonist, with his dialogue the viewers can created own meaning through this character. That is what makes this movie the greatest, it's profound visual pleasing adapted with it's perfect soundtrack by Michael Andrews, Richard Kelly provides us with a classic for the ages and a titan of a movie. All this is clearly discernable even by one scene of this spectacular movie, and one I consider to be the greatest scene in film history, the Movie Theater scene. When Frank appears the lighting, the contrast, the dialogue, the purpose, even the very pace of this scene is perfect, and is all captured with music. Absolutely great. This movie is full of daring ideas, and a story that goes beyond everything it's competitors of psychological thrillers have accomplished. Lastly the biggest reason this movie should more than 100% is that it's meaning is about human purpose/existence, which is perfect with it's themes, especially it's time travel theme. 101/100",
