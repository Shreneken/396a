When Gabbar attacks the village, however, Jai and Veeru wonder why Thakur does nothing to help them. They soon learn that he has no arms, and that Gabbar was the one who cut them off. Enraged by this, they redouble their efforts to help.",

This is a great example of what Bollywood does best \u2013 mixing the various different genres and tones into one mostly coherent movie. The western core is also imbued with wonderful action-adventure elements and some truly fantastic songs, which are surprising scene-stealers. The characters are endearing, the villain is menacing and the central male friendship is wonderful. It's uneven in some sections, but for the most part this is a genuine classic and a reminder of how epic cinema truly was in the past.",

This movie delivers a lot of solid entertainment with its fun characters and fast-paced action scenes. The movie has a lot more humor than I anticipated and the movie has a great villain that is entertaining but also menacing when he needs to be. The premise of this movie feels very old school similar to a classic Western in Hollywood but I actually liked this movie more than the iconic Westerns I have seen so far. This movie is a bit silly and over the top, but it is easy to overlook because of how often it is fun to watch. I did feel the movie was a bit long and sometimes the pacing is affected because of it. However, as a whole package, I think the movie is a lot of fun and one that I can see how it has gone down to be a well-known classic for many people.",

This is Bollywood, so characters spontaneously break out in song and/or dance (or are forced to do so, in one scene).  The music adds a lot, especially to the more extreme psycho-drama elements (and they are very extreme).  But still the film is goofy and good-natured, like a Hong Kong film from the same era; the action sequences have that similar low-budget feel.  However, this is very much a western with horses, gun-play and some rocky terrain straight out of Budd Boetticher.  Unlike most westerns, it is 3 1/2 hours long (but suprisingly well-paced).",

            "content": "Ramesh Sippy's Sholay is considered one of the most popular Indian films ever made, and is one of the biggest Indian box-office hits of all time. Sholay is what Star Wars is for most american. The names of the characters that every one knows, and with a handful of actors that has been immortalized, like Amitabh Bachchan's character, Jai, being the Han Solo of Hindi cinema. As a westerner I'm also kind of enchanted  by this film as well.\n\nSholay is the story about the two small-time thieves and best friends, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) who's been hired by the former police chief Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) to track down the dangerous wanted criminal Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) who murdered Thakur's entire family. Thakur want's revenge, and he wants Gabbar alive so that he can deal with him himself.\n\nAs a westerner I actually liked Sholay, even though I still have a little problem with the fact that these Bollywood movies are like three hours long. It's actually a western film taking place in a rural indian village, so in this case we can call it a \"curry western\". It's quite easy to see that this film was influenced by such westerns as \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" and \"The Magnificent Seven\". But it's still a strong and emotional revenge tale, never the less.\n\nIt's action packed, with a lot of great shootout scenes, with two unstoppable action heroes, Veeru and Jai both kicking it like Butch and Sundance, two against one hundred. And I also love the chemistry between the two friends, with the hot headed Veeru and the cool and calm Jai, who always makes fun of Veeru. I can truly understand why Bachchan is such a beloved actor. And I had nothing against the musical numbers, which I found very entertaining, specially the one with Veeru and Jai on the motorcycle. Overall, I thought that Sholay was quite an amusing and emotional western with great actors. Thumbs up.",

            "content": "For better or for worse, 'Sholay' will always hold a special place in my  heart for being the first Bollywood movie I ever saw. It took me a while to watch the films of the largest motion picture conglomerate in the world, but I suppose later is better than never. Interestingly enough, 'Sholay' draws clear influences from Hollywood spaghetti-Westerns, and as far as Bollywood films go it is quite homogeneous, sticking mostly to one genre (action-adventure) rather than mixing multiple ones.\n\nBut I bet you're wondering what I thought of the actual movie though. Well, 'Sholay' is the exact representation of what I like to call a 'flawed epic.' The high, intense moments hit especially hard (usually) and the characters are well developed and overcome a long series of trials and tribulations before coming to the ultimate conclusion of the story. \n\nHowever, there are a significant number of flaws present in the construction of this film, which is what I mean when I say, 'flawed epic.' Arguably Bollywood's most famous motion picture is far from perfect, and I would also argue should be far from 'classic' status. 'Sholay' suffers from serious pacing issues in the script, especially in its first act. Several scenes early on fail to add anything worthwhile or significant to the plot and were clearly shoved in strictly for comedy's sake --- and were not at all funny in my opinion. With all these errors in pace and flow, one really feels the film's length (3+ hours) at times. Even the film's final battle, between an armless ex-cop and the main villain, comes across as ridiculous.\n\nWith all that said, 'Sholay' still succeeds as an exciting action-adventure epic, making the audience care for its main characters (especially the duo of outlaws) and showcasing some pleasant, if obligatory musical numbers. It is probably not worthy of its legendary status, all its flaws considered, but 'Sholay' is going to stay a classic regardless of what most Westerners think.",

I love performance of Amjad Khan as Gabbar Singh (in my own list I consider Gabbar Singh to be #1 Best Villain from Indian Cinema). Biggest cast from Indian Cinema, India's legendary actor Amitabh Bachchan as Jay, Dharmendar as Veeru, late Sanjeeve Kumar as Thakur Baldev Singh and late Amjad Khan as notorious outlaw Gabbar Singh. Entire cast involved gives what is to be noted as their careers' only best performances. Memorable dialogues as well as scenes follow in this most-cherished film. \r\n\r\nThankur a former Police officer, who once captured notorious outlaw Gabbar Singh, was threatened by Gabbar to be punished for capturing him. Gabbar Singh breaks out of prison, and massacres Thakur's family along with a young kid, Thankur in rage goes to take revenge from Gabbar, and gets traped himself. Gabbar cuts off Thankur's hands, as Thakur had gripped Gabbar in his arms while capturing him, saying 'These are not hands but hands made of steel'. Some years later, Thakur recalls two petty thieves, who are close friends named Jai and Veeru played by legendary actors of India 'Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra'. Thakur hires them to help him capture Gabbar Singh. First the two decline offer, as Gabbar is most notorious outlaw, but ultimately agree to help the town, which is frequently robbed of grains and flour by outlaw gang of Gabbar every now and then. \r\n\r\nI happen to remember each and every frame of this classic film, directed by Sindhi-Indian director Ramesh Sippy. Under BBC's poll at the near of Millennium, this film was voted #1 Film of Last Century from India.",

(The dance in the bandit's camp is unforgettable.)  Great performances and Bollywood's unique stamp make this familiar tale into a memorable cinematic experience.",
