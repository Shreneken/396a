This fiercely questioning film is  intelligent and qualified enough to raise the voice and uphold the cause. It's bound to become the talk of the town. The writing of the film makes it the best Hindi film of the year. And the performances of Amitabh Bachchan and Taapsee Pannu are probably what makes the film further enticing. It's an important and bold film which is rock solid about it's thought on why a woman's consent matters. And it has a command rushing out through the climax, which shouts out to feminism in a slick way. In complete thought and emotion, the film is also extremely entertaining. Don't miss 'Pink'. It's likely the best Hindi film of the year.",
