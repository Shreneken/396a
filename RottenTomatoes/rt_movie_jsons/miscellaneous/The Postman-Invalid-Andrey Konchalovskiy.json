But, as in many of the russian films, it is just depressing; vodka, madness, vodka. At least in this one there was no corruption, much, and the postman had been sober for 2 years, pretty much the only one in the village though. I keep wondering why the russian ministry of culture finances films that show the current, still soviet style life in the country to the outer world? How are we supposed to feel about it? What are we to think? At the same time, in the back ground you see a missile taking of, so not everyone is poor, miserable and forgotten, clearly. Disturbing and..... depressing. Gorgeous log houses though :)",
