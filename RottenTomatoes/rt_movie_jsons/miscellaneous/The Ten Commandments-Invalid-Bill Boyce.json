    "summary": "In this animated adaptation of the Bible story, Moses (Christian Slater) hears the voice of God (Elliott Gould) from a burning bush, which inspires him to confront Egypt's pharaoh (Alfred Molina) and demand freedom for the Israelite slaves. The pharaoh agrees after a series of horrific plagues, and Moses leads the Israelites through the parted Red Sea into the harsh freedom of the desert. There he ascends Mount Sinai and returns with the Ten Commandments. The narration is by Ben Kingsley.",

This film has enough good intentions to fill an ark, and it was obviously intended to be easily digested by kids but the movie's sub par animation and lousy voice work leaves a lot to be desired. I think the filmmakers sorely misjudged just how sophisticated today's kids have become. \r\nThis clunky relic is a throwback to the old \"Davey and Goliath\" Sunday morning show, but it's way too serious to even be any fun like that program was. I did somewhat admire this for taking itself seriously and not throwing in a lot of Disney-like talking animals or catchy songs to punch things up, but there has to be some kind of compromise if you want to get your point across to your intended target audience.\r\nI have a high tolerance for boredom, but even I had all but given up on this at the halfway point. All those good intentions helped the directors assemble an impressive list of actors to provide the voices, but like the animation, the dubbing is embarrassingly primitive. The makers would have had more luck getting Stan and Cartman to teach kids bible lessons. At least they would have paid attention.\r\nThis feels more like Sunday school than an entertaining night at the movies. It is misguided in almost every way possible.",

The animation is a little sketchy as sometimes it seems as if people are moving way to fast and sometimes do not move as clean cut as some animation films I have seen. This is 2008 and that is unexcuseable for any film. \r\n\r\nHowever, the story was told well and down to the tee-in which that made it slightly enjoyable. I think it could of been more children related, as it is animated, however my little nephew that I sit down to watch it with was hardly engaged. The dialogue at time seemed a bit stale.\r\n\r\nDont let this review stop you from watching this one though. It's not by all means a BAD movie, but for an animation film in todays age, it's lacking.",

And as an educational exercise for kids it is a valid effort but as a cinematic piece of entertainment it falls sadly short off the mark.\n\nEven narrated by the great Ben Kingsley, the film doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come close to capturing the magic of animations such as Shrek or Toy Story.\n\nElliot Gould voices God to great effect.  Christian Slater as Moses is a bit of a misfire. He simply doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the range or depth in his voice to give the character the necessary gravitas.\n\nThese days, animated features are not only brilliant in their execution but they are big business.  Competition is tight for that all-important kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 market, so I was really surprised at the clumsiness of The Ten Commandments.\n\nThe characters appeared wooden and the American voices and humour didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit well with the subject matter.\n\nI do find the story of Moses fascinating and as a straight retelling, it is clear and coherent. But I just hope the animation in the remaining two stories improve, because the poor quality CGI in this film greatly hinders the final effect.\n\nAs a way to introduce your children to bible stories this film could be for you, 2 stars.",

I agree that it was especially suitable for children, with the accompaniment of an adult to explain certain things.  The movie does require a certain amount of knowledge of the Bible accounts though, so you may see things that seem strange (the manna from heaven, the quail falling from the sky, the rock flowing out water) because they are left out of other versions. All in all, covers much more biblical detail than both the original Heston film and the Prince of Egypt.",
