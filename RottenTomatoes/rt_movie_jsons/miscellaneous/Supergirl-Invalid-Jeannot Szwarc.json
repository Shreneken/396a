The cinematography is cheap, out of place, terribly shot many times with bizarrely out of place special effects most of the time with ok/good ones 20% of the time. The music isn't good as its over the top and feels out of place because the action is so bizarre that's on screen already even without it, it just makes it even worse most of the time though by itself its ok if that makes sense. The editing & pacing are awful., things just happen a lot of times like mountains appearing, were unsure of the villains motives, and a cohesive story really is never told until the end when she gets the power source back but mostly everything else that happened in between contributes nothing to it. The worst thing is Supergirl's development is she starts out as clueless and is still clueless at the end. Stay away from this no matter what.",

You think this lack of continuity is great, but you're hit by a introduction to Kara Zor-El (Helen Slater), our hero, who lives in Argo City, a community of Kryptonian survivors. As I said before, no explanation! Then, we meet Zaltar (Peter O Toole), the leader of this ultra-depressed community of continuity errors. Next, some gonad lookin' plastic ball named the Omegahedron is rocketed to space and Kara goes after it. We are then introduced to Selena (Faye Dunaway), a power-hungry, would-be witch who is our villain. We also meet antihero Nigel (Peter Cook) here. From there, it becomes disaster. Kara is flyin' through what is clearly a sound stage and into a pool of water, then bursts out as Supergirl. But wait it gets better, she causes a flower to bloom with her heat vision and defeats 2 would-be rapists. Everythin' leads to lots of trials for Supergirl, but she wins by sendin' Selena to the Phantom Zone with the help of a demon that the witch summoned, and that demon is right away shown as a man in a rubber suit. As a whole, this is mostly like \"Superman IV,\" the film that followed: the action is boring, the special effects look cheaper, and none of the actors appear interested in where the plot's goin'. Slater does her best and Dunaway enjoys camping it up, but even they can't save \"Supergirl.\" With that, this film deserves The Burnin' Medallion Of Badness.",

            "content": "Forgettable and ordinary. The real shocker with \"Supergirl\" is how this is the Superman films' \"Catwoman,\" and only children will love it. Watchin' it feels like you're 'bout to lose a million brain cells and that's real bad. For starters, there are many problems. The first one comes really quick; no continuity and no explanation for anythin'. The titular heroine is a girl named Kara Zor-El (Helen Slater), a member of a community of survivin' Kryptonians called Argo City. As I said before, no explanation! I would have loved to have been given info on how these people escaped Krypton. But no, instead we meet Zaltar (Peter O'Toole), the leader of this community of continuity errors! He steals and eventually loses a gonad lookin' plastic ball called the Omegahedron. Kara goes after it, while Zaltar demands to be put in the Phantom Zone. To me, that's a cowardly move! Anyway, we are then introduced to our villain, a power-hungry would-be witch named Selena (Faye Dunaway). Selena bitches to her boyfriend named Nigel (Peter Cook) about how she wants the world when suddenly the Omegahedron falls into somethin' that I can only refer to as \"chip dip\" from its looks alone. She grabs it, goes insane out of nowhere, and steals Nigel's car! Next, Kara is flyin' through what is clearly a sound stage with flashin' lights and crashes her pod directly into a pool of water, and bursts out fully costumed in a Supergirl outfit! This film has already shown that it does not care about continuity, so that makes sense. It is clear. But wait it gets better, she proceeds to pick a flower and uses her heat vision to make it bloom and somehow not cause a forest fire! Back to Mommie Dearest, who comes home to a abandoned building and boasts to her roommate about no longer havin' to pay any bills, for she has a cruddy plastic ball that fell out of the sky. Jump cut to Supergirl stoppin' at a truck stop and she's almost raped by 2 truckers who speak in a mediocre Jack Nicholson impression. That's a pretty stupid move since they obviously saw her fly down, therefore knowin' she can kick both of their asses easily. Of course, she does so, nailin' both would-be rapists in the balls so hard, they get launched into the air! Then, it becomes disaster and never rises back up. And the final battle? Our heroine faces what is supposed to be a giant shadow demon, but in fact is a man in a rubber suit. Supergirl nonetheless turns the demon against Selena, and the villain's feckless helper, Bianca (Brenda Vaccaro), is sent to the Phantom Zone along with her boss and their demonic rubber suit. Finally, Kara returns the Omegahedron to a darkened Argo City, which then lights up again. Now, I'm gonna break down the script. In the film, the story is set up like a rescue mission with a time limit. Then, out of nowhere, Kara enrolls herself into a all-girls school! And why, since you do know Argo City needs the Omegahedron like right now? This is no time to find yourself and make friends with Lois Lane's sister. Not even halfway through, we're dragged into a totally different film. \"Supergirl\" is now a coming-of-age story 'bout a girl who has great but inconsistent powers. One of the bright spots is the chance to see the Phantom Zone as a whole dimension, but the film comes off as sexist and boring. Our wide-eyed, cheery heroine, of course, only has a few days to recover the Omegahedron, but instead we get Slater and Dunaway fightin' over Hart Bochner, love potion and all that. Bochner has zero personality and is just Mr. Fanservice the entire film. Why try to take over the world with the Omegahedron, Dunaway? Try to get laid instead. There's no suspense, the effects are inconsistent rangin' from OK to painfully obvious they just sped up footage or filmed it on a bluescreen, and lackin' the presence of Christopher Reeve is enough to prove that \"Supergirl\" is D.O.A. While Slater does her best, Dunaway enjoys camping it up, the other actors try their hardest to make things entertaining, the cinematography is competently shot, and Jerry Goldsmith's score (and Goldsmith does give this film one of its only good things) is well composed, it is ultimately not enough. You want a better \"Supergirl?\" Go watch the television series. Also, let me give this spin-off The Burnin' Medallion of Badness. And before I break into overall sum-up, if you're a DC Comics fan and you love the Superman films, check out the first two. For other DC fans, you'd be better off watchin' other DC films (even \"Steel,\" which is terrible yet better than this trash). If you're a superhero fan in general, DC or Marvel, avoid this. If you're a Marvel fan, just avoid DC-related films. If you're more into other stuff...I suggest you stay at home and watch \"Power Rangers\" with your children. So avoid this \"Supergirl.\" Maybe it could be enjoyed as a more campy film, but since this was meant to be the first major superheroine movie - team-based superhero flicks notwithstanding - \"Supergirl\" contributed to a really bumpy start before \"Wonder Woman\" came in and saved the day nearly 33 years later. Characters: 1/5 Story: 1/5 Acting: 1/5 Special Effects: 0/5 Direction: 0.5/5 Cinematography (it's competently shot, as I said before): 1.5/5 Soundtrack (the only redeemin' quality): 4/5 Overall: 1.5/5",

This was a very ambitious movie that suffered from a lack of direction. Literally - the director might have been drunk, because he's gone on to do a lot of television and he seemed to direct competently there. So what went wrong? Where do we start? Tangled subplots, campy dialogue, clumsily handled feminism, a rushed backstory to ensure we have tons of time just... watching Supergirl fly aimlessly. Half the movie, Kara is acting like a dazed toddler or a lovesick puppy over some guy she just met.\n\nBut there are some glimpses of good between all the facepalm moments. When Kara isn't wide-eyed, Helen Slater is a convincingly strong superhero. Jimmy Olsen dropping by to connect it to the Superman movies was nice - Matt Frewer's random cameo as well. Lucy and Zaltar were pretty great. And there are just enough hilarious - and hilariously bad - moments to make it a semi-enjoyable watch. And Selena...\n\nOh, let's talk about Selena. Faye Dunaway steals this movie and doesn't give it back until she's blasted to the Phantom Zone. Bianca makes for a great comic foil; these two are crazy in the best of ways. They really don't seem to belong in a Supergirl movie at all (how did they even KNOW about the Phantom Zone??) but they're so much fun you can almost forgive that gaping plot hole.\n\nSo all in all, you might want to give it a watch. At to see why Helen Slater keeps showing up in Smallville and the Supergirl TV series, and some wonderful eccentric witches that predate Hocus Pocus... and to see how a decent script and decent directing can be edited into such a trainwreck.

You can actually see the wires. It's as if the film crew didn't care to spend the time or energy to hide the wires. The story, the plot, and the premise was horrible. The acting was wooden by all involved, but at least Helen Slater (sister to Christian Slater) looked hot in that mini skirt. I don't mind cheesy camp, like Flash Gordon, but that film was done tongue in cheek. Supergirl had none of the flare, nor the campy goodness that it needed. But that hasn't changed in this day and age, with that horrible Supergirl TV series. Yeesh!! BTW, there's a quick panty flash by Faye Dunaway. If you blink, you'll miss it.",

The love interest has zero personality, the action sequences lack suspense, the effects are inconsistent ranging from okay to painfully obvious they just sped up footage or filmed this on a bluescreen. And of course Superman just happens to not be on Earth at the moment and on a peace-seeking mission the other side of the galaxy. Totally not a lousy explanation as to why the Salkinds couldn't get Christopher Reeve to make a cameo. Yet they got the same actor who played Jimmy Olsen to reprise the role as a hasty attempt to reassure us that this movie was still canon before Superman Returns said \"Nope! Only the first two happened\". And the script is full of idiot decisions. The main conflict arises because of...a toy butterfly. I am not exaggerating. A sheet of plastic is all that's protecting Argo City from the forces of space. And Supergirl spends most of the movie adjusting to Earth. Save my home? Who cares about that? Let me enlist myself in a boarding school and befriend the sister of Lois Lane whose existence in this universe hasn't even been hinted up to this point. She only has a few days by the way but instead we focus on some crap about a love potion. Wait, what purpose did the boyfriend serve again? He had no personality and was just Mr. Fanservice the entire picture. Why try to take over the world with the MacGuffin, Faye Dunaway? Try to get laid instead. Maybe Supergirl could be enjoyed as a more campy film but since this was meant to be the first major superheroine movie - team-based superhero flicks notwithstanding - Supergirl contributed to a really bumpy start before Wonder Woman came in and saved the day three decades later.",

Well obviously if I'm asking, you, of course, get a piece of shit!\n\nThe first problem comes right away, as you are given no exposition what so ever, instead given very brief introductions to new characters, as if we are expected to know who the hell they are! A girl named Kara Zor-El (Helen Slater) is part of a community of surviving Kryptonians in a pocket of trans-dimensional space called Argo City! As I said before, no exposition! I would have liked to have been shown or told how these people managed to escape Krypton! If I am to go off the continuity of the first Superman film, nobody was told that the planet would explode, as of course, the Supreme Council kept Jor-El from warning anybody, because they thought it was only a bogus theory! \n\nBut no, instead meet Zaltar(Peter O'Toole) leader of this community of continuity errors! He ends up stealing and eventually losing some gonad looking thing called the Omegahedron. So instead of going after it himself, Kara goes instead, whilst Zaltar demands to be put into the Phantom Zone as their civilization is about to be destroyed yet again! If you ask me that's a pretty cowardly move! What happened to a captain going down with his ship?\nAnyways,  we are then \"introduced\" to our villain,  A witch named Selena ( Faye Dunaway). Selena bitches to her boyfriend or whatever named Nigel (Peter Cook) about how she wants the World, when suddenly that Omegahedron falls into her chip dip or whatever that shit was! She grabs it, goes insane out of nowhere, and steals Nigels Car! \n\nAnd now for some special effect feces! Kara is flying through some shitty sound stage with flashing lights and crashes her pod right into a body of water, only to then burst out fully costumed in a Supergirl outfit! I mean why the hell not? This movie has already shown that it doesn't give a rats schlong about continuity, so why not just give her the costume right away?  But wait it gets better, she proceeds to pick a flower and uses her heat vision to make it bloom and somehow not start a forest fire! \n\nBack to Mommie Dearest, who comes home to some abandoned building and boasts to her room mate about no longer having to pay any bills, for she has some shitty plastic ball that fell out of the sky! Jump cut to Supergirl stopping at a truck stop only to have two truckers attempt to rape her, whilst speaking in a mediocre Jack Nicholson Impression! Pretty stupid move as they obviously saw her fly down, therefore knowing she could kick both of their asses easily! Which of course she does, nailing both in the balls so hard they fly into the air! Remember the epic fight in the city with General Zod in Superman 2? Yeah well, forget about seeing anything cool like that at all throughout the entire 2-hour movie! In fact, there is really no point in me even continue delving any further into the rest of the plot!\n\nAll you need to know is that the special effects look like they are from the 50's when this is an 80's film. The story is boring, confusing, and lacks any continuity or logic! The acting is either way over the top or way under performed! And worst of all, the characters are all uninteresting to the point where you don't even give a damn what happens to any of them.\n\nYou could say it's so bad it's good, but I say it's just a Super Turd! 1.5/5 stars.",

Supergirl\nI'm going to be reviewing one superhero movie a month and well for this month(even though I wanted this one to be later) I got Supergirl. After Superman IV: The Quest for peace the name Superman became a product for money and no genuinely cared about making a superhero movie anymore. However they decided to change it up a bit instead of it being Superman again they decide to use his cousin Kara/Supergirl.\nAfter losing a powerful orb, Kara, Superman's cousin, comes to Earth to retrieve it and instead finds herself up against a wicked witch.\nThis movie fracking sucks. By the look of this movie, you can tell that no one gave a crap about the source material which is very sad because I hate every single female hero in the DC except the three known as Supergirl, Starfire, and Zatana. Supergirl being my favorite. The producers said lets throw in a love story, let's make the villain an evil female who's jealous and wants to be pretty, manipulative and have everyone be her slave. We can't have Supergirl save the planet, or do something noble it has to be a giant cat fight, that's what happens when old straight white men write stories about strong young women. They just want to be pretty, the music is very bland and almost like not their and doesn't engage me in the film. Which I find to be very odd because I put the disc in and I hear the John Williams Superman theme in the main menu so I'm thinking maybe this movie might be a little engaging but no it isn't. The effects are terrible as well because they just look so much better in other 80 films. I'm giving this film a one out of five.",

Faye Dunaway is a hoot as the villain, Hart Bochner is a gorgeous stud-in-distress, and Helen Slater is fantastic as Supergirl. She makes the movie work and my favorite scenes include her joy at discovering her powers on Earth. It is also just great to see a woman lead in a superhero movie. I cannot wait until a modern version arrives in theaters someday.",

            "content": "This film is great, but only in the right context. The cast is amazing; some are in their later years, but so what? Helen Slater, 19 at the time, is amazingly beautiful in this, and does a layered performance of bravery, curiosity, and uncertainty. Her performance is much more natural than Christopher Reeve's ever was. The \"flying ballet\" is stunning, especially for 1982 tech (when it was filmed). Goldsmith's soundtrack score especially shines here. The effects are purely mechanical or matted, and well done from that aspect. But generally the vision was more grandiose than could be achieved at that time. And a major flaw is that it's obvious that many of the actors' takes are first or second takes.But the script has much more of an edge than the Superman movies, e.g. the rape attempt when Supergirl first arrives in the city, and the drunken house mother. There was an entire town built for the bulldozer scene (parts of which were stolen later for Aliens). For the writers at that time it was natural for Supergirl to battle another woman, thus a witch, who through a series of errors created then pursued Supergirl's boyfriend. In some ways, Helen's Supergirl was a proto-Buffy. Unfortunately the various edits of the film mangle the complex storyline, losing a lot of the motivations and context. The Director's Cut from 2000 helps restore a  lot of that. And when compared to the first 3 Superman movies it stands up well, and is actually superior to them.",

            "content": "After the success of the Superman films, producer Alexander Salkind thought it would be a good idea to do a film based on the Supergirl series of comics, which started in 1958. It seemed like a good idea at the time, especially as Christopher Reeve was in no hurry to play Superman again. But Supergirl would prove to be a troubled production, filmed on the hoof and the special effects look rushed too, but it's just cheesy fun mostly. On the Kryptonian community of Argo City, Kara Zor-El (Helen Slater) accidentally loses a powerful orb known as the Omegahedron, which belonged to Zaltar (Peter O'Toole). Blown into outer-space, Kara follows it, and transforms into Supergirl along the way. The Omegahedron lands on Earth, and it ends up in the hands of witch Selena (Faye Dunaway), who uses to break her relationship with warlock Nigel (Peter Cook), and wreck power on the world. Kara arrives on Earth, and enrols at an all-girls school under the name of Linda Lee, quickly befriending Lucy Lane (Maureen Teefy). But when Selena wages destruction, Kara/Linda becomes Supergirl. It follows the same formula as the Superman films, but this was rushed into production to make a Summer 1984 release, but it ended up being delayed when Warner Bros. dropped it from distribution, and negative publicity saw it flounder at the box-office, which was a shame, as it's not as bad as it's made out to be.",
