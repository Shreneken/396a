It also gives a look into mental health issues and knows when to take itself seriously and doesn't undermine some of the most powerful moments with comedy.

            "content": "Mary and Max is told almost like a fairy tale. I found it abounding with charm, and I was captivated by the way it presented the story almost exclusively through narration and reciting of the letters. The characters were fleshed out so well, and I loved seeing these two people through their own eyes. They both were unique and had interesting outlooks of the world around them. There is something magical in the way it presents the mentality and life of an introvert, and how powerful friendship can be to those who have struggled to find it in the past. I have seen many movies about the valuable bond of friendship, but few that have so poignantly presented how difficult it can be for some of us to reach out and make those bonds. Even more powerful is the way that Mary and Max handles the mental conditions of the protagonists. There are so few movies that are willing to normalize something like Asperger‚Äôs. It seems that in the past Hollywood was obsessed with ‚Äúfixing‚Äù all that was wrong with a character in order to earn their happy ending. But this movie is strong enough to allow a person to live life with a condition most of us would categorize as a disability and yet still consider them acceptable, whole, and lovable. The road to happiness isn‚Äôt always by becoming like everyone else, but instead loving who you are. That‚Äôs a mind-blowing message to get from a cute little animated film about a guy who eats too much and a girl who thinks babies come from beer. There were minor things that I didn‚Äôt love in Mary and Max, but I don‚Äôt want to spend too much time dwelling on those. The animation style isn‚Äôt exactly attractive, but I thought it worked considering the characters and topics it covers. I was disappointed by the fact that it teased that this was based on a true story, and then I read afterwards how little of it was actually true. That doesn‚Äôt really affect the quality of the story, but they probably could have left that title card out. Perhaps the only real complaint about the movie itself is that it didn‚Äôt have the resolution I was anticipating. I was so excited to see the end I had built up in my mind, but instead they went a different direction. That being said, it was a bold finish to a totally delightful film. I‚Äôd highly recommend Mary and Max to everyone.",

This is how animation should truly be handled, not like the generic take of Hollywood.  Elliot's craft is superb and he handles subtle topics with both wit and melancholy.  Max is a very relatable an ingeniously funny character whose death demonstrates the dark undercurrent of the film. Yet also pertains that this is a real film, filled with real consequences and heartbreak and sorrow. The dark comedy tone is thoroughly enjoyable and I loved Max's cynicisms. Mary was the other piece in the puzzle, and she was wonderful and eminated the true honesty which the film doesn't shy away from.

This movie certainly surprised me...it was way better then I imagined. \n\nThe premise seems simple, but there was so much going on in the story. It begins with poor Mary randomly picking an American to write a letter to. Little did she know the person she wrote to was a 40 year old man who's name is Max and he is a New Yorker who has Asperger's Syndrome. A weird relationship and I can why Mary's drunk mother was not pleased. She was a drunk and totally forgot about it and it continued on. However, it is a simple friendship that changed both of their lives for the better. Some parts made me shake my head, but I enjoyed it. I totally would not let my 8 year old talk to someone like Max, not only because he is old, but because there is a lot wrong with him mentally...but oh well.\n\nThe animation was creepy...cool...but creepy. It didn't help that the colors are dark, but the animations they used were awesome, but creepy. \n\nIt was a little slow at one point, but I couldn't stop watching. It's one of those movies you can't keep your eyes from. Maybe it's the creepy animations, but maybe it's the story, maybe its both. It got a little dark near the end, but there was a shimmer of hope at the end and it made me smile.\n\nI totally recommend this to those that need a weird and different movie in their lives. It has creepy animations, but the story is amazing. It was sad, but funny as heck. Poor Mary...poor Max. Both had poopy lives before they found each other through letters. Out of five stars, I stamp this with 5 stars. \n\nFavorite Character(s): Mary, the rooster, and Max (even tho he had a lot of issues).\nNot-so Favorite Character(s): Damien and Mary's mom",

But even with those things considered I think everyone should try and watch this movie. It has amazing messages and it deals with all things professionaly. It has it's funny moments, as well it's heartbreaking and depressing moments. Though the latter is more likely. It's a lovely story of 2 penpals who find themselves being not so different from each other. As a lovely friendship comes to life, many issues come as well. It's a movie that has to be seen and cannot be explained with just mere words. I couldn't recommend this movie more. \"However, we can choose our friends. And I'm glad I have chosen you.\" :')",

The kids may not find this animated movie nice as there are dark and realistic portrayals of what we encounter in our lives. The movie is mostly black and white clay animation with slight shades of red. I haven't seen many stop-motion animated movies but the best I recall was 'Coraline' also released in 2009. Well as much as Coraline was filled with fantasy this one far realistic.\n\nThe script is very good, giving us lessons we need to learn in life like moving on no matter what happens. The voice-actors also did fine job especially Philip Hoffman as Max. I liked the movie but it felt kind of repetitive after 1-2 conversations though the letters between Mary and Max. Also it tries to pity its characters a bit too much. What I did like is there were humorous moments popping up here and there despite the theme of the whole film being sad. If you don't like stop-motion animation or realistic films with not much excitement unlike what you see in your day to day animation films I suggest you keep away from this one.\n\nRATING: [3.5/5]",

Mary was an 8 year old girl who has a birthmark with the colour of poo on her forehead, her family weren't any better. Her mother was an alcoholic kleptomaniac who offered little comfort to her; her father was always busy at work with a strange interest in taxidermy of birds. Max was an obese, middle aged, Jewish man with Asperger's syndrome. The only things they had in common were that they both enjoy collecting action figures from a cartoon and that they both had no friends. This unlikely friendship grew over the year, however, Mary became a psychologist and publishing a book about Max which enraged Max, would their friendship last?\n\nI enjoy the really bleak atmosphere and characterization of the protagonists, nothing good was going to happen to them and we are made to know it immediately. The grey scale clay figures and set designs were really well crafted. There were some really controversial subjects being discussed with ease, not only Elliot was able to poke fun of the pop culture, he was also able to show some deep insight into the lives of the marginalized groups.\n\nThe narration was simply superb like his earlier works, as the characters/narrator narrates, the events happen at the same time to help the audience visualize the words in a dark, yet humourous way.\n\nI must admit that I was wallowing in tears at the end. It really touched the soft spot within me as I've always been fascinated with Asperger's syndrome. Mary and Max is a must see.",

Mary is an Australian child with a withdrawn father and a kleptomaniac and alcoholic mother, trying to survive the scarcity of means of her family and the bullying in her school, a lonely child deeply ashamed of the birthmark in the centre of her forehead. Max is an overweight atheist Jew in his 40s that lives in New York, has several pets, a blind neighbour and only finds comfort in chocolate. By chance they become pen pals and soon their letters will bring solace and spice to their empty lives. In their mail they talk about dreams, chickens, suicide, autism, loving relationships, candy, pet fish and loneliness.\nIt has been classified as a black comedy but despite the obvious humour of some scenes there are some very tragic episodes here, the whole mental illness background is sorrowful and at times there is very little to laugh about. To me this is more a buddy movie, the tale of two people helping each other and embracing their differences. The subject matter is apparently loosely based in the director's (Adam Elliot) 20 year relationship with a pen-pal that is very much like Max. Mary is a reflection of Elliot's personality and something else, a marginalized individual.\nI loved the movie, the characters and the script are very well crafted, they seem likely and strike the right keys without being overly sweet or dramatic. It feels like an honest film. Don't miss it.",

Finding love. The story (while at first look may seem for kids) is not at all for kids.

As the two become pen pals and share each others warts, secrets and interests, they become mutual friends, perhaps the only friends they could ever have, and that is the emotional power that arises from this quaint little film. The craft is beautiful and almost eccentric --  ranging from the bleak, black-and-white color pallet of Max's world in New York to Mary's brown and hazel Australia, reflecting on her birthmark, the color of poo as said from the film's narrator -- which catapults this gem into bigger heights of stop-motion of animation. While their friendship blossoms and flourishes, it touches on many themes and issues that would never seem apparent in this innocent quirky film. From Mary problems --  dealing with childhood neglect, her mother's alcoholism --  to Max's obesity, depression, a startling realization of his Asperger's Syndrome and the obscurity of life, it definitely is a mature film as it quickly delves into the darker depths. It's rather wise of introduce mature themes like mental illnesses and its through that avenue does the friendship Mary and Max become stronger and more powerful. \n\nIt's deeply a depressing film, but one filled with glimpses of hope and humor, and never has friendship displayed on film become ever so emotionally resonating. It's a masterpiece in my eyes, and one I will cry to and laugh with for many years to come.",

One thing everyone can appreciate about this film is its originality, I've never seen anything quite like this; an animation that looks at very dark subjects such as mental illness, and in top of that manages to be pretty funny at the same time. The use if narration is different and original, and the way colour is used within different environments is also clever, topped with some funny and very good animation. It's overall an interesting and intriguing concept that really pays off.",

            "content": "What a weird movie. Not in premise, but just in the characters and the way it's set up. Black and White and Chocolate Hotdogs and such. So peculiar, so strange, so inventive. My father watched this movie with me, his words after watching it \"Weird.\" It is, I had my head turning after the first line came out. 'Mary and Max' is a film that shouldn't be viewed by children; it deals with a load of mature subjects and is completely inappropriate for children. I just thought I might as well say that before starting my review. Onto my review of the weird 'Mary and Max'. \n\n'Mary and Max' tells the tale of a young girl, Mary (Voiced by Bethany Whitmore) a lonely girl, who befriends a man named Max (Voiced by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) via penpaling. They bond, and learn more and more about each other through the years. \n\nI donno how else to explain the film. It's a film you need to watch to get the plot in full form. \n\nSomething I enjoyed a lot about the film was the switch between color (Mary's side) and black and white (Max's side). Visually, it's interesting. The tone, you'll notice switches as the color switches. From light (Mary's side) to dark and gloomy (Max's side). I liked that idea, because it better sets the mood, and feeling you'd be going through as well as the characters emotions. And that one slice of color on Max's head is something to look at. A single star on a bleak sky \n\nThe animation is spectacular really. The tiny bits of detail in the characters s there, and their worlds look completely real. The animation has dull shades of color, but it sets the mood, and works overall. Its clay-mation that you know has been worked on for a long while. It's sharp, inventive, and show's craftsmanship and hard work. \n\nThe character designs are sharp to the tip. Max is expesically interesting in form. His fat, pardon, is well detailed, as well as his facial expressions, which run out quit well. \n\n 'Mary and Max' is never really engaging; it just plays at the same speed, and bores along. It's not very original, but has surprises that I had not thought of, but never really make you tense up. The film tends to become dull at moments, it's never exciting. Or thrilling, or full of life. It's just plain old dull. Colors, and story, and dialogue. It's all dull to the point of depression.  The film loses you midway through after picking you up, because you get bored with the same picture of a bleak, bleak world for those two leads. You wish it became light and fun but it doesn't, even the jokes, which do make you laugh come out as creepy and sad. \nThe dialogue is of its own, good. Some of the dialogue is witty; other snippet's sad and depressing. It's all good and doesn't come out corny or cheesy or however you want to put it, the dialogue, which runs the whole movie, is pretty sharp. \n\nIn particular I found the character development to be very solid. You learn more about the characters then you'd thought you'd have, and by the end you know about everything the character thinks or does, and how they act and why they act that way, you understand their opinions and emotions.  That was solid work, and in the end you do become emotionally attached to the characters in some weird form. \n\nThe problem is the plot. It's just not enough to keep you tuned in. The plot, is just so thin and unoriginal, you are not kept interested from it. The film sports interesting ideas, but overall it's squandered by the way to easy main plot. \n\nAll and All, 'Mary and Max' is a very weird film, with beautiful animation, and solid character development but squandered by the overpowering dark and gloomy tone, and thin plot stretched its limits. C+ 3/7/14\n\nP.S: The film may not be for the mainstream film audience, but it will delight the more art-house filmgoers. So, I separately rate the film a 4 Stars rating. As a film it's good, but as for me I didn't care much for it.",

In fact, it is one of the best films I have seen in any year; as of this writing, it is currently sitting at #16 on my 1000 Best list. (The next film down the list I first viewed in 2013 is Berberian Sound Studio, which sits at #32.) It is a profoundly affecting, perfectly-related story with near endless heart. While I know there are people out there who fit the description, I simply can't imagine anyone not loving this. And to top it all off-it's claymation. \n\nPlot: Mary (voice of Blackwood's Bethany Whitmore) is a lonely Australian girl who decides she needs a pen pal. She goes to the library, piecks out a phone book at random, and then stabs her finger down on a name, copies the address, and writes a letter. In this way, she introduces herself to Max (voice of Love Liza's Philip Seymour Hoffman), a forty-four-year-old shut-in from New York City. Max is, at first, hesitant, but, with a few interruptions, thus begins a twenty-year correspondence between the two, and they-both with mental issues (Mary is depressed, Max has a disorder the revelation of which is one of the movie's big twists-though many who have friends who suffer the same disorder will be able to pinpoint it long before Max does)-find their best friends in each other.\n\nWhile this is not, ostensibly, a romance (though there is an undercurrent of that throughout), I can't imagine a purveyor of same, be they novelist, scriptwriter, director, poet, whatever, who would not be able to draw endlessly on Mary and Max for inspiration and advice; this is a textbook on how to build flawed, relatable characters that audiences can easily identify with. The deepening friendship between the two, as well, is pitch-perfect as regards its pacing and the changing emotions between the two. Nothing about this feels staged or artificial, and while I know I have mentioned this already in the review, it bears repeating: the painstaking attention to building realistic characters and situations is underlined, triple and bold, in red, by this being claymation rather than live action. No wild flights of fantasy here; Elliot gives us a simple story, simply told, and he does it with such phenomenal empathy that it is impossible, at least I find it so, not to be as affected by this as anything else I have ever seen. Mary and Max is one of cinema's crowning achievements, as perfect and beautiful in its execution as Hotaru no Haka, and it deserves to be just as highly regarded.*****",

It's very dark throughout, and the opening lines hint that it is not for kids. As the plot progresses, there is really nothing but mature topics: mental illness, loneliness, friendship. Though quite slow, the story kind of sucks you in and the little animated freaks become very much real. Much better characters than most movies.\n\nThere is plenty of comedy in the movie as well. Mary is an odd little girl with odd little questions. Max has Asperger's and is very awkward, sometimes inappropriate. Again, it's just great writing to build the characters this way and let them work through their problems. \n\nSo, pretty top notch. I've just never seen anything like it. Someone on imdb compared it to Up, and I do remember a short montage in that animated movie packing quite a punch. Mary and Max is definitely darker and, I think, more mature.

It uses animated characters with child like  naivety and applies to it a gloomy story where most of the time the characters don't understand what's going on but the audience does.  Then it throws in some irony and puts a nice bow on top of it with a happy ending.  Afterward I was left feeling like what the heck did I just watch and what was I supposed to get from watching it? Was the animation a way to hit on any depressing topic that could be applied to it so it could come off as comedic?  I don't know.  I don't necessarily wish I didn't see it just out of pure curiosity.  It's definitely an odd little movie.",

Claymation is a genre not delved into by many studios, let alone independent ones due to the sheer time and effort and money that needs to go into it, so it warms the cockles of my heart that people still put movies like this out there. Also speaking as a friend of several people who live with aspergers i appreciated and liked how they handled the subject matter. The animation is fantastic, the cute almost storybook-like way the narration guides the plot is charming. Charming is really the best word i can pick to describe this film off the top of my head but it offers so much more. Its often dark, bleak, funny, quirky, and one can't help but feel completely immersed in the original and endearing characters created. Mary and max is a film i whole-heartedly recommend to anyone who can appreciate a well thought out plot, fantastic animation and writing, and a beautiful charm i have found in seldom few other movies",
