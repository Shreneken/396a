Every characters are enigmatic, they all have a secrete objective that converges into a gigantic explosion. By the way, the special effects let me open-mouthed. All the extras are well chosen.",

However, I will say this was the best nap I've had in a while. This story line with the ATP however, does have potential to be made into something great. But, not in this type of creative aspect.",

Secondly, the plot had SO much potential and they wasted it with overly-violent scenes and way too long fight scenes. Which is a shame because I love dystopian anything. The acting was terrible. The only one who was slightly good in this movie was Michael Pitt. The lead character (Edger something) I had seen before on the life story of Gianni Versace and he was good in that. In this he was awful. Though to be fair it was a horrible script and he probably did the best he could with what he was given. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.

It's just your basic cliche-ridden action flick. But it reaches for originality and creativity, which is more than you can say for most. The acting is fine; Ramirez, Pitt, and Brewster serve the film well. Copley and Bergin might as well have been non-name actors for as much attention as they draw to themselves. The dystopian, Big Brother theme can never be overplayed, given the world in which we live. The only problem with it is the fact that we're supposed to be rooting for outright criminals for no other reason than that they're the ones the government is trying to stop. That's hardly a reason to make a hero out of Bricke; let's face it, he's a dirtbag. The only reason he's at all appealing is Ramirez's attraction. \n\nBut I stand by my rating.

This movie is a complete waste of an actually good concept. I think a more talented writer and director could have pulled off something complex and interesting. This movie fails on many levels and is a big mess. For one, it is way too long without ever justifying it. The movie spends a lot of time with exposition and world-building but it is so boring and poorly handled. A few action scenes do happen but I didn't care at all about the outcome. If characters died I felt nothing and there were no stakes I really cared about. Overall, this is one of this year's weakest offerings and one of Netflix's worst investments in recent memory.",

As there are only a few scenes that attempt to bring the mindless shooting and explosions together to form some sort of plot, you would think they would try and do a good job on them but no. I will give some examples:\n\nHours before the heist They go to Pitts characters family home and kill his father for no reason at all, maybe just to add some pre-heist tension as he gets shot and is badly injured before the heist but even that doesn't work as he makes a miraculous recovery after brick leaves him bleeding out on the floor of a car park. I do recal them needing to steal some explosives so they might have been there for that purpose but it seems they forget to actually do that.\n\nThey finally break into the bank, 2 of them just get in a lift directly to the vault, one of them gets into the building disguised as a garbage man and the girl rings up a random guy who comes with no back story, and says \"I just didn't know where else to go\". That guy invites her in, without question, to the main control room for the signal thing and tries to kiss her?\nSo the guys in the vault room blow up the vault locks, the door opens and out walks....the garbage man???? Oh and he has a forklift truck in there as well. How they get out is just as a mystery as how the garbage man got into the locked vault as the scene just jumps from the vault to the corridor where they make their effortless escape. Not sure why they bothered blowing the door up if you could just walk in through the back?\n\nThe girl is an ace hacker tasked with the mission to dissable the signal thing. She goes to great effort to successfully disable it for 30 mins. When the signal comes back on it apears that Pitts character is immune to it so the whole story thus far is pointless. \nA \"good\" cop shows up to ask the girl \"what the hell is going on\". They had attempted to give this cop a back story but it served no purpose and I found myself hoping his question was going to be answered as I had no idea either. A fight scene broke out and he died.\nThe girl then goes back and blows up the server room anyway so hacking it to give them 30 mins in the first place was pointless if it can be permanently disabled.\n\nBrick and the girl make their escape to Canada in a magical semi truck which barely has a scratch on it after a face full of military fire power and  concrete road blocks at the boarder and luckiy for them, the military just gave up pursuing them once they smashed through. After a minute of deep romance, brick dies and she lives happily ever after. Well she did manage to go and collect her partner in crimes ashes before hand but yeah.\n\nTotal garbage!",

But as the plot unfolds and each would-be action hero discredits themselves, we see the true cheap entertainment is the movie which our own simplistic expectations demanded. Megaton gleefully refuses to let the movie become a hero story or even a political statement as was Minority Report. When Sharlto Copley utters the words \"what the hell is going on\", it speaks not only to the tangled web of a plot but to our tangled post-post-modern reality. The Last Days of American Crime is not a fun summer blockbuster, though some may mistake it for such, it is also not an irredeemable pile of trash, as it has been called by many an unenlightened film reviewer.

            "content": "Even by relaxed standards which we judge widely-available Netflix movies during a time of quarantine, The Last Days of American Crime is a staggering waste of 150 minutes. It's based on a 2009 graphic novel series and even by the sliding scale of shut-your-brain-off action movies, it's numbing, dreadfully dull, incoherent, and stitched together with hoary genre clichés and little creative forethought. It's rare that I come across a movie that seems so willfully ignorant to explore the implications of its own premise.\n\nIn the near future, the U.S. government is in the final stages of implementing the American Peace Initiative (API), a special radio signal that stops crime in its tracks. It acts as a brain blocker on anything illegal, stopping the user from being able to follow through. Graham Bricke (Edgar Ramirez) finds out the hard way when his bank robbery crew become some of the first test subjects. American citizens are desperate to flee to Canada before the API goes live. Bricke gets seduced by computer hacker Shelby Dupree (Anna Brewster) to pull off one big score. The government is readying to destroy a billion dollars in currency before going digital, and Shelby's fiancé, Kevin Cash (Michael Pitt), has the connection to pull off the heist of the century.\n\nFirstly, there is not nearly enough material here to justify the gargantuan Avengers-esque running time. You could realistically slice down a whole hour and not impact its middling entertainment value or clarity. While I was watching it didn't even feel like a movie, more like a series designed to be binge watched, where the plotting becomes much more slack because the filmmakers anticipate their show will be digested in quick succession and that they have earned patience. It irritates me in television and it certainly irritated me here as well. Don't blithely assume that your audience has infinite patience when you haven't given them a proper story to properly engage with. Just about every scene could be trimmed down and some of them go on punishingly long, especially scenes where people are getting shot. There's one late scene that goes on for what feels like five minutes of just watching two characters get shot. It's so gratuitous, like much else in the movie, that it borders into unintentional anti-comedy.\n\nAs for the action, director Oliver Megaton (Taken 2 and 3) delivers very little of note. There's a car chase here, a shootout there, but no set piece that actually develops or proves that memorable. It's all just disposable noise that amounts to little, not even fleeting, escapist entertainment. This is a heist movie where the actual heist planning is ignored. The most enjoyable part of a heist movie is the intricate planning and then execution of that plan, combating the unforeseen complications and overcoming for triumph. If your entire movie is centered on a big heist, don't treat that like it's another meaningless plot element. I cannot believe the filmmakers failed to realize that if the viewer doesn't know what the dangers, problems, and scheme of the upcoming heist will be, then everything feels arbitrary and unsatisfying, and it does so here. The actual heist, pulled off around the 90-minute mark, is not worth the buildup and lack of accessibility. It's just another haphazard action set piece, not the culmination of planning and an important payoff for carefully manufactured setups. If you're tuning in for fun action, you'll be sorely disappointed to find there's more time spent torturing people onscreen than there is for sustained and exciting action.\n\nThe awful characters we're left to spend 150 minutes with are hardly worth that investment. Everyone is kept strictly as stock archetypes, and even when the screenplay tries to develop them, it follows a strictly predictable path to minimal results. Oh, someone has a family member in custody and is being pressured to snitch? Oh, our silent-and-seemingly-conflicted protagonist wants to avenge his dead brother because he cares and stuff? Oh, our oddball criminal scion wants to make a big name for himself outside of his father's shadow? The fact the movie spends so much time with these characters while giving them so little dimension, little personality, and little to do is another indictment on the bloated pacing. If we're spending this much time with our criminal rogues, the least you can do is make them interesting and dramatic and colorful. The protagonist's name is Graham Bricke, which sounds so boring that it must have been generated by an A.I. The femme fatale super hacker lady is really here just to look sad or sexy, here to deliver three uncomfortable sex scenes including a near rape as well. The other notable female roles in this movie include News Anchor, Lesbian 1 and Lesbian 2, Female Tweeker, and Female Cop. Hooray for depth.\n\nThere are two characters that had a chance of being interesting but are so mishandled. The first is Kevin Cash, our wannabe gangster. Pitt (HBO's Boardwalk Empire) brings a much-needed dose of energy and theatrics, like he's trying everything in his power to desperately hold your flagging attention. Even his pathetic overcompensating nature is tiresome. A scene where he, his father, and his younger stepmother (another fine example of female character representation in the movie) shriek and bicker at one another is just embarrassing and misplaced comic relief. He's boring. The only other potential was with Sharlto Copley (District 9) as a disgraced police officer. We spend plenty of time with him early in the movie, establishing his outsider status, perhaps some regret, and hoping that his position of authority will be better explored as he wrestles with whether the police force is worthy of its state-decreed exemptions to the API. Nope. He just becomes another dude in the final act that could have been replaced by anyone else. It would be like devoting so much time to Henchman #12 and his personal crisis of self in a Bond movie only to watch the lug unceremoniously die in a final action rush. Was that worth the time spent?\n\nIts Purge-like premise sounds intriguing and worthy of exploration until, that is, you really think about how silly it all is. So a magic radio signal is going to inhibit your brain from committing known wrongs, but does that mean that the radio signal will have to blare constantly in order to have a lasting effect, otherwise its enforcement will be limited? What happens to sociopaths who don't even register right from wrong? They will be able to move and act without abandon. Then there's the day-to-day corruption, graft, greed from all pillars of society, politicians and Wall Street and officials that exploit their positions for illegal gains. Seriously, if this radio signal inhibits the fruition of illegal acts, would Wall Street just shut down? Would the factory owners who knowingly skirt worker safety for profits be able to operate? Would criminal defense attorneys be able to operate or would they use the ethical justification that everyone, no matter how heinous, deserves legal representation? If you think about a capitalist society, it's built upon people behaving not so nicely, so would all facets of the economy grind to a screeching halt?\n\nThere is one aspect of this world building, even with what the meager story has established, that could be interesting to explore, and that's the exceptions to this new order. Police officers are getting implants that make them immune to the effects of API, though in a world where a radio wave eliminates criminal acts, do you still need a police force to protect and serve? Regardless, this special class of exception is deserving of further exploration, a socially relevant angle to tap into the inherent advantages offered to the top one percent who don't think the rules apply to them. In fact, if Last Days of American Crime was going to run with its silly premise as is, and during the pre-activation countdown timeline, they should have presented a story about those who are given the state-sanctioned privilege to act with impunity. Let's watch the elite get their special exemption chips and plan for the New World where they maintain their vaunted privileges. It would at least make the movie socially relevant as well as a better development of its sci-fi premise.\n\nWatch, dear reader, as I present you two better scenarios with this silly premise. The first is the most obvious and that's life AFTER the implication of the AFI, presenting life under a new fascist order and a group of revolutionaries trying to thwart the radio waves. Imagine a group not plotting to pull off a bank heist but ridding their community of the AFI and giving them autonomy over their minds and bodies again? There's an ever-present hostility that forces the characters to keep their thoughts on safe topics, having to communicate with subterfuge to not set off their brain jailers. It would be like a dystopian version of that classic Twilight Zone episode where little Bill Mumy where everyone had to think \"good thoughts\" or else he would magically banish them to the cornfield. That's interesting, that's genuine conflict, that's characters under great duress trying to escape a fascist nightmare without tipping off the invisible sensors in their own minds that could trigger. There's a larger goal of freeing their fellow citizens from this tyranny as well. That's already one hundred times better than simply trying to steal money before the clock strikes zero. If it was only ever going to be \"one big last score\" then why even bother with the mind-control antics? It could have been anything at all.\n\nHowever, if you wanted something more low-key, you could take a different path with the idea of the bucket list before the API goes live. Think of two teenagers who don't have the means to escape and feel like they haven't fully lived and a whole lifetime of rebellion and adventures they had been dreaming towards will now be snuffed out. The screenplay already floats the idea of a criminal bucket list but why not run with that idea as the core of your movie? Two teenagers making the most of their time together over the course of one long crazy night of cutting loose, testing their boundaries, and acting out the best ways they know how, learning about each other and the depth of their friendship before their minds will not fully be their own. It takes the teenager coming-of-age model, feeling like a stranger in your own body, and gives it a PG-13-Purge twist, with the distant tragedy of the looming tyranny ahead to up the stakes. Even that development would be better than \"one last score,\" and these are just two ideas I've come up with while writing this film review. Think what could be accomplished if a professional screenwriter spent weeks fleshing out a better version.\n\nAlas, the version of The Last Days of American Crime we do receive is powerfully plodding, incoherent, empty and arbitrary, and definitely not worth your precious 150 minutes. With the current state of the world where thousands of U.S. citizens are protesting in the streets over a militarized police state and wanton brutality, it makes Last Days look even more phony and ill-conceived as entertainment. It doesn't examine the implications of its own fascist police state, it only uses it as a pointless backdrop for an arbitrarily plotted  \"last score\" heist before it all just falls apart, spent of imagination and intent.\n\nNate's Grade: D+",

The one thing I did like was the fact they were trying to hint/foreshadow things that could possibly happen in America in the near future. That’s when Kevin Cash started to shine and single-handledly made the movie. It’s a shame how they ended it in my opinion but I wasn’t angry, I liked the wittiness and cutthroat actions they had throughout the movie to get out of situations. I think they used too many guns and not enough death (I can count on both hands the amount of times someone should’ve gotten shot).

Police appear and disappear in a flash from little guns and those big trucks. Ludicrous plot lines. \n\nGood music though. They hired the right tunesmith. \n\nSave your time. Go watch Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.",

Olivier Megaton has crafted a pinnacle of artistic expression that even as merely a direct-to-streaming product, manages to outperform all of this spring's cinematic blockbusters. That is an impressive feat but it does not stop there. Karl Gajdusek's script is dramaturgical gold, right up there with the best in the hallowed halls of darkened seats and quiet popcorn munching. Anna Brewster, Édgar Ramírez and Michael Pitt star in this action overflowing twenty seven star showing, putting on fugacious brilliance which can literally be called superior to the sum of all the acting you can witness on the big screen without an umbrella or a driver's license.\n\nIt's a lockdown action movie. Laugh. Be thankful it isn't the 1920's Spanish flu when home entertainment consisted of books and black and white radio.",

I thoroughly enjoyed Michael Pitt's character and thought he did an amazing job of sociopath gangster lord's son. I'm not going to rate this anywhere near the best movie of the year and the run time is certainly a little too long, but most of us have time on our hands to watch a long flick. Good job Netflix.

I don't think the Director knew either but then, given the screenplay, that is hardly surprising. I was ever hopeful that the actors might drag something out of the mess but they seemed to be sleepwalking through their lines and the awful (and seemingly gratuitious) set piece 'shoot outs'. It became particularly laughable (and embarrassing) when Brick and co went to the king pins house where the son had an argument with his father. Not only did this 'argument' not make any kind of rational sense, it didn't assist in moving the plot forward at all and seemed like the actors were... acting. Wooden does not begin to describe it. It was a pure hodge-podge of unrelated and irrelevant scenes that only kept me watching as I wondered how much worse it could get. At over 2 hours, someone has a lot to answer for and very little to answer with. This one is a definite MISS... better to watch paint dry.",
