If you're going to make cuts like that maybe just do music videos.\n\nAlso, a tip for your next film. Make the opening shots actually about the character that we will follow. That way we'll know who to follow after that, even if the editing gets a bit frantic. Also, don't stay on shots too long. Like a girl getting out of a car... from many angles... once again... thats music video. Not necessary in film making. \n\nbest of luck next time!!!\n\nOne more note. I wish Netflix would bring back the rating system. \nI want to be warned before I start to watch anything bad next time!\nI think business wise, there's an opportunity for other services to overtake Netflix, if they use a good ratings system.",
