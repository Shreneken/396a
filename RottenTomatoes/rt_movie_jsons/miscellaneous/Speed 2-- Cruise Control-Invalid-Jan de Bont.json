    "summary": "Annie (Sandra Bullock) is looking forward to a Caribbean cruise with her cop boyfriend, Alex (Jason Patric), who purchased the tickets to make up for lying about working on the SWAT team. Their trip turns dangerous, however, when an explosion disables the ship's communication system and it becomes clear that the vessel is under someone else's control. Alex and Annie must fight for survival as they discover that John Geiger (Willem Dafoe), a crazed passenger, is behind the chaos.",

The movie would be better if it were not a sequel to \"Speed\" and just were its own movie.  I mean, the boat ride was definitely thrilling, and Willem Dafoe plays a really good villain, who can crash the boat into an oil tanker.  I also really love the reggae music in the soundtrack.  The acting was not very good, but Sandra Bullock did OK with what she was provided.  The chemistry between Bullock and Jason Patric was just not there.  That's why this movie is out of focus.  However, if you love some great visuals, \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" could be the movie for you! In conclusion, \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" is nothing like its predecessor, but is still passable with popcorn.",

The best part of this film is the ending where you can tell most of the budget an effort went into and it is entertaining to watch. But is it worth the hour and a half investment to get there....absolutely not. The acting is wooden, silted and the actors have no chemistry at all. The dialogue is not good at all. The editing in this at times especially in the middle of the film is not good. The cinematography is very uneven at times. And the pacing absolutely feels terrible especially in the middle of the film where it feels it is going no where. The plot is very farfetched as well. Terrible Action Movie Overall.",

We see a man on a motorcycle struggle to catch up to a truck, and it's not hard to guess that the male protagonist is on the daredevil motorcyclist. \nLater, in the movie, as the couple boards a crew, we see a realistic boat scene, with beautiful details all around. It makes the entire movie come alive, until one of the actors says their line. The sub-par acting left the audience unable to focus on the fantastic special effects and the  amazing details of each scene. The plot dragged along, leaving viewers dozing off during the multiple irrelevant scenes we've seen several times before. \nIn the end, Speed 2: Cruise Control has deceived us into believing it was a thriller, while in reality it was nothing more than a travesty.",

A rogue cruise ship heading straight toward a port and no one on land knows it?  A huge ship is barreling through the port, and the other small boats and skiers don't notice until it hits them?  And then running into the port itself...shouldn't that massive ship have run onto land long before it went a few blocks into the town?  Come on...at least make it believable.

This film fails in every way to live up to its very entertaining predecessor and I was not surprised to see why this movie sucked. Jason Patric takes Keanu Reeves place and he is one of the most forgettable action stars I have seen in recent memory. The first 30 minutes are an absolute borefest and the characters were just really uninteresting and you don't end up caring about anybody you see on screen. When the action did start on the boat, it was surprisingly tensionless and I didn't feel any tension or suspense happening. All the moments of humor did not work and there was a lot of stupid moments that just had my eyes rolling. What happened this time Jan de Bont? You did an excellent job directing the first one and here you just really dropped the ball because the pace is as slow as a boat and every character is cardboard cutout. The original Speed succeed at being an non-stop fast paced thrill ride with well done action sequences and it is one of the best action films of the 90s.    The only real time when the movie got a little bit interesting was during the final half hour when the boat crashed on the town and there was a mildly suspenseful chase, and the special effects were pretty solid in those sequences. Overall, this is a completely forgettable sequel that you should just avoid and you are better off watching the original Speed that is 100% better.",

Now I understand why it's known as one of the worst sequels to a great film ever, if not, the worst. It's boring, the writing is so bad, and it's annoying. I never felt so annoyed in a film in a long time, and I don't remember Sandra Bullock being so annoying in the first one, or the character being so stupid in it either. I really like Sandra Bullock, but why did she think it was a good idea? Keanu Reeves did a great choice of not being in the film, but for his character, they seem to not care about it and gave a reason of his character's exit so fast and so sudden that we didn't know what just happen. The character is replaced by a bland character and Jason Patric was bland too. Everybody seem to be either sleepwalking, or just act annoying. The only one that's having fun in it is Willem Dafoe. But even his crazy, in an enjoyable way, acting is not enough to save this atrocious of a sequel. Even if it's a stand alone film, it still would've been terrible and be so stupid. The movie should've been short, or just not be made, it really shouldn't be this long and just felt like 4 hours went by, and it looks like they are just making up more plot devices to make it even longer. I honestly thought Speed 2 - Cruise Control was going to be so bad in a funny and enjoyable way, but it just end up making it so infuriatingly bad that I feel bad for people that watched this irritating pointless sequel to an amazing film. Makes me glad that there's no Speed 3 and it shows that the movie was just made to make money.",

It is a shame that Keanu Reeves didn't return from the first film but at least Sandra Bullock returned. Keanu Reeves was meant to reprise his role as Jack Traven but he declined it as he didn't like the script. Instead Jason Patric takes his place. Keanu Reeves was praised for not returning as Speed 2 was awful and a total box office bomb. Both Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric regret starring in Speed 2 and I don't blame them. They must be embarrassed starring in Speed 2. I think director Jan De Bont found it hard to do a good job second time round because Speed is so good and his other films are not very good at all. Speed 2 could and should have been so much better. What a joke!!! This film might as well be called slow because it is just a slow moving cruise ship not a speeding bus.",

He didn't want to make this and didn't see Speed having any sequel potential, unfortunately though, he was contractually obligated to make this because Hollywood gotta have that money! \n\nThe first thing that jumps out at any audience member is with them thinking, 'How is this going to work on a boat?' Speed was Speed because it was on a bus that had to go over 50, dodging pretty much every obstacle imaginable. The cruise is on water with pretty much nothing in the way for most of the duration of the movie. Right there someone should have realised that this wasn't going to work and the fact that it is 2 hours makes it all the worse. This was originally thought of as a Die Hard story and while that would work this really doesn't. I can't believe 5 people wrote this. \n\nThat being said it isn't all awful, while the characters might be a tad more goofy this time around I don't think it was entirely out of place. Bullock still remains a likeable screen presence with humor and Dafoe is always great as the bad guy with Patric doing the best he can with what is given and it was great to see Glenn Plummer again. It also has some good build up but does get into the boat maybe a tad too quick. The movie also has some spectacular set pieces, namely the one right at the end that cost a quarter of the movie's budget. Ultimately that isn't enough and the movie is just kind of, 'eh'.\n\nThe story was written by 5 people and it's near identical to the original and even has some of the same plot twists, including the villains story, was anybody even paying attention? Still though, I gave it a chance and for about 45 minutes I didn't really understand the hate, but the rest of the movie happened and the cheesy dialogue started to settle in. That 2 hour running time really works against it so much, I couldn't really choose any scenes that should have been taken out but it was still too long for its own good. Again, I gave it a chance and I can't say I hated every second of my time watching it, the movie went by at a fine pace and I can't say I was ever bored but I really wasn't involved as much as I was with the first one. With the original, I was glued to the screen and couldn't look away, with this I checked my phone every now and then to see if I had an email or something, the movie just didn't grab me. It isn't as exciting visually and I think that's where it failed for a lot of people, besides a few set pieces at the start and the massive one at the end, there isn't that much to look at besides people hurriedly running around a boat and while that would work for any given action movie, for a 'Speed' movie, it really works against it. \n\nSpeed 2 might come up short in almost every way to the original, it's still a decent action movie by itself, take out Speed from the title, call it something else and I'm sure the reviews wouldn't have been so bad. The movie badly needed a rewrite to make the story feel more like a Speed movie, one idea they had was a plane that couldn't go above a certain height and in concept alone that sounds a lot better and more like a Speed movie than this movie actually is. It isn't great but I didn't hate it. They're also trying way too hard to make a catchphrase out of the 'relationships based on intense...' line, even though they change it everytime they say it, Joss Whedon is sorely missed. At least Keanu Reeves was smart and 'jumped ship' on this project to tour with his band.",

It was a crime to class this as a sequel to the amazing first film, it might've got a little bit of respect it it was just called Cruise Control because there is no speed, just a boat going slightly first...and that's it. The action is poor and even the good bits are so-so. It's amazing that that this is directed by the same person who made the first film. The characters are annoying and have no heart to them and the film dumbed down to a wider audience that I suspect didn't really care about. It's a poor action thriller and to long for what it is. In fact if you watched the trailer, you've basically seen the film. It's a complete lack of story that explains why this expensive production from the proficient creator of Speed and Twister sputters out on the high seas. The thing is De Bont remains an expert director of action, but putting the reference to CRUISE control in the title serves as fair warning of an unengaged filmmaker on automatic pilot. Avoid at all costs. If they had to do a sequel, why not set it on a train...it'd be a lot faster",

            "content": "'Die Hard on a bus' and now...yep you guessed it 'Die Hard on a boat', well cruise liner. I guess the first thing that instantly jumps out at you here is the fact the film is called Speed 2 but its on a slow moving cruiser liner!. Hardly speed is it, more like err...cruising, I get the feeling they just wanted to use a cruise ship so they could use their highly imaginative tag of 'cruise control'.\n\nSeriously I've read into this and there were some really decent ideas for a follow up. Nothing original of course, they all copied the exact same premise as the original but at least they could offer up some more thrills than a cruise liner. One plot involved a plane that couldn't ascend above 10,000 feet whilst flying through some mountains, kinda daft but sounds better right?\n\nSo this basically really absolutely is a complete 'Die Hard' rip off, it really is. Recently fired crazy ass Dafoe wants revenge on the company (ships computer systems) that wrongfully terminated him because he was ill. So he decides to sabotage one of his own computer systems on board a large expensive cruise liner and steer it into a disaster whilst pinching all the valuables on board. Again at the end of the day he's just after some jewellery, weak. Its pretty much 'Die Hard/Under Siege' with more comedy and way way less blood and violence, actually check that, there is hardly any blood and violence in this, its bordering on PG territory.\n\nBullock's character has dumped Jack Traven from the first much better film and now she's with the receding hair line of Jason Patric. I guess what's so dumb about this film is firstly Patric just doesn't come across as the hero type, oh sure he's leaping around and trying to be action man every five minutes but the guy just looks anything but. I know heroes don't have to be muscle bound macho men with good hair but Patric? really?? this guy is the wrong kind of actor for a role like this. The other thing that bugs you is the fact his character is such a fudging goodie goodie and always trying to save everyone. Even on board this cruise liner which he knows nothing about, doesn't have a clue where to go and basically shouldn't be poking his nose into anything, he still goes around barking orders at the crew! and they obey him!!! as if!!! in reality they'd tell him to flip off.\n\nBullock is completely sidelined to virtually a cameo really, she does nothing at all other than offer up terrible dialog attempting to be comic relief. She's even more annoying than in the first film and even more wet (situation aside), in fact the badly portrayed passengers are not as annoying as Bullock. Then you have Dafoe as the villain, well I say villain but he isn't really that evil, he merely switches off all the electrics and gets everybody to evacuate. Would stuff on a ship tend to blow up and cause so much destruction when the electrics go down? seems odd.\n\nFunny thing is if everybody had just gotten off as he demanded in the first place, none of the ensuing mess would of occured!...well almost.\n\nI realise Dafoe's baddie character knows the ship inside out and can control whatever he likes but you always get the feeling he's not much of a challenge. Time and again it seems like he could of been caught plus he also comes across as someone Bullock could beat in a fight. His plan also seems very over indulgent simply for stealing some jewels, takes him half the film to get it set up yet takes him fives minutes to do the deed. He then messes around for no real reason when he could of just gotten away no problem, all this kinda makes the action sequences seem unnecessary and forced.\n\nThe film is way more goofy than the first and hardly feels like a real action film at all. There is way too much stupid comedy and idiotic dialog...oh and some awful reoccurring character cameos from the first film which almost make the film into a parody. Even Dafoe's baddie isn't immune to the ridiculous daftness, he contributes with various silly faces to exaggerate the heat of the moment.\n\nThe film does look pretty good I can't deny, the ship interiors, exteriors and various CGI shots are nicely done. This all comes to a head in the finale where De Bont takes the opportunity to destroy half a port town by ramming the cruise liner into it purely to show off lots of destruction and fancy effects/models. Even that doesn't really work though because of the awful comic relief which ruins any real tension. This is the films fault all the way through, you never at any point feel nervous or tense despite the fact you're watching an action film about a hijacking. The whole thing is totally juvenile and not in the least bit exciting, and no sticking Patric on a cool motorbike chase sequence at the start doesn't make him look any cooler, just more out of place.",

She moved on from \"Jack\", the hero of the bus incident whom she hooked up with, and is now dating a new beau, who is also a cop, \"Alex\" (Jason Patric). The two go on a romantic cruise, with the crew mistaking them as a couple on their honeymoon not knowing that \"Alex\" is carrying a ring in his pocket. \r\n\r\nThen it happens. A crazed man (Willem Dafoe), who created the ship's software, hijacks the boat with plans to steal the multi-million dollar jewel collection that is being stored on board. \r\n\r\nNow, \"Alex\" goes in full cop mode, despite being well into international waters and out of his jurisdiction, and tries to stop the maniac's plans, while saving the ship and all those still on board. \r\n\r\nFirst off, the movie lacks the drama that the first film had. In my opinion, the first movie had an equal amount of drama and action. I just didn't feel the drama the first movie had. Also, the action really did not kick in until the last quarter of the movie. Yes, the movie had action through out, but there was just too much breathing room between action sequences in this film. \r\n\r\nThere are some good special effects in this film. Some good explosions, and the water pouring onto the ship. However, the water coming onto the ship has been seen way too many times in other movies with a cruise ship, and is not spectacular. \r\n\r\nAs for the performances in the film, it's not bad. I felt that there was some pretty bad character development with the majority of the supporting cast. Also, there was little chemistry between Bullock and Patric -- there was some, but not enough to make them a really believable couple. Dafoe is a very good madman, but I felt as if he was holding back a bit. \r\n\r\nI would say that this might be a good rental if your first four choices are not available. It's a fine sequel, but not a perfect sequel.",

The cruise ship premise is terrible since cruise ships aren't particularly fast, making each action scene extremely dull. Also, apparently the character Annie seems to gotten quite stupid since the last film, as well as annoying, which left me wishing that she would be thrown overboard. Jason Patric also doesn't do much for the film either since he possesses no charisma whatsoever as an action hero, and whose stupid actions in the film end up killing many innocent people. In fact, the only actor whose performance I liked was Willem Dafoe, who was the only redeeming quality in this shitty action film due to his wonderfully loony performance. Other than him, this film has no redeeming qualities since the plot is retarded, the acting is generally shitty along with the dialogue, the action scenes are spectacularly awful, there is no suspense or character development, and it's also extremely boring and stupid. Speed 2 is one of the worst sequels I've ever seen, and considering the sheer number of hated sequels I've enjoyed, it takes a special kind of shitty sequel to get on my bad side.
