    "summary": "When a car bomb explodes on the American side of the U.S./Mexico border, Mexican drug enforcement agent Miguel Vargas (Charlton Heston) begins his investigation, along with American police captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles). When Vargas begins to suspect that Quinlan and his shady partner, Menzies (Joseph Calleia), are planting evidence to frame an innocent man, his investigations into their possible corruption quickly put himself and his new bride, Susie (Janet Leigh), in jeopardy.",

            "content": "Disappointing. Visually interesting, even ahead of its time, starting off so well with that famous tracking shot. But let down by a superficial plot, uninspired casting, too many superfluous characters (others have mentioned the fortune teller and the utterly bizarre motel guy), and, as nice as the cinematography is, I kept noticing shots where the wrong person was in focus. Most of all though, and I'm probably in a tiny minority here, I think the worst thing about it was Orson Welles. It wasn't a bad performance, but I think he was terribly miscast (by himself). I kept imagining similar, more menacing characters; like Dudley Smith in LA Confidential. A sweaty, mumbling fat guy who looks like he's about to keel over any minute made for an unlikeable villain, but not an effective one.",

How about the three-minute, uninterrupted opening shot, where we follow the street action in a Mexican border town after having seen a bomb being planted on a car.  Or how about the character of Hank Quinlan (Welles), one of the most carefully etched characters ever created by Welles, a repugnant cop willing to break the rules in order to get the desired outcome.  On the downside, Charlton Heston playing a Mexican prosecutor is absurd, the motel scenes with Janet Leigh and Dennis Weaver are embarrassing, and there are a shocking number of characters who seem unnecessary, including Marlene Dietrich as a psychic.  The good outweighs the bad, but not by much.",

The nightman is a second-rate comic relief, all characters are uninteresting with the exception of Quinlan, and the crescendo is too mild.",

This truly is a Tour De France of camerawork with everything from 5 minute long tracking shots, Dutch angles, incredible transitions, intimate close ups, and a range dynamic shots. The choice to shoot this in black white makes every scene much more moody as well and is a phenomenal choice. Without Welles Cinematography there is no doubt in my mind this movie would be good but not incredible. This \"Traditional\" Noir is very unique to me as it is amazing how modern this feels like Neo ones like Chinatown or Pulp Fiction and is a testament to Orson Welles and how much ahead of his time he was going all the way back to Citizen Kane. Terrific Soundtrack with great mixture of musical scores, natural background noise and music playing in the scenery. Very consistent the whole way through and with a complex plot that keeps you guessing.",

            "content": "Universal-International wanted to adapt Whit Masterson's novel Badge of Evil and hired Charlton Heston as the star, Albert Zugsmith as the producer and Paul Monash as the writer.\n\nHeston asked that Orson Welles direct the movie. He joined the project and rewrote the script, appears in the movie and directed the film. He also asked that the actors be part of the process, with Janet Leigh saying, \"We rewrote most of the dialogue, all of us, which was also unusual, and Mr. Welles always wanted our input. It was a collective effort, and there was such a surge of participation, of creativity, of energy. You could feel the pulse growing as we rehearsed. You felt you were inventing something as you went along. Mr. Welles wanted to seize every moment. He didn't want one bland moment. He made you feel you were involved in a wonderful event that was happening before your eyes.\"\n\nLeigh's agent initially rejected the low salary offered without even consulting the actress. Welles sent her a personal letter about\u00a0how much he looked forward to working together. Leigh told her agent that being part of a movie directed by Welles was more important than any money.\n\nWelles also added the racism in the storyline -- Americans racist toward Mexicans, which as you can assume wasn't popular -- and shift in the narrative point of view. He also was very involved in the editing of the movie, working with Edward Curtiss until creative differences caused the editor to be replaced by\u00a0Virgil Vogel. The film was finished by Aaron Stell with Universal locking Welles out, at which point he left to make Don Quixote. Welles was so shocked by the new cut that he wrote a memo explaining how he would edit the film.\n\nUniversal cut fifteen more minutes and ordered reshoots that would be directed by Harry Keller. \u00a0Heston and Leigh were contractually obligated to be in these new scenes, including one that had a stand-in play Welles' character. Heston said, \"I have done worse work in the movies than this day's retakes, but I don't remember feeling worse.\"\n\nAfter eeing a second cut of his film, with scenes he never shot, Welles tried one more time to save the movie with a\u00a058-page note where he outlined how he saw the film working. The studio demanded that Welles attend a dialogue re-record. He refused.\n\nThe film that was released was not the film Welles wanted. It really wasn't the movie anyone wanted. In 1976, UCLA film studies professor Robert Epstein discovered the preview cut in the Universal archives. This 108-minute edit of the film was as close to Welles vision as had ever been seen by the public. The film was re-edited in 1998 using Welles' 58-page memo.\n\nWhat emerged with the re-edits was a movie that was way better than past contemporary reviews would suggest. That said, even the original version won the top two awards at the 1958 Brussels World Film Festival, an event Universal didn't even want to screen the film at. The judges at that event were Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, who made Breathless\u00a0and The 400 Blows\u00a0shortly after.\n\nThe movie begins with a time bomb killing Rudy Linnekar and his girlfriend Zita (Joi Lansing), a crime investigated by Mexican special prosecutor Miguel Vargas (Heston), who is on a honeymoon with his American wife Susie (Leigh). He's soon joined by Captain Hank Quinlan (Welles) and Sergeant Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia), who interrogate -- and plant evidence -- on a man named Sanchez. Vargas suspects that the older policemen have done this before and starts looking into their past.\n\nThis puts the two lawmen against one another, with the stress of the battle finding Quinlan starting to drink after more than a decade sober and using the very criminal he's been investigating, Uncle Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), to not only assault Susie but to make it look like she's using drugs and killed the crime lord.\n\nWelles pushed each actor to doing things beyond what they did before, such as having Dennis Weaver be the opposite of his\u00a0Gunsmoke character, as well as bringing in friends for small parts, including Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Cotton and Mercedes McCambridge, who has the movie's most terrifying line, as the gang surrounds the helpless Susie: \"I wanna watch.\"\n\nTouch of Evil may have taken years to be recognized -- Welles originally hated the film's title but eventually liked it -- but now it's a known classic.",

            "content": "The technical brilliance of Orson Welles is matched only by his creative ingenuity, and Touch of Evil gives us an abundance of both along with one of Welles' most strikingly memorable characters. The seething, uncompromising presence of Captain Quinlan electrifies the screen in a fashion that amuses and stuns in equal measure. Ironic philosophical undercurrents stew beneath the gritty surface of this ambitious work as its desperate characters rail against the fabric of both law and corruption alike. The extended opening sequence is a masterstroke, carrying us along a winding trajectory from intermittently focused and panoramic vantage points, eventually coming to end quite literally in a bang. Despite the obvious cinematic relevance and flashes of greatness apparent here, I can't escape the conviction that this is ultimately a rather flawed and uneven film in need of tightening up. A deliberately histrionic performance by Dennis Weaver leaves us feeling a little awkward, as though catching somebody with their pants down. Likewise, there are vague, protracted motel sequences involving the Leigh character which leave us feeling a little queasy and uncertain about what we're supposed to have witnessed. All things considered, Touch of Evil deserves its place in the pantheon of classic noir, cementing the genre as one that offers both comic and tragic possibilities.",

            "content": "One of the most renowned neo-noir films ever made, and certainly one of my favourites, Touch Of Evil is Orson Welles demonstrating why his near-mythic status in Hollywood is well deserved. Dark and suspenseful without being slow or overly moody, the plot manages to be complex and ever-changing without ever becoming overwhelming, as many twist happy stories tend to do. It's a film about deep-seated corruption and immortality at the heart of the police force, and Welles' Detective Quinlan is one of the most fascinatingly complex characters in film history. His morals are all over the place, but Welles performance makes him feel completely realistic. He comes across as a dedicated officer who works hard to uphold the law, but is not above planting faulty evidence and coercing confessions when he needs a case to be solved. A line of dialogue in the final scene seems to contradict what we've seen and heard about up until that point, and I don't know if it's thrown in to makes things more mysterious, or was simply a result of the botched edit the studio conducted, much to Welles' consternation. Either way, it feels out of place. Charlton Heston also turns in a great performance, though the decision to make his character Mexican is utterly ridiculous in every conceivable way, feeling like a massive misstep in a film that is otherwise solid. I much preferred it to The Third Man, which I found slow and unengaging, and have no problem recommending it to any fan of Neo-noir, Welles, or classic Hollywood cinema.",

Following the case with interest, he's repulsed by the brusque attitude and morally-questionable methods of the local authorities; particularly their notorious lead detective, Quinlan, whose dubious past hangs like a rumbling storm cloud over the whole town.\n\nLike most late-period noir films, Touch of Evil is a wash of pulp and grit, with the seedy subject matter providing a sense of persistent danger and the black-and-white film stock pumped for all the grain and contrast it can muster. Orson Welles, sitting in the director's chair, may have gone overboard in his quest to probe these depths, although post-production on the film wasn't exactly trouble-free and he was eventually ousted from that post en route to a studio-mandated final cut. The result is a jumbled narrative, stocked with far too many loud characters and pointless subplots, albeit one with a stylish, progressive look and feel. Welles is good on the screen (he also plays the shady, multifaceted gumshoe Quinlan), but the double-billing may have been more than he could manage at this stage of his career.",

Doing everything himself, Welles manages to do everything wrong.  Begin with casting.  Orson made the casting selections by himself.  There are many talented actors who could have done an excellent job as Vargas.  True, there could have been worse (like Cary Grant).  The great Charlton Heston, with his tall stature and commanding voice, was an extraordinarily misguided choice for the lead.  Next, 'Film Noir' is characterized by dramatic use of shadows.  Orson pulled out the Klieg lights and reflective pools to produce distracting shadows during nearly every shot, even the daylight scenes.  Shadows can be effective, but they can also be annoying.  Poor acting abounds in this movie, which reflects poorly on both actor and director.  For example, Dennis Weaver has a small role as a motel clerk in one of the most embarrassingly bad scenes in movie history.  The scene itself is entirely unnecessary, playing no part in either plot or character development.  There are too many problems with this movie to address here.  At the time of it's release, the critics panned it. I agree with them.  Just prior to it's release, the studio execs panned it.  I agree.  'A Touch of Evil' is slow, plodding, and pretentious.  But... as it stands... the script has potential for a modern remake.  Hope a talented director picks it up.",

You liked Dutch angles in The Third Man? Well buddy this film has got more Dutch angles than the damn Netherlands. Welles proves he still has it on both sides of the camera, framing beautiful shots and creating a thick and heavy atmosphere while portraying the complex detective (who started out with good intentions but who has subsequently fallen to framing the innocent) with a wonderfully inebriated and bulldog performance that might just be Welles' real personality at this point in his life. This is a film you can watch on repeat and find something new to appreciate each time; the tracking shots are absolutely great, and the film doesn't require massive, detailed setpieces to convey its narrative (especially given that most of the film takes place at night).

Understanding the pull of power, the sway of ambition and the draw of money. The enjoyment intensifies with an understanding of the period they were made; the influences and politics of the time and where the film sits in the director's or the source author's oeuvre. And so all of this leads to my enjoyment and appreciation of the noirs of the past increasing with each watch.\n\nThe effective simplicity of a bomb planted in one country that explodes in another is brilliant, something echoed in modern neo-noir TV, and a great catalyst to see these two worlds smashed together. And Mancini's music drumming along like the ticking of the bomb in a more esoteric and musical way than Zimmer's use of a literal ticking clock in Dunkirk.\n\nThe dialogue is layered and complex and exposition and politics plays amidst action, not unlike modern cinema, and so unlike a lot of film noirs, the film requires you to actually pay attention to the dialogue to get more out of characters that aren't paper-thin and don't have only single-minded goals. There's the use of sumptuous night shooting and outdoor location work and an unrecognisable Wells plays a tragic, disgusting bigot in a self-sabotaging downward spiral that's typically toe-curling to watch.\n\nSo, not being, shall we say, equipped, to satisfactorily enjoy Touch of Evil upon the first few viewings, this time I was fully taken by it. Before, I couldn't understand why it got so much critical acclaim, but in a way it takes a pulpy, noir b-movie premise and loads it with character depth, and racial politics worth talking about, all overseen with a directorial bravado that in a lot of ways, at the close of the 1950's, almost brings a full-stop to the end of Film Noir itself.\n\nGiven the current state of racial politics and The Americas, the unflinching attitudes towards terrorists, surveillance, the attraction to true crime, the sinister and unsettling tone and plot is dying for an HBO/David Simon TV remake, something that transposes the timeless elements to the modern day. Something duly reverential and appropriate.",

It speaks on the United States and Mexico border, police corruption, racism, and justice. What is left of the law is up to you in the end, but Touch of Evil dedicates itself into portraying a distinctly honest depiction of police officers doing their work, whether planting evidence, siding with the white man, or wire tapping. Touch of Evil demonstrates every police activity you can think of and more.\n\nOrson Welles' direction is immaculate, gathering every interesting angle and perspective to enhance his noir aesthetic. The gritty and sweaty look of everything grounds Touch of Evil in a gross realism that can be uncomfortable. Sometimes we need to see the problem as it is before we can deal with it. Touch of Evil is just that as Welles openly critiques the police force for their racist malpractice of all manner.\n\nHis own performance is a damning portrayal as Orson Welles plays the reformed alcoholic American police chief Hank Qunlan. His corruption, deceptive tactics, and outrageous hatred are shocking as much as I was shocked to see how massive Welles became later in his career. He is far removed from his younger handsome days and commanding voice. His stature is beastly and his voice now terrifying. But Welles acts as well and convincingly as his youth. He plays the unfair policeman with a keen sense of direction. It's a sad role as it feels like it could have come out yesterday and still be relevant.\n\nCharlton Heston is surprisingly great as the Mexican policeman Mike Vargas. Heston gives a genuinely empathetic role as Vargas, who must overcome the racist American police department as well as the Mexican organized crime family. Heston is believable as a man that just wants to find the truth and arrive at justice. He is the stalwart example of decency and justice in Touch of Evil.\n\nI really enjoyed seeing Janet Leigh as Vargas' wife Susan. She's completely realistically scared and upset as she is victimized by Quinlan's schemes. You feel particularly bad for Susan because of Leigh's great acting. She comes across as sincere even in the awkward and frightening moments in Touch of Evil.\n\nI thought it was quite neat of Orson Welles to have cast the almighty Marlene Dietrich in a tender supporting role. She casts a mystique and charm as a Mexican fortune teller. You feel her femme fatale and noir tone with every breath and look Dietrich gives. She is gorgeous even as a brunette, but her true talent was her hazy alluring vibe and dreamy persona that she exudes as an actress. \n\nEven Zsa Zsa Gabor makes a quick cameo as a strip club dancer and witness that Orson Welles interrogates for a brief encounter. I recall Joseph Cotten playing a sleazy and director policeman in two short scenes.\n\nIn all, Touch of Evil is a brilliant noir that is worth watching.",

Among other things, you'll see Jane Leigh terrorized in a small roadside motel where she's the only lodger (a couple of years before she'll run into Norman Bates), this time by Mexican gangsters who've come over the border to harass her (and I wish it stopped at that).\n\nOrson Welles is absolutely brilliant as actor and director, and leads a great cast which also includes strong performances from Leigh and Charlton Heston (though I hate the fact that he was cast as a Mexican).  There is a nice small part played by Marlene Dietrich and I really loved how she ended the film, as well a cameo from Zsa Zsa Gabor.  However the biggest reason to watch the film is the way it's shot, which is gorgeous, and decades ahead of its time.  The opening shot sequence alone, fluidly following the action through Mexican streets, is brilliant.\n\nI have to say it was a little hard to follow at times, with the actors talking over one another, which, while more realistic, makes it harder to hear the dialogue.  I was also not wild about a young Dennis Weaver in the role of the kooky night manager.   All in all, though, this is a film definitely worth watching, and definitely shows off Orson Welles' genius.  I also loved this interchange:\n\nHeston: In any free country, the policeman is supposed to enforce the law, and the law protects the guilty.\nWelles: Our job is tough enough.\nHeston: It's supposed to be, it has to be.  The policeman's job is only easy in a police state, that's the whole point, Captain.  Who's the boss, the cop or the law?\n\nIndeed.",

            "content": "There are at least three different stories as to how Orson Welles became the director of \"Touch of Evil\" after an almost ten year absence of making films in Hollywood. One was that over drinks, he had asked producer Albert Zugsmith if he could direct and the producer agreed. The second story was that when the role of Miguel Vargas was offered to Charlton Heston, Heston was told that Welles was to co-star and that no director had been attached to the film yet. Heston recommended Welles should direct the movie. The third, and possibly my personal belief as to what happened, was that Welles was given another chance to work in Hollywood and their studio system once again. To prove how great of a director he was, and he is one of the ten best Classic Hollywood directors, he wanted to make a great film out of the worst script he could find. That script was an adaptation of the Whit Masterson novel \"Badge of Evil.\"\n Welles allegedly rewrote the script and was given sole credit for it. He was also so eager to work in Hollywood again after making a few films in Europe that he only took an acting fee for his work. Before filming there was two weeks of rehearsals, which were unusual in 1957, and during that time, according to actress Janet Leigh who played Suzie Vargas, Welles asked all the actors for their input in helping with the film's dialogue. Welles wrapped up production on time and under budget and showed his cut to Universal. Universal objected and had the film re-edited and some scenes re-shot. The rough cut that Welles submitted to Universal no longer exists (just like his film submitted to RKO Pictures in 1942, \"The Magnificent Ambersons.\" The film had nearly 40 minutes cut from it and without Welles' knowledge, a new, happier ending was filmed). \n There are three versions of the film that exist, the re-edited and re-shot film that included many scenes new to the film. They were directed by Harry Keller. Welles viewed the finished film that was 93 minutes long and made a 58 page memo detailing what he thought needed to be done in order to make the film work. The film ended up not being the film Universal or Welles had imagined and it was largely forgotten as a B-Movie. The film did, however, become quite popular in Europe. The 93 minute film was so confusing that many people had trouble following the plot. In the mid-1970's, Universal discovered they had a 108 minute cut of the film and released it to theaters in 1976 advertising it as \"complete, uncut and restored.\" The film was not, however. Although the longer 1976 version pre-dated the 1958 release version, but post-dated Welles' 58-page memo. The 1976 version contained more Keller scenes than the actual 1958 release.\n Finally, in 1998, Academy Award winning film editor and sound mixer Walter Murch re-edited the film from all available cuts based on the Welles memo. Notable changes included the removal of the credits and Henry Mancini's music from the opening sequence, cross-cutting the main story and Janet Leigh's subplot ad removing Harry Keller's hotel lobby scene. Although, no true \"director's cut\" can or ever will exist, this is the closest to what Welles had intended.\n The film opens on the Mexican side of a border town as a man sets an egg timer attached to a bomb and places inside the trunk of an American couple's car as they drive to the border. The scene is a continuos shot that lasts three minutes and twenty seconds as the car passes newlyweds Miguel (Heston) and Suzie Vargas (Leigh) as they walk to the American side of the border. They stop after passing the border just as the car blows up and goes flying into the air, and that becomes the first cut in the whole film. \n Vargas is a narcotics officer who works in Mexico City and he understands the international ramifications of a bomb being placed in a car on the Mexican side blowing up on the American side and he is there to help local police. The local police is run by Captain Hank Quinlan (Welles), a towering figure whose size and ego exceeds everyone around him. Though Welles was not that big at the time, he used padding and he and cinematographer Russell Matty exaggerate his size by using unique camera angles. Many scenes show the camera looking up at the characters as they argue and shout at one another in many buildings. This same effect was used by Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland in \"Citizen Kane\" to make Charles Foster Kane a larger than life character. Welles' Quinlan is unshaven with stubble on his face, he walks with a limp and mumbles and slurs many words except when he yells. \n Quinlan knows that it was dynamite that blew up the car and when asked how, he claims it's his intuition. That intuition led them to the apartment of the slain man's daughter who is secretly married to a Mexican named Sanchez (Victor Millan) who Quinlan claims stole ten pieces of dynamite from a construction site he recently was fired from. Quinlan maintains that Sanchez's motive is that his wife's father didn't approve of his daughter marrying a Mexican. Vargas is there for the interrogation and uses the restroom knocking over an empty shoebox. Later, Quinlan's best friend and longtime partner Joseph Menzies find two pieces of dynamite in that very same shoebox. Vargas questions Quinlan and accuses him of planting the dynamite there.\n In a subplot, the brother of a man being investigated by Vargas named \"Uncle\" Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff) is having his nephews and members of his drug cartel follow Suzie around. When Menzies picks up Grandi after realizing he was following Vargas' car to a motel on the American side that Menzies was driving, Grandi is taken to meet Quinlan. Grandi meets Quinlan and Vargas and other officers at Sanchez's apartment when the dynamite is found. Upon realizing that Quinlan is also having a problem with Vargas, Grandi offers Quinlan help in getting rid of Vargas.\n As Vargas tries to uncover the truth about Quinlan and reveal his findings to the District Attorney, Quinlan is trying to discredit Vargas and his wife by saying that the two are drug addicts and mixed up in the drug trade that Vargas is supposedly prosecuting. This leads everyone around Quinlan to question his intuition and integrity, and none moreso than his partner and best friend, Menzies.\n The film also features Marlene Dietrich and Joseph Cotton in small roles.\n There is no film quite like \"Touch of Evil\" ever made up to that point. It is considered the last film noir ever made. It is also considered be one of the greatest Orson Welles films ever made and one of the greatest films of all-time. Despite taking a generation or two for its due consideration as a fine piece of cinema. It's magnificent camerawork and direction is no match for many films made at the same time. The fact that the studio system was so hostile to Welles and many other filmmakers whose work would never be seen as the director intended gave rise to the growing interest in restoring many pieces of work of past cinema. Welles' 1966 film \"Chimes at Midnight,\" also known as \"Falstaff\" was produced in Europe and has never fully seen a wide U.S. theatrical release until late last year when Janus announced a restoration of the film. For years, the film was available on VHS and import DVD with bad picture and sound. Hopefully, I and many other fans of Orson Welles will be able to enjoy a film whose legacy grew over time just like \"The Lady from Shanghai\" and \"Touch of Evil.\"",

            "content": "Conventional wisdom is that Kane, Ambersons or Falstaff is Orson Welles' best film, but I think \"Touch of Evil\" deserves to be in this upper echelon of Welles' films. Welles took what would have been a standard crime film about a car bombing investigation along the US/Mexico border and elevated it to art. Welles completely rewrote the script and infuses the story with Shakespearean touches never seen in film noir, particularly Welles own flawed and tragic larger-than-life character, the corrupt police detective Captain Hank Quinlan. Besides the smart Shakespearean storytelling and character touches, in terms of directions, Welles essentially made a French New Wave film within the Hollywood system. Not only does \"Touch of Evil\" fit thematically within the French New Wave with it's social and political context of racism and government corruption along the border, but it also stylistically employs many of the techniques popularized by the new wave, from the famous opening long tracking shot to some nods to jump cuts to the use of handheld camera to an overall rock-and-roll free-wheeling type of wild style (although at the same time Welles' directions seems very precise and deliberate). Regarded as a lesser Welles film when it was initially release, it's slowly, and deservedly, gained respect over the years. When Welles made this film, he'd been forced to make his own films outside of the Hollywood system and this was his first time back in Hollywood as a director for years. Stories vary as to how he got the job, but the most often told one is the it was star Charlton Heston who wanted Welles for the job after he was cast as Hank Quinlan. Henry Mancini's terrific score is also worth mentioning, though his famous theme music was absent from this version because I'd watched the reconstructed version, which was re-edited according to Welles' 58 page memo to the studio after they had re-cut his film prior to it's original release. The main thing that seemed different was the opening long shot which originally had a catchy Mancini Latin score and the title credits, but this version had no title credits and no music, which made the scene incredibly suspenseful, slowly tracking a car the audience just saw a bomb placed in. This film is essential viewing for lovers of classic film, film noir and Welles in particular. This one is a real classic!",

Sure, the camera moves and the shots are elegant and breathtaking and groundbreaking, but it is the way that light is blended in the black and white images that strikes the eye.  A noir that is often hard to follow and perhaps edited too much, this film makes more work of its settings than any other perhaps in cinema history, or at least outside of the Italian Neo-Realist school.  Lines are blurred like borders, rooms become houses of mirrors where five or six characters, crammed into spaces too small for them, blend in and out of the cast shadows and play with moral questions.  \n\nAt the heart of uncertainty lies corruption, because its when humans are lost between good and bad that they, in a sense, go bad.  Here, Welles' gargantuan detective Quinlan seems to have grown fat on the ambiguities of evil, on the lost innocence that pervades the moment when we cross borders and lose ourselves in our desire to do what is right.  \n\nMasterfully shot in black and white, as broad in its philosophical and artistic ambitions as it is narrow in its physical setting, Touch of Evil is a filmmaking textbook.  Sure, Charlton Heston doesn't necessarily work as a Mexican, but Quinlan doesn't work as a bad guy, because, at his heart, like all bad guys, he's good, or at least he wishes that he was good.  This is a manual on how to make more out of less, on how to make a film, not merely shoot a movie.  Though it's cluttered in many places, it never forgets its purpose or its moral orientation.  Janet Leigh tantalizes and Charlton Heston's Ramon steers the film on a steady path, allowing Welles to explore the vulnerabilities and temptations of power, and the spirit of a man defeated.",

If America is represented by the character of Quinlan, it's not hard to see how this kind of film helped to put Welles on the Hollywood blacklist and attracted attention from HUAC.\n \nPolitics aside though, the film stands as a classic late-period Noir. As director, Welles gives a visual masterclass and as an actor, he truly inhabits the large frame of the repugnant but strangely fascinating Quinlan, to the point where you can almost smell the fumes coming out of the screen at you. Paranoia stalks every scene, from the desolate border town to the seedy out-of-town motel, the darkness is palpable in every long shadow cast.",

I can see why people like this as some of the character acting is excellent and the cinematography is amazing. The way he shoots the scenes etc is excellent. gritty, raw and ugly .....In sayin all that though some of the character actin in this was atrocious too .... ie all the Mexican characters who ARENT MEXICAN... not even close. The yobs who hold Vargas's \"rape me\" wife are young white american Jimmy Deane types. I hardly remember seeing any Mexicans in this movie at all. The actor who over acted the shit out of the retard night watch man nearly ruined this movie for me. He played it like it was a farce.... Also the story isnt as strong as the footage. Vargass wife is so annoying. She goes with a group of strange Mexican(haha yea) men to a dodgy house, she throws a lightbulb at a stalker and doesnt mention it to Vargas and she doesnt seem to cop on that the Hotel receptionist is making very threatening and suggestive comments to her over the phone. She has an amazing figure tho... Also the end of this movie drove me mad. Vargas running around trying to record, even running into the river. Such nonsense and then before Hank is even dead Vargas has ran back to his wife in the car and driven off. What shoddy police work. He wasnt so keen to spend time with her when she needed him in the prison cell so surely he'd fuckin wait an extra 20mins till the police got there and how did he know the other guy was dead??? He didnt bother his hole to check... I gave this movie 3.5 stars because it had character and was close to been excellent... had Wells of included some Mexicans and toned down on the farcical nature of it then Id of given it 5. Unfortunately I found it very frustrating at times and silly. It was far better than Citizen Kane tho.",

            "content": "Before starting I think it's important to note which version of this film I watched. The DVD I received was the restoration done based off of Orson Welles' letter to the studio, so it's not exactly the same as the original theatrical release, although I'm not aware where the differences lie. Touch of Evil is the story of a murder that occurs along the border of the US and Mexico. As the police from both sides of the border try to coordinate their investigations we find out just how far the police will go in order to catch the guilty party. I think once you get past the fact that Charlton Heston has been put in brown face and cast as a Mexican this is a really superb cast. Orson Welles plays an ornery and stubborn Police Captain better than anyone. Charlton Heston is great as the pillar of truth and justice in a corrupt system. And Janet Leigh is simultaneously tough as nails when confronted by criminals, and also drop-dead gorgeous. I also should mention how much I loved Joseph Calleia as the Police Sergeant who idolizes his Captain. Of course the other actors all do fine work as well. The most notable thing I can say about this film at the outset, because it took me by surprise, was how dark it got. I'm not talking about visual darkness, although there was a lot of that, but it was fairly violent and downright scary and those moments hold up even to this day.\n\nThe problem is there were several times in Touch of Evil where I was really lost because I couldn't tell which case everyone was working on. Things got muddled because there is the murder that occurs at the opening which I thought was going to be the focus of the whole movie, but then there was another case that Heston's character was going to testify about so he was dealing with a Mexican gang, and then there was suspicion of corruption in the US police which also became a crucial case. It wasn't terrible but I lost the thread of the story a couple of times, which made me lose interest once or twice. However aside from that complaint this movie is evidence that Orson Welles is one of the greatest directors/writers of all time. The way he sets up shots is remarkable, and it all starts with the opening scene which could be the most spectacular one-shot scene ever. It follows in one continuous shot from the moment a bomb is planted to the moment it will explode. What is amazing is how keeping the shot uncut perfectly builds the tension as you are constantly wondering when that time will run out. Another remarkable thing is that they didn't do rear-projection for the driving scenes, but instead had the actors genuinely drive a car with a camera mounted on it, so the shots don't look so artificial. As for great writing, the best example I can come up with is the climax at the end. Welles delivers some lines that are scripted perfectly to fake out the audience and make us think he's saying one thing while he means another. I found myself clinging desperately to every single word hoping he will reveal something and constantly being left hanging. Not to mention how well-planned the shots are in this scene to capture Heston trying to keep pace as Welles wanders down the streets. While I can't say I loved Touch of Evil, I absolutely recognize the quality of the film-making and see that it is a work of art that everyone should try to see at some point.",

It's my third experience with America's most celebrated auteur: after being impressed by Kane and disappointed by Mr Arkadin, I didn't know quite what to expect. To say that Touch of Evil, even cut against Welles' wishes, rivals Kane is to do it a disservice; it is indubitably superior to that much feted but sometimes hollow film. \n\nThe film is best appreciated, in my mind, as a re-invention of Kane through film noir.

The celebrated opening tracking shot of a car containing a time bomb climaxes off-screen, and from here on the film pays relatively little attention to the mystery itself and focuses instead on the characters trying to solve it - rather like Kane, which is less about Rosebud than it is the titular character. The film revolves around the titanic figure of Welles, who in a superb performance takes a noir trope and elevates it to the level of perfect melodrama: Welles plays Captain Hank Quinlan, a corrupt, obese and sometimes drunken cop who fabricates evidence in order to justify his instincts regarding criminal guilt, with such incredible ease and naturalness that I am tempted to think that he was drunk on set. Although the flat characters and uninspired performances of Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh pale in comparison to Welles, some of the supporting cast deliver similarly entertaining, if not quite bravura, performances. This is true of the Mexicans in the film generally and Akim Tamiroff, as the colourful-cum-caricatured gangster Joe Grandi, in particular. \n\nIf the cast make the film's tried-and-tested plot more entertaining, then it is Welles' incredible direction which makes the film so memorable long after the final searing images of Quinlan's corpse floating in a dirty river - while Marlene Dietrich delivers a laconic epithet - have left the screen. In many ways, this final scene encapsulates what is so wonderful about Touch of Evil: Welles has taken a tired premise riddled with clich\u00e9s and shot everything with such technical mastery that it elevates the material. Even though Dietrich's \"he was some kind of a man\" is standard noir fare, it comes off as less generic in light of the rather spectacular build up to the film's finale: a bugged conversation between Quinlan and his long-time partner Menzies, who wears the wire for Mexican official Vargas (Heston) who wishes to out Quinlan's corruption and uses Menzies to secure a confession, in which Welles constructs a sequence consisting mostly of elaborate, tense shots in which both Quinlan and Menzies are visible alongside Vargas with his radio, with each duo occupying fore and background at various intervals. Accompanying this, and no doubt influenced by Welles' background in the theatre, is the impressive use of diegetic sound. Whenever Vargas and his radio occupy the foreground, we hear the dialogue as though through the radio. Welles flips back and forth between this and more conventional audio in the Quinlan/Menzies sequences until a climactic moment on a bridge when both of these diegetic sounds clash: Quinlan speaks, and Vargas' radio, located under the bridge, echoes his words so that he can hear them. This climax represents the peak of Welles' generally expressive use of cinematography throughout the film, such as filming through mirrors or from odd angles. \n\nI have not yet touched on the thematic and moral boundaries which Touch of Evil flits between, as befitting a film which opens with a quibble about jurisdiction on the US-Mexico border, and nor do I feel the need to. Certainly they are shocking and provocative, but it is the richness of the cinematic expression (coupled with a colourful dramatic direction) Welles gives the noir which makes this such a memorable filmic experience.",

I'd seen the film before of course, but this time I felt more satisfied with it.\n   This film's camerawork is so perfect that only Max Ophuls could handle it, and it covers so much ground story-wise that only Hitchcock could handle, but only Welles could handle both with such ease, and maintain a large sense of humor, a powerfully dark visual style, and everything else Welles stands for. One of my top 15 films of all time. It isn't the powerhouse brilliance and the mysterious perfection of Citizen Kane, but certainly just as essential.",

            "content": "One of the rare post-Citizen Kane films that Orson Welles directed that he actually managed to finished, Touch of Evil faced edits and compromises from its completion to well beyond its initial release (as a B-movie, whose sordid traditions the film embraces while simultaneously elevating). Despite the obstacles, the film remains a landmark noir in its restored DVD version at least, which was based on Welles' detailed notes to Universal concerning his editing preferences.\n\nIf Touch of Evil is not quite on the level of 1940s genre high-water-marks like The Maltese Falcon or The Third Man, the latter which Welles starred in (though did not write or direct), then the major factors in its falling short have to be the plot's reliance on sensationalist exploitation material and the thoughtless racial offensiveness inherent to studio-period Hollywood. Set along the Mexican border in brothels, remote motels, and looming oil fields, the narrative involves a car-bomb murder, drug hysteria, and rampant police corruption. Starring Charlton Heston as a Mexican drug enforcement official (his skin is darkened by makeup, but his Spanish is at least impeccable) on a honeymoon with his blond American wife (Janet Leigh) who becomes embroiled in a crooked murder investigation conducted by a crusty immensity of a police captain (Welles himself, in a role of minimal vanity), the film has far more visual interest on offer than it does compelling content.\n\nShadows dance on backlit brick walls, ceiling fans rattle, and even in black-and-white you can feel the sickly glow of the neon signs of moral indulgence. The famed single-shot opening sequence is a marvel, the camera swooping over roofs and across dusty boulevards, following Heston and Leigh and the soon-to-be-bombed convertible to their dramatic convergence. It is bookended by the closing pursuit beneath oil derricks and junk piles to a stone bridge, where Welles' Captain Quinlan clings to his robe of lies to the last breath. The villainous Quinlan's introduction is classic Welles: chomping a cigar while exiting a car, he's shot from below, his size and menace masterfully emphasized.\n\nEven if Welles displays his usual artist's eye, as well as the maverick's button-pushing disdain for the studio Code's censorship (check Grandi's phallic cigar thrust in Leigh's face in their initial meeting), he forces the edgy material too hard. The \"reefer madness\" sequence in the motel seems fairly ludicrous to modern eyes, and holds little of the threat it is meant to. Beyond the queasiness of the Latin-washed Heston (intoning his lines with the varnish of wooden authority and even losing his shirt once or twice to expose his stone-slab abs), the other major Mexican character, the execrable Grandi, is played by a Russian-born Armenian (Akim Tamiroff). Leigh vamps in her undergarments and shows some moxie in the aforementioned face-off with Grandi, but is given little to do beyond the first act but be a damsel in distress. Marlene Dietrich is in the mix, too, though one can barely fathom why.\n\nDespite its considerable stylistic quality and technical proficiency, maybe Touch of Evil loses points for its dirty, leering soul, a too-literal embodiment of its themes of official corruption and moral compromise. Or maybe it's just too much of its time, neutered by the Code, overwrought by its creator, and saddled by its poor studio-mandated choice of male lead. But the film's touch is hardly nimble enough to overcome such burdens, even if its director overcame many to get it made and (belatedly) released in a form he mostly could have approved of. A genre classic? Surely. A masterpiece? Let's not get carried away here.",

Although recut by the studio (including having another director shoot new scenes) this version contains a recut according to Welles' vision outlined in a letter unearthed in latter years by star Heston.

The cinematography is amazing, as is the pacing, and the casting is odd but superb (exception being Charlton Heston as a Mexican, who is just playing himself), as Janet Leigh and Orson himself dominate the story. Small parts by Zsa Zsa Gabor,  Marlene Dietrich (as 'ladies of the night')  and Dennis Weaver as the mentally retarded Motel nightman, are great dressing to this, and are surprising considering how dark this material is. Orson playing a sweaty, depraved and racist detective at the Mexican border, is cutting corners to solve a case, risking race relations and the careers of himself and his whole department. Very suspenseful, wonderfully shot and framed and smartly edited, this is a fine example of Welles at his most indulged (even today, there are not many films where the scenes across the opening 10 minutes are one continuous take).

Ultimately, however, it was Orson Welles as the brutally and sadistically corrupt Hank Quinlan that really caught me. Janet Leigh is also awesome as Vargas' wife, as are the cameos of screen legends Marlene Dietrich (\"He was some kind of a man. What does it matter what you say about people?\") and Zsa Zsa Gabor. In the end, Touch of Evil does leave us with a message loud and clear, a valuable lesson in the fields of integrity, duty, honor and friendship.

In this case, an angry and corrupt police chief named Hank Quinlan played Orson Welles, who never fails to blend in seamlessly into his movies. The Mexican border is the perfect back drop for this type of accused scandal, and when a Mexican born policeman named Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) investigates an \"accident\" involcing dynamite and a dirty group of Meixcan thugs, he unravels a scandalous plot to put him and his wife (Janet Leigh) down or away for life from the Mexican gangsters that rival the harsh law of Hank Quinaln.\n\nIt's a brilliant set up, and not your ordinary film-noir. While we follow Vargas and his investigation with Quinlan we can be led to believe that the events of the movie will wrap up nicely and assailant will be caught. But like how Welles weaves us through a fascinating mystery similar to the meaning of \"Rosebud\" in \"Citizen Kane,\" he does the same here. Directing and starring in the film, Welles cradles it like a mother cradling a newborn baby. Welles never seems to stray from our consciousness in the picture. Even when his character isn't present the mention of his name offers a remembrance of the brilliant performance he gives. Add to the this the fluid camera angles he gets and beautifully shot dark lighting to make the film seem mysterious and intrigueing. The film's pacing never slows and the story always seems to have your attention.\n\n Like Hitchock's later film \"Psycho\" (in which Janet Leigh would eventually star in) \"Touch of Evil\" examines the workings and function of the human mind. How we can test and decipher what may go wrong and how it may in the worst possible way. Ambiguity is present, as at first we believe the Mexican gangster 'Uncle' Joe Grandi to be the main cause of everything, we  learn there is a much more powerful yet corrupt force at hand; manipulating both side of the border to his advantage. In a town where secrets are kept and little is revealed, an evil deed for anyone is just a touch away.",

            "content": "Much like Detective Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles), Welles himself can be seen as a man trying to do the greater good but due to character flaws failing to accomplish what he sets out to do.  Welles is a master of the cinematic form and a film like TOUCH OF EVIL (Welles, 1958) captures all of his brilliance and ambition.  But like Quinlan, Welles falls short in the pantheon of great filmmakers because he refused to do it any other way then his way, to his detriment.  \n\nFrom the very opening shot of the film, the three and one half minutes of an uninterrupted tracking shot you know you are about to see some visually special.  Remember, this film came out in 1958, and he opened with a three and one half minute shot.  No cuts, just straight filming.  An incredible achievement, one later copied by many, most notably Scorsese and PTA.  The cinematography for the film is excellent.  Black and white, allowing for a broader array of contrasts, the dichotomy between light and dark portrays the struggle between good and evil.  This speaks for the film but particularly for Quinlan, as this detective slides along a murky line between doing his job the right way or fabricating evidence to attain arrest.  For the film as a whole, the contrast serves to guide the viewer and remind us that bad things are happening in a good world.\n\nAlso serving to remind the audience of the dichotomy of this world is the continual camera placement by Welles in an oft centered way.  The camera is repeatedly oft kilter, emphasizing that something within the films narrative and world is wrong.  The camera is often placed at a low angle, particularly when shooting Quinlan and his fellow officers.  This serves to give Quinlan a God-like appearance, as we are always gazing up at Quinlan and his officers.  This God-like appearance of the police speaks to a larger, more contemporary issue today's audiences deal with.\n\nThat issue, among others in the film is one of police culpability and responsibility.   We place an inordinate amount of pressure on our police to keep us safe yet restrict their abilities to accomplish their job.  The film touches on this very topic.  Quinlan knows who has placed the bomb in the car for the original crime, yet he doesn't have the evidence.  So he manufactures it, crossing a line.  That and his reliance on brutal tactics place Quinlan squarely in line with modern police.  The film also touches on the beginnings of contemporary issues such as drugs and gangs and the symbiotic relationship between the two.  I think it would be great to be able to go back to the writing of this film and see juts how much they wanted to comment on these issues in a broader sense.\n\nTo go back and meet the classical stars of this work would be nothing short of amazing.  Never lauded as \"great\" actors, both Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh both are stars.  Acting has become so good that often people confuse the fact that those in the movies are stars and people pay to see stars.  Such is the case for Heston and Leigh.  And there is no bigger star in this film than Marlene Dietrich.  Still stunningly beautiful and seductive at filming (she was 57), Dietrich embodies everything that film stars used to be.  Welles too is a master, having that distinct ability to portray faults of a character and to be willing to have his audience loathe his character.  Truly a master at work.\n\nTOUCH OF EVIL is a classic, pure technical accomplishment, performance oriented and socially driven.  Worth viewing again and again.",

Now about that opening tracking shot, it's fantastic. What's that word for something that blows your mind?... Ah, I'm sure I'll think of it later, but that's what this shot is, mind-fellatio, no that's not it. It's not great just because it's super long, it's not great just because it's super complex, no it's great because it establishes the movie. Without its opening shot Touch of Evil would be a mess: mystery, horror, comedy, noir, psychoanalysis, romance. It's that shot, and the fact that it introduces all of these genres, and  builds up a relationship to the main characters, that sells the picture. \r\n\r\nPlus, Orson Welles was born to play a corrupt cop, and that scene with the gang of thugs harassing Janet Leigh in her motel room is terrifying, and Marlene Dietrich is in it. \r\n\r\nIt may not always be perfect, again I cite Charlton Heston as a Mexican (Charlton Heston as a Mexican, that's like casting Lassie as the Taco Bell Chihuahua),  but it can be pretty darn good.",

Orson was past forty, and still had not made a hit since \"Citizen Kane\". Shockingly enough, this wasn't a success either, making it seem like OW was a one-hit wonder... well, to people in the Golden Age. Now, this is considered his second best to \"Citizen\". I still haven't seen CK, but I can tell you this much-- this is a must-see movie! Every actor shines here, and makes the most of their roles, which as you all know (if you read my reviews) is something I love to see! Charlton Heston was past \"The Ten Commandments\" and proved that even after doing a major film he could step down to a lesser, more dramatic role. He's great, and though he seems like a weird one to put in a gritty movie like this, it turns out its not. Janet Leigh is pre- \"Psycho\" in this one. Yes, her role is similar to the latter, but does that really matter? Every one loved her, and plus, she doesn't even get murdered this time! A Bonus! She isn't a femme fatale in this, but it seems like with every film noir you get, the woman is always a \"ff\" or a damsel in distress, and she's the second one. Though her role is not new to anyone, she still does a great job and the movie would not be the same without her. These two actors were wonderful, it's Welles that steals the show. Yes, Welles, the director and writer of this film to top it all off. I'm not sure if he gained weight for this role or not, but his character of the hard-edged fatty cop is really good, and makes an awesome villainous turn. This movie belongs to him, which is not a surprise in any way. \"Touch of Evil\" is the perfect movie, and is something that is seriously worth seeing.",

            "content": "The last feature film brilliant Hollywood legend, Orson Welles, directed. Touch of Evil is a spectacular feat of intence and masterful filmmaking, stunning cinematography and a brilliant cast. Too bad the story is half asked noir.\r\n\r\nIt begins with a 3:20 minute shot of following a car with a bomb inside. What follows after is mystery, lies, and murder. When the car explodes near the boarder between America and Mexico 2 policemen follow the case: Mike Vargas, Mexican drug enforcement officer, and a legendary and troubled police captain, Hank Quinland. Vargas and Quinland clash over Quinland's prejudice and questionable investigation procedures. When Vargas goes his own way on the mystery he discovers a secret that puts him and his wife's life in danger. Touch of Evil is a very pulp fiction-esque thriller, dealing with murder and drugs all wraped in a conspiracy. We have a twist on cliches having a Mexican (played greatly by Charlton Heston) as our hero and the American police enforcement as the corrupted. And not to mention a disturbing thought of the trauma done to Vargas's wife, played also wonderfully by Janet Leigh. But it's the veterain himself, Orson Welles who steals the show with his uncommon and revolutionary style of acting. But for all this movie had going for it, this is just me talking here, but the story was unoriginal and flat. Though told very suspencfully and with very wonderful moments and quotes, I just couldn't get over how unoriginal, simple, and frankly unexplained the story turns out to be.\r\n\r\nAll praise to Orson Welles. He may have a reputation of being a crazy ass director, but it's his crazy style that makes his movies BRILLIANT. And Touch of Evil may just be his best efforts yet. There is not one sigle normal shot in the entire movie. Every frame has an awkward camera angle, incredibly creative lighting, or very symbolic and memorable image. Welles goes all out making this movie, full of continuous shots and incredible uses of camera angles and lenses. As a matter of fact, as bloated as Welles looks in this movie, it's actually Welles' choice of cinematography and his own brilliant acting that gave the illusion of him being a larger man. Hands down this is one of the best directed movies I've seen. And it definitely makes a weak story seem a hell of a lot more exciting than it really is. And this movie's music is also composed by the one and only, Henry Mancini which I found surprising.\r\n\r\nIt may have been a flop, but Touch of Evil is still remembered today as an incredible accompishment of filmmaking style that only Orson Welles could provide. The story to me has aged a large some since then being not as climactic as it could have been, but let us not forget the artistic style that Touch of Evil has inspired over the years.",

I olny have minor remarks about the very end. Apart from that, this is great filmmaking that wil survive for centuries\n\nPete Menzies: You're a killer.\nHank Quinlan: Partly.

The famous long takes - the opening shot must be the most famous in the history of cinema - are of the most crystallized brilliance, but in the mood of this hallucinatory nightmare world the striking editing, the dutch angels, the lens choices and sound design play perhaps even more significant role. The characters around the heroic couple are of this world - and the film's sense of humour embodies itself in the weird nightman of the motel - but the film's center is dominated by Orson Welles's magnificient Detective Hank Quinlan, one of the most memorable characters of the silver screen.

And yet, in this movie, casting Hesston in the role of a Mexican narcotics agent actually works.  But on reflection, how could it not, considering that Touch of Evil was made by Orson Welles himself.\r\n\tWelles is, after all, the man responsible for Citizen Cane.  Hearing that he's connected with a project tends to raise expectations- especially when he both stars and directs.  And Touch of Evil more than meets them.  Here we have a web of lies and conspiracy that keeps you guessing, rapidly building tension in the second half, and two legendary actors giving some of the best performances of their careers.\r\n\tHesston plays Vargas, who along with his American wife is celebrating his success on his last case.  Their border vacation is cut short when the car ahead of them explodes in a massive fireball.  Every law enforcement officer in the county is soon on the scene, including Captain Quinlen (Welles).  He makes it clear from the start that he doesn't want some Mexican getting involved in his affairs, but the bomb was planted in Mexico, probably by a Mexican.  Plus, Vargas may have more personal reasons for sticking around, possibly involving the local crime boss.  It's clear that these two will but heads and work at cross purposes all through the case. But when Vargas that Quinlen may be planting evidence, the film takes a whole new direction.  Both men's reputations are at stake, and there will be no holds barred.\r\n\tFor those of you still reading, I cannot fully express just how great Welles' screenplay is.  Rarely, if ever, predictable, it keeps you guessing as to the characters' intentions, motivations, and connections to each other.  Deals are made and loyalties shift, with the other characters- and the viewers- only gradually becoming aware of what's really happening.  It also must be said that nothing, absolutely nothing happens that does not tie back in to the plot.  There are no fillers here.  And at the end, everything is explained, and all the loose ends tied up, without resorting to any Deos ex Machina devices.\r\n\tBack to Charlton Hesston.  If his name had not been in the opening credits, I would never have guessed that it was him.  He looks nothing like himself; he looks Hispanic.  This film must have had one hell of a head makeup artist.  Of course, the fact that it's in black and white doesn't hurt.  I doubt this would work nearly as well in color. And yet it's not just his appearance.  He speaks Spanish like a native, and has the subtle hand gestures down pat.  The only thing that leads one to suspect he's white is  that he also speaks English like a native- that is to say without a noticeable accent. But as convincing in his portrayal as Hesston is, his is only the second best performance in this picture.\r\nWarning! Major spoilers ahead!\r\n\tBesides providing excellent writing and direction, Welles also gives us one of the most loathsome characters in the history of cinema. Physically he's overweight, with a homely visage.  His movements are slow and plodding, and his voice a low growl mixed with a smoker's cough.  From the moment we first meet him, it's obvious that he's a racist and a bigot.  It also becomes clear as the movie progresses that he is seriously corrupt, to the point that his career and the reputation he's built for himself are based on blatantly illegal acts, acts which have led to the deaths of possibly innocent people. \r\nFor Quinlen, his job isn't about seeing justice done OR following the letter of the law.  It's only about clearing the books and seeing that someone is punished.  And he will do anything, no matter how unspeakable to keep his sterling reputation intact.  And it doesn't matter how long or how loyally you've served him, he only cares about himself.\r\nThe final scene, with the wiretap, is an absolute masterpiece of high tension.  At every second, the hero is threatened with discovery.  Quinlen is a smart man, even drunk.  The conversation between him and the sergeant can only go on so long before he realizes he's being set up.  We know this, and the question becomes \"Can Vargas keep him in the dark long enough to get what he needs?\" When this question is answered, the final confrontation is masterfully handled.  It is upstaged only by the coda, in which the original case is solved, and we discover just how pointless all of Quinlen's schemes were.",

There's melodrama of course. It is 1958 after all and you can't help but love Denis Weavers totally over the top part as the jittery hotel manager. .  But in saying that there's nothing but impeccable acting and characterization from Welles. Its fascinating to watch Marlene Dietrichs small part as well.

Welles is making a point with this film:  it is hard to firmly establish and justify stereotypical views, as all human beings are capable of actions that would prove to be both deserving and non-deserving of such views. \n\nWelles's character, Quinlan, is a perfect example of this; his gruff tone, racist remarks, and imposing physical presence make us immediately label him as someone who is up to no good \u00e2\" a label that proves to be well founded at first, but challenged later. \n\nThe characterization of Vargas is another example of how Welles challenges stereotypes, especially when comparing Vargas to Quinlan. Here, the hero of the story is Mexican, while the villain is a white, Italian-American. \nVargas is the only non-stereotypically portrayed Mexican in the film, as he is the only law-abiding Mexican. Quinlan, on the other hand, plays by his own rules and does not abide by a strict moral code, despite being a detective.  \"Touch of Evil reverses these stereotypes, yet the film does not do this in order to bluntly stand against them.  Instead, it comments on how it is difficult to establish stereotypes, and leaves the viewer to decide the rest for themselves.  Right and wrong are not always comparable to black and white. Sometimes there is a mixture of the two \u00e2\" a blurred line, a border.  Hence, the film\u00e2(TM)s setting.\n\nThe line delivered by Marlene Dietrich brilliantly closes the film and encompasses its meaning: \"He was some kind of man.  What does it matter what you say about people?\"",

It takes place in 24 hours and it concerns the investigation of a car bombing that soon turns into a man's quest to expose a hard-as-nails police captain (Orson Welles) for the phony he is. The cinematography is superb, the acting is nice (finally get to hear some Spanish in an American film from this time - and Heston did throw in some authenticity as Meixcan DEA agent Mike Vargas), the script is occasionally witty (some barbs to Welles' past projects, most notable the cane his character walks around with), and the direction (even with the conventional Harry Keller material) is just godly.\n\nWatch this film now.

No film after this ever captured the suspense or reached the height of the great art direction in the genre. This is also one of Welles' best films, along with his other master work Citizen Kane.\n\nThis is a story of murder, kidnapping and police corruption taking place in a stark environment in a Mexican border town. The honeymoon of Ramon \"Mike\" Vargas (Charlton Heston) with his new wife Susan (Janet Leigh) is suddenly interrupted when a bomb in planted in a car in Mexico, but explodes over the border in America. On the scene is fat, aged and corrupt detective Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) who will do anything to break a case. Through an inventive script and the sheer atmosphere of the film it is clear which characters are bad and which are good; it all leads to a terrifying climax. Welles gives a great performance as the intimidating and racist detective; he ends up looking about 20 years older than his age at the time. There's also a fun turn from a young Dennis Weaver as the Motel Night Manager.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a masterpiece from the great Orson Welles; its setting and sensational acting ensure it's one of the greatest film noirs of all time.",

I still have to come to terms with the so-called masterpiece \u00e2Citizen Kane\u00e2\u009d (didn't have the courage yet to watch it again), which I didn't like much when I first set eyes on it. \u00e2Touch of Evil\u00e2\u009d was a similar experience: this movie is generally held in high regard, but I think it is overrated. Admittedly, the second half of the movie is better than the first. In the beginning, the action and the story in general are muddled and intransparent: one hasn't a clue what Vargas (Charlton Heston) and his wife Susan (Janet Leigh) are doing in the American/Mexican border village and why the wife is being threatened by the Grandi clan. OK, the honeymoon scenario soon comes to the surface, but the threats are unclear, especially since they begin before Vargas starts sticking his nose into affairs that he had better stayed away from. The beginning of the movie is wrong-footing: one thinks one is going to watch a regular crime movie with Vargas helping the regular (honest) police force in solving it, but gets in trouble with the local gangsters who already knew him and decide to frighten his new wife as a sort of pre-emptive strike. After a while, one discovers it is not so, and the truth is way more scary than that. Moreover, it is not until the second half that we are presented with the appropriate ominous atmosphere. The first half contains too many silly elements, which make you smile rather than shiver (mainly because of the unserious nature of some of the characters and the dialogues). In the second half, the going gets tough, the masks fall off and the horror emerges. In addition, the photography gets more artistic. I particularly liked the use of darkness and light and shots like that of the murdered Mexican in the hotelroom (almost like the face of a puppet). The eavesdropping sequence is interesting too (especially with the echo effects). So in the end, this film noir proves worthwhile, but it needs some time to get going.",

And that's a pity. Maybe the film would have been more enjoyable (at least based on today's standards) if the Mexicans weren't all shown as ridiculous idiots or if the Mexican main character would have actually been PLAYED by a Mexican actor (and not by Heston).\r\nOn the other hand, this film also looks very old (which is obviously not very good).

Sometimes it seems as if the only reason of the film would be to show that they had dollies back then... lol...\r\nI don't know... but if Citizen Kane is as boring as this movie... well...

This classic masterpiece would be worth seeing just for Orson Wells's spellbinding performance as the tremendously obese Hank Quinlan, a murderous, corrupt, bigoted police captain who frames a Mexican youth as part of an intricate criminal plot. Charlton Heston superbly plays Ramon Vargas, an honorable Mexican-born narcotics investigator who agrees to investigate a car bombing murder of a rich American and his young girlfriend at the border crossing, and in doing so incurs the wrath of the monstrous Quinlan, Vargas discovers that the young Mexican has been set-up and is out to prove the kid's innocence and Quinlan's guilt; but Quinlan is way ahead of Vargas and is already framing Vargas as a drug addict along with his beautiful wife Susan, played wonderfully by Janet Leigh to discredit him with his superiors, all this cat and mouse play will lead to an unforgettable and deadly finale between the straight, incorruptible Vargas and the the tainted, wicked  Quinlan. Flawless direction by Orson Wells who creates a brilliant cinematic work of expressionistic  genius. Remarkable supporting performances by Akim Tamiroff, Joseph Calleia, Joseph Calleia, Joanna Cook Moore and Dennis Weaver. Special Kudos to the sultry Marlene Dietrich for her compelling turn as Tanya, a gypsy madam who delivers the film's memorable closing words. But it is Orson Well's Phenomenal portrayal of Quinlan, a bloated behemoth of a man, bigger than life, decadent, cigar clenched between his teeth, unshaven face,  with small glassily eyes revealing a \"touch of evil\" who completely steals this motion picture. Extraordinary shadow-laden cinematography by Russell Metty and a superlative original score by Henry Mancini.  One of the all time great films.  Highly Recommended.",

            "content": "An iconic, misanthropic, film noir, \"Touch of Evil\" is one of Orson Welles' last Hollywood ventures and one of his best and critically received films of all time. Welles has his memorable directing style, choice of mis-en-scene, and elaborate choices in acting covering this film from top to bottom. From the bleak atmosphere, to the dark and seedy undercurrent of violence in the police department, to the cultural differences between Mexico and America on a border town, every choice in this film is magnificent. Welles also made the interesting choice to make all the music used within the film diegetic, so it plays from radios and passing cars, and not from a score. Even the plot of the film seems strangely unordinary, as it starts as an explosive (literally) investigation into a car bombing. It quickly becomes clear that the rather robust Hank Quinlan (Welles) is a culprit in the framing of a Mexican youth, and Mexican narcotics' agent Vargas (Heston) has to play a decadent game of cat and mouse in order to save his new wife Susan (Leigh) and entrap Quinlan. Every role in this film feels like a piece of a puzzle that fits together with glue like accuracy. Welles wore padding and prosthetics to play the bull-figure that he would ultimately become, and the transformation makes his gluttonous behavior seem less than coincidental with his end game. Heston, though out of his depth as a Mexican and miscast by a mile, does a convincing job of being the hero without reigning down moralistic virtues as he does in former films. Leigh is a little too agog at the world of crime for her performance to be anything but bothersome, yet she does stand up for her husband at every turn. There are many side performances that would make anyone squeal with glee, including Dennis Weaver (\"Gunsmoke\") as a hotel manager, Zsa Zsa Gabor as a strip club owner, and Marlene Dietrich as a gypsy madame who falls into sympathy for Quinlan, though strangely she isn't the only one who does so. Welles, as a visionary director, does some interesting things with a pulpy noir that make it resemble an art house thriller more than anything, and does so with little background noise to complicate things, something very few directors have been able to replicate.",

Orson Welles demonstrates his directing genius, though the even-more-brilliant Citizen Kane would already have been proof of that.  The camera angles, the lighting, the pacing, it is all perfect.\n\nAs in Citizen Kane, he acts in his own movie, and does an amazing job.  His performance as the crooked police captain Hank Quinlan is one of the great portrayals of a villain in cinematic history.\n\nThe script (which Orson Welles wrote, adapted from a book) is a bit weak at times, though, and some scenes just don't gel completely.  In addition, Charlton Heston was miscast.  The role needed a good dramatic actor, not a one-dimensional action actor.  Fortunately his presence is overshadowed by that of Welles, and the stunning Janet Leigh.\n\nThe cast is also interesting for the appearances of Dennis Weaver, Marlene Dietrich and Zsa Zsa Gabor.\n\nA classic amongst thrillers.",

If you enjoy crime dramas, then rent this film. Some great one-liners, and some amazing camera shots included as well, all in black and white. And then there's Orson Welles' fat, used-up detective, back on the bottle, sitting in the fortune teller's parlor under the trophy head of a bull killed in a bull fight, and listening to a player piano. Do you think there's some symbolism there, maybe? I'm thinking...yes.",

I love long scenes like this and it was the perfect way to catch my interest, even during the open credits, just waiting for an explosion!  It was a struggle the entire movie to accept that I was watching Orson Welles - he looked SLIGHTLY different than he did in Citizen Kane.  But regardless of appearance, he still delivers a performance filled with intensity and emotion, furthering his status as one of the greatest actors of all time.  Charleton Heston portrays his role with riveting intensity as he searches for the guilty party while encountering the corrupt police force.  The runtime of this movie is the perfect length to introduce the conflict, develop the characters, and wrap it up in the end.  Most importantly, you'll really feel your emotions flaring up when you watch the harassment of Janet Leigh and planting of false evidence.",

But when thrown into such a bizarre story, this circus of performers seem to hit enough right notes to make things work.
