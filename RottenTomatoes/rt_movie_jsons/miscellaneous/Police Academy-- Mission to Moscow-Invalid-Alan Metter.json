As a result, a staggering number of robberies have been committed, and the Russian police have no leads. They call in the help of the Americans -- but think twice about that decision when they end up with the lovable, bumbling members of the Police Academy, including Eric Lassard (George Gaynes) and Thaddeus Harris (G.W. Bailey).",

I'm surprised they didn't shift the genre from comedy to horror by this time (don't oversaturated horror franchises usually become intentional comedies by the fourth or fifth entry?). The plot is lacking, the jokes aren't very funny, the cast has their talents gone to waste (Christopher Lee and Ron Perlman? What the hell are you two doing here?), the characters aren't all that compelling - not even those who stuck around since day one - and there's absolutely no enthusiasm or effort in the direction or screenwriting. And thus, it was with little surprise, that the Police Academy franchise was put down as Warner Bros. opted to move on to other, more profitable and more narratively superior franchises.",

When the film came out the trailers decide to talk extensively about the Cold War which is strange advertising for a comedy and when audiences saw that the Police Academy were in Russia they knew to stay away because it is just too ridiculous. It relies on too much slapstick which even for a Police Academy movie is saying something. It is way too predictable and it is a shame they ended a fun comedy franchise on such a bad comedy. The premise having the academy set in Moscow, Russia sounds creative but the result is just ridiculous enough to not make you enjoy it.",

The story is ridiculously awful and doesn't make a bit of sense.

The news reporter on TV is playing with a Gameboy (I think), apparently playing a new popular game. On closer inspection, as we get close ups, you notice there isn't actually a game cart in the back of the GB, utter fail in the first five minutes.\n\nThe plot kinda sounds OK when you think about it, the Russian mafia laundering money under the guise of a highly addictive and popular videogame. The bad guys use this game to be able to hack into any computer system it has been played on, hence they are able to commit many crimes. So Lassard and his best men are brought in to bring down this Russian gang led by a well cast Perlman.\n\nThe cast for this final outing is sparse, we still have Tackleberry, Jones, Callahan, and Harris, but we are missing many of the regular officers such as Hightower, Hooks, Proctor, Fackler, Nick Lassard and of course old Mahoney. This time without Nick Lassard as the Mahoney replacement, we have another replacement, this time for Nick Lassard! This new recruit looks like a young Matt McCoy (Nick Lassard) but has none of the charm, I'm not even sure why he's in the film really as he pretty much does nothing.\n\nThat is the whole problem with this film, nothing actually happens. There aren't really any pranks, not many laughs, no training sequences (thank god) and not much plot excitement. There is one amusing sequence where Harris and Tackleberry join in on a Russian ballet performance in full get up, but that's about it really. There are some silly acrobatics from some Russian cops that seem to be mute, a mediocre car chase and a small hint of humour. Not even Harris or his Russian equivalent can help this film.\n\nUnfortunately its a poor exit for the franchise with this final film, the last film was quite good at times but this is really dull and not at all visually exciting, its all filmed on location in Russia but it looks grim. Cultural differences are of course used but none of it really works, its just not funny. The fact that Cmdt. Lassard spends half the film AWOL with a Russian family merely by accident just seemed like the writers had no idea what to do with him, he's virtually a cameo. Quick mention for Christopher Lee who looks quite good as the Russian Cmdt. but I have to wonder why he agreed to this bottom of the barrel flick. The final curtain falls on this quite historic franchise but not to a standing ovation I'm afraid, bit of a stinker.",

Was it contractual obligation cause it can't have been the money, the budget on this is so shockingly low that it makes others in the franchise look epic in their budgets. The cast are so badly served by the script that Winslow barely utters a word in his own voice and the rest simply seem to wonder around in a daze. Lee is quite clearly slumming it, though during the 90's he wasn't exactly known for being picky and Perlman has never been one to turn down a job either. Schlatter is the new addition to the cast no doubt thrown in by producers to hopefully appeal to a younger audience, the following year he'd join Diagnosis Murder(!), and desperately trying to fill Guttenberg and McCoy's shoes as the cheeky chappy lead. Thank god the franchise ended their I don't think the world could have stood another dose of Police Academy.",

There are many low points - Connors' pursuit of pretty Russian translator Claire Forlani (why do they need a translator when everyone speaks English?), the aforementioned Three Stooges... but the waste of Cpt. Harris is probably the worst. G.W. Bailey is game as always but with no bumbling sidekick to play off of he seems lost, and it robs the film of what had up to this point been a reliable lifeline of good gags.

The first one is still okay and reasonably funny but still not great. The second it worse and the third one awful. The fourth one saved the series a little but then the fifth and six are shockingly bad, worse than ever before. Then we have the seventh one. Why the fuck are such highly acclaimed stars such as Christopher Lee, Ron Perlman and Claire Foralani appearing in this movie. This however does not save the movie. The production values are also better in this movie than any of it's predecessors but the content has just become better produced shit. Poor movie which bored the shit out of me. I hope they never make another one of these movies.",
