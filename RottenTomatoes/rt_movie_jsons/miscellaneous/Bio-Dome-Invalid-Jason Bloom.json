Needing a bathroom, the two friends enter what they think is a mall but soon realize is a high-profile, secure biological experiment. As they engage in a year-long battle with Dr. Faulkner (William Atherton) and the other scientists, Bud and Doyle are forced to confront the recklessness of their behavior.",

They are asleep and the two decide to sexually assault them. And let me remind you that this is played for laughs. So with that joke not only do you get the tone and what the target audience for this movie is, you can clearly see why this is one of the worst movies ever made.",

Stephen Baldwin is the brother everyone forgets. William Atherton was still dining out on Die Hard. It's all a big melting pot of facets that don't work, and they didn't in 1996.\n\nBut it does in 2018. It's a stupid film, it's a film only to be watched when you want to watch something stupid. Think of it like Wayne's World, it's a riot of stereotypical nineties grungey nonsense that you don't want to relate with but still somehow do.\n\nWe live in a world today where everything always seems so serious and everything always seems like it is beset by problems. We originally thought films like this were garbage simply because there were a lot more things that were funny in those days. It's not like that today so watch something like Bio-Dome, it's only 95 minutes of your life.

Shortly before watching Bio Dome, I had screened \"The Road to Bali,\" and Bio Dome is much better, Just like now, audiences loved the \"road\" movies and critics hated them. But they were fun to watch, and  according to Bob Hope, fun to make. Bio Dome is heads and shoulders better, and will be longer lasting, than the Hope and Crosby items, and for good reason. It has a well written script and many memorable characters. Don't dismiss this movie until you've seen it. Here's an interesting fact, there is not a single f word in this movie. There's so much to laugh at, and yet no one gets hurt. Even the fart jokes are gourmet fart jokes. No one sleeps with any one they shouldn't. Jack Black plays the guitar. I actually love the portrayal of the head scientist, who knows his Black Sabbath. The set up is fast and believable. It's a buddy picture, it's the nineties version of \"Road to Bali,\" and your grand children are going to want to watch it. Trust me on this one when I call it a classic. In a time capsule fun for all harm no one sense, it is classic. Lovely female leads, silly but handsome men, you're going to find in fifty years this one has virtues, and a plot. \"Oh my God it's the grassy knoll!\"  And, did I mention, a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Jack Black? He pretends to smash a guitar and then gently puts it down after singing a memorably terrible semi folk song. So funny.",

I know this is considered one of the worst movies ever made, and I wouldn't entirely disagree with that, since I did give it one and a half stars.  I don't mean to even come close to suggesting that this was a good movie, but I can sort of see how the film came to have a cult following.  Yes, the writing is childish, the characters of Bud and Doyle are stupid and obnoxious and the humor leaves a lot to be desired.  But you have to admit that there's a certain chemistry between Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin.  There were instances where they almost break character by laughing at what the other is doing.  It seemed like they legitimately enjoyed working with each other, so, to me, that actually did add something to the movie.  Clearly not much, but it added something.  At the very least it's not like a Sandler movie where they make offensive jokes about homosexuals, minorities, women, etc, etc before going \"I'm sowwy\" and slapping themselves on the wrists.  It's that sort of shit that people hate about Sandler.  At the very least this movie, to me, doesn't really seek to offend.  It's just a purposely stupid movie.  And it's really hard for me to hate a movie whose entire purpose is to be as dumb as humanly possible.  Then again, one of the worst film experiences I've ever had was Date Movie and that was designed to be really fucking stupid.  I think that, perhaps, if I watched the movie on my own then I wouldn't have hated it as much.  Since I watched this in a theater full of people, that all seemed to be enjoying the movie, it made the experience worse.  If I had been watching this in a movie theater full of people, I can imagine me thinking this is considerably worse than it actually is.  Again, I'd say that this movie is bad, but I can see how it has a cult following.  I can't say that for a lot of other movies with cult followings, like, for example, Grandma's Boy, which was just a dreadful fucking movie.  I think a lot of this film's reputation has to do with the fact that Pauly Shore himself has been, pretty much, a joke.  And I can see why.  He just looks like an unfunny asshole.  And I'm not saying that there aren't valid complaints about this film, but I'm certain that like .01% of that negative reaction is due to Pauly Shore being seen as a mockery of what 'real' comedy is like.  Pauly's comedic style isn't necessarily my cup of tea, I find him obnoxious, but I'm sure there's an audience for it.  Comedy is a more open-ended genre than any other out there.  What's funny to me might not necessarily be funny to anyone else.  Same with Pauly Shore.  But, like I said, him and Stephen Baldwin have surprisingly decent chemistry and that helps make the movie slightly more bearable.  Who am I kidding, this movie, realistically speaking, is kind of awful.  But it's an awful you can laugh at and get some enjoyment from.  I wouldn't recommend it, of course, but I had some good laughs at its expense.",

Unfortunately, the director made the ill choice of placing the camera on the inside of the dome. As opposed to the outside of the dome, where I presumed, since this is a film and as such is meant to entertain. It would have been very entertaining indeed to see Pauly Shore suffocate and die trapped within an airtight dome over the course of 1 hour and 28 minutes. But, that's not what we get. Instead, smarter minds than I teamed Pauly with Baldwin brother turned batsh*t crazy born again Christian Stephen Baldwin (the second most annoying person on the planet, eclipsed only by...Pauly Shore) for the tale of two morons (good casting) who get locked in a science experiment with environmental scientists for one year. One critic said this \"is a 50/50 movie, either you love it or you hate it.\" I'd describe it more as a 100/0 movie: you hate it. I read that Pauly Shore once said, \"Even at my peak, I never went too over the top.\" Well, if your peak only reaches the lowest depths of hell, it's kinda hard to even see a top over which you can go. So, to summarize: I'd rather watch Rosey Grier clip his toenails for an hour and a half than see \"Bio-Dome\" again.",

Back in the 1990's, there was a big push to make Pauly Shore a movie star whether audiences wanted him or not, and thankfully, most of his films were soundly rejected.\n\nShore's movies were mostly made for people who found Adam Sandler's brand of humor too high brow, and this one plays like something even Sandler would have passed on. It follows the same formula, and much of the alleged humor feels improvised, especially from the star and his sidekick, played by Stephen Baldwin. In many scenes, Shore seems to be having a hard time laughing, a sure sign that he's hearing much of this for the first time.\n\nAll I can say is that I'm glad someone was having fun with this dim, idiotic material. There's not one funny moment in the entire picture, and I imagine you would have to be very easy to please to find this anything more than just an insufferable mess. But, typical of movies of this nature, the two leads have impossibly hot girlfriends who for some reason find their inability to articulate sentences charming and they both become heroes in the end when they succeed in righting every wrong they've committed all in the name of \"comedy.\"\n\nIn that respect, \"Bio-Dome\" plays like a fantasy for morons everywhere. It seems to suggest that the slacker lifestyle will make all of your dreams a reality, or maybe I just had too much time to over-think this dud during all the downtime when I wasn't laughing.",

The plot clearly isn't much.\nLike I just said, there's barely any plot, rather just an excuse for a lame buddy comedy targeted for stoners. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I know I can't be the only one. Why is it so dumb? Why did people even think it was funny? Why did Stephen Baldwin EVER get into acting? It's like a dumber version of Bill and Ted, only it's more '90s than '80s. Believe me, it's 90s enough. The fashion, the constant grunge music, just the vibe feels like it's too 1990s. The whole film is annoying, has barely any plot, and is one of the dumbest comedies ever made.",
