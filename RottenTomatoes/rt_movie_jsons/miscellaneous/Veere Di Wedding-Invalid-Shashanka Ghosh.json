An absolute gem of a film with the right amount of quirkiness and depth. A really wonderful understanding on the real pressures women face as they find their balance between traditional and modern India. I appreciated the sense of humor. The performances were spot on and a special spot in my heart for seeing Vivek Mushran on screen again, in a very sweet role.",

            "content": "Veere Di Wedding looked so much fun. I thought we have finally got a female version Dil Chahta Hai with a Sex and the City rehash. But when I left the theatre, I was utterly exhausted. The girls do get the show well for most of the time I was into the film, but there is just too much of 'blabbering' rather than actually 'echoing' boldness. However, the film gets a thumbs up from my side because it celebrates warmth between these girls, and their sisterhood has been elevated in the film. It's a drag in the second half, but what stays with you is the light-and-breezy first half. ",

Sonam has shown a lot of her capabilities recently and Ms. Kapoor Khan never fails to amaze us. Swara Bhaskar from PRDP's sister to spoilt brat was an amazing transition. But the movie didn't have fixed storyline. The problems was not well defined. Screen time for each lady was biased. ZNMD couldn't be recreated. If more realistic problems were taken in considerations would've connected better.",

            "content": "The ratings and verdicts on this movie are likely based on the expectations viewers have before watching it. I went in with very high expectations of raunchiness, sex, testing deep waters, and \"Sex and the City\" quality screenplay and directing, because that's how the media has portrayed the film. It is even banned in Pakistan and some theaters in India.\n\nIf you want modern raunchiness, watch Delhi Belly. If you want sex, watch Kama Sutra and Fire. If you want to test the deep waters, watch Bandit Queen, Water and Earth.\n\nVeere Di tries hard to be something it is not. It only scratches the surface on too many themes to fit into one movie. The directing and screenplay are terrible and had unrealistic scenes and situations... like when Nirmal degrades Sonam Kapoor because she pecks him on his cheek... or when one of the men divorces his wife because he walks in on her pleasuring herself. There isn't even any making out or kissing, which Bollywood has become notorious for.\n\nThe movie would resonate more - for better or for worse - with people who are born and raised in India. People in the US would find it tacky and elementary.\n\nI am glad I saw it. I don't have any regrets. I was just disappointed because the media and other people have hyped this up unjustifiably.",
