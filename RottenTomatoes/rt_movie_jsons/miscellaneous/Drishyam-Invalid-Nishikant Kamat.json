            "content": "probably one of the best bollywood movies out there, even if it's a remake. I agree that this is a remake, and certainly (having seen both the pieces of work) this film in no way does a better job than the original Mohanlal film, but there are two sides to that aspect. there are good remakes and bad remakes. this film creates a newer branch for itself, great remakes! I can't express how much this film changed my perspective in viewing the thriller genre.\n\najay devgn portrays the protagonist (I don't know if we can really call him that) Vijay Salgaonkar (an orphan who has barely passed the 4th grade) so skillfully that I became a fan of him after this performance and it made me realise how much potential he carries as an actor (I literally started watching almost all his films after this). you instantly connect with Vijay and his family and even though Tabu and her gang of cops aren't necessarily the bad guys here, you view them from an antagonistic perspective, which makes you question your own morality. speaking of tabu, she needs to be kept in a gold vault and protected forever. tabu is essentially perfect casting, her performance as the inspector general of goa police investigating the missing and supposed death of her own son is so full of emotion, that you almost side with her but the film manages to keep you on the family's side only to completely blow you away in the climax (believe me, it's just bonkers).\n\nanother thing which I particularly love is the soundtrack and the music provided in this film. it's on point and placed perfectly throughout the film and provides more than enough depth required for a scene. what's surprising is, the soundtrack has been composed by the acclaimed director Vishal Bhardwaj who directed the Shakespeare trilogy of bollywood (which also I would highly recommend you to check them out). and after I see the score credits, I go and check his other credits and voila! he has composed scores for several other films too (including his own)! man, the guy is just so freaking talented. my favourite song from the film is Dum Ghutta Hai as it perfectly builds the required tension which the film pays off in the extremely beautiful second half.\n\nP.S.: some people would argue that giving this film 5 stars is a disservice to the original film which was made on a regional level while this being a worldwide release. I would just like to say that, just being a remake shouldn't be viewed as a point of hate for the film as it does a disservice to both, the original and the remade film because not everyone will watch the film in it's original language and not everyone will know how good regional cinema is. It ultimately falls upon personal preference how to watch a certain piece of cinema.",

            "content": "I am seven years late to this party, but what an amazing movie. It is quite feasible that in a terrible attempt to preserve one's dignity in a brutally judgemental and hypocritical society, an innocent victim can commit a crime, and their family can do their utmost to preserve and protect themselves. Vijay played brilliantly by the always capable Ajay Devgan, is the quintessential underdog, constantly underestimated by those who have absolute power in society, including the long oppressive, abusive arm of the law. The core thesis of the film is a gray area - the merits of self-defence and the controversial attempts to prevent one's family from being buried alive. This movie is at heart a battle between 4th grade graduate Ajay and ultra-powerful Inspector General Meera - what a brilliant game. Never underestimate the less educated, nor the power of learning from every possible source including movies and popular media. Like the title of the movie, the illusions you create will shape the narratives you endure.",

            "content": "Drishyam (??????) is a 2013 family drama-thriller Malayalam film written and directed by  Jeethu Jospeh starring Mohanlal and Meena in the lead roles. The film starts with a tag line that \"Visuals can be deceiving\" and it actually lives up to it. George Kutty (wonderfully essayed by Mohanlal) is an orphan and 4th class dropout who is running a local Cable TV network. He is a big movie buff who watches movies in a much focused manner and many of his decisions are influenced by the same. The movie portrays good family moments where George Kutty tries to be stingy (he has his own justifications for the same) and his wife Rani (Meena) occasionally demands of shopping, enjoying movie in a theater and food in a restaurant.\n\nGeorge Kutty, Rani and their two kids Anju (Ansiba Hassan) and Anu (Esther) together form a beautiful family picture until an unprecedented event hits them. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold from the end of the first half. The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop Sahadevan (Kalabhavan Shajon), stands its ground even as the law takes its course. The psychological cat-and-mouse game that ensues between George Kutty and the lady IPS officer Geetha Prabhakaran (Asha Sarath) has several moments that thriller buffs will dig into with delight. What is appreciable however is the adversary's acceptance of defeat, and the eventual respect that the two develop for each other. Prabhakaran (Siddique), husband of Geeta Prabhakaran also plays a vital role who seems to have non-biased approach. The movie doesn't try to justify what is right and wrong. It showcases the journey of a head of the family who protects his family by all means.\n\nSujith Vaasudev was successful in capturing the visual beauty of Rajakkad-Idukki. Music scored by Anil Johnson and Vinu Thomas was good. The editor's table was safe with Ayoob Khan. Overall, the movie Drishyam has been packaged well.",

            "content": "Synopsis - Georgekutty (Mohanlal) leads a family life comprising of Rani (Meena) & 2 kids, Anju (Ansiba) & Anu (Esther). Life changes with an incident entering to their lives uninvited.\n\nScript & Direction - I seriously believe Jeethu Joseph has done some kinda magic on himself. After a terrific \"Memories\", he came up with an astonishing piece of work in the same year in form \"Drishyam\". When I saw the censor certificate displaying 164 minutes, I thought pace will be an issue. But I cannot remember a movie in recent times which made me sit onto the edge of the seat for more than 2 hrs after a relaxing 40 odd minutes. There wasn't a single unnecessary scene and no complaints regarding the pace of the movie. Its will require a list to mention the positives of this movie. The theme of the movie is slightly familiar but the brilliant presentation followed but terrific execution by the actors and the technical side made this movie much superior to Memories. One place I was personally impressed was the movie provided moments for Mohanlal to rejuvenate himself. The character possessed a certain amount of freshness (Despite of being a common man) that enabled him to attain it. The actor in Lal was projected completely onscreen and its a treat to watch him handling the role using his trademark charisma. Mohanlal playing his age and Meena playing his wife was a masterstroke as far as casting is concerned and I cannot imagine any other young actress handling that role. Despite of being a thriller, the film doesn't carry those usual ingredients like twists n turn. Yet it thrilled me more than any branded thrillers in recent times. The movie also carried a good message regarding family values and estimating people. Jeethu smartly shown how cinema can influence an ordinary man. The unique experience which thrills you and yet play with your emotions at the same time is a novel experience. For eg --> The scene where Irshad makes an onscreen entry was one of the best scene I have seen in recent times. It conveys many meanings without any dialogues. Terrific Work..Jeethu Joseph!!! As far as the climax is concerned...I thought Jeethu might ran out of steam because of the extraordinary work he did till then...Well..It was Kick@$$ Stuff!!! The dialogues of this movie plays a huge role in concealing as well as revealing the motives of each character especially Georgekutty. After the experience, you will start to get the real meaning of many lines.\n\nCast & Performance - I am slightly inclined towards M S Dhoni as a cricketer these days!! After the experience, it was like watching an M S Dhoni Final Over ODI Thriller where he finishes off on a high note. Mohanlal did exactly the same!! It required not only a success but a good movie, good character to silence his critics n detractors. Well Lal had something better...replaced good with \"Outstanding\". Just cleared off all those mishaps of this year. His performance and Jeethu Joseph's presentation complimented each other you can see how actors use their experience in scenes where they tend to overact. Meena stole the show in the interval scene and the major highlight as far as casting is concerned. We know she is one of the many actresses who shares great chemistry with Mohanlal....That worked out well for the movie. The kids, Ansiba & Esther completed the image of the family with their terrific performances especially Esther. Kalabhavan Shajon delivered his best performance as the police officer. Siddhique, despite of a few scenes, left a mark. While the film's only negative happens to be the performance from Asha Sharath who seems to have not gelled with \"behaving\" in place of \"expressive\". Sukumar,Shobha Mohan,Kunjan,Irshad,Roshan Basheer,Narayanan,Kuttikal Jayachandran etc etc played the supporting roles quite well.\n\nSongs & Background Score - \"Maarivil..\" is a feel good number which depicts the happy hours of the Georgekutty's family while \"Nizhale..\" was played during a very important portiont of the movie. The background score was apt n was never loud by any means.\n\nTechnical Expertise - Sujith Vassudev's cinematography's work was commendable and slowly n steadily, he climbing up to the league. I loved the aerial shots during many important scenes which added to the impact. Ayoob Khan's editing was crisp and close to perfect. The climax and Irshad scene cuts were topnotch. Rest of the departments did a great job.\n\nBottomline --> What you guys are waiting for?..Grab the next tickets for the best movie of this season...or in recent times.",

            "content": "Drishyam (2013) Movie Review \n\n81 days since initial release, finally watched the much hyped Drishyam. To be fair and unbiased, Drishyam is an absolutely amazing movie, but still continues some of Director Jeethu Joseph's signature flaws. Don't get me wrong I'm a devout Lalettan follower and Jeethu fan, right from his first movie The Detective. The Best way to watch Drishyam is to set aside the star power of Mohanlal and the Directorial prowess of Jeethu, watch it from a pure human perspective and focus on the core story and it's underlying moral messages, principles and ideologies. The movie is a bit ragged around the edges like the inclusion of an obligatory long continuous shot, unwanted songs that break the movie's fantastic pacing, Jeethu's inherent amateur shots, especially the overdone, repetitive and violent interrogation scenes. One would doubt if it's a family movie at that point. Equally uninspiring is the cinematography, music and background score - technically unnoticeable and nothing special. Frankly, the film could have been 10 mins tighter with a far less drawn out opening act, that slowly sets up the tone for the brilliant and far superior second half. \nBut the highlight as always is Mohanlal as he steals the show and presents a common John Doe who is a grounded, mature and realistic character, reassuring us we can still expect more from him. Following up disasters like Ladies & Gentleman and Geethanjali, it's ironic how both the best and probably the worst (Geethanjali) movie of 2013 had Lalettan at it's helm, pointing to the fact that fresh ideas and Directors with better stories to tell are what the audience favors instead of dated veteran Directors and actors performing larger than life roles. It's a movie that could have been done by any actor but gets elevated to another level by the sheer acting skills of Mohanlal. Drishyam is both heart poundingly tense at it best moments and heart warmingly sweet and comedic in its better moments. Meena is devoutingly beautiful and stays true to her character. Kalabhavan Shajon presents a stellar performance as the antagonist. Other supporting cast including the children, Siddique and Asha Sharath is strictly okay, thanks to the swift editing. Drishyam presents a challenging story with a plausible deniability where justice varies in perspective as both sides of the same coin : the hero and the villain - one that explores a person's morally ambiguous ideologies. Kudos to Jeethu Joseph for his brilliantly written story with a satisfying end act which encompasses a neatly tied twist into it. It's hands down one of the best thrillers I've ever seen [far superior than Memories (2013)] deserving all the hype and ranks very high in my list of what to expect from Malayalam movies in future. \n\n+ves :\nBrilliantly written story. \nStellar performance by Mohanlal. \nPerformances of Meena and other supporting cast.\nThought provoking family themes and concepts of justice.\nHeart pounding drama and tense story telling. \nThrilling second half. \nBrilliant climax and \"secret\" twist. \n\n-ves :\nUnwanted long shot. \nUninspired songs, cinematography and music. \nViolent interrogation scenes. \n\"Amateurish\" shot selections by Jeethu.\nDrawn out first half. \n\nOverall Rating : 9.1/10.",

Writer ¬ùdirector Jeethu Joseph¬ùs Drishyam is one such film, a gripping tale that leaves you spellbound with its skillful craft.\n\nThe story begins as a simple and a rather conventionally presented family drama happening in a high range town, where a local Cable TV operator named George Kutty (Mohanlal) lives with his wife Rani (Meena) and daughters Anju (Ansiba) and Anu (Esther). Almost the entire first half shows how close knit they are as a family but an unprecedented happening mars their peaceful life. How they overcome such a difficult situation is the plot here.\n\nBased on an intricate screenplay that demands an amazing competence to make it convincing, Jeethu Joseph come out with an impressive finesse. The story has many layers that compel the viewer to enjoy this highly entertaining movie. Sujith Vaassudev¬ùs visuals are good and the music by Anil Johnson and Vinu Thomas add to the mood.\n\nFor the Mohanlal fans out there, especially those who were complaining about not seeing him in realistic and earthy roles, go for this one to see the hero in one of the finest performances in his highly illustrious career. You can watch him only in sheer disbelief as he gives subtle acting a new meaning, just like the way he has done in some of his brilliant roles in the past.\n\nThe rest of the cast have all done their roles really well but watch out for a sterling show from Kalabhavan Shajon, who is terrific as a corrupt cop. Drishyam is a sensational journey by a family as they go through a bitter crisis, which is perhaps more than what they can chew. It¬ùs a film with its heart at the right place and two big thumbs up for this honest attempt. Don¬ùt miss this one!",

            "content": "This movie is a remake of a Malayalam film also named Drishyam (2013), which was also remade in Kannada as Drishya (2014), Telugu as Drushyam (2014) & Tamil as Papanasam (2015). While you may be thinking of the reason behind its successful remakes, well its simple - a well crafted plot & an exceptional performances! As remakes were very well appreciated and received by the audience. So, now, it is the turn of a remake in Hindi. The film credits begin with the punch line: \"Visuals can be deceptive\". Indeed it turns out to be so. What we see could be absolutely deceiving. This film does not deal with the 'right / wrong'. It neither promotes the 'right' nor condemns the 'wrong'. No justification is given through the screenplay. The film depicts what one could do in a particular crisis. Especially, when it comes to one's family, he / she can turn out to be very protective and go to any extent to save his / her family. The film has to be watched not with the lens of wisdom, but with the lens of it being a piece of art, which showcases the journey of a head of a family who protects his family by all means. Visuals can be deceptive, don't always believe what you see because you can be easily manipulated, is what a film like Drishyam preaches. For me the only concern I took in while watching this film is that I had seen the Telugu version Drushyam (with subtitles) a couple of months back (Of course I dint know a Hindi remake was in production). Judging by the trailers, it seemed like a scene to scene remake, (which it actually is) & felt the film wouldn't do justice in comparison to the other version (which was awesome by the way), but nevertheless with such a strong story you cant go really wrong! For people who haven't seen the original this film could be a genre changing film, a suspense thriller that has not been seen on the Hindi screen celluloid. Its simply breathtaking! When the roots have already been built, it is about proper presentation in a particular amount of time which is where director Nishikant Kamat and his team come out triumphant. The best part about this movie is that it was presented and portrayed with utmost perfection in a manner in which the makers wanted it to be shown. The buildup was slow but every aspect was properly covered with enough evidence to win the audience. The story follows Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn), a 4th class fail cable service provider who lives with his wife Nandini (Shriya Saran) and two daughters Anju (Ishita Dutta) and Anu (Mrinal Jadhav). Vijay is also a great movie buff and he keenly watches various movies and also rationalizes the scenes. He emotes watching movies. Vijay's happy family picture gets a blow when an unprecedented event hits them. This event sees the entry of IG Meera Deshmukh (Tabu) and her husband Mahesh Deshmukh (Rajat Kapoor) in the scene. Situations take such a turn where Vijay finds himself opposite to Meera and in the shackles of law. What is that one event which makes Vijay and his family land in trouble? How they find themselves in the clutches of law? What is the thread which connects Meera and Mahesh to this event? How do the story move further, and the events unfold? Will Vijay and his family's lives be same ever again? Who is right: Vijay and his family or Meera & Mahesh? The climax is the high point of this movie, which is absolutely unpredictable. Watch it out yourself. Vijay's character development is myriad throughout the film and it compels you to think away from the extreme principles of black vs white, right vs wrong, yin vs yang.  His strong will and steadfastness to protect his family at all costs forms the backbone of the story. Even though the film is 2 hours and 43 minutes long, it binds the audience to their seats till the very last scene. The way the planning is done, the manner in which it is portrayed, the confidence with which the family handles tough interrogations, the way the sequences are shown is all just perfect. Hats off to the original writer Jeetu Joseph, he left no stone unturned. The adaptation by Upendra Sidhaye is really good with a few changes here and there. The story unfolds wholly in Goa. The writing & script was so good that for me, it easily comes up among st the best Bollywood has ever had. And the way Nishikant Kamat has handled it is simply phenomenal. The less said the better for Nishikant Kamat who has won my heart with such a wonderful vision and achieving the ultimate goal through this vision. You might feel that the pace is slow in the 1st half, but it doesn't bore you as its gripping. Some of the sequences are just scintillating especially after the arrival of Tabu. We have seen ample of movies regarding catching the criminal but this one is different, it's about saving the family. There are just 2 songs comprising of the evergreen duo of Vishal Bharadwaj and Gulzar Saab but music isn't what matters in this movie. It's the haunting & terrifying back ground music by Sameer Phaterpekar which makes you deeply involved. I would specially like to point out the background music during the interrogation involving Tabu with her deadly eyes & the haunting music. I was at a disadvantage because i had seen the Telegu version like I mentioned above that left me in awe, and this film is a 100% remake but just in a different language, and that is probably a good thing because the film didn't need any change. The first-hour is relatively slow-paced & although its never boring, the story doesn't really move. Its the second-hour that does wonders. I strongly feel if the first-hour was crisper & stronger, the overall impact would've enhanced even more. Coming to the performances, Ajay Devgn delivers a phenomenal performance, one that will be remembered. His eyes speak a lot & he lived the character of Vijay Salgaonkar. Tabu is simply outstanding as Meera, playing the role of a tough cop & a concerned mother. She chooses her roles wisely and delivers a great performance most of the times. Shriya Saran is too young to play a mother but she also performs wonderfully well. She had a couple of difficult scenes and she did it really well. Debutant Ishita Dutta makes a really good debut. Rajat Kapoor is at his fluent best as he usually is. Child artist Mrinal Jadhav also does a decent job. But its Kamlesh Sawant who impressed me a lot, he was simply sensational. Martin's cafe plays a crucial part in this movie and so does Martin uncle. Others were brilliant as well. Director Nishikant Kamat has done one hell of a job!! Even with such immense pressure to meet its successors, he has successfully crafted a brilliant thriller! On the whole, 'Drishyam', is an edge-of-the-seat thriller, does not tell you how to act during time of brutal crimes, but it finely creates a story so charming that you will be left in with your pounding heart, and a smile on your face at the end of the film. A genre changing film. A must watch if you haven't seen the original or any of the bilingual versions.",

            "content": "Visuals can be deceptive, don't always believe what you see because you can be easily manipulated, is what a film like Drishyam preaches. For me the one negative i took into watching this remake is that I saw the original Malayalam version with subs about a year and half back ago(this of course not knowing it will be made in hindi). So when compared to original even though its a scene by scene copy, it just doesn't have all the sheen of the original, but nevertheless with such a strong story like Drishyam you cant go really wrong. Because for the people who haven't seen the original this film could be a genre changing film, a suspense thriller that has not been seen on the hindi screen celluloid. Its simply breathtaking.\n\nThe films story is about a 4th grade drop out who is now married, has two girls, one who is in her late teens, the other is about 5-6 years old.The 4th grade drop out Vijay owns a local cable company, and all he does all day is watch movies. For him his family is everything. Then all of sudden tragedy strikes,while at a school camp a fellow student of his daughter makes a video of his daughter while taking a shower. The male who makes the video then tries to blackmail his daughter with the video for sex. In all this ruckus when the boy confronts  Vijay's daughter, he is accidentally killed by his daughter, and wife. What follows next is what forms the films crux. The rest is for you to find out.\n\nActing wise the film was throughly refreshing, seeing Ajay Devgn do a serious role, and not his usual boofnary seen in films like AJ and SOS. He played the common man role superbly. Shriya Saran looked beautiful and was first rate. Rajat Kapoor was good. But it is Tabu who steals the show, as a strict cop and a mother, she is fire on screen.\n\nDrishyam is a film in which you know who committed the murder, but the suspense lies in how the murder is covered up so smartly by a so called 4th grade drop out. The master plan will leave you speechless.\n\nOverall i was at a disadvantage because i had seen the original Drishyam that left me in awe, and this film is a 100% copy but just in a different language, and that is probably a good thing because the film didn't need any change. A enjoyable watch for me, but for a 1st time watcher you will be left in with your pounding heart, and a smile on your face at the end of the film. A genre changing film. A must watch if you haven't seen the original. \n\nFinally I just have one question, who far can you go to protect your family...\n\n3.5/5* or 7/10",
