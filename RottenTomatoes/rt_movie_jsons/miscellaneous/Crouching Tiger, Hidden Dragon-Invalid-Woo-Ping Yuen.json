The movie is a derivative cash-in and a far cry from its high-flying predecessor. There's a great teahouse fight where we meet Silent Wolf's warriors. That's all there is to see here.

We follow Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) as she is traveling to Peking where the sword of her love Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat who isn't in this movie) resides. She's attacked during this time, but saved by a mysterious warrior. Meanwhile the evil ruler Hades Dai (Jason Scott Lee) is seeking the sword (named the Green Destiny) because a blind sorceress (Eugenia Yuan) has fortold that his destiny lies with the Green Destiny and that if he doesn't have it he will never truly rule. Hades sends a young man named Wei Fang (Harry Shum Jr) to retrieve the sword, but during his attack he is stopped by a young lady named Snow Vase (Natasha Liu Bordizzo). Snow Vase has traveled to Peking to seek out Yu Shu Lien in order to learn her fighting skills from her. Also meanwhile (can you tell this movie is all over the god damn place?) The mysterious warrior that saved Yu Shu Lien reveals himself to be Silent Wolf (Donnie Yen). Silent Wolf hears about Hades plan to get the Green Destiny, so Silent Wolf ends up getting a band of warriors together to attack him first. I'm gonna stop right here because going back and reading this the plots all over the place. Don't get me wrong it could have worked, but they just don't spend enough time on any one character. We get too many subplots going on. Wei Fang and Snow Vase have a connection, but when you figure it out it's kinda like...that's it? Then Yu Shu Lien and Silent Wolf have a connection, but it's never believable enough for me because it's just a lot of mentions. Then finally as much as it was cool to see Jason Scott Lee in something he's just a typical bad dude that we never learn much about either. This film is a travesty in quality compared to the original. It's very apparent they are shooting on sets for a majority of the scenes. There's even a lot of CG at times and it looks terrible. It looks like a straight to DVD movie and it pretty much is. The movie was also shot in English which blows my mind since the previous film was traditional Mandarin. I will say I did enjoy Donnie Yen in this movie. I liked the fight sequences most of the time it's still very fun to see the over the top action. Unfortunately, this movie is just one of those films that you only watch for the fight scenes and ignore everything else that is happening. As a fan of the first one I would say this is a skip, but if you really have to check it out on Netflix as it's exclusively streaming on there.",

            "content": "Being a huge fan of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', I ignored the negative reviews for this quasi sequel. The first act made me think I'd made a mistake. It's a bit slow and not much happens, but it's other factors that took me by surprise. An immediate slap in the face is the decision to have the actors speak English, presumably to attract a wider audience, but only serves to remind you that you're watching a Western-produced film (that's supposed to be set in 18th-19th century China) and takes you right out of the experience. That mistake is followed by the next: the tone, which, to put it bluntly, is hella corny and sprinkled with extra cheese here and there. I also noted the production design which gives off a somewhat unauthentic vibe, making it feel like an expensive made-for-TV production (which, technically, I suppose it sort of is). Now, you can't really blame or compare Yuen Woo-ping, who's known for a less serious style, to Ang Lee, but it does make you wonder why they chose him to direct. Fortunately, he's known for another thing, too: choreographing fight sequences, and there's enough fantastic ones to enjoy here. \n\nIn short, I think they tried to do their own thing, making something that is reminiscent of the original masterpiece, but not a complete copy. That could have been a clever move, but unfortunately, it doesn't work. It's acceptable as a made-for-TV film with its corny tone and Western vibe, but it really doesn't come remotely close to holding a candle to the original. \n\nThere are a few flashes of greatness that make you perk up, including some really nice, sweeping shots; captivating performances from both Yen and Yeoh; and the aforementioned fight sequences, but to be honest, I could have absolutely skipped this and felt like I didn't miss out on much.",

I certainly had not watched its predecessor which, as I discovered afterwards, seems to have received quite high ratings.\n\nTo me this was a fairly decent movie quite adequate for a little Monday evening TV session. I would probably have been a wee bit disappointed if I had spent money and effort to see it in a movie theater though.\n\nI did like the overall story and the cinematography. It did feel quite a bit like a old western in Asian setting. Make the sword a shipment of gold, the setting in the old west, add the hero and the gang of good guys with pistols instead of swords, do not forget the bad guy with his cronies and you have a good old fashioned Western. That is not really bad thing as far as I am concerned. The Asian setting and the Asian honor culture adds a lot of elegance to the movie.\n\nThe story is plain and simple with few surprises. As tradition dictates there is plenty of Asian martial arts going on. The fights are a little on the slow side and clearly intended for a rather low content rating. You never see anyone get really hurt. Sure people die but the deaths are quite bloodless. Personally I would have preferred a bit more hard hitting action. The fights almost became a bit comical at times.\n\nI would say that the characters are okay. Not the best actors I have seen but I found them to be adequate. I did like the good guys. The bad guy could have done with a bit more charisma and the witch or whatever she was supposed to be felt underwhelming and underdeveloped.\n\nOne thing that annoyed me was this unrealistic flying around by some of the characters. Sure, it looked somewhat cool and very elegant but come on! Suddenly it appeared like the character became weightless and just floated through the air. Not very convincing.\n\nOn the whole I did enjoy the movie but, as I indicated above, it was not really a wow kind of movie. I have actually added the predecessor to my shopping list since that one got so good reviews. Speaking of reviews, on all the review sites I have looked this movie gets a rating of about 6 out of 10. Of course one site just had to stand out. Rotten Tomates! Their so called \"critics\" gave it a rotten rating with an abysmal score of 19%. What the f...?

It continues of the sword and fantasy during the Qing dynasty being central to Michelle Yeoh's Yu Shu Lien and this time, Donnie Yen playing the complicated romantic interest. He's not replacing Yun-Fat Chow's Li Mu Bai, of course not, but is simply another character thrown into the fray. \n\nThe actually phrase \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" was first coined by the Chinese poet, Yu Xin, and is sometimes use to refer to the real life military strategist and philosopher, Zhuge Liang or sometimes known as  Kongming, the same guy who invented the fashionable lanterns that people release into the sky. Being symbolic of a true master in hiding, possibly waiting. Almost like Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars. But I'm not entirely sure who it's referring to in the film. \n\nThe legendary Woo Ping Yuen, director of many Kung fu classics such as The Drunken Master and fight choreographer for The Matrix returns to direct this sequel. I say return as he was, of course, the fight choreographer for Ang Lee's previous film, \n\nThe fighting is exceptionally creative, fantastic and plentiful but that shouldn't be too surprising with Woo Ping at the helm. The wire work is unfortunately too obvious, some of the fighting being comical but pays homage to the classic Kung Fu's of old and on the whole, beautifully executed and captured. \n\nMichelle Yeoh returns and as always, does impressively well considering she is not trained in the martial arts. Hong Kong superstar Donnie Yen does what he does best and is in no means a disappointment to watch him in action playing Silent Wolf. (Makes you think of Chuck Norris yes?) But it was great to see Jason Scott Lee, though much older than Disney's Mowgli and the Bruce Lee he played in Dragon. \n\nShigeru Umebayashi does a grand score, respecting traditional music of the orient and creating a strong sense of mysticism and fantasy. \n\nSomething to be noted about this film is the spoken language. Being filmed in English because surprisingly, Ang Lee's film insulted much of the mandarin speaking world, convincing the studios to choose an English dialogue so not to repeat the same mistake. Only three of the four key characters in Ang Lee's film actually spoke fluent mandarin. \n\nWhilst it's a good film, it has loss the majestic gracefulness the first film had, a certain elegance and finesse, but as a stand alone martial art picture, it's good enough and very enjoyable. \n\nRunning Time: 7\nThe Cast: 8\nPerformance: 7\nDirection: 7\nStory: 6\nScript: 6\nCreativity: 8\nSoundtrack: 7\nJob Description: 5\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 0\n\n61% 6/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

But it was difficult and expensive to run, so most of the time\nthey would show whatever Hollywood blockbuster they could get their\nhands on in order to attract moviegoers, and hopefully the management could\nturn a profit and pay the rent on the building. I got to know a few of\nthe people that worked there, and we would discuss whatever movie was\nplaying at the time. I was influenced by the staff there to seek out\nforeign films, and not limit myself in terms of what simplistic\ncinematic experiences were coming out of the U.S at the time. As we all\nbecame friends, the manager got a hold of a reel of 'Crouching Tiger,\nHidden Dragon' and screened it for a 2 weeks in my small, winter town\nup in the mountains of Canada.\n\nIt was the most defining and beautiful foreign film I had ever seen up\nto that point. The depth of story, the well defined and bold\ncharacters, the incredible beauty and choreography of every jump,\nthrow, and kick. It was an incredible love story, but so much more than\nthat, it was something that really stayed with me long after the film\nwas over. I had just enjoyed my first love story, and it was a movie\nthat made me sad and pleased at the same time. I watched it several\ntimes for those two weeks, and I would always find something new in the\nfilm (whether it was put there intentionally or if it just my imagination was irrelevant). It was, and still is, the seminal film in which I compare all martial arts\nmovies to. It moved me. It made me cry. It helped me to comprehend a\nculture I didn't understand, in a language that I had never heard before.\nYet most importantly it was complex and curious and a wonderfully\nmoving story.\n\n... I can barely express my disappointment with its sequel...\n\nNetflix gets their money hungry claws into this\none, and it shows in every single frame and scene. Everything about this movie is an insult to the original. From the simple and barely driven story, to the weak and\nunforgivably trite plot devices (most of which are just copied from the\noriginal), and the characters that are so paper thin; you can see right\nthrough their terrible visage and are forced to bear witness to actors trying their hardest to not appear to be actors. \n\nThis movie is a complete and utter sham. A cash grab for a company that could\nafford the property rights in hopes to make a quick payday. The\nlanguage is lost as we are forced to listen to the actors speak their\nnon-native English, which ruins the poetry of the dialogue that was in the original masterpiece. The actors all seem to mistake acting for memorization, and watching them is remarkably like actors on some daytime T.V soap\nopera (or if you can recall the show Mortal Kombat: Conquest? It feels\na bit like that, but much... much worse). To be honest, I was surprised\nMichelle Yeoh would even agree to do this movie, despite the 16 years\nsince the first film. There has been ample time for a well written\nsequel, but unfortunately, this is not it.\n\nThis is such an offense the original film, that it should never have been made. Disgraceful.\n\n1/5",

A provincial warlord (Jason Scott Lee) is looking to steal the weapon in a bid for power, but Shu-Lien also has to contend with a passionate warrior woman (Natasha Liu Bordizzo), a troubled man with divided loyalties (Harry Shum Jr.), and a former lover who was believed dead (Donnie Yen). Ang Lee has long since moved on to other projects, so fight choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping has replaced him in the director's chair; most of the fights peppered throughout the predictable story do not rise above his prior efforts, but he does stage an engaging sequence on a frozen lake. While this sequel does have a few worthy moments, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword Of Destiny feels cheaper, blander, and far less artful than its predecessor.

The fight choreography, the music, and the cinematography.  The sequel has a few of these elements, mainly the cinematography.\n\nThe thing that struck me first was the fact that the movie is in English.  It just seems wrong to see both Donnie Yen and Michelle Yeoh speaking English in a movie when the original was in Chinese.\n\nSecond, the fight choreography.  When you have people such as Michelle and Donnie Yen you expect a level of sophistication.  Instead we are treated to slow action and the overuse of the transition slow-motion shots.  Gone are the fight choreographers that did such spectacles like IP Man, The Matrix, and numerous Jackie Chan films.  The movie has a feeling of quantity of quality during the fight scenes.  Think back to IP Man, the three main fights.  Ip versus the foreigner, Ip versus 10 japanese men, and Ip versus the General.  With the exception of the 10 versus Ip they concentrate on just two combatants.  Just like in the original Crouching Tiger.  It allows us to get a feel for the style each character has, not just some quirk that you will see in a large battle.\n\nWoo-Ping Yuen, the director did a good job.  But having seen the previous film he directed, True Legend, it left me wanting for so much more.  To this day I have only watched True Legend once but when I want to watch something cool I will return to it to watch the amazing fight scenes.  I can only hope he will return to making films like that, even if they don't have the marketability that Netflix provided.\n\nThe movie also falls victim to the Star Trek (2009) villain problem.  The villain shows up and then disappears for most of the movie.  He doesn't feel like a threat.  Instead he just sends out people to do his bidding.  In addition, it tries to follow too many plot lines.  Something that many felt happened with the 2000 film too (read: the desert love plot line).\n\nSo, like many others have said before me; not a great film.  But, I applaud Netflix for trying to do what they did and it is unfortunate that they were met with such opposition when trying to release the film in theaters.",

Ang Lee broke into the ranks as a serious threat of movie making with it thanks to his seamless blend of drama, heart, and action.  Which is why it's unfortunate a semi-respected martial-arts director like Woo-ping Yuen failed in nearly every one of those categories in the second go-around nobody really asked for or saw as necessary.\n\nThough Michelle Yeoh returns to add authenticity to this being a direct sequel, most all the other actors are plucked from obscurity or asked to mail in a performance, like Donnie Yen or Jason Scott Lee, to put some heft into an otherwise bland cast.  What disrupts the integrity of the movie more-so than the clunky storytelling is the fact it was all done in English with Chinese dub.  \n\nThe story is as much of a rehash as last time without the pomp or frill of an excellent drama.  With Sword of Destiny, the dialogue is cheesy, the rhythm of the film is staccato, and believing in these characters because less enthralling the further along the movie progresses.\n\nBut the beauty is still there.  Sweeping screenshots of the beautiful landscapes with crisp sound effects and spectacular weapon design at least give you the small resemblance of being back in this world from so long ago.  The martial arts seem pretty standard when compared to the first movie (some might even say lesser than the first), but I was still glued to the TV during the ice-lake fight.\n\nWhen it really comes down to it, the appeal to make a sequel outweighed the sense to do it.  We are left with a pretty hollow story line that fails to make its point ring true.  A prequel with all new actors (or even the same) or an entirely different take on this \"Iron Way\" would have at least allowed the filmmakers to stand apart from the first instead of cowering under its immense shadow.",

Whereas its predecessor excels in quintessential Chinese cinematography, compelling story telling, emotionally invested characters, epic fights, enticing romance, and an in-depth tragedy, Sword of Destiny feels like a cheap Hollywood imitation with all the spectacles, but none of the substance and aesthetics of the old film. While it retains at least one character from the older film, remains faithful to the wire-flying techniques, and repeats the theme of the master-apprentice relation, it completely fails to capture what made its predecessor great. Even if one generously decides to evaluate the film on its own merits independent of the original \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" it comes across as another generic and cheap martial arts movie. Most of the characters in Sword of Destiny are barely developed, so when some of them die in battle one barely feels any sympathy. The romance in the film is unconvincing because the background story behind Silent Wolf (Donnie Yen) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) is unbelievably comical (you have to watch it for yourself to see why it's bad). The villain is quite possibly the most shallow character in the movie as one has yet to figure out his motives beyond \"I want to rule the world with a kick-ass sword!\" Jade Fox from the original was far more developed and interesting. To make matters worse, the basic plot structure is virtually identical to the original movie: save the Green Destiny from a power hungry villain. A lot of the non-antagonist characters (except Shu Lien and Silent Wolf) are underwhelming and undeveloped. Snow Vase and Wei Fan are among the more developed characters in the film, but their existence feels so contrived as it becomes apparent that all this time they exist primarily for romance and revenge. The ending feels cheap as there's no real sense of tragedy and there's a happy ending for everyone (that is, everyone who is important in the film). Overall, this is a cliche and generic martial arts film that may entertain you, but fails to be just as good or better than the original.",

This movie looks like a made for TV kung fu movie compared to the original. First off, it is in English, which takes away from the authenticity that the first film had. The script and dialogue is laughable. Michelle Yeoh and Donnie Yen are the only bright spots in this. Jason Scott Lee looks like he is playing a video game villain. What does save the film is the amazing fight scenes. As long as everyone is kicking ass, the film is fun to watch. Other than that, this is a sequel that probably could have stayed in the book. \n\nGrade: B-",

And the young female lead was really pretty and took her role seriously (even if I found it hard to take her seriously with her Australian accent) and I look forward to seeing her in other roles.\n\nMore complaints:  It felt like bits were being taken from generic fantasy tropes (annoyingly, Western generic fantasy tropes) like the creepy priestess in Game of Thrones, and a motley crew of good guy sidekicks who excel more in witty banter than actual fighting.  There's also a forgettable main villain and forgettable people who want vengeance against him.

To be fair, the lack of Ang Lee's visual vision is truly apparent and the movie operates on smaller production as well, however that doesn't take away from its identifiable stylish choreography. This is a solid action martial art movie that is burdened by the legacy and expectation of its name.\n\nStory resonates with the first movie in more ways than one. It has a couple of estranged romance plots in the backdrop of martial art world, which feels like an attempt to replicate the already proven formula. It's admittedly difficult not to be haunted by the ghost of the original, specifically since it doesn't have the same caliber of chemistry, for example the mentor-student relationship is clearly inferior to those of Chow Yun Fat and Zhang Ziyi had.\n\nStill, \"Sword of Destiny\" has a couple of surprises. It works better when it's trying to develop something of its own, although it's a difficult endeavor since the movie utilizes so many nostalgia angles. The subplot with younger couple is decent, it's one of the flashbacks which doesn't feel encumbering. \n\nThe antagonist side is actually interesting, with more sinister villain and henchmen. The female assassin is intriguingly strong, perhaps more than the ragtag army from opposite side. It also has strange witch character who gives prophecy. In a way the movie has archaic oriental touch like that of Dragon Tiger Gate. Unfortunately, they are not given more spotlight beyond typical bad guys. \n\nWithout Ang Lee, the visual is certainly different. The original had such gripping vistas, even more enchanted by the characters leaping through the air. That sense of liberation is now more constrained in plain or dark spaces. However, \"Sword of Destiny\" will not disappoint in the fighting department, in fact this is a more than decent showing for Wu Xia.\n\nThe action choreography is appropriately done. There's a benefit in having Woo Yuen Ping as director as he knows how to implement the scenes with fluidity. Fight scenes are gripping and intense, using the mix of blinding fast as well as technique strikes. It's one of the better displays of martial art genre, even compared to higher budget titles.\n\n\"Sword of Destiny\" deals with the same predicament as the characters, it's haunted by the legend of Li Mu Bai, which is an inherited risk of donning the name \"Crunching Tiger Hidden Dragon\". It's quite unfortunate since it might distract audience from what is a good stylish action movie on its own.\n\nPS: It seems Netflix version is in English, but the one shown in IMAX has Chinese dub with English subtitle.",

Compared to his (Yuen Wo Ping) previous work, 'Sword Of Destiny' was kinda meh, the action was neither majestic or kickass, in fact, it looked half-assed.

Fighting was slow-paced; no eye-popping acrobatics; wire-fu was clunky; non-Martial Artists were painfully noticable.\n\nThe worst thing about 'Sword Of Destiny' though... English.

The movie was set in the heart of ancient mythological China, but everyone spoke nearly perfect English. So weird and really took away from the movie.\n\nCringey humour; useless witch lady character that served no real purpose; quick turn-of-heart for the main guy; we've seen her before: bad-turned-good girl character; didn't care for the supporting good guy characters even when they died; one-note main bad guy; kinda boring overall.\n\nI knew it wasn't gonna compare to the first movie, but man, I didn't think it'd be that disappointing.",

When I heard that they were doing this movie I wanted this movie to be OFF THE CHAIN. When I found out it was going to be featured on Netflix I then became skeptical. The movie lost MAJOR points with me because they really took a lot of authenticity away from this project by making it in English and dubbing it Chinese. WHAT? Why would you do that?

The Martial arts in it was pretty good at times but you can tell in some scenes that the actors were being favored by the camera with student doubles or just slow movements in the fight scenes. The acting was solid and believable but just not as authentic as it should have been with the Chinese dialect. A bit embarrassing if you ask me. How do you make a period Chinese film in English when English wasn't even introduced to that land back then? I was surprised to see Harry Shum jr. in this but he didn't do bad at all for the role he played. Donnie Yen did his thing and Michelle Yeoh also showed that she still has it. When I saw that Jason Scott Lee was the bad guy I knew that the martial arts scenes he was going to be involved in would be short changed of the real martial arts talent that this movie required. As I suspected and as I saw in the trailer, they had way more CGI in this than they should have. It really covered up the lack of skill and authenticity by trying to add cool effects. Â Wire work is expected of course but they pushed it too far with this. It was just done just because and without the beauty the predecessor had. The scenery wasn't even that great either. The pacing although was not bad it could have given you more time to enjoy more of their world and their way but like I said the feeling was already thrown off with the lack of their native dialect. The title song from the first movie was brought back but the rest of the music was less than memorable. I'm really disappointed that this was down this way. So much beauty was absent as what made the first film a desirable spectacle and classic.\n\n\nSo what I'm sayin is...\n\n2 1/2 out of 5 STARS",

            "content": "I've always wondered for a long time, if we ever going to have sequel. 16 years later, we finally have one and it's wonderfully done. This time, Yuen Woo-Ping directed this movie. Without a doubt, I know it's going to be a good movie because I really like his work. If you're not familiar with him, he's done fight choreography for the first movie, Drunken Master, Iron Monkey, Fist of Legend, Fearless, and of course The Matrix trilogy, just to name a few. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny has a beautiful cinematography and the fight scenes undoubtedly done so well. I'm just so glad there are no shaky camera scenes at all. Just the way it supposed to be. The plot is to be expected that it's a continuation from the first movie and set itself like it was the beginning of a new martial world era. It did just that and with the arsenal of new characters being portrayed by awesome actors such as Donnie Yen and Jason Scott Lee, the movie is just awesome. Michelle Yeoh reminds us how poetic a movie can be, especially that this is a sequel to first Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon movie. The poetic feel overall carried into the Sword of Destiny and it never left its originality from the first. With an addition of some CGI, it's really not that bad and at least it didn't incorporated in the fight scenes that much. All fights are legit and while it's not something others expect to be better than the first, I think it's equally well done. The story brings another vengeance, lost love, and intense martial art fights. Just like the first and you'll have that feel of it when you watch the sequel. If not, then that's too bad. I thought it was pretty damn good. Especially the fight scene on the vast floor of ice. That really sold me in terms of fight scenes in this movie. The climax was quite epic and the ending was superficial enough. If you're like me, who is a sucker for kung fu films, then don't fret. It's another epic periodic martial arts film. One movie I would like to add in my list of favorite kung fu films.",

Not as fantastical or drama ridden as the first possily due to different budgets and director but still intense enough and action filled to keep you interested. The choreography of the sword fights are as usual immaculately staged and dynamically captured thanks to Yuen Wo Ping and his team. Donnie Yen looks tired and withdrawn possibly because the part demands it and Michele Yeoh sports constant red eyes throughout the film as if tears would spurt out any second! It's nowhere near as sad as the previous film nor is it as beautifully shot in a multitude of magnificent locations and spectacular sets but it still manages to keep me thrilled for the entire time, especially this being in Cantonese, although the dubbing leaves much to be desired, I can enjoy the image a whole lot more not having to read the subtitles! One complaint I have is the post processing of the print which gives it an overly blue tint which makes everything looking insipid or is that intentional?! One last thing, this being the first Netflix Original Film, it will be available on Netflix on Feb. 26 in your home, thus it's hard pressed to find a cinema showing it in HK or any other country where Netflix is available on a subscription basis.",

CTHD is one of my all-time favorite movies, so without the forced connections to CTHD, this is a 3-star rating; however, my biggest problem with this movie is that it unravels some of the most powerful elements of that movie, turning the Green Destiny from just a really great sword into the Holy Grail, and painfully wastes an amazing returning actor Michelle Yeoh and the great Donnie Yen.

Also the fact it seems to scream a bit that they grabbed a Donnie Yen picture and inserted Michelle Yeou's character and her sword into the proceedings for a chance to cash in on the legacy of the first films success, and also chance enough to make it even more \"accessible\", right down to a potential cardinal sin of making a foreign film which only added to the mystique English speaking  which kind of throws a little of the continuity out of whack.
