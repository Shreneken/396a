            "content": "A good movie to consider watching if you like clever dialogues. Most of the film is based in one apartament without any scene changes whatsoever, and although it starts a little funny and silly, the more the movie progresses, the more serious it becomes, which is why I liked it. It shows that not a single person existing is able to speak of himself as of who he actually is, how we love to \"guard\" ourselves behind these perfect life scenarios, which we imagine in our heads. It shows that in some cases, there are things that could expose the truth and truth will always be exposed. But most important question is \"Will somebody forgive your truth, even if it's very disturbing? Can love manage to get a person through that?\". As I have already stated, the movie is based on dialogues. Obviously they are not like any of Tarantino's, but they are worth a mention, as they keep the viewer entertained and interested in what could possibly happen next in this, at first look, obvious happily ending movie. What the director basically does is he just takes all your expectations and throws them into the garbage can, as he nails the transition from a regular comedy to a serious drama perfectly. All the actors are playing amazingly, the setting is believable, and, most importantly, it's modern and realistic. Such scenario could happen to anyone and could lead anyone into deep thoughts about what they are doing wrong about their lives, especially those people who are having affairs and are lying about their love. Every single lie and every single choice counts, as it could destroy someone's entire life. A great movie to consider watching, strong 8/10 because of how interesting it was to watch and how well acted it is, although it is not a must watch masterpiece.",

However, the cracks of the relationship between the three couples, and among the bunch of friends, are already there. Mobile phones are more likely to act as the analyst that accelerate the rate of breaking the relationship, which project the situation of most of the relationship at the edge in reality. After this intense movie, I discussed with my boyfriend regarding two questions (1) before they started the game, which couple he thought had the most serious issue of their relationship; and (2) after the game, which couple? We came to a consensus that regarding question one, the couple of Lele and Carlotta, while in terms of question two, the Rocco and Eva. Can you guess why?",

            "content": "This looks at first like a Bergman-style analysis of relationships, the characters forced claustrophobically together until the truth is out. But it belongs in a stream of Italian films that seem to apologise for questioning traditional concepts of marriage, gender, sexuality and family. Despite an efficient script and quality acting, it is forced, and has its eye to an invisible censor. It is saying 'Oh, I am so shocked', but no modern, first world viewer can be greatly surprised at what happens. The male characters consist of three heroes, their faults forgivable, plus an attractive anti-hero. You could see in these men a religious theme of the holy trinity plus the devil. But it never cuts unflinchingly deep as Bergman would have done; for example, is it really saying that God or Christ could be gay? The women are fallen, made ridiculous, or heart-broken; they end up diminished, and not powerful at all: compare Autumn Sonata, Scenes from a Marriage, or Persona; or the biblical stories of women.  The screenplay dodges direct accusation by giving equal time and space to all of the characters, and placing them more or less symmetrically. It is an intellectual exercise, good to look at, with clever twists, like a competent, allegorical painting. There is little involvement for the audience; without an emotional d\u00e9nouement the ending was a problem, and it resorts to a glib device. Along the way, cut-and-paste pictures of an impossibly huge moon are a hilarious pointer to the film's problems with sincerity - watch for the unmoving clouds. Perhaps this show is telling us where modern Italy is at; or where someone thinks it should be, laced with generous doses of guilt. Maybe it holds up a documentary mirror to bourgeois society more generally. Maybe it is saying to mind your morals in the age of social media. If you are not too bothered about intellectual honesty, or about being fed a subliminal religious or moral lesson nodding to conservative authority, then you can sit back through this like a good soap, and chuckle and tisk your way along at the self-inflicted tribulations of a group of well-off people, all of it presented in a lush interior, or classically handsome streets, and delivered with the inimitable Italian talent for style.",

            "content": "Is your cell phone safe to make a transparency?\n\nUsually the films based on the dinner party associate with either family or the friends reunion and sometimes business related affair. But there's always a reason for such gathering like it might be a wedding, funeral, anniversary, a school reunion, getting a job or promotion, victory celebration et cetera. In this film, it was some long time friends meet which seems its their regular thing to do often. This tale covers one such fine evening to reveal what they actually do. A limited cast and one night event based film that cleverly and cautiously covers sensitive topics of the married life and trust of the friendship.\n\nIt has been almost a year since my last Italian film and now I'm happy for choosing this. I was not certain that I would like it till I saw it. So I would say same to you that see it first and then judge the product. This is really a good comedy-drama with a dark tone. We all adapted the modern way of life and gadgets makes so easy to accomplish things around us. In that, cell phones might come the first. Carrying it all the time became only next to wearing clothes, surely an artificial/digital sense of man. It also has some flaws, like it may land you in troubles as it's a part of AI, not human. I think it is easy to forecast a man's future by checking out his phone rather than his horoscope.\n\nSeven friends, including three married couples and one single man gather for a dinner party. They have been doing it for a very long time and that's where they all can share each others current life affair. Having some laughs and serious discussions, it defines the strength of their relationship. Every occasions won't be the same, there's always a first time for everything. That's how the event comes crashing out.\n\nWhile the party was going smooth, unexpectedly a game emerges that they all must place their phones on the table to prove they have no secrets from each other. Incoming and outgoing calls, texts, emails, everything must be heard by everyone at the table. What do you think would happen? Before saying anything, just place yourself in that position and do you think you can get away with a clean slate? Obviously tough to answer that, only practical observation would bring the result.\n\n\"He's seeing a therapist, not a whore! Come on!\"\n\nEverytime when there's an alert for an incoming call or message, the atmosphere gets more tense and as a viewer I went blinkless. It is not about what people hid from others, it is the reaction in the room when their secret was exposed. This is when adults become teenagers who try to explain the stuff when their parents find out their secrets. And so the friends become complete strangers. Because friends must back each other in the bad times, but in this scenario, it was totally out of the proportion regarding their action. Okay, if we push away the friendship, then how's the married one should take it. Feels very simple, since everyone involved in something, it has turned out to be a complicated affair.\n\nLike I said I've seen plenty of similar themed films, but this one was something unique in a simple way. There's a vast difference between what do you witness in the opening compared to how it concludes. A bad mouth can spoil a beautiful occasion, but now it is avoided since people learnt to shut their mouth. Just remember the film 'August: Osage County' and this film was no way close to it as a story, but developed to the next gen, the digital troubles the mankind had set to face. This film revealed how much a cell phone would cause trouble, then think what would happen with the robots of the tomorrow. Surely in 20-30 years from now, a similar film will be made with the bots.\n\nAt some point, I thought it might be the Italian version of the 'Coherence' for inclusion of lunar eclipse in the plot. I'm not going to say anything about that, you'll get it in your watch. There's no end twist, but it was an unexpected final scene. By then you will understand the meaning of the title. Awesome screenplay and well performed actors, this is one of the best films of the year so far. This is not a sci-fi or a thriller or a visual spectacular, but a smart little drama and I'm sensing that somebody might consider it for a remake. I know everyone won't like as much I did, but I won't end my review without recommending it. If you like talk movies, sure you does enjoy it.\n\n8.5/10",
