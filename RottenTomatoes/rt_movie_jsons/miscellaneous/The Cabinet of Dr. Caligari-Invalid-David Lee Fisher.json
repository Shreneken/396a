It has influenced to a degree every horror film, every serial killer film, and a great many films in other genres that have been made since. Among its most striking elements were the surreal, expressionist sets in which the action took place. This version uses modern digital technology to superimpose a new cast of actors on the actual images of the original sets. This gives us a Cabinet of Dr. Caligari with sound but with exactly the same scenes as the original. The actors adopt a style that blends a degree of modern naturalism with the with the melodramatic gestures and expressions of silent film stars. The resulting product is a fine entertainment. While this film could be enjoyed by someone who had never seen the original, I think it will be enjoyed most by those who have seen the silent version, which is a film every horror fan should see anyway.

There is something eerily superb about the film that I just can't explained. The film has inspired many directors in their careers, and even the film [i]Cabinet of Caligari[/i] took elements from the film but wasn't a complete remake. When I first stumbled on David Lee Fisher's sound remake to this film I was intrigued at how closely the look of the film resembled the original. So I eagerly awaited its arrival on DVD.\n \n The amazing thing about this version of [i]The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari[/i] is that it managed to point out all the flaws of the original film, though not intentionally. The story presented in this film works as a silent film, but as a movie with sound you begin to notice just how thin the plot really is. Which made me sad since I couldn't get over how contrived this film felt, despite how much I loved the original film.\n \n The acting in the film makes it feel like this was an amateur  stage performance that was videotaped. None of the actors ever come off as genuine in their performance, and this managed to make me confused onto what was going on... even though I've seen the original many times and know it almost by heart. I will give credit to Doug Jones in his performance of Cesare. Doug Jones is best know for his work in films such as [i]Pan's Labyrinth[/i] and [i]Hellboy[/i]. He is a talented performer, and brings amazing work to each film he is in... even if he is buried beneath make-up and special effects. \n \n I was disappointed with [i]The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari[/i]. Remaking a classic is always risky business, but there have been times where it does work. I was hoping that this remake would work. Maybe if the film didn't try to be a scene for scene remake, just with sound added in, and tried something new, then it is possible this film could have been a great remake.

The best thing was the sets, which, quite literally, the exact same ones since they green screened their actors into the original sets.  The bad part is it is quite noticable at times.  It was an interesting idea, but they took a great movie to begin with and made it into a poorly acted movie with good lighting.  I like the original so much, I kept trying to give this movie a chance, but I found myself wandering off throughout much of the dialog.  I recommend watching the original instead.",

It doesn't even use the many advancements made in the film medium since 1919 to make the offbeat old creeper more frightening to modern audiences the way that Werner Herzog did in his version of \"Nosferatu.\" The actors trudge through the pedestrian, semi-anachronistic dialogue as though they are in an actual silent film - although, in fairness, it mustn't be easy to act in a green-screen void. Anyone who's seen the new \"Star Wars\" trilogy knows that. Nevertheless, if you're a fan of the original, or German Expressionist cinema in general, this little experiment is a worthwhile rent.",
