            "content": "Ugh...\n\nI think there was one part in the movie that actually made me laugh, that is the half of star. Just so you know it was the part where Geoffrey Arend just weirdly slides into the shot to high-five some chick and then weirdly slides back out of the shot. I think that was the only scene that made it feel Lampoonish.*\n\nI don't know why Paris Hilton was doing a voice over in it, that was just one of many things I didn't need in this movie. Actually that would of made it better if she just played her part and there was no voice over. She used to just be someone in the media I couldn't care less about, now I actually dislike her. The things she was saying didn't really make me think there was much need for \"acting\".\nShe kept saying \"hot\" but it just doesn't sound right when she says it, I don't know.\n\nIf you are looking for a good bit of topless action, then come no further, but as a comedy it was (and I can't believe I'm saying this) too much needless topless-ness.\nNeeded to be more subtle. You know, give the guys in the audience an eyeful but don't burn the cornea, or make it painful if they happen to be watching it with a girlfriend. The scenes just kept getting drawn out.\n\n* You know what I'm gonna save you all a lot of time. I'm going back on Netflix and going to pin-point that scene so you can just watch that part and not the rest of the movie. Watch from 57:30 to 58:24 you're welcome.",

And I don't think any movie can EVER beat this one to it..\n\nI watch movies with very low ratings because I do, at times, find some that are a little amusing.. And going into such movies with  0 expectations help too.. But even that didn't help in this case.. I think I watched the first 10 minutes.. Even then, I had constant nagging doubt whether I should stop it then and there or not.. But thought 'd go on, coz 've never left a movie in b/w.. But after 10 minutes, I couldn't stand it anymore and started skipping 2 mins at a time and finished the movie in another 10 minutes.. Yeah, I did waste 20 minutes of my life when I could've watched paint dry.. \n\nParis Hilton is absolutely horrible.. This movie was something like a display of her vanity and thats what makes it so friggin worse.. She can't act, period.. I can't imagine why people'd make movies with her at all.. To all of them, 'get a life'! All that Paris can do is take part in home made videos and make boneheaded statements about how she'll save the economy.. \n\nSome of the girls are hot (Paula Garces in particular, check her out ;) ), but come on, there are so many other things I can watch them in.. The story , hmm, was there a story at all?! \n\nPlease don't watch it, Pleeeeaaaasseee.. Go watch the flower bloom or grass grow..",

        {
            "content": "** WARNING: May contain spoilers **\n\nThis movie features a cavalcade of hot girls, some of whom have graced the cover of Maxim. The fact that the cover art had two hot girls and Paris Hilton (who I shall exclude from \"hot\" because she's not) with midriffs bared and short skirts to boot is what made me think, \"Hey. I could go for watching some hot chicks. That, and Paula Garc\u00e9s is pretty hot alone.\" Don't think like me. Don't watch this movie.\n\nThe movie follows 6 or 7 girls (I didn't stop to count) who would be considered the reject group: the smart girl, the old woman (which was just weird), the foreign exchange girl, the fat girl, the jail girl, the lesbian, DJ/Hip-Hop girl, and probably someone else I'm forgetting who, after a mishap in the dormitories, are forced to find new residence. They try sororities but none of them are a fit. Paris Hilton plays a b*tch who is the leader of one of the \"most beautiful sororities in the country\" so the equivalent of if Cher from Clueless was running it only without the moral compass that occasionally kicks in. In order to win it, she needs to diversify her group and so the \"hilarious\" plot driving job of getting these misfits into her group so she can win while treating them like sh*t in the process. Blah blah blah, nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before.\n\n\"What makes this different?\", you might ask. First off, the plot moves very, very quickly, and not in the good way. More in the way that leaves holes in the road it's traveling on. You find yourself asking, \"Wait...what?\" far to often and random BS, throwaway characters show up out of nowhere to never be seen again ad nauseum. On top of that, characters switch allegiances at the drop of a hat without a real explanation against the character they're trying to make themselves out to be. If there's a character who is a pushover and used to being the doormat and trained to be so for a while, you can't have him suddenly grow a spine in 2 minutes; that's not how it works. Also, these guys who have been trying to get laid the entire movie (using some of the worst ways possible) get together with some of our heroes in the last 5-10 minutes of the movie just by saying \"hi\". Bullsh*t! This actually brings me to the ending of the movie.\n\nThe ending was also incredibly hokey. Along with the guys getting together with the girls at the end of the movie, there is, for some reason, a cameo of Carmen Electra who starts hitting on one of the idiot guys that have been trying to get laid. Assuming Carmen Electra did walk into a room looking to score, this guy would not be anywhere close to making a \"Ooo...that guy's a must\" list, looking more like he stepped out of a steam room filled with weed and being about as coherent and intelligent. Back to the plot, after the inevitable fall of Paris Hilton's character, she suddenly (in the last 2 minutes of the movie) apologizes and says something, nothing short of \"I wasn't loved as a child\". The worst part is that EVERYONE accepts it, they have a group huddle and the voice over (done by Paris where I couldn't figure out if it was her talking or the voice over talking most of the time) talking about how much better it was without her in the limelight. No...no...no...no...and again, no. If she's been made out to be this horrible person the entire movie so much so that everyone in the world turns on her, you can not suddenly have her be this way. While not a plot device, I also have a problem when you force the title of a movie into the dialogue such that the final word uttered by our main protagonist and her new boyfriend is \"Hey Victoria...Pledge This!\"\n\nMaybe I'm more agitated about the plot because I and my friends are what is normally considered \"the outcast group\". I'm fine with being there, so I take exception when they're, not so much the underdogs as they are the blight of this Utopian society, as Paris Hilton's character is trying to make with her blonde haired sorority.\n\nHowever, maybe you're like me and didn't really rent it for the movie plot but more for seeing hot chicks. I don't need nudity for me to enjoy the female body, and the movie does a fine job of letting you see a lot of exposed flesh (I like seeing a midriff. I'm just saying). But let's say you're more into the nudity. There is also a lot of that. Panties always stay on, but shirts and bras have a hard time keeping on their owners. But they have a hard time staying on in on places, like a campus lawn or a classroom. When you have someone rather meekly ask \"What should I do?\" and given the response \"Do your best\" in regards to a Sex Ed teacher, the normal response is not rip off shirt and reveal you weren't wearing a bra that day. That's the kind of sh*t that turned me off from watching porn; the complete disregard to reality. So while you'll be okay if you're the kind of person who wants to see some hot girls and some naked play (rarely outside of a threesome or more), but I'll warn you that the first boobs you see is the middle aged woman's who has had significant surgery on them with the scars and marks along with them. Kinda disturbing really.\n\nBefore I finish this up, I just want to something that happens halfway through the movie. Paris and her boyfriend are going to get frisky while our hero is under his bed trying to avoid detection. The boyfriend dons a construction worker outfit and uses every bad pun in the world (\"I'm gonna screw you\", \"Time to drill\", you get the picture). During this time, Paris is supposed to be having sex with him, but I was distracted during this scene by the fact that she keeps taking the time out to move the sheets. My eyes glued to that point you can see, not once but twice, she still has her panties on. She's spending time on this scene to move the sheets so she can hide it from the camera. Given the fact that she calls him \"small dick\" through the entire movie, I don't think he's getting the penetration that he wants on this one. Now, I'm not a film expert, but if you saw bright red-orange panties flash up, during a sex scene, against a gray-blue bed sheet...wouldn't you have a retake, or get new sheets, or new clothes, or something?\n\nAnyway, this movie is terrible. Just...save yourself the grief. I wish I could get that 90 minutes back.",

I don't understand why Paris Hilton, with all her legions of professional PR people, chooses the worst manuscript ever written.  And even less why National Lampoon, with not that bad track record with the Chevy Chase movies, does the same. Pledge this! is strangely amateurishly made. It consists only of a bunch of badly realized unfunny scenes piled in a sequence. At the end - If you last that long - you are completely fascinated by the complete lack of logic. Not even scenes that are supposed to fit together have continuity. Pledge this! is absolutely incomprehensible. At times I felt I was watching an absurd art movie. Worst. Movie. Ever.",

Paris doesn't quite \"fill-the-stage\" in the lead role and Holly Vallance is wasted as minor character.  The main problem here is probably that it just goes over the same ground as Animal House and a million films that came afterwards, with all the sorority stuff.  It just isn't interesting anymore, guys - get a new boilerplate plot outline - please!  Oh and FHM seem to virtually sponsor the movie, and it's littered with lines promoting the magazine as some kind of wonder publication.

            "content": "Pledge This! is a new film from National Lampoon, and this installment follows along the lines of the other films--a simple plot, good actors, a paper-thin love story, plenty of sight gags, and some sort of villain. This film, however, takes the equation one step further with its quirky characters. The film stars Paris Hilton (House of Wax, The Hillz), Simon Rex (Scary Movie 3, Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th), Sarah Carter (Final Destination 2), Paula Garces (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, Clockstoppers), Geoffrey Arend (The Ringer, Bubble Boy) and many other young, up-and-coming actors and actresses.\r\n\r\nVictoria English (Paris Hilton) is the wealthy, snobbish president of Gamma Gamma sorority at South Beach University in Miami, Florida. When Victoria learns that FHM Magazine is nominating them for \"Best Sorority of the Year\", Victoria plots to have more \"diversified\" co-eds pledge her sorority to integrate her all-blonde and wealthy sorority. One of Victoria's pledges, Kristen Haas (Sarah Carter), suggests they pledge her ex-friend Gloria (Paula Garces) and six of her misfit dorm mates; DJ spinner Monique; an Indian exchange student nicknamed PooPoo; divorc\u00e9e Kathy, who is seeking to relive her youth by going back to college; fat Southern belle Maxine; weird goth girl Babs; and lesbian chick Tonya. The seven pledges are force to go through the most outrageous initiations to be accepted. But when they learn that it was all an act just to get the front cover of FHM magazine, Gloria teams up with Victoria's boyfriend, Derek (Simon Rex), to settle the score.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the acting in Pledge This! is quite solid, but the script is pretty lacking. It just does overused clich\u00e9s one after another until we hit the extremely obvious ending. However, the clich\u00e9s are actually most of what makes this movie work. If this tried to be some original romantic comedy, I couldn't see it working on any level whatsoever. I wasn't expecting much from Paris Hilton, as I had seen her in House of Wax and her acting was so wooden and boring that, basically, I wanted to throw up. However, Paris Hilton somehow manages to surprise? and this is supposed to be direct-to-video fare! I've never really thought that Paris Hilton was very attractive, but in Pledge This!, the lighting, outfits, and hair style that Paris is given really make her stand out. Simon Rex was great as usual--he has rapidly become one of my favorite actors through the very few films that I have seen him in. His acting style is always hysterically funny, and the movie was worth watching just to see what sort of wacky performance he would appear in next. Paula Garces is perfect as Gloria, and the love story between she and Derek was believable, although, again, quite clich\u00e9d. All of the other characters were very creative and fun.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sight gags and nudity, they're in plentiful supply here. One of my favorite scenes had a dog giving Simon Rex a blow job! Classic! There was a lot of female nudity, and while I'm not one to complain, some scenes just felt thrown in there for the sake of nudity alone. I really liked the story; something new filled with old stuff.\r\n\r\nOverall, Pledge This! is a fun movie for what it was--a direct-to-video National Lampoon film that does very little to break from the mold. See this for nudity and laughs, but don't expect a masterpiece.",

Some abysmal acting and the storyline was kind of ridiculous. It could have been better if maybe Paris Hilton wasn't in this? She irked me with her I-think-I'm-hot attitude. I only gave this two stars because some of the scenes, though not all, did somehow alleviated my boredom and made me chortle a little. Also, because there were a couple of gorgeous gilrs in this.",

A direct to DVD flick starring Paris Hilton, Simon Rex, Holly Valance, Randy Spelling, and a slew of others.\n \nStarts off with a sorority, the Gamma Gamma House, led by Victoria English (Hilton) trying to win a contest sponsored by FHM Magazine. The winner gets the cover and crowned 'Hottest Sorority in America'. But in order to win, the sorority must represent a diverse membership, and this is where the less than perfect pledges enter. The movie is narrated by Paris Hilton and shows the various ways she humiliates and manipulates the wannabe Gamma Gamma girls, and ends with their revenge. In the end, everyone \"learns a valuable lesson.\"\n \nWow, was this a dog..... and it is quite obvious why it went direct to DVD. The plot is highly predictable, the acting was...... ughhh, there's just no nice was to put it. Paris Hilton was an Executive Producer on this, which is probably the only reason it was even considered in the first place.\n \nIf it wasn't for the constant barrage of topless women, I would've rated it a '0'.",
