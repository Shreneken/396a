Miranda on top of all of this is a sub-par lyricists who makes decent music. He's a good composer but the lyrics make me want to die.

I thought most of the songs were quite catchy and fun and the choreography is undoubtedly slick. It has a nice flow to it. I knew it was quite contemporary, in terms of the musical styles/genres used, including some rap/hip-hop (though there are numbers which are slower and less frantic) and I supppose it does give it a fresh feel, so to speak. \n\nI can only imagine how much energy you need to appear on stage and take part in only some of this nearly 3 hour long production. Phew. It's certainly an entertaining watch. I can't say I followed the story it tells fully but I get the general idea. I can understand why this is so popular - it definitely has a 'toe-tap' aspect to it, which is a good sign.\n\nI wouldn't say this is entirely amazing or anything but if your a fan of musicals and this sounds of interest, then yes, I'd recommend it as a  live version of a theatrical production, rather than a film set to music as such (if you know what I mean). Its quite long at close to 2 and three quarter hours long but its certainly got a nice beat to it throughout and I thought it was pretty entertaining overall and as I say I'm not someone esp. keen on theatre. Perhaps this isn't entirely brilliant but it's certainly not boring or overly bad, hence it's worth a watch.",

I'd far rather watch a very ambitious film/show/etc that tries and falls a bit short than a conservative, unambitious piece that hits all its targets. The astonishing thing about Hamilton is that not only are its ambitions sky-high, but it also hits just about all of them. Nothing new about it can really be said; it's a wonderful show and this filming does a terrific job of helping it hit home. It's a show that's tailor-made to enjoy with subtitles on, the better to catch the intelligence, wit, and artistic literacy of the songwriting. It's a treat, from start to finish.",

            "content": "'Hamilton' was a major surprise for me when seeing and hearing it. Music is such a big part of my life, being now a semi-professional singer and raised into a musical family, and am a fan of musicals, especially the golden age ones. History was also one of my favourite and best subjects in most of my up and down school life, until it didn't work out in sixth form when my confidence went and my comprehension and drive worsened. So having a musical to combine the two immediately intrigued me, despite not being the biggest fan of the dominant styles here (was raised on classical music and opera personally).\n\nThat is what was meant when saying that 'Hamilton' was a major surprise. Hearing that a filmed version of a production was coming to Disney+, which has been a much needed distraction, there was no doubt in my mind about seeing it. So that the mix of history and music, the meaningful and relevant lyrics, the brilliant performances and the energy and heart it has can be revisited again. It does play fast and loose with history, blame that on the musical and not the production, sure and the style(s) of music that dominates the score here are not my first choices usually, but actually for its entertainment value, emotional impact and how well crafted it is as an overall whole, 'Hamilton' was a real winner. As was this production. Which was very much needed after suffering through 'Artemis Fowl', a musical surprise adapted masterfully and so accessibly and through a particularly unsettling time in a terrible few years.\n\nIt, the production that is, looks great. The sumptuous and true to the respective periods costumes especially and the setting is not too elaborate or overblown while still never looking cheap. Personally thought that the production was very well filmed, certainly compared to other filmed productions of musical theatre, opera and ballet seen and have seen many of each (being a major fan of all three). It made me feel like a member of an audience seeing it live, expect seeing it far more accessibly in terms of money and locations. Which is what is so great about these live/streamed performances and they have proven to be invaluable. Of which 'Hamilton' has been a big highlight.\n\nMusically, 'Hamilton' is on point. Those that don't like the styles are best staying away unless wanting to see what the hoopla is all about, but as someone that saw it with an open mind and wanting to stretch even more my musical horizons 'Hamilton' made me appreciate hip hop and rap much more because they were so well done in their own way. When they are well done and not too repetitive or preachy, yes it is dependent on how they're executed in my view rather than any bias towards the styles, that is when it is easy to appreciate them and that is what 'Hamilton' excels so well in. Also found it very well accompanied.\n\nWhat also comes over brilliantly is how 'Hamilton' is written. The musical and performance are very song heavy, which some may not like dependent on what your feelings on musicals, hip hop and rap are (some love it, others hate it and it is all down to taste which is fair enough). Found the melodies very clever and easy to remember, amazing considering how many there are and not an easy thing to achieve these days. It was the lyrics though that made a bigger impression on me, these lyrics were vastly entertaining and also at times quite emotional but what is just as admirable are their honesty and how relevant they are. These are lyrics that are likely to connect for many, and from the sounds of it have done. Historically, it is far and loose but that didn't matter for me being somebody that watched not expecting a history lesson. 'Hamilton' does very well at making people more interested in history and the particular time periods depicted, that is from my experience from seeing it with people that felt exactly the same as me. What is great about this production is how it does so well in being true and capturing the spirited energy and heart of the musical itself, which is what filmed adaptations of musicals in my mind should do.\n\nReally loved 'Hamilton's' performances. Have seen both love and hate for Lin Manuel Miranda's performance. Personally loved his work here, he was very heavily involved in making 'Hamilton' work, his dilligent efforts very much obvious here, and he gives the equivalent of the performance of his life here. He is charming and has great authority and comic timing and really do disagree that he doesn't have singing ability, he proved in 'Mary Poppins Returns' in my view that he could and he does great in this regard too. Dramatically he is the stuff of legends as is the joy that was Leslie Odom Jr. Daveed Diggs brings tremendous energy in Act 2 especially and Jonathan Groff is absolutely hilarious here. Phillipa Soo and Renee Elise Goldsberry shouldn't be overlooked either, Soo is especially good. Okieriete Onaodowan has great chemistry with Diggs and holds his own against him when they're together, especially as Madison.\n\nConcluding, truly brilliant in my view. It won't be for all tastes but even if one is put off by the first twenty minutes if not knowing what to expect my advice really is to stick with it. It is not worth certainly not bragging about turning it off about 15 minutes or something, that is the equivalent of barely seeing it. One of the easiest 10/10's given recently.",

The people on the island he lives on notices his intelligence and help send him to New York so he can be a new man! \n\nHe goes to school and dreams of fighting in the war but becomes the secretary instead. Washington entrusts him with being a right hand man, but Alexander isn't satisfied and wants more. \n\nAlexander meets the Schuyler sisters and becomes interested in both Angelica, the oldest, and Eliza, his soon to be wife. Eliza falls in love with Alexander at first glance and, with the help of Angelica, they meet and start a romance. Eliza becomes enamored with him but Alexander is stuck on wanting to fight in the war. They send letters to each other and soon become married.\n\nAngelica secretly loves Alexander but loves her sister more so she introduces Alex to Eliza and keeps her love for him a secret. They exchange letters because Alex feels like Angelica understands his drive to rise to the top. With each letter, Angelica wonders if Alex feels something for her. \n\nAlex is given the position he's been wanting and commands his soldiers in the war. It's the end of the war and he embraces his job like the soldier he wanted to be. His friends are scattered around as he leads his troop to victory as the British wave a white flag. They celebrate the end of the war and a new beginning.\n\nAlex struggles to find his place in the new world as he studies law. People are quite overwhelmed by Hamilton's ability to not stop talking. In court, he's hard to keep quiet and his friend, Burr is irritated by it. \n\nAs he gets older, he dabbles in politics, still Washington's right hand man. Jefferson and Madison hate Hamilton with a passion. Burr is jealous of Alex and decides to team up with Jefferson and Madison to dig up dirt on Hamilton. In the end, Alexander writes his own demise and loses the trust and respect of everyone he knows.\n\nLet's not spoil the ending though...",

It certainly had it's moments, energized and engaging, but difficult to sustain that with 2 1/2 hours of rap. I'm no fan of rap or musicals, but I gave it a shot having heard so much about the play, as well as being a history buff. I was somewhat reminded of Jesus Christ Superstar, similar in its mocking treatment of a sober subject, but the Hamilton soundtrack has nothing on the pure genious of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Some have mentioned historical inaccuracies. I didn't notice any, but I did notice important omissions. I believe the reason for the play's popularity is because of the historically turbulent times, as well as the play kind of being a dummied down, abbreviated rap version of early American history, even though I think the sesation seeking audience has little knowledge of history and more of a desire to be entertained by a percieved hip presentation aurally and visually. I noticed that when the characters emphasized minority empowerment, there were knee jerk screams in response, confirming a naieve and superficial responsec. Another major issue is that instead of characters engaing in intimate emotion (why we see stage and film plays) via dialogue, it was a constant historical narrative that just grated after awhile.",

I was raised my whole life watching and loving musicals. This wasn't a musical. There were dancers, costumes, make-up, and audience and music but this was less of a Broadway production and more of a 4th grades classes production of American history written by the middle-aged white teacher as she attempts to show she's \"hip\" and \"down with, like the general vibe and stuff,\" using hip hop. The results; a painfully simplistic, awkward, uncomfortable and condesending string of rhymes more fitting of an health class education video from the late 80's early 90's than a overpriced, Tony Award-winning Broadway Musical of the late 2010's. if the goal is to try and present the America as being more inclusive and progressive, it failed. where it succeeded is continuing the Us Vs Them mentality, only now from the viewpoint of the other side of the table. \"Mr. Pot, I have Mr. Kettle on line one.

            "content": "DIVERSE AND CULTURAL: HAMILTON REVIEW\n\nLook at a ten dollar bill, who is the man in the center? How can we know so little about this man on such a common bill? Hamilton is a Broadway show written by Lin Manuel Miranda, who offers a fresh perspective of one of the lesser known founding fathers and our first secretary of the treasury, Alexander Hamilton. Get ready to bob your head to American history and NO you are not too cool for Broadway because now Broadway is too cool for you! Lin Manuel Miranda uses hip hop style lyrics to tell the story of Alexander Hamilton.\n      Other viewers may overlook certain themes through the show and think that its just about Alexander Hamilton's history and more of an informative show. I disagree and argue that its most important theme is to enlighten us about the importance of immigrants in U.S history. Believe it or not, Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant born in the Caribbean Islands. He is an example and inspiration to immigrants today. The song \"My Shot,\" bags up the attitude of an immigrant. For example, the following lyrics: \"When you're living on your knees, you rise up\" demonstrates the reasons behind immigrating from an impoverished nation to the United States. Immigrants typically feel limited in their home countries, which is a large reason why they choose to immigrate. Another example of this is in the lyric \"The plan is to fan this spark into a flame.\" They know that a simple spark is not enough. They need drive and determination to turn their passion into success.\n       Lin Manuel Miranda illustrates the truth about hip hop. Hip hop is a form of music that most people see as  devalued but they are mistaken because is a very artistic genre of music. Hamilton is not just about boring historical accomplishments, there is rivalry, affairs, love, betrayal and much more drama! With the help of hip hop style lyrics Lin Manuel Miranda accomplishes to intrigue us into the heart of many of the character that is a cause for tears! The lyrics to Satisfied sang by Angelica, played by Ren\u00e9e E. Goldsberry( Schuyler sister) is an example, \"But Alexander, I'll never forget the first time I saw your face I have never been the same Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame And when you said \"Hi, \" I forgot my dang name\" In other words we understand that Angelica is madly in love with Alexander but these lyrics paint how much in love she is and about what she loves about Alexander, she exaggerates forgetting her \u2018dang' name rhyming with same and frame. Hip hop lyric style help us see the dynamic between two characters by figurative language and rhyme an example of this is in the song Aaron Burr, sir, \"Good luck with that, you're takin' a stand You spit, I'ma sit We'll see where we land (boo)(Aaron Burr played by Leslie Odom Jr.) Burr, the revolution's imminent, to what do you stall for? If you stand for nothing Burr, what'll you fall for?(Alexander Hamilton played by Lin Manuel Miranda) this explains the different mindset and opinions that these two rivals had with each other.\n     Finally, Hamilton is more than just a history lesson, but an important revelation for all viewers  about the different perspectives of things that can sometimes be overlooked like the importance of immigrants or that sometimes hip hop is more than swaying your hips to the beat. Also, Don't let this diverse and cultural Broadway show intimidate you because we learn such a shocking lesson that Hamilton is a reminder that history is still being written.",

In short? A musical that's worthy of the acclaim that it has garnered over the past 5 years that might even be more relevant today than it might have been back in 2015.

This musical wasn't enough to make me change my opinion about musicals, but it's definitely my favorite musical now. I think that's because most musicals and especially musicals in movies (Basically almost all modern Disney movies) try to blend drama and musical together, and it just doesn't work for me. But because Hamilton IS a straight up musical and wasn't pretending it wasn't, it worked for me. Anyway, the songs and characters are freaking AWESOME and this musical is entertaining as hell. If you are a history buff you should definitely check this out. My only two complaints are 1. the musical overall was a little too long for me (It's over two and a half hours long) and 2. The songs that I wanted to be longer were really short and the songs that I wanted to be shorter were really long and that caused the musical to drag a little bit. But the scene that follows usually picks up the pace and keeps the musical going. This musical lives up to all and I mean ALL the hype and I think that it's so worth the watch, even if you aren't a big musical fan like me.",

With his latest feature, director Thomas Kail has crafted a breathtaking rendition of the beloved Broadway play. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to film a live recording of a beloved stage musical, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Kail draws viewers into the whimsical world of Hamilton. From intimate close-ups to gorgeous overhead shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the theatrical setting. The musical numbers, costumes and choreography are all carefully crafted, combining to create an immersive theatrical experience. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is at the top of its game. Lin-Manuel Miranda delivers his finest performance to date as Alexander Hamilton. With riveting expressions, he conveys the bravery, nobility and larger-than-life nature of the iconic character. The supporting cast, which includes the scene-stealing Leslie Odom Jr., is also excellent and worthy of recognition. Although \"Hamilton\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At nearly three hours, it is slightly long and suffers from a lengthy running time. Nevertheless, fans of the original Broadway production will definitely enjoy \"Hamilton\" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. At a time when Broadway remains shut down in the COVID-19 pandemic, it's a stirring reminder that beloved stage musicals are worth recording live to audiences around the world.",

And they do a very good job of keeping the live stage vibe while also taking advantage of multiple cameras with close ups and perspective changes at the right time to help enhance the emotion of a scene without overdoing it. The show is an extremely creative retelling of Hamilton's life and efforts surrounding the Revolution and the founding of our nation, almost completely told in songs that run the musical genre gambit, even including a few rap battles. And what an interesting life it was, they pack a lot in to this story but it's nicely paced. There were very few lulls, and the King George bits (which were probably my favorite) helped add a bit of levity just when you needed it. Making almost the entire cast people of color was a real power move, and there were some neat and creative technical things they did on stage like the rotating floor that helped add some extra elements of mobility. I wouldn't say I'm a huge musical person, but this was very entertaining.",

Don't think you are going to watch any normal movie \u2013 treat this as a valuable piece of theatre. \n\nThe first thing you will notice is the complex but not too hard to follow lyrics, going outside of typically used rhyme structures, and even when the lyrics are really simple they are beautifully simple and symbolic. The songs are mostly connected through a series of musical and lyrical motifs, which is excellently used as foreshadowing in My Shot. The multi-genre score is sometimes quiet, sad and thought-provoking while other times loud, vigorous and rowdy but always terrific. \n\nIn terms of historical inaccuracies, there are only a few and are used to dramatize the story, but it's just a google click away to learn more.\nChoreography-wise there are some amazing moments that happen in the show. Of course, these moments would be better experienced live, but only so much is possible with television. You can try to turn up your volume and watch on a bigger screen to create a live-theatre-vibe. \n\nThe cast members are all amazing, and despite the titular role being a good-not-amazing singer he can act, rap, and write a heck of a musical. The whole cast can act very well even just in the subtle nuances. \n\nIf you are hearing impaired you can turn on the English language subtitles so you don't miss the awesome lyrics. Shockingly, there are some very politically relevant things brought up in this musical set in the 17 and 1800s that came out in 2015 and not just things that apply to America but other countries too. \nBesides the political stuff there is another very emotional main message I will not mention in case you decide to watch this film. In a nutshell, Hamilton is amazing and we can all take something out of it.",

Additionally, there was a noticeable difference between the songs that were given a lot of time and attention versus the parts where it was just talking in a sing-song manner. If the characters are going to be talking in a sing-song manner-- likely because there wasn't a strong melody, rhyme or meter to put there-- I prefer to just have the character talk regularly. Don't just force a song where you don't have one. Other than that, I enjoyed the humor, and I can appreciate the amount of effort that went into something like this.",

But with the pandemic and with already having a Disney+ subscription, I sat down to watch this production. I was immediately hooked. I'm not a fan of rap music, so of course do not appreciate the nods that Lin-Manuel Miranda has expertly weaved into his amazing libretto. But I can appreciate that the amazing actors are able to enunciate the words with such clarity, yet breathtaking speed, that you can understand perfectly what is going on, even if its sometimes a feeling and an impression, rather than taking in and being able to understand the meaning  behind each and every syllable. In many ways I felt like watching Shakespeare, where I don't necessarily understand every word, but perfectly understand the intent that the author is trying to get across, through the staging and action. This is definitely a production that bears repeated watching or listening to, as I for one have picked up additional nuances each time. Since watching for the first time \nI've become semi-obsessed - listening to the soundtrack in the car, watching behind the scenes videos on YouTube, and reading the excellent Hamilton the Revolution book. Incidentally in the book and elsewhere Miranda addresses many of the criticisms levelled at his script. This is not a historically accurate documentary. It does not spend time dwelling on the fact that many of the American founding fathers were not nice people. Jefferson is criticised for the South building their wealth on the back of slave labour, but fellow slave-owner Washington is put on a pedestal. Should Miranda be criticised for the decisions to cut songs that more explicitly deal with the discussions raging even at that time over slavery, and the fragile compromises required to keep the Union together in the early days? I don't think so. Anybody dealing with 30 years of history in under 3 hours is going to have to pick which themes to concentrate on. This is just an astounding piece of entertainment and art. I'm looking forward to theatres opening up so that I can try to see it live, but capturing this performance, by this group of actors, in such a brilliant way, and then having it available at no extra charge through a streaming service I was already paying for?

This professional recording of the original Broadway cast came much earlier than anticipated in the show's success with unbeatable vocals, crisp and clear cinematography and songs that tell the Hamilton's and the Founding Fathers' stories in an unheard of mechanism. Some may argue that real genius behind Hamilton isn't just in the diversification of cast/characterization or even in the use of hip hop & rap to weave this narrative. But rather, the use of our nation's original story to highlight how we leave our mark on society and the good/bad that we still face today. Hamilton is an absolute must-see and a real treat to exist as a live recording on a streaming service just 4 years after it's inception.",

            "content": "Let\u2019s start by prefacing this review with how I was approaching this \u201cfilm,\u201d because I think that context is important in this case. For starters, I\u2019m not a big fan of rap or hip-hop, and I\u2019m pretty sure at some point in my life I made some old man statement about that stuff \u201cnot being real music.\u201d Since I heard that most of the music in Hamilton was inspired by those genres, I was fairly confident this wouldn\u2019t be for me, despite the fact that I typically love musicals. Then there\u2019s the over-abundance of gushing that people have done about the show and its music for 5 years, including a huge uptick in conversation months before this release. I heard stories of people willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for tickets, and still struggling to get a seat. With that kind of hype it\u2019s inevitable that the actual production can\u2019t possibly live up to expectations. Friends of mine had even found their way to a touring version of the show, and told me they felt ripped off for having paid that kind of money for the show they got. At this point, I had pre-determined in my head that this movie would be overrated, and I was loading up both barrels to unleash a storm of hate on it. Admittedly, I was paying nothing to watch it (thanks to Disney+,) but I still expected disappointment. When I began watching this filmed version of the Broadway musical, I was fairly confident all my trepidation was warranted. The opening number was spitting rhymes at me with such speed and in a rhythm that I could not comprehend more than a handful of words. I was struggling not only to understand the specific lyrics they were rapping, but also to get the overall point of them. (I know, my old age is really showing now.) As a result, less than 5 minutes into the show, I rewound to the beginning and turned on the closed-captions. This definitely helped me to follow the story, even though I still wasn\u2019t particularly fond of that opening number. But this is where I admit...from there on, the musical won me over. I found myself smiling and enjoying parts of the show, and I even hummed along with some of the tunes when they hit a familiar refrain. I was having a good time, and said out loud \u201cUh oh, this is actually good.\u201d It does help that the entire film is not rap or hip-hop. In fact, the bulk of it plays more like a traditional Broadway musical, and I\u2019m a sucker for big numbers like these. They even include some of those brilliant layered songs where they merge a few of the different character songs into one big bombastic number. There are still elements that I don\u2019t love about Hamilton. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy when a story tells you how it will end at the beginning. Even if these things are common knowledge because it\u2019s a historical film, I don\u2019t love when someone just spells out the conclusion in the first minutes of the movie. I\u2019m also not a fan of biopics that detail such massive periods of time. I\u2019ve always preferred when a movie focuses on a more specific event and creates an entire arc that way, rather than showing the full life of the protagonist. Because of this, I often felt like Hamilton was rushing, and the plot wasn\u2019t given enough time to breathe in any one moment in history. I sometimes struggled to see the importance of certain events and wondered why some subplots were included at all. It\u2019s also interesting that I didn\u2019t particularly love Alexander Hamilton as a character. He was somewhat unpleasant and abrasive, and frankly Lin-Manuel Miranda was far from the best actor/singer on stage. Despite the difficulties I had with the show, I still have some of the melodies stuck in my head days after watching it. My expectations were that I would hate this specially-filmed version of the stage musical, and I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, I\u2019ll probably watch Hamilton again.",

Now I know that a masterpiece pushes an era forward.

The script too was so easy to follow with the right amount of humor and seriousness. The scenes filled perfectly with drama, suspense, romance, comedy, tragedy, it had all elements for emotional reactions and done so, so perfectly!!

If a bit long winded, structurally, Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s musical lyricism succeeds in connecting the known present with the forgotten past, tightly weaving musical motifs across the entire viewing and sending out a universal message of how one can either confirm their own legacy or damn it all to hell with one choice. The company of Hamilton brings the libretto to life in weird but rather effective choreography and in sound tone. Finally, the main Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton, with props to Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr., Daveed Diggs, Rene\u00e9 Elise Goldsberry, Christopher Jackson, Jasmine Cephas Jones, Anthony Ramos, Okieriete Onaodowan, Jonathan Groff, and Philippa Soo, are matches made only in dreams as they transcend in singing across the stage and envelope into these characters that may or may not be what history makes them out to be.",

Behind the stage, Lin Miranda Emmanual crafts a brilliant musical with catchy songs while also staying fairly close to history, covering Alexander Hamilton's impoverished background, brilliance, adultery and ultimate death at the hands of Aaron Burr (a brilliant Leslie Odom Jr.).  The multi-racial cast is a brilliant touch, as it ultimately shows the founding fathers belonged to all Americans, no matter their race, while also nailing their personalities for modern audiences.

Hamilton respected the viewer's theater seat view. The singing was good (Lin Manuel Miranda's voice is not the best as even he admits) to great (especially Eliza, played by Phillipa Soo). TGFC ... thank goodness for captions. The rap has words flying by. I surely would have lost more than half the story without captions. Most of the costuming was a perfect representation of the time and the dancers' skin-tight suits worked so well when the choreography called for ballet-like moves. I especially liked those when the stage's turntable floor was turning. Brilliant! I was entertained and educated. And I was delighted to see people cast without regard to skin color.

From what I understand, it mixes footage from a live performance and separately filmed close-ups. This is a wonderful show!\n\nThe story in this is an engrossing look at one man's life and death, his tremendous highs and lows. Besides being dramatic, the clever lines in this can also be pretty funny.\n\nThe songs in this are truly unique. This presentation shows why Hamilton is the biggest musical of the decade. It accomplishes something that appears to be rarer and rarer in recent decades: every song is a winner. This is especially impressive since this is a song-only musical with basically no spoken dialogue.\n\nThe one part of this show that could be an issue for some is that singing and exposition can go by pretty quickly, especially in the first fifteen minutes, and you could miss something.\n\nThe choreography and staging are also great, not to mention very creative at times. The dancing really accentuates the story and songs. The set rather than changing scenes takes the minimalist route of having one basic set and the use of body movement, props, and a couple other stage aspects in order to tell the story. It's all so complex and fascinating to watch.\n\nThe performances in this are top-notch all-around. I've heard and seen a lot of comments that Lin Manuel-Miranda (the lead and creator of this) isn't as strong a singer as the rest of the cast, however it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. (Though by now, I'm sure plenty of people on stage have.) He just pulls off the man's drive so well in such a passionate manner. Going back to the show's sense of humor and unique interpretations, we are treated to a couple of delightfully flamboyant turns from Daveed Diggs and Johnathan Groff (from Frozen and Mindhunters).\n\nThe nice thing about this compared to seeing the show live on stage is that the close-up shots allow you to truly get a good look at the actors' expressions. (Though once in a while since the blocking is done in relation to talking in the direction of an audience, the actors can be facing the camera at an odd angle. It's not a big issue.)\n\nOverall, I can not recommend this tremendous work enough.",

Basically, catching the play on stage, the audience that is cheering and clapping, and the set design and lighting. The musical sequences are pretty fairly entertaining with flashy set pieces. And the dance choreographer is well done. I did find the movie to be overly long with its running time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. Showing every detail of the musical. While some of the repetitive musical sequences could have been trimmed and not affect anything with the story it is trying to tell. The cast is great. Lin Manuel Miranda did a great job. It does have a few good musical sequences. A good story. It may have overused a few musical sequences which added to its over long run time. Watching this did make it feel like you got the vip seat in theatre. Which they should try to bring other plays onto the big screen.",

I waited until 2 am for it to come on Disney Plus and it was SO WORTH IT!! I laughed, I cried, I danced and I sang to this whole movie! I get so hype just listening to the soundtrack, but seeing come to life on screen and seeing the characters actually perform and all of the choreography, just brought the whole show to a whole new level of amazing! I could go on and on for hours about how great this production was and how each and every actor and actress in Hamilton brought their own talent and character to the show and made it what it was!

The performances are spectacular, with the two female leads singing a couple of show-stoppers, and King George nearly steals the show.\n\nThe staging itself is something to behold.  The rotating stage is nothing short of genius, and helps show movement as well as one amazing flashback that is staged in a truly genius manner.\n\nI didn't see any way this could live up to the hype, but it goes past the hype and into the stratosphere.

You get to visually experience nuances on the screen you couldn't possibly in person at the theater. The cast will make you laugh, cry, sing right along with them. L-LM does an amazing job of keeping his vision 95% historically accurate. This is NOT a political production. We, as a country, will hopefully always be moving towards forming a more perfect union. Hamilton shares that our founding fathers were less than perfect people, all striving to live better lives. It does give a message that to this day we are still striving towards. For now, enjoy the masterpiece that Hamilton is. Must see? Absolutely! Having watched it four times since its D+ release on 7/3/2020, it just keeps getting better. Again, wish I could tell you this in person, thank you so very much Lin-Manuel Miranda. When YOUR story is told, it will be with appreciation and love for this masterpiece.

Presenting the production in this format, essentially a conventional rendition of the stage play with some well-designed camerawork, asks an interesting question regarding potential depictions of Broadway hits in film. The deluge of classic stage adaptations that essentially simply design conventional sets but replicate the dialogue and music word-for-word now look to be something of a Hollywood cash-in on the intellectual property of others, even lesser than consistent franchise sequels as they require precisely zero creativity. Presenting Hamilton in its original configuration does not infringe on its impact and requires not an ounce of producer intervention, and the results speak for themselves. I'm not sure it can be effectively counted as a film instead of a recording in another medium, at best it's a hybrid of the two. Will we see more of this format in the future? I hope so. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "Multi-hyphenate sensation Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton sounds like a bizarre misfire, a hip-hop-infused musical about one of the lesser known Founding Fathers, and yet not only does it succeed so magnificently, so transcendentally, it's one of those rare artistic pinnacles that lives up to its own momentous hype. This is one of the crowning artistic achievements of the twenty-first century. I'm exceedingly grateful for a filmed version of the vaulted stage experience, with the original cast, that allows me that front-row view my bank account never would afford. This is going to be a film review of what is, essentially, a live theatrical performance, but really this written review is going to be a celebration of Hamilton and what I consider to be so phenomenal.\n\nIn 1776, Alexander Hamilton (Miranda) is an immigrant to looking to make his name in the American colonies and the looming war with Britain for independence from King George III (Jonathan Groff). He meets and befriends Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom Jr.), an ambitious upstart who seems fatefully linked with Hamilton through the decades. Hamilton falls in love and marries Eliza Schuyler (Phillipa Soo) but also has a close relationship with her older sister, Angelica (Renee Elise Goldsberry), who keeps her real feelings at bay to protect her sister. Eager to get into the action, Hamilton accepts a position as George Washington's (Chris Jackson) right-hand man as the battle comes to New York and the colonists do the unthinkable and defeat England as we conclude the musical's first act. \"You'll be back,\" King George retorts.\n\nNext comes the tricky part of building a functioning country in the aftermath. Hamilton is appointed to be Secretary of the Treasury by newly elected President Washington, but his federalist principles are fought against by some pretty big names in the cabinet, like James Madison (Okieriete Onaodowan) and Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs). Both are wary of a centralized government and prefer more power to be held by the states. The Founding Fathers jostle for ideological supremacy and Hamilton gifts his opponents with the burgeoning nation's first political sex scandal with Maria Reynolds (Jasmine Cephas Jones). Aaron Burr rises in local and national politics but sees Hamilton as a constant thorn in his side. With the presidential election so close in 1800, Hamilton's endorsement of Jefferson over Burr is the final straw, and Burr demands satisfaction in a duel against Hamilton that will prove tragic.\n\nFor fans of musical theater, Hamilton is a two-hour-forty-minute joyously exuberant celebration of a bold artistic vision, the electricity of live theater, and broadening American history in a manner that makes it far more accessible, relevant, and humane for a modern audience. The very nature of having minority actors portraying the Founding Fathers and their famous wives is part of Miranda's appeal that he wanted to tell the story of America with the America of today. Ordinarily, African-Americans would never get an opportunity to play Washington or Jefferson, or a Chinese-American woman playing the role of Eliza Hamilton, and there is definite power in representation, in seeing these different faces playing these historical figures. The deliberate color-blind casting makes America's history feel more inclusive. It's such a simple act, opening the ethnicity of historical roles, but it produces a beautiful result and provides even more cross-textual commentary, like slave-owning presidents played by black thespians.\n\nAnother miraculous effort by Miranda is his ability to generously humanize many of the characters, including the man who eventually murders Hamilton himself. Very often when we talk about the Founding Fathers and other Great Figures of History from oh so long ago, they take on a mythic quality and seem less human, less flawed, and less relatable. They seem practically superhuman, absent our doubts and desires. Miranda's portrayal of the men and women of America's founding does the opposite and makes these people feel relatable, flawed, and human yet again.\n\nThis includes Hamilton as well. He's obsessed with his sense of legacy, has a pretty healthy ego that gets him into trouble, and might have been having an emotional affair with his sister-in-law, never mind an actual affair with Maria Reynolds. He's so concerned about his \"good name\" and rumor of impropriety (he was accused of embezzling government money to pay for Ms. Reynolds' husband's extortion) that he literally confessed to his marital misdeeds and published it. Hamilton is consumed with writing his ideas (\"Why do you write like you're running out of time?\") and an impending early death, something he amazingly escaped during a hurricane in the Caribbean that destroyed his village as well as his mother's fatal illness. He was so eager to get into the heat of war that Washington had to sit him down to persuade him that dying as a martyr isn't as glamorous as living and seeing through your ideals. Hamilton's death at the hands of Burr is likely the most widely known fact about both duelists, but the musical brings each to glorious and troubled life with unerring compassion without excusing their real failings.\n\nBurr serves as the narrator of our near three hours, setting the stage for Hamilton's story with his own regrets and jealousies framing his recounting. He's a complex character worthy of his own biopic, an orphan who finished college in two years, had an affair with the wife or a British officer, lost her at sea, and championed retail politics centuries before it was the norm. His personal philosophy was one of caution, diametrically opposed to Hamilton jumping after whatever he wanted no matter the consequences. Burr longs for being near the real center of power, and his showstopping number \"The Room Where It Happens\" is an ode to his desire. He begins as a friend and ally of Hamilton, then political rival, and finally as a mortal enemy. He's too calculated with his personal beliefs, never wanting to be too challenging and at risk, which is an embodiment of his social-climbing ambition as well as his callow decision-making. To Burr, avoiding risk and not accruing enemies is simply smart business. The musical does an excellent job of humanizing Burr (\"Now I'm the villain in your history book\") and offering a perspective in opposition to Hamilton but not without its own measurable merits.\n\nThe domestic side of Hamilton could be its own movie to itself. The relationship between Alexander, Eliza, and Angelica is complicated to say the least. Angelica was the elder sister and in her stellar song \"Satisfied\" she details the social pressures of being in that position, being expected to marry into a desirable match that will see the family name and fortune to prosper. Feeling initially unsure about Hamilton's intentions, she introduces him to her sister Eliza instead, and it's a choice that she feels conflicted about ever since. Angelica dearly loves her sister (\"I love my sister more than anything in this life/ I will choose her happiness over mine every time\") but cannot help but still feel a yearning for her brother-in-law. However, when the Reynolds scandal comes to light, she will defend her sister to her dying breath. That sisterly deference makes Angelica such a fascinating figure, and it certainly makes the Hamilton marriage more intriguing and roiling with pent-up desires. Eliza sings about removing herself from the narrative in \"Burn\" and how her husband has \"forfeited the rights to my heart.\" She's been trying to impress upon her husband to be happy in the moment (\"Look around, look around/ How lucky we are to be alive right now\") and enjoy his accomplishments rather than looking ahead. Her eventual forgiveness of Hamilton is one of the most emotional moments of the show that causes me to tear up. And she serves as a final testament to Hamilton's legacy during the final number, after his death, and fills in the gaps of history by asserting her own agency back into the observed \"narrative.\"\n\nI've gone over 1300 words, dear reader, and I haven't even talked in depth about the music, so allow me to say that Hamilton as a musical is just about music perfection. Hip-hop is such a densely wordy platform that allows so much information to be imparted at lightning speed, which means that lyrically these songs are jam-packed with clever asides, allusions, and rhyming recitations of history. The songs are instantly quotable and filled with deep consideration from witticisms to also important dramatic themes and perspectives. I was amazed at Miranda's composition skills in particular how he's able to weave and build off character leitmotifs. It's brilliant how something like Hamilton's declarative early song \"Not throwing away my shot\" about his ambitions can come back during his duel with Burr where he raises his pistol in the air, away from Burr, and literally throws away his shot. Or how the beat of a song can imitate a failing heartbeat in a fractious moment of tragedy. Or how King George's self-involved songs are fashioned to be like 1960s British invasion pop ditties. Or how cabinet arguments become riotous battle raps between Jefferson and Hamilton. Or how the same actors who played Hamilton's wartime buddies in Act 1 are playing his political rivals in Act 2 (\"Have you forgotten Lafayette?\" he asks of Jefferson, the same man who portrayed Lafayette). There are layers and layers to the compositions here and the music is remarkably assured; almost every song is a certified earworm, and it's an entirely sung musical. Every person will have their favorites, and for me they include \"Satisfied,\" \"The Room Where It Happens,\" \"History Has Its Eyes on You,\" \"Dear Theodosia,\" \"One Last Time,\" and the moving finisher, \"Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story.\" Even if you don't like rap music, Miranda's offerings are so catchy, so accomplished, and so bursting with excitement, that it's near impossible to resist.\n\nThis movie was filmed in 2016 from the original Broadway cast, many of whom earned Tony awards for their sensational work (Diggs, Goldsberry, and Odom Jr.). Everyone is truly excellent but my favorite performer, by far, is Diggs (Blindspotting). He gets to spit lightning-fast rhymes in a French accent as Lafayette, and his portrayal of Jefferson as a dandy in the style of Andre 3000 from Outkast is enormously entertaining. His \"What Did I Miss?\" introductory number is a perfect impression for Jefferson's arrival onto the stage. Diggs' is so charming even when he's being a scoundrel trying to plot the doom of Hamilton. His battle raps with Miranda are a highlight and Diggs also seems to get the most tricky lyrical arrangements because of his peerless skills at maintaining flow and diction (\"I'm in the cabinet, I am complicit in/ Watching him grabbin' at power and kiss it/ If Washington isn't gon' listen/ To disciplined dissidents, this is the difference./ This kid is out!\"). There's a reason Diggs has become the other breakout star of the show.\n\nSoo (The Code) breaks my heart with her Act 2 solo numbers and then mends it back as she reasserts herself on \"Who Live, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story.\" Goldsberry (Altered Carbon) has such a fire to her. Groff (Mindhunter) is hilarious as King George, though his singing involves a lot of literal spitting. Miranda (Mary Poppins Returns) is exceptional as the titular character who comes from nothing and through the power of his ideas creates America's financial institutions that are still standing to this day. But it's his personal relationships that better define him in the play. The fatherly relationship he has with Washington is affectionate (\"One Last Time\" has an extra poignancy knowing Washington died shortly after leaving office) and his hopes for his newborn son (\"You'll Blow Us All Away\") speak to a larger truth about parenting that also links up with the foundation of a nation in infancy. There's also his complicated love divided between Eliza and her sister. Miranda has such a natural charm and swagger and earnestness that seeps into his performance and every performer.\n\nSo is there anything about this movie-wise to separate it from a bootleg of the show? Director Thomas Kail (also the director of the musical) does make smart use of when to go tighter on his actors, to zero in on the emotions and expressiveness, and when to go wider for best impact. The stage is designed like a bullseye with a rotating circle, which can play up the dramatic confrontations between foes, especially the duels. I was impressed at points where the movement of the stage would be perfectly timed with camera focus and edits, allowing other characters to loom over the shoulder, or pop into focus, giving the production a greater sense of filmed visuals. However, this is really a filmed version of the stage show, so as a movie, it's only going to do so much with those trappings. The unreality of theater has to be accepted but the movie version does a great job of maintaining the intimacy of the shared theatrical experience. It's even nice to hear the applause after the musical numbers or some of the laugh lines hit home.\n\nBy this time, you've likely heard about the Broadway-smashing Hamilton success story of Miranda and his crew but do yourself a real favor and watch the movie with the OG cast. Yes, there are historical shortcuts taken for dramatic license and not everything you see on stage will be one hundred percent accurate with the long record of history, but it all clicks for the greater storytelling aims. Some might be uncomfortable with the re-visioning of the Founding Fathers, either by the open-ethnicity casting or glossing over their slave-owning faults, but Miranda's larger goal of making history reflective of the people who currently live today is admirable. In short, unless you have the kind of money to blow on a front-row ticket, enjoy the Hamilton movie experience until Miranda eventually wrangles his artistic milestone into a more movie-movie version.\n\nMovie Grade: A\n\nShow Grade: A+",

In every nuance: close ups, dance moves, even angles never seen by any audience, how is it ever smooth, cohesive and crystal clear? The answer: director Thomas Kail, who is experienced in television and film as well as theatre, and who directed both Hamilton and Lin Manuel Miranda's previous Broadway hit, In the Heights. Kail intimately understands how to glean the best essential Hamilton. The performers all had a year of live shows under their belts, therefore this is one of the most thoroughly rehearsed films yet is spot on energy wise. The ensemble work is very strong. The Greek chorus are present almost always, acting all background and minor roles, switching character constantly with the precision of Andy Blackenbuehler's choreographed dance language. Clearly every character is integral and motivated from the lead to the bullet (yes, one of the chorus is briefly the bullet that kills Hamilton); every cast member and every dance move support lyrics, story and action. The production is visually striking, lighting and design also support the story yet reflect the period. The clothes are exquisite. The writing is cerebral, profound hilarious, emotional and timely. The voices blend beautifully and are lovely individually. The quality of singing is top notch, all of it. Principals Leslie Odom Jr, Daveed Diggs, Christopher Jackson, and Renee Elise Goldsberry and Philippe Soo are powerful and evocative. Anthony Ramos is convincingly Hamilton's closest friend and as his son seems actually to have de-aged to a boy of 9. Jasmine Cephas Jones has the sultry chops to carry the femme fatale Mrs Reynolds. Lin Manuel Miranda's emotion has me in tears at numerous points; with love and grief he shares with wife Eliza, and what here in Ireland we call the gr\u00e1, or yearning fondness and matched wit he shares with her sister Angelica. And then there's the music! (You've probably heard?) Its stunning. \nBest of filmed musicals, best of cocooning remedies.\nPS Watch out for one of the chorus, Ariana DeBose, who will play Anita in Spielberg's forthcoming West Side Story.",

He was seemingly crafted this show and he has done a tremendous job\n\nThe writing of the songs is fantastic and they are soooo catchy \n\nSet design was brilliant and seeing this stage production through a camera was really enticing and left me wanting more \n\nFunny in parts, sad in others. I felt \u2018Hamilton' had a great balance\n\nPerformances by everyone was fantastic... words don't do it justice\n\nLafayette - Hilarious\n\nCons\n\nNot many... But I did become a little confused with some plot points, that may have just been me though\n\nOverall, I thought \u2018Hamilton' was an absolute blast. The songs, performances were truly amazing and I will be listening to the soundtrack for a while now! Hats off to Lin-Manuel Miranda because he has crafted this from the ground and wrote the lyrics to the songs and the script. Honestly it is a fantastic achievement for him. I've never been a massive fan of musical theatre but \u2018Hamilton' has proved to me that there are some gems out there. I hope Disney or other companies release future productions on streaming sites because I can guarantee \u2018Hamilton' will be a wide success.\n\nQuote \u2013 \"I'm not throwing away my shot\" \u2013 Alexander Hamilton\n\nRating \u2013 9/10",

It is heavily reliant on music perhaps like other musicals, not very action-packed, and not much dialogue. I do not even find musicals interesting in the slightest. I am not much into Hamilton. I can honestly say from my perspective that Hamilton is for die-heart fans, or normal (not die heart) fans of Hamilton and other musicals only. And although i really wanted to like Hamilton, i do not, and i do not tend to watch the rest. If any of you guys like musicals including Hamilton, good for you!

Not only does it embrace being filmed, but the direction by Thomas Kail and cinematography by Declan Quinn is breathtaking and adds a whole new dimension to the beloved musical. \n\nIf you're a Hamilton connoisseur, you'll get to experience this groundbreaking musical from an all-new angle.

I cried, I laughed and really enjoyed the original cast at their best.  Lin looked a bit tired in a few scenes but I learned they filmed this is 3 days and every waking moment was spent getting the close ups and everything perfect, which they did!  I have listened to the Original Cast sound track so many times and it was fantastic to see who were behind those voices.  I was really impressed with Anthony Ramos performance and was surprised how many scenes he seemed to steal.  I knew Daveed Diggs killed his 2 parts and of course Lin and the rest of the cast but his voice and acting ability stunned me.  Thank you Lin and of course Disney for releasing this early, there is so much to learn from this and I believe it is a movie that will go down in American history for centuries.  I am waiting for the sequel....perhaps Washington or Franklin??  I truly believe this is the greatest piece of art I have ever seen and will never forget it.  There are a lot of words, and sometimes they can be spoken very quickly, every time I see it I hear and learn something new.  Enjoy!",
