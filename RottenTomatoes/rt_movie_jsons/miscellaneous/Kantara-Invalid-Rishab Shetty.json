            "content": "Knowing nothing about India's religion or culture, I'll only talk about the entertaining value of this movie. Only after watching it, I knew the main actor is the writer, and director as well, and I was quite impressed because his performance as actor was trully stunning. This movie is very well done, there's no filler content, it has unexpected turns which got me shocked, and it has some little humor as well. In short, it's intriguing, engaging, and magical. It was a pleasure to watch",

And thanks that I have come to know about Bhagwan Panjuri \ud83d\ude4f, I will visit the village and the region someday in the near future.",

The movie is elevated beyond anything, only through the last 10 minutes of acting. This moment, I may never forget!\u00a0 I had goosebumps through the climax. I re-watched it a little over 10 times. I recommend it.\n\nFor complete review, follow the link\nhttps://beeafteryou.com/2023/02/07/kantara-a-review/",
