        {
            "content": "A very nicely executed drama filled with bitter realism about modern-day Bulgaria and, perhaps, the Balkans in general. Corruption and inequality seem to triumph causing honest people who believe in any kind of fairness or justice to be seen at least as dumb, if not dangerous or manipulable. This only leads towards one direction: the film's final\u00e9 cleverly shows that.",
