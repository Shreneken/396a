    "summary": "Anton Bartok (Lee Richardson), the CEO of a research laboratory, acts as the self-appointed guardian of orphan Martin Brundle, whose father had been a researcher at the lab. Though Martin is scarcely five, he has the appearance of a 20-year-old (Eric Stoltz) because of mutant insectoid genes in his system. Martin grows up confined to the laboratory, unaware of his true nature, with only pretty scientist Beth Logan (Daphne Zuniga) to call a friend. Soon, the fly within begins to emerge.",

That will be a gold mine to the one who can make it work.  But what money is in genetic mutations?  What money can fly men monster bring?  The movie never really explains that.  Scientific curiosity wasn't exactly a character trait they gave Bartock.  Also the monster Martin turns into is kinda cool but looks more b-movie than what I'm guessing would be at least a medium to high budget movie.  Lastly I know Martin is a kid in an adult's body but that doesn't mean he has to be a bratty Kenny kid.  But overall, I did enjoy it more than the original.  But only slightly.",

Eric Stoltz makes the most of his lines while demonstrating vulnerability, pathos and rage at being the unwitting product of his father's work. \n\nWhile not reaching the intense levels of its predecessor, 'The Fly 2' makes for a fine bookend to the saga of 'The Fly'.",

            "content": "I remember watching this on VHS when it first came out and not being all that impressed. However, if you look at the writing credits, there are some pretty solid writers, Mick Garris (creator of \"Master of Horror\" , Jim & Ken Wheat (co-writers of \"Pitch Black\" [though I think director/co-writer David Twohy gets most of the credit on that one]), and Frank Darabont (writer/director of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and creator of \"The Walking Dead\"), so I went into this re-watching film with some new hope. The film starts out well with the offspring of Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis from the first film being raised by a research facility. The child grows at an accelerated rate and in five years grows into Eric Stoltz, who is a genius and is the only one who seems to understand his father's teleportation research and is continuing his research for the company who is holding him. The film starts out well, with Stoltz thinking the research facility is treating him as a scientist, but he slowly realized he's really just a highly intelligent lab rat. The film sadly then goes down the road of standard horror film gore and body counts when (SPOILER ALERT!) a mutated Stoltz begins to exact his revenge upon his captors. Generally speaking, this film is disappointing in that it's nowhere as intelligent as the David Cronenberg original (well, his remake of the 1958 film). But in this film's favor, Stoltz is quite good in the lead, as is Daphne Zuniga, who are both better of actors than you usually get in most horror films. Also, the gory special effects are well done, which is a good thing if you enjoy that sort of thing, which I do. That was enough to make this sequel watchable, but it's nowhere as intelligent or as compelling as the Cronenberg original.",

After watching The Fly however, it really made this a very underwhelming sequel. Seeing as this wasn't directed and co-written by David Cronenberg and instead is by the make-up artist form the first film was not a good sign at all, but it does give into some new ideas that were perhaps restrained by David Cronenberg. When it goes through the first few minutes that the main girl from the first film goes into labor and finally got the baby out that's half fly and half human, it's a great idea to start with and you can do a lot of things with a character that's half fly/human. The thing is with it is that the filmmakers didn't do a lot with that and just have the character some generic powers. The characters are sticklike and aren't nearly as memorable as the characters in the first one. The villain is your average one that is nothing new. The dog scene was a bit unbearable to watch and consider that the director wanted this so that the viewers can feel sorry for the test subject, makes it even worse as they could've just put a human in, and it would have the same feeling as the dog, but more bearable to watch. The plot is mediocre which the director should've focused on, but it was more focused on the make-up and gore effects, and that was the problem here. The bigger problem however, was that the effects either look cartoony, rushed, or just really bad. The only good parts of the film, are the decent actingC and the cameo scene which is the most interesting and enjoyable part. The Fly 2 is a pointless sequel that could've worked given the ideas that they put in this, but were executed poorly.",

There is a truly mean spirited feel to the movies graphic gore, especially the dudes face being melted off, vicious bastard Frank (The Mist, The Green Mile) Darabont's fingerprints are all over it.

Eric Stoltz is good as Martin Brundle, the son of Seth Brundle and does well playing as a five year old who suffers from accelerated growth because of his \"Fly\" genes, though the character does miss it's quirkyness from the first film. It really is the last 30 minutes that saves the film and most acting is poor but the supporting cast but at least the lead as heart and is trying so hard over a weak, predictable script. But it does hook you and is a worthy sequel but you won't lose sleep over it, if you don't see it.

The characters are wafer thin, and the plot really doesn't hold water.\n\nNonetheless, the gory sequences are gleefully grizzly and, like the original, Walas must once again be commended for his creature effects that made the first film so spectacular.

The film started off well, but towards the middle, the film started to come apart and you could clearly see why the film was doomed to become an unnecessary sequel. After seeing this, you realize that David Cronenberg's remake of The Fly never needed a second part, but at the same time, it peaked my curiosity to see what sequel to that film would bring. Disappointingly, it just ended being a bad film with awful performances, decent, but ultimately cheap looking gore effect and poor directing. The cast do what they can =with such a poorly constructed script, and most of the cast just end botching their performances. This is a stupid sequel that should never have been made in the first place, and it will surely disappoint fans of the original. This is a film not worth your time and it fails to capture the chaotic horror of the original. The film had potential, and if Cronenberg would have made it, and wrote the script, this film would surely have been much better. However it is just really boring with an underdeveloped storyline and poor direction and lacking performances. The Fly II isn't worth seeing if you've seen Cronenberg's movie, and it should have been much better. Instead the film fails at being interesting for the viewer and it lacks anything truly worthwhile that would normally make it a good movie.",

The Fly II's first hour or so was just filler until Martin becomes the Fly, which then the movie pretty much was awesome!

In an unexpectedly touching scene, Martin euthanizes a canine that is mangled from the telepod experimentation. Darabont and company inject a lot of wily symbolism with a bug zapper and the flapping sound effects of a helicopter at the opening. When Martin metamorphoses into the fly, it's an insanely fun, grotesque creature-feature with mounds of gelatinous makeup (an acid-dissolving face) and poetic justice for the lead villain. Of course, 'The Fly II' is not the equal of Cronenberg's mesmerizing remake, but it is contagiously enjoyable, heart-breaking and unapologetic in its bloodletting.",

            "content": "If there is one thing I loathe almost more than remakes, it's a hollow and bland sequel film to a remake. \"The Fly II\" is, unfortunately, just such a beast.\r\n\r\nWe pick up where Cronenberg's creepy remake of this classic horror film left off, as we now follow the exploits of the son of Seth Brundle (played by Eric Stoltz). After his mother dies giving birth to him, he becomes the personal experiment of a greedy businessman (played by Lee Richardson), who is determined to use him to unlock the secrets of his father teleportation device. You know nothing good can come of that.\r\n\r\nRight off the bat, almost none of the characters from the original return to this outing, with the exception of John Getz, who reprises his role as the token jerk. Not a very good sign. Then, you have four screenwriters on the script, which doesn't give you much hope of a solid story. The old adage about \"too many cooks spoil the broth\" is in full effect here, as none of the characters ever really come to life (except, perhaps, a little bit from Richardson's).\r\n\r\nReally, I felt like the cast was sleepwalking through their scenes most of the time. There's no passion or spark in any of the performances. To be fair, to follow up on the incredibly frenetic and passionate energy of Jeff Goldblum's character from the first film, would be a very unenviable task for most actors, but Eric Stoltz never even gets close to anything like it. None of the cast do. Maybe they were as bored with the dialog here, as I was, I don't know. But there's really no standout performances here. There's almost no performances of any kind. They are all just cyphers to the need of the plot (such as it is). Just plodding along until the \"Brundle-Fly\" can come out and play. This is only made worse by the fact that there's no really likable characters in the entire film. Even Stoltz and Zuniga's characters, who are supposed to be the \"heroes,\" never evoked any kind of emotion from me, save apathy.\r\n\r\nDirector Chris Walas obviously wasn't interested in creating the eerie tension and drama that Cronenberg did in the first film, as he opts more for cornball performances and putting all his effort into the special effects. But even there the film is just lacking. You can tell he was trying hard to top the \"gross out\" appeal of the first film, but it never comes off that way. Much of the violence is pretty tame, especially compared to the first film. It comes off more like \"Cronenberg-lite\" and never really satisfies. Even the monster Martin becomes does more to invite laugher, rather than fear and revulsion.\r\n\r\nThis film is just a clear cut case of how one movie's success was used as just cause to create a pointless sequel. Everyone involved here could only have been looking to get a paycheck. It's b-grade horror at its most dull and boring. It's not even \"so bad it's good\" b-grade horror. There's no scares to be had here, nor any humor, save the possibility of the unintentional kind. If you've seen the first film, you certainly don't need to see this one. And if you haven't seen it, go watch that instead of this. The only thing this poor production has in common with flies, is the fact that any kind of crap will usually attract them.",

            "content": "Alright, so any sequel to a commerically successful horror movie with hidden human depths is going to be doomed to inferioty. It's a one trick pony, pulled off brilliantly by Cronenberg's original. What the Fly 2 does it accept essential the movie to be a scructual clone plotwise of the original movie, take the most successfl elements to set a credible begining half to the movie, and the second a condensed B-movie horror. And it works brilliantly. If I watched another movie struggle to emulate Cronenberg's vastly underatted, if critically popular, horror tradegy I'd lose interest. Only Cronenberg could of produced such an effecting drama with horrific overtones. Sure, it ain't the best horror sequel, or the best horror movie as a stand alone. But it features a very strong performance from Eric Stoltz as Brundlefly's offspring, very strong technical effects for the time from director Chris Wallas, the usual horror 80's faux pas with some brilliantly effective gore for a commercial horror movie and solid if simplistic story developments and direction . Of course, many looking for a sequel somewhere on par to The Fly may not be satisfied with this movie. It lifts \nkey points from the original story and continues it through Stoltz effecting performance, and revelling in more standard gore shocks than The Fly, Wallas directing debut makes a success out of the original's key plot elements in this picture without making a solid commitment to either. Neither tragic horror, neither fullblown generic creature feature movie. \nIn fact the only criticisms I have of the movie in a serious vein is that the insect/human hybrid itself never looks convincing, as in the first movie. While it certainly moves better technically, I never felt enough time was spent actually on the space bugs themselves to make them look convincing, although I do prefer this space bug due to a much more forboding size. But the design certainly doesn't spoil the picture for me. A B-movie in monster tone with some solid acting and strong execution for the time, The Fly 2 produces what is in effect a monster movie rather than tragic horror with more positives than negatives.",
