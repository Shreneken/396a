            "content": "A stupid movie that just begs the question of why was it made. Starts off with a man getting married and than finds out that a man that he sent to prison is coming for him. Instead of being smart and leaving town he decides to stay much to the reluctance of his new wife who is determined not to become a widow on he wedding day and will leave him if he stays. Why he would insist upon staying is beyond me, in my opinion he should have left town along time ago. No shard of character development here just a reason to make a movie about nothing in particular. Leave town already!! The only reason why I even give this a star is because the ending gun fight was pretty good, but way too late to save this mess of a movie.",
