The director Bernard Rose, who directed Candyman and Immortal Beloved, does wonders with a low budget and manages to be horrifically gory, but also poetic and dreamy.  Loved it.",

            "content": "Bernard Rose's Frankenstein is a relatively accurate modern rendition of Mary Shelley's classic novel, employing the director's sensitivity for today's social- and class-based issues in a similar manner to his most successful work, the original iteration of Candyman. \n\nShifting the perspective entirely to Xavier Samuel's 'monster', the plot focuses less on Frankenstein's own hubris and callous nature in creating a new life thoughtlessly than it does on the monster's naivete being eroded through several rather on-the-nose encounters out in the world, going from innocent, childlike idealist to callous indifference. Most of these events are pretty on-the-nose and aren't handled with what you might call the greatest subtlety, including an execution by cop right on the street. It's a movie that has its sensibilities in the right place and a solid central performance from Samuel, but the original novel remains cutting and universal enough that this remake probably wasn't a necessity. (2/5)",

            "content": "This 2015 horror film is free on YouTube and is not the campy James McAvoy/Daniel Radcliffe version that came out the same year. This was a modern-day version of the frequently filmed Mary Shelley novel set in contemporary L.A., with Danny Huston (son of John and half-brother of Anjelica) as Dr. Frankenstein, Carrie-Anne Moss (from \"The Matrix\" movies) as his wife and fellow scientist, and an Australian actor, Xavier Samuel, as \"Adam\" (the monster). \n\nSamuel's acting was incredible! Though low-budget, it was the best version of the story I've ever seen and was even believable. I highly recommend it. (Speaking of Danny Huston, he starred as the vampire leader in \"30 Days of Night,\" a fabulous horror film set in Alaska.)",

When he saves the drowning child the cops rush to arrest him, when he kills a cop he gets beaten by townsfolk but those events are so rushed and unprompted that it makes it seem like a student film. It also makes no sense that the monster has a British accent as he has no exposer to anyone from England during the duration of his life-and mainly learns to talk from tony Todd's character. The ending was rushed and nonsensical. Police get killed in this film with no true and realistic consequences. It's another garbage can throw away adaptation to a master piece of a novel. Don't see this film.",

I was hoping this would be a modern-day twist that maybe expanded on or further developed the story, but instead it cut everything good and added nothing of value.  There is so much wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start.  None of the characters were believable and they kept making assumptions that there's no way they would have otherwise, such as a cop finding a guy covered in blood and unable to speak and assuming he had the mental capacity of a child instead of that he was just high or mentally unstable which would have been the far more likely scenario, and the blind man assuming that Adam was hideous despite him not being able to see or verbally communicate with him other than a few words that Adam parroted back to him.  Throughout the movie Adam was narrating in perfect English so I assumed that he'd have mastered it by the end like he had in the novel, but he didn't so when on earth was he supposed to be narrating?  Also the whole \"mom\" thing made no sense linguistically.  The special effects were comically bad.",

            "content": "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is one of my very favorite novels. It's an amazing, brutal, and heartbreaking story. The movies have often turned this story into something different. A two-dimensional horror story about an evil, murderous monster that needs to be killed. That's completely backward. The story is about abandonment, cruelty, privilege, the things we don't know if we are not taught, and the human need for love. The need for a place where we can be accepted. A place to exist. \n\nI usually don't like modern retellings of these stories, because they get so much wrong. They usually lose so much of the spirit of the story in the process of trying to modernize it that the story fails to work as well as the original. This is an exception. This is, without question, one of the very best Frankenstein adaptations I've ever seen.",

Harrowing, graphic, and disturbing, this film will definitely upset some viewers. But the underlying messages and themes are timeless and heartbreaking. This movie felt less like a horror film and more like an extremely disturbing drama. There are some pacing problems but they are few and far between. Xavier Samuels gives an extremely powerful performance as \"Monster\" or \"Adam\". My major complaint was the naming of the movie.....the novel was aptly named for the Doctor who created the creature. But in this adaptation, Victor Frankenstein is a background character, and his wife is more of a centerpiece. However, the story is told from Adam's point of view, and the name of the movie seems to lose it's meaning in this context. And again; this is a very graphic movie. It is also very hard to watch because of the emotional weight of the events that occur. It is definitely worth it in the end.",
