            "content": "Kahaani is a thrilling ride from start to finish - when a pregnant Vidya Bagchi travels to Kolkata in search of her missing husband, the viewers are taken on an intense, emotional journey to solve the mysteries presented to Vidya throughout the film. This movie presents a huge contrast from many generic Bollywood tropes, providing a fresh take on Hindi cinema. However, some may believe that rejecting such tropes is a rejection of true Hindi cinema. Ashis Nandy writes about important characteristics of Bollywood movies, including overstatement, creating a spectacle, and focusing on events rather than character psychology. Kahaani strategically abandons these concepts, creating an subdued yet profound work of art that draws viewers in nonetheless. Guerilla filming allowed for the city of Kolkata to be captured in its most authentic light, sticking to an auspicious color scheme (red, white, and gold for the Durga puja) and showing the sights and sounds of the city's inhabitants. This was also a more psychologically oriented movie than your typical Bollywood experience - the excellent acting by Vidya Balan as well as her lesser known co-stars showed the inner lives of the characters and the motivations behind their actions, such as Rana's awe of and care for Vidya developing over time.\n\nKahaani is also unique in that in portrays a strong female lead. One of the first and most famous Bollywood movies to do so was Mother India, where a mother raises her children and farms seemingly infertile land when her husband abandons the family. Like Mother India, Vidya in Kahaani chooses to take matters into her own hands when the men around her don't help her. Many characters in the movie initially tried to convince Vidya that her husband had abandoned her and she should go back home, but she ignored them and persisted in pursuit of her goal. Additionally, both the mother in Mother India and Vidya in Kahaani end up defying all expectations placed on her by these males, eventually reaching their end goals solely through their own means. The images of the female lead in both films were tied into goddess Durga, who represents strength in Indian culture. Overall, this movie wove together intricate themes, storylines, and emotions to create a beautiful piece of film.",

            "content": "Set in a bustling Kolkata preparing for the Durga puja, Kahaani is an engrossing mystery/thriller which follows a pregnant Vidya Bagchi as she searches for her missing husband. Starring Vidya Balan as a powerful female lead, this film captures the audience's attention as it navigates the determination and fear circling Vidya's mind. As Vidya begins searching for her husband, she finds that most people are adamant that he does not exist. The evidence instead points to an individual named Milan Damji, with whom her husband shares an uncanny resemblance. With the help of Rana, a local police officer, Vidya continues her search and attracts the attention of the National Intelligence Bureau, who also seek to catch Milan and his inside man. The film takes many twists and turns as it reaches its conclusion, with the biggest shock coming at the end. Enjoyable aspects of the film include Balan's commanding presence in the lead role as well as her friendship with Rana, which is hard not to enjoy and provides some lighter moments. The deviation from a more formulaic film plot and the use of Kolkata as a vibrant and cultural background are also enjoyable. In terms of music, Amitabh Bachchan's version of Tagore's \"Ekla Cholo Re\" adds a touching and emotional dimension to a very raw moment in the film. Additionally, while some may criticize the emotional and teary ending, it provides rare insight into the psychology of a character.\n\nVidya Balan's portrayal of a strong and independent Vidya Bagchi in this female-centered film challenges many Bollywood portrayals of submissive female characters and works to further the comparison of Vidya to the goddess Durga, the destroyer of demons whose power is a representation of a mother's strength. This image of Vidya as Durga is hinted at throughout the entire film, but is only truly emphasized and made more obvious after she dons the red and white sari given to her by Rana. As Rachel Dwyer and Divia Patel explain, women depicted in traditional saris with their hair tied back (as Vidya's initially is) are associated with the high moralities of an ideal Indian woman (Dwyer and Patel, \"Female Character Types\"). Once this association is made clear, the connection of Vidya to a goddess who is a powerful destroyer, protector, and mother figure is more obvious. This mirrors Radha's emblematic character in Mother India, who is similarly shown as a fierce mother and protector, not only to her own children, but to the entire community. Radha is also depicted with goddess-like images and qualities, furthering the similarity of both women as protectors, who seek to avenge and defend.",

            "content": "Kahaani, directed by Sujoy Ghosh and starring Vidya Balan, Parambrata Chatterjee, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui, is a thriller set in Kolkata during the Durga Puja. It follows a pregnant woman, Vidya Bagchi, in her search for her missing husband, only to be told that he never came to Kolkata. She continues in her search, however, and uncovers a connection between her husband and a known terrorist, attracting the attention of both the terrorist organization and the national Intelligence Bureau. The film pulls you in with sympathy for a pregnant woman in an unfamiliar city and keeps you hooked as she acts with cleverness and ingenuity even as the danger closes in on her. Each character adds to your enjoyment of the story, from Vidya herself to Mr. Khan, a coarse Intelligence Bureau agent with a bad attitude and few morals. Vidya's strength throughout the movie is reminiscent of the strong female characters of older movies, such as Radha from Mother India, both of whom are mothers willing to put in the physical work needed to help their husband and children. \nThe film is an excellent example of a new form of Bollywood film, in which the audience must follow multiple characters, each with different but interconnecting stories, whose relationships are only truly understood by looking at the big picture (Gopal 341). This film takes it even farther, by keeping the audience in the dark about an explosive secret, which clarifies, even overturns, everything you thought you knew about the characters. Overall, Kahaani is a stellar film with a gripping story, well-developed characters, and colorful scenery. It is a successful use of a new type of Bollywood storytelling, and a good sign for the healthy future of Bollywood.\nGopal, Sangita. 2011. \"Second-Generation Multiplexes and the Multiplot Film.\" Conjugations: Marriage and Form in New Bollywood Cinema.

            "content": "Let's make one thing clear 1st, like most Bollywood sequels; this one too has no relation to its 2012 predecessor. Despite that it's hard not to consider this film as one of the anticipated films of the year, with director Sujoy Ghosh returning to helm the film as well as writing it, and of course acting power house Vidya Balan leading the film, along with a promise of yet another gripping thriller is something we all as an audience have been looking forward to. Although the film is a standalone sequel, for most parts, it can be considered a worthy successor, mainly due to its shared setting (West Bengal) and director Sujoy Ghosh's steely resolve to not let typical mainstream contrivances come in the way of stellar storytelling, which is both reassuring and commendable. What made the 1st film an absolute killer was that its entertaining, layered storytelling was followed by a disclosure through which we realized that nothing had been what it seemed through the film. While, this film too features many disturbing and mystifying individual elements and successfully delivers some shock treatment for viewers throughout the film. The expected suspense, unpredictability, and thriller elements are missing here. It certainly begins on a high note, initial few minutes keep you engaging, but then post interval the plot loosens up. Ultimately, post intermission, you realize that most things in the film were more or less what you thought they were when they first rolled by and the big reveal is just so-so. This isn't a story where one gets to predict or ponder, because for a large part of the film we know who the antagonists are, and what drives them. This thus stops one from experiencing the thrill of guessing and / or deducing, and instead makes us take sides and hope for an ending that justifies that action. Hence, even though it is predictable to an extent, it is also real and grounded at all times, largely due to some excellent production design by Subrata Barik and Kaushik Das. What is most admirable in the film is that director Sujoy Ghosh manages to keep the proceedings engaged with the help of Vidya Balan, who once again excels and proves her brilliance and spontaneity. The story follows Vidya Sinha (Vidya Balan), a doting single working parent of Mini (Tunisha Sharma), a paralyzed teenage girl confined to the wheel chair. Vidya is saving every penny possible so as to be able to take Mini to New York for her treatment as she is optimistic that Mini would be able to walk on her own after the treatment. But destiny has a different plan for her as Mini gets kidnapped and Vidya receives a call from the kidnappers to meet at an address. As she madly rushes to the said address, she meets with an accident and goes into coma. Charged as a hit and run, the case is assigned to Sub Inspector Inderjeet Singh (Arjun Rampal) who is surprised to see that Vidya, has an uncanny resemblance to a wanted criminal known as Durga Rani Singh, with whom Inder also shares a past. While investigating Inder comes across Vidya's diary which reveals where she has been all this years. What is the connection between Vidya and Durga Rani? How does Inder know Durga Rani? How is Vidya able to save her daughter? What was the motive of the kidnappers? This is the mystery. As expected, the narrative is absolutely rousing, nail biting and terrific in the first part. There isn't a second wasted in pulling the viewer into the drama. Director Sujoy Ghosh must be commended for his tight screenplay and for building up the thriller beautifully, and making sure the atmospherics throughout the film are pitch perfect, lending a note of authenticity to a screenplay that doesn't always make sense. The film also has a subtle touch on a social issue (child abuse) but does not preach about it and there lies the beauty. Vidya's lower middle-class existence, her torturous past, the dashing cop with a tenuous link to her - they all fit in perfectly with the tone, as the film moves swiftly from past to present, leaving no time for the audience to ponder the many inconsistencies in the narrative. Ignoring the convenient consequences of characters interrelated in this slice of 'scary' life tale; it is safe to say that the motives of each and every character, including the minor ones, are superbly drawn out.  Like its predecessor, here too the places - Chandannagar, Kalimpong, and Kolkata, end up having identities of their own and almost seem like protagonists in their own right, thanks to sound designer Anirban Sengupta and cinematographer Tapan Basu, who are superb when it comes to turning places cold, menacing, maddening, and authentic, all at the same time, and in succession. Also, Ghosh's eye is just as keen as it was four years ago, as there's a wealth of visual detail scattered across the film; one of my favorite throwaway moments is when Inderjit chases a fake-passport supplier through his workplace and we catch a split-second glimpse of art forgeries stacked in a room. Clinton Cerejo's background score is dauntless in its effectiveness and acts as a catalyst to the duo's efforts. It is the relentless journey that glues the various elements of the story by Sujoy Ghosh and Suresh Nair together. Because, even though we know that not everything is what it seems, we are also inwardly hoping for things to go the way we expect them to. Unfortunately, the film's biggest letdown is the final moments. The pre-climax and climax portions lack what it takes for the film to become a gem of a thriller and it seems like the director is rushing to a clich\u00e9d end. Also, the conflict drops flat towards the end of the second half and a lot of questions arise with the predictable, forced climax which lacks the bang. Ghosh, who seemed confident in his conceptualization till the final 20 minutes, is clearly aiming at a similar sock-the-viewer-in-the-neck impact as before, but comes up instead with an unimaginative, more or less predictable whimper. Maybe because, director Ghosh seems convinced that both his films constitute a franchise, and that he has to live up to the expectations of fans who'd be disappointed if the new film didn't have an assassin, two cops, and a moment of high drama that turned out to be visual deception. It's not that Ghosh doesn't have a fresh story to tell - some of the subplots in this film could sustain a whole feature by themselves. Still, by the time the (fairly shaky) denouement arrives, you can feel the narrative strain to top the earlier film's final reveal. Though this film has none of the memorable detailing of satellite characters that made the 1st film outstanding (like the awesome Bob Biswas) it is unobtrusively insightful in its own way. The long-term effects of sexual abuse, victim blaming, the politics in the police establishment and small-town life are all dealt with effectively. I really enjoyed the sweetness of the brief romance between Vidya/Durga and her beau Arun (Tota Roychoudhury), his kindness to her and his non-aggressive wooing. And there is a refreshing, believable normalcy in the relationship between Inderjeet and his wife Rashmi. While, the ending may not deliver the goods, but Viday Balan certainly does. The media has for years now discussed her willingness to take on the physical attributes of the various characters she plays. While that is no doubt a remarkable quality, to focus on that alone would be an injustice to this fine artist since physical quirks can be used as crutches by average actors too. Balan's strength is her ability to drown out her own personality for a role. Vidya certainly excels in the film; her deglamorised look suits the plot. Vidya Balan's characters keep you engaged wondering whether she is a victim or a perpetrator. Arjun Rampal is in top-form after a long time. He nails the part & enacts the cop, skillfully. He seems under control as far as his acting is concerned, thanks to a screenplay that ensures he is one of the most balanced characters of the film. The child actresses playing 'Minu', Naisha Khanna and Tunisha Sharma are adorable. In supporting roles, Jugal Hansraj, Tota Roy Chaudhury, Amba Sanyal, Manini Chadha and Kharaj Mukherjee are effective. On the whole, 'Kahaani 2' is worthy watch for its performances and screenplay despite a couple of major scripting flaws.",

She hasnt seen or spoken to him in some time and is worried for him and the future of their child. She gets help from the local police but nobody has heard or even seen him before.  I wont go into much detail of what happens but what i will say is what unfolds is an mystery with many twists and turns that becomes increasingly dangerous as the film progresses.

Looks like nerve gas.  Soon thereafter, there is a mass death on a train when a vial of the stuff is broken in one of the cars.  End segment.\n\n    Vidya travels from London, UK to Kolkata, West Bengal, IN to find her husband.  He talked to her everyday since he left London, up until about two weeks previous.\n\n    At the first the police have no idea.  The place where he worked claimed he worked says they made no assignments for him, and he did not report to them.  The police suggest a body; she does not recognise it.  She and the police go to where his uncle lived, but no one will say that they know of him.  They get the same sort of response at the school where he did his studies in youth.  The cops investigate the airline records; no one of his name left London nor arrived in Kolkata on the given dates.\n\n    Vidya reached out to Agnes, who does some digging, but finds locked files.  Oi.  She remembers a man with another name (Milan Damji) who looked just like Vidya's picture of her husband.  Soon thereafter, Agnes is murdered.  A police official (Khan) who is targeting the company NDC interviews her about her relationship to Agnes.  The experiments at the beginning of the film were done at NDC.\n\n    Khan and his boss reach out to outlier intelligence personnel to solve the crime of the rail attack.  The bad guys attempt to scare Vidya with a visit from the man who assassinated Agnes.  Vidya and Rana continue to investigate her husband's real movements before he disappeared.\n\n    Will Vidya find out the truth?  Is her husband still alive?  Will the miscreants be brought to justice?\n\n------Scores-------\n\n    Cinematography: 6/10 Lots of VHS level shooting, lots of amateurish footage.\n\n    Sound: 8/10 Mostly fine, but some of the incidental music is annoying to say the least.\n\n    Acting: 7/10 Reasonable.  The is mostly a one-woman show, but the one woman is not nearly stellar enough to carry a two hour movie.  The long-suffering Parambrata Chatterjee gave a good performance, which almost counterbalanced the rotten work of Nawazuddin Siddiqui.  Saswata Chatterjee as the assassin was not very believable either.\n\n    Screenplay: 0/10 Absurd.  The bad guys could have defused this at many junctures with relative ease.  A single knife thrust, for instance, and no one would be left who cared enough to keep the investigation going.  So, this is PC nonsense with an unconvincing lead.  The last five minutes were the worst in that regard.",

While the plot does go downhill by the third act Kahaani is still a refreshing experience from the usual male-central Bollywood flicks.\r\n\r\nKahaani is about a pregnant woman's searching for her missing husband which takes her from London to Kolkata, but everyone she questions denies having ever met her husband. The narrative structure of the film is very smart. One very good storytelling choice is introducing all the character within the first twenty minutes. Gradually building upon from first introduction. The mystery element of the film is well played. We only get a small glimpse of the overall mystery, but eventually grows into something bigger. The progression of the mystery feels natural with every new clue clearing up a part of the puzzle. The first two act are solid adding more to the mystery and characters past, but the last act is where the plot begins to crumble and show it cracks. It immediately stop building up the mystery behind our heroine missing husband and a twist ending that turns the film into an undercooked spy thriller. The twist never receives any buildup throughout the entire film making it reveal completely artificial and convoluted. \r\n\r\nVidya Balan is outstanding in the leading role. Her ability to tailor her emotions of sympathy, anger and despair - multiplies the strength of her character and the film. At time coming of vulnerable and other frustrated over a missing clue making you worried about her safe being. Parambrata Chattopadhyay is subtle and splendid as Rana. Acting alongside with Balan in many scenes with great and convincing chemistry. Aside from the top notch acting it's succeed from a technical standpoint. Director Sujoy Ghosh makes the city of Kolkata a character of the film with it cinematography. He perfectly captures the essence of city - the culture, durga-puja, dirty alleys and even the strained lifestyle. There are no ultra-clean streets with pretty models running about; no unbelievably dramatic situations; no interrupting songs. This accompanied with the score which plays innocently as the characters travel the length and breadth of the city enchanting the mood of what we're seeing. Elegantly shifting mood with every new music piece we listen.\r\n\r\nKahaani twist ending might diminish part of the viewing experience for some, but the complete package still satisfies. Filled with fine performances and a mystery that will have you hooked until the very end more than make up for any shortcomings that occur in the last act.",

            "content": "Sujoy Ghosh's superb thriller boasts a committed, star turn from Vidya Balan, but what really makes it work beyond the boundaries of its genre and cultural origins is tight pacing, strong direction and powerful storytelling.  Kahaani certainly is Balan's show, from the time we first see her making her way out of a crowded Calcutta airport, clutching her passport, wheeling her baggage and being harried by taxi drivers to her determined quest and its shocking conclusion.  She exhibits a winning mix of charm, determination and grit - all the while being heavily pregnant.  She plays Vidya Bagchi, who has risked all to come from London to find her husband Arnab, whom she says has gone missing in the city of six million people.   She starts off by checking into the fleabag Guest House where her husband was staying and proceeds to try and trace his whereabouts.  She is helped by a smitten policeman Rana (an unassumingly charming Parambrata Chatterjee) and brash IB agent Khan (a terrific Nawazuddin Siddiqui, whose roughhouse screen charisma should have Hollywood calling very soon).   Writer-Director Ghosh keeps the action moving briskly, refusing to be distracted by hometown filmic sensibilities, but instead taking pages out of the Hollywood thriller handbook.  He also uses his film to beautifully showcase the city of Calcutta in all its idiosyncrasies, his deft use of location adding a strong sense of place in taking this gritty thriller forward.  Ultimately its denouement is far-fetched (much like any thriller) and there are a few loopholes, but the film's believability is never in doubt, with Ghosh's strong script deftly keeping the story from lapsing into contrivance, overkill or hyperbole.  Great acting, powerful pacing and tight craftsmanship make this film that rare beast: a Bollywood thriller made for those who don't watch Bollywood thrillers.",

And I think that's the best type of twist, the type that completely changes how you viewed everything that already happened.  I think it's a tad convoluted, but it was a good  twist.  And the other reason I liked the film was Vidya Balan.  She has a confidence about her that is a welcome sight and she does a great job in this film.  The problem with this film is that the story, or better yet the story progression, is lacking.  The movie progresses like this 'find a lead, follow up on that lead, get a clue that leads to another lead' rinse and repeat.  And I hate films that progress like that, it's just not good.  The film tries to tie it to Vidya trying to find her husband and never giving up, so they do try to make it a personal affair for the main character, but I simply don't like this story progression.  I suppose every film like this progresses like that, but it's far more noticeable in this film.  Still, it's still a good film from top to bottom.  There was never any point in the film that I thought that it was bad, so it's never bad at any point fortunately.  That's about it really, this is a solid thriller.  Flawed, but solid.",

I will tip my hat to this movie in that I don't think I have ever seen a pregnant woman on a mission movie before, so that's definitely something new.  I did think Vidya Balan did a good job as the strong willed protagonist, and it is filmed well enough to appreciate it.  The problem I have with it is that while I was always engaged by it, I always knew where it was going (up until the ending, that is, which is impossible to see coming).  In addition to that, I also felt that it got a bit repetitive, hitting the same notes multiple times as she runs into dead end after dead end.

Other few small characters also catch the eye - an adorable little kid who lives near Vidya's guest house and becomes a very good friend, to the sinister contract killer who greets his victims with a warm smile before drilling few bullets into them.\n\nThe backdrop of hustling-bustling Kolkata, 'The City of Joy', set in the time of their biggest festival, Durga Puja, certainly plays an important role in telling the story.

With sumptuous twists and thrills thrown at anticipating intervals, the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat and treats you with an overwhelmingly startling climax.  Sujoy ghosh after a trail of not so gratifying feats does a clean sweep with Kahaani. The ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances and renders the much needed factual elements to craft this tour de force. Vidya's character has been skilfully sketched with many layers. For instance her playful inquisitiveness with the teashop boy, light exchanges with the lodge in charge to the final fury with Damji; all of them clearly classified yet bonded with so much of feminine veracity.  Setu's camera coherently captures the beauty of Calcutta in its raw form and Namrata's dexterous editing adds the needed glitter. Gosh this time has quite brilliantly kept the characters well chiselled and ensured the viewers to be given almost no room in guessing the continuance of the plot. Music is influential and ensures to cater the narrative with the needed pitch. Ghosh eloquently brings every frame to life with a generous effort on the screenplay and progressiveness. Altogether this Kahaani is indeed a celebration of the compelling audacity of womanhood.",

            "content": "I come from India and I have missed out a lot of good Indian Cinema. Indian films are known for their style of using spicy music and actors acting in a hyper way. That's why I usually reside in foreign films and hate these kind of films (some of them are nice though, just a few ;)). But there are some really great Bollywood films that have come out in recent times that break all these common rules and have grossed more than these cliched films. Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani is one of them. In the film, a pregnant women (Vidya) comes from UK to the city of Kolkata, India, in search of her missing husband. She hadn't heard from him for a long time and the most surprising thing is that everyone denies of seeing him. She visits all the places where her husband has been (as he told her on the phone). There was just no record of her husband, not even his flight records. Vidya, with a local inspector Satyaki Sinha (played brilliantly by Parambrata Chatterjee), go deep into the mystery in search of a her husband. As the film advances, the mystery deepens and leads to a final epic conclusion.\n\nI know what you are thinking... This story is just like Lady Vanishes, right? This is where you are wrong. Firstly the screenplay is ingenious, something that probably even challenges some of the greatest Hollywood films. The final result is realistic, truly something you don't get to see in Indian cinema. Secondly, the acting is miraculous. Vidya Balan, who plays the pregnant women, gave me an impression of a woman really being pregnant. It's not so easy to act a pregnant woman as you have to walk in a different fashion and Vidya Balan stays that way the entire film. Vidya Balan is such a versatile actress that she has made to Times Magazine's 100 most influential people. Her Femininity is one of the powerful elements of this film. The Inspector, played by Parambrata Chatterjee, is a new actor but he surprised me. The whole ensemble was great, they deserve a standing ovation for their performances. Thirdly, the beautiful direction. The film is richly detailed, something that even the greatest of Western cinema lacks. I can't go into these details but believe me I am not praising this film just because I am Indian. Lastly, the film's ending is quite thought-provoking. The film highlights terrorism and detests it. But I won't give you any more details, it might spoil the fun :D!\n\nIn conclusion, Kahaani is rich in story-telling, acting, directing, details, screenplay. It's culturally rich too (something that most Indian films lack, probably all!). If you are an Indian, go watch this now. If you are from some different country, I assure you you won't be sorry... In my personal opinion Kahaani is by far the one of the best Commercial films that Bollywood has ever produced. And for it's creativity, courage and breaking common Bollywood rules, I bow down to the entire team of Kahaani. We really need films like Kahaani to develop a good taste of cinema in Indian audiences and the good news is because of Kahaani, no ones likes to watch those kind of cliched Bollywood flicks anymore!...\n\nVisit my facebook movie page: www.facebook.com/filmsthemostbeautifulart",

            "content": "\"Kahaani\" - An Edge of the Seat \"Story\"\r\n\r\n\"Kahaani\", another power house performance by Vidya Balan, the story is of Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan), a software engineer from London who comes to Kolkata in search of her husband Arnab Bagchi (Indraneil Sengupta) who goes missing in Kolkata. The story revolves around how Vidya unfolds the mystery of her missing husband.\r\n\r\nThe main highlight of the movie is the tout story and screenplay by Sujoy Ghosh & Advaita Kala which keeps the audiences glued to their seat till the end. Each character is well defined and fits into the puzzle called \"Kahaani\", truly a story well told.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight of the movie is the crisp editing by Namrata Rao which does not let the movie lose its pace even for a minute. Setu's camerawork captures the true spirit of Kolkata and adds up to the drama of the story.\r\n\r\nNow let me mention the captain of the ship, the director Sujoy Ghosh, who makes a comeback with this movie, and what a comeback. \"Kahaani\" will be go down history as one of the best thrillers of Bollywood. Sujoy is in complete control and it shows in the way he has handled such a complex story with so many layers.\r\n\r\nNow the biggest highlight the cast. Vidya Balan once again proves her brilliance in her portrayal of Vidya Venkatesan Bagchi, from the body language of a pregnant woman to her expressions Vidya Balan has done complete justice to the character. Another actor Parambrata Chattopadhyay who plays the role of the Police Inspector Satyaki Ghosh alias \"Rana\" is brilliant and so is Nawazuddin Siddiqui who plays the CBI Inspector Khan. Another Bengali actor who makes an impact is Saswata Chatterjee who plays \"Bob\" a LIC agent; whenever he comes on the screen it gives the audience the chill. The support casts like Dhritiman Chatterjee, Indraneil Sengupta also do a good job.\r\n\r\nThe music by Vishal-Shekhar is as per the mood of the movie. Especially \"Piya tu Kahe\" a hard rock with a fusion of Indian Classical and Amitabh's rendition of Rabindranath Tagore's \"Akla Cholo Re\" are the highlights.\r\n\r\nOverall an entertaining thriller which has an impact which lingers long after the movie is over. A must watch and please note \"DO NOT MISS THE BEGINNING\", I give 5 stars, one additional star for capturing Kolkata so beautifully.",

She has constantly amazed me with her magnetic screen presence in Ishqiya, Parineeta and The Dirty Picture, reminding of Smita Patil (with almost the same smoulder). The only other actress that comes close is Mahie Gill (with shades again of the SP smoulder). In this delectable thriller where Kolkatta plays an important and visually splendid protagonist Vidya takes us on a journey of deceit, crime, espionage and faint crushes. Sujoy Ghosh the director who paid homage to Pancham da in the delightful 'Jhankaar Beats' only to let us down terribly with 'Home Delivery' and 'Aladin' is fine fettle with an ensemble cast ably supporting Vidya. It is extremely cerebral in most parts though it tends to get a little formulaic at times, but you tend to forgive Sujoy because of what the film delivers in its entirety. Not many filmakers have been able to make the landscape as important a character as Sujoy does with Kolkatta and just watching Vidya emote through the many nuances of the taut screenplay, makes your day!",

Of course, there are moments when we get that natural performance. If only, it were easily natural to her!!! The movie is as good as her acting. Few have compared it to Lucky Number Slevin (can't quite recall it, but am sure that the premises weren't the same) for its treatment. Maybe. I can't confirm how much it's influenced from Ruby Cairo either since I haven't seen the latter as yet. Nor am I least keen to. Kahaani in itself is enough.

Make no mistake, Kahaani is a good film and deserved to be applauded for how unconventional it is. However, as a thriller, it doesn't rank alongside great or even very good films of the genre. There is more than one plot twist, and the main one is something I saw coming halfway into the film, simply because the director isn't very good at covering up his tracks. Occasionally a character will say something that the scene doesn't require at all, and you know instantly that it is a clue that we will return to later. Other flaws include far too many peripheral characters (although superbly acted) and unnecessary double and triple plot twists. That being said, the movie makes a bold choice with the use of a pregnant woman as the protagonist, is engaging throughout and not lazy with details. Sujay Ghosh makes excellent use of Kolkata as a setting, and the city is almost another character. Although the story is an extremely far-fetched one, it is never boring and quite gripping throughout.",

            "content": "The Kahaani review: Bidya and Kolkata concoct a stupendous tale in Kahaani \r\n\r\nMidway through the Woody Allen masterpiece, Midnight In Paris,I wondered if anybody from our very own bollywood had the finesse to re-create the magical aura that came to surround the city of Paris in the movie .Which of the current crop of Indian directors had the talent to showcase an Indian city with such resplendence and make the city a character in the plot itself,I said to myself. 5 minutes into the Sujoy Ghosh's brand new movie,Kahaani,I got my answer.I can't remember a Bollywood movie in recent times in which the city was so close to being termed a character in itself. The city Kolkata is brimming and bustling with activity during the Durga Puja period and Sujoy Ghosh does a wonderful job to capture all the colors of the city on the celluloid. Coupled with one of the best performances by an actor in recent times(Im getting tired writing the \"best performances\" line for each nd every Vidya Balan movie) Kahaani tells the tale of a woman in an alien city in search of her husband and is one of the best flicks in the thriller genre to be churned out by Bollywood ever. \r\n\r\nFrankly speaking, the connection between Allen's movie and Khaani ends, as we are introduced to Vidya Bagchi, an IT professional residing in London who comes to visit the city. After a disturbing first scene in which a gruesome bio-terrorsist attack is shown and the viewers are left to wonder wats its connection with the plot; a heavily pregnant Ms Bagchi embarks on one-(wo)man mission to search for her husband who has been missing since his visit to the Bengal capital. Playing a pregnant lady searching for her husband in the ragged streets of a metropolis where every you can't differentiate between friend and foe was never going to be a walk in the park, but with every minute of her on screen presence you can't help but wonder this is an actress with some special talent and boy does she excel in her unique role. She's assisted in her treacherous ordeal by one sympathetic Inspector Rana(Bengali actor Parambrata Chattopadhyay). What follows is a breath taking and edge of the seat journey to discover the whereabouts of Arnab Bagchi, Vidya's husband,through dingy lanes and small villages that form the heart of Kolkata amongst others. All this in the mesmerizing backdrop of the Durga Pooja festivities and you have one hell of a hankering to go and visit the city yourself at the end of the movie. Vidya is a picture of moxie filled with varied emotions as she comes to terms with her pregnancy which will mark the arrival of a new human being in her life as opposed to the shock of a departure of an important part of her life as her husband goes missing. With all its beauty and goodness (most notably in the form of Rana and the kid at her motel where vidya stays) the city is also shown to have a much darker side to it with the most curious of contract killers you will ever see, on Vidya's trail. Bob Biswas,the contract killer even with his limited time on the screen manages to create a huge impression. To complicate matters the Intelligence Bureau also gets involved as it emerges that Arnab Bagchi's face matches with a dreaded terrorist,Milind Damji who infact is a trained IB agent who has defected to the enemy's side. Coherent synchronization of myriad characters and plot and subplots had to be an arduous task but the wonderfully talented Sujoy Ghosh weaves the plot ever so intricately and meticulously. The flawless execution of the same is reminiscent of the work of another great Bengali director,Satyajit Ray. In a way the film with its slick screenplay and editing and its ability in managing to hold the viewers till the end,has definitely set the benchmark(a high one at that) as far as the thriller genre is considered and has only taken the industry forward in terms of quality of film-making. Kudos to the team for that!!! \r\n\r\nWell now, coming to the important part regarding the performances. Leading the pack and ruling the roost is the leading \"actor\" of the story,Vidya Balan. After sweeping away almost all awards at award functions for 2011 with her sublime portrayal of Silk smitha in the Dirty Picture, movie buffs were salivating with the expectation of another stupendous performance from Balan after the promising promos. And she delivers big time. Every single emotion, from the gritty pregnant lady to the wife hankering for her husband is presented flawlessly by her. Her role of Silk Smith gave the word \"bold\" a new height and meaning and with her turn as Bidya Bagchi,as she's often called in the film,Balan takes the word to dizzying heights albeit in a different direction. So, silk smitha transcends into Vidya bagchi almost with terrifying non-chalance. With her meticulous selection of roles Vidya has broken free of the usual run-of the mill roles that actresses usually portray in the industry and is by far the most talented actress of her generation, and I dare say rubbing shoulders with the likes of Smita Patil, such are her supreme acting skills. The supporting cast comprising mainly of some wonderfully talented Bengali actors are the icing on the cake with their stellar performances . Saswata Chatterjee, as Bob Biswas the contract killer cum LIC agent is a revelation, but you wish that he had more of screen time. I so wish someone would create a spin-off movie on his character. The rest of the cast including Rana and Khan,the IB officer, also give solid support to Vidya in taking the movie forward. Sujoy Ghosh with an extremely well written script and slickly directed flick delivers one of the best movies of recent times. The promise post the success of Jhankar Beats which went missing and hit rock bottom with Aladdin is now back and back with a bang,as a matter of fact he has outdone himself here. The way in which, every single part of the complex plot and every little detail has been coherently stitched together leading upto the gripping finale is really worth appreciating and commendable on his part. The background music and soundtrack by Vishal-Shekhar take the film forward and keep the adrenaline flowing in sync with the mood and pace of the movie. \r\n\r\nIn the end as you walk out of the theater having watched one of the most compelling and complete Bollywood flicks in recent times you can't help but wonder that movie was an experience in itself and a satisfying one at that. This is top drawer stuff we are talking about, a coming of age flick, one that is complimented by sublime performances not only by the leading lady but the entire cast and flawless execution of a solid script. Critics, who have dismissed Bollywood as one stagnant cesspool, watch out, there is still a ray of hope and air of freshness that this industry can offer. Please step forward monsieur Sujoy Ghosh and Ms Vidya Balan. Clap,clap!!",

By strong it doesn't becomes all 'Avant-garde' and it doesn't needs any gimmicks or any camera (and other) tricks to please the audiences -  and has a clear-bold screenplay. You feel the good - quality of the film while watching it and may also feel the necessity that such a strong written story would have been more strong visually if something unique would have been convened from the director's hat. Though it is not and though the film's cinematography is kept simple and solemn, still the film makes you want to see it because it is a new theme for Bollywood masses - a pregnant Indian woman (who hasn't been in India for a time) arrives to the city of Kolkata and from airport she goes straight to the police-station for finding his missing husband. Being Linear throughout it still has a big surprise in its conclusion (resembling the last minute twists from recent Bollywood movies like A Wednesday, Bodyguard and Don 2 have been successful in using). Now I think with the developing country - its film industry is also changing, which is why instead of any Khans, Kapoors or Kumars.It is Vidya Balan who emerges as a sole protagonist of the film. If she continues to select and sign her films this way (unlike Akshay Kumar - who went blind after his success) then it is soon she be called 'The'  Vidya Balan.  As the 'Heros' of old Bollywood films need a female co-star in their films to make it look fresh, this time Vidya Balan is provided the support of a male co-star but still taking the glory herself (like our Heroes take in their films - and Heroines come just for giggling and dancing). Another amusing and deadly appearance comes is given Of course by Sashwata Chatarjee who's 'Bob Biswas' character (and insurance agent during the day and a henchman at night) has gained fame among masses. Even his lines 'Namaskar....Ek Minute....' \nare famous in general tongues. Dritiman Chaterjee has two or three scene in which he looks almost real like a corrupt senior official (which he also looked like a corrupt businessman in Agent Vinod) and Parambrata Chaterjee who is for Vidya's support in the film simply does the job - nor too best and neither too dull. The only time you have that odd feeling is when Darshan Jariwala (who looks too ficitonal and predictable) and Nawazuddin Siddiqui are shown. But that slight oddness doesn't hinders the film from griping the audiences eyes, mind and heart. A more nurturing with a research on its other elements (apart from its screenplay) and I bet this film would have the international (more then it has now) touches from the movie industry.",

The main hero is Kolkatta as you dont see unless you go there. Raw and captivating. Vidya Balan leads the movie without a doubt along with very subtle yet well executed role by Parambrata Chatterjee. Loved the twists,turns,background scores and the list goes. People might debate on the ending of the movie but it is flawless to think about to that extend.

I wasn't much interested when it was released, but then some people said its damn good and is very twisted in the end, so gradually this movie got me excited and THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST INDIA HAS EVER HAD. It has a fantastic and a gripping story. You'll be craving for more ahead as everything unfolds. The soul of the movie is its screenplay and story..and even the performances were marvelous. Vidya once again proves she is the most versatile and natural actress we have in India. Without any doubt, she is the best in the business we have in Bollywood. The supporting actor, the cop who helps the lead character of the movie i.e. Vidya Balan, was fantastic as well. The one who played Inspector Khan, well we have seen him in many movies, he does good in every movie and this is his best performance and best role as well, although it would've been great if someone with much more dashing personality would've played it. The character of the Insurance Agent in the movie (well yeah not JUST an insurance agent) was classic. It was mysterious, funny and terrifying altogether. Only if we had more of it, but still, it was perfect with the story of the movie. The cinematography is beautiful, makes you feel like you are in Kolkata. The music by Vishal Shekhar is fine, the fast version of Ekla Cholo Re was the best and background score by Clinton was actually good. No wonder, this guy worked with A.R. Rehman, Salim Sulaiman, Vishal Bharadwaj and other India music maestros. And the direction is flawless, gripping and perfect. Its a bit hard to believe after this director did two DISASTROUS movies like Home Delivery and Aladin. Home Delivery was PATHETIC, was a different kind of a movie but it was senseless all the way. It would have been believable if he did Kahaani after Jhankaar Beats. Jhankaar Beats was a an amazing movie. A light, musical movie with a hint of adult humor and great music. I just hope this aint a copied flick. If its not, its a perfect thriller. A movie with great performances, superb story and unexpected jaw dropping twists. One of the best Bollywood movie ever made. Loved it. \n\n\nMy Rating: 8.5/10",

The entire film makes you feel on the track of  third man and finally pulls the carpet underneath your feet. full marks to the director to think of this concept. excellently placed in Kolkata.

This is one of the best thrillers to come out of Bollywood in recent times. The narration is really tight most of the times. Brilliant acting by all people in the film. About Vidya, all I can say is if she wins the National Award for this year too, it'll be a deserving win. The director has made Kolkota almost a character in the film. He beautifully captures the myriad expressions of the City of Joy. Bonus points for portraying the Intelligence Bureau officers in a rationally realistic way. Btw, we might have seen some plot elements in certain Angelina Jolie films before, but never mind. Who makes entirely original stuff these days ;)",

And this one's a multi-layered mystery to boot!\nThe fact that its not just based (and brilliantly shot) in good-ol' Kolkata, but also soaked completely in the city's earthy charm, provides an enigmatic dimension to the movie. A more familiar cityscape, like that of Mumbai, would've devoid this 'kahaani' of that differentiating vibe.\nVidya Balan is the only 'star' in the cast, and she delivers a smashing performance. But the movie wouldn't have worked quite as well without stellar character portrayals by each of the supporting actors.\nFinally...as the credits roll, the rendition of the classic 'Ekla Chalo Re' by Amitji makes the audience stay back in the theatre. I've read some blogs nitpicking on his imperfect pronunciation of the language. However, IMHO nobody else - including the current crop of Bengali mainstream singers in B-town - would have been able to bring the same kind of simplistic yet resounding depth to the revered anthem. Therefore, just like the central protagonist deals with the accentuated pronunciation of her name in the film...let us take it in our stride and enjoy this truly awesome movie!!",

            "content": "It\u00e2(TM)s difficult to not let my love for contemporary Bengali cinema colour this review for Kahaani. No harm done either way if you ask me, for this is essentially a \u00e2~Bengali\u00e2(TM) film on many counts. In fact, with so many familiar Tollywood faces in the ensemble, the Hindi dialogues almost seem out of place - especially in case of conversations between Parambrata and Kharaj (the other, chubbier inspector for the uninitiated). I am not sure if a Bengali version of the movie has been shot, but I am sure I will like it just a tad better in the least.  \nThe trailers promised a racy crime thriller and that\u00e2(TM)s exactly what Kahaani turns out to be. The search for the ever elusive \u00e2~Arnab Bagchi\u00e2(TM) takes on twists and turns and features the length and breadth of the \u00e2~City of Joy\u00e2(TM) like no other movie I can recall. To the regular movie goer, the start of the story roughly foretells what\u00e2(TM)s to come. It makes you instantly infer that clever goons, psychotic killers, heart-in-mouth chase sequences, flying bullets and a crazy twist at the climax are to follow. That\u00e2(TM)s not a bad thing as long as the other elements of movie making are done due justice to. And on most counts, Sujoy Ghosh and his crew were bang on target.\nWhat excited me in the trailers of the movie was the romanticizing of Kolkata. I was keenly anticipating the Kolkata elements in the storytelling and I didn\u00e2(TM)t have to wait long for it. For me, Kahaani does more justice to the romance of the contemporary city than what Dhobi Ghat could do for Mumbai or Delhi 6 attempted to do for the capital. From the dingy lanes of the northern part of the city to the posh restaurants of Park Street, from the ostentatious Durga Puja celebrations to the grim realities of city\u00e2(TM)s administrative facilities, the storyline delightfully weaves into it a most nonpartisan reflection of modern day Kolkata. The Kolkata Metro gets featured prominently- a first for me. The host of quality Bengali actors only add more magic. The camera work is delightful and so is the background score. \nKahaani is an out and out Vidya (not Bidya; a joke not repeated ad nauseam thankfully!) Balan movie. She is one of the very few female actors in Hindi cinema capable of carrying an entire film on her shoulders and follows up her stellar performance in \u00e2The Dirty Picture\u00e2? with a thoroughly professional effort in this movie. In some instances, I did feel her character was too high on life for a pregnant lady looking for her missing husband, but I am nit-picking. She looks strikingly gorgeous, and has a noticeable Bengali air about her throughout. Parambrata sketches the role of the unassuming side-kick to perfection once again. From \u00e2Bong Connection\u00e2? to \u00e2Baishe Srabon\u00e2?  and the numerous Feluda movies in between, he has definitely come of age as an actor and can now be easily rated as one of Bengal\u00e2(TM)s finest. Kharaj is charming in his police inspector role. Bob Biswas (played by Saswata) is an indolent insurance agent by the day and a cold-blooded contract killer by the night. The seasoned actor delivers a stirring performance and his was by far my favourite character in the movie. Nawazuddin (who plays the role of Khan from the Intelligence Bureau) essays his pissed-off foul-mouth inspector role with \u00c3 (C)lan. Even the bits and pieces characters are all executed to perfection and in fact, there is little to be complained about as far as the acting performances are concerned. \nThe script, in all honesty, does not have much to write home about. While it appreciably resists from meandering into romances and unnecessary side tracks, the screenplay does get a little befuddling at times. It can be forgiven I guess in such a fast paced mystery where the performances are good as they were in this case. The Kolkata charm is infectious, at least to this Kolkata born writer. I liked the scene where Vidya inadvertently gets touchy feely with Parambrata- nice and raw. The overtly friendly relationship between Vidya and the kids (at the hotel, chai stall) and the all-conquering hacker persona were a bit overdone but I guess that much creative trespassing can be slighted. It is after all, a mass market movie. Kudos to Sujoy for no dance sequences, not even a Durga Puja one. How I wish we completely grow out of this ridiculous fad soon. The \u00e2ekla cholo re\u00e2? effort by Amitabh Bachchan is cute but out of tune. \nAll in all, Kahaani is an engaging story brilliantly told by wonderful acting performances. For a Kolkatan, it also provides the \u00e2Hey, look! Kalighat Metro Station\u00e2? and \u00e2Eta New Market er kache\u00e2? moments to exclaim in the movie hall. I would still love to see a completely Bengali version though because I am certain I would like it even more. Aami shotti bolchi!",

But there is nothing worth criticizing in this brilliant movie. The cast, the intricacy of the plot, the fantastic screenplay and mindblowing characterization make it the best Hindi movie to come out so far this year and definitely will go a long way. The suspense  is dense and keeps you on the seat edge. The portrayal of Kolkata clubbed with fantastic camerawork and retro-metro colors make it a feast for the eyes. And Vishal Shekhar have given some kickass bgm. 4.5/5!!!!",

            "content": "Kahaani Review: Scintillating Blockbuster, Must Watch\n\nhere are a few movies which will keep you glued to the screen. You will be sitting on the edge of the seat and your mind will be making a million possible permutations to deduce what will happen next. Very few of them come from Bollywood. If ever there was a blockbuster movie from Bollywood, Kahaani is better than that. Read on to know why Kahaani is a must watch.\n\nPlot: It\u00e2(TM)s a crowded metro. Hundreds of travellers are waiting to reach their destination. They are killed with a chemical weapon. Two years later, Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) is a pregnant woman comes to India in search of her husband, Arnab Bagchi (Indraneel Sengupta) who has been missing. She can\u00e2(TM)t find a trace of him and is determined to solve the puzzle. In the search for Arnab, Vidya stumbles on Milan Damji who is a lookalike of her husband and is a prime accused in the metro attack.\n\n\n\nAll the clues to the case are being eliminated one by one. The Intelligence Bureau is involved and the hunt is on. Vidya is being helped by a local police officer Rana alias Satyaki (Parambrata Chattopadhyay). They are warned by the Intelligence Bureau to stay away but how long can they continue their search? Why was Arnab missing? What is his identity? Will he ever be found? These are, but a few questions that the story will answer you. Be ready to be taken on a roller-coaster ride.\n\nAnalysis: The movie is a drama-thriller. This genre requires exquisite attention to detail and a very well written script. A small blunder can make or break your movie. Kahaani has it all. With a brilliant story (Sujoy Ghosh and Advaita Kala) and a screenplay that runs along at a pace that will make you glued to the screen, the director has paid attention to every possible detail to ensure nothing is left in a hush.\n\n\n\nComing to performances by the cast, Parambrata Chattopadhyay as Rana is subtle and delivers a splendid performance. He is a well-known figure in Bengali cinema and his entry to Bollywood could not have been better. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, as the IB Deputy Director, is just picture perfect. It is tough to imagine that he is the same character who played the pickpocket in Munnabhai MBBS. In a role as a ruthless cop, he does ample justice to the role and delivers a power packed performance.\n\nRest of the cast; Saswata Chatterjee as a hit man, Darshan Jariwala as the former IB agent, Indraneel Sengupta as the rouge agent Milan Damji and as Arnab Bagchi, and every other member of the cast have delivered wonderful performances and not one of them looked out of place.\n\n\n\nFinally coming to Vidya Balan, what do I say about her? With Five brilliant performances in a row, she is unstoppable. She manages to reinvent and elevate herself with every performance and in Kahaani she just does that all over again. If The Dirty Picture won her rave comments from even the harshest of critics, Kahaani has just pushed the barrier a few notches higher.\n\nShe not only carries out the role with complete perfection, she looks every bit of the character that is written for her. She has conveniently steered way ahead of her competitors to stake the claim as the best actress in India. The review is stretching out too long or else I could have written an entire essay on how brilliant her performance was.\n\n\n\nThe director Sujoy Gosh has just opened the gates to endless praise. He has handled the subject in a manner that would shut even the harshest of critics. The element of suspense is kept throughout the movie and not once does the script turn out predictable. Crisp dialogues, backed by wonderful performance just makes it all the more better.\n\nThe camera work by Setu is apt; Screenplay by Sujoy Ghosh, Suresh Nair and Nikhil Vyas is just perfectly paced, Editing by Namrata Rao is crisp, and costumes by Sabyasachi Mukherjee (for Vidya Balan) and Suchismita Dasgupta just blend into the story perfectly. Music by Vishal Shekar is subtle and the rendition of Ekla Chalo Re by Amitabh Bachchan is just fantastic. In the end, the movie is a case of all the right things at the right place in the right hands.\n\nStudentLive\u00e2(TM)s Verdict: I will just keep this short, Kahaani is a must watch. If Paan Singh Tomar started a different trend in Bollywood, Kahaani just takes it further. Don\u00e2(TM)t even think of giving this one a miss. I will go with 4.5 out of 5 for Sujoy Gosh\u00e2(TM)s Kahaani. It is a wonderful gift to cinema on Women\u00e2(TM)s day and Holi.\n\nP.S: Pardon me for the slightly lengthy review, Kahaani deserves every bit of praise.\n\nSource: www.studentlive.in",

Stellar performances from everyone, from the life insurance sales guy cum assassin to the hot running water kid to the hard-nosed IB agent to Bidya madam, along with some kick-ass twists , all add up to an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Sujoy Ghosh makes a promising come back after Jhankaar Beats and delivers his best.\n2 good films in 2 weeks. Not bad Bollywood!\nRecommended!",

Coming onto this amazing flick...the premise is very simple n straightforward!!! But what makes it out standing is Vidya and Sujoy's amazing execution. Bollywood is moving onto a genre that is very much untouched and Vidya is leading the way. And how. If you thought she was awesome in 'The Dirty Picture'..'Kahaani' is highly recommended. And after 'Jhankaar Beats'..Sujoy Ghosh is back with a bang. Bollywood needs storytellers like him. Kolkata is captured in grand style and plays the backdrop of mesmerising story with a stunning character at helm. Only if we can get these kind of storytelling from all the upcoming directors!!!! Highly recommended!!!!!",
