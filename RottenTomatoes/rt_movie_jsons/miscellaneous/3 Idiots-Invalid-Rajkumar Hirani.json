Who was he? Some people would say he was a genius engineer, some would say he was an unreasonable eccentric, some would say he was an idiot in love. But no one really knew him. He did a lot of weird things with his friends, and did lots of stupid things in his relationship.  He was\" Lanche\" but also \"Wangdu\".  He took his degree in place of the children of the rich and then disappeared. Lanche came to the top university in India but single-handedly overturned the president's misconceptions about education. Unlike others, Lanche always learned flexibly, regardless of the details, and did  not memorize by rote. Although the teacher and dean did not like him, his grades always ranked first. He was an idiot in love, being afraid of kissing, until he met his wife, Pia. After the graduation ceremony, Lanche disappeared according to the original agreement and became a great scientist with 400 patents. At the same time, he created a school based on his ideal teaching principle.\n \nAnalysis\n              The double-line jacket structure is one of the greatest features of Three Idiots'. The bet between Lanche and the president at the beginning of the film combines \"the ideal life \" with \"reality \", which is an impressive innovation in film. \"Three Idiots is directed by Rajkumar Hirani, based on the debut novel Five Point Someone by Indian bestselling author Chetan Bhagat.\" This film combines many factors such as youth, campus, humor, family, friendship, love and so on.   The most impressive thing in the film is Lanche's mantra:'' All is well.\"  My favorite explanation of this short but powerful sentence is saying by Lanche that \"Can this solve the problem?\" \"It can't solve all the problems, but it at least gives us the courage to face the problem!\" What an optimistic attitude towards all the difficulties in life.  No matter what difficulties we encounter, we must use a positive attitude to face it, because all the challenges are the gifts from God. When I was around six years old, I watched Three Idiots for the first time, and that was the only thing I remembered. \"All is well\" is a powerful sentence which could give me the power to cool down and change my mind in a positive way towards the difficulties in life. Our hearts are very fragile, we must learn to coax them. Always tell your heart \"Everything is going well\". I have watched this movie more than ten times, and every time I watch it, I gain new thoughts and it also gives me faith to be myself, not a person to chill others or the society. Three Idiots is a great movie, but is more than a  movie. It is about life.\n \nCritique/Recommendation\n              I personally love this great film called \"Three Idiots \" . The whole movie made me understand many truths, and I have a new understanding of the definition of friends, the desire for knowledge, and the true love of life.  My favorite part of the movie is that Lanche always talks about how important it is to be happy, how important it is to take care of your emotions, but not about grades or the approval of others. In the end, through his own efforts, he changed the principal—\"only caring about grades, rather than paying attention to those important things. I think in him, I see a part of myself, and I even want to be like him a little bit. You will be amazed at how much you grow the second and third time you watch the movie---Three Idiot. Watching movies is also reading life.I highly recommend it and would give it 5/5 stars.",

            "content": "The film tells the story of three good friends Rancho, Farhan, and Raju studying at a prestigious school, Imperial College of Technology in India. The three students went to the university for different reasons. Farhan wanted to fulfill his father's wish, Raju wanted to improve the poverty of his family, and Rancho simply wanted to gain knowledge. In a school where grades determine everything, Rancho encouraged Farhan to follow his passion to become a wildlife photographer, heartened Raju to be more confident in himself and let go of his mental burden, and also persuaded the principal's daughter Pia to leave her fiancé who only cared about money. After Rancho, who challenged the education system with his attitude toward life, helped everyone find their value and meaning in life, he disappeared without a trace on the day of the graduation ceremony. When his friends tried to find him, they discovered that Rancho was not whom he said he was.\n\nThe theme of the movie is self-actualization. The message is to follow our passions to become successful and, more importantly, happy in life. Although Farhan loved photography, he entered engineering school to meet his father's expectations. His father firmly expected him to become an engineer to make more money. At that time, Farhan said, \"because he is not interested in engineering, even if he is an engineer, he will be a bad engineer.\" Encouraged by Rancho, Farhan made up his mind to pursue his passion for wildlife photography and drop out of engineering college. After ten years, Farhan became an outstanding photographer, and he cited what Rancho had been teaching him, to \"make your passion into your profession, then your work will become play.\" Throughout the movie, Rancho taught Raju and Farhan a lesson that doing what the world asks us to do instead of chasing what we love creates unnecessary stress, which can ultimately become a burden, hindering the way to a happy and fulfilled life. Working without enthusiasm and interest will eventually lead to mediocrity, rather than becoming successful. On the contrary, choosing a career that matches your interests may be more rugged, but with passions as the best backing and driving force, it is possible to stand out in a competitive environment.\n\nAnother message in the film that conveys the theme is to \"chase excellence and success will follow,\" a quote that was mentioned by Rancho in the movie. The protagonists studied in India's leading science and technology college. The principal is an old-fashioned professor who always judges students by grades. In his opinion, grades are everything. In contrast, Rancho is keen to practice the theories in the books because the purpose of his schooling is not just to get a diploma, but to learn knowledge and skills that can really solve problems and help in life. Despite the fact that he often gets into trouble at school, the results of each experiment give him valuable experience. There is a scene in the movie where Rancho was trying to help his senior make a camera drone with flaws in the design. Although the principal ruthlessly said that this thing has no practical significance, in the process of pursuing excellence, Rancho not only obtained relevant knowledge but also put the spirit of chasing excellence into practice. Chasing excellence is an attitude, and as long as we genuinely want to acquire that knowledge, and accumulate important experience in the process, there will naturally be a chance of success.\n\nI personally love the movie 3 Idiots. The director did a great job of making the movie and conveying the themes by using comedy and music. In addition to being extremely entertaining, through meaningful stories, this film also attempts to point out important issues in society that need everyone's attention but are ignored. However, if I were the director, I would convey that success is not necessarily the accumulation of wealth but also the continuation of happiness by making Rancho a happy teacher instead of a rich scientist in the end. Despite the criticism, I would still give it 5/5 stars and I highly recommend it.",

I appreciated that it wasn't linear, which actually helped setting up some mystery and revealing surprises that caught me off guard. The amazing story itself also helped. Although some of what the main character said about teaching was a bit too philosophical, the idea behind it in the movie were still impactful and relevant. Stress in school is a real deal, not only back in when the movie is made. I think that some better execution and writing could make the theme more impactful and profound, but this is still relatable enough. \n\nAnother great achievement was the mixing of serious theme with light-weight comedy. Despite how much I laughed at the funny jokes or goofy characters, this doesn't undermine the message that the movie was going for. That was not an easy thing to do, considering how usual Bollywood movies like to accommodate comedy. \n\nEven though I have problems with the movie, they don't bother me as much as others. The runtime was still long, as I think a good 15-20 minutes can be easily cut off. One part is to get rid of the musicals. All the musicals and dancings in the movie only occurred near the beginning, and most of them were not necessary, except the one that transitioned into a very dark scene. \n\nI said that the storytelling was solid, but the scenes where the characters got rewarded felt cheesy and not as satisfying as I wanted. \n\nOverall, I definitely see why this is one of the classics. 8-8.5/10",

So the day this movie featured on TV, I watched it. And I have seen it every single time it comes on TV. And afterwards I began laughing at them because I had seen it more number of times than them. But well, immaturity aside, let's review this movie.\n\nThe film talks about the rat race that everyone goes through, that we have been brainwashed into believing ever since we were teenagers. They always tell us that we need to get into a good engineering college if we want to have a good job irrespective of which field we work in, then that will play out when we have to get married, then we will have children and then the cycle will go on for them. We don't dare to think otherwise, because the elders always have a sense of insecurity about us and also because they always resort to shouting and scolding whenever we dare to question their authority.\n\nThe film has become something of a synonym with engineering life. Everyone learnt about the various things that happen in the top engineering college, because I think this is one of the first commercially successful Bollywood films to talk about the environment. There are three protagonists, each being a stereotype of an engineering student we all can relate to - Rancho the brilliant guy who doesn't study much but still gets good marks because he loves what he's doing, Raju who is a superstitious and cowardly guy coming from a poor household, and Farhan, a student who really has a passion for photography but his parents are forcing him to do engineering. Basically the three types of engineering students we all know.\n\nTogether they spend their college life in fun ways, teaching each other the meaning of life and the points of views of each person. And then after they leave college, they all decide to meet each other because of a \"challenge\" that Chatur, a teacher's pet had given them. Chatur wasn't exactly wrong from his point of view, since he came from Uganda, a country where Indians were being persecuted back in the late 20th century. He had learnt early in life that one has to take all means possible in order to achieve success, and that's exactly what he was going with.\n\nEvery time I watch this film I end up managing to find a new detail that I had previously missed. I watch it every time it comes on TV because of that reason. It was only later that I got to know this is actually a book adaptation of Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, and those friends of mine who laughed at me for not having seen this film are the same people who ridicule Chetan Bhagat for his terrible books. And to be honest they are kind of right, since this is his only good book adaptation. And by good I mean absolutely flawless.",

Time and again, Aamir Khan gives long winded speeches about the importance of education and happiness without any true substance behind them.

Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...\n\nComing to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well...

            "content": "3 idiots, a reunion story of three best friends from university, is a truly bold and ambitious film, tackling the immense and devastating consequences of rigid parental expectations, the competitive nature of academia, and suicide. For a movie that unequivocally embraces the 'fun' and upbeat aspects of Bollywood, it incorporates these heavy topics with surprising skill. Though I was skeptical of the insistence that when one commits suicide it is the direct result of another's actions, thus placing blame, I appreciated the consistent reassurances, in both plot and character dialogue, that life is worth living and one can overcome even the most desperate of situations. Mostly framed as a flashback, the audience is able to get glimpses of the friends' eventual successes while they are still fully immersed in university hardships. The final message is of a father's moral obligation to fully support and accept his children, truly exemplifying the shifted 'KJo' family, a concept explained by Sangita Gopal in his book Bollywood and Globalization. He writes, \"these films valorize the father's love rather than his authority and there is an odd reversal of generational priorities. The old do not oppose the desires of the young, but rather facilitate them\" (p.24).\nIn its most fun moments, 3 idiots is over the top, self-referential, and cinephilic, which is exemplified when Rancho asks Pia, his love interest, whether her hair blows in the wind when she sees her supposed 'true love'. Pia responds simply \" that doesn't happen in real life. This isn't a movie,\" which, of course, it is. In that way, the film reminds me of Main Hoon Na (2004) which stars fan-favorite Shah Rukh Khan. Khan's character, Ram, sings against his will in a forced swan pose to the woman he loves, making reference to another classic Bollywood trope. 3 idiots certainly diverges from classic Bollywood cinema in more ways than one, but still embraces and glorifies the best parts of its roots. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants a mix of serious hardship and inspirational triumph, but also to anyone who would like to see a dorm-shower dance number with at least dozen boys wearing nothing but towels and soap bubbles.",

Now almost ten years after its release, the film is still grossing high, being popular movie amongst generations in India and even around the globe. Although the film might be placed in the comedy genre, it is so much more, as in a span of three hours the audience experience everything from sadness and fear, to laughter and joy. The story revolves around three young engineering students, each of which have captivated the hearts of the audience in different ways, however, the protagonists Rancho, who was played my Amir Khan, not only teaches his friends, an important life lesson, but also us, his audience. Hirani uses Ranchoï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s character as a tool for criticism of the Indian education system and more importantly, the culture where Indian parents put very high expectations and stress on their children. Ranchoï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s values differ from his friends Farhan and Raju and the rest of the school, as he cares about learning rather than earning good grades, something that top educators donï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)t agree with him on. The overall life lesson of the film that Rancho keeps reiterating throughout the movie is to make your passion, your lifeï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s purpose, he challenges the pre-exciting beliefs that are set by the Bollywood rules, which is refreshing to see and experience. I would recommend this film to someone who has never seen Bollywood films before as it would it is lighthearted and very entertaining. Movies like Brahman Naman (2016) and PK (2014) are equally as entertaining and contain elements of romance, friendship and societal expectations.",

            "content": "Still considered Bollywood most top grossing and most popular film, 3 Idiots by Rajkumar Hirani questions the moral order of the education system in India and familial expectations of children. Having watched this movie four times, I have enjoyed it more every time. Hirani does a great job of using sarcasm and comedy to tackle the flaws in the education system and the expectations set by society on youth. Hirani questions the strict rules of the traditional system by examining it from an outsiders perspective. The film's protagonist, played by Amir Khan, is Rancho who comes into a very structured and strict society and questions its values from an unbiased, outside perspective. The use of such simplicity helps the audience understand the flaws of the system more easily and immediately persuades the audience to have sympathy for the people stuck in this rigid system. While the overarching themes of the movie were very well displayed, I was not a fan of the love affair formed between Rancho and Piya, as I felt their love was childish and immature. This speaks to the innocence of Rancho, however, it does not embody the true Bollywood version of love and passion. \n\nAmar Akbar Anthony, directed by Manmohan Desai, also explores the moral validity behind societies views on religion and family through comedy and drama in order to convey to the audience that despite religious differences, a sense of human morality is common amongst all people. Both 3 Idiots and Amar Akbar Anthony approach a rigidly structured culture that is accepted by society and provides a new way of thinking for those strictly structured rules. Desai did so by forming a scenario that leads the audience to understand the importance of human nature rather than religion, as all three brothers helped an unknown woman (their mother) and work together despite their religious identities. While Hirani tackled the strict societal norms by bringing in an outside perspective that looked at the strict rules and expectations and solved them through an innocent and straightforward mindset. Rosie Thomas, \"Melodrama and the Negotiation of Morality\" discusses how the 1/2 1/2 1/2Hindi film audience expects a drama that puts a universe of firmly understood- and difficult to question- rules into crisis and then resolves this crisis within the moral order (p. 164). This shows that the cinema finds a way to bend the strict rules of the universe to show the different possibilities that could come from them. It challenges these rules to show the audience new ways of structuring society and improving the moral universe as seen in 3 Idiots.",

Madhavan, and Sharman Joshi as the titular three idiots, this film is a coming-of-age dramedy that will have you laughing at one moment and crying in the next. Full of Bollywood staples-- including enchanting musical numbers, romance, ailing parents, disapproving authority figures and a commentary on current Indian society-this film will keep you entertained for its entirety.\n\tThree Idiots follows two university best friends (Madhavan, Joshi) as they journey to find their estranged leader Rancho (Khan). What follows is a masterful interweaving of both past and present as the audience is taken back 10 years to the \"idiots\" in university. Here, we learn of the bond between the three men and their plight for success in the Indian education system. As the audience is transported between the two timelines of Three Idiots, we are given a glimpse at the triumphs and perils of the rigorous academic system and the impact it had on the three \"idiots\". This film, like Main Hoon Na, comments on the faults of schools in India. However, when both films end audience members are left hopeful for the future of education in India. The education system underlies everything that occurs in Three Idiots, but this film is more than just an analysis on the school system. Three Idiots is a tale of homecoming, friendship, family, and love. From the lighting to the soundtrack, Three Idiots emphasizes the joy in life and the overall message of the film is a resounding reminder that \"all is well\".",

Simply, brilliant.\n\nSimple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman, Madhavan, Boman, Kareena & Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.\n\nSharman & Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth, panache, humour and love, that we don't want the journey to end.\n\nSharman really shows why he's one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. He's perfect in his role. Sharman, you rock!\n\nMadhavan as the guy who's chasing his father's dreams rather than his own is wonderful. The character who learns to laugh at life and it's ironies thanks to his friend Rancho. Madhavan shows his humorous side brilliantly savoring every scene and making it a pleasure to watch. His narration of the movie is very good.\n\nBoman Irani is probably the one actor we take most for granted just because he's so brilliant! His characterization of the control-crazy, hyper-active, hyper-competitive, almost dictator-ish, college principal, is beyond words. He plays it so so well, that you love to hate him. He's that Good.\n\nKareena comes through in this movie as one of the finest actresses we have. No one else could have played her part and also looked so beautiful at the same time.\n\nAnd now take it from a hard core Amitabh Bachchan fan, Aamir Khan is the best actor in town today after AB. Period.\n\nHis range is phenomenal and his characterization of 'Rancho' in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person who's not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, it's Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. \n\nAamir's ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.\n\nThis is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra.\n\nCliché word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10 Plot Two idiots Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) sets outs on a journey to find their lost friend and the 3rd idiot Rancho (Aamir).. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...\n\nMy Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to \"Five Point Someone\", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...\n\nBoth humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...\n\nTechnically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...\n\nComing to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...\n\nOn the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that \"chase excellence and success will follow\".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...\n\nSo to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...\n\nVerdict : THE BEST of 2009 ! Rating : 9/10We saw a sneak preview of 3 Idiots last night at Globus Cinema in Bandra, Mumbai.\n\nBrilliant.

Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra.\n\nCliché word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10 I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post.\n\nP.S. Don't forget to say 'Aal Izz Well'",

Aamir Khan as Rancho, R.Madhavan as Farhan Queshi and Sharman Joshi as Raju all give very good performances in their roles as the buddies who deal with a forgotten bet, attend a wedding that they are forced to crash and also have to deal with a funeral that is going badly wrong.\n\nThere is a really good performance to be had from Kareena Kapoor in her role as Pia, a medical student who Rancho falls in love with and she suits the role very well.\n\nThe direction from Hirani is excellent as he keeps a good pace going from start to finish, while the script is written superbly by the director, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidnu Vinod Chopra (who also produced) as there are really funny moments to be had and the soundtrack is good, with the song Zoobi Doobi standing out best.\n\nThis film swept the board come awards season in India as it won a total of 16 International Indian Film Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director, Actress (Kapoor), Supporting Actor (Joshi), screenplay, cinematography, editing and sound.\n\nThe film also won 6 Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Director and Supporting Actor, while also winning 2 Star Guild Awards and 3 National Film Awards.\n\nPerhaps the only criticism I would give the film is that it runs for too long, but nevertheless it is still a very enjoyable and really funny film from Bollywood.",

The movie is beautifully shot, with bright colours and locations typical of the genre, but what sets it apart is its unique plot of a group of university students looking to become engineers. The characters are all likeable, with strong acting from each. It also features several great musical numbers, though it is a little disappointing that they all took place in the first half of the film. On the down side, the movie brushes over issues such as suicide, as if they are just a regular occurrence that is just a fact of life. The lives of those lost are not cherished. I don't expect it to devolve into melodrama, but with three attempted suicides in the movie, it felt like a cheap ploy for drama. The movie also wraps itself up a little too neatly, though this certainly doesn't stand out in the genre. Overall, it is a good time, with a good message, but at three hours long, it can also feel a little preachy and drawn out. Check it out if you are interested in Bollywood but don't know where to start.",

After all, I watch a lot of foreign films since, let' s face it, the best few films in any year from other countries are going to be miles ahead of almost everything Hollywood cranks out. After watching 3 Idiots, I feel like the fourth idiot for not watching any Bollywood movies before. This reminded me of some of the best Hollywood song-and-dance pics of the 40s and 50s but with modern production values. It was a bit like, say, Chicago or Moulin Rouge. And did I mention that Aamir Khan is incredibly hot? Also like song-and-dance pics of the 40s, 3 Idiots doesn't need to resort to smut to entertain. So why only 4 stars? Maybe I need to adjust further to the conventions of the Bollywood pic, but there were a lot of moments that seemed needlessly overacted or downright silly. The production number taking place in the dormitory bathroom was not a high point, for instance. And I've never seen adult men cry so much in a picture. Ever. This may not be the most sophisticated picture you ever see, but it is unabashed fun without sex, profanity, or violence.",
