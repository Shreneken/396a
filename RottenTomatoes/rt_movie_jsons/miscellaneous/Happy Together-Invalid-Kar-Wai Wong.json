Their highly contentious relationship turns abusive and results in numerous break-ups and reconciliations. When Lai befriends another man, Chang (Chen Chang), he sees the futility of continuing with the promiscuous Ho. Chang, however, is on his own personal journey and, ultimately, both Lai and Ho find themselves far from home and desperately lonely.",

In some places it is boring, but quite interesting about the hardships of love as a common path to happiness. Well done by cinematographer Christopher Doyle (previously with Wai on \"Ashes of Time, 1994, and later with Phillip Noyce, Yimou Zhang and Jim Jarmush) - pictures from travels, lof andscapes (including impressive photos of Iguaz\u00fa Falls on the Argentine-Brazilian border) and the poor neighborhoods districts of Buenos Aires. Black and white photography is mixed with juicy, colorful in the right places where the action unfolds.",

            "content": "Soul searching in Buenos Aires.  So this is about two men (Leslie Cheung, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung).  They're romantically involved and vacationing in Argentina.  The trip was supposed to bring them closer together, but when the money runs out and they can't return home to China, they find themselves drifting apart.  This is one that I knew very little about aside from the plot description.  I randomized the Letterboxd Top 250 Narrative Feature Films again (which is quickly becoming my new go-to when I don't know what to watch), and this is the one that was sitting at the top.  Happy Together is not exactly a mainstream film, but if you're a fan of the art house, then hopefully it is already on your radar.  Happy Together is my first experience watching a Kar-Wai Wong film.  To this point, I only knew that he has a lot of clout in the critical community, but I didn't know what he was all about.  Now that I've gotten a taste, I can safely say that he is an auteur.  This is filmed in both black and white and in color, and it has a rather large effect on the general mood of the film as well as with the outlook these characters have on one another.  Kar-Wai Wong also slows down the frame rate at certain times, and I think that is to help to highlight certain moments.  It's a bit of a trippy effect since you hardly see this happen in dramas, but it is effective.  The cinematography is standout and stellar, and even after just one film, I can see why Kar-Wai Wong carries such a reputation as a director.  As far as the actual story goes, it is very slice of life.  These two men are caught in a very toxic cycle, so much so that it's clearly defined when one of them says, \"Let's start over.\"  Once the caretaking aspect is introduced to their relationship, you want it to work out since the dynamic shifts, but you just know it won't be long before a shoe drops because that is how cycles work.  If I were gay, this movie would probably mean more to me.  I'm not even saying that as a detriment, as it is a beautiful film that I appreciated from start to finish, it would just give me an extra level to connect with the story.  I had a similar feeling after I finished watching Brokeback Mountain, and different films will mean different things to different people.  Regardless of your sexual orientation, Happy Together is very much worth a watch.",

We spend half of the movie with this couple and let's say they are definitely not happy together. Fai lost all trust towards Po-Wing but can convince himself to let it go but also resists to not fall for him again. The second half of the movie follows Fai, alone, slowly (and in a very contemplative way) recovering. It's a slow movie but with interesting art directions, the most jarring it's the smooth transitions between black-and-white and deep colored scenes. None of the stories here will end in a satisfying way but will quietly phase out letting you wanting more.",

Wong Kar-Wai flourishes in this realm of mood, integrating saturated color and off-center framing to highlight the peaks and valleys of a turbid relationship; as with most of Wong's films, the plot is secondary to the establishment of a linear story, but that ties into the exploration of the love between Leslie Cheung's Ho Po-Wing and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai's Lai Yiu-Fai - relationships are not about an end destination, but the journey, the evolution along the way. Deeply contemplative and wholly engrossing, Wong knows how to keep the atmosphere simmering and the emotions running hot. (4.5/5)",

They are constantly fighting, giving each other a hard time slacking around. Sometimes there's work, sometimes there's not. They sleep, smoke cigarettes and is pretty much fed up with each other.\n\nThis could be a very flat and boring film, but Wongs way of moving the camera, finding the right angles and positoning helps a lot to make this a good film. Sometimes it's in black and white, sometimes it's not. Sometimes quiet, other times filled with music or backround noise. Always atmospheric. It's not a happy film, but not totally sad. It has some great acting and some true emotion. I guess it's about feeling lonely - in a way most people do every now and then.\n\nIt's a queer movie, but that's not important at all here. It gradfully turns into something better and that's pretty neat for something rather slowly moving. At times I have trouble separating the main characters from one another - a rather typical thing for me when it comes to Asian cinema. Not my favorite from the guy, but somewhere in the middle of the films I have seen from him so far.\n\n7 out of 10 lamps.",

It seems even more impossible now that this very open examination of a gay couple came out of Hong Kong.\n\nKar-wai Wong's film is still more graphic and honest than most any gay-themed films you are likely to see. Grounded firmly in reality but filmed and edited with highly intellectual and experimental stylings. It is an unforgettable and dark lament on the challenges of love within a the imposing marginalization of an already marginalized culture. Christopher Doyle's amazing cinematography almost presents itself as a third character in the story. \n\nKar-wai Wong was able to secure intense and often brutal performances from his two leading actors, the late Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung. Cheung had been a hugely pop star in Hong Kong and China in the 1980's. Tony Leung had soared to major stardom within a short time prior to the making of this film. \n\nA startlingly unsentimental \"love\" story, the movie both meanders and propels with rocket-speed. This film is like a sharp edged chair that you sometimes need to grasp tightly to keep us -- never mind the pain. \n\nUltimately this is a part of Queer Film Theory, but it is also a vital glimpse into the conflicts of human need vs. human desire. In some ways this is the profane and foul-mouthed cousin of Ang Lee's overly but achingly beautiful, \"Brokeback Mountain.\"  ...Things have changed in Hong Kong, but this is a story that will wrestle till the end of time -- and it is not limited to a \"gay couple.\"",

It's like watching a documentary, where the subject is 'the most dysfunctional Chinese same-sex couple in history.' If you've ever seen the movie 'Taxi Driver' by Martin Scorsese, you'll see that this movie has a similar atmosphere and darkness. The story isn't beautiful, but in the end it felt like I'd seen something beautiful. \n\nYui-Fai (Tony Leung) and Po-Wing (Leslie Cheung) arrive in Argentina to 'start over' with their relationship and take to the road for a holiday. When their relationship drifts apart, they get stuck in Argentina together. They fight, they love, they work, and they struggle to get back on their feet. It's a sad movie, yet you leave feeling happy.\n\nYou see their relationship fall deeper into darkness as they live together in a small apartment for a long period of time. They care about each other sometimes, and despise each other the rest of the time. There's very little narrative, which detracts from a fully emotional connection to the characters and their situations.\n\nHappy Together is gritty, dirty, realistic, and interesting. It gets major points for being daring and original. I don't care which way you spin it, Po did not love Yui-Fai. What they had wasn't love, it was familiarity. They stayed together because that's all they could do, which is why I wouldn't call this a romantic film.\n\nI have a feeling that this story would work better in a novel than it does on film. I put that down to the lack of information we're given about these two men. We don't know much about their thoughts or history.\n\nNothing is apparent, you have to read in between the lines to truly understand them. However, in Happy Together, the whole \"less is more' technique didn't really do any favors to the films overall enjoyablilty.\n\nThe REAL heart and soul came from the friendship between Yui Fai and Chang (Chen Chang). Chang was only a minor character, but for me he made the movie way more enjoyable. His presence gave me something to look forward to, for this movie is full of sadness. He was the light that the film needed.\n\nThe last half hour of the movie really picked up. There was hope and happiness there, and some excellent music and cinematography. I found myself feeling elated, and wanting to find out what happens next. Since the movie left me wanting more (which is a compliment), I'm giving it a solid four stars. It's beautiful, it's real, and it's unforgettable.",

More importantly, seeing the film wasn't the first time I considered selling my life and moving to Hong Kong on spec to try to work as his assistant, house painter, or personal fan club leader. His narratives are always simultaneously fantastical and grittily realistic. His character portrayals are achieved with minimal strokes that compel the viewer to fill in the rest just-so and to thus feel the fullness of the decisions/perspectives those characters have. I have never wanted to go to Ushiaia until this film and now I rue the passage of every year that I haven't been. May Wong Kar Wai make as many films as possible. An excellent film to pair with \"Fallen Angels.\"",
