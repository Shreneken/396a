It desperately wants to be an intriguing character study, and with Robert De Niro at the helm and Michelle Pfeiffer in support \u2013 both do fantastic work and carry the film on their backs -- it probably should have been. However, after all is said and done, there's no getting around how incredibly dry and disappointingly uninteresting it is considering who's involved.",

But the big question that is never answered is: WHY did a rich and successful man like Madoff start a fraud? He already was rich and successful. Why? How could the great talent behind the script fail to include a flashback or two to Madoff's childhood to explain his motivation? Were his parents terrible? Nevertheless, it's very watchable.",

The Wallstreet world is very interesting and complicated, and I find it to be quite Intriguing. This movie is a bit of an inside in this financial world, even though it's not a very positive story.\n\nThe storyline itself was very well done, and so was the acting. Robert De Niro was brilliant, you could see that he got frustrated once someone asked him about his work, because he was keeping this huge secret for everyone, and it started taking its toll. He could be so friendly to people, but then he would just snap to the people who are closest to him. De Niro did a very good job.\n\nI don't really understand why they decided to go with the \"we-tell-the-story-through-an-interview\" type of storyline because I didn't really know who the woman was that interviewed him, and we didn't get to know a lot about her or her work. So that's still a bit vague for me. Apart from that, a very interesting and well-done film I would for sure recommend!",

When they asked him how he traded stocks, he angrily told them, \"You run your business and I'll run mine\". What an asshole.\nMostly, I came away with Madoff's refusing to accept responsibility. He blames investors for being greedy. He never thought about how he would ruin lives if his scheme collapsed. He says, \"My problem is that I like to please people\". Bullshit. He likes ADORATION from people. He never gives a shit about the effect of his fraud on their lives. (hmmm... sounds like a president I read about lol).\nThe tragedy is the suicide of one of his sons. Even if he's got sociopathic tendencies (it's never stated if he did) that's gotta rip your heart to shreds.\nThis is a fine movie from fine people and a great character study of \"the banality of evil\". I get the feeling that if I ever met Bernie in his early days, I would have thought: nice, smart guy, but too fucking crude for my taste. I thoroughly enjoyed  this movie.",

I truly recommend watching this version as shown on HBO. Mr. De Niro not only captured the full essence of the character he portrayed, Bernard L. Madoff, he utterly made this role his own. To date, I believe this is one of his most stellar performances. Michelle Pfeiffer as Ruth Maloff was completely convincing. Giving us a glimpse of the life of a shattered wife. Ms. Pfeiffer has been one of my absolute favorite actresses since Grease 2. Alessandro Nivola stole the film to me, however. With his EPIC performance as Mark Madoff. Truly depicting the torment of an outcast pushed to his limits. If these three are not nominated for some kind of an award... I will start an Internet protest! Amazing film. Kudos to Barry Levinson for such a brilliant work on creating the Bernie Madoff story, The Wizard of Lies. On a scale of 1-10... I rate this movie a 12.",

However, this doesn't come close to living up to it.  \n\nThis movie could have been a great exposition on what drives people to commit crimes of such a magnitude, especially a person who was once the paragon of ethics and prudence and who was revered in his industry.  Just the transition from law-abiding citizen to master criminal would have been fascinating to watch, not to mention how he put his criminal plans into operation.\n\nBut, no, nothing like that.  No transition and very little on the criminal operation.  The focus is almost entirely on Madoff and his family during the trial and his incarceration.  While the wife and children deserve our empathy, by focusing on the private life of Bernie Madoff he is made out to be more of a victim than a villain, which is a preposterous thought.  \n\nThus there is very little engagement, as the central character is certainly not worth supporting.  This generally makes for a fairly flat experience.  \n\nThere are some interesting intrigues and sub-plots and these are tellingly felt in the last few scenes, as Madoff's crimes impact his family.  \n\nOverall: watchable, but could have been so much better.",

After not seeing Michelle Pfeifer in so many years I found her also unconvincing. I can't figure it out....the script or her acting?  Was this supposed to be about his family?
