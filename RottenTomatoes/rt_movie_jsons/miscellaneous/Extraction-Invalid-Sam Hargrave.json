There are long takes spanning from street level to roof top to building jumping to descent to car chase to hand to hand combat to grand theft auto to...you get the idea. Fantastically complex stunt choreography & fantastically entertaining. One of the most fun action movies we've seen. My only criticisms are very small details like being a little bit more realistic with gunshot wounds. It's so hyper realistic in fight sequences that it seemed odd to have the wounds not match. Meaning, if a person gets shot with an assault rifle, if you want them to survive the shot, maybe don't let them get shot in the chest & the neck. It's also not a movie made for plot or character development, so don't come to this movie looking for high art. It's an action movie & it knows that it's an action movie. On those terms, as far as action movies go, Extraction is about as cool as it gets.",

The main character's fearlessness is a good trait that also makes sense within the story and it adds a bit more charm to him.

I'm a little interested in this considering the fact that it didn't grab my attention. But on the other hand I put it on and I really enjoyed it. We have Tyler Rake played by Chris Hemsworth, who is a mercenary recruited by his handler Nik Khan, to save Ovi from the men who kidnaps him. He kills one of them and takes him to the extraction point. Along the way he comes across Saju who he has to save Ovi himself and the mission is more f**ked when the crime lord orders the police to initiate an immediate lockdown of Dhaka, securing all bridges and travel points out of the city. After seeing this, I just saw the names pop up and recognising the filmmakers like the Russo brothers who produced it along with Chris Hemsworth. You get to hear the Russo brothers directing one of the Marvels films like Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. It looks like you're watching the same movie but with them but not with Thor because he's playing a different character. There's also an action scene that is so long it is a long shot scene it is absolutely phenomenal. I'd never expect to see a long shot action scene that never stops. It goes on and on and on! This goes on for over 10 minutes. Afterwards Saju had a broken nose and as he was putting it back in place you can hear the crack and see the blood pouring in the sink. Really graphic! So if you're fan of Chris Hemsworth and wanting to see more of him, this is the one that'll peek your interest. Me, I enjoyed it for what it is especially thinking about the Russo brothers doing the MCU flicks. So yeah, more Netflix films coming soon.",

A big time Indian don's son is kidnapped to Dhaka Bangladesh. The don must contract a black market mercenary (Chris Hemsworth in a really kinetic role). Extraction feels like a 80s/90s film on steroids, with the action trying to imitate the action intensity of the John Wick series. If it were made during that time, you can clearly see an Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone type in Hemsworth's role. Its a movie based solely on a simple concept, and loading that concept with grand and explosive action sequences. Hemsworth is great in this film. His career hasn't been as successful as his other Avengers counterparts, but when given the right kind of material, he can shine. The rest of the cast are good in their respective roles as well. Randeep Hooda, whose predominantly a Bollywood actor, is great as the henchman for the don. Rudhraksh Jaiswal, who plays the kidnapped kid, is decent, while Golshifteh Farahani is cool and intense as the mercenary partner to Hemsworth's character. There's a small cameo by David Harbour, which kind of feels a little convenient towards the predicament for the main characters, but other than that the performances are mostly solid. The action set pieces are great, and you can tell they're done with lot of practise and precision. Many of the scenes are filmed and edited to mimic the now popular \"one shot\" feeling, and it works out, giving an almost video game feeling. The movie is super violent, but it deems necessary considering the subject matter. Outside of the kind of cheesy final scene, Extraction is a great action film, and a great Netflix movie! Definitely go stream it!",

            "content": "Extraction is probably the most action-packed thriller of the modern day. This movie is full of explosions, guns, explosions and more guns.\n\nI really enjoy watching movies like this as they are, to me, just entertaining. This is the same with Netflix's most watched original movie to date...Extraction. The reason I think that this is so great is because it takes risks, in many scenes, and events in this feature. However, because action movies today are mostly just that, action movies, the plot, and characters are just knocked down to the under-level and it should be easy to see in this film aswell. Before I get to the negative stuff, I would like to appreciate the director (Sam Hardgrave) for his camera work on this movie, of course he had his influences, but good job to him for his hand-held camera work, specifically during the pseudo-one take in the 2nd Act, it was truly impressive how I noticed no cuts or stitches whatsoever.\nFor our main protagonist, Tyler Rake (Played by Chris Hemsworth), that is where we probably get the closest to an understandable protagonist. He is a lonely man, who just wants all the money he can get to provide himself with, he also lost his son to lymphoma at a young age and split up with his wife. When hearing on these events, I did feel somewhat sympathetic towards the character, but that could be just because Chris H is such a likeable and nice guy. The next character that I want to talk about is the victim of the main event in this movie, Ovi Mahajan (Played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal), we do get a small segment into what his life was like, of course with him being the son of the biggest drug lord in India. This section comes very early on and only last us a few minutes, not really giving us much time to relate to him as much as possible, we also never see him directly with his father in a scene so the only insight we get into their relationship is a small statement from Ovi in the later half of Act 2, implying they do not have a happy relationship, we also learn that he usually plays piano when he gets nervous, trying to give us sympathetic feelings for him. Me personally, I would have liked to have known more about the kid's private life, for example: Who was his mother? Where is she? Why is his father in prison? How does he know Saju?\nThere are many side-characters in this movie that I feel, considering the job they have, were taken out of the equation far to easily. The reason they did this, I do understand, they needed those characters to die just to demonstrate visually how Saju (Played by Randeep Hooda) is as skilled fighter just as much as Tyler Rake. There could have been many other ways to do this other than to kill off all our ‚Äòmain' protagonists in the space of 2 minutes, for example, Saju could have killed some Dhakan police officers in an interesting way to show this. If this happened then a much more interesting and investing plot could have taken place, meaning our protagonists could have had to band together to get out alive, or maybe they achieve early on at getting the kid out, but something happens to change that.\n\nFor the most part, this movie definitely achieves what it is trying to do with action, so if you just want a reasonably fun and realistic take on a John Wick style movie, then this is definitely for you, despite it's rather barebone plot.",
