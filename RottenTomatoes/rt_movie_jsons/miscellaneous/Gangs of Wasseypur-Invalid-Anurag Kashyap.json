It is better if it is treated almost like a miniseries due to its slow premise (but never disengaging). The payoff is worth it if you have a bit of patience. Powerful acting displays with no weak links whatsoever. A weird and quirky score but worked well with the tone of the film. Highly recommended!",

This is the best gangster movie Bollywood has ever made, and that's saying something since Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai also exists.\n\nWhen the film begins, it seems like it will be the same old, generic good guy vs bad guy movie. But as the story progresses, the line between the good and bad people blurs to the point where it doesn't exist anymore. In the beginning it feels like Sardar Khan is supposed to be the hero, but slowly he's shown to be a terrible person who gets in fights with everyone and marries a second time just because he's getting horny.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui's Faisal is introduced in the second part after the demise of Sardar Khan. The bad guys really make you feel like killing them, and the way they speak is very reminiscent of the villages from Bihar and east UP. The acting by literally everyone is phenomenal, such that it inspired memes for years to come, and that's being in a good way. Every scene has been choreographed so well it actually gives you the feeling of those poor, low class families from suburban areas.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many web series come up - Mirzapur, Paatal Lok, Sacred Games. The fact remains that Gangs of Wasseypur is the OG that started it all, and no one can ever replace its legacy.",

The story is a long one that spans many decades and is told in two parts with a total runtime that surpasses five hours. Despite the long runtime, I found myself mostly engaged with the movie and I did feel that every scene contributed to either the story or developing the characters. However, on the same token, the movie had a lot of moments that I did feel bored by since it is sometimes uneventful. Regardless, I still think as a whole, the film leaves a strong impression, with shocking violence at every corner, and storylines that impact future events. The strong performances in the movie feel authentic and add to the realism the movie is going for and every character is complex. It's a unique film for Bollywood as it is more commonly compared to Hollywood films such as \"The Godfather\" or works by well-known director Martin Scorsese. While watching the movie I understood why these comparisons are made so frequently as the film has a similar look and feel to the films it is compared to.",

The Khans vie against the Singhs for power, control, and revenge. This is a little more like watching Fredo raise a family than capturing Michael's astute rise to power, and it's all the more fun for it. We don't get enough of the catalytic patriarch Shaheed Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat). We spend a little too much time with his philandering asshat of a son Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpayee), but even he occasionally amuses and leaves us with several sons sparring for the role of don. The ultimate godfather being Faizal Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), who is certainly my favorite.\n\nThe movie is admittedly long (technically 2 parts). It could be shorter if the montage sequences set to music (but not dance!) were cut, but I'm not sure I would want that. The soundtrack is dope as hell, and while the story isn't really moving during the not quite Bollywood as I knew it music scenes, the lyrics and beats are killer. GANGS opens with a one shot capturing an attack on the current Khan in charge. I didn't think the action scenes could be more epic than the opening, but I was mistaken multiple times. Also, what an excellent use of slow motion! This movie is not for the faint of constitution, but if you're a HARDBOILED fan, do yourself a favor and check out GANGS OF WASSEYPUR.",

Taking his cue from the likes of Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, Kashyap fashions a grand tale of greed, politics, survival, vengeance and violence in the small coal mining town of Wasseypur in the Dhanbad district in north-eastern India.  Interestingly, Kashyap deftly showcases India's corrupt politics, the inexorable link between money, crime and politics and society's obsession with the popular cinema with the control and discipline of a master puppeteer.  His eye is never critical, but more observational, making the film more chilling and brutal.  Keeping the pace brisk, the action constantly engaging and the tone realistic, he fashions a gangster saga for the ages, using multiple strands to tell a story of warring factions fighting for control of the coal and iron businesses in the region in a tale as great and complex as India itself.  It is sometimes hard to keep track of all the characters and their links to this great tapestry, but the brisk pace and compelling storytelling will draws you in and refuse to surrender you till the last reel.  Repeated viewing will only serve to further enhance and appreciate the sheer raging brilliance of this film, which will make you change your opinion of Bollywood forever.",

Having said that, the movie suffers from 'passion project syndrome'...at times it feels like the director and writer did not want to let go of any of the scene. Result, it stretches too long and very poorly edited. The movie suffers from the structure issue from the script and in the second half may feel like episodic in nature.\nOverall, wonderful try from the director known to venture into risky stories with success in comparison to his peers in indian cinema and he almost gets it right.",

A tale of revenge that runs in the family, three generations down thereby unleashing a wave of killings. \n\nThe first part was completely owned by Manoj Bajpai (Sardar Khan) whose impeccable performance reaches far. Whether comic lines, serious taunts or seducing Reema Sen or playing husband to Richa Chadda, he is simply brilliant. Very well supported by other actors. The second part was dominated by the pot smoking Nawazuddin Siddiqui (Faizal Khan) as he aims to continue taking revenge on Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia) for killing his grandfather, the same way Sardar Khan spent his whole life taking revenge for his father's murder. Second part adds on more lively characters in the Khan family, like Perpendicular and Definite, who are new actors but nonetheless great to watch. \n\nThe ending somehow let me down because during the last quarter it was clearly evident as to where the movie was headed. Brilliant music score by the newcomer Sneha Khanwalkar is very raw, witty, different and touches the right notes with regards to the theme of the movie.

            "content": "The sequel to Gangs of Wasseypur starts with the death of Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai). We see him getting caught in a barrage of gunshots and finally succumbing to it. The scene of his funeral is comical to a certain extent with a singer with an unusual voice singing a famous Hindi number. Immediately after this scene, we are taken back to the gruesome world of murder and mayhem that Anurag Kashyap had shown us in Gangs of Wasseypur.\r\n\r\nThis world is laden with men who mould themselves after Bollywood heroes and with revenge in their hearts; they roam around the town of Wasseypur coolly creating a realm of violence and crime. Amidst all the chaos and bloodshed, Anurag Kashyap and his crew follow a curios path of violence, humor, romance and music to bring out a revenge story that spans generations.\r\n\r\nAfter watching Gangs of Wasseypur, it might seem that the sequel is lacking in parts. Despite the exuberance, you will feel the movie is nothing but a series of butchering and killing with no particular story that links them together. There are times when logic flies out of the window. The prequel took time to bring out the characters and the storyline. However in the sequel, we get to see nothing but a bunch of wannabe crime lords battling it out with guns, murdering and creating mayhem in broad daylight. It seems the characters are just moving according to the set of instructions given by the director.\r\n\r\nOne of the funny moments in the movie comes up when we see a gangster attempting to tie the string on his pajama while talking on two mobile phones. We have an edgy assassin on one phone while a spy who has been asked to follow a target is on the other phone. The scene is cleverly written and portrayed.\r\n\r\nChase scenes have been the forte in Gangs of Wasseypur II. But they seem to have been stretched too far. One felt that Anurag Kashyap was trying to out-do himself after the fantastic chase scenes in Black Friday. He was trying to go a notch higher. The starts in the four chase scenes in the movie are brilliant and exciting, but the brilliance and the interest seem to fade away after a few minutes.\r\nHowever like Gangs of Wasseypur I, Kashyap is brilliant in bringing out the characters in the sequel. We are introduced to a group of charismatic personalities. Apart from the growing enmity between Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia) and Sardar Khanâ(TM)s hash-addicted successor Faisal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), we come to know of Perpendicular. He is Faisalâ(TM)s kin who has the habit of wielding a blade in his mouth and goes around with an I-donâ(TM)t-give-a-damn attitude. Faisal is a hardcore follower of Amitabh Bachchan while his half-brother Definite thinks Salman Khan is God. Faisalâ(TM)s wife Mohsina is a movie-addict who sings in a queer voice at the slightest opportunity. Faisal is shown as a person who, despite his unwillingness, was dragged into the world of crime. Together with Definite, they go about carving a revenge for the murder of their family members. \r\n\r\nThe movie is a goldmine of stellar performances. Richa Chadha as the sturdy matriarch, Aditya Kumar (Perpendicular) and Huma Qureishi (Mohsina) are brilliant and brings their characters alive. However, the one person that has made a mark for himself with his brilliant performance is Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who has essayed the role of the bold Faisal Khan. \r\n\r\nIf there is any fatal mistake in the movie, it is the introduction of innumerous subplots and characters. This trend continues till the end of the movie. This one major flaw has stopped Gangs of Wasseypur II from rising above the genre of a typical revenge flick.",

Direction, screenplay, narration, acting, music, cinematography, everything about this movie is top notch. Anurag Kashyap is truly the best at whatever he does. You wont even feel the length of 5 hours and 20 minutes. Manoj Bajpai's has proved once again that he is the powerhouse of acting. Not one scene is out of order and everything is properly explained with no questions unanswered. Dialogues are very sharp and as close to reality as it can get.\n\nThe opening sequence in itself is a masterpiece. The way its scripted and executed is just mind blowing. All the bloodshed keeps getting more and more innovative. Its one of those movies that will always be mentioned everywhere whenever someone talks about the Indian cinema.",

Subtle artwork direction in a commercially viable venture is classic. It explains everything yet says nothing. The end that ensure the completion of the saga far removed from Wasseypur, the impotent narrator with the baby and bahu, and the two people who are highly integrated in this mess of betrayal left standing with their \"jurisdictions\" divided. Painful, yet true. \n\nFaizal running from terrace to terrace during the shooting is my favourite scene. Done in film noir, handheld camera, and absence of background music - the scene heightens to a wonderful peak of tension climaxing at the breaking of the leg coupled with the phone ringing in the background.\n\n\"Anytime moodwa ko, upsetaoon nahi mooda\"",
