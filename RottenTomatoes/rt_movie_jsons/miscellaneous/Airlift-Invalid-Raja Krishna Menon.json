The main plus of this film is that it feels it is directly speaking to you, which is not the case with many Bollywood films. i still feel this film had many overblown and unnecessary sequences but it is a decent watch. ill leave it at that.",

I felt that at any moment the stakes were high and anything could happen. When something dangerous happens to any of the characters, I genuinely felt the breakneck intensity. I do feel the movie does go back in forth in terms of pacing but for the most part, it was solid entertainment. It's not a conventional Bollywood movie, but it works for the story it trying to tell.Â ",

This tells the story about how one man managed to save them all and bring them back to the safety of India.\nThis was an epic movie and well done. It is two hours long and does take some time to get through but totally worth it.\nWhat gets to me is we watch these kinds of movies and it shows us how we are the same and no matter where we come from our backgrounds our religious beliefs why can we still not see each other as one family.\nWhy does it take tragedy or war for us to wake up to see that we are all part of one human race.\nWatch the movie and hopefully you will be touched by a powerful true story about what humanity is capable of from both sides.",

            "content": "The first thing you notice about Airlift is that Akshay Kumar no longer plays the role of a buffoon.\nHis career has always been a study in contrasts - from juvenile mediocrity like Housefull to hard-hitting, edge-of-the-seat drama like Special 26, no actor in Bollywood has entertained (and disappointed) us quite as frequently as Akshay has.\nAs Ranjit Katyal, a wealthy businessman who dons the hat of saviour during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, however, Akshay delivers a career-best performance.\nDirector Raja Krishna Menon's new film throws the Middle Eastern crisis of 1990 and the geopolitical dynamics that surround it into sharp relief, following a narrative template that largely mimics that of Ben Affleck's Oscar-winning masterpiece, \"Argo\".\nShops are ransacked, proud skyscrapers are razed to the ground and innocent citizens are ruthlessly murdered in cold blood, and all these take place in broad daylight.\nPredictable, it falls to our hero to orchestrate what turns out to be the largest civilian evacuation in modern-day history.\nWhile the storyline and its execution is predictably routine, where Airlift succeeds is in creating a claustrophic, nerve-racking atmosphere that will leave you gasping on the edge of your seat.\nThe acting is uniformly good throughout the film, save for Inaamul Haq's ridiculously over-the-top performance as an Iraqi war general that wouldn't have seemed so out of place in a B-grade Sajid Khan comedy. His pseudo-Arabic accent gets on your nerves every single time he appears on the screen and is by far the film's biggest weakness.\nMenon also needlessly injects random songs into the screenplay that not only disrupt the film's narrative flow but also amply demonstrate the need for greater subtlety in Indian filmmaking.\nAkshay's terrific performance, however, makes up for many of this film's weaknesses.\nAirlift is a film that attempts to reach stratospheric levels of perfection.\nAs things stand, though, it just about manages to take off, and that it does well.",

Everything was nice in the movie but not Excellent, I expected a sort of more from Akshay Kumar after Baby(Movie). Speaking Numerically I stepped in to expect to give an 8 after interval I thought to give 6 and after the movie I'm giving an 7. The Things that I liked about the movie was obviously acting by Akshay Kumar, because he wasn't loud like his previous movies, Purab Kohl was Midas as Always. Technically the movie felt good, the story concept was good, characterization was average, because there were too many character. The things that I didn't like about the movie was that actresses like Nimrat Kaur and Feryna Wazheir weren't utilized properly, It was the first time I saw Nimrat Kaur on screen after hearing praises about her, but I was let down as she felt as an Rich Punjabi housewife nothing else, Feryna Wazheir's A talented theater actress and her Talent wasn't used properly either. The other thing is TOO MANY MALYALEE CHARACTER representations, even the role of there General felt to be a bit on funny side instead of the serious one. BOTTOM LINE: You should obviously go to see this movie once, but it's not an that type Masterpiece but you'll like if it even though. You'll over like it if you are Pretentious Indian(No Offense).",

            "content": "At the end of each year, audiences have been subjected to a crude and bizarre concoction of preposterous ideas that are formulated in Rohit Shetty's head and somehow, the masses just cannot get enough of it. But silently, as though compensating for such frivolous cinema, there has been one annual film starring Akshay Kumar that has some realism, patriotism, focused storyline and some solid performances. With 'Special 26', 'Holiday', 'Baby' and now with 'Airlift', Akshay Kumar proves his caliber as a hero that one can relate to and not the over-the-top nonsense portrayed in a vast majority of action films these days. Directed by Raja Krishna Menon, Airlift relives the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 that threatened 170,000 Indian residents who left their homeland for better opportunities but were then stuck in a land without much of an identity. Now, it is up to one man to let go of his selfish motives and guarantee the security of his fellow countrymen in trying times as the Iraqi forces become more unpredictable. \n\n       A brief intro and a song later, we are directly in the middle of the Iraqi forces storming into Kuwait city. While the locals get brutally executed by Saddam's fanatic army, the sub-continent population faces uncertainty and is constantly threatened even though they may not be identified as Kuwaitis. Realizing that his property, assets and family are at stake all of a sudden, businessman Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar) decides to find a refuge for his company's workers while pleading for protection from a fickle Iraqi General. In no time, the office space is crowded with not just his workers but also their friends and family. With supplies running low, he desperately seeks to arrange for food and shelter for a few thousand and soon enough, the bigger refuge area now camps over 150,000 Indians due to Katyal's tireless efforts. \nWhile this arrangement provides some temporary relief, everybody is on the edge because of the anarchy outside their doors. In the absence and negligence of the local government, Katyal reaches out to officials in New Delhi to enable a rescue from the war zone but the bureaucracy and nonchalance from the babus left their fates hanging in the hands of a dangerous regime. \nThere was but one last hope for Ranjit; to lead them all to Amman, Jordan through an arduous journey and uncertainty of border crossings, while an official in New Delhi sought to mobilize alliances and volunteers to aid a rescue operation. \n\n     Airlift contains some pretty powerful moments that depict the trauma and stress during the invasion. The intensity of the first encounter between Iraqi soldiers and Ranjit, the traumatic drive through streets filled with military executing Kuwaitis outside their homes, the erratic behaviour of Iraqi soldiers as they raid the camp and the border crossing through Iraq were effective in portraying the emotional turmoil of the numerous individuals who faced those dangers. \nThere are light shades of patriotism that don't follow the #nationalism falseness that is rampant in current times. There are moments of heroism defined by one's actions towards a common good, through selfless deeds that make Ranjit's character even more likable. \n\n     Akshay Kumar delivers a powerful yet subdued performance, just like he does every year in that one exceptional film. This time however, his acting is much more composed and thoughtful. With a sound understanding of the character and situations, he is able to deliver one of his career best acts. Nimrat Kaur has one stellar scene where she defends her husband's deeds of bravado that get misunderstood by an idiot in their company. The lashing she verbally delivers is far more potent than any other form of rebuttal. Purab Kohli is excellent too in his supporting role as he fights his tragedies in the face of danger that threatens the thousands around him. \n\n\n     Soch na sake is a typical Arijit Singh melody, dil cheez tujhe dedi is ofcourse inspired by Khaled's didi from yesteryears while tu bhoola jise is deeply inspiring with its patriotic theme and is beautifully sung by Amaal Malik and KK. \nRaja Krishna Menon has not only achieved box office success for an honest film but also some well deserved acclaim for portraying true events with the right intention of reflecting upon the sacrifices made and hardships faced by thousands of Indians. Ranjit Katyal is a fictionalized version of the true heroes who stood up back then to save several who lost their identities in times of war. He brought them back home in troubled times, thus reflecting a powerful characteristic of human nature and Akshay Kumar, makes it all the more real. \n\n  - 9.002 on a scale of 1-10.",

            "content": "Airlift is an amazing film and I like to state that in the beginning. Airlift evokes a sense of patriotism that is so real, and not gimmicky as we see with other Indian films. Here everything is extremely sharp, real, gritty and raw. One feels as they have been thrown into a war zone, its a very film authentic. Hence its a very brutal, and sometimes hard to stomach, but its exhilarating. We rarely (if ever) get to see a film like this made in India which is made on such a huge scale, and talks of a real story of how 1,70,000 Indians were stuck in Kuwait during the time Iraq and Saddam Hussain attacked Kuwait in 1990. Its of international standards. What ones sees in the film will leave you teary eyed, you will be left gasping, and finally all Indians will feel proud of Airlift. This film is a gem that should be watched by all Indians, it left me speechless because we rarley get to see good cinema nowadays but Airlift is what we categorize as a classic. The human emotions, the amazing camework, the great visual effects, the thrilling screenplay, and above all the best acting I have seen in a film for awhile by Akshay Kumar. Akshay Kumar deserves a national award for this film, the man is the film, he has given his all to Airlift. His act has a goose bump arising affect. Without Akshay Kumar there is no Airlift, this is probably his best act ever. He is mind blowing. But more of indepth analysis later.\n\nStory wise Ranjit Katyal is a shrewd businessman who liked enjoying the high society life of Kuwait. His wife Amrita Katyal is happy in her own world with her little daughter. Their world is turned upside down as Iraq invades Kuwait on August 2, 1990. Circumstances get the best or worst out of people. Ranjit who was a selfish businessman turns a new leaf as he watches his driver murdered in front of his own eyes. He along with a group of rich friends organises a camp for 1, 70, 000 Indians. The subsequent days are a glorious account of his powerful negotiating skills with enemies as well as friends. \n\nActing wise Airlift probably has one of the best ensembles seen in a hindi film after a long time. Akshay Kumar like stated before is MINDBLOWING. He is completely restraint, but what he conveys in his eyes, is what you call acting. I cant single out one scene,but he is outstanding in the whole film. Give him all the Indian film awards he deserves them. Nimrat Kaur character is completely real and she stands out in her monologue just after the interval when Tipu Sultan the ship is sent back. She is at her fiery best in that speech.Kumud Mishra is a revelation,this mans relentless act will leave you in awe. Prakash Belawadi is first rate as the annoying, but eager helpless south indian wanting to go back home. Purab Kohli is good. Inaamulhaq is the only miscast, and is a caricature of a Iraqi general, his accent was horrible.\n\nAirlift shows the true grim side of war, the stuff news channels dont want to cover, the reality of how thousands of Indians were left stranded in Kuwait during the 1990s in a oil war with Iraq. Within 24 hours all Indians rich or poor were left to beg on the streets, and Kuwaitis were being killed with no regard. When this is shown 15 min into the film, one knows an amazing film is coming and that Airlift shows all this in a extremely honest and true light. Nothing has been commercialized, or shown out of perspective. And thats the film biggest strength, being truthful, and not taking cinematic liberties. The film is gritty, raw, and real. Airlift is also very thrilling, and will leave you at the edge of your seat with your heat pounding at many instances. You cant move your eyes from the screen for even a second, its that gripping.The camerawork is amazing, and has shown war time Kuwait amazingly, everything just looks so real, and grim. The sets, the clothing, the cars, the production values in general are of international standards. The visual affects are first rate. The film has almost no negatives.The only thing that bothered me was the slow pace at times and the casting of Inaamulhaq as the general he was a complete miscast, and annoying. But were Airlift wins your heart is in the films true message of how brave India, and Indians are, we are responsible for the biggest evacuation in the history of the world. Its truly inspiring to think India actually airlifted 1, 70, 000 people out of a war zone. Its truly a bravo moment. The film is a classic piece of cinema for India. If America has saving private ryan, argo etc We have Airlift. We can proudly say that, thanks to Director Raja Menon who made such a inspiring true tale about India. He created such a huge canvas its truly applaud worthy. \nHe made sure the film was of international standards in all aspects. The dialogues also standout especially my favourite \" Aadmi ki fitrat hi aisi hai Ibrahim,Jab chot lagti hai tab ma ma hi chillata hai.\"That dialogue gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. The song tu bhoola jise is going to be the new Indian anthem, its a beautiful patriotic song. Finally the films biggest highlight is the last 20-30 min, and when you see the first flight take off, you will be left in tears. Once again bravo Mr. Akshay Kumar, what you did with this film, has made sure I am a fan forever.\n\nFinally I will not preach anymore just go watch Airlift this republic day, and do yourself a favour. Its a must watch for all Indians, not because its a film that will make you feel patriotic, because its a cinematic masterpiece. Vande Mataram!!!\n\n5/5* or 10/10",

            "content": "Akshay Kumar is one of the most unique stars of Bollywood as he  manages to make films both for the masses & the classes alike. For every Special 26 & Baby, he has Holiday & Gabbar is Back to back it up. And much like Ben Affleck's Argo (it may seem inspired, but its not), this latest Akshay Kumar outing is the celebration of human spirit. It is based on a highly improbable story that just couldn't have been true, had it not been based on a real life event. Based during the Gulf war of 1990. Iraq acquired Kuwait, while causing ruthless slaughter of its citizens. More than 1.5 lakh of Indians were stranded in Kuwait; afraid, helpless, hungry, unable to escape from the catastrophic violence which was shaking the entire world. While the Government of India couldn't care less about the its people who were crying out for help, an Indian businessman residing in Kuwait came forward at the assistance of his fellow countrymen. He gambled with his life, his family, his money; and managed to evacuate all the Indians safely. Air India, for this, holds a Guinness Book Record. If the story just gave you goosebumps, then this film is for you. This film by Raja Krishna Menon (Barah Aana) couldn't be any better. With this film he has hit straight, deep down our hearts. An unmatched feat of diplomacy, co-ordination, and logistical effort, the evacuation is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise-blemished record of addressing the needs of migrant Indians caught in the cross-hairs of war. The operation required the involvement of scores minds at the top and the bottom of the diplomatic pyramid, including serving foreign minister IK Gujral, but the film claims that one and only one man was responsible: the fictional businessman Ranjit (Akshay Kumar), whose high-level contacts and humongous bank balance make it possible to spearhead the entire rescue. (Ranjit is described in the end credits as a composite of two real-life businessmen who helped with the operation.) The is a very deft movie made without any added dramatic effect and that is clearly visible in the way director Raja Menon has put together the movie. It is shot realistically and the detailing is impressive. There are no spiced up revelations, the lead protagonist doesn't end up fighting his advisories. The film maintains a whiff of humanity throughout its run-time and it takes a lot of courage and ambition to tell such a lesser known story in such an ambitious manner. The story follows Ranjit Katyal (Akshay), an Indian business man who considers himself to be Kuwaiti and loves the extravagant lifestyle of the Middle East nation. Ranjit lives with his wife Amrita (Nimrat Kaur), who seems to be primarily busy with their kid. But things quickly turn sour when one night in August 1990, the Iraqi army suddenly marches onto the streets and invade Kuwait. By a twist of fate, the lives of 170,000 Indians living in Kuwait takes a turn for the worst. In bargaining for safe passage for his wife (Nimrat Kaur) and daughter, the previously hard-headed Katyal finds himself negotiating for the safety of his employees, and gradually, for the entire Indian population in Kuwait. Soon, all 170,000 are holed up in a makeshift camp, with Katyal trying to stir the Indian authorities into action while keeping the Iraqis calm. The film chronicles the journey from the first day of invasion to the final climax where a timely Airlift by civil aircraft saves many lives. The film begins inauspiciously, with a desultory dance number that's lifted from Cheb Khaled's Didi in the first 10 minutes. Remarkably, director Raja Menon hardly puts a foot wrong after that. From the party, the scene shifts to a labor camp, with workers preparing for bed. Suddenly, there's an explosion. The camera pulls out, and in a long, extended shot, we see fires burning and tanks rolling over the hill. This is Kuwait in 1990, and though the people there don't know it yet, Saddam Hussein's Iraq has just invaded. The film is one of the most realistically shot and detailed big budget human dramas we have seen in Bollywood. Even though the plot is one dimensional, there are multiple subplots that keep you engaged through the film. Raja Menon makes a honest effort to give the film a docu drama feel in the first half. A lot of work has gone into making Ras Al Khaimah look like Kuwait (which isn't that tough a task given the similar landscapes), but full marks to the research team for creating the period. Everything from the props to the clothes to the visuals remind you of the 90?s when the attack happened. Menon inserts the right dose of wry humor and a few shocks along the way to build his film up gradually, hitting the right buttons for most of the time. When we first meet Ranjit, he is not yet in the mold of Oskar Schindler, the German businessman who saved the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories (and was the subject of a contested Steven Spielberg biopic), but he is getting there. Practical to a fault and a superb negotiator, Ranjit describes himself as a Kuwaiti rather than an Indian, and has mild contempt for the country he has long left behind. But Ranjit's entrepreneurial skills come handy when Saddam Hussein orders his soldiers and tanks into the kingdom. The invasion puts the lives of several hundred thousand Indians of all classes in jeopardy, and reluctant Ranjit is transformed into a most enthusiastic messiah. He relocates his stricken fellow nationals to a refugee camp and takes on the delicate task of persuading a grubby-handed Iraqi general (Inaamulhaq) and the Indian government - represented, again, by a single caring bureaucrat (Kumud Mishra) - that these lives are worth saving. The general has already offered to protect Ranjit's wife Amrita (Nimrat Kaur) and his daughter in exchange for money. The film works very well if the paying public is willing to forget the actual facts of the operation. The smart screenplay, by Raja Menon, Suresh Nair, Ritesh Shah and Rahul Nangia, deftly lays out the characters of Ranjit and his initially reluctant wife, who cannot understand her husband's sudden turn towards charity, and resists the temptation to fast-forward to the inevitably rousing nationalistic climax. The rescue operation follows a long and vexing attempt to shake the Indian government into action. The frustrations and false victories are explored at length, as if to remind viewers that in real life, rescue operations are far more mundane than the movies lead us to believe. Menon credibly creates a sense of a nation at war, and the decidedly non-flamboyant writing creates a convincing arc for Ranjit's character to evolve from pragmatist to a super-hero. As sometimes happens when the overall picture is agreeable, little blips register more than they normally would. Prakash Belawadi is a welcome sardonic screen presence, but the needling character he's playing has no real purpose beyond making Katyal seem even more like a saint. Inaamulhaq's Iraqi major is a few beats away from Austin Powers. The songs, few as they are, have no business being there. That's about it, though. This is how it ought to be more often-a mainstream movie with a list of grouses you can list on the fingers of one hand. Not to mention that this is a film destined to end with flag-waving (literal flag-waving, as it turns out) but one that is nonetheless shot through with a healthy dose of skepticism. Nimrat Kaur provides a very fine performance. Among the supporting cast, Purab Kohli & Kumud Mishra stand out. In a genre dominated by seasoned directors like Shoojit Sircar, Neeraj Pandey and Sriram Raghavan, Raja Menon manages to carve out a niche for himself by narrating the story from Ranjit Katyal's point of view and inducing subtle themes of patriotism and dark humor which deliver enough punches to keep the story board ticking. On the whole, 'Airlift' is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is a commendable and laudable effort which deserves to be seen by all Indians on the occasion of Republic Day. It is made with humanity to tell a human story which could have turned out to be a tragedy. A few brave souls saved the lives of 170,000 people and it's time more Indian directors started telling stories like this which tells Indian stories a midst a global scenario. If you are in the mood to be entertained, watch Airlift. If you are in the mood to be educated, watch Airlift. If you are in a patriotic mood, watch Airlift. You know what? Just watch Airlift. You're not going to regret it.",
