Though slow paced, the scenery of southern Chile is remarkable, and though it seems that only one song is played, the way it's performed at various moments, especially at the finale, is remarkable. Jorge Garcia did an excellent job portraying the damaged protagonist who does get his last laugh.",

There are a few scenes that are a bit obvious, which lowered it for me, creating links that were already obvious (like showing the childhood passport to link the present day Memo to the child Memo), but I loved the quiet introversion of the film, a joy to watch.",

Also, the story unfolds gradually, everything seems so sleepy at the start, until you realize towards the end the emotions that rage inside. I loved the main character, his pain and his ability to overcome. There is a wonderfully satisfying feeling of justice being done at the end, and the song will mesmerize and haunt you for a long time.",

The only thing good that one can say about this movie is that the acting of Jorge Garcia was well-done, not brilliant, but reasonable.",
