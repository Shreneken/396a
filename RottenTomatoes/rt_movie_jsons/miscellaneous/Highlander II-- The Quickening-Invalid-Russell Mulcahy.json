            "content": "I saw the 2004 version, which apparently has updated special effects and is much more coherent and than the 1991 theatrical version. I went in fresh, not having seen the first Highlander, and unaware of this movie's reputation as one of the worst movies ever made (although I had somehow known through osmosis this movie isn't very highly regarded). I was pretty much lost during the first act, and I wasn't sure if that was due to having not seen the first movie, or if the narrative was genuinely confusing. Either way, a movie should orient you in the world and be able to stand on its own. I had trouble understanding the timeline, whether the Highlanders were from the past or some fantasy realm (turns out both), and what was the villain, Katana's, motivation. The world building was pretty flimsy as well. The Highlanders' world didn't feel lived-in, and the practicalities of living on an Earth without sunlight are hardly explored. Virginia Madsen's character grapples with the film's internal logic involving immortality, and her confusion basically mirrored mine. If the characters don't understand it, how can we the audience?\n\nHaving said that, I didn't think this was such a bad movie. I thought a lot of the shots were inventive, such as the wide shot of Katana walking through the Shield corporation's headquarters, and the rotating camera as Virginia Madsen climbed a spiral staircase. A shot of the city clearly involved heavy equipment to move the camera as this was made in the days before CGI. The premise and setting are at least creative, if underdeveloped. It is hard to hate a movie that is clearly trying, when there are plenty of other sequels that are cynical cash-grabs. Highlander II is basically a movie that tried and failed, which is probably why people find things to enjoy about it while marveling at its badness, while not exactly hating on it.\n\nAlthough, about halfway through, I noticed an odd thing happening: I found myself being entertained by its over-the-top action and dialogue. Highlander II is an odd and confusing movie, but it is certainly not one of the worst movies ever made.",

            "content": "After recently watching the first Highlander film (from 1986) and being filled with the Scottish spirit, I was excited to see where the series would go. I had heard from many sources that Highlander 2: The Quickening was a huge let down from the original and that it was, in fact, a horrible film. But I always brushed those comments aside because I usually enjoy a good, brainless, fun action film from the '80s and '90s. I didn't get my hopes up at all though since I saw the 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes but I thought maybe it might still be at least somewhat enjoyable. How wrong I was. Not only is this film terribly made from almost all perspectives, it's not even enjoyable to watch in the slightest. The film is filled to the brim with \"comedic\" scenes that just made the film seem overly stupid and the overall feel of these little scenes did not work well at all with anything else in the film. It even makes the film seem a little cliche and out of date today since many of the later '90s action flicks also incorporated this awful, non-fitting, non-funny, off-beat comedic relief such as Judge Dredd in '95 and Demolition Man in '93 among others. The movie's biggest problem though is its infamous multiple plotlines that barely go together at all, most of which are just forgotten and never resolved or mentioned again, almost as if the only purpose of starting that plotline was to get a fight scene or a \"funny\" moment that just throws the pace of the film off. But, these multiple plotlines don't just make the film nearly 2 hours, they make the film incomprehensible. Nothing makes sense in this film, and while there are many things that don't make sense in the '86 film, at least that one resolved its plotlines and had a unique charm, which I will get to later. Sean Connery's character was completely decapitated in the first film just to pop up randomly in this one without any explanation. The entire time travel plotline was completely ripped from Cameron's '84 masterpiece The Terminator down to the imagery and shot framing that was used. The terrible plotlines also lead to many consistency errors that would take all day to list. The plotlines just make a massive blob and mess of a film that clearly was just a bunch of people throwing whatever ideas first came to mind into the script. The main plotline isn't even interesting or intriguing at all (this is the ridiculous ozone layer plotline for those who can't tell due to the hundreds of plotlines in this film). I just felt that with all these plots, there was so much that could have been cut out to shorten the runtime and just make the film easier to follow and more enjoyable to watch. I kept catching myself saying \"that could be cut out\" which doesn't lead to a good film. Some smaller problems with the film would be that in some scenes the music didn't fit at all, especially the runaway train scene. The set was very generic-looking for an '80s-'90s sci-fi dystopian film and compared to some others, like '90's Total Recall, looks bland and boring. The costumes were also very bulky and ridiculous and I would expect that from a film like this from this time but this was especially bad. Some of the editing was also very awkward and terribly structured. There were way too many cuts in certain scenes, specifically the runaway train scene, and in some of the fighting sequences the actors were out of frame preventing the audience from seeing the action. Also, there were way too many explosions. There seemed to be an explosion every two seconds and it just got very boring and annoying after a while. What makes this film especially bad is that it takes many of the mysterious things that made the '86 movie charming and interesting and just completely abuses them and takes their charm away. Another thing this movie lacks is the charm of the original. I missed the chemistry between Connery and Lambert, the bagpipe music (which makes an appearance in this film [The Quickening] and is, as said above, misused and doesn't fit entirely aside from reminding us of the good cinematography and images of Scotland in the '86 movie), the cinematography which was quite impressive for an '80s action film I must say, and just everything that made the first installment fun, interesting, and memorable. The acting was also not good especially from Ironside who seemed to be trying really hard to be an over-the-top Jack Nicholson (failing miserably, sadly). Lambert was ok in this film, he gives a much better performance in the '86 one and so does Connery. Connery was one of the few things I liked about this movie, he really did bring the mood up and the few scenes he shared with Lambert (and the suit tailoring scene) were fun and memorable, but other than that he seems to be completely wasted in this movie. The only other positive thing I have to say about this film is that in the opening sequence there was some good camera movement, sweeping across the opera house but again, it just seemed to drag on and extend the runtime. In a word, the best and shortest way to describe the horrendous waste of time that is Highlander 2: The Quickening is... messy.",

            "content": "Highlander 2: The Quickening is a name so ridiculous that it serves as a perfect metaphor for the film itself. I seen the original not so long ago, and while I wasn't blown away by it, I still found myself engaging with its characters and enjoying its occasionally wacky storyline. The follow up seems to go out of its way to ruin anything good about its predecessor, and forever taint whatever legacy it had. It starts off by retconning the origin of the Immortals, then reverses the ending of the first film, then introduces some corporate espionage plotline that feels like it was lifted from another terrible sci-fi flick and carelessly dropped into this one. The story is a spectacular mess, the characters have unconvincing motivations, the script is lazy and the acting ranges from bored Hayden Christensen to sugar rush Nicholas Cage. The film is so confused and disordered that every 20 minutes could well have been written and directed by a different person. The villains were my favourite element by far. Not because they're compelling or intimidating, but because of the sheer volume of scenery they get to chew. Michael Ironside, who know from the start that the movie was going to suck, takes every opportunity to bare his shiny teeth and mug to the camera, and I was laughing throughout pretty much all of his scenes. He's cartoonish to the extreme, and John C. McGinley, doing a weak Orson Welles impression, is not quite as silly, but occasionally gets pretty close. I can't say I was bored while watching it, and the movie does pass by very quickly, possibly because of how baffled I was by it all. At the end of the day, there's much, much worse out there, but it's still a film that nobody really wanted to be in, especially when it was re-written, and it's long been confined to the \u2018worst movies of all time' pile, where it more than deserves to be. If you're a \u2018so bad its good' afficionado, Highlander 2: The Quickening is an absolute must see.",

Later on the film states that all of the immortals who die on earth go back to a planet called ziest until they are killed on ziest and returned to earth, WTH!! This plot point was created I'm sure as a reason to bring Sean Connery character back for the sequel. Michael Ironside plays general katana. Ironside is mostly a good serviceable actor in most roles. But for this film he was completely wasted. I could sense that he was trying to channel Clancy Brown, the Kergan and the villain from the first film. But he came of as a moron and a clown. \n\n The filmmakers didn't understand that Connery's character was already dead at the start of the first film and that his story was being told in flash backs. The movie was so bad that during the zyst scenes you can see actors being tossed around by an fx crew hidden in the sand. pathetic!! This film has several versions and they all sucked!",

But this sequel, fails to entertain and it's a ridiculous, poorly made film that just doesn't satisfy. This sequel has been said that it ranks among one of the worst films ever made, well I have seen far worse than this, but nonetheless, it's pretty bad. Whatever you've enjoyed about the original is ruined due to a lacking script, poorly constructed action scenes and lack of any memorable moments. I am a big fan of the first film, and I was somewhat hoping that the reviews for the follow up were somewhat false, but they are pretty accurate in describing the film. What really makes this a pitiful sequel is the fact that it the potential of being so good, but the filmmakers just didn't seem to care at crafting a worthwhile follow up to a classic action film. This is just lazy filmmaking at its very worst, and the film is just tedious, incoherent, and pointless in the way that it handles its story and ideas. I had high hope for this one, but like everyone else, I was let down by the lack of good ideas, effective action and good performances. The original Highlander had great performances, a terrific concept and well executed action scenes, which is something that this follow up does not have. Don't expect anything this film, as it fails to entertain and it's a mess from start to finish. If only the filmmakers would have put much more effort into this film, maybe it would have been good; however it's a pointless, unnecessary film.",

He destroyed his own creation. What he did to Highlander is worse than what God did to Jesus, or what Abraham was about to do to Isaac. He had so many ideas, and they were all horrible. They destroyed everything set up by Highlander.\n If I went into Highlander 2 with high hopes, id be largely disappointed. If I had low ones, I'd automatically not like it. That caused conflict within me, thinking there'd be no possible way I could enjoy Highlander 2: The Quickening. The fact is, there is no way to enjoy it because it is so damaging. The only reason to watch it is to see how badly a film series can be damaged when the director has too many ideas and none that work. If you like Highlander you will NOT like this. It barely works as a standalone film.\nThe few positives are that there is good cinematography, a cool soundtrack and even thou the plot is terrible, the budget supplied a decent look of the future. But it would have made more sense to cut the budget in half, use one half to fund a sci fi movie and use the other half to supply a sword fighting fantasy like the first Highlander.\nAlso, while Michael Ironside tries to be The Terminator, John C. McGinley tries to be Charles Foster Kane and Virginia Madsen tries to be Brenda Wyatt, Christopher Lambert tries nothing more than to be The Highlander. \nAnd Sean Connery gave a decent performance in his small role, but Ramirez's resurrection is so damn impossible, even in a film about a magnetic shield protecting an atmosphere of a planet where aliens with intergalactic weapons fight to the death with mere swords. None of it made any sense.\nThe scene in which Louise Marcus summarizes the background of the immortals being on earth just perfectly shows how stupid the background of the subject is, which is illogical and stupid and could have had thousands of better alternatives. Even not knowing it would be better than living in a world where Connor Macleod is an exiled alien. I wish I could live in a universe where is film did not exist. I wish I did not watch it and was able to maintain the idea that The Highlander was just some kind of ancient immortal being, and now I cannot. None of this is Highlander! IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SWORDFIGHTING FANTASY! Highlander 2: The Quickening becomes a mainstream science fiction film with almost no sword fights and so little fun because of the physical darkness of the film, amongst other things.\nAnd the notion of the holy rule? The only rule is \"There can be only one\" I mean, come on!\nOne scene to point out it the Flying skateboard battle scene. For a film more than twice the budget of Highlander, the death sequence is so horribly executed and there are visible strings. How can something go THAT wrong?\nLastly, the pacing is ridiculously slow and it becomes utterly boring, so it's not hard to understand how little fun there is to be had.\n\nIf you haven't figured it out from such a scathing review, You are about as smart as Highlander 2: The Quickening, but it's the worst film ever made. I'm still up for checking out the 3rd Highlander, but Russell Mulcahy should have listened to the famous line from the first Highlander and never made a second. There can be only one.",

But..in the first movie, MacLeod meets Ramirez for the first time in Scotland. They don't know each other and they don't know why they're immortal. So let's pretend this was the plan all along, in the first movie, how did they forget they were a) friends and b) aliens? And somehow MacLeod went from an antiques dealer to a scientist. he created a blanket protecting Earth as the ozone layer died. Then we meet old MacLeod in 2025 and his voice is just hilarious. I don't know what Lambert was going for here but it sounds like he's spent the past 20 years getting kicked in the balls. Then Katana sends down porcupine haired goons with hoverboards and MacLeod becomes young again. And then MacLeod brings Ramirez back by shouting his name like Beetlejuice only for him to die again. See if someone shouted for The Kurgan and he came back and tore Michael Ironside's head off with his bare hands, that would have been cool but it didn't happen and the movie sucked.",

In the end, Connor MacLeod wins the tournament and claims the ultimate prize - which when the movie was successful presented a problem: How does one create a sequel out of that? The catchphrase is 'There can be only one' and at the end there literally is only one immortal left. The series had accidentally written itself into a hole. So how were the film-makers doing to get out of the hole? \r\n\r\nBy adding an entire planet of immortals of course, and resetting the whole tournament. A more logical solution would be to create a prequel that followed the story of another immortal (which the TV series did to some effect). By introducing an entire planet of immortals, this renders the entire 'There can be only one' premise pointless since it is not possible for there to only be one without destroying the planet. \r\n\r\nThe 'Renegade' cut removes all mention of the planet Zeist, which improves the movie significantly since now it is possible for there to be only one, but the shameless 'Blade Runner' lifts, and the fragmented sub-plot regarding the sun being obstructed remains. There is still the sudden appearance of Ramirez who was graphically and unquestionably slain in the last movie - which was clearly an excuse to bring Sean Connery back (which I suppose is not necessarily a bad thing). And they retain the scene where Ramirez is killed (again), along with the shoddy explanation of how he is able to raise a Bond-Villain ceiling fan (ironic considering this is Sean Connery). This is not to mention the poor love interest and the drama-lacking plot. \r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is the result of Hollywood wanting more money for a franchise that should never have had a sequel. A similar effect would be created by making a sequel to 'Hamlet' where the cast is resurrected by a wizard so that Hamlet can once again avenge his fathers death.",

I watched highlander first (a good film by the way) and then went onto this one, in the same Sunday afternoon sitting. It's as if the writers forgot what they put into the original so just made up the background story from scratch. It starts out ok; Macleod has used his \"prize\" to help the scientist of the world protect us from the sun after the depletion of the Ozone layer. Strangely he is old at the beginning of the film but it is soon explained he is only immortal when there are other immortals on the planet. This is not mentioned in the first film but you can just about accept it. Then we find out he is from space...yes, space.\nOkaaaaay.\nIt turns out that him and Ramirez are from another planet and were exiled to the planet earth at the same time. This is strange as in the first film it is implied that Ramirez has been around since 500 BC, 1000 years earlier than Macleod. Perhaps Ramirez accidently got transported back in time as well? A problem with light speed travel between planters I guess  :S\nIt is nice to see Ramirez brought back into this film. How he came back to life, I\u00e2(TM)m still not sure, but hey...It\u00e2(TM)s like magic. Macleod shouts his name during the quickening and hey presto, Ramirez appears in his homeland. Now, if you watched the first film, you might think that I mean Spain, as Ramirez is Spanish (although of course, we know he is an alien), however, in this film it turns out he is in fact Scottish. (This is actually more believable seeing as Sean Connery can only do a Scottish accent, but they might have tried making him Scottish from the beginning of the first film.)\nThis film is terrible, in fact so terrible, it\u00e2(TM)s almost enjoyable.  Watch it just for the laugh.",

The film links to the first movie, but at the same time totally disregards the plot and back story of the movie.  Let me explain.  In the first film part of the story is that MacLeod (Lambert) is killed in a battle between clans and suddenly comes back to life.  He was amazed, his clansmen were amazed.  He talks to his family and mentions knowing him his whole life implying he was born there.  He has no idea he is immortal until Ramirez (Connery) finds him and explains.   Yet in Highlander 2, MacLeod and Ramirez are rebel leaders on a distant planet hundreds of years ago.  The two of them are banished to the future to be immortals.  They know this, and throughout the movie reference it.  When bad guys come from the past to attack MacLeod they are transported whole, adult, and fully aware.  I won't even get into the totally illogical major plot line.\n \nThe acting was equally atrocious. Connery is his normal self and was the only one who played his character even somewhat well.  Although I would count it as one of his worst performances.  The special effects were terrible but that could just be due to the technology of the time the movie was made.  I tried to watch it with that in mind, but they still seemed bad even by those standards.\n \nWhile the characters in the movie seem to be able to move through time, I can not.  If I could, I would go back and take the movie out of my Netflix queue and saved two hours of my life and watched a, hopefully, better movie.  I give it a 2 / 10.",

            "content": "This movie is totally the most awesome thing ever!  What a mindblowing sequel!  It's got EVERYTHING!  This was one of my favorite films when I was a kid.  This AND the first one.  I fantasized every day about being an immortal highlander and chopping people's heads off with swords.  I took fencing in college mainly because of this film.  I LOVED THAT SHIT!  I got good at it too.  And there was even a black Vince in my class.  It was so fun sparring with him.  I loved stabbing him with the sword again and again and again, JAB! JAB! JAB!, going \"Give me back my name, dude!  That's MY name!  Die!\"  LOL, the good old days.\r\n\r\nNow I'd like to criticize the horrible criticism this film got from fans and critics alike.  Everyone had a big whiny fit about the Highlanders being from outer space.  Hell, if anything it just made it more interesting.  All sci-fi and shit!  That was GREAT!  And then the main story takes place way in the future (2024), and the filmmaker did something really creative by making the sky a swirling red nightmare!  Connor MacLeod won the prize at the end of the first one (just like Queen said he would), became mortal, and created this big shield around the earth to save humanity because the ozone layer was about to disappear.  That's killer!  And then freaky aliens from his home planet come back to kill him, which just ends up making him immortal again.  They're flying on razor sharp discs and metal winged hang-gliders!  It's the best sword fight ever!  I was in awe!  Now THAT'S entertainment.\r\n\r\nAnd everyone hated this movie so much because they changed the mythology.  So what, big deal?  I think you've got to be a pretty boring person to hate swordfights and the future being all totally killer.  The atmosphere is great in this, it kind of reminds me of the classic post-apocalypse film Hardware.  But anyways, the filmmakers listened to the critics, sadly, and made a third movie that pretends like this one never happened.  Which is a TOTAL COP-OUT.  Would've been OK if the third movie wasn't a big piece of shit!  And don't even get me started on the fourth movie.  Here's my review of Endgame - \"BAAAAAARF!!!!\"  The Quickening is probably the most exciting and action packed film in the series.  The original is of course a classic, and great, but it isn't as fucking killer as this one.  This has gotta be one of my favorite sequels of all time!  MAN, I LOVE IT!!\r\n\r\nAnd Sean Connery rules in this!  Remember that he was killed in the original in the 1500\u00e2(TM)s, so when he comes to the future it's a great fish-out-of-water story.  Virgina Madsen starts off great as a kick-ass eco-terrorist, but then quickly falls into the roll of the love interest.  Seems like most of the movie she's just there as a pretty, and slutty, sex toy.  Which is fine, because all heroes needed a hot love interest back in the day so they didn't look like complete fags.  But she just doesn\u00e2(TM)t do much.  And Michael Ironside is the best villain ever in this!  That actor has always been great at being an asshole.  Fun to watch him in ANYTHING!\r\n\r\nSo, all in all, critics - if you hate well-choreographed swordfights, awesome sci-fi future stuff, dark atmospheres, flying maniac killers, immortality and awesomeness, then, um, I don't know.  Stop being such a whiny bitch maybe?",

With the renegade version; the plot-holes, idiotic characterization and horrible acting take center stage. Highlander 2 is simply a bad movie, it can be edited to death and it would still suck balls. Down to the last detail, this is terrible, The futuristic backdrops makes Paul Verhoeven's science fiction movies seem authentic, Every single frame is a mess, from story to production. Now the cast; Michael Ironside the evil immortal here is an idiot, he's incompetent, lacks proper motivation (that would makes this compelling or interesting), does nothing remotely threating, leaves you wondering how did this moron exiled both MacLeod and Connery in the first place and actually referenced the whole \"no fighting on holy ground\" bit, he's a fucking alien why should he's care at all. on the opposite note; John \"Dr. Cox\" McGinley is entertaining as a very 80s businessmen type completed with greasy slick-back hair. Lambert and Madsen, yeah they suck and you can honestly see them leaving off their resumes. And Sean Connery, looks like he appeared in movie as bad as Zardoz, okay he's not in a red speedo or cowboy boots so that a plus.

This version is vastly different from the theatrical version that was panned on its release, removing the fact that immortals are aliens from another planet and other shit that was wrong with that cut. So as I review this, I decided not to take into fact what the critics have said simply cause what they all reviewed was a different version. Not to say the film is WAY different. Highlander 2, no matter what version, will never be a good film. This version however improves what was considered \"atrocious\" into a mediocre film, however you look at it. To start off, the film does have some cool action scenes, and I like some of the plot ideas, but I must say that some of the plot also sucks! It can be inconsistent and ridiculous. The beginning of the film even doesn't do a very good job of leading off from the first, it does a little but could do better. There is shit that is never explained, and we're supposed to accept it in our knowledge of the Highlander world, BULLSHIT! The acting was subpar too, Michael Ironside really went over the top a little while Christopher Lambert is mixed as always, not too bad but not very strong either. Sean Connery is fairly okay though. I liked some of the art direction too, but that also got spoiled by some cheap looking visual effects. So to sum it all up, I found some entertainment in two forms: enjoying parts for what it was, but mainly enjoying it as a mess of a film as its shear badness made me laugh at times. It had some potential ideas which really saves the film from being terrible or SURPRISINGLY even that bad , which I believe is thanks to the plot changes made by the Director's Cut, which is a saving grace that greatly improves the film, at least making it watchable and at the worst, quite mediocre. But bad things aside, as many as there were, I oddly enough enjoyed it in the end, the second half mainly though, first half was much weaker.",

But I can see why they changed the film up so much in the later versions.\r\nThe action and acting is believable but the ending climax is so long it destroys all sense of tension you may have had. 10%\r\n\r\nHighlander 2: The Renegade Version - definitely an improvement over the original. There is no planet Zeist for starters. But it's still not much of an improvement. It's like toy that has fallen in the mud and you just decided to clean it off a little bit. So there's no planet Zeist, big deal, that doesn't explain why Romirez is fascinated by a plane even though in one of the beginning scenes he's seen in a giant aircraft. 30%\r\n\r\nHighlander 2: The Special Edition -THIS FILM IS...pretty good actually. Yeah it's stupid and I can sit here and pick out so many plot holes you wouldn't believe. But surprisingly all of those plot holes can be filled with quite a bit of assumption. I know there's the golden rule \"if it's a film, show it\" but I've seen movies that insult our intelligence by explaining, in excruciatingly painful and forced dialog between characters. This movie requires you to have an analytical mind to see what it's doing. And if you don't, this film is a lot of fun either way. We got swords, magic, future, monolithic cyber punk business corporation with a shifty eyed villain. It's so generic but it's so much fun! I've never sat down and watched a movie interested 3 times in one day. You know how you get a song stuck in your head for hours? this is the first movie that was ever stuck in my head. I found it to be a blast, and I went in expecting to HATE this movie with the bottom of my stomach. So for being a great improvement over it's atrocious predecessors, trying it's best to make sure there are fewer plot holes in it. I have to give it a fresh rating. 70%",

The scriped to this film is rubbish one of  the worst i have seen next to alone in the dark this movie try to be another blade runner the acting was okay i can say that saved it from a zero the special effects are terrible most of the times its good other times its poor. Overall it is one of the worst film ever made maybe if this was a film that had nothing to do with highlander and aliens it could have been good but anyway stay away from this i do not even wont to think about recommend it.",

The whole Sci-Fi \"we needed the shield to protect us from UV, but now the Ozone has repaired itself\" thing was a great idea, but poorly connected and executed.  Part of that is because it's so old, and part because it's a B-rate movie.\npositives: The sword fighting was good, better than the first.  Some cool moments, couple good flashbacks.  Sean Connery was absolutely amazing, though I felt like he was underused (again).  Some pretty hilarious scenes with him in Scotland and trying to get with the times.

I think it helps that I have just watched the 'Renegade' version which adds about 10 minutes of previously unseen footage, and re-orders certain other sequences to leave you with a movie that makes a lot more sense.  Christopher Lambert plays the role with same woodiness, and the return of Sean Connery is both welcome and has it's tongue firmly placed in it's cheek.  If you thought the villain from the first movie was over-the-top, just wait until you see Michael Ironside ham it up as Katana!!!!

That said, in retrospect it's easy to understand its charm: the originality of the premise and the creation of this entire mythology from scratch is a welcome departure from the countless monster/vampire movies which came out at the time. Sure the whole thing was always silly, overblown and inherently flawed but people didn't care, they just wanted to see a bad French actor kick ass with a sword, pretending to be Scottish the entire time, heads being chopped off, references to Queen and lots of electricity.

When Connor McLoud, now an old man, kills another alien who has just been sent to earth, he is made immortal once again; and must use his abilities, along with help from Ramirez (who, apparently, Connor can bring back from the dead just by calling his name, which kind of makes you wonder why he took this long to do so), must battle an oppressive future government to save the world.

RICKY BOBBY SAID SO!\r\n\r\nThis movie is sooo bad, and I watched the Renegade version which is actually better. I'm not sure better is the word I should use....maybe I should have said won't-make-you-strangle-your-puppy-and-eat-feces, although I almost did. If you want a sample of how bad it is; in the original version the Immortals where really ALIENS FROM PLANET ZEIST! I swear to god this is the truth. In the newer version they're from the \"past\" (please don't make me explain). Just everything goes wrong with this movie, continuity, plot everything. I blame the producers who forced the director to make this piece of crap.\r\n\r\nI like how \"in the past\" where Connor and Ramirez are really from, thay all have names like Connor and Ramirez, got to love it. All the shots from the \"past\" look like recycled footage from Dune.\r\n\r\nI don't even want to tell you the plot. Really, I'm trying to protect you. I tried you guys...I really tried to watch it all the way through a second time for this review, but time is so precious in college and I could have spent that time getting punched in the face or sleeping, like I actually did. Maybe I could have done it but it would have been so unfulfilling and lacking in anything remotely rewarding.\r\n\r\nSean Connery reappears in the movie. Apparently, you can ressurect someone by shouting there name really loud during the quickening. They should do this everytime they die. The explanation for this is that the two are share a special bond and that Christopher Lambert wanted him back. Great script writing, really.\r\n\r\nIt's the worst film in the series. It gives no respect to the first film and just rapes everything and everyone associated with it.\r\n\r\nI think I laughed at the scene when Sean Connery re-appears but I think I was doing it manically and stripping naked, while lying in a pool of urine.\r\n\r\nPlease stay clear. If Sean Connery, the greates badass ever can't save it then there is no hope. When Michael Ironside, the man who spit out one of the dumbest lines from Starship Troopers with a straight face AND made it convinving can't help you, then re-think the film. I can stand its power now that I've endured so much, but anyone else who isn't a film nerd will surely descend into madness and be sent to the Arkham Asylum.\r\n\r\nI guess it deserves half a star becuase I can't reall rate it lower. I shouldn't do that anyway because the movie technically functions as a movie. Theres no reason to say anything more about this movie....except this...\r\n\r\nMost people have a full measure of life... and most people just watch it slowly drip away. But if you can summon it all up... at one time... in one place... you can accomplish something... horrible, so horrible. Like this movie.",

            "content": "Not so good as the first one..but still..\nIn August 1994, news broadcasts announce that the ozone layer is fading, and will be completely gone in a matter of months. In Africa, millions have perished from the effects of unfiltered sunlight. Among the dead is Connor MacLeod's wife, Brenda Wyatt MacLeod. Before dying, Brenda extracts a promise from Connor that he will solve the problem of the ozone layer.\n\nBy 1999, Connor has become the supervisor of a scientific team headed by Dr. Allan Neyman (Allan Rich), which is attempting to create an electromagnetic shield to cover the planet, and protect it from the Sun's radiation. The team succeeds, in effect giving Earth an artificial ozone layer. MacLeod and Neyman are proud to have saved humanity, and believe they will be remembered for a thousand years.\n\nUnfortunately, the shield has the side effect of condemning the planet to a state of constant night, a high average global temperature and high humidity. By 2024, the years of darkness have caused humanity to lose hope and fall into a decline. The Shield has fallen under the control of the Shield Corporation. The corporation's current chief executive, David Blake (John C. McGinley), is focused on profit, and is imposing fees for the corporation's services. A number of terrorist groups have begun trying to take down the Shield, among them Louise Marcus (Virginia Madsen), a former employee of the Shield Corporation.\n\nMeanwhile, Connor MacLeod, now a frail old man, expects to eventually die of natural causes. As he watches a performance of Wagner's G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, an image of Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez (Sean Connery) appears, and induces MacLeod to recall a forgotten event of his past. On the planet Zeist, a last meeting is held between the members of a rebellion against the rule of General Katana (Michael Ironside). The rebellion's leader, Ramirez, chooses \"a man of great destiny\" from among them-MacLeod-to carry out a mission against Katana. At this moment, Katana and his troops attack, crushing the rebellion. Katana orders his men to capture Ramirez and MacLeod alive, and kill the rest of the rebels. The two captives are put on trial by Zeist's priests, who sentence them to be exiled and reborn on the future in pursuit of \"The Prize.\" Winning the Prize gives the victor the choice to either grow old and die on future, or to return to his time. Katana is unsatisfied with their decision, but the sentence is executed, leading to the events of the original 1986 film.\n\nBack on 2024, Louise Marcus discovers that the ozone layer has in fact restored itself naturally, which means that the Shield is no longer needed. The Shield Corporation is aware of this development, but has chosen to hide it from the general public, in order to maintain its main source of profit. Meanwhile, on the past, General Katana decides that Connor cannot be allowed to return, and sends his Immortal henchmen Corda (Pete Antico) and Reno (Peter Bucossi) to kill him.\n\nLouise manages to reach Connor first, and asks for his help in taking down the Shield. To Louise's disappointment, she finds the passionate person she once admired has grown into a tired old man. MacLeod explains to Louise that he is dying, and expresses his disapproval of terrorism. Before Connor and Louise can finish their conversation, Corda and Reno attack. MacLeod manages to decapitate them both. Macleod then absorbs their energy during the Quickening and regains his youthful appearance. In the process, Connor summons Ramirez back to life.\n\nIn Glencoe, Scotland - the location of his death in the first Highlander film - Ramirez is revived. He finds himself on a theatrical stage during a performance of William Shakespeare's Hamlet. Meanwhile, Connor has found a new lover in Louise Marcus. He attempts unsuccessfully to explain to her the concepts of his immortality. Elsewhere, General Katana arrives in New York, the scene of The Gathering and begins wreaking havoc.\n\nBoth Ramirez and Katana soon adapt to their new environment. Ramirez's earring is apparently valuable enough to pay both for the new suit he acquires from the finest and oldest tailor's shop in Scotland, and for an airplane ticket to New York City. Katana finds New York much to his liking. After entertaining himself for a while, Katana manages to locate his old enemy, but their first encounter in centuries proves to be indecisive.\n\nSoon thereafter, Connor is contacted by Ramirez. The latter joins MacLeod and Louise in their plan to take down the Shield. Katana, expecting this, forges an uneasy alliance with David Blake. The conflict between the two sets of allies eventually leads to the deaths of Dr. Allan Neyman, Ramirez, David Blake and General Katana himself. MacLeod succeeds in taking down the Shield by using the combined energies of his final Quickening from General Katana. Louise sees the stars for the first time in her life. Connor then claims The Prize by returning to the past with Louise.",
