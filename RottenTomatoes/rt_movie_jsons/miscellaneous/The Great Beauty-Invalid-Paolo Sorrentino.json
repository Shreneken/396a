Paolo Sorrentino's The Great Beauty is the story of a man looking back on his life, the moments that defined that life and the people who shaped it, and wondering what could have been done differently.  It is stunningly shot (the opening montage is beautiful), intelligently written, and well-acted throughout.  There are a lot of characters to keep track of, but those who are willing to stick it out to the end will be rewarded with a thought-provoking movie experience.",

            "content": "This is very much an arty film, a bit like The Square. There are some nice instances of cinematography present. Some scenes are surprisingly quiet and the visual imagery sort of speaks for itself, in a sense. I liked the classical style/operatic music played at times. It did seem to be a bit pretentious and I think it's fair to say that some of the script is a little...quirky, shall I say. \n\nI reckon its about identity, self-identity and the identity of the area its set in (Rome, Italy). There is a seediness to some of it. The main characters are mostly middle-aged to elderly men, Italian men and I certainly didn't feel much in the way of empathy towards them, given some of what's talked about. It's somewhat thoughtful and I suppose it is a bit atmospheric. There's an interesting scene featuring a young-ish child, a girl all but attacking a large white sheet with a variety of different coloured paint, as if defending herself against it. It is not the most...clear or accessible film as such, I think its fair to say but its certainly not without any interesting aspects. There is a certain poignancy in the 2nd half of the film too, certainly towards the end of the film, although i won't go into any details so as not to spoil it for others. Some scenes are quite darkly lit, adding to the sombre sense it has.\n\nOverall, its certainly not a bad film but its not an especially great one as such, certainly from the get go. Its ok, with some pretty good moments but its not one of the most memorable films I've seen overall. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it as such but if you enjoy films of this type then its probably worth catching if its on TV, that sort of thing, otherwise perhaps not. I liked the end credits for the background shown while their on screen. I hope this helps.",

            "content": "\"The Great Beauty\" is the novel about nothing that Flaubert never wrote.\nThe protagonist is Rome: the baroque theater of high society's vacuity; the eccentric stage of aristocracy's decadence. An eternally decomposing and empty city like the characters who inhabit it, apathetic and indolent caricatures of snobby people wallowing in their hypocrisy.\nBut under the representation of the ungraceful Italian bourgeoisie and the opulent sadly funny parties they attend, there is a deeper and more universal thought: the fear of the inexorability of time and the nostalgia for a lost youth (and a lost beauty); the search for happiness and the preservation of sensibility.\nThe ephemerality of the sublime is the reason of Jep's crisis, who listlessly tries to escape from that vortex of decadence and self-pity to return to a more romantic vision of life, lost when he decided to become the \"king of the high life\".\n\"The Great Beauty\" is a twenty-first century \"capriccio\" in which the explicitly Proustian narrative structure is combined with whimsical and bizarre elements.\nA film, however, too often disorganized and artificial: an orgy of heterogeneous content that Sorrentino does not always wisely balance, getting lost in virtuosic camera movements and grotesque allegories that undermine the authenticity of the story.\nThe soundtrack helps to underline the ambiguous nature of the entire work through a mix of composite classic and pop pieces, the sacred and the profane, a constant in Sorrentino's cinema.\nThe ability to grasp the beauty that surrounds us unfortunately turns out to be a lie, a mere trick, because it is immediately destined to be contaminated by the ugliness of life and the frivolousness of the people we meet.\nBut if we manage to go beyond the squalor and we accept the deception, the ego death, we can finally reveal our purest emotions and be fascinated by \"the haggard, inconstant splashes of beauty\".",

In the span of five minutes run time you can find yourself frivolously laughing, deeply moved, and confused in a weirdly fun way. 8.5/10",

It's basically one big love letter to Rome. Showing off all the exquisite beauty it has to offer. This movie's just one big feast for the eyes - it's shot immaculately. The movie is almost like a meditative experience on life and death. The beauty of life along with all of its dark and light moments. \n\nDamn that was impressive how Jep stripped Stefania's ego down to size when she was trying to make herself seem more important than everyone else. He gave her a real good reality check that also came from the heart. Wow, that old Saint Maria was so fucking old lol! That has to be prosthetics because she looks like an ancient relic. That was hilarious how her feet dangled off the seat. \n\nExquisitely filmed. Filled with beautifully lavish imagery and cinematographically gorgeous.

We must make amends, immediately.\"\n\nIt's nice that they still make movies like this, so sumptuous and grand. Sorrentino gives a particularly ambitious take on a classic subject - the meaning in life, here represented by a particularly decadent group of individuals reveling in their status and wealth; when struck by a recollection of sincere emotion that cracks his armor of superficiality, Servillo's Jep (an author coasting off the reputation of his one book from decades earlier) is confronted with a sense of self-reflection and tries to find out if even those with little or no depth might have the potential for it, or if their existences can even be considered valid. In doing so, he travels the streets of Rome, meeting old friends and the new generation in the process, trying to separate the idealistic or pseudointellectual from the sincere (which some may find even the script has a hard time doing). The journey through the party scene is soaked in booze and meaningless sex, mostly people content with continuing to maintain their life of surface-level intrigue by sustaining each other's inflated sense of self-importance. These are the idols that Rome loves.\n\nIf there's a major criticism it has to be just how overstuffed the film feels at times, developing subplots to the point that it feels like we're being beat over the head with their importance and excessiveness (also, some surprsing reliance on CG for a film that really doesn't need to do so). The ruminations get a bit high and mighty for my own taste at times. But overall, I think the broad nature of Jep's experiences works in the film's favor, giving it the sense of a true journey of an experienced man, retreading his past experiences with a capable weariness while still retaining the potential to be surprised. (3.5/5)",

But for all that it may seem random, unfocused, incoherent, it came together for me during the end scenes. Their 'dolce vita' lifestyles make for long, joyous nights, but also nights of betrayal and self-destruction. For all the money, celebrity, power/position fame and or wealth brings, we're all tragic figures of some degree; we're all suffering. But we find ways to cope and keep going- family, friends, parties, drugs, lust, art. \nThe eternal bachelor night life works for Jep. He has not really succumbed to looking like a fool denying his age and living as if he's still a young(er) man. But he's a great character; full of charisma, style, and confidence in the person he has become. The film is also celebratory of Rome; the city as a character of sorts itself. Remarkably well cast and visually gorgeous, the film overcomes issues of being somewhat derivative in parts, some style over substance, and being overly long to the point of some tedium. 3.8 stars",

Our guide is Jep Gambardella, a journalist-cum-socialite who, shortly after his 65th birthday, realizes relentless pursuit with the high-life has amounted to nothing worthwhile. As we follow Jep on his journey of self-discovery as he desperately seeks a meaning for his existence, Sorrentino's disorientingly fluid camera motions and  weapons-grade beautiful photography have a lucid, dreamlike effect that seems to possess the whole film. This augments the superficial appeal of the lifestyle Jep spent so many years pursuing, and during the many illusory rooftop party sequences, you feel as lost as Jep does. Physically there, but in another dimension mentally. Truthfully, The Great Beauty doesn't have any strong narrative backbone. It is rather a series of generally deadpan vignettes. But you'll be so ensconced by the hypnotic, preternatural, startlingly, agonizingly beautiful imagery you're being subjected to that you won't care a damn. Rome has never look so lavish and yet so utterly hollow.",

But while Trainspotting was a film about lower class British heroin junkies, this film is about upper middle class Italian yuppies.  Both protagonists in both films have to try hard to break out of their chains in order to be free.\n\nFor Jep, his freedom requires him to abandon the fashionable nihilism of his youth.  Once a promising young novelist, Jep fell into a deep slumber of sorts, wasting away decades of his life in an endless parade of meaningless sex, meaningless parties, meaningless art and meaningless friends.  Now, on the precipice of old age, Jep starts to piece together the tragedies he tried to bury in his life: his failed love life, his failed career and his failing spirituality.\n\nThis is a kind of redemption story and a piercing critique of the state of Western culture in the 21st century.  Smart film lovers will appreciate the lavish imagery, the thought-provoking dialogue and the devilishly witty humor.",

Paolo Sorrentino's  \"The Great Beauty\" signals his return from the empty abyss of his venture into American Cinema. It also signals an interest far more reaching than simply the realm of the political. \n\nThe film charts a life long journalist, played with a charmingly sarcastic turn by Toni Servillo, who has carefully played his one successful novel into a full time career of partying and hanging out with Rome's literary elite. Just as Jeb turns 60 he receives news that his first -- and, perhaps only taste of true love, has died. Suddenly Jeb is thrust into a delayed mid-life crisis. His existential turn forces him to re-evaluate the ways in which he has spent his life. Is it as vacuous as it appears. Has he spent the bulk of his life going to parties and debating fellow wealthy intellectuals on issues that really do not matter to any of them. Is his desire of sex a sad replacement for love. He begins to realize that his friendships are invalid. In fact, it seems that these friendships are formed more of some misplaced importance on disagreements than shared experiences. His one true friend is the person he ascribes the least of his attentions. His other friend his is maid whom he pays more for her attention than her duties. \n\nJust as he starts to slip into the void of depression, an old drug-addled friend encourages him to mentor his way-ward daughter. Ramona seems to find Jep as entertaining and fun as annoying. The begin to form a friendship as Jep takes her with him on his nightly \"adventures\" in art shows, night clubs and the hidden pleasures and secret places within Rome. \n\nLike Ramona, we are spellbound by these explorations. Luca Bigazzi's masterful cinematography lends every experience all the beauty he can fit into the screen. It isn't hard to understand how Jep has been seduced into a life that has left him isolated, meaningless and lonely. But is it really? \n\nNo firm answer is ever given. And this is a major part of the film's magic. \n\nMany compare Sorrentino's beautiful film to Fellini. That comparison holds up, but if anything -- \"The Great Beauty\" aims to re-capture some of Rome's magic that Fellini originally captured. The difference is that there is a haunting feeling that Rome is slowly slipping away and what might be left is hidden deep beneath the ancient city -- a place to which only a select few still have access. \n\nIt is an epic, lush, erotic, beautifully tragic journey of a film. It often feels surreal, but this is reality. This is Jep's Rome -- we are just lucky enough to see it through his eyes for 3 hours. \n\nA must-see film.",

(The pretentiousness of art topic is examined with great hilarity in the scenes with the viaduct-head-butting performance artist - for me, the best passage of the movie.  Quite ironic then that the movie also veers into pretentiousness from time to time).\n\nHowever, for all its good intentions and deeper meanings, the movie is quite uneven.  There are scenes and moments of great profundity, emotion and/or humour, followed by scenes that add nothing and just seem to drag the story out.

It does require some perseverance though...\n\nDespite being far from perfect, The Great Beauty won Best Foreign Language Film at the 2014 Oscars.

Gambardella preferred to gamble his lifestyle instead in the world of lavish parties, beautiful women, and daring adventures. Let's just say that Gambardella is no geriatric Cinderella. This premise of him living the aforementioned lifestyle instead of focusing on his writing artistry is beated on by a dead horse so much by Sorrentino, that it made me transcend to a great boredom mode. Now, I must say that the film's cinematography is tops. it is a love letter to Rome. But that is all I really found beauty in \"The Great Beauty:, but what a beauty it was. Servillo's performance was fair but not great. So \"The Great Beauty\" is not a totally ugly movie, but I have done, I mean seen better. \n*** Average",

If you enjoy Fellini, then you'll enjoy this one since it is constructed in the same vein with similar themes.  It lacks originality in that regard.  Toni Servillo holds the movie together with his portrayal of the writer Jep who upon his 65th birthday begins to search for great beauty in life, something more substantial  than the decadent lifestyle he's been living.  Jep is sad and resigned, insightful yet flawed.  Servillo's ability to embody all of these characteristics is so natural.  The film though stutters and starts throughout and ends rather anti-climatically.",

            "content": "A masterpiece in every sense of the word, The Great Beauty is pure and passionate cinematic poetry about the transcendent and fleeting nature of beauty found in a dying world. Director Sorrentino's gaze glides fluently, deliberately, from frame to frame to the volatile rhythm of life--electrifying party sequences set to hypnotic club music compliment moments of profound contemplative stillness overlayed with religious choirs and elegant strings. Amidst the dissonance, Sorrentino's camera remains in constant motion, following over the course of several days the meanderings of an upper class man on the brink of despair, searching for meaning as an old man with a misspent past. Sorrentino is able to express emotion and meaning in single images and scenes than most filmmakers are able to express in entire films. It's true that moments of beauty pass us by often without us realizing their significance, but The Great Beauty won't suffer the same fate. It is destined for classic status, and will be remembered for decades to come as a sterling addition to Italy's cinematic heritage.",

Pompous, but ultimately challenging, this piece of guilty cinematographic pleasure might be a tad slower and hard to chew for the mainstream movie-goers, but those seeking to experience La Dolce Vita of 21st Century  would surely be delighted. \n\nThe movie starts at the 65th birthday party of the ageing journalist Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo). Legendary with his one and only novel, famous for his bohemian and lavish lifestyle, Jep has always been the heart and the soul of the Rome literature and culture elite. After experiencing a shock, Jep starts taking a look at his life, his friends, his social circle and the extravagant life of his contemporaries in Rome; a look that develops slowly into a personal exploration of the beauty of all that he has lived through and the beauty of the things which he had missed due to his lifestyle. \n\nIf we have to be honest, the first thirty minutes of The Great Beauty would probably bore many of the viewers. Some might raise their eyebrows at the surrealistic beginning and will be wondering what is so special about Paolo Sorrentino's movie that it got him an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Movie. That is where the beauty of his movie is hidden. After the overlong introduction a sensual story gets in development. A journey of emotions, visual concepts and a bouquet of emotions, The Great Beauty not only depicts a society soaked in a provocative extravaganza, but also enthralls with the mesmerizing dialogues of the characters, sitting in the middle of a rooftop summer garden and the thrilling monologues of Jep. Speaking of Jep, it should be pointed out that Toni Servillo's performance is outrageously good! His biggest moments of brilliance are his monologues when he wakes up from his melancholic and philosophical state of observing life and everything around him. \n\nIn conclusion, many should be aware that The Great Beauty is not a movie for everyone. Slow, demanding, with problems of its own, it will please lovers of European cinema while it will be considered unbearably boring by the rest. A movie that could",

Whoever said that this movie was about style over substance did not pay attention to detail. \nAt some point of the movie, you will have two extremely unlikely characters with nothing in common but true sentiment: one worldly sinner that clearly feels the purest form of melancholic love and the saint who feels a deep sentiment through devotion and sacrifice. What can a nun tell an hedonistic and witty man that rid him from all the haze impeding him to find the root of his meaning in life? \nI thought that was genius.

            "content": "Jep's Journey for the Great Strange - An Unconventional Theory\n\nJep is a man in a time warp, standing still. He lingers, long after he should have gone on. In his youth he wrote a book, and it was great. He was lauded and given opportunity. He took this opportunity and he squandered it. He became, instead of an influential literary nationalist capable of imparting meaning to the living, an exceptional near-royal socialite who is empty and devoid of purpose and fulfillment. The only satisfaction he feels, the indulgence of man's carnal hungers and thralls, has grown old - as he has grown old - the contentment it brings is temporary, and barely that. He is the heart and soul of every party, but master of none that inspire or matter; his politics are that of the forgotten, and his life is akin to the deceased. \n\nJep lives in a land of exorbitant luxury and make-believe. He hosts Rome's most extravagant soirees, and is invited to all the rest. He drifts from day to day, drinking until dawn, and sleeping until noon. He does what he wants, when he wants, to whom he wants - yet he is not happy. He feels \"strange\" he tells his rascally caretaker as she prepares his daily meals. Most men would feel wonderful, they would feel alive, but most would not have lived the repetitively decadent life Jep has for the past four decades. While there are multitudes of other, better things our hero could do than sit around feeling sorry for himself, the point is well taken. He and his contemporaries have much more behind them than out ahead, and there are regrets. With all the opportunity they had - the money and the connections - and everything at their disposal - they could have done fantastic things, especially working together, and instead they have pilfered the well of the wasted, and now they lie. \n\nJep searches for the great beauty of his life - of all life - and of Rome, but he never finds either, left to ponder its eternal existence. The story unfolds in soliloquies that drop hints to what the great beauty that seems to elude the films central character actually entails. We believe it may be his first love, whom he lost his virginity to in a beautiful picturesque setting on the shores of lapping waves, atop a rocky pier below a phallic light house. But this is distraction, as is much of the movie; as misdirecting and diverting as all of the daily events in Jep's life are - the maniacal parties, the dancing women and stripping whores and booze-laden menageries of buxom fun and bedazzlement that is his existence. For example, the rippling water adorning the ceiling above Jep's sleeping abode - when one sees what they want to see, it is rare to find what one truly seeks. This is a lesson taught well by The Great Beauty.\n\nAfter casual sex with a random beautiful woman, Jep is offered the chance to bear witness to nude photographs that she has taken of herself. He feigns interest, and as she saunters off to get them, he quickly dresses and leaves, never to see her again. Next, an attractive couple at a party offer to make love for him as entertainment, inviting him to join if he so desires; but try as he might, this primal excitement has sunk below his threshold for enjoyment. He remains bored, and moves off again in search of that which he once had, and lost. \n\nWhile the film offers the viewer imaginative perspectives of glorious landscapes and architecture, the characters and dialogue contradict that which our eyes see. The ears, if properly tuned, will hear the next nugget of clue to the lost beauty of Jep's journey that surfaces: Rome herself. And has she lost what she once was as well? Just as Jep has? Is she no longer the inspired land of art and culture, and national pride that she once was? Have the youth missed the morals of the past and been deceived by the present to seek their fortunes and futures on foreign soils? Has entertainment and technology buried the living with the dead? These questions and more are posed throughout multiple nostalgic conversations on Rome, then and now. No honest answers are perceived through the fourth wall, but the characters certainly make their beliefs known within the microcosm of their lavish worlds; as if they each had the keys to the ancient unknown, and all because they are trustworthy and noble socialites. \n\nToward the latter half of the story, we are treated to a strange tale within a tale, one told of religion and lies - truths and roots. A strange old woman, proclaimed a Saint, is introduced and interferes with the usual unfolding of Jep's gatherings. She does things her way, asserting power over the empowered, bearing title over the entitled, and bolding the pettiness of all that Jep and friends pretend is not. She even sleeps on Jep's bedroom floor. He is powerless with her, and he is okay with that. Unbeknownst to him, it helps him grow, but not enough. Never enough, such is his life.\n\nThe Saint has a strict diet - she eats only plant roots. At first, all assume it is the meager meals of the deeply religious, but she explains to Jep - after making a strong point to inquire as to why he never wrote another book - that she eats roots because they are important. Jep cannot understand, for he has no roots. He struggles to grasp meaning in what he hears, and in contemplation he pushes himself out further than he has in the four decades since arriving in Rome. Yet, he does not wander far enough. He does not travel beyond Rome. He is stuck in his endless circle of broken ambition. While there is beauty all around him, he has been blinded by it, and can no longer recognize it. He can no longer see his place in the world. Without roots, Jep has no guidance to follow, no culture to call home, no love to nurture, no future to look forward to, and a past that has been so oversaturated with savor that it has turned dark in his belly and fills him with emptiness that lingers, just as he does. While death drains life all around him, he persists, strangely. \n\nIn the final shot of the film, Jep's journey floats smoothly through the waters of the city, looking here and there; a quest for something we now know he will never find. It's not his lover's lost beauty, nor love. Not Rome's lost splendor or grandeur. It's not even his own passing youth and virility. It is, instead, that spark of transcendental life that he has lost - that passion of ambition and drive to be more than you are - to grow and achieve levels higher than you ever had before. Jep seeks enlightenment and answers to the meaning of life. He's looked in all the wrong places, and by the very end of the story he is tragically no closer to finding it.",

Sure, the Fellini references are unmistakable -- with an eye for glamorous (and unglamorous) faces on an endless assortment of extras, usually engaged in some sort of Roman decadence.  And, in a role that could have been played by Mastroianni, Toni Servillo plays Jep Gambardella who (at 65) has seen it all.  Is he searching for something more meaningful, a spiritual answer, a long lost self (in love and a heralded writer), or has he decided to keep going with the flow?  True, the picture is spectacularly visual, showing us Rome's ancient art history and bits of its modern present, but it takes a lot of detours across its 142 minutes.  Servillo is a charismatic presence, taking it all in and sometimes dishing it out.  However, as with the work of Fellini, it is occasionally possible to lose the plot (what little there is) in the midst of all these cascading images.  Possibly, you have to be in the right mood for this one.",

Mash up Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\", Bergman's \"Wild Strawberries\", and Malick's \"Tree of Life\".

After seeing a movie like \"Amour\" win the Oscar for Best Foreign Film last year, I expected a lot more from this year's Oscar winner.  I believe that the film was well done.  Toni Servillo really bears his soul in this mosaic of Italian culture, and we truly get to see Rome from all angles.  I just didn't like the concept.  Everything seemed so disjointed and there were way too many extended dance party sequences.  I realize that this is the point, that the main character is surrounded by people and parties but feels alone, but I didn't enjoy watching it.  I had such high hopes during the vivid opening sequence with gorgeous impressionist choral music and then the film gave way to flashing lights and club music.  There was also a lot of unnecessary nudity that detracted from the visual beauty of the landscape sequences and the dialogue was often too fast to keep up with the subtitles.  Although it's easy to hate on this film, I'm glad that I experienced the scene where he humiliates that rude lady.  That was one of the best scenes of 2013 and, while I wouldn't recommend \"La grande bellezza,\" there are a few great moments hidden within.",

If the film is a metaphor for life -- and I think an argument could be made in favor of this -- those moments of great beauty are fleeting and far between as our life is overrun with chaos and worry and depression and oppression and other truly ugly human contributions.  Jep hasn't paid much attention but I think he shares that characteristic with many once one gets caught up in expectations and delusions.  As the film is in Italian and it clocks in at 2 hours and 20 minutes, I wouldn't expect many to go for this one -- the winner of the Best Foreign Language Oscar this year.

Even the lighting of all the scenes have something special in it. Something about that Rome daylight which gives the whole film look such BEAUTY. As the name suggest it really is a Great Beauty.

            "content": "The Great Beauty is a very deeply sensual representation of a 65 year old man Jep Gambardella and his life, expectations, repents and joys. Mysterious in a very dramatic and unfamiliar way this movie brings a great deal of art in one bag and let the viewer to explore Jep's illusions and realities through a mix of tastes and concepts. At times it seems like the story shatters and runs in all directions but it is like a fine cloth woven in separate pieces that comes to a whole in the hands of a master tailor. And no doubt it is one of the finest of contemporary cinema.\n\nJep (Toni Servillo) is an aging writer who has written one book read by many and bought respect 40 years back. Now he is living a comfortable life surrounded by his party hard aged circle of friends and writing columns in a prestigious newspaper. In a society influenced by connections and the rich and famous flocks with like minds Jep spends the majority of his day active at night. But after his 65th birthday he realizes that his life has being empty for some reason and a sudden encounter with someone that reminds him of his first love stirs his emotions and memories.\n\nAs mentioned earlier The Great Beauty is a jumble of many sorts of art. It has poems, songs, dances, performance arts as in stage plays and magic, Painting such as modern and renaissance and even sculpture. This many sorts of mixed arts bring in a very bizarre disposition to this movie and the cinematography is superior at each element. The other key player is music. You will hear many types of music one after the other and the emotional beauty is certainly enhanced in each level no doubt.  \n\nYou will get to see the Roman grandeur in perfect cinematic angles and explore some of the fine pieces of sculpture in candle light. And meet various characters of the society with taste of fashion dressed in fine clothing even in funerals. And the journey takes the viewer through vividly lit night clubs and lavishly furnished condominiums and roof tops of the fortunate. All these elements adds spice to Jep's lifestyle filled with witty and at the same time sarcastic dialogues.\n\n\nLeaving the technicalities aside the single most powerful strength of The Great Beauty is its beautiful script and representation of the plot. However it's like a two edged blade where some of you might completely agree and move with the flow while the rest might curse and leave the cinema hall for wasting their precious time. But the latter kind will be seldom as either your hooked or slipped within the first few minutes of the movie. If the journey looks promising you will find many goodies along the way.",

Luca Bigazzi's cinematography is ravishing, Toni Servillo is fantastic in the lead role, and the film asks some interesting questions, like does that \"great beauty\" disappear with age, or is it only then when we find it? There are also some unforgettable individual scenes; most notably the one where Servillo's character Jep is spending an evening with his friends, and verbally tears one of his lady friend's life to shreds. That scene has such tension and power it makes the viewer hope the film had more of it. As it is now, the film is less than the sum of its parts, too often wandering to fumbling, tedium and stagnation.",

            "content": "As it was the film awarded the 2013 Academy Award for Best Animated feature, The Great Beauty was a film that I simply had to see.\n\nThe Great Beauty wasn't exactly my favourite kind of film, but it was still an entertaining one.\nA film like The Great Beauty is an acquired taste, so its negative elements are largely its positive ones as well. Admittedly although I appreciated the film, I found myself torn between what my feelings towards it was though as a whole I certainly favoured it more.\nThe Great Beauty is a film different from many others because it doesn?t feature much of a direct narrative. It does feature a character which it follows closely over the course of the film and documents his experiences with finding beauty in the world of Italy and as he reflects about his life and his experiences. This is both the most positive asset of the film and most negative and will determine whether or not audiences approve of it. I was a little thrown off by it at times due to its consistently slow pace and lack of story direction, but at the same time found it to have gentle movement and a beautiful sense of mystery to it. The great mystery in The Great Beauty is the question of what The Great Beauty truly is, and director Paolo Sorrentino makes many suggestions with his film until viewers make the realisation that it is life itself that is the titular Great Beauty. It is a complicated journey that the film takes until viewers come to that realisation and many are likely to get thrown off by the pacing and the lack of actual dramatic events and the complicated plot structure which was commonly confusing for me, while others will appreciate its visual style and its overall message. My opinion rests in the middle but I see the film more favourably.\nThe Great Beauty wouldn't be my first choice for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature against other films such as Blue is the Warmest Colour, but it certainly has appeal. The way I experienced it, I was often confused by the complicated story structure of the film and half the time I couldn't determine whether Jep Gambardella was facing new experiences in his life or reflecting on old ones. The film felt like a series of vignettes more than a film with a direct narrative which sort of got in the way of me attempting to truly experience everything, and its length and pacing threw me off as well since The Great Beauty felt a lot longer than it needed to be and made the journey the whole way to the end a very slow one which occasionally made me fall out of the grip of the sequences.\nBut at the same time, I appreciated the complexities of what The Great Beauty was saying about Jep Gambardella as he came to terms with past, present and future and considered the loss he had experienced over the course of his 65 year lifespan. It told his story largely through a lot of notable imagery which captured the beautiful Italian scenery and the many artistic sights of it through some exquisite cinematography worthy of an Academy Award nomination for its excellence. The Great Beauty was a great beauty from a visual perspective and was a truly unforgettable visual experience which captured all of its immensely beautiful sights and stars with plenty of colour, so it goes to show the kind of artistic mind Paolo Sorrentino holds. The visual aspects of The Great Beauty manage to largely make up for its lack of comprehensible plot structure and the way the narrative indirectly linked everything, and it makes it quite a sight to behold.\nThe Great Beauty also benefits from a strong musical score which enhances the artistic mood of everything, as well as the talent of a skilful cast. They all benefit from an insightful screenplay by Paolo Sorrentino and Umberto Cotarello who manage to capture the artistic mood of all the situations and goes in depth with their well-written characters.\nThe lead performance of Toni Servillo is excellent. For most of the film he is very stoic and he lets his emotions be expressed simply through his facial gestures which he manages to articulate with ease. You can tell the whole time that he is in deep thought reflecting on everything that is happening and attempting to handle it all, and through his simple facial gestures he manages to tell a lot about his character. The deep emotional state of the character is a complex one and yet it is easy to sympathise for him and see into his soul through the simplicity of Toni Servillo's facial gestures and the line delivery of what few words he does in fact speak. His role is an effective one and with a captivating skill he manages to capture the complicated mindset of his character and face everything that comes with age and all that his character Jeb Gambardella has experienced over the course of his 65 year lifespan. There is a lot for audiences to take in from The Great Beauty, but Toni Servillo has already done that for his character and executes it with ease. Toni Servillo is a great lead in The Great Beauty, and he interacts with all the other cast members and the complicated style of the film very well and makes it all seem natural due to his easy skill at delivering the role.\n\nSo a lot of people are likely to view The Great Beauty as a love it or hate it experience, while my opinion lingers in the middle although I enjoyed it. While its lack of direct story may throw off viewers and the complicated structure of plot elements may do the same thing, The Great Beauty benefits immensely from the artistic mind of Paolo Sorrentino who makes it into an unforgettable visual experience which reveals the true beautiful nature of Italy.",

Basically this guy, who is a high society celebrity, goes around like the jaded film critic in the noir classic Laura, cynically belittling everyone with his satirical wit, but all the while looking, looking, looking (though not consciously) for some indefinable thing that he can't even name, but hopes will make him feel less hollow.  So his elaborate razor-sharp take-downs and the gorgeous imagery edited into the film (the Fellini connection, I guess) keeps the whole thing chugging nicely along, whether or not the plot is less than your basic Hollywood fixture. \n\nPeople he meets throughout the film give him a little shove now and then in the right direction, but mostly the film shows how life is hard and sorrowful even for people who are materially wealthy, \"successful\" and celebrated.  In the end they are all human which often seems to be a punishing condition.  The film delivers in its last scenes on the quality cited in the title, which I thought was awesome, and is shot in Rome, which just adds icing to the cake.",

If you are like me and feel that film art is dying a slow and painful death -- all you need do is sit and allow yourself to fall into Paolo Sorrentino's The Great Beauty and discover that not only is film art still alive, it is thriving. While this film is certainly intellectual, it also manages to be a sort of meditation on life, beauty, politics, aging and pure cinematic magic. Ignore synopsis and just see it. Stunning.",
