This time, as a middle-aged man, I understood it better (or, differently). It's a great movie - bursting with passion and totally authentic. The critical reviews are not all rosy, but I think it's because the critics do not relate to the material at a personal level. Those who do (even if only remotely), feel this movie in their hearts and follow it in their minds. As such, it is a masterpiece, because it touched the audience profoundly; for some, it even shaped their lives in some way. Perhaps, that's why the audience give it rave reviews. I absolutely love it.",

Benjamin Bratt was magnificent in all facets of his character, Paco, and though stiff in the beginning, Jesse Borrego finds his character, Cruz, halfway through the film and gives a spellbinding performance from then on out. The length I can look past, but it's hard not to think that had a better actor played Miklos this film would be much more recognized today, a true masterpiece. He was without a doubt the weakest link, which is kind of tough when he is in almost every scene, and he brought humor to scenes that weren't intended to be funny... like, at all. I dove into a Damian Chapa wormhole after watching this and checking BIBO on IMDB and damn... At least he's still fighting the good fight, I guess.",

            "content": "This is a great movie. I could spend a lot of time outlining the many topics it covers, but it touches on pretty much everything. Frankly, I understand why it was made during what I call the last moment in American media that was open to the truth, the early to mid 90s, when the 80s had been cast aside, and grunge music and films by minority directors re-assessing the kneejerk patriotism of the Reagan Bush 1 years proliferated.\n\nUnfortunately, by the new century, the media screws had been turned back in, and then 911 and the war on terror shut all truth down.\n\nThere might be some exaggeration in this film. I'm white and not an expert on the subject matter, but I was blown away by the humanism of this film. It does seem to follow a historical story line as well, for those that have researched any aspect of prison gang history in the USA, it is apparent here, though it doesn't quite announce it. I'm amazed this film passed me by, but then I'm not, because like most Americans, I just wanted to ignore what was happening in LA in the late 80s and 90s, it just seemed too horrific.\nWHile well familiar with Boyz in the Hood, I was not familiar with this film at all, and I know why, because there are other great films in film history that are deliberately sidelined, because they just tell too much truth about the USA, and this is one of those films.\n\nFrankly, I think its incredible. I had to see it on Youtube, I've never ever seen it aired on TV and I've seen just about every other film I love aired on TV at some point since th proliferation of channels. ANyone associated with this film should be very proud, including the writers, directors, and actors. Some larger roles for some familiar faces as well, and prison portrayal I would say fivals anything I've seen in it's authenticity.\n\nGripping. Actually affected and humanized my views of Latinos as well. Great work.",

            "content": "As the closing credit began rolling it's rather difficult to draw a final conclusion for \"Blood In Blood Out\" (or Bound By Honor). A film that's passes the three hour mark and one that has notable flaws during its long journey. It's an epic gangster film on a different ethnicity in a genre that is overpopulated by Jewish, Irish, or Italians. It's easy to appreciate it for exploring the rarely touched upon Los Angeles' Latino crime subculture, but doesn't share to its inspiration the heart, the scope, and craftsmanship. By the time the film ends it's neither a waste of time, but clearly no masterpiece it was aiming to be.\r\n\r\nBlood In Blood Out focuses on half-brothers Paco and Cruz, and their bi-racial cousin Miklo and how a violent crime and the influence of narcotics alter their lives. The film has three intertwining storylines that connect throughout the film, but also stand as their own individual storylines about redemption, failing to make a honest living, and disownment by family. As expected of a crime film revolving gang violence among youth the common themes are all here. Characters learning the meaning of home and family; hard but honest work versus a life of crime; the fickle consequences of youthful foolishness, striking down some while letting others pass; unfulfilled hopes, and other hopes fulfilled in unexpected ways; generational gaps bridged only by maturity that comes in the wake of mistakes; the constant questioning of oneself. That's allot of area it covers which in respect it does successfully by exploring those themes over time. The central focus is the brotherhood and the bond between the three central characters. Showing the consequences of their lifestyle that drove them apart. Feeling true to reality at times and not a work of fiction. Developing through time and growing into entirely different people for the better and worse. \r\n\r\nSadly where it missed the mark is showing the bond. It's one thing to say that family is connected, but it's another to show that in a creation of fiction. The main problem while experiencing \"Blood In Blood Out\" is no intended emotion towards the main characters is ever warrant by the viewer. We only spent a half an hour with our three central characters before their lives collapse which in that time does not justify what makes the bond strong. We neither get any reason of why we should sympathize for our main hero Miklo. Literally upon his introduction we're told he beat up his father and is violating his parole for doing so. This is in turn makes Miklo a plot device in the film. In order for its story to take shape Miklo must A.) Attack a rival gang, B.) Fully understand how the prison operate and the hierarchy criminal, and C.) Attempt to live without falling into his former lifestyle. These three events trigger the major plot points making it difficult to see the central hero anything else beside a tool to move the plot forward. The ending closes the film, but not the story. It closes no loose end defeating the purpose of it story was meant to have. Was it trying say there is no good people by choice, but only from past consequences? If not, then it message could be lost on the viewer.\r\n\r\nLead Damian Chapa is not as strong as his co-star to carry the film. He doesn't have the acting chops to be taken seriously when acting tough in prison where he comes out as a whimp. When Chapa is outside of prison his acting is improved being less energetic and more down to Earth, but not lead worthy caliber by any stretch. Granted Chapa appearance works in favor of the film theme on acceptance among your own people. Jesse Borrego and Benjamin Bratt are also major players in the film taking up an equal amount of screen time as the lead. Borrego and Bratt are convincing in their roles. They overplay their parts just enough it won't take away when the actors have to deliver dramatic scenes. Both actor performances won't garner an emotional attachment from the viewer, but they are solid enough to not take you out of the film. The huge supporting cast consisting of Billy Bob Thornton, Enrique Castillo, Victor Rivers, Carlos Carrasco, Delroy Lindo, among many more to name are excellent. The supporting cast at times outshine the three stars that carry the film. Selling the generic cheesy dialogue and archetypes they portray. In particular Enrique Castillo who despite getting a cliche prison character delivers his performance with a calm nature. His arcs is the closest the film gets to an emotional scene.\r\n\r\nBlood In Blood Out is a decent crime film that falls short of greatness it wanted to reach. It's three hours storytelling falls trap to its genre holding it back. It's not hard to see why the film is so widely loved even with it shortcomings. It hefty length allows the audience to connect with the characters, but the story itself is all too common for a crime epic to be anything more than decent.",
