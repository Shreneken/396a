This feels nothing like a home alone movie, yes the plot that hasn't been changed since Home Alone 2 were Kevin is alone in New York, and it goes back to the bland plot of Home alone 1,3,4.

Rehashing all the tropes with none of the substance and made even worse by the fact that our protagonist is an insufferable prick and the \"villains\" have a very sympathetic motive that just makes their alleged comeuppance feel horrifying or depressing. It maybe would've worked better had their motives been a plot twist but, thanks to fourth wall myopia, I'm instead baffled why Disney wants me to laugh at these antics. At least it was nice to see Buzz again, though. I would rather sit through the atrocious Buck Wild movie a second time than see this Christmas \"treat\" that will make anybody on Santa's naughty list wish they got coal.",

            "content": "I remember watching the original Home Alone in theaters as a kid. I don't think anyone thought at the time Home Alone would begin a franchise that would last so long. I think the  great writing of John Hughes has a lot to do with this. Home Sweet Home Alone tries to capture the same magic as Home Alone, and lacks a few things that made the original special. The story here is fresh and needs a little improvement. The characters are original and are not as interesting as the first Home Alone. A few simple changes would go a very long way.\n\n\n\nThe story is interesting and simple, which I really like. Max is left home alone after his entire family leaves for the holidays. The house, of course, is chaotic, since it's filled with so many people, and the family is in a rush to leave. Pam and Jeff are a married couple who live close by and are in a bad financial situation after Jeff lost his job earlier in the year. While trying to sell their house before they lose it, Jeff realized that one of his old family dolls is worth a lot of money, like $200,000. Only the doll has gone missing during an open house, and he has to steal it back. I like the premise. The details I don't like. Home Sweet Home Alone is not going to become a Christmas classic like the original, however, this movie is not nearly as bad as everyone says it is.\n\n\n\nThe biggest problem of the story happens at the very beginning of the movie. Max and his mom are driving home and Max needs to use a bathroom\u2026 like, now. So his mom stops at an open house, because, I guess that's what you do when you have to go. After a brief introduction of our soon to be thieves and a brief altercation between Max and Jeff, we're left with the impression that Max stole a very rare and valuable doll. This immediately turns Max into the bad guy of the movie, when he really should be the hero. \n\n\n\nAlthough Home Sweet Home Alone is a very funny movie, the premise isn't that good. Really, the story is disappointing. A couple who had their doll stolen is trying to steal back a doll that belongs to them. The bad guys are really the victims in the story. A better idea would be to keep them as bad guys by stealing a doll that belongs to the boy who is left home alone.\n\n\n\nMy storyline would go something like this. The Max's family is having an open house. The thieves attend the open house looking for things to steal and find a doll that they know is worth a lot of money. Overhearing a conversation, they learn the home owners are going away for Christmas and plan on coming back after they leave. Then when the thieves come back, they encounter Max left home alone. This way, the bad guys are bad guys and the boy is the hero.\n\n\n\nAnother thing I would change is how bratty Max is. The kid is a real spoiled brat. He doesn't come across as likable at all. Kevin, from the original Home Alone, wasn't a perfect saint. And he was at least likable. I'm sure the filmmakers were trying to get some cheap laughs by having a smart alec boy mouthing off. However, this doesn't really work. Max shouldn't be a brat. We need to want him to be a hero in the story for this to work. Max really needs some discipline from his father.\n\n\n\nWhich reminds me\u2026 where is his father? Max talks about his parents all the time in the movie, and we never see the dad. Just the mom\u2026 and, well, we see a lot of people around the house in the beginning. The house is so full of people that Max feels the need to hide in the BMW parked in the garage to get some peace and quiet. And we have no idea who these people are. Just that all of them are on their way overseas for the holidays. Some have English accents. Some have American accents\u2026 no idea what the relation is between everyone. A couple of quick scenes at the beginning to introduce everyone would clear this up. \n\n\n\nChris Mann writes reviews for movies streaming online.\nGet an expert's review.

The original Home Alone was poorly paced and the second one was too murderously violent for a kid's movie. This one forging a new path where there are jokes peppered into the exposition, the robbers aren't outright villains, their motives are understandable enough to kids and the violence is more cartoonish just makes this a more finely-tuned kids movie than any of its predecessors, at least the theatrically released ones. Sure, some of the dialogue was bad and I didn't much care for Buzz's cameo, but I thought the plot mechanics that kept the kid at home by himself were more believable than the original had been, where the mom has a serious argument with Macaulay and then forgets it completely by the next morning. The slapstick was creative and the boy was charismatic. I will note that my highly positive viewing experience was likely skewed upward by the absolute best fart joke I have ever seen in a movie. I'm not normally a fan of scatalogical humor, but oh my goodness, I was wheezing for a solid 5 minutes at the toot scene and as soon as my 8-year-old came home I had to pull the movie back up to show him. This was a real classic for me!",

She demanded to watch all of them- getting through 3 was slightly painful, 4 was an absolute train wreck so we were not looking forward to sitting through this one either. But we were laughing (genuinely) the whole time. Our daughter yes was confused and wanted a genuine bad guy but honestly the plot was refreshing and different enough to not just be another rehash. There were no real bad guys just a big misunderstanding followed by the obvious ensuing hijinks. We enjoyed it more than our daughter, even though she got the traps she craved so she liked it too, but for what it was it was great and would absolutely recommend.",

I loved it, and the (entirely predictable but brilliant) \u2018Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' that followed. Both written by the 80's legend John Hughes. I've re-watched both many times, and was highly sceptical of this new edition. Every sequel there has been since the first two films has been terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised with this!\n\nI think the acting is great, and the motivations of all individuals is largely logical (granted, at points that is a stretch). It's no more absurd than the original two (perhaps at points less so).\n\nI was surprised it was still almost as jovially violent as the original, which added to the enjoyment - and there were many moments that made me laugh out loud. There is also some disguised adult humour, which I won't spoil by quoting here, particularly with the Smart-device in the home.\n\nGreat cameo from the actor who played Kevin's brother Buzz in the original too - and this wasn't just a nod, it actually significantly added to the panning out of the plot.\n\nI'd recommend this film to all ages \ud83d\ude0a",

The ending doesn't even make sense and leaves the viewer extremely unsatisfied. I've read the 5 stars reviews and they claim that this movie is good because people are comparing it to the original film. Even if you don't compare this to the original the movie is still trash. If I was able to rate this 0 stars I would, but I can't so I give it a 1/5. Now I will rant about everything that is wrong with this film. The main characters family make me want to jump off a bridge into shark infested waters. When I saw them on the plane I literally saw a little devil on my left shoulder telling me to pray for their plane to crash in the pacific ocean. Then the angel appeared on my right and agreed. There is also no central character building in any portion of the film. There are absolutely no consequences for anyone's actions. The boy is a bratty little prick at the end, then craps himself when he realizes he doesn't know how to use a microwave and cry's for mommy.

All in all this is the worst movie I've ever been forced to watch. Even if the \"robbers\" were robber I would have rooted for them to take everything, burn down the house and leave the kid in the cold of winter. This movie makes the emoji movie look like a cinematic masterpiece.",

It is difficult for the audience to tell what traps were set up and how they worked. Also, the motive for breaking into Max's house was borderline absurd compared to a robbery (which was the motive in the original movie). Why not just talk it out to resolve the misunderstanding? The couple just simply thought that Max stole their antique doll and want it back. These people don't have evil intentions, and just try to talk it out with Max. Why are they met with painful \"traps?\" Perhaps, if criminals tried to steal from a house, these traps would be more suitable.",

It seems like one of the last things you'd think of making for a Christmas movie, much less a Home Alone type movie. The \"pranks\" try to be comical with the physics but some of them contrast that by being incredibly violent, beyond pg-movie reasoning.

The only funny joke was when a character was self aware and made fun of movie remakes. Some scenes look like they're filmed on a phone, and with all these obvious and tacky product placement, they might as well be.\n\nMoving on from the actual film itself, the characters are HORRID. The little 10 year old protagonist is a jerk, and nothing about him is likeable. From this point forward I would put a spoiler warning, but who in their right mind would actually care about a spoiler for this movie? Anyway, he steals an heirloom doll from a family and hides it away in his mansion. This family is struggling to afford their current house, and decide to sell that doll for a lot on eBay to be able to support themselves financially. In their attempts to get into the house to get the doll back, the parents of that family become the classic Home Alone Robbers\u2122. In the end, it turns out the parents' nephew hid the doll away, and all the assault and injuries were for nothing. Long story short, some bratty British kid beats up some people because they're trying to take back what's rightfully theirs. The parents aren't all in the good either, they planned on selling their house but never told their kids about it until they had to explain why they broke into a child's house.\n\nThe main difference that makes these characters so unlikeable is that compared to the original Home Alone movies, barely any actions were justified. The British kid (can't bother to remember his name) is a greedy privileged brat who feels no remorse when it comes to stealing a water gun, compared to Kevin who names himself a criminal after stealing a toothbrush. While both these kids attacked the robbers with house traps, the difference is that one pair of robbers has the intent to steal all the valuables from a house a kill a kid, while the other robbers are just trying to retrieve a family heirloom.\n\nTL;DR: Home Sweet Home Alone was so terrible that I was driven to make a Rotten Tomatoes account. Everything from the characters to the camera angles are tacky. The only funny parts were the times when I laughed at how dumb it was. I would only recommend watching if you like making fun of movies with your friends.",

They get put in a position where they have no choice but to sell their home but realize that a creepy doll with an upside-down face that they had in storage may be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The only trouble is that before they have this epiphany, a little brat (Archie Yates) may have lifted the doll during an open house.  They've got to steal it back, and how hard can that be when the kid's family has left him home alone on their Tokyo vacation?  Like taking candy from a baby, right?  Now I can't lie here: I watched this with basement level expectations.  I think the first Home Alone is just fine for what it is, but the second is just a glorified remake, and I never even took the time with 3, 4, or 5 (yes, I'm counting the TV movie).  I can't speak for the other sequels, but I'm having difficulty imagining them stooping lower than Home Sweet Home Alone.  I don't even know how to review this movie.  It's broken up into thirds with defining acts if you're looking to digest it in thirty-minute blocks instead of just one go.  The first third is setting up this wacky scenario that could be solved with a simple conversation.  The second third is the recon stage where this married couple showcases that they would be maimed by incompetence even if a bloodthirsty child wasn't in the equation.  The finale, as you can already guess, is all of the traps.  The setup isn't great, but it isn't offensive.  It sets the expectation that I wasn't going to get any laughs, but at least it doesn't pretend like we are here for something else.  There is not a likable character in sight, and that is what I think this movie's biggest downfall is.  You understand the situation this married couple is in, and I've enjoyed Kemper and Delaney in the past, but goodwill will only get you so far.  These two characters are both schlubs, and neither have a redeeming quality about them.  This would be fine if you wanted to root for the kid, but he is also equally terrible.  I don't like to come down hard on child actors, but Archie Yates is no Macaulay Culkin, and this is not a kid you want to spend your time around.  I spent the majority of this movie looking for something nice to say about it, and I've got nothing.  They got the same actor back that played Buzz for a cameo scene if that is important to you, but everything about this just screams cash-grab.  I feel like this could have potentially made me angrier, but that hardly can be counted as praise.  I never found a moment to make me laugh, and you should actively avoid this.",

Sure, while this child actor is better than the ones from Daddys Home and gets more screen time, the transition to the kid learning his lesson, isn't earned because before the transition, the kid is a spoiled brat that is more laughable than relatable. Sure, kids will see that how the protagonist acts in the beginning is wrong, adults might find this kid repulsive. Personally, I don't know why the hell the kid hero is english. Its Home Alone.

He chose not to. \nThey didn't need to sell to their house if the dad had just gotten any job while looking for a good career job replacement. He chose not to.\nThe husband and wife could have knocked on the door to ask about the missing doll, or called the police, instead of breaking in. They chose not to.\n(Spoiler alert!!) There was no plot point at all, we find out. The doll was in the house the whole time. The fat, ill-behaved kid became friends with the people who could have rang the doorbell to ask about the doll instead of destroying his home. The mom came home. All is well. There was a simple misunderstanding, no real conflict. The battle between adults and kid was so far from needing to happen, but the producers didn't care - they just needed to milk to the cash cow a little more.\nI was generous with the extra half star on account of Buzz's role.",

Max Mercer be like I wish I was and I was like just shut up you annoying brat it's just so bad. This kid Max Mercer is not likeable or relatable at all. Now going to the ones busting into Max Mercer's home I feel it's just aweful that they don't get to explain to Max right away that they are just looking for that weird looking Doll with the upside down head that could get them a whole ton of money because they did need it for their family. They are put into quite a few toture traps that just makes me feel bad for them and this just shouldn't happen for the supposed to be Villians I really don't like at all that Disney made a innocent couple Pam and Jeff to be seen as bad guys that needed to be tortured only seen by Max Mercer because he thinks they are trying to take and sell him. They do get to explain but they just shouldn't have became friends and spend time together afterwards that made it bad. Harry and Marv were a thousand times better to see get hurt as they were bad guys and they deserve it for not giving up. I would stay just watch orginal Home Alone 1 and 2 they are the great Home Alone that I always enjoy better than the rest of the other Home Alone's they all really Disappointed me the original cast is still the best of all Home Alone content that is what I feel I'll be doing for now on.",

With big name actors like Ellie Kemper and Rob Delaney, it is expected that they will get a lot of screen time, and while they play their roles to the best of their ability, the amount of development given to them over Archie Yates' character is one of the reasons this film doesn't work. All of the Home Alone sequels are a rehash of the original, all containing a child-focused story about people trying to break into his house with a massive showdown at the end with traps, and while Home Sweet Home Alone (2021) contains the latter two, it doesn't trust Archie Yates' enough to be the lead of this film, despite him showing in Jojo Rabbit (2019) and in his little screen time here that he has a fun charisma. And with the focus more on the adult characters it tackles some adult themes like financial struggles which won't really appeal to its young target audience.\n\nThe attempts at humour are dumb and unfunny, which would be fine if everything else was targeted towards kids, however there were too many plot holes and bad character decisions to look the other way.\n\nHome Sweet Home Alone (2021) proves that not every popular movie needs a sequel, and definitely not five sequels.",

It has very much the same overall gimmick as the original Home Alone, with a few slight variations (the \"burglars\" are likable and sympathetic characters who aren't trying to hurt the kid who gets left home alone).\n\nI disagree with the critics on this one. The movie is exactly what I expected and quite honestly a better sequel than the others that preceded it. It's still nowhere close to the original, but again that's not what this movie is trying to be.",

In fact, there is no point in this movie that recreates the sense of peril faced by Kevin in the originals. And the whole reason you watch one of these movies, the trap sequence, is only about five minutes long and isn't super imaginative. One good thing I'll say is that the movie borrows liberally from John Williams' scores for the first two films, but hearing that music will only stir up memories and nostalgia for far more engaging films.\n\nDisney+ has the first two Home Alone movies, maybe the third as well.
