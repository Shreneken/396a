It's not perfect, as the script tends to be a little inconsistent at times in terms of both believability and pacing, but the direction is claustrophobic enough and the acting particularly convincing. Moreover the makers handled the transition of the characters brilliantly and, to top it off, didn't enslave their creation to a forced ending.",

While awaiting medical help, he finds himself locked inside with the convicts during a viscous riot. Thinking quickly, he poses as a convict and gains the trust of the leader of the rioting inmates. Juan must try to keep his real identity secret and work covertly with the authorities outside who are desperately trying to regain control of the situation. However, with enemies all around him and concerned for the wellbeing of his wife, the young man finds himself in an increasingly hostile situation. This is a terrific Spanish thriller from director Daniel Monz\u00f3n. It is a full throttle, macho and violent affair but handled with skill and flair. This isn't the sort of film I'd normally go for but I thoroughly enjoyed watching this gripping movie. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "I never really felt the need to examine the definition of word \"Protagonist\", that was until I watched Cell 211 (Spanish: Celda 211). Earlier, I had a notion that protagonist should be virtuous and altruistic. I had to refer Oxford English Dictionary which defined protagonist as \"the main character in a play, film/movie or book\" and that protagonist doesn't necessarily mean the righteous one. Halfway into the film is when you will apprehend the reason why I am boring you with these definitions.    \n\nThis 2009 film from Spain is one of the most iconic films about prison politics. The first thing that comes into everyone's mind when they think of prison is \"don't drop the soap\".  Cell 211 examines the cause and effect of prison subjects very far from much hyped soap business. What if Prison, the very purpose of which is to confine and incarcerate people charged with crimes, uses criminal methods to provide correctional officers with unwarranted advantage over inmates to such extent that one may say enough is enough? If history has taught us anything, it's that nothing is permanent. What if inmates were to stand up against tyranny of correctional officers? Do their past crimes validate the methods used against them? Sometimes the line that separates right from wrong becomes so thin that one may question his judgment and morality. We, as an audience, constantly face this dilemma while trying to pick up sides during the whole length of movie. \n\nThe film has one of the most memorable opening scenes that don't really serve any purpose to the story line but its there for a reason and the reason alone is to warn the audience that this film does not care about their expectations for some kind of release or catharsis. It would be a sin to describe the scene to the uninitiated. It must unfold itself as it slowly grows inside you and sets the tone of the film. The movie starts as an investigation of events leading up to the conclusion of prison riot. Juan Oliver, newly appointed prison officer, decides to take a tour of prison but an accident knocks him unconscious and he is rushed by prison officers to empty but apparently haunted walls of cell 211. In the mean time, murder of another prison guard by an inmate (an extraordinary one) quickly develops into a riot leading to convicts breaking free and hijacking control of the penitentiary. Aware of the violence that is to come, the prison officers flee, leaving Juan stranded and unconscious in the heart of the riot. When Juan awakens, he immediately takes stock of the situation; in order to survive, he must pretend to be a prisoner. \n\nCell 211 may be about the chaos of prison riot but its essence lies not in violence but rather in beauty of friendship in the most unusual of circumstances between two polarizing characters, Juan- the prison officer and Malamadre- the inmate. Script transforms into a character study, in which the prison inmate, Malamadre, becomes a scholar of depravity and the younger Juan experiences it in a pitiable and personal way. The enigma of Malamadre's character is at the heart of the film, and this is one of Luis Tosar's best performances. He embodies authority naturally; much like his other works such as Te doy mis ojos 2003. Here he knows all the lessons an inmate might internalize during years spent in what we learn is one of the worst prisons of the country. Malamadre is introduced early into the film and dominates the film from that point forward. This actor is entrusted with big assignment. He embodies Authority. Like Hans Landa, his character must be played by a strong actor who projects not merely villainy but authoritarian. Observe his face- Smug,Self-satisfied. Listen to his voice-Articulate, analytical. Mark his composure and apparent fearlessness. The film essentially depends on him, and would go astray if the actor faltered. He never does.\n\nElena, Juan's pregnant wife, brings a note of compassion into the picture. Watching the film, we assume Elena's character is simply a place-holder, labeled protagonist's wife and denied much depth. But she is saving her impact until later. The film is fast paced with chaos erupting one after another wherein the flashbacks of intimate moments between Elena and Juan comes into play to provide the story with more passion. The most interesting part is watching Juan win the confidence of Malamadre and other inmates with his wit and playing a double-agent at the same time.\n\nI learn from internet that the name \"Malamadre\", seemingly so meaningless for us non-Europeans, actually serves a purpose.  Malamadre literally translates into Bad Mother in Spanish which is a plant oftenly called as Spider plant (botanical name Chlorophytum Comosum).  The spider plant is so named because of its spider-like plants, or spiderettes, which dangle down from the mother plant like spiders on a web signifying the persona of Malamadre's inherent character as the inmates' confidante.\n\nLike Malamadre, Cell 211 keeps its words.",

There's one scene that seems unlikely - slight spoiler, a much-hated guard is thrown to the wolves - but the rest of the movie is white-knuckle drama (with a surprising and interesting political dimension behind it) that takes a character and tests him in a way a few films do. Brave, exciting work that swept the Goyas (Spain's Oscars) in 2009. Definitely see this one.",

The things he does to blend in are horrifying, and the actor behind it all is brilliant.  Malamadre also has ample star power and fight between these two leads for prison and screen dominance has great back and forth tension.  Although it allows itself some leniency as far as believability, you get so lost in the story it'll likely go right over your head.  Cell 211 is well acted, astonishing and will likely leave you thankful you're not on the wrong side of prison bars.",

Some of the prisoners are also caricatures we've seen before, but the performances are committed enough to let that go. It could have scored higher if it had been 10 minutes tighter in the plotting, which would probably have edited out some of the weaker scenes. \n\nBut this is definitely an above-average prison thriller. Apparently there's a Hollywood remake in production. All I'll say is that I hope it sticks with the convictions of its Spanish source material. There are no studio endings here, and some pretty savage plot twists that don't feel at all like normal studio material.",

I won't tell you when this is, so you can experience saying out loud \"this has turned from a five star film into a three star film\" simultaneously with your friends as I did when first watching it.\nFans of violent prison dramas will be thrilled reguardless, and it is worth watching just for the exceptional performance of Luis Tosar as the psychotic Malamadre, but this could have been so much better.",

The film wastes no time getting into the story as it  begins with the new young employee at the prison, a day early, ready to begin his new job, when all of the sudden the situation spirals out of control until before you know it he's lying in a prison cell bleeding. Although I did feel that this beginning was a little rushed, I do prefer it to when their is a long unnecessary build up to the main story in which your eagerly anticipating.As the film progresses the story becomes ever more interesting and intricate, with the help of the film's superb characters. Malamadre (played by Luis Tosar) delivers a terrifying passionate performance, in my opinion making the film what it is.\r\n\r\nHowever it comes with the characters that brings my biggest disappointment, although the majority of the characters were interesting, I found that most were completely unbelievable and unnecessary. Malmadre's gang is heavily involved in the story but most of them just stand around doing nothing, then occasionally 'pop their head around the door, and drop a bombshell'. Even the character of  Malmadre I thought at times was given an awful piece of dialogue to say which just turned off the intensity of the film and made it a bit unbelievable, obviously this is due down to the screenplay, therefore it would be unfair to judge the actors performances. Some aspects of the characters I believe that they got right, the director ,Daniel Monzon, resists the temptation to create another 'Hollywood hero' and instead creates a much more realistic character who helps to work the film along in a believable manor.\r\n\r\nOverall however, despite the frustration over the character's, this film delivers an exciting and punchy drama, worthy of your attention. \r\n\r\n80%\r\n\r\nCalum.Russell",

Trapped inside the sealed-off block, he successfully passes himself off as a fellow prisoner.  And he's in the special detention block, so his new friends are the worst of the worst.  As the riot progresses and the situation deteriorates, he's forced to do all the things the other inmates do -- up to and including murder.  The unfolding drama outside the cell block, as prison and government officials scramble to rescue not only the trapped guard but a few Basque prisoners the Spanish government doesn't want harmed (lest a new wave of Basque terrorism be unleashed on Spain) is equally tense and suspenseful, and there are plenty of surprises toward the end as informers and turncoats are revealed.  It's a great story.  There are some awfully brutal scenes, and while you may avert your gaze from time to time, you won't be able to tear yourself away from the movie.",

There's more to it though-a character piece about what we might do to survive, on top of a piece of social commentary that recalls Dostoevsky's claim that if you want the measure of a society, look at the way it treats its prisoners.

Seldom are remakes anywhere near as good and yet again, this will prove a hard one to match.\n Juan (Alberto Ammann) is about to start work as a prison guard and is taking a tour of a maximum security area when he is injured slightly in an accident and left behind as a riot breaks out. Juan convinces Malamadre (Luis Tosar), the convicts' leader, that he is a new inmate who has been beaten up by guards, and the two men become close as the crisis escalates.\n The film opens with the look of a low budget television film and at first I began to think I shouldn't have listened to the plaudits I'd read of this. Not before long though, it really kicks into gear and cranks up the tension and excitement. Within minutes I was hooked. I'm an avid fan of prison drama's, with their high level of suspense and on edge atmosphere and sense of danger. This is no different and wastes no time in exposing you to the violence and brutality of the inmates. Helped no end by two excellent central performances, particulary Luis Tosar as the snarling dominant ring leader. Director Daniel Monzon keeps the story briskly moving with several moments of unbearable and skillfully handled suspense and the fact that it avoids the usual genre conventions with many unexpected plot developments, helps in keeping you captivated and wondering what direction it will go in. European cinema seems to be reaching a bigger audience these days and this is another worthy of attention. \n Fans of the 2009 French film \"A Prophet\", or any prison drama for that matter, should find plenty to enjoy here. An excellent well crafted film that delivers tension in spades.",

He pretends to be a prisoner himself, to stay alive, and fight for a way out to be reunited with his pregnant wife. The film heads down a gritty, dark outcome route (somewhat predictable) as he teams up with the jail leading psycho (Malamadre) to fight the system.\n\nI would argue this is more accessible than other foreign arty films such as Prophet and Elite Squad, and being much better than recent prison based films (Experiment, Dog Pound and co) being essentially gratifying, without being too supercilious, arty or serious.\n\nMales (15-40) should especially love this film (if you can stand the subtitles and light culture) and I recommend it to film fans, suggesting it is more entertaining than anything of wow note or of recognition.",

Juan Oliver (Alberto Amman), a young man who just started working in a prison as a guard, wants to make a good impression and goes a day before his scheduales first day. At the same time, the inmates inside, lead by dangerous Malamadre (Luis Tosar), start a riot. While all of the guards escape of the prison, Juan is knocked unconscious in an accident. He then wakes up in Cell 211. He wakes up and passes himself as an inmate and befriends Malamdre. While all of this is happening, Elena, Juan's pregnant wife, learns about the riot and goes to the prison to make sure Juan is okay. But during the disturbings outside she is fatally injured. Juan starts working undercover for the police so he can inform them about the riot, and help them with the negociations.\r\n\r\nThe film is like The Shawshank Redemption crossed with The Departed. This Spanish thriller is little known, but what a great film it is. The whole film I was intrigued, thrilled and on the edge of my seat. Daniel Monzon, a new Spanish director, makes this thrilling and creates the whole world of the prison. He works very careful on every detail of the film, and the result was fantastic. A very good director, and I hope he makes more films this good in the future.\r\n\r\nThe story and characters were great and touching. The screenwriters do a terrific job. The premise is thrilling, and put into screen is better. A very dangerous situation, that not many men would put themselves through. They do a very good job also with the characters. From the harmless and delicate Elena, to the dangerous Malamadre, all the characters are the way they're supposed to be: human. They show their flaws and their attributes. The characters that are supposed to be likeable they are, and other character that we should hate we hate them. Even Malamadre, who seems to be one of those characters we are supposed to hate, as the story progresses we start liking him. And we can't help it but feel sorry for the poor Juan Oliver, who not only is on a life and death situation but also his wife is on the hospital and has committed crimes since he got into the prison that might get him in ail, plus if the other inmates discover about his true identity he's dead!\r\n\r\nThe performances were top notch. Alberto Amman, who plays Juan, does a fantastic job with his character and all his scenes. While he slowly descends, we can truly see the transformation Juan is suffering through him. Marta Etura, who plays Elena, also does a very good job here. The indefense Elena is put into the screen through this fantastic actress in a very good way. But the highlights for the acting goes to Luis Tosar, who plays riot leader Malamadre. He truly steals the show. I think this might be one of the greatest performances in a foreign film, and possibly in cinema. From simple expressions to powerful scenes of anger, he masters it all. He is definetly the best actor in this film. He doesnt play Malamadre, he becomes Malamadre.\r\n\r\nThis film is fantastic. From the story and characters to the amazing performances to the impressive direction, this film is great in everything it does. The film won 8 Goya Awards including Best Picture, Director, Screenplay and Actor for Luis Tosar, all well deserved. And the film definitely deserved an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, and possibly to have won. For those who enjoy prison films and thriller films, and don't mind reading subtitles they should check this one out. But good luck finding it! And trust me, it is worth the time and money you might spend looking for it.",

If you are Juan Oliver in the film Cell 211 you quickly discover that surviving at all costs is both a skill and an instinctive response. I'm not sure how realistic this film is in the quest to portray dilapidated prison conditions which house Spain's worst offenders, but I sure hope I never have to find out. Besides, the film does not come across as a political message about the lives of prisoners in Spain, it is more or less a simple story of survival for one man trapped in a nightmare who has to make unthinkable choices at every turn. Perhaps there is more significance to those in Spain or the surrounding area, but as an American viewer I appreciated the film as an entertaining and intriguing story all by itself.\r\n\r\nOne day before he is to start his new job as a prison guard at a Zamora prison, Juan Oliver kisses his pregnant young wife and goes to take a tour of the facilities. He is given the tour by 2 of his soon to be co-workers and he learns briefly about the conditions of the DSS prisoners - those who are marked for special surveillance and spend almost all of their time in solitary confinement taking regular beatings from officers. A split second later everything changes for Oliver. A freak accident leaves him injured just as a riot breaks out in the prison. Left with a choice to help him or save themselves the two guards bolt leaving Oliver stranded and wounded in the empty cell 211. When he awakens he is foggy but must quickly determine how to survive. Passing himself off cleverly as a new inmate, Oliver must gain the trust of everyone or be killed on the spot.\r\n\r\nThough staying on the good side of everyone in the riot is important, it is really only the opinion of the riot leader, Malamadre, that matters. A brutal killer with nothing to lose, he is well versed in the prison system and the art of negotiation. He knows that a riot is the only way to get better conditions in any form from the prison or the government, but usually once the riot is over the demands which were met are quickly dismissed. This time he has a better plan that includes the hostage taking of 3 political prisoners of great importance. \r\n\r\nThe film contains some cliche moments and some caricatured characters, but overall the interplay between Oliver and Malamadre is superb. One is a regular guy, decent, the other a complex murderer, and it is up to Oliver to make sure their relationship stays civil. Along the way Oliver must make personal sacrifices which border on the unthinkable, and in the end he must struggle greatly with a turn that he could have never foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe film is shot in a grainy texture that I admire for the subject matter, and though you have to suspend disbelief for some of the plot, the overall theme is carried well throughout and sometimes portrayed with brutal and striking violence. Psychologically this is a strong film that will leave you thinking as the credits roll. The film won 8 Goya awards, which is equivalent to a film sweeping the Oscars. I'm not sure it deserves all that, but it is definitely a worthy film of your time.",

Soulless brutality pisses me off. \r\nHowever, if you love movies, you must see this film.\r\n\r\nCell 211 smashes onto the screen with a cover-your-eyes graphic wrist slitting suicide. You\u0092ve got my attention, but what else have you got? Everything.\r\n\r\nThe story is set in a present-day Spanish prison during a riot and is as taut a thriller as I\u0092ve ever seen. The set up is a new prison guard Juan Oliver (relative newcomer to the screen, Alberto Ammann) is getting an orientation the day before he starts. Falling masonry from a maintenance operation renders him unconscious. His fellow guards decide to put him in cell 211 and bring the doctor to him. Oops, the charismatic leader of the prisoners Malamadre (Luis Tosar, I\u0092ve seen him in Limits of Control) chooses that moment to launch a riot to force the administration to address the prisoner\u0092s grievances. \r\n\r\nTension? How will Juan survive? He pretends to be a prisoner.  Don\u0092t see it on a full bladder. \r\n\r\nCringe moments worthy of Reservoir Dogs? Yes, but they\u0092re rooted in the essence of a great story, not slapped on for effect. Every fountain of blood means something important. Awesome adapted screenplay by Director Daniel Monzon and co-writer Jorge Guerricaechevarria that ups the stakes at every story beat.\r\n\r\nSocial redeeming importance? Yes, it has the elements of an expos\u00e9 but manages to keep that subtly in the background. It also manages to increase the tension by throwing in a political dimension with a handful of ETA political prisoners. \r\n\r\nInspired cinematography and sound? The sounds and pictures magnify the dynamic of the drama and even manage to create heart-stopping images of beauty without detracting from the gritty reality. Kudos to cinematographer (Take My Eyes) who has worked with Monzon several times before and to Roque Banos (Sexy Beast, The Machinist) for an empathetic score that knows its place. .\r\n\r\nGreat characters? Oodles of them. Malamadre is both brutal and cunning, but has a thirst for justice. Juan; he descends the elevator to hell as he tries to play both sides of the game.  The sly, duplicitous rival of Malamadre, Apache (Carlos Barden, yes, he\u0092s Javier\u0092s brother) and the ineffectual bureaucratic head of the prison ( Manolo Solo, Pan\u0092s Labyrinth).  Throw in prison guards trying to do the right thing, Juan\u0092s pregnant wife, brutal prison guards, the SWAT team standing by to end the riot by any means necessary, prisoners running amok, lying, scum-bag politicians and Cell 211 delivers fist \u0096in-the-face drama with a side order of teeth-clenching tension.\r\n\r\nMonzon uses his relatively small (by Hollywood standards) 5.7 million dollar budget to outclass any number of soulless action films\u0085 and he cleaned up at the Goyas (Spanish film awards). It\u0092s criminal that this film hasn\u0092t received a wider US release. \r\n\r\nIf you love tension married to great drama (and can get past a few cringe moments), You must see this film.",

The story of this 8 Goya Award winning (Spanish Oscars!) film follows a newly hired prison officer finds himself in the midst of a prison riot after an unforeseen turn of events. With the inmates around him unaware of his position, he must pretend to be a prisoner to survive. As from the beginning with mounting amount of tension the story evolves in unexpected ways, changing our perceptions of characters and the situation again and again. This film has it all, intelligence, action, drama, suspense, sadness and even a dash of comedy through all the madness. Kudos to the director & the entire cast for their spectacular performance that mostly contributed to made it so intense & engaging till the end.",

Why am I not surprised when I clearly should be.  Prison movies, especially those clashing the police with its inmates has long existed in the most exploitative of state.  Later on, world filmmakers saw the opportunity to politicize the genre and make bold statements. In 1984 even Israel produced BEYOND THE WALLS about Arab-Israeli clashes within the prison system.  It went on to foreign acclaim.  Well 25 years later, Spain has it's own rebellion headliner of sorts.  The long-stemming rivalry between the Spaniards and the Basques is used here to channel a formulaic nail biter in which a new prison guard is accidentally left behind bars during an uprising and tries his survival instincts by playing for favours with the leader of the revolt. While never boring, it has the pacing of a serialized drama and lacks in depth of characters.  Everybody speaks with a tele-roman sense of urgency and the socio-political elements are washed out in favour of overly saturated histrionics.",

There is a riot, violence and, in the confusion, young trainee Juan (Alberto Ammann) is mistaken for one of the inmates. He becomes trapped with hundreds of vicious cons as tense negotiations begin between prison officials and the inmates\u0092 leader, Malamadre (Luis Tosar).\r\n\r\nAnd this is where the movie lost me.  Implausibly, the tough, shrewd Malamadre is so impressed by a couple of seemingly pro-inmate suggestions made by newcomer Juan that the hardened con and the stubble-faced young man quickly become Best Friends Forever.  This plot absurdity turns what might have been a tense thrill ride into a series of \u0093yeah, right\u0094 moments.\r\n\r\nI don\u0092t generally read a lot of reviews before writing mine, but yesterday I noticed two local scribes with opposite takes on \"Cell 211.\"  Said Critic Number One: \u0093It's a great, simple premise, and I will be surprised if we don't get an American remake \u0085 this may be one case where a remake is justified.\u0094  Said Critic Number Two: \u0093I'll bet you $100 that Hollywood snaps up this property for a glossy, star-studded remake.  I'll bet you $1,000 that this version is better.\u0094\r\n\r\nI\u0092m taking the side of Critic Number One.  For once, Hollywood has the opportunity to actually improve on a foreign film.",
