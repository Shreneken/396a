            "content": "IN A NUTSHELL:\nI was intrigued to watch this movie because I'm an author and author coach. The film's description says: After a bestselling novelist suffering from writer's block hires a new nanny for her children, the line between fiction and reality starts to blur. It's a psychological, erotic thriller that is so badly executed that I'm giving you fair warning here.\n\nTHINGS I LIKED:\nFans of Sex and the City will be excited to see Kristin Davis starring in a feature film. Unfortunately, she's not a strong enough actress to save this film. Her character is conflicted in many ways. I thought it was sweet that, as a mom, she had different handshakes to say goodbye to each of her kids when she dropped them off at school.\nGreer Grammer stars in the movie and also produces it.\nI liked the original musical soundtrack by Drum & Lace.\nEvery author's writing process is different. In the movie, we see Kristen Davis' character writing her book with pen and paper, rather than on a computer. I have some author clients who do that. We also see her create a storyboard on a big board, a technique I recommend to my clients because it really helps you \"see\" the story develop and allows you to be very intentional where you place certain scenes.\nHusbands and wives need to be extremely careful in order to protect their marriage from external relationships and impropriety. For example, my husband NEVER drove home our female babysitters. It wasn't that I didn't trust him or our sweet babysitters. Too many crazy things can happen based on what other people think could have happened, you know? It's just not worth it. No, people shouldn't assume or judge, yet they do.\n\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nEven the title isn't original. So many books have been written with the same name.\nI'm surprised that Dermot Mulroney went for this script.\nWeird and creepy. I mean who takes a complete stranger bra shopping? That's the first scene when you realize the movie is ridiculous and it just gets worse.\nIt's often hard to know what's really happening and what's fantasy. Of course, that's the point because the protagonist can't either. Then again, the execution and writing are so bad that it makes you wonder if the writer and director even knew.\nThere are some really terrible acting moments.\nThere's a terribly cliched flower moment.\nLots of exposition.\nThere are twists but they're ridiculous with so many details that don't make sense. We're left with more questions because Act 3 is a complete mess.\nThere were some \"Gollum\" moments that made me laugh out loud. (The psycho hobbit in the Lord of the Rings)\n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS:\nThis movie is NOT appropriate for children. Plus, they'll be bored anyway.\nYou see a married couple rolling around under the sheets. Then later, they do it in a kitchen closet.\nYou see some skin when two best friends are in a spa sauna & shower.\nA pretty girl wears an immodest bathing suit. You see her in a bra many times.\nThe mom smokes cigars as a symbol of her warped and developing manly obsessions of a young girl.\nA woman goes skinny dipping in the pool. Later, you see part of her naked chest in a bathtub.\nTons of inappropriate sexual illusions.\nTwo women kiss.\nYou see some blood in a murder scene.\nSome profanity, crude language, and an F-bomb\nYou see the naked backside of a man in a shower\nViolence.\n\nYou can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",

I thought the acting was great, I didn't think it was drawn out, and it honestly kept me guessing throughout the whole movie including the ending, which can sometimes be irritating but in this case it was kind of cool. Without giving away too many spoilers. So I think anyone who loves thriller movies who don't mind a mostly female cast then this is definitely a watch for you.",

The plot meanders along in the middle and ramps up at the end when a series of events happen in quick succession. Would be better if more twists and tones in the middle of the 2 hour movie. Would prefer that \"Margaret\" made a brief appearance earlier in the film, seems like an afterthought at the end. And (spoiler alert) the killing of the black best friend seemed cliche, gratuitous and unnecessary. The mystery could have unfolded more all along, and too much time was spent showing the 55+ aged middle aged couple rekindling their romance.  Mary's relationship with Grace was complex and fascinating, but again, the plot could have better defined it, instead of focusing on long melodic love scenes. Very interesting film, if you like the Lifetime feel, and it would be great to see Kristin Davis in many many more. The 3 of them were all great. Also it would have been better to show more of the relationship between the nanny and the husband, as again, that came at the end out of nowhere. Hints and brief moments of that earlier in the film could still have kept mystery yet made the plot stronger.",

Finally, in the very last scene, we see someone we think is Mary leaving the hospital after visiting with someone we think is Grace. But her hair is covered, and we only see her from a distance (and overhead), so we can't really say definitively that it's Mary. And it isn't: it's Grace leaving the hospital after a visit with Mary, who is by now living out the story in her head 100% of the time.

I honestly can't tell you what happened at the end. If you want to watch a similar movie but is actually worth your time, check out Nocturnal Animals.... I kind of think the director was going forsomething similar to Nocturnal but completely missed whatever he was setting to achieve.",

Shanola Hamption, of Shameless fame, is a standout in this one.  Aside from Shanola- very disappointing.",
