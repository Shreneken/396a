There was no issue with feeling something\u2014the entire package was a beautiful, heart-wrenching, playful, heavy journey through a gay love story at a boarding school in late \u201880s Taiwan. Clocking in at nearly two hours (and probably could've cut a significant portion out of the epilogue arc to achieve the same effect), this one is a significant investment of time and energy but the well-acted, beautifully shot story of Birdy and A-han is well worth the saga it takes. I admired on a personal level the decision to make the story more about the love between two friends and not knowing what to do with this love than about sex.\n\nYour Name Engraved Herein should become the required romance drama viewing for gay men (way less problematic than Call Me By Your Name, way more fun than Brokeback Mountain); pretty highly recommended for everyone else.",

            "content": "I loved it.  I thought the two young actors did a very good job or portraying the frustrations of being in a very close relationship at a time, and in a culture where society was not as tolerant of anything resembling same-sex involvements. as well as a portrayal of the pressures youth face in a repressive environment as they are coming of age.   It was hard to watch JIa Han give his all to the relationship and Birdy hold back, and eventually walk away from the friendship for the sake of propriety, even though I felt his feelings were equally strong.  I think perhaps if Jia Han hadn't pressured Birdy quite as much, the relationship may have moved forward more easily in spite of it all.  Birdy could not cope with the idea of being gay and perhaps could not cope with his own feelings toward JIa Han.  The scene where Jia Han calls Birdy and sings the song to him over the phone, was heartbreaking for me.  Which speaks to the skills of the two actors, in my mind, as they really drew me into the sadness and frustration inherent in that call,  The song is beautiful, not only the music, but the words as well.   The composer did a good job.  It is now stuck in my head and I am attempting to learn the lyrics.   I have watched a few BL dramas and I was surprised at some of the scenes in this one. Most of the mainland Chinese ones are heavily censored to insure these relationship look like \"brotherhoods\" rather than anything involving sexual attraction or even love.  Not that it works, because lingering looks and innocent touching gives it all away anyway, and the fans let their imaginations take it all to new heights.  To the point where they are determined to prove that the actors themselves are in a gay relationship in some instances.  \"The Untamed\", though not strictly a BL drama, was based on a very explicit book, much of which would never be portrayed in anything that was governed by Chinese censorship. In that one there were the lingering looks, but no hand-holding.  In \"Word of Honor\" there was out and out hand-holding and explicit declarations of love (couched in the term soulmate), and many double entendres. In some ways I prefer the fact that these are not sexually explicit in that the interactions are rendered more sensual by what is undone and unsaid.  Interesting that there seem to be more  movies like this coming out of China.  They are highly intolerant of gay relationships and  do whatever they can to repress them. I hope the Chinese government willl not backtrack and come down with an iron fist and disallow any portrayals of anything that resembles caring or love between two men. There have already been some t.v series pulled off the internet for being too \"unwholesome\".  But apparently these films are also very popular, and they don't seem to object to making money off them.   I'm not sure about the ending of this movie.  I guess I would have like to see Birdy accept Jia Han's invitation to his room, but in a way the fact that they do end up at least walking off together gives one something to hope for.  All in all, I liked this movie very much and look forward to seeing more films involving these two actors as I felt there was good chemistry between them and they worked well together to bring the story to life.",

The cinematography is glorious, the plot is devestatingly beautiful, the acting is impeccable. You must watch this if you love LGBT films. One thing that's special about this film is that there's a complete lack of fetishization, which is so so rare with LGBT films. Even Call me by Your Name overly sexualized some scenes for no real reason. This film doesn't do that, instead focusing on the reality of being gay at a young age in a society where it's seen as not only different, but dangerous. There is no fairytale happy ending, but rather a hard-hitting realism which made me cry for at least an hour after watching it.",

Edward Chen's Han and Jing-Hua Tsang's Birdy are two high-schoolers in 1987 Taiwan who couldn't take their eyes off each other. Han is the quiet, sensible one who has hidden his sexuality away from his mostly homophobic peers while Birdy is the more extrovert and rebellious newcomer who at least initially seems impervious to any name calling. As their friendship grows closer and their intensifying affection for each other becomes less and less controllable, they face social and familial pressure and prejudices that threaten to tear them apart. Even though the themes explored here are familiar, Kuang-Hui Lui's film handles them, for the most part, elegantly with such panache and good taste, it even manages a few nods to French new wave and Cinema Paradiso. There is also plenty of sizzling chemistry between the central leads which give us two passion-fuelled performances that I really want to root for, despite some inconsistent character development (for Birdy halfway through the film) that seems to be there solely to create dramatic friction between the two. Crucially though, the film becomes entangled in a clumsy and over-complicated coda of an ending that couldn't quite balance poignant regret with a desire to inject a level of positivity and a more palatable endpoint for the film. Alternatively, it's possible editing gremlins have crept in and mess things up. Either way, and problems mentioned above notwithstanding, as a film about first love and all the heartbreaks it entails, this is a bittersweet and beautiful cinematic experience, but it would've been even better if it hasn't tried so hard with the ending.",
