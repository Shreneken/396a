Her misguided efforts to help only fray his nerves, but that doesn't stop her from nagging Joe to be more open about his feelings toward his ex-girlfriend and current boss, Lt. Gwen Harper (JoBeth Williams). When Tutti witnesses a brutal multiple murder, she takes her meddling to the extreme by tagging along to help her son solve the case.",

The film isn't as bad as people make it out to be, to be honest(Sly hates the film) and there are, I might add even some adorable elements. Sly plays a LA cop who is visited by his mother one fine day- she decides to stay with her son and interfere with his daily chores which result in the progression of the film. I prefer the simplicity of the movie(and indeed of cinema of that time) to the stuff we are being forced fed today- a film such as this will not be picked up at all nowadays which is a pity. I suggest you go with an open mind and judge for yourself. This is a nice film to add to you Sylvester Stallone collection. 6/10 (Nowhere as bad as people say).",

So it sounded almost like a satire of Sylvester Stallone's career, and I would not miss any of his films.\n\nThe thing with Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot is that the jokes are so terrible that they are hilarious. Everything was so pathetically written that I laughed at the idea that somebody would have actually put them in a film, and it was just hilarious. And because of that, I actually found myself laughing at the film. In a film where jokes are so stupid and unfunny that they become unexpected hilarious entertainment, Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot is one of the prime examples of the genre.\nThe idea of forming a buddy cop movie about an aggressive police officer and his own mother sinks into even more ridiculous territory than director Roger Spottiswoode's previous effort to team up Tom Hanks with a dog for Turner and Hooch. And it is hilarious how ridiculous it is. I mean, it's a childish story about a boy having trouble coping with his overprotective mother except that in this situation he is a police officer played by Academy Award nominated action hero Sylvester Stallone. And the fact that it is so clearly crazy, senseless and ridiculous makes it all the more entertaining as a film that is practically so bad that it is good.\nThe thing is that a plot this bad has little chance to succeed, but even Roger Spottiswoode knows that and attempts to make the most of it. While the jokes are not likely to find success with critics or a lot of viewers, I was very surprised to find myself entertained by them. I mean I knew they were stupid and cliche like they were written for a Saturday morning cartoon, but I still laughed at them for actually being there and for being so bad that they were funny. The cartoonish elements continued on into the musical score which is very childish but makes things have the light comedic feel they really need.\nThere is no denying the fact that Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot is problematic. I mean it is so stupid, and the comedy is so childish that its appeal is obviously limited. And the repetitive nature of it ensures that there really is not a spot of originality in the film, so Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot is easy to see as a bad film. But the fact that it was so ridiculously written is likely to get to many viewers. The script in Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot is so hilariously stupid and is clearly deserving of criticism because it is immensely  ridiculous. The stupid, childish and cartoonish one liners and so pathetically paper-thin that they are essentially impossible to work with. Yet somehow, in some way, the cast of Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot manage to actually work it into being funny material, even if it is funny because of how dumb it is. If you can really sit back and lower your standards to the level of Denzel Washington's film Heart Condition in Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot, there is a chance you will enjoy it. I know I did, and not just because I'm an avid fan of Sylvester Stallone.\nStop! Or My Mom Will Shoot is clearly the most ridiculous buddy cop film I've ever seen, but it is far from the worst. See, I actually laughed at it, and Roger Spottiswoode did everything he could to make the concept convincing by giving a great production design to the film and some colourful scenery, as well as some good cinematography which captures everything well and timely editing. And all this can be boasted in the action scenes. While there isn't too much action, there are some moments of it and it is somewhat entertaining. So Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot does have what it takes to succeed as a buddy cop film.\nBut what really takes the cake in Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot is that despite the ridiculously low quality of the script, the actors manage to actually work it really well.\nSylvester Stallone is an actor I find to be massively underrated and rarely appreciated for his comedic talents such as in Grudge Match and Tango and Cash. And while Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot is not as funny as either, he essentially parodies himself in his lead role in Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. He basically makes a satire of his whole career, and it is actually pretty funny to watch. He delivers his lines with his natural action hero charisma, and despite winning the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor, his performance was barely worth a nomination for such an award. He manages to make the comedic elements of Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot succeed more than they potentially could have, and so it is funny to see him up there.\nAnd Golden Girls star Estelle Getty is perfect  for the role. While her character is absolutely ridiculous, she is very convincing as the mother of Sylvester Stallone's character and the two share a fairly funny chemistry. She has all the aspects of a stereotypical mother figure, and when the time comes she goes over the top into the stereotype and establishes some laughs for viewers. She steps into the role with ease and manages to work the comedic material with her own charm, serving as a viable benefit to the cast as the titular mother in Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. I was pleased with her performance and had a good few laughs thanks to her.\nJoBeth Williams and Ving Rhames make decent additions to the cast as well. \n\nSo while it is every bit as stupid as the title and plot would suggest, Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot is a ridiculously bad comedy which becomes funny because of its stupidity and has surprisingly dedicated cast members including a great duo of Sylvester Stallone and Estelle Getty.",

            "content": "The absolute best thing I can say about this movie is that it doesn't quite live-up to the awfulness of other legendarily bad comedies, such as Going Overboard, Bio-Dome or Jack and Jill.\nThat being said, Stop! or My Mom Will Shoot is an overall joyless film that fails to deliver anything but maybe a few scant chuckles here or there due to sheer luck, or due to the fact that you're dying to laugh at something.\nA match made in Heaven (or more likely a Hollywood business board-room), the pairing of action-star Sylvester Stallone with one of the Golden Girls is almost ridiculous enough to warrant laughs itself, or rather the fact that some Hollywood mogul or moguls thought that this would be a good idea is what warrants laughs. I think one of the factors that lead to this preposterous film's creation was an attempt to replicate the financial success of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1990 movie Kindergarten Cop. I think it's safe to say at this point that regardless of your opinion on Kindergarten Cop, that attempt did not succeed, as Stop! or My Mom Will Shoot is far, far worse.\nThe key word to remember with this movie is \"predictable\". Once you know the premise, you can guess 95% of the set-pieces, jokes and situations that will crawl weakly across the screen in an attempt to make you laugh. She tries to tuck her obviously-too-old son into bed at night, she meddles in his love-life, she tells his coworkers at the Police Station embarrassing stories about his childhood, she nags him to eat healthier and maintain better hygiene. These are punctuated by the odd scene every once in a while of Estelle Getty being at the right place and time to fire a gun or witness a crime in progress. The shenanigans are so bland and easy to see coming they're almost painful they're almost painful.\nStop! or My Mom Will Shoot is a best forgotten relic. It's a celebrity vehicle with a weak script and an even weaker pay-off. It is not recommended for anyone aside from film-scholars studying Hollywood embarrassments or cinematic masochists.",

So many over the top, and even boring scenes, fill this movie. Stallone is bad as the star, although Estelle Getty wasn't that bad as is mother and with another script, could have originated an interesting character.\r\n\r\n\"Stop or my mom will Shoot\" could have been a movie so flawed\r\nthat it could easly become enjoyable.
