With fear running through the abbey, the church leaders call forth Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham), William's nemesis, to find the truth.",

It successfully transports the viewer to the historical period depicted in the story and the performances are great, above all Sir Sean Connery's, which earned him a BAFTA. The story is deeply entertaining and intriguing and it reflects on the controversial issues of the time, when the Inquisition decided on the validity of historical texts. As expected, the movie evidently shows just a bit of the grand masterpiece written by Eco, which I'd very much like to read.",

In the name of the rose is a bromance in the form of an Master/Apprentice relationship, a detective movie, a great performance by Sean Connery, that always manage to look decisive and fair, and last but not least a poignant  critique on religion.

            "content": "I first heard about The Name of the Rose when I played a board game called Mystery of the Abbey that bears some similarities to Clue, but was all about finding out which monk committed murder in their abbey. That‚Äôs when someone mentioned to me that there was a book and subsequent film about the exact same topic. I was instantly fascinated, and that interest only increased when I found out Sean Connery was the star. The idea of a murder being perpetrated in a holy place is an interesting concept, and having it investigated by a monk as well makes it even more intriguing. I always like murder mysteries, but when they are set in this kind of environment it ratchets up the tension because of how close-knit and insular their little society becomes. The Name of the Rose is at its best when it allows Sean Connery and Christian Slater to be detectives. Their relationship is a good one, because that master-apprentice connection makes it so Connery has to vocalize to Slater what he‚Äôs thinking, and at the same time that tells us. There was plenty of suspicion thrown around in the film, and I never felt like the identity of the culprit was obvious. It helped that so many of the monks seemed insane, disgusting, or at least unpleasant. That made it so you could never get comfortable in this location, and it was easy to suspect everyone. The final reveal of why the crimes were committed was crazy, and didn‚Äôt quite live up to the severity of the murders, but at least I didn‚Äôt see it coming. I had some big problems with certain subplots that were clumsily tacked on to the film. In particular the romance/lust story between a peasant woman and some of the characters was an awkward distraction that I found annoying. Knowing how little it played into the plot makes me wish I had just skipped the whole thing. I think it was supposed to add some extra tension in the conclusion, but because I was not at all invested in that character it was pointless to me. There were a few other details that felt like they either needed to be fleshed out more or jettisoned from the script. I think all this extra nonsense was added to deflect suspicion from the real murderer, but I‚Äôm not sure it was needed. I still think there‚Äôs a kernel of a good idea in The Name of the Rose, but it didn‚Äôt come together into a film that lived up to that potential for me.",

Sean Connery is on decent form as one of the very few likeable characters, while a very young looking Christian Slater is fine as the apprentice monk. The best aspect by far though is the bleak, cold, and impressive looking setting which incorporates an actual Italian fortress, and some of the location work and cinematography is very good. Above all else this is a murder mystery, and because of the setting it makes for a quite unique and interesting watch. And despite the pace overall being a touch too slack, this is still a fine, slightly obscure watch.",

As a medieval thriller, The Name of the Rose is absolutely first rate, and should appeal to all mystery film buffs, whether they've read Eco's book or not. Connery convinces in his cassock and, though the themes will not capture everyone's interest, this is a refreshing, inventive whodunit. Connery and Slater both do admirable jobs here as detectives in the mold of Sherlock Holmes and Watson, although Slater seems to play his character in an almost constant state of confusion. F. Murray Abraham, meanwhile, is second-billed in what amounts to little more than a cameo as the grand Inquisitor, who's called in as the deaths pile up and the monastery hosts an important theological conference. Ron Pearlman is phenomenal in early career turn as manic hunchback. Annaud is also sly enough to keep the grip of belief front and centre, keenly creating one of the most original whodunits of recent years out of one of those so-called \"unfilmmable\" books. Annaud does not shy away from extreme gore, horror makeup and a vivid sex scene between Slater and Valentina Vargas. The whodunit is also well-constructed, engaging and, better yet, makes complete sense.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

            "content": "1986 film adaptation from Umberto Eco's best-selling novel, The Name of the Rose, is a witty murder-mystery film bound to leave a permanent impression.\n\nName of the Rose begins with a Franciscan monk William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) arriving to a religious convention with his apprentice Adso of Melk (Christian Slater). What was supposed to be a peaceful theological gathering at Italian monastery soon takes a turn for the worse as monks start to die under mysterious circumstances. While others seek a more divine explanation for the deaths, William of Baskerville being a man of reason resolves to more earthly investigation techniques to explain the violence.\n\nWilliam of Baskerville as a character is a satisfying combination of legendary investigators like Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot, with a little religious twist which makes him unique, and I could think of no better match to portray the character than Sean Connery with his genlemanish charm. From the directing perspective, French director Jean-Jacques Annaud's realistic directing style and his brutally honest depiction of middle age monastery life and its downright grotesque people and oppressive atmosphere might put off some viewers, but I found it a nice change from modern day Hollywood cleanliness.\n\nThe film does have a rather slow start but thankfully the intensity picks up around half way to the film as the murder mystery plot deepens. Also could not ignore some of the abrupt scene changes with the film which seemed bit out of place and tell of less than perfect transition from novel to film, but these were minor glitches and nothing great enough to hinder the film's overall resolve.\n\nThe Name of the Rose is not an easygoing film but I urge everybody to give it a try as it has a terrific cast, involving story and its out of mainstream directing style provides a realistic peek into one of the darkest time periods of mankind's history.",

The theme of humor is introduced without hardly any build up which takes away from the cerebral element that the audience of a movie like this would enjoy.  Again, the sex scene also runs against what the audience for this kind of movie would want, it was very gratuitous and Uwe Bolish and made me wonder if I was watching Blood Rayne, and not a decent medieval mystery tale.\n\nI would recommend this movie for adults who like slightly freaky films that are slow paced and thoughtful or if you are a Sean Connery fan.",

And while it actually really grew on me, it's still not much more than a decent flick.\nThe premise sounds great: A crime flick set in a medieval monastery and a monk (played by Sean Connery) as investigator. Throw in an awesome cast and some serious gore and you got your film.\n\nThe basic plot and idea of the film is great indeed, I only had one big issue: The film, again and again, becomes gimmicky throughout the movie. The straightforward plot and the well-written characters thus suffer from sensationalism. The film is shot in a pretty naturalistic manner, and most of the time the characters behave quite logical but then, out of nowhere, they added elements no one asked for, that maybe worked well in the novel but feel kinda rushed and unnecessary in the film (e.g. the peasant girl or the other Franciscan friars who arrive).\n\nI appreciated the mysteries of the library or the fancy way the murders were executed but I think Annaud tried to squeeze in too much of the book's content.\n\nMy props to Sean Connery who plays William of Baskerville (an homage to Sherlock Holmes) pitch-perfect, as well as to Eco's script which gives us one of the better crime mysteries and settings that I've seen so far.",

The monastery and its inhabitants deliberately avoid the pleasantly placid view of diligence and harmony with the earth.  The monks in fact go beyond realism and most of them are grotesque in a Gothic sort of way.  The premise is exciting and novel, as is the twist at the end, but F. Murray Abraham's character exists for...uh, dramatic tension I guess.  He wasn't really needed and his comeuppance was predictable and bland.  He did have a couple of juicy exchanges with Connery's sleuthing ascetic, but he and the whole Inquisition needn't have bothered showing up at all.

Granted, every monk there seems to be straight out of the freakshow, with Ron Pearlman - one of my favorite actors - as a twisted hunchback.  I kind-of lost the story at various points, not being well versed in the ways of ancient monk lore, but it did echo and likely inspired modern pop stories like Angels and Demons and the DaVinci Code.

Granted the atmosphere and setting is impressive and you are drawn in by the mystery that lurks beneath the hoods of these bizarre monks but after a while you're just saying: 'For the sake of Saint Francis, wrap it up!!!'.

Sean Connery is at his most enjoyably- hammy as Franciscan friar/armchair super-sleuth William of Baskerville, called in to solve the various murders by the chunky Abbot (Michael Lonsdale). Along for the ride is Christian Slater in an early performance (And thankfully before he started needlessly channelling Jack Nicholson-) as naive novice monk Adso of Melk--kind of the Dr. Watson to Connery's medieval Sherlock Holmes. Very talky, at times overlong, with meandering plot-twists and red-herrings aplenty, but well worth the experience, as the acting is uniformly marvelous, and the hideous characters will make you feel you're attending an old-fashioned carnival freak-show. The fiendishly-funky friars are essayed by an impressive and offbeat international cast, with Elya Baskin (As the goofy apothecary Severinus-), Feodor Chaliapin, Jr. (Essaying ancient, blind, and wraith-like Jorge de Burgos-), Michael Habeck (As the enormously-rotund and effeminate Brother Berengar-),  raspy William Hickey (As withered mummy-like Ubertino de Casale ), Helmut Qualtinger (As corpulent-and-horny glutton Remigio De Varagine-), and vulture-like Volker Prechtel (As secretive & sociopathic librarian Brother Malachia-) rounding out the gallery of gloriously-grotesque gargoyles. Also of note are Valentina Vargas as an unrealistically beautiful & super-model-like peasant girl who becomes embroiled in the unpleasant-and-unseemly goings-on, F. Murray Abraham as bloodthirsty Inquisitor Bernardo Gui, and Ron Perlman as the brutish and demented hunchback Salvatore. A supremely different and intriguing murder mystery, not easily forgotten.",

Aldo is approaching his sexual and intellectual awakening, he is the narrator of the film who expresses bafflement at the deadly mystery at the ancient Abbey, and is at awe of Brother William's deductive powers.

Astute direction by Jecques Annud who does an amazing job of transporting us back to a primitive dark time in the world, where fear and primal emotions rule. This moody epic thriller was actual filmed at a 12th century monastery. There are tremendous supporting performances by F.

There are so many themes that developed well during the movie, I love especially the theme of power's corruptions. I don't remember if this movie or the book made such a worldwide hype like \"The DaVinci Code\", but one thing I know for sure.

Anyone familiar with the book might be disappointed in the elements missing - the sense of forbidden fear and mystery of the library, the erotic awakening and confusion of young Adso and the gradual discovery and exploration of the labyrinth, as well as the dense historical and theological detail, but then that is to be expected in a film adaptation.",

The things that strike out to me about this movie is the balance it tries to strike in the soul of William the Franciscan Monk between the logic and learning he holds dear and the faith and religion he sees as abandoning both logic and learning.  His love of the books and his banter with Burgos the blind Monk, the missing text, and the poison pages.  The jabs at established religion is here, but it is not wholly cynical or hateful.  It questions like William about both faith and practice.  An interesting and captivating movie with great acting that has held up through the years.  Finally, I just cracked up at Williams bibliophile and his desperate chance to save some of the remaining books.  Coming out of the burning building fool of soot and bundles of books in his hands is comical and understandable from another bibliophile.",
