The movie also highlights the dire consequences that can ensue from disrespect by men, particularly those struggling with anger management issues and low self-esteem.\nThe movie shows in an unlikely manner an \"ajosshi heroship,\" celebrating the protagonist's accomplishments and triumphs. While the film briefly touches on the protagonist's history of domestic violence within his family, it does not present this as a major obstacle to his becoming a good person.",

The acting is solid and the cast delivers the characters well.\n\n\"Why are you taking it, you cunt?\"\n\nI recently came across this on Netflix and added it to the queue.  I am a fan of these foreign pictures and while this may not have been as good as Ishii the Killer or Old Boy, it was an intense action picture with a storyline worth watching.

Having lost his sister and mother at a very young age, due to accidents relating to domestic abuse, he is eternally angry on his father and fate. His despise for the people who can't stand up for themselves (stemming from witnessing his helpless mother) makes him even more violent towards his debtors. His attitude towards people and life starts changing after he bumps into a high school girl named Yeon-Hue. Being a father figure to his divorced half-sister's nephew Yeong-in, and his affection for Yeon-Hue brings out the compassionate side in him. But, as most times, cruelty has a price to pay...\n\nThis inspiring film marks the Writing & Directorial debut of talented actor Yang Ik-Joon, who stars as the lead as well. The passionate camerawork by Yun Jong-ho follows the characters in an intriguing way, using which the Director tells a compelling story about violence and abuse, interspersed with moments of humour and warmth. All the main characters are developed quite well, and are given proper depth and screen presence. All the actors involved give commendable performances.\n\nThe movie is as visceral as the punches thrown by the characters in this hard-hitting drama;  it's a thought-provoking tale on the cycle of violence.",

            "content": "I do think this film is probably longer than it really needs to be.  You could tell the same story about the cycle-of-violence and Song-hoon's search to stop his violent ways, due to his very violent and tumultuous childhood, as he comes to care for a young woman and his nephew in 110 minutes.  It definitely should've been kept under two hours, it would've helped with the pacing and some of the scenes wouldn't have felt so aimless.  With that said, this is still a pretty damn good film.  Might be one of the better Korean dramas I've seen in a while, maybe since Sunshine and Poetry.  I realize that might not be saying much, considering the rating, and it really isn't, but the fact that so many Korean dramas devolve into cheap melodramatic tactics in order to manipulate your feelings doesn't make for a good film, in my estimation.  If you've followed my reviews, and why would you, then you know I can't stand the constant melodrama seen in these films.  Which is why it's a great change of pace when you get a movie like this, that's surprisingly unsentimental.  Yes, it has its dramatic moments near the end, but it never feels exploitative or cheap.  I thought the story was strong because, while you get to see the worst side of the main character, through his physically, and verbally, abusive ways, you also get to see some moments of warmth and tenderness out of the most unlikeliest of characters.  It doesn't really feel forced, because the character, until one very traumatic moment nearing the end of the film, doesn't really begin to change.  He's still very physically abusive when he's out collecting the money his boss is owed.  And he's still verbally abusive to those around him, but this aspect of him is more comical than anything else.  Though there's times, where Song-hoon, after his father is released, lashes out more at those around him and his verbally abusive ways becomes a little more troubling than comical.  It was cool seeing how Song-hoon brought all those around him closer together in a positive way, even after ***SPOILER*** his death.  This ending isn't particularly predictable, because Song-hoon himself even alludes to it.  Not in a direct way by saying 'I'm going to die', but saying that there's always someone out there that's tougher than you or more violent than you are, he was saying this in reference to a man that owed him money that was beating on his wife.  And that's exactly what happened to him at the end, but not before he made, as mentioned, a positive change in the lives he touched.  Again, it doesn't feel forced or cheap.  It comes across organically in the film.  And the ending, as in the final shots of the film, are particularly bittersweet, because, as mentioned, you get to see the positive impact he had on the people he met, but you also see that the cycle-of-violence will, in fact, continue.  It has its flaws, mostly the fact that it is too long, but it's still a damn compelling, dark Korean drama.",

This is a film full of genuine emotions and relationships. Superbly acted and a fine effort of directing. A minor flaw was that it was a little too overt and on the nose especially with it's flashback scenes depicting the characters past; sometimes they felt like exposition that could've been presented in a more organic manner rather than being conventional using flashbacks. But the final few flashbacks work extremely well. The scenes right before the hospital scene and final scene in the street are excellent and brave, it left me winded as if I'd been hit in the stomach by one of Hang Soo's punches. Those additional scenes in the end could've been a little less sentimental, but it that point the film earns it and it does help tie up any loose ends. But for me, it would've been just as powerful if we, the audience, were left hanging like Hang Soo. I don't think the director needed to connect the dots as much as he did but again, it doesn't take away anything from the film and considering it's his first, I'll be looking forward to seeing what he does in his upcoming films.",

Right from the beginning youâ(TM)re dropped into the world of Joonâ(TM)s protagonist and there is little let up. As far as explorations of the cycle of violence go Breathless is a very human picture with brilliant central performances by Joon (in the title role himself) and his opposite lead. It's a brilliant piece of work and could well be the best film I've seen of 2010.",

Following the exploits of an ex triad gang member working as a debt collector for a loan shark. His shockingly violent tendencies & unnecessary brutality harbours deep emotional turmoil thats solely due to growing up in a household filled with domestic violence & a dark family secret that he struggles with everyday of his miserable life. That is until he befriends (in both horrific & humourous fashion) a foul mouthed high school girl struggling with domestic violence herself. This touching friendship is the soul of the film, as dislikable as both characters are, the support they show for each other throughout the film shines a light of hope in both their lives & leads to some seriously powerful moments that moved me to tears. Avoiding the cliches that riddle all films of this type, Joon has crafted a beautiful, angry & tremendous movie that you will never forget.",

Violence is the issue here, both physical and verbal, and Yang sets the mood from frame one, with the relentless camera registering his emotionally corrupt main character engaging in some very ugly and seemingly random physical abuse. The theme is hardly foreign to Korean cinema, in some instances even serving as comic relief, but Yang obviously has a different agenda, making sure the audience gets the message. Yang's purpose, well-intentioned as it might be, is however slightly too transparent for a genuinely emotional effect, but the carefully structured, cyclical screenplay and the deft direction still makes Breathless an impressive debut work.",
