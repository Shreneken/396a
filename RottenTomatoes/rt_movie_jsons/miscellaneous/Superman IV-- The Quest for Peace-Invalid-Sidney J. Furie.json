    "summary": "Seeing the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a nuclear arms race that could lead to Earth's destruction, Superman (Christopher Reeve) decides that he must take action. He collects all the nuclear warheads from the world and throws them into space. Meanwhile, Superman's nemesis, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), has broken out of prison with a new scheme. He clones Superman with radioactive material to create Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow), a being just as powerful as the man of steel.",

            "content": "So obviously this movie is not better than the last two but the last one is actually the worst one but I actually think this movie is good. Action, I personally think that the action is good-great especially towards the end of the film. Acting, the acting in all the Christopher Reeve Superman movies are perfect. CGI, is perfect as usual. Villain, I think that Nuclear Man is definitely a powerful villain but I think that he could have done a lot better. Writing, is not as good as the first 3 and I don't really like it but it was ok. Story/Plot, I think that the Story & Plot are both very bad in this movie. Casting, I think that the casting could have been better. Characters I think that the characters is a 7/10 mostly because I really like Lenny Luthor. Adventure was bad. Mystery, I was bad. Ending I really like the ending it's always a 10/10",

            "content": "The Salkinds had made three Superman movies and planned a fourth if Superman III made at least $40 million. It made $80 million even if people absolutely hated it. As for star Christopher Reeve, he was pretty unenthused about coming back to the role one more time and skipped being in Supergirl, which bombed, as did the Salkind's Santa Claus: The Movie.\n\nYou know how much Golan and Globus loved Cannes, right?\n\nWell, that's where they made a deal with the Salkinds to buy the rights to Superman movies for $5 million.\n\nThey then got Reeve for $6 million, approval over story and director, a focus on ending nuclear weapons and financing his movie Street Smart.\n\nCannon was already $11 million down and the movie hadn't even started filming.\n\nReeve wanted to direct, but other than some second unit, he wasn't ready for a full film. Wes Craven was supposed to be the director, but he and Reeve didn't work well together. Reeve asked for Ron Howard and got Sydney J. Furie, the maker of The Entity, Iron Eagle, The Taking of Beverly Hills and two Rodney Dangerfield movies, Ladybugs and My 5 Wives.\n\nConsider that at one point, Cannon was almost the studio that made a Superman and a Spider-Man movie at the same time.\n\nIn his book Still Me, Reeve noted that Cannon was cutting budget anywhere they could, even shooting scenes set on 42nd Street in England. He said, \"We were also hampered by budget constraints and cutbacks in all departments. Cannon Films had nearly thirty projects in the works at the time, and Superman IV received no special consideration.\"\n\nIn fact, Cannon reduced the budget from $36 million to $17 million, but would still lose money, as their strategy of selling TV and video rights before the movie was made worked with smaller movies, but not with this budget, even as cut down as it was, even with the crew replaced by cheaper crews, even with shooting Smallville in England.\n\nThere was also a really bad test screening that caused 45 minutes of the film was cut, including another nuclear man that Superman destroys. Also by cutting the movie from two hours to ninety minutes, theater owners could get two more showing a day and make more money.\n\nThat said, while the movie made $36.7 million worldwide — and still made money on its cut budget — people hated it. It was the last Superman movie for 19 years and Reeves said, \"Superman IV was a catastrophe from start to finish.\"\n\nAt one point, the more monstrous Nuclear Man footage was considered for use as a sequel in which Superman would die at the hands of that creature and would be resurrected in the bottled city Kandor. This was years before the death of Superman story and somewhat close to what happened in the comics.\n\nAnyways…\n\nSomehow, Cannon was able to get Reeve (Superman/Clark Kent), Margot Kidder (Lois Lane), Jackie Cooper (Perry White) and Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen) to return. It starts with a big downer, as both of Superman's Earth parents are now dead and there's no way Marlon Brando is going to be in this movie.\n\nMeanwhile, the Daily Planet has been taken over by David Warfield, a tabloid tycoon who fires Perry White and replaces him with his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemingway). Also, the world is on the brink of nuclear war — which seemed quaint for a few years right? — and Superman grabs all the nukes, puts them in a giant net and throws it into the sun, which seems kind of dangerous.\n\nLenny Luthor (Jon Cryer) breaks his uncle out of jail and they meet with the military industrial complex who wants to kill Superman like they did Kennedy, so they all make a Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow) who can infect the Man of Steel with radiation and kill him. Also, there was a reason why Superman looked at that Kryptonian energy module in the beginning because it heals him.\n\nWhat follows is the best kind of dumb: Superman pushes the moon and causes an eclipse, which shuts off Nuclear Man but does not cause giant waves that destroy Earth. Lacy is left in space, floating around with no oxygen but she's fine while Superman activates a nuclear power plant by dropping Nuclear Man into it and powering the entire world and that should be no danger either, before bringing Lacy back and saving the Daily Planet.\n\nComic book movies wouldn't recover until Tim Burton's Batman.\n\nCannon wouldn't live much longer.\n\nReeve would be paralyzed eight years later.\n\nSuperman IV was finally redeemed by just how bad Batman and Robin was.",

Perhaps it was the fact that the Salkinds were no longer in charge. Perhaps it was because the new producers gave too much creative control to their principle actor. Certainly the cut in budget to a mere third of what was spent on Superman II did not help. The result is another silly, cheap instalment in the franchise that made it clear that the well was dry and there would be no Superman V starring Christoper Reeve. The concept at the core of the film, that the earth needs to be rid of nuclear weapons, has some merit, but the screenplay that emerged from that idea is lame. The idea that Superman's DNA could somehow be used to create an alternative flying man who looks nothing like Superman and is created as a fully grown, talking man in an instant when some nuclear bombs are hurled into the sun....argggh. The acting is terrible, the special effects are rubbish and the script, let's just say it needed work. We've already seen Superman battle some flying super-powered adversaries in Superman II. We didn't need to see an alternative version in Superman IV, especially not this hairsprayed, buffed, golden tanned rock star-looking villain that is \"Nuclear Man\", played by Mark Pillow. The fight scenes with Superman and Nuclear Man were not well conceived and poorly filmed. Even the ending was bad. If Superman really wants to do good in this world, he should give the audience their money back.",

Nuclear Man however isn’t really that great of a Villian, but his fight scenes with Supes are pretty cool. I also would have liked if Clark didn’t give Lois that mindwipe kiss (Again!)

Right from the offset, the special effects look cheaper compared to the previous films. For instance, the Cannon Group simply reuses the same shot of Superman in flight, and during the moon scene, you can actually see the black curtain that should represent space. The action is boring as well, and none of the actors even appear interested in where the plot's going either. As if to showcase the \"boring action\" problem, for instance, Superman and Nuclear Man don't even punch each other in battle. So yeah, \"Superman IV: The Quest for a Plot\" or \"Superman Farce: The Search for a Quick Buck\" could have fit the film better for titles. Clearly this film didn't work for me.

Instead, Superman just went up into space so he could throw the nuclear missiles to the Sun.\nA bizarre, loosely-written plot, not only that, but almost every scene, especially for the Nuclear Man and Superman fight scene, whenever the next shot comes, the music keeps changing into another music.\nThe movie keeps having the exact same shot of Superman flying is used for every single shot where he is flying, and the film barely gets any amount of screen time for Clark Kent.\nBadly-done overdubbing.\nLame fights, and actions choreography.\nCountless plotholes: From Lenny Luthor cutting Superman's indestructible hair with a pair of ordinary bolt cutters, to Superman rebuilding the Great Wall of China with his rebuild-o-vision, to Lacy breathing in outer space.\nSuperman seems to be on a massive ego trip throughout the movie, from dictating terms to the nations of the world to the bizarre scene where he jumps off a ledge while holding Lois as Clark Kent then reveals himself to be Superman after letting her fall for several seconds. This is supposed to be charming, by the way.\nThe idea of having a Superman film during the brink of nuclear war is a pretty questionable idea in the first place, and what's worse is that the movie has a lot of terrible social commentary, with hamfisted anti-nuclear weapon and anti-war messages.\nNuclear Man is a generic and lame secondary villain who isn't that intimidating or even threatening, at all. He's just a downright very goofy and super poorly-developed villain.\nHis weakness is being isolated from the sun. He is a solar-powered nuclear man. However, there are SEVERAL scenes where he is not in sunlight and he's doing just fine.\nThe scene from the first film where Superman flies around the world with Lois is terribly redone in this film.",

This being the ground floor of that descent, it bears little similarity to the original film beyond several key casting choices and a spit curl. Christopher Reeve returns as the title character, of course, with Margot Kidder suffering an expanded role and Gene Hackman back from a one-film exile to ham it up once again as a clueless, underwhelming Lex Luthor. Filling the Richard Pryor \"why?!\" role from the previous film is Jon Cryer, better known as Duckie in Pretty in Pink, who plays some sort of pointless, meandering male twist on the Valley Girl stereotype that was rolling through culture at the time. I'm still not entirely sure why he was elbowed into the plot. This isn't aggressively bad like Superman III, it's just hopelessly inept. In fact, the core of the story has a lot of potential: Superman, inspired by a letter from a young boy, destroys the world's nuclear armaments and discovers that some problems can't be solved quite so easily. It sputters and fails right on the launchpad, though, and soon falls back on a muscle-flexing brawl with some generic evil menace to solve the problem. Its grasp on physics, and reality as a whole, is so loose it's almost adorable. I'd pat my four-year-old son on the head and smile if he suggested we move the moon around to keep the sun out of his eyes, but for this film that's a legitimate solution. To say its answers make any sense would be an insult to sense itself. The whole thing plays like an easy answer to a complex problem, from the story to the editing to the acting to the effects work. These older superhero movies don't hold up to the rigors of time as a whole, but Superman IV looks particularly bad in a modern setting. Even the hero's indistinguishable costume seems cut-rate and fake, like they'd forgotten to commission a wardrobe department until the night before production. Head-shakingly pointless and dull, this film only seems to exist to kill time. Which, thankfully, it doesn't demand in great quantities. While the original cut came in at over two hours, some greedy last-minute cuts trimmed it down to a slim ninety minutes. Why the late edits? To ensure a few more showings each day at theaters nationwide. Of course.",

It plays even poorer today. George Reeves' '50s iteration of the Man of Steel might prove to be classic television, but the staid silliness of the series hasn't aged well. That said, the entire run of that program looks positively naturalistic and ripped-from-the-headlines when compared with the insultingly over-the-top goings-on of Superman IV. With a villain so laughable that his appearance single-handedly turns the production into an outright comedy, Superman IV is riff-worthy from the word 'no.' \n\nIn this painfully bad PG-rated sequel, the Man of Steel (Reeve) crusades for nuclear disarmament and meets Lex Luthor's (Hackman) latest creation, Nuclear Man. \n\nAlexander and Ilya Salkind, the producers of the first three go-rounds, smartly chose to sit this one out. Gene Hackman, however, returns to cash a sizable paycheck and create a Solar-powered Superman clone with a perfectly coiffed mullet. That Superman creators Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel lived to see this dreck put the nail in coffin of a once-decent franchise is appalling...though certainly not as appalling as Warner Bros. not compensating them for creating an American icon...but a close second.\n\nBottom line: Nuclear Waste",

It's a little like the sun-stare for too long, and you'll feel physical pain.\n\nBut then you start to feel a little bad for the film-the obvious runt in the Superman litter. The project was fucked since Jump Street. No one cared. Reeve, Kidder, and Hackman sat in their trailers laughing maniacally while they stared at their fat paychecks. Producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus trimmed the budget originally promised to director Sidney J. Furie by more than half, resulting in a film that, in addition to making less sense than Superman III, looks incredibly cheap. But once you get a look at Nuclear Man (yep), you'll start to feel angry again. It's a shitty cycle succinctly summed up with one simple sentence...Superman IV SUCKS.\n\nWeirdly enough, the film doesn't start out all bad. It wants to explore a mostly untouched aspect of our hero's lore: his parents' instructions to never interfere with Earth's business or history. The nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union is at an all-time high, and there's real fear that war is nigh. A young boy writes Superman (Reeve) and asks him to stop the insanity, and our hero doesn't know what to do. He confides in Lois Lane (Kidder) before wiping her memory of the fact that Clark is Superman once again. He visits the Fortress of Solitude for some guidance from his mother (voice of Susannah York). His conclusion: it's time to step in. Superman declares to the United Nations that he'll destroy every single nuclear weapon.\n\nThis isn't great news to the just-broken-out-of-prison-again Lex Luthor (Hackman). Alongside his breakdancing nephew Lenny (yep), played by Jon Cryer, he concocts a plan that will replicate the creation of life using the power of the sun and a strand of Superman's hair. It goes off without a hitch, and Nuclear Man (played by Mark Pillow, voiced by Gene Hackman) is born. His \"father\" instructs him to kill Superman and also warns him that he'll lose his power if he's ever out of the sunlight.\n\nUgh, where to start? Nuclear Man is probably the worst thing that's ever happened in a comic book movie (a category of awfulness that also includes Tobey Maguire's gothic cool guy nonsense, as well as bat nipples). Why does he have Gene Hackman's voice? It's so weird. How does any of it make sense? How does Luthor know all the rules? And better still, if he was born out of the sun, where'd he get such a killer outfit?\n\nHonestly, though, the Nuclear Man stuff is a fucking abomination. There's a crazy around-the-world fight between he and Superman that goes on forever and ends up on the moon. At one point, the villain actually takes a human being outside the atmosphere before Superman rescues her and brings her back to Earth. It's utterly careless, completely uninvolving, and lacking any semblance of a positive, praise-worthy characteristic. And then Nuclear Man is gone. It's so abrupt that you can't help but wonder if someone read the script and simply told Furie and his writers to just kill the thing in five or fewer pages. Denoument? Fuck it.\n\nThe film's other essential thread deals in the world of The Daily Planet, where a tabloid tycoon, David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker), fires long-time editor-in-chief Perry White (Jackie Cooper) in an effort to throw ethics out the window and sell more papers. Like the rest of the film, this thread goes nowhere other than to give White a predictable glory moment toward the end of the film.\n\nThe chemistry between Reeve and Kidder that so captivated us in the first two films has completely fizzled out by IV. We're treading on awfully familiar territory, and the curveball thrown their way in the form of Mariel Hemingway (as David Warfield's daughter, no less) isn't at all developed.\n\nAnd the film truly is as passionless as the Superman/Lois romance is here. There's a reason it took nearly 20 years for Superman to return to the big screen after The Quest for Peace. It's that bad. It escapes my clutches with a token half star because there's a bit of perverse entertainment in its awfulness. But I take pleasure in the fact that it never made back its money, that it killed a few careers. It should have. It's horrible, terrible, stupid, dumb, sad, pathetic.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/superman-iv-the-quest-for-peace-review/",

The production values are there on screen for all to see.  The special effects are laughable comparable to the 1950s television version never mind the 1978 movie original. Some scenes are simply stolen from the predecessor films to save money it would appear.\nThe reason being the involvement of Cannon films in the production instead of it being a solely Warner Bros film.\nCannon were renowned in the 1980s for producing trashy B films. Video stores at that time had shelves full of their rubbish Chuck Norris starring films. I've had to revisit some of the Cannon cannon out of some cinematic torture!\nThe budget was apparently halved just prior to production and that explains this films problems really.\nThe story does actually have potential. I believe that the late Superman star Christopher Reeve has a storyline credit on the film. Given a proper Hollywood budget it could have worked.\nInstead the film attempts to be Pinewood/Hollywood quality at the old  Elstree film studio/Milton Keynes!\nThe plot centres on nuclear weapon proliferation that probably had some CND/Jeremy Corbyn influence.\nSuperman single handedly rids the world of nuclear warheads by collecting them in outer space in a giant net before throwing them at the Sun!\nIt is not explored if Israel/Iran/North Korea are involved in the worldwide venture!\nThe running time of the film was slashed in post - production to 90 minutes from just over 120 minutes.

This time Lex Luthor clones his own super villain to fight Superman.  Mariel Hemingway plays the daughter of a media mogul who buys the Daily Planet and tries to turn it into a tabloid scandal newspaper.  Her main purpose is to be a romantic rival to Lois Lane for Clark Kent's attention.  The movie was made when President Reagan was negotiating arms reduction treaties with the USSR.  The writers of the story decided to use the arms race to push the anti-nuke agenda and to use as the main story plot line.  They made the same mistake the comic book writers made in the 1940's and 1950's.  During World War II there was no real Superman to defeat the Nazis and the Communist.  During World War II and the Cold War Superman in the comics battled aliens from outer space but never confronted real world bad guys.  When they tried the public didn't buy it.  It doesn't work here either.  The other problem was Superman is so powerful it's hard to find a bad guy to oppose him.  That's why in the comic books they used space aliens.  In this movie Lex Luthor builds a villain for him to fight.  That turns the movies into Superhero boxing matches.  In the comic books Lex Luthor was able to match Superman because of his superior intellect.  In this movie he only tries to use a substitute to battle Superman's strength.  The old Superman TV shows from the 1950's had better stories because they concentrated on Clark Kent.  On TV Clark Kent was a serious character who solved crimes and only came in as Superman to save the day at the end of the show.  The movies made Clark Kent into a clown.  The only good thing about this movie is that Christopher Reeve was the best actor to ever play Superman and this was his last Superman movie.",

            "content": "Going into SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE, I was totally prepared for this to be an unwatchable mess. To my surprise, this was a Superman film that actually dared to be about something. Yes, the special effects are cheesy and the worst of the series. Yes, Lex Luthor is back as the villain of the week, and Nuclear Man is one of the stupidest villains I've ever seen. But, one thing sets this apart from the other entries in the series: this is a Cannon film, with all that implies. Cannon Films are best known to me as the home of several of Chuck Norris' early titles, and they're known for schlocky, low-budget stinkers that are \"so bad they're good.\" While I wouldn't quite put SUPERMAN IV in that category, there are a number of elements that, given a bigger budget, could have made this an awesome film. Even still, it's very watchable and certainly more entertaining than SUPERMAN III.\n\nThe basic plot has Superman campaigning for worldwide nuclear disarmament. There's also trouble at the Daily Planet as a rich businessman tries to take it over and turn it into a vehicle for sensationalism as opposed to real journalism. However, Lex Luthor is back on the scene and isn't about to let Superman eliminate a lucrative business and creates Nuclear Man to take him on.\n\nFirst, the good, which is actually more than you would think. The story this time is a marked improvement over the silly one in SUPERMAN III. Christopher Reeve has a story credit on SUPERMAN IV, and I have a feeling that he was instrumental in the direction the film took. Addressing nuclear disarmament and war profiteering (to a lesser degree) was/is a timely subject, and particularly so in 1987 when the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse. Granted, the bulk of this message is contained in two speeches that come off as straight-faced moralizing, but the fact that they tackled the issue at all is commendable. I also liked how Superman is treated as a more international hero than a purely American icon. Here we get to see Superman rescue people (who aren't Lois) in other countries besides the US. In terms of technical details, despite being a Cannon film the production values aren't too bad. Even the acting is perfectly fine (with one huge exception). In fact, most aspects of the production are acceptable except...\n\nThe special effects, due to the low budget, are pretty awful. In particular, the flying sequences and fighting in space were very bad. Still, all of this is understandable when you consider who produced this film. What I didn't care for at all was Nuclear Man and Jon Cryer, who plays Lex Luthor's nephew. While he played a fun, quirky character in PRETTY IN PINK, Jon Cryer was absolutely risible here, and his character was annoyingly stupid. He also affects this accent which just adds to how much I hated the character. His presence made me long for Otis and Mrs. Teshmacher. Then there's Lex Luthor's latest creation, Nuclear Man, who his birthed when a missile carrying a strand of Superman's hair explodes in the sun. If that origin wasn't bad enough, his appearance was also ridiculous. Fortunately they had the foresight to dub Gene Hackman's voice over the muscle-bound non-actor who played Nuclear Man. The last thing I'll comment on is the length of the film. Basically, it could have stood to be a little longer and develop the high-minded themes that it dared to address.\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised at how watchable SUPERMAN IV turned out to be. By no means would I consider this a \"good\" movie, but its heart is in the right place. It might have been hampered by a reduced budget, rendering the special effects more dated and cheesy than its predecessors, but the story and themes are an improvement from the overly silly SUPERMAN III. It also has a certain B-movie charm that allows you to overlook the sub-par production values. Bottom line, I'd sooner rewatch SUPERMAN IV than SUPERMAN III, but it still doesn't hold a candle to the first two.",

The idea of Superman interfering in the arms race might have had potential for intriguing film, but Cannon's choice to hire hack director Sidney J.

It's not the only fourth movie in film franchise to be considered a franchise killer, it's in line with Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin and Alien Resurrection - both are  fourth installments for their own film franchises, that totally blew everything.\n\nIn Superman IV we see Metropolis's hero stop a train full of passengers from crashing, and he does it like he's using the force or something - I never knew director Sidney J. Furie intended to use Luke Skywalker in the movie or something. There's also constant scenes of stock footage of Superman flying towards the camera, which is awfully bad. He possesses super powers that he never obtained in previous movies or in the comics - like he rebuilt a part of the Great Wall of China with an eye vision power, and the effect was dreadful. Superman also spends time disposing of post-launch nuclear missiles, after he vowed to bring peace to earth. He secures the missiles in an unbelievably huge net and disposes it by tossing it into the sun. A certain nuclear missile Superman was unaware of contained a device with Superman's DNA, and after it was disposed of in the sun, it creates an alien life form. The alien acquires super powers and is the devily and un-scary super villain Nuclear Man. He was made by and programmed by prison escapee Lex Luthor, who's back in Metropolis for his new evil genius scheme: the invention of Nuclear Man - the killing of Superman.\n\nMost of this content clarifies Superman IV as a flop and a movie worth avoiding. It's filled with plot holes. The acting is awful and the new characters that play a huge role in the movie, are completely dull.\n\nThe usual cast members returning from previous movies are Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Jackie Cooper and Gene Hackman - if you follow Superman you'll know who they play. Marc McClure makes another brief appearance as photographer Jimmy Olson. \nCast newcomers are: Sam Wanamaker ( Warfield ), Mariel Hemingway ( Lacey Warfield ), Jon Cryer ( Lenny Luthor ) and Mark Pillow ( Nuclear Man ).\n\nThere is very little credit to give Superman IV, but the superman himself still flies the high skies and brings help to the people whenever it is needed.",

            "content": "I am amazed that anyone could give this film more than 1 star when it doesn't really deserve that. This film is a bit like the movie equivalent of finding a fallen man in the road and nicking his wallet. The first two Superman films were outstanding. However Superman 3 was very average and a real let down. I didn't think the series could go any lower but then this one came along. As John McEnroe, ( I hope I have spelt that right), might say, \"you can not be serious\". Everything about this film is cheap. The effects are appaling, the acting is not much better and the feeble super villain was dreadful. Compare the three super villains from Superman 2 with the brainless 'nuclear man' from this film and you will see what I mean.\nThe only thing any good about this movie was the idea of Superman ridding the world of all nuclear weapons and forcing the world to live in peace. There was promise there however it was badly realised in my opinion.\nThough I didn't really like Superman 3 there were some good set pieces, my favourite being the battle between the good and bad Superman. The fire at the chemical plant and the final fight with the supercomputer weren't bad either. In Superman 4 there are none at all.\nDid my eyes deceive me or at the end when Superman saves the girl, was he really carrying her in his arms through outer space!!! That's alright then, so maybe all those astronauts don't need expensive spacesuits to protect them and feed them oxygen etc... I know that we there is a certain amount of leeway with fantasy films but there are limits. I can't believe that an error like this can get through, as it submits the film to further ridicule.\nThere is no doubt about it in my mind this film was just a cheap, cash in on the success of the other movies and should never have seen the light of day. They should have stopped after Superman 3, or preferrably after Superman 2. This movie demeans the memory of the first two.",

            "content": "Superman and Superman 2 were massive hits. They were uplifting, funny, and had something special about them. Superman 3 was a major drop from awesome to boring and heartless. \"Superman 4: A Quest For Peace'' is even worse. \n First of all there were a few things I liked about the film. The original score was nice to hear. The film opens with Clark returning to his old farm home. This was a solid opener for the film, but it goes downhill. The characters are all stupid. Mainly Mr. Luther's new partner in crime. We'll call him \"Weird Hair Kid''. \n  The film contains: dumb cops, dumb remote control cars, a strand of Superman's hair holding up 1,000 lbs, and a ton of rehashing from the first film. \n The acting first of all is okay, however, you can tell Reeve and Margot aren't really giving it their all at times. Probably due to the awful script. \n Back to the positives: Their is some better comedy this time around compared to the lifeless forced comedy of the previous installment. Clark is more bubbly as he was in film one, and their is a great scene between him, Lois and that other girl. Gene Hackman does a decent job as Luther as always, but he gets annoying after he mentions how genius he is so very many times. Their are some classic throwbacks that make you smile. It felt more like a Superman movie than 3 did. \n Now for the really ugly: First off, the special effects are unacceptable. The first two films had awesome practical effects with great action. They put so much effort into it. This time, they were lazy. Terrible fight scenes and really bad green screen. Special effects were much more advanced at this time they should have made them better. \n Next we have the side characters. The kid Jeremy cannot act. Luther's is stupid, and then theirs Nuclear Man...\n Their are so many illogical moments. Superman can speak Russian and Spanish?? Humans can breathe in space if flown up by a Nuclear man? Lois Lane can fly? Superman has powers he never had like rebuilding walls? Oh and he can use his mind to move things, AND use the Force???\n In short, Christopher Reeve's final Superman is not super, but rather dry, uninspiring, and stupid, despite its occasional laugh and throwbacks. 2.3 stars \n One hugely bothering thing was that Superman said he doesn't represent any one country. We must all unite. Superman used to be America's hero!",

The moon fight is really not well done, the effects are cheap.   How does that girl breathe and not freeze in space.   How can a bolt clipper cut a strand of Superman's hair?  That annoying kid.

No joking, that is the set up for this film. But don't worry that isn't even the stupidest thing about this film. \r\n\r\nLex Luthor, played by Hackman who returns to the series along with Kidder, escapes from jail and tries to make a genetic clone by stealing Superman's hair and attaching it to the rocket that he launches into space. Thus creating Nuclear Man, who was somehow born with campy suit and memories. Yup....\r\n\r\nPeople have often said that Superman doesn't have great villains. To that I say bullshit. He may not have as many great rogue gallery villains as Batman or Superman, but he has some great villains, and I don't just mean Lex Luthor and Zod. Brainiac, Toy Man, Parasite, Metallo, Doomsday, Darkseid, and many more. And what did the Director choice? Nuclear Man! A campy, stupid, over the top villain that doesn't even have a comic book counter part. This is by far the worst villain in the series. \r\n\r\nYou know your movie is bad, when your plot was not only parodied in a cartoon show (Justice League), but was actually made better and more realistic.

Superman IV is a huge mess no matter how you look at it, but on the entertainment scale it's damn fun to watch. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, I'll tell you I'm just appalled as everyone else with the problems in this film: the story is full of gaping holes, it's poorly edited, a lot of the special effects look like bad blue screen tests from the 60's or cutouts from a magazine and look very cheap, Nuclear Man is absolutely laughable and just growls a lot, the love subplot with Lacy is brought in and forgotten, a boy who plays a pivotal part in the story with sending a letter to Superman is brought in and forgotten too. That's really the biggest problem with the film: it's been hacked down from the original 2h 15min runtime to 1h 30min, and the worst and most sad part is knowing that a lot of the deleted scenes available to the public fix a lot of these plot issues, but yet we have to accept that they weren't in the final version and therefore presents story flaws. \r\n\r\nI can agree with everyone about how awful this film is, but I enjoy it cause it's so bad. You notice a new flaw or something different every time you watch the movie, the sissy fights between Superman and Nuclear Man are just so lame but entertaining to watch, and the movie is just one hilariously bad scene after another. But it's a mess that's so interesting that it's amusing, and I grow some sort of sympathy towards it knowing that a lot of it didn't have to be as bad as it was. \r\n\r\nSuperman IV has a ridiculous plot that was too grand on scale for its low budget, but it had potential. The film at least made a lot of nice attempts that sounded great on paper, but just weren't executed well. For that reason, I enjoyed this more than Superman III because Superman IV was a Superman film, a movie with a lot of ambition which I can respect even with the tragic results. Superman III was a boring, lame, uninteresting film from the get-go with only a handful of fine scenes, and left you empty handed at the end. Superman IV manages to be more memorable because of its unforgettable cheese and awfulness which is a plus for me over an uninteresting, side-tracked (cause of Richard Pryor), silly film like Superman III. Superman IV for me will always be one of the ultimate guilty pleasures.",

I'm struggling to vote it as the worst superhero movie ever but I think Batman and Robin still takes the cake, followed by Catwoman.  The only reason this doesn't top the list is it was shot on a VERY cheap budget whereas Batman and Robin cost $100 million.  That being said, I can't believe Reeve did this movie when he found out about the massive budget cut days before shooting. \nThe only alluring appeal about this movie is that it would be a great MST3K movie.",

            "content": "This film struggles to reach the standard of the other films but most of its flaws where archived during post production. the first significant change is the opening credits which are not only different in design but look poor as well. With most superman special effects the low level flight was very good but high level flight looks like poor cut and paste or the same shoot used endlessly. FX clean up is very sloppy here as well with most scenes still showing wires or new york logos. Putting aside the choppy editing the original length of this film was 45 mins longer. Which gave us the build up to disasters, and a obsession between nuclear man and the newspapers daughter. Along with failed nuclear man attempts. Its not all bad the double date is fun and so is the gym scene but a make over is what this film needs with the 45 min cut restored the inclusion of new flight sequences and opening credits. And we might have a film that Christopher envisioned.",

            "content": "From reading all the comments one must agree no matter how die hard Superman they are, is that the effects were very cheap and unrealistic indeed also the intro of the film didnt give the viewers the level of anticipation and excitement as the other 3 movies. The movie budget of $17 million is mainly responsible for this disaster. Also the movie in my view felt short and something things were missing from it as it didnt went to explain how some things took place. It looked like a rushed project. But i guess it does show the love interest between Superman and lois and lacy and Clark. Perhaps with a much bigger budget and using a well developed script, fans and critics would have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Nevertheless, any Superman follower or worshipper would still enjoy this film for what its worth.",
