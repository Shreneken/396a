The movie only has one real major flaw which is a romance subplot that doesn't feel necessary. I feel this movie could have been perfect had this subplot been taken out or given much less screen time. The first act can be tough to get through because the most interesting aspect of the story is given less screen time for about an hour. However, once the movie shifts gears it is excellent. I found myself eagerly waiting to see what would happen next and was thoroughly entertained. This is a very fun movie that fans of the heist genre should definitely check out.",

In fact you may get nostalgic while watching ten rupee notes printed in black ink, 'gaddi' style offices, 'aangan' centric homes, Air India airplanes and sparsely decorated airport lounges.\n\nThe movie is about false CBI raids by conmen imposing as CBI officers who are expert in seizing both apparent and hidden assets (money, jewelry etc.). Everyone has acted well in the film. But Manoj Bajpai needs special mention for his remarkable performance. His entry is rather late, but his histrionics are unbeatable. Like Aamir Khan, every time he performs a pivotal character, he manages to bring something new on the table. Akshay has pretty well underplayed his character. But the kind of superstar he is, you constantly miss what you always expect him to deliver i.e. glitzy romance and action!\n\nIn such an intense and interesting movie, you feel impatient when more than the required movie time (read plenty) is allotted to display the personal simple lives of the conmen. That part is neither interesting nor different. Also you fail to understand the purpose of the same. Con activities are both sinful and illegal. So, why the director has tried to generate public sympathy for the aforesaid conmen by displaying their emotional and family side?",

            "content": "Special 26 is a one of its kind con-job Indian Movie which has everything in place, including its entertainment value. This heist drama is a surprise and has really met the expectation from the 'A WEDNESDAY' Director, Neeraj Pandey. A Master Mind, 26 people and a mantra ' Asli Power Dil Mein Hoti Hai (the real  power lies in the heart)' has created magic on the silver screen that you will relish .\n\nSpecial 26 is inspired from the true incidents  of 1980s where few people posed themselves as CBI Officers has raided many politicians and businessmen across the nation but most of them never published in the newspaper due to the involvement of Black money. This movie's  last heist drama is inspired by the 1987's real life robbery at the Opera House Branch of TBZ jewellers in Mumbai by the fake CBI officers.\n\nSpecial 26 is a story of  Ajay Singh (Akshay Kumar) who wished to a CBI officer but unfortunately he couldn't make out in the interview. Later on  with the help of three people  Sharmaji (Anupum Kher), Joginder (Rajesh Sharma) and Iqbal (Kishore Kadam) he blueprint a Plan which no one has ever imagined in the history. They heist 49 people posing as CBI Officers without getting caught so they plan for the 50th and the Final Master Game. But four of them alone cannot do the same , they need a team of 26 people, their own Special 26. Will they get their Special 26? Will they succeed in their Master Plan?\n\nNeeraj Pandey , the Director, first and foremost along with his creative team should be applauded for the cinematic magic they have shown to portrait the India of 1980s. Very few Indian Movies actually put a thought and labour like the way Neeraj has done whether it was the Miniature  Indian Airlines, Cars of the 1980s, Kolkatta Market, Connaught Place, Traffic and roads of Delhi It was really hard to believe that movie has been made in 2012-13. Second,  The story and screenplay  is intelligently written and the climax is mind boggling ( with one flaw  Vidya Balan's Kahaani is still the best of Indian Cinema). Third, the Characters are well written especially Jimmy Shergill and Divya Dutta were the real surprise.  Fourth, Performances are top notch from all the characters including the supporting ones. Fifth, Background score and  music was really a surprise and appreciating. Neeraj has indeed has given one of the best of 2013.\n\n\nPerformances, Akshay Kumar for the first time has given a performance I would like to remember as far as acting quotient is concerned. Anupum Kher  needs no introduction and Manoj Bajpai has given the rock solid performances. As mentioned Jimmy Shergill and Divya Dutta were the surprise factor and all supporting cast has done a reasonably good job.\nMusic,  Background Score was a major strength and Music by M. M. Kareem and Himesh Reshammiya  was pretty good and lyrics by Irshad Kamil penned down  nicely.\n\n'Special 26' is the best movie so far in 2013 and is a gem of Con-Job movies in the Indian Cinema. Neeraj Pandey has given the enough reason to the audience to celebrate Cinema ONLY IN THEATRES!\n\n' Asli Power Dil Mein Hoti Hai'\n  \nRegards \nYour's AvA\nFounder :TheCritiqueLab.com\nReaders' Feedback is appreciated",

            "content": "During the 1980s, the advent of wealth indicators such as televisions, Marutis, Fiats, Bajaj scooters and gold was partly attributed to the growth of substantial black money among politicians, businessmen and celebrities. Such wealth always brought with it the risk of exposure leading to the CBI and IT officials being viewed with trepidation. One con man, along with his partners, took advantage of this fear and conducted a series of intricately planned raids in the name of those agencies. \nDirector Neeraj Pandey ('A Wednesday') tackles an intelligent subject after his acclaimed debut thriller and lives up to the promise of his distinct talent. Special 26 is a witty entertainer, based on true events in the same period and has its bases well covered with superlative performances by its actors, a credible, chronological script and screenplay with adroit direction that keeps the momentum under control between the seriousness, suspense and fun. \n\tAjay (Akshay Kumar) intricately plans the raids and executes them rapidly, covering every detail and improvising spontaneously with his accomplices that include Iqbal (Kishore Kadam), Joginder (Rajesh Sharma) and of course, the brilliant Anupam Kher. Their first raid humiliates Inspector Ranvir Singh (Jimmy Shergil) who supported it unknowingly, thus leaving him distraught and determined to apprehend them. He passes on leads and information to a real CBI official who approaches the case in a diligent, critical manner with focused tenacity. Manoj Bajpai as Wasim Khan is the formidable force that can disrupt all those intricately planned heists and while they're made aware of their fake raid making it to the news, Ajay plans one big raid at a jeweler in Bombay by recruiting 26 more 'CBI interns'. Little does he know that Wasim Khan is a step ahead of his plan..... or is he really?\n\tNeeraj Pandey depicts the screenplay at a racy pace except for the occasional romantic escapade involving Ajay and Priya (Kajal Agarwal). Pandey's attention to detail is conspicuous in almost every scene with regards to the vehicles, structures, fashion and background score. But the film's strengths are its well directed storyline and the performances by its A-list of actors. While the director manages the balance between the seriousness of a raid and its fun result, the actors have their own fun portraying varying shades of themselves within moments in the screenplay. \nSpecial 26 could not have come at a better time for Akshay Kumar. Just when all his films started looking the same and his role in them hackneyed, along comes a genre in which he excelled ('Hera Pheri', 'Aankhein'). As a lead con man, his dedication and sincerity result in a convincing portrayal of the character while there is a complete lack of other nonsense that he has subjected his fans to recently, including item songs, jarring dialogues and ridiculous action. \n\nManoj Bajpai plays a character that is yet distinct for an actor of his caliber, which in itself is remarkable. His ferocity in a chase sequence, composure while being in a commanding situation and natural reaction to adversity are notable traits in his laudable performance. \nPandey maintains his conviction in one of India's finest actors, Anupam Kher, by casting him alongside Akshay Kumar and what a masterful delivery of versatility it was!\nHis dialogue delivery varies in tone and confidence as he appears as the CBI Officer P.K. Sharma and as the tense con man who fakes it all. He thus provides most of the humorous moments without having to jump around or being obtuse. \nAmong the supporting cast, Jimmy Shergill delivers an act so convincing that we all buy into his Inspector Ranvir Singh. Kadam and Sharma, as the other two accomplices are realistic actors for their roles whereas Tiku Talsania was at his comical, cheery best in a cameo.\n\tIn terms of MM Kreem's score, the Akshay Kumar sung Mujhme tu is soothing but breaks the fast paced screenplay. Gore Mukhde is a fine bhangra number, to be listened to on an evening drive along Carter Road. \n\tWith two critically and unanimously acclaimed films in his hat, Neeraj Pandey will have added pressure to deliver even better. Meanwhile, his team of Special 26 has achieved something that most films and film makers struggle with..... - Pure entertainment. \nThis one should not be missed.\n\n\t- 8.812 on a scale of 1-10.",

Anupam Kher is fabulous, and so is Jimmy Shergill, but it's Manoj Bajpayee that takes the cake. What an actor he is! \n\nSpecial 26 could have been even better, only if it were a few minutes shorter, Pandey felt too obsessed with making people walk with camera in the front moving backwards.
