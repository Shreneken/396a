            "content": "Better than the original. I loved this movie based in the 70's and had fun watching things that were old-school for me. I watched it a few times and laughed out loud throughout. Not a fan of Ralphie's day dream scenes in the original and in this one, when re-watching I fast-forwarded over those scenes. SPOILER ALERT - One of the funniest 70's throwback scenes was at the local bar, patrons all enjoying a night at the bar when the bar phone rings and you could hear a pin drop. Bartender looks around asking if \"so-and-so\" is there, everyone shaking their head NO. So many things have changed with the death of the landline and this was one I hadn't thought about until I watched this charming movie.",

            "content": "As the considerable classic really set the low bar in terms of debatable enjoyment, it's actually an equivalent to a Christmas gone wrong thus cementing a bad memory except for parts you couldn't help but chuckle when thinking back. While this became a nostalgic edge for its surpassing 2012 sequel that assisted in brightening the enjoyment level, the truest sequel being the purest, whereas most of the original cast returns plus irreplaceably remembered, combines both its predecessors with glorified elements providing an improved connective balance between nostalgic and characterized appreciation. The characters are now likable by wit and hilarious delivery with unexpected warmth as the cast never lost touch of their iconic roles as they performed under improved sensible realization while refining a revival of something notably cherished that also revived the Christmas narrative formula that lessened in usage. Picking among the three that narrates in direct, canonical alignment, this is the best and nicer to watch, therefore strengthening the classic foundation in an acknowledged touching matter. (B+)",

It's a lazy, often uncomfortably unfunny retread of the original with almost none of the charm or wit. \n\nMinor spoilers ahead: \n\nAs it turns out, the parents mostly carried the first film, something I'd always suspected but now know for sure. (I still love every moment of the original; don't get me wrong.) And I'm not sure what I imagined Ralphie's childhood friends ending up doing with their lives, but getting pass-out hammered in a rundown dive bar every day definitely wasn't a guess. In fact, this film has a strange focus on binge drinking. I do realize it takes place in the 70s, but the constant boozing felt out of place and at odds with the chaste, wholesome vibes I expected. I'm no prude, but if I wanted to watch disenfranchised people drown their sorrows in cheap liquor and lament their disappointing lives, I'd go to Applebees. If I'm watching a follow up to a classic Christmas movie, I'm looking to get my heart warmed. \n\nI added a half star to the mandatory other half for the exactly one scene that got a laugh out of me or my three viewmates. Overall, this film added nothing to the original and didn't need to exist. Apparently the nostalgia factor is enough for some, but in my opinion that's hardly necessary for a film that to this very day plays around the clock on Christmas each year.",

It is fun to see all those kids grown up as a adult. Besides that, the story is very well written. Absolutely not boring and not corny. It is funny, touching and sentimental. My wife and I love it. We absolutely love it. I have to say that: if you love the original A Christmas Story, you have to see this and you will also love this one too. So forget the \"A Christmas story 2\". Throw it away. Keep the original \"A Christmas Story\" and this one \"A Christmas Story Christmas\" in your Christmas movie collection.

A Christmas Story Christmas is enjoyable all the way through and never feels too nostalgia-heavy. It truly does tell a great story about a man trying to step into his father's footsteps and make Christmas great as his father did for him. A true highlight of this movie was the car ride with Scut Farcus expanding on his story after the events of the original. The returning actors all did great, and they truly were the thing this film needed to go from good to great. A great Christmas flick and a must watch for Christmas Story fans",

            "content": "Review: A Christmas Story Christmas \n\nA Christmas Story Christmas is a genuine treat, a gift for those of us who have grown up with the beloved Bob Clark original. \n\nThe story - set in the early 70's - follows a grown Ralph Parker ( a returning Peter Billingsley, who assumes narration duties from Jean Shepherd, on whose writings the original was based) revisiting the familiar house on Cleveland Street with his wife and children after a phone call from his mother delivers extremely sad news:  The Old Man has passed away.\n\nThe rest of the film chronicles Ralph's efforts to give his family the same holiday experience the Old Man always seemed to do with ease, only to discover how infrequently it's as easy as it looked when he was a boy . Along the way he reunites with Schwartz, Flick and even his old bully Scott Farkus. \n\nMany people may not be aware of this but between television films, direct to video sequels and an unsuccessful theatrical sequel directed by Bob Clark himself, A Christmas Story Christmas is roughly the eighth project inspired by Shepherd's work. \n\nIt's also the best since A Christmas Story. What sets this film apart is the approach. This is as much a love letter to the original as it is a sequel and it really feels as if we're revisiting this charming cinematic world forty years on. \n\nThe cast is excellent across the board, with Billingsley providing a strong center.  It helps that the actors portraying Schwartz, Flick, Farkus and even Ralph's younger brother Randy were brought back to portray their older selves. It feels like a homecoming and that chemistry quickly reestablishes itself.\n\nIf there's one aspect of the film that's different, it's the structure. Though this movie still has a through line of comedy, it leans a bit more to the dramatic side of things than its predecessor, particularly in regards to dual subplots about both Ralph's attempt to write an epic science fiction novel and his struggle to find the correct words to summarize his father in an obituary. The way these two threads eventually dovetail is as sweet as it is rewarding. Expect to go through some emotions as the film unfolds. It's impressive how well those heart tugging scenes sneak up on the viewer. The moment Ralph learns of his Dad's passing is particularly potent as - for a moment - we see in Billingsley's face that same young boy who smiled lovingly at his father upon realizing the Old Man had come through with a Red Ryder BB gun all those years ago. \n\nThat said, the film does boast some genuinely funny moments. There are a few reasons for this.\n\nOne is the humor is relatable, only now it's relatable to those of us who grew up with the original because we're adults roughly the same age as Ralph and that's the perspective we experience Christmas from.\n\nAnother is the use of callbacks peppered throughout the film. A Christmas Story Christmas understands how to incorporate callbacks better than any movie I've ever seen. These are not cheap rehash moments. These are functional, such as years of resentment over the  tongue on the frozen pole schoolyard incident leading to an all new challenge being presented or the fact that Ralph still tends to drift into daydreams even as an adult ( an early example set in a publisher's office is very, very funny) .\n\nBut if there's a singular point from which the real comedic genius of this film originates, it has to be Julie Hagerty, who takes over the role of Ralph and Randy's mom from Melinda Dillon ( who retired from acting in 2007).\n\nHonestly, I was concerned when  I read Hagerty was in this. I enjoyed her in the Airplane! movies, but Melinda Dillon was one of the best things about A Christmas Story. I wasn't sure Hagerty was a good fit.\n\nI needn't have worried. Not only does the actress deliver the goods when the story calls for her to be serious, Hagerty proves she still has excellent comic timing and delivery, aided by a screenplay that allows her to be at times endearingly condescending or, alternately, delightfully weird.  She and Billingsley are the MVP's here without question. The scene where we find out what they really think about Christmas carolers is brilliant. \n\nI've been sick for a day or two having apparently caught something over the Thanksgiving holiday and I wasn't feeling well when I got around to watching A Christmas Story Christmas.  Despite that, by the time the end credits began to roll, I was grinning from ear to ear and I felt really good inside.\n\nThis is an excellent, honorable legacy sequel. It won't replace A Christmas Story, but it will earn a place next to it as part of my annual holiday veiwing line up moving forward. It's really rewarding to see someone still knows how to make a warm, funny holiday film that bears the message family, friends and above all love are what's most important. In this cynical age, that's a breath of fresh air. \n\nIn embracing its gentle and nostalgic soul, A Christmas Story Christmas proves that even decades later, you really can go home again.\n\n****1/2 out of ***** \n\n- D. S. Ullery\n\n#AChristmasStoryChristmas",

It was so great to see Peter Billingsley as Ralphie again, but the other actors, especially Zack Ward as Scut Farkus really sealed the deal.  It could have gone wrong in so many ways but the scenes between the two characters made the film in my opinion.  And while I would have loved to have seen Melinda Dillon back as Mother Parker, Julie Hagerty was well cast as her replacement.  All in all, this as a good film, and while there will never be a 24 hour marathon, it arrived just when we needed it.  Let's just forget about all of those other sequels, okay?",

Subtle call backs, and returning cast members that only dreams are made of.  Notable absences are Darren McGavin - deceased both here and there (The Old Man Parker) and Melinda Dillon - retired from acting (Mother Parker).  Two key characters that would have made this gem, perfect!  Peter Billingsley narrates and stars, once again, as 'Ralphie'.  The old neighborhood is quiet and peaceful until the boy with big eyes, glasses and bigger dreams returns to honor his recently departed dad in throwing the greatest christmas celebration of all time!  Warm tidings bring chills of anticipation, tears of joy and gut-busting laughter!  Thank you Warner Bros..  Thank you Peter.  Thank you one and all!",

I love the old-time (1940's) nostalgia of the original - the snowy street, the old Victorian family home - all the best of when times were simpler. So, this past weekend, my husband, 11-year-old-son and I made it a movie night: we watched the first A Christmas Story for the first time this year (probably our hundredth time watching it overall!) and then immediately followed it up by watching A Christmas Story Christmas. I have to say, I was so relieved it was as good as it was! We all really enjoyed it. The writing was good, the acting was good, the comedy was enjoyable, and the nostalgia and magic of the season were still there (in the 1970's). My one gripe./disappointment was that the original actress who played Ralphie's mom wasn't in this new movie; how wonderful would it have been if she could have been persuaded out of retirement to return just for this?!? The ending was the best part and really tied this movie up beautifully with the first. Definitely a feel-good movie that I think will also become regular Christmas movie viewing for years to come!",

It is a holiday tradition.\n\nSequels, on the other hand, are hard to pull off and have a lot to live up to. A Christmas Story Christmas has proven the old maxim, \"You can't go home again,\" by literally attempting to do that very thing.\n\nWith the exception of them being older, nothing has changed on Cleveland Street after thirty-three years (outside of the old man's passing). And that's the problem. Even that life-altering event doesn't stop them from being holly jolly. All mom has to say is your father wouldn't want you to be sad; so let's enjoy Christmas and that's pretty much it.\n\nSo, in lieu of mourning the patriarch's death, they go by Higbees to see the store window, and inside the Santa exhibit is exactly the same. The Bumpuses still have the hound dogs. The visit to the tree lot is mandatory, they sing Jingle Bells in the car (though it's the Batman version because it's 1973, so that's change). The old man dying is a macguffin so they can revisit the old haunts and old stories.\n\nI realize that for nostalgia buffs this is just fine. But thirty-three years have passed and old haunts usually close or are not there anymore. And old stories have already been told. And while the original movie revolved around the world of kid-dom at Christmastime, and that made it magical and wonderful, kids grow up, and \"things get complicated when you get past eighteen\u2026.\"\n\nPersonally, I would have liked to have seen Higbees turned into a casino (which it is IRL) with a Santa exhibit with showgirls or maybe it winds up in a state of decline (no more store window display and a meager Santa exhibit), maybe the Bumpuses win the lottery and move away and a hippie commune moves in next door. You know, things that show the passage of three decades.\n\nAs far as the old man dying at Christmas, c'mon. At least set it up where it is a year after the old man's death and since you hardly celebrated Christmas at all last year (you know, because your dad died), this year you're gonna go all out.\n\nWith so many homages and flashbacks I was tempted to just pop my DVD in and watch the original. The story, for the most part, was flat. It picks up towards the end but I was left feeling like young Ralphie when Miss Shields gives him a C+ on his theme.\n\nA Christmas Story Christmas did have some good moments (the best being the well placed homage in the last scene - bravo).\n\nHowever, just like the passing of the old man, after one viewing I think I'll be closing the lid on A Christmas Story Christmas and letting it rest in peace.

Its also nice that they were able to get most of the cast back. It made me miss the old man and his wise cracks, buts its a more than worthy sequel to a classic.

However, if he doesn't get published before the year is over, he'll go back to the grindstone in 1974. With only 5 days before Christmas, the family makes the trip from their home on the south side of Chicago to Ralphie's old home in Hohman, Indiana where Ralphie is deputized by his mother to take over the Christmas planning. Bearing the weight of the stress of waiting to hear back from a publisher before the year's out and taking over Christmas duties, Ralphie and his wife Sandy (Erinn Hayes) do their best to navigate the pitfalls they must continually overcome until Christmas day. Let's be honest, it's nearly impossible to recreate the magic the original 1983 film accomplished as it's such a revered film, but this is a very touching sequel that stands on its own and doesn't besmirch it's predecessor. The role of Ralphie's mom has been recast from Melinda Dillon to Julie Hagerty but outside of that, everyone else has reprised there roles and there are a number of cameos. I'm confident in saying the world didn't need a sequel to A CHRISTMAS STORY as the original is ageless, but this is a worthy enough follow-up.",

And its as if they told her \"just play your character from Airplane again.\" The mother in the original was not a ditzy klutz. \n\nThere is no real energy or fun to be found. And many of the jokes seem like they just wanted to get them in the can and shot them all in one lazy take.\n\nI just don't get why movies feel so lazy and flat these days. What the frick is going on? \n\nHave people completely forgotten the exciting and crayz things we all experience in life, in-which makes a story fun and interesting? \n\nIts like no one has anything important to say anymore so they just go through the motions and making movies is just a job for many now.\n\nIt feels like a Hallmark movie that happens to involve the family from A Christmas Story. \n\nIt wastes time showing Ralphie be nostalgic just to make you nostalgic when they should have just continued his life story and had fun with it, making up memorable scenes along the way.

            "content": "Admittedly, my bar was in the basement for this movie, but I was truly surprised by how moved I was by it. If you were in an \"A Christmas Story\" family like I was growing up - and that movie is wrapped up in your version of that childhood concept of Christmas that you lose somewhere along the way - this movie will speak to you.\n\nWhat I really appreciated is that this movie is honest; it may occasionally try, but this isn't \"A Christmas Story,\" and the movie knows it. The childhood magic and fantasy of Christmas transforms into a labor of love in adulthood, and this movie is about how Ralph (yeah, he's \"Ralph\" now... except to those who know him best) has an incredible labor ahead of him. And yet, just like Ralph still indulges in the occasional dissociative fantasy, we can still find moments to indulge in the fantastical pieces of Christmas in between budgeting for gifts and cleaning up the pine needles, no matter how old we are.\n\nFor many (most?) adults, Christmas joy becomes intermingled with Christmas sorrow at some point. You will have a particularly bad Christmas one year. You will notice who is missing. You will be disappointed in someone you love, or maybe they will be disappointed in you. \"A Christmas Story Christmas\" makes all of that clear, but it also makes clear that we can honor that sorrow while still finding ways to live in wonder and cheer. We just have to choose it.\n\nI wouldn't leave it on my TV for 24 hours on Christmas day, but I do recommend it for any other day of the Christmas season.\n\nA few other, more random thoughts: The bulk of the original cast is here again, sometimes in unexpected places. There are definitely moments where these characters are doing what they do for the nostalgia, or they're bringing closure to something we've already moved on from, or they're here just because, but I'm honestly glad so many of them are here again.\n\nMrs. Parker is the only character who has been recast. Julie Hagerty replaces Melinda Dillon in the role, and she was quite good. The differences are certainly noticeable - the script leans in to Hagerty's comedic chops - but it works perfectly well, and you will still probably have to look at her for a minute to really notice the difference at the start of the movie.\n\nThere are many sendups to the original, and though they feel somewhat silly at times (Ralph the Man still publicly engages in maladaptive daydreaming in front of other people while Flick and Schwartz are still triple-dog-daring one another), I think they work well. They lend themselves nicely to the tone of the film and feel pretty organic; again, this movie is pretty self-aware, so most of these are tongue-and-cheek references. That said, they're not overdone; they enhance the story, but they don't carry it.\n\nAlso, this is a reminder that his name is actually \"Scut,\" not \"Scott.\"",

            "content": "A Christmas Story Christmas is the highly anticipated and long-awaited follow-up to the classic Christmas movie, A Christmas Story. It's full of new and old faces and, of course, plenty of hilarious scenes. This movie certainly gets you ready for the holiday season.\n\nPeter Billingsley returns as Ralphie in A Christmas Story Christmas. He's back and all grown up, and tries to give his kids a magical Christmas, just like the ones he had when he was younger. But with an unexpected loss, he must do it by himself. Can he live up to his dad's standards and give his kids the perfect Christmas?\n\nAs the title suggests, this movie is the sequel to A Christmas Story, nearly 40 years in the making! It isn't necessary to watch the original movie to make sense of this one; however, there are references to the original movie that may be a bit confusing for those who haven't viewed it. Also, A Christmas Story is one of my favorite Christmas movies and is a joy to watch, so I do recommend it before watching this one if possible. One of my favorite parts of this movie is the fact that most of the original cast members play their same characters. Flick (Scott Schwartz), Schwartz (R. D. Robb), Randy (Ian Petrella), and even Scut Farkus (Zack Ward) all make an appearance. It is surreal (in a good way) to see what these former childhood actors now look like all grown up. I've never searched for their current appearances, so they are all a pleasant surprise. I also love how the sequel stays true to the original movie with all the sets, transitions and personalities of the characters. The narration is even similar to the first movie. Peter Billingsley, on top of just acting in this movie, also co-wrote and produced it. Kudos to him for all the work he did to bring us this movie. Speaking of some of the actors, my favorite performances are from Peter Billingsley (Ralphie), Julie Hagerty (Ralphie's mom) and Erinn Hayes (Sandy). Peter Billingsley keeps all his mannerisms and quirks from Ralphie even in his adult years, which makes this movie feel familiar and comedic. Julie Hagerty replaces Melinda Dillon as Ralphie's mom, and she fills her shoes so well. Erinn Hayes plays the newly introduced character Sandy and fits right in. She makes me feel as if she has been there forever because of the amusing interactions she has with other characters. The actors have so much chemistry, no doubt due to the fact that most of them have known each other for so long.\n\nThe primary message of A Christmas Story Christmas is that sometimes, it's the thought (and effort) that counts. This movie also deals with the loss of loved ones. There is some mild profanity and consumption of alcohol.\n\nI give A Christmas Story Christmas 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18, plus adults. Fans of original movie will enjoy this movie as well as those who are unfamiliar with the original. It comes on HBO Max November 17, 2022. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!",

I never thought we'd get to see these characters again in any meaningful way, but the wait was worth it.  Billingsley falls right back into the beloved Ralphie so seamlessly and is so rootable from the very first scene.  Erinn Hayes is also fantastic, as are the kids, and Julie Hagerty is a more than fitting replacement for Melinda Dillon.  While I'm sure it will be mostly fans of the first film who will be watching, it is just a great Christmas movie in general.  Very rewatchable too.",

If they were ever going to make a sequel to the original film, this was the best way to do it. While not as funny as the first, it's surprisingly moving. I can't stress enough how earnest and sincere it is. 8/10 from this lifelong fan. The last couple minutes were a wonderful way to both end things and bring them full circle.",

The movie was so touching and an amazing tribute to \"the old man Darren McGavin. Sadly, My mom passed away on 12/21/2018, and growing up, just like the old man, she didn't just adore Christmas, as Ralphie says, she INDULGED in it. I cried nearly half a dozen times throughout the movie every time Ralph thought of his dad and the memories. In all honesty, Christmas for my family died when she did. After watching this movie though, I think it's time we stopped mourning over her passing especially around the time of year when she passed, but celebrate her life! Remember all our memories and stories of my beautiful and loving, caring mother, and how she would bring Christmas to life every single year. I've been dreading Christmas time since 2018, but, for the 1st time since that day, I can easily say I'm excited for Christmas and to celebrate her life. Thank you so much Peter Billingsley, Julie Hagerty and the entire cast of ACSC!!! Truly a wonderful job on this sequel which I think deserves to be up there and mentioned with the original, and heck even played for 24 hours straight on Christmas Eve/Day. \nSincerely from a lifelong fan of the Franchise, \n                  Gregg Burdash",
