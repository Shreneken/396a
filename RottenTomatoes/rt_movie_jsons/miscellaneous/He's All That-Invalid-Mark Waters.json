In short, it is a spectacularly failed attempt at money-grabbing.",

In my opinion, I think they directors should have picked a better cast, not tiktokers who are known to create 30 seconds long morning routine and unrealisted reality shows. \n\nnot only the fact that the actors were doing a bad job, but also how the storyline was created. it was super cheesy and extremely unpredictable. It seemed that the whole movie was really rushed, and there was no suspense created whatsoever. If I'm being honest, the further more I watch this movie, the less intrested I had in watching it, I think that the directors could have done a better job at that.",

They joke throughout the movie about his aversion to technology being a character flaw but they're not wrong at all about that. His affinity for Kurosawa/Kubrick films was a trait made up by a person that writes screenplays. They deadass gave him an \"I don't care about money\" line 20 seconds after he declared he'd been gifted an entire photography darkroom at age 14. His affection for horses is incongruous with the rest of his personality and him spending hours with them BEFORE school, as a misanthrope who hates being there, is absolutely not believable as it means that on top of everything else, he goes to bed incredibly early. There's also a strangely out-of-place effort to include a goth NB character that initially came off as lip service but turned out to just be an intentionally poor representation of that community, like the time when a national news team came & interviewed people in my rural town about a tornado & picked the person with the thickest southern accent to represent us on TV.

It captured the zeitgeist of the 90s so well, along with playing to and creating the teen romcom format. So, with this remake, what I thought would be a disaster, ends up being a not so bad watch. Using the same formula as the original, the movie switches the makeover to a \"loser\" guy, and changes the bets reasoning a little too. With some questionable dramatic acting, the movie gets its strength from actually doing a fairly good job of playing into the dynamic the lead pair have romantically, and the silliness that comes with doing things for social media. Addison Rae is not a trained actress and it shows. But, she surprisingly does an okay job, considering this is her first big role. Its when she shares screen time with Tanner Buchanan that she really shows her possible acting abilities. Its nice to see the original star Rachael Leigh Cook in an extended role, and Matthew Lillard in a role as well. The other supporting characters are actually well performed, which helps elevate the movie from mediocrity. In terms of recent remakes, this isn't the worst but certainly isn't the best. Its a passable watch!",

The call backs to the original are fun, but the movie doesn't work well with the male lead being overly emotional.  I think it is in the writting that misses the nuances of the Laney character from She's All That.  In that film Laney needed and wanted validation from the outside world (her art teacher, the improv group, her family), she just convinced herself she didn't.  In this film Cameron shuns the outside world completely.  He has so little desire to let it in that he starts to teach the female lead to do the same.  It doesn't work, but Tanner Buchanan does a very good job.",

The rest of it is completely cringe-worthy and a real task to get through. The movie is mercifully short but at no point did I find myself invested in the story. The characters are selfish and mean-spirited and I didn't really want to root for anyone. The movie plays out exactly how I expected it but with completely bad writing and acting. Addison Rae might be successful on TikTok but it doesn't mean she can act in an actual movie, and unfortunately, this movie isn't the best sales pitch for her. She comes off as emotionless in most moments and I didn't buy any emotions her or anyone else was trying to convey. Overall, this is one of those movies that is so laughably bad, it honestly might be worth checking out to watch ironically if you want to cringe for an hour and a half.",

That's where the plot and the rest of the acting of the movie this is obviously not supposed to be an Emmy winning film. It's a teenage chick flick. And it does a damn good job of being that.

Although, with a few classes, she might not actually do too badly in the movie world. This movie was mostly so so for me. The humor was mostly cheap. The acting definitely could have been better for certain characters. The story was a mostly failed remake of another teen classic. For me the original has already always been a \"watch just because it doesn't take too much focus\" kind of film. I'd say, give it a go if you're a fan of \"She's All That,\" but don't expect it to be an amazing experience, that you'll want to rewatch over and over again.

            "content": "I'm sure there aren't too many who consider 1999's She's All That a great film, or even a great high school comedy film, but I know there are fans and I know nobody was clamoring for a Netflix gender-swap remake starring one of Tik Tok's most famous users. We didn't need the original but it was a mildly amusing version of My Fair Lady, or its older inspiration Pygmalion, set in the superficial class system of an American education system. It came out during the heyday of 90s teen cinema remaking older literary concepts (Ten Things I Hate About You) and made short-lived careers for stars Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook. My amazement is Netflix rehiring the same writer, R. Lee Fleming Jr., now 50-something, and asking him to remake his twenty-year-old hit for the voice of Generation Z (It's not even like \"all that\" has held up in slang parlance). This movie feels every bit the dismal corporate-sponsored, cash-grabbing, star vehicle that it is. Nobody in Generation Z cared about She's All That, and now very few will really care about He's All That.\n\nThis time we follow Padgett Sawyer played by Tik Tok star Addison Rae (83 million followers in real life!). Padgett is a high school senior who has millions of online followers who hang onto her every word of advice. She uses her position as an influencer to even help pay the bills at home to relieve her overworked mom (Rachel Leigh Cook, not the same character) and maybe pay for her college. She live streams catching her boyfriend cheating, loses her cool, and becomes a meme thanks to an unfortunately timed snot bubble. Now she has to earn back those lost followers and her respect or else she might not still maintain her ascendant social media standing and pay for school. Her catty friend challenges her to makeover a loser guy at school and the hopeless case ends up being Cameron Kweller (Tanner Buchanan), a sarcastic, arty loner who wears a beanie and has long hair (a wig) and rides horses and practices karate. What a loser. She buddies up to Cameron and through that friendship she starts to question her own sense of self and learns what's really important as she physically changes this guy to be more acceptable to a mainstream opinion of people she'll never meet in real life. Or something like that.\n\nThe inordinate influence of social media is a very worthwhile avenue to explore for modern satire as a means of separating this He's All That from its predecessor and making it relevant. The problem with He's All That is that the movie refuses to go very deep or hard-hitting with this topic because it's also meant to be a vehicle for fame to launch the feature acting career of Rae. I'll fully admit, dear reader, that I had no idea who Rae was until watching this movie and I don't really get the appeal (more on her acting ability later). In this movie, Padgett is obsessed with maintaining her carefully curated online image, a ruse that relies upon a fantasy that no human being could adequately maintain. She wakes up and goes through an entire routine of makeup and hair styling before she records herself \"just waking up.\" It reminded me of a joke from the fabulous TV series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel where the title character makes sure her husband never fully sees her in the morning how she actually looks. It was funny then because it commented on the pressure of wives in the 1950s, let alone those from Jewish families, to live up to an impossible beauty standard to appeal to the man's comforts and desires. With He's All That, it really becomes the last joke at the expense of our main character. The movie is too afraid to delve any deeper for fear of directing negative attention toward its star and her influencer ilk. It even conveniently sets up the good of her position, what with her able to pay some bills. She can't be all bad, you'll say, because she's helping her mom. I guess we like social media facades now.\n\nPadgett's plight really doesn't make much sense in the context of the movie. She's dropped perhaps a fifth of her many followers after the embarrassment of her public breakup with her louche of a boyfriend, a wannabe recording artist. First off, I don't know why this personal incident would be so detrimental to her character. Her boyfriend was clearly bad, she stood up for herself, and I would think that would only make people like her more and draw more followers to her brand. The only reason she has to worry is because we've awkwardly included Kourtney Kardashian and an even bigger social media influencer. I don't know why we have a Kardashian here, and I don't know why she doesn't merely play herself, unless that too would be another example of striking too close to home with the satirical depictions. Regardless, Padgett is worried she'll have to, gasp, potentially take out student loans for college. She believes that picking someone to grant a makeover would get back lost followers, which makes some sense, but then her friend also elects to make a personal bet about selecting some campus schlub and turning them into a heartthrob. Why does our main character need two motivating forces for why she agrees to participate in this bet? It's needlessly extra for a movie with so little else going on.\n\nAnother fault is that there is no chemistry between our leads, which kills the investment in any romantic comedy. The two actors are not a good fit from the beginning, and this comes down to two factors, the underwritten characterization and the limited acting ability of Rae. It was a joke in Not Another Teen Movie, a not-so-great spoof over those popular 90s/early 2000s teen comedies, that the thing separating the obviously beautiful girl from \"plain Jane\" territory was merely glasses and a ponytail. Cameron is already an appealing guy so when he gets his big physical transformation it's really just scrubbing off stubble dust and removing the beanie. His character, a self-described outsider, would be unlikely to be seduced by the wiles of popularity. There's also precious little to be uncovered with the character of Padgett, so the movie can't even have Cameron fall for Padgett as he realizes she isn't like his preconceived notions. There's no heat or sizzle or any point of intrigue between these two that would compel an audience to root for their eventual coupling. Cameron, we're told, like \"Kurosawa, Kubrick, and kung-fu movies,\" and he's basically the gender reverse of a shallow rendition of a manic pixie dream girl who is ultimately just there to get the protagonist to stop and appreciate life and then sublimate their own interests and desires to that of the protagonist. This is a romance where you root for irrevocable heartbreak.\n\nRae might be an overall pleasant presence but she's not quite there in the acting department yet. Her limited range really dampers many of the dramatic moments. Her line readings are extremely monotone. There are moments where I thought she was just going to smile her way through a scene. There were several scenes where I was convinced they could only have filmed two takes because this had to be the best one by default. I don't want to pile on Rae. I don't know the woman and she's only twenty years old and this is only one role. Except He's All That has also clearly been tailored for her and she cannot live up to these standards at this time. There's an egregiously long dance battle at the prom that goes on forever just to take advantage of Rae's dance skills from her Tik Tok dances. It's the same kind of contortion done to make room for Buchanan's (Cobra Kai) martial arts skills with a silly fight with Padgett's ex-boyfriend.\n\nIf I was overly cynical, I would estimate that the producers of He's All That sought an older IP that might still have some pull with an older audience that could be stripped down to its parts and slapped together with a formula that could platform its young stars while also barely hitting that 80-minute feature running time requirement. Except that sounds exactly like what's happened with He's All That as well as the preponderance of product placement. This entire movie is a cynical enterprise. It's not funny at all. It feels completely inauthentic with its portrayal of modern teenagers and social media lifestyles and even the appeal provided by a social media following of fans giving instant validation to every coordinated effort to be your phony best self. The director is Mark Waters, a man who helmed Mean Girls, the 2003 Freaky Friday, and the dark indie comedy The House of Yes. He has talent. He knows how to shoot a comedy. He knows that not every scene needs to be overly lit like night and shadow have no meaning and it all looks so cheap. While watching He's All That, you're left with the strong impression that everyone should know better, and you should know better than spending 80 tepid minutes of your time watching this cynical exercise.\n\nNate's Grade: D",

In the original you could really feel Laney and Zack bonding. The whole 'visual arts' scene took time to visualise how they grew more comfrertable with each other. THIS films take on that was a very short horse riding scene that just left us feeling empty, there was something but they just made everything happy and moved on (ALSO may have something to do with acting. \n-The writting just not good. just cheesy in the worst way.\n-And Idk y everyone is saying Kourtney was the best part next to her Addison could be an oscar nomnee. Her part was JUST painfull to watch.\n\nGood\n-End credits, i genunly think the end credits were the best part in anon-backhanded way. It was bloopers and stuff and basiclly real emotion that SHOULD have been in the actual movie\n-When Brin convinces Camron to go to prom, I think this was the ONE film that held up to its original (Laney's dad convinces her) it showed emotion and was moving, something the film all in all lacked\n\nOverall, not a film you would watch twice. Addison Rae ISN'T as bad as everyone is saying and if you want to watch it wont be the worst thing you have watched. If ur a huge fan of the original Im sorry but nothing could have compared anyways.

Another thing I love about her being in the movie is that both she and Mathew Liliard starred in the original She's All That.\nKourtney Kardashian is actually in the movie to the squeals and delights of her Instafollowers.\nFans of the original She's All That will spot some fun Easter eggs.\nThe dance scene was completely random but fun.\nPeyton Meyer does a great job playing a total douche.\nPre-teen girls are going to love this.\nKeep watching during the final rolling credits for some cute blooper clips.  All movies should have blooper reels.  \ud83d\ude42\n\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nSome really forced, cringe-worthy, bad acting moments.\nSuper cliched and predictable with a paint-by-numbers script.\nSoooo much blatant merchandising.\nI didn't feel any chemistry between the leads.\n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS:    \nShirtless guys\nScantily-clad girls\nKids swear, 1 F-bomb, and use of other crude language\nLesbians\nTalk of drugs\nTeens get tattoos\nKissing\nTeens cheating on each other\n\nYou can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",

I've been told she's some famous influencer on Tiktok.

I also found it strange that Addison was the main character and several characters with way more experience in this genre of acting had side roles. Overall Addison's acting was the most basic and fake thing I've seen. The movie was also extremely contradicting and there was no clear moral as all ideas juxtaposed each other. The plot could have used a lot of work, there was no real focus on it and all was forgiven like 2 minutes later. Overall a terrible movie",

I get that the storyline itself was meant to be a remake of the forever classic \"she's all that\", but honestly I think this one should of just remained an idea. The whole movie itself seemed rushed there was no suspense whatsoever no moments that had you on the edge of your seat everything was so predictable and overall lacked any wow factor. The further into the movie I got the more interest I lost,  I continued watching hoping that it would somewhat improve but was thoroughly disappointed by the unnecessary \"Dance Off\" and average acting. Don't get me wrong I get that they were trying to bring the movie in to the 21st century and incorporate social media and Today's issues in to the plot but overall it Was all just very poorly executed and felt very forced. The message behind the whole film is meant to be \"Don't Judge a book by it's cover\", type deal but there's no originality behind what they've made here I mean even with it being a remake and all there's still ways to bring different aspects to the film but unfortunately it was just another cliche \"Mean Girls\" Type Film. The cast themselves weren't completely terrible I've seen all of them in different Roles which they've portrayed perfectly. This movie was just a complete train wreck it had the potential to be great but was sorely let down with how terrible the storyline was written and played out. Nothing personal just wasn't big fan, not to say that others can't be, but I personally wouldn't go back to watch this film over and over again like I would with it's original Inspiration \"She's all that\".",

Every time Addison was talking I had to turn on my music or mute the device because I didn't want to listen to her. I'll admit everyone else in the movie was ok, and some did better than others. But that's because they actually were actors who have been in plays, tv shows, etc. However, Addison is only a Tiktok person coming into a business which in my opinion does not suit her. I know she is trying to branch out to other industries so she can not just rely on Tik Tok. Nevertheless, she can not act to save her life. So if you want to watch this movie go ahead. If you have the same reaction as me you can understand my point of view.\n(So Addison if you are reading this which I highly doubt. But this is my opinion of your movie).",

The cinematography was god-awful, and I do understand that it had a lower budget compared to other films today. However, I will not let that slip. The movie seems like it had a screenplay written by a guy with half a brain who never wrote anything past the first draft. My mother could have written better than this in 12 hours. This film is an absolute disgust to those who actually have talent and have a true desire to partake in movie-making. It's clearly a cash grab because a good chunk of the actors aren't talented, just well-known social media names. There was zero effort put into all of this. I wish I could un-watch the five seconds of this that I watched. I could also tell this was a cash grab because there was no effort put into the writing. This wasn't written by people with passion, it was written by lousy writers trying to make a quick buck. If I could, I'd give negative stars. For further explanation as to why the screenwriting was mediocre, aside from the below average level dialogue, the plot is centered around a Mary Sue like protagonist who's perfect at everything. She hardly has any issues and she seems like the type who's spoon-fed everything in life. None of us, and I mean none of us can relate to her. There's no emotional attachment between the audience and the characters. Please. To the screenwriters, the director, and the cast. Give up. To the producers, give up too. You guys funded a reboot or whatever of a film from the 90s that did horribly rating wise. Give your money to people who actually know how to invest it right. \ud83d\udc4e",

This was clearly just going to be another surface-level, fake and cringe teen drama that tried to be all noble about not being fake. On most count, it didn't stray away too much from its kind. \n\nHowever, it was actually not completely unbearable. I was surprised that I found some sweet and funny moments. Addison Rae was like alright and not completely cringe, even though her character, and also her character's friends were just normally fake people. \n\nWhen the premises started, I found some enjoyment, but of course at the end, the movie reverted completely back to normal. \n\nBut I talked a bit too much about this movie. Overall, it's just all that. 4.5/10",

I just don't think acting is in her career. \n\nOverall though I think it could have been way better.
