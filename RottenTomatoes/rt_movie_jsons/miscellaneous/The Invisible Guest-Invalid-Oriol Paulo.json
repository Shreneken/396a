There are numerous layers present in the plot and I found myself feeling like an armchair detective, as the saying goes, trying to second guess what may happen next, what may have led to the outcome being investigated. Its quite a good slow burner that I enjoyed, so I would recommend it.",

A successful business, being accused of murder, hired a defense attorney as both tried to figure out how to win the case. \n\nThe storytelling was mixed between the conversation and the flashbacks. The majority of the movie was just talking, and still it was an intense thriller because the attorney was trying to figuring out the whole story behind the businessman. \n\nAfter the first half, I was still curious because I wanted to see how this would end. I thought that I was picking up the clues, and had some ideas of how the story would end. Indeed, for most of the second half, there was a lot of twist and turn, and although some were expected, I felt intense and my ears were glued to their words. And when the final twist hit, I probably had the longest gape since the Red Wedding. I was completely fooled. It hit me so hard that I got emotional. \n\nOverall, this thriller mystery needed to be talked about more. I was still recovering from that ending when I was writing this review. 9/10",

But once the twist happens and is swiftly followed by another and then another, it reaches absurd levels that make it almost impossible to believe or take too seriously. Nevertheless, Oriol Paulo presents the proceedings with such aplomb and in such a dramatic manner that, despite them being somewhat ridiculous, they're still quite fun and satisfying to behold.",

            "content": "I must start off my review of The Invisible Guest by mentioning that this is a movie where I had to pause and rewind frequently. While I have become more adept at reading subtitles and have found many foregin language films enjoyable, this one had dialogue that was coming rapid-fire at times. I kept missing lines, and because it is a mystery, I was afraid of missing anything that might be a vital piece of information. This isn\u2019t a detriment to the film, but perhaps a warning for those who also have difficulty with reading subtitles that are only on the screen for a few seconds. Aside from that I was utterly enthralled by The Invisible Guest. The plot is written so well, and is constantly revealing new layers of the story as you go. Perhaps the smartest move they make is having every single flashback scene reflect what is being said, even if there is some falsehood in it. This allows us to revisit key moments from a new perspective when the main character revises his story. It\u2019s hard to say much about The Invisible Guest without spoiling things, but I can say that I thought the cast was amazing. There was a lot of emotion that came out in the performances we see here, and Mario Casas was particularly brilliant. He plays a heavily-layered character that is reluctant to put his guard down, so it\u2019s intriguing to see the stages he goes through in this film as he is forced to tell the truth. Ana Wagener is the other notable actor in the film. Her determination is perfect for the role, and it was great watching how she was always a step ahead of Casas in every scene. I will say that I started to suspect what is revealed at the very end somewhat early on, but as with all the best mysteries, even when you figure out one piece there is still more to discover. I can\u2019t say much more about The Invisible Guest for fear of spoiling things. I would highly recommend that all fans of mystery/thrillers give this movie a try. It was completely satisfying for me.",
