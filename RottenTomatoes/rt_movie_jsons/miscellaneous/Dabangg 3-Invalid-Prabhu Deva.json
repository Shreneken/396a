            "content": "I have this problem where if I start a series, I intend to watch the entirety of it. I fully expected \"Dabangg 3\" to be nonsense, and it was, but it was also super boring. I think if they made an hour and a half movie with over the top fight scenes and music, I could accept it for mindless entertainment. However, this is never the case with these movies. As always, there is an attempt to create emotions and a story and it fails spectacularly. The movie's story does not make any sense and the origin story aspect is a total snooze fest. The villain in this movie is given no depth whatsoever and is just a bad guy who does bad things. Overall, it is a movie that drags for two and a half hours and is truly the worst entry in one of the worst Bollywood series I have ever seen.",

I felt that the new romantic lead played by Saiee Manjrekar has a character so boring that I didn't even cared about her. It way less funny than the movie thinks it is.
