    "summary": "After avenging the death of his wife and young son at the hands of a vicious gang leader, Max (Mel Gibson) drives the post-apocalyptic highways of the Australian outback, fending off attacks from nomadic tribes that prey on outsiders. Falling into an encampment led by the relatively peaceful Pappagallo (Mike Preston), Max at first schemes to steal their oil, but soon becomes the group's reluctant defender against the hulking Humungus (Kjell Nilsson) and his ruthless marauders.",

            "content": "Magnificent, visceral, dystopian, post apocalyptic, dark and beautiful. Took the concept and look of cult hit Mad Max and improved every aspect. Truly memorable, unhinged performances abound (Gibson and Spence especially) and many legendary cult characters were immortalised. Stunts that seemed impossle even by today's standards were numerous - no CGI nonsense here. Pin sharp, tight direction and the definition of a lore that would spawn a whole sci-fi genre. Often copied but ironically only ever equalled once and that was by Mad Max Fury Road. The undisputable joint pinnacle of the genre but this did it first. \nThank you for an all time, absolute stone cold classic Mr George Miller.\n\"Fear is our ally. The gasoline will be ours. Then you shall have your revenge...\"",

            "content": "I am a big Mel Gibson fan, having seen most of his great works from the Lethal Weapon movies to Braveheart, etc. Having only recently watched and enjoyed Mad Max I was eager to see the sequel. I have seen this described as the best of the Mad Max movies and it's true. Superior to the original and a fine piece of cinematic art. In many respects, I like to think of Mad Max in a way that feels more like a prequel whereas this movie is the true first movie, with its tone matching the budget, as strikingly different. Kind of like Manhunter to Silence of the Lambs being different movies but in the same universe.\n\nYears have passed since Max Rockatansky surrendered living a normal life after the death of his family and as he surrendered so did the world. Originally it was the Oil crisis that span out of control turning the country lawless, but the war changed that, truly turning it into a dystopia, born out of the insanity of surviving in a world of diminished resources. The man known as Max Rockatansky died, it is only Mad Max the Road Warrior that takes his place. A man driven to revenge on the outlaws that killed his family, he survives by taking from the evil and saving the innocent, for a price of course. On a chance to make a living, he meets a group of good people hoarding fuel to create a civilized community all the while a savage gang wants their fuel and they will do everything they can to take it, including kill. But it is Mad Max who the good people are trusting and while the able Road Warrior is keen to earn his keep, the good people believe there is more to him than that. All this leads to a journey full of renewed purpose and an epic conclusion.\n\nI find it ironic that it took a greater budget to simulate a dystopia and a more memorable story with better actors to boot. Truly Mel Gibson shined brightly in his second turn as Mad Max, if the first movie was seeing a child walk, this was the equivalent of seeing the teenager win a gold trophy at a race. With this viewer the proud audience member watching. A true classic.",

George Miller brilliantly fleshes out his reluctant hero, Max, in this post Apocalyptic action film about gasoline as the most precious of commodities. Gibson is brilliant and engaging. The Direction and cinematography exceed that of films made 50 years later, with far less special effects. The violence and the visceral feel of the film are haunting. Joseph Campbell's impact on George Miller is not unnoticed. The supporting cast of quirky characters are marvelous. The chase scenes. The Music. The finished product is far greater than the sum of the parts. This film should be called The Road Warrior- because despite it being a sequel and part of a trilogy it stands alone. This is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Years after former policeman Max Rockatansky avenged the harrowing death of his wife and child, Australia finds its lands in post-apocalyptic ruins after a long fought nuclear war. Max now dubbed \"The Road Warrior\" wanders these highways in search of resources primarily sources of fuel. Thats when he stumbles upon a small gasoline refinery with a number of survivors fighting to maintain control of the compound and to remain alive. The brutal gang terrorizing the community is led by a bastard named The Humangus and his right hand Wez who plan to ransack the remaining fuel. Max agrees to help the survivors transport the gasoline across the highway to freedom. At first this is for selfish reasons but soon Max develops a soft spot for the people and vows to stop at nothing to help the people escape the clutches of the brutal band of savages. \n\nMad Max 2: The Road Warrior is definitively the best film of the Mad Max franchise and quite literally leaps and bounds better than the other two. Dare i call it the best post-apocalyptic action film ever made easily and basically every movie like it since has no doubt in some way been inspired by this epic film in some form or fashion. This film builds off of the first beautiful and everything they did well in the first one they do even better in the sequel. We get more fiery wrecks, more bloody deaths, and more than a few uncomfortable moments, what more could we ask for. As someone who took 40 years after it was released to finally check it out it sure as hell holds up and its just as amazing to me as i'm sure it was for anxious people back in the early 80's. We see a complete transformation of Max's character as he changes from a sort of loner to an absolute savior. The villains were simply fantastic in my eyes. There is no doubt this film is a timeless classic everyone needs to see at least once.",

I still think \"Fury Road\" blows these original movies out of the water, but it is interesting to see what the start of franchises like this looked like and truly appreciate how much has changed and improved.",

Is there anything more quintessentially Mad Max than that lineup? Following hot on the heels of 1979's low-budget original, The Road Warrior (as it was dubbed in America) ups the ante in every sense. Bigger and louder. More visually ambitious. Conceptually tighter, with taller fireballs, scrappier-looking vehicles and a more appropriate (read: super-speedy) pace. It's a solid '80s action movie, released when the world was still trying to figure out what, exactly, that meant.\n\nMax himself might say a dozen words from start to finish - the epitome of the strong, silent type - but his sawed-off shotgun speaks volumes and his grizzled exterior is betrayed by the guilty grin he has for two unlikely cohorts: a fiercely loyal stray dog and a feral, fur-clad young boy. The kid seems redundant, really, given how well Max's pairing with the dog works, but neither relationship feels force-fed or strained and they each have a slightly different role to play in the simple, no-frills story.\n\nNot that anyone is out for high art here. We're all after the crazy bondage outfits, the massive action sets and the twisted metal aftermath. Plenty of that to go around, especially in the quarter-hour of total, unhinged vehicular madness that concludes the whole ordeal. It's stupid and fun, visceral thrills with only the loosest of story beats; the bare minimum necessary to move us from one smoldering pileup to the next.

The dialogue is actually limited, but the film benefits from a lot of amazing action stunts and sequences, a bit of grisly gore, tight execution, a fast pace and another iconic performance by the young Mel Gibson as the all Australian, sawed off shotgun wielding hero. The filming of the large desert landscapes can also eye candy. This sequel is a another good insight on human greed, and it's a shame that the 2015 reboot was such a bad disappointment. Overall, this is an entertaining movie and especially a must-see for action fans. Good flick and recommended!!",

Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior picks up an unspecified time after the end of the first movie. Max has retreated into the wilderness, where he has become a loner. He returns to civilization when he needs gas and discovers a small settlement where there is refined fuel. At the time when Mad Max was made, Mel Gibson was a virtual unknown.

All the stunts in the move were real and that was really impressive due to the explosions and car stunts. The story was okay but it made sense so that was good, it was improved by the weird and well-acted characters. It was short too, it never got stale or boring while watching and that's a plus.

The poetic theme missing in the previous is installed subtly that helps delivering the plot and the protagonist just the right amount of gravitas that it needed.\n\nTicking for around 90 minutes, it is exhilarating and gripping, with a concrete material to offer to the viewers. The script isn't structured appropriately nor is it edited better, but it is undeniably a stand alone feature especially in its last act that is culminated into a long but entertaining chase sequence. \n\nGeorge Miller; the screenwriter and director, has up the ante of the game with not only his explicit writing but his brilliant execution skills that helps the feature connect with the viewers frame to frame. The performance has improved a lot since last time by the protagonist Mel Gibson especially but it still is a bumpy road on this lane since it doesn't get much range to factor in and leave the essential impression. The chemistry among the characters is built-up in a subtle yet effective way and the makers being aware since it is the only piece of plotline that can and does resonate with the audience instantly.\n\nMad Max 2 is cynically dangerous yet firmly kind on its advanced mythology that is worth exploring.",

That is to say that I thought it's not as good as the first but other than that, I actually DO think that the sequel really IS better than the first! It has big thrills and big chase sequences that is when you're watching up the very end! The end chase sequence is fantastic and it's fast, furious and bigger. Mel Gibson is back as Max Rockatansky and he's leaving town after he defeats Toecutter and the motorcycle gang and now he's driving in the middle of nowhere along with his dog. Seriously. How did he get the dog? Oh, well, I think he got it from the pet shop and then continued on riding. Max doesn't talk until 10 minutes later and then kept quiet until he went to the compound where there're people who wanted to get out but can't cause of Lord Humungus and Wez played by Vernon Wells. If they got out, they will be killed. So Max and the Gyro Captain had to help the people get out and take the fuel tank. So why does Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is better than Mad Max? Was it because of it's bigger thrills? Was it because of this sequel is one of the greatest films of all time? Was is because of the fact that it has everything that many people have got because it's bigger, faster, louder, but definitely not dumber? I would think so! I'll have to let you both handle this one. Whether than that many people prefer this one over the first is because of this movie gave the audience what they want. Bigger thrills and big chase sequences just like I said at first and that's just what they've got and in many respects, this is what I've got. This sequel is evocative in many levels and never suffers from many flaws. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is fantastic and it is one of the greatest sequels of all time!",

Max continues to scour the wastes until he comes across hopeless civilians needing help fight off raiders.

Gibson is better than ever (his character has now become iconic).",

Mad Max put the character on the map, but Road Warrior puts the franchise on the map.George Miller made his mark from the get-go by staging some gonzo bedlam, but - given a much bigger budget - he truly builds a world that effectively and giddily races away with filmgoers. His follow up, Fury Road, shares most of its DNA with this, the true franchise starting point.\n\nIn this R-rated sci-fi actioner set in in a post-apocalyptic Australian wasteland, a cynical drifter (Gibson) agrees to help a small, gasoline rich, community escape a band of bandits. \n\nMovies like this don't happen by accident. Miller loves grindhouse theatrics, but his mastery of the form evinces a genius level understanding of classic cinema. With Mad Max 2, he does something that fellow B-movie maestro Roger Corman never accomplished: branding a star vehicle. Sure footed, steely cool, and deservedly cocksure, Mel Gibson emerges as a bona fide superstar with this edgy defining role. \n\nBottom line: Apocalypto Now!",

We're treated to long, elaborate highway chases and a massive body count in a convincingly broken-down future. We also get the previously neglected origin story (albeit a vague one) along with all the mayhem and destruction Mad Max only flirted with. \n \nMy main issue with the first film was that things appeared far too new for a scenario which is supposed to show us the decline of civilization. You could still buy your baby ice cream and wear khaki slacks to the beach. Mad Max 2 gives us empty, red desert in all directions; an unending panorama of desolation. Here we find characters that actually appear to be fighting for survival and hanging onto their last shreds of human dignity. Some early-eighties fashions squeak their way into the costumes but I'm still basically convinced of their collective plight.\n \nGeorge Miller still uses some cheesy sped-up camera tricks during certain scenes but overall the camera work is much improved. The cinematography also gives us many impressive aerial shots and enhances the scope and presentation of the setting. The addition of the Gyro Captain character adds some excitement to the last third of the film as he is constantly swooping over enemies and attacking from above at unexpected moments.\n \nMad Max 2 succeeds with simplicity; it's a film equipped with self-awareness and never attempts to be anything but itself. It's light on dialogue and heavy on action, hitting all the right points to use each during the ninety-minute run time.\n \nThe only thing I missed from the original was the Toecutter, an entertaining and eccentric lead villain. All Miller gives us this time around is Jason Voorhees on steroids. He doesn't do much besides make threats from a distance and flex more than is necessary. \n \nWe get it dude, get back to camp already.",

On his journey, he stumbles upon a group of people that will need his help, while helping him in the process. You have all the makings of a fantastic action flick: Well choreographed and shot action, memorable characters, the silent hero, the comic relief...The list goes on. What the film does right is looked at as a cliche today, but The Road Warrior is basically the gold standard. Mel Gibson is back at Max, but this is a complete turn around from the vibrant Max we saw before. He only talks when he needs to and says only what is necessary. He doesn't get attached. This is a broken shell of the man we were introduced to, and Gibson plays it perfectly. The rest of the cast all hold their own, but most aren't around long enough to leave an impression. Action wise, there are some highly impressive scenes here that are memorable long after the film ends. Plot and pacing wise, the plot keeps it simple and the film moves at a breakneck speed to the explosive finale. In a world where sequels tend to be inferior to their predecessors, The Road Warrior shines as a huge leap forward for the series.",

            "content": "What a damn good sequel. Just like many action movie sequels, this one upped the stakes so much more than the first, and I think this darker side of Max intrigued me more, trying to be independent ever since the death of his family.\n\nThe movie opens with an educational film aesthetic, which briefly tells us more about this post-apocalyptic world than we learned from the first. A main problem is a shortage of gasoline, and this becomes an obsession of Max's from the start of the film as he tries to get to wherever he is going.\n\nOf course, this wouldn't be a Mad Max film if a rival biker gang didn't show up, so, of course, one does. Max finds himself in the middle of a small war between a community which has a good portion of gas to help themselves out, and a ruthless biker gang set out on resorting to violence if need be for the gas owned by the community which has set up their own base. Max just wants to drop off a near- dead member of the community for a supply of gas, but this community needs help, and Max struggles to decide whether to help them against these dangerous bikers or not.\n\nI love how Max is pretty silent in this film, not giving away a lot of what is on his mind, remaining kind of an emotional mystery in a sense. We assume he has trust issues after the recent death of his family, but we do not need to hear it from Max to understand its hold on him.\n\nI was not a fan of the visuals in the first film, but I think this one has a slightly better style. There are still fast cuts as in the first, especially in the action sequences, but I think we are able to see things happen more easily than we could in the first. One problem I had with the original was that we never lingered on many visuals, but this film seems to do this more, lingering on extremely wide shots of the landscape for us to take everything in, and the editing style even slows down during conversations to focus on the drama of the rivalry situation within the film.\n\nI enjoyed this film, especially since it had a much more epic scale than the first in my opinion. I am looking forward to Fury Road!",

Once again, the direction of George Miller is what makes this film great. He understands how to make a coherent action sequence and make it feel real. Miller crafts a desolate post-apocalyptic world that actually looks the part, immersing us in a gritty setting that intensifies the experience for the viewer. Most of the improvement in this film is in the production values and acting. The success of the first film gave The Road Warrior an exponentially larger budget, and it shows. The action is bigger, the sets are more complete, and the overall aesthetic is nicer. Mel Gibson has improved much from the first film, letting more emotion through his stoic character. I see The Road Warrior as one of the more overlooked '80s action films. It definitely rivals the best of them with its intensity and flawless direction.",

            "content": "When I started the Mad Max series this is more what I expected. It is a much more enjoyable story that I have heard accurately equated to a Western, like A Fistful of Dollars. Max comes upon a colony of people protecting one of the last oil refineries left in Australia. He works out a deal to help them transport the gas past a gang of thugs in exchange for some gas of his own. What Road Warrior got right from the very beginning that Mad Max lacked was a simple voiceover intro to explain how this world came to be. It's a logical story and does a great job of emphasizing why gas is such a desired commodity. I don't really know how it has become more important than things like food or water which seem just as scarce, but I'm willing to go along with the conceit of this film. Max truly becomes a hero (or at least anti-hero) in this chapter of the saga. I like how, despite the conditions of the world, he still seems to have a code of honor that he lives by. Mel Gibson really settles into the role here. He is tough as nails and hardened by the complex world. He really looks the part, and throughout the film he does a great job of conveying Max's emotional journey. Pairing him with a dog was a great idea too, because the mere presence of a pet creates an extra layer of empathy for the hero. It also added a couple of great comedic moments, which is necessary in an otherwise dark and gritty film.\n\nThe other thing that I think they did expertly in this film was creating some distinct characters within the refinery's community and the gang of thugs. It still bugs me that hardly anyone is ever addressed by name in these films, though. I hate that reasonably well-defined characters in the film are still referred to in the credits as \"Feral Kid\" or \"Warrior Woman.\" Even when someone is given a name it is only used like once, so it never sinks in. If I look in the credits at the name \"Wez\" I genuinely have no idea who that is within the context of the film. All that being said, it's one annoyance in a film that I otherwise quite enjoyed. There were lots of epic moments, and great action sequences. I think a few of them, like the final chase through the desert, were perhaps extended a bit too long but they kept the excitement dialed up so I didn't mind. One of the things that I greatly appreciate in The Road Warrior is the way they utilize wider shots so I can follow the action completely. The fights have a nice choreography to them, and I never lose track of where people are from one cut to the next. I also think the music does a lot of heavy lifting to keep the intensity heightened. Finally George Miller must be applauded for his use of practical effects and stunt-men. It's unreal some of the stuff that they pull off in this film, and that explosion (if you've seen the film, you know which one I'm talking about) is perhaps one of the most awe-inspiring in cinema history. The Road Warrior is a much better installment in the Mad Max franchise, and I'd recommend anyone who's interested just skip the first movie and jump right to this one. Mad Max 2 is leaps and bounds better than its predecessor, and requires no knowledge of that film to understand it.",

Overall, it was a good action movie and although it wasn't as great as I hoped it would be, it still managed to be entertaining and shocking. \n~May 14, 2015~",

            "content": "\"I remember a time of chaos, ruined dreams, this wasted land. But most of all, I remember The Road Warrior. The man we called Max.\"\n\nAfter having enjoyed Mad Max, I wasn't expecting to fall in love with its sequel, but The Road Warrior actually blew me away and I found it to be a much better film than its predecessor. I had thought that Mad Max had already established the post-apocalyptic world in the Australian wastelands, but in Mad Max 2 the world has become much more chaotic and there is no room for civilization whatsoever. It's still a low budget film, but director George Miller had more room to work with here and establish his vision of this crazy world. There is also more character development and despite not being entirely convinced by Mel Gibson's performance in the first film, I found him much more charismatic here and I can now understand why he became such a bankable actor during the following decades. There is actually a better story in The Road Warrior which plays out like a Western. Mel Gibson plays the loner Max who doesn't say much and seems to only care for himself. He arrives at an encampment where the few surviving members are trying their best to keep things civilized despite being surrounded by a group of violent bikers led by Lord Humungus (Kjell Nilsson) who are in need of their fuel refinery. Max makes a deal with the leader of the camp, Pappagallo (Michael Preston) to bring a truck back to the camp that will allow them to haul the tanker in exchange for all the gas he can take with him. Max is their only hope and he exits the compound while trying to escape Humungus and his men. That is how in a way the film follows the basic Western genre conventions with this mysterious man showing up as the only hope for the somewhat defenseless campers against a threatening enemy. However, Miller changes the horses for fast paced vehicles and guns for crossbows and sharp boomerangs. There aren't any cowboys or indians here, but rather all sort of wacky and crazy characters using whatever objects they've found in the wasteland as their wardrobe in this post-apocalyptic world.\n\nMel Gibson has very few lines in this film and he appears to be interested in himself, but his charm easily wins us over. He is in a way an anti-hero, but since he shares the same enemy in common with the campers he ends up finding people he can relate to. Max has suffered a lot and lost many loved ones so he prefers to be a loner and not make new friends. In this sequel he faces a much more menacing enemy with Humungus and his gang. One particular stand out in the villain role is Wez (Vernon Wells) who is probably the craziest character in the film. Max finds two misfit allies in the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), who at first tried to steal from him and then became Max's prisoner, and in a young brave boy known as the Feral Kid (Emil Minty) whose weapon of choice is a star boomerang. The performances in this film are all solid and the action scenes are incredibly exciting and intense. The final twenty minutes of the film had me at the edge of my seat and the car chases were extremely well shot. The score of the film does feel a bit heavy handed and manipulative, but considering this was filmed in 1981 I have to give it a lot of credit. I had an incredible time with this film and am even more excited for the upcoming Mad Max sequel. It will be hard to top this, but I won't complain if it's at least half as good as Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.\n\nThis is one of those rare sequels that builds and improves on their predecesor. The vision of this post-apocalyptic world is much better realized here and despite all the crazy characters the film still takes itself seriously. It is violent and there is actually a lot at stake, which is uncommon in action films these days. It is over the top in many ways, but it works extremely well in this world and I can't think of better chase sequences than there are here. The film has non-stop crazy action and it's a very entertaining experience. I absolutely recommend this!  \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

While Mad Max certainly had some great stunts, The Road Warrior takes it to 11. Essentially one giant chase sequence, The Road Warrior is porn for even the most amateur action junkie. The Road Warrior is one of the most influential films of the 1980s, and I can see why. While its barebones ( and I mean bare....bones) story detracted me a little, it couldn't stop me from being truly enthralled by just about every second of it.",

He runs into a gang run by a man named The Humungus (Kjell Nilsson) and his right hand crazy man Wez (Vernon Wells). The gang has been attacking a close by outpost that has a huge fuel deposit, but will not give into the Humungus' demands. Max along with a man only known as The Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence) help the people in exchange for fuel of their own. Soon Max realizes that these people need his help and has to decide whether to leave them, or ultimately save the outpost. There's of course more to it than that, but that's the basic jist of it all. There's some great car scenes, a ton of explosions, and Mel Gibson at his best. The post apocalyptic world just works so well for the Australian Outback and everything comes together nicely stringing together the myth of Mad Max by the end of the film. Minor complaint would probably be Max is still in it for himself by the end of the film. He's not a changed man, but this is kind of just showing his development from the first film from a family man that lost everything to a man now that is reluctant to befriend or help because he doesn't want to have attachments. His character is basically the same throughout the film, but it all changes a bit in the inevitable sequel. Overall, great film and highly recommended if you've never seen it before!",

Human settlements are mostly non-existent, as survivors have taken to the roads either as pacifist survivors or as members of the many violent road gangs. Max Rockatansky, after the devastating series of events in Mad Max, now scavenges and attempts to survive in the barren desert in his iconic V8 Interceptor, with a dog as his lone companion.\n\nTaking everything that made the first movie a success, Miller crafts the Mad Max dystopian world to perfection with the even more violent and bleak The Road Warrior. As the first movie ultimately turned into a revenge Western set against a dystopic, increasingly apocalyptic backdrop, The Road Warrior revels in its placement within an actual apocalyptic setting. In order to achieve the effect of being in the middle of a pre-apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic setting, Miller - with screenwriters Terry Hayes and Brian Hannant - intentionally craft a movie which is effectively worse in everything that it tackles compared to Mad Max.\n\nWhere Mad Max was the mute witness to the slow decay of society and the increasing reduction of fuel - a core part the series -, and the reliance of the characters on it, The Road Warrior is the very by-product of a non-existent societal structure without law, which is made worse as the survivors fight for what little fuel they come across. With that comes the turn of man into a more animalistic nature as they shed their humanity to step on others in the name of survival. It is this method of crafting both a dystopian and apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic tale by the Mad Max franchise which would go on to inspire many other similar stories, particularly that of the zombie post-apocalyptic subgenre.\n\nIt isn't just the thematic, world building, tone, aesthetic, atmosphere and the numerous action scenes involving vehicles in The Road Warrior that shine; the characters too are well acted and crafted, with their many subtle-to-not-so-subtle nuances shedding a light on their characteristics. From the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence) who uses snakes to kill others as a way of stealing fuel but shows his humanity after witnessing a rape and murder, to Max's interaction with the \"Feral Kid\" being one that harkens back to his late son, and with the comically acted gang members - with their silly leather and hockey wear - displaying a ruthless range of personalities from sadism to misanthropy, the characters in The Road Warrior are - suffice to say - colorfully written in a depressing and bleak way.",

            "content": "This is an outstanding sequel that really shows what Miller probably would have liked to have done previously if he had the budget. This film really develops its world not only visually, with an excellent soundtrack that complement each other but with what it has become, a lot has happened since the last time we saw Max and it's really believable; the film is packed with beautiful and epic shots that are just amazing to look at. Max also feels like he is given more to do in this film despite only having about 16 lines of dialogue, which was a shock to read after the film, as the script is great as well. The story has a 'For a Few Dollars More' feel to it and even Max himself feels like a character from that film, they even call him, 'Man with No Name', in the next film. Nevertheless, it's totally solid, it is built up in a very believable way and it's totally thrilling to watch, I thought the gasoline people were going to be the villains at first but it all works out. I also like how some of what happens isn't explained but is just told through imagery, which happens all throughout this trilogy but the ending of this film had it in particular. Max now has a dog and also has some more characters to interact with this time, with one following him around but saying that, I liked Bruce Spence's character, we don't know what to make of him at first and I thought it was a little odd for Max to free his hands after a while because who knows what he could have done but he's harmless, funny and a good addition, even though his character did just disappear for a while. The ending of this film is spectacular to watch and the long highway is an excellent place to film and everything that happens just keeps escalating and it keeps doing new things and of course, the fact that it is all actually happening makes it all the more greater and immersive but the leader of the town really should have kept his eyes on the road.\n\nMy only real complaint with the film is with what some of the clothes that the gang wear, yeah this is a post-apocalypse so they're not exactly going to be wearing battle armour but I found it a bit odd how they all left so much skin exposed, despite all the obvious fights they were going to get into. What Max wears is pretty much the same as the last film but it has little changes that are very well connected with the last film. One of the major members of the gang had assless chaps and that was odd to see but it wasn't as bad as his friend literally having his whole chest on display; but even that wasn't as bad as the leader who literally had about 97% of his body exposed and it was goofy to see, I know that is mostly the point with the villains wearing black and the heroes wearing but still. But hey, a member of this group couldn't see that one of the children that was pretty much right under his nose was making noises to distract him and the leader had the fuel to his car exposed, so you just have to go with the ride. The film also had a very odd introduction that would seem to be something that would be used in the first film but given how the film ends and the fact that the first film had limited release around the world, it has a double purpose. Also, at some points, footage would just randomly speed up. \n\nI want more of these films, this world and this character just feel like they have so many stories to tell and this is just one of the many escapades that we get to see. 'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior' is an excellent sequel with strong acting and total commitment by everyone involved and really stands out well.",

It fixes itself in all the necessary areas. We're given the background that was missing from the first film, the struggle for oil is more obvious, and the premise is more clear. \n\nIn Mad Max 2, Max (Mel Gibson) wanders along the empty highway when he hears of a small community that is an oasis of oil. He infiltrates their gates and helps them ward off the heathenish biker gang that is attempting to take everything they own.\n\nMany times in a sequel the characters have hit a wall as far as development. They learn all they have to learn in the first film, and the second film just shows them facing a new adventure with nothing new to be taken from it. But here, Max continues to develop as he realizes that he's not the only one with a loss and that there may actually be a purpose for him other than serving himself. Even though he still leaves his friends despite this realization, this forced predicament is needed in order for him to learn a valuable life lesson.\n\nWhile the first film feels really anticlimactic, this one knows where it's going and we are more invested because of it. In the broad spectrum of things these movies don't have much reliability to our own lives, but watching a respectable hero can be motivating alone.\n\nThe action is even better-choreographed and the effects are more impressive, but there is still that same issue that the first film had of trying to stretch its script too thin. The dragged out fight scenes, where the characters cumulatively fire an average of one shot per minute, not only lower each party's chance of winning, but increase our anxiety.\n\nAlthough I wished that the filmmakers had connected the events in this film to the first, I have to say that it's significantly more entertaining and much less disorganized. \n\nTwizard Rating: 83",

The second movie is all about this Australian ex-policeman, his dog, and his Ford, and how he finds his humanity again in a dystopian future. Along the way are amazing action set pieces and 1980s-style gratuitous violence and nudity.\n\nThe way women are treated in these films is problematic; they exist only to be raped and/or slaughtered. Balancing that is how some of the men exist only to be raped and slaughtered. Another problem is the depiction of homosexuality; it exists in these movies as just another example of how men turn evil. Really the subtext is just awful.\n\nThen again, this IS dystopian and it WAS the late 1970s/ early 1980s. Despite these issues (and without even getting into lead actor Mel Gibson and his more recent rants), this is still one of the best sequels ever made, an exciting, witty, darkly humorous, kick-ass masterclass in filmmaking. The cinematography is gorgeous, the editing is fantastic, and the plot is full of world-building that makes an evil kind of sense, even as it races forward toward the exhilarating signature death-convoy finale.\n\nIt took me this long to finally watch the Mad Max series, but now that I have, the second one especially remains an instant classic.",

But it is big on action, it is extremely fast faced and it is incredibly stylish to boot. The sequel takes a few years after the first movie. Max Rockatansky (Two-Time Oscar Winner:Mel Gibson) has become an man, who drives aimlessly in the search for food and especially gas in the dangerous Australian outback. Life for Max has never been the same, after he lost his wife and his son to vicious violent bikers. Now criminals rules the roads and there is no law in sight anymore. Now Max finds himself with an group of desperate people, who has produced something valuable...gasoline. Which these people needs Max help to escape from a roving band of marauders.\n\nDirected by George Miller (Mad Max, Happy Feat, Lorenzo's Oil) made an Superior sequel to \"Mad Max\". Which it was titled in the U.S. as \"The Road Warrior\". This movie certainly made Mel Gibson, an international superstar at that time. It was an surprise box office hit in the U.S. in 1982 and it was extremely well received by the film critics (especially the moviegoers). The action sequences are one of a kind (Brilliantly staged by the director) and terrific cinematography by Oscar-Winner:Dean Semler (Dances with Wolves, Dead Calm, Razorback). Besides Gibson's presence as the lead, there is three enjoyable supporting performances here. Vernon Wells, who went on to play the role of Bennett in the enjoyable, tongue in cheek, Over the Top action flick \"Commando\". Bruce Spence as the Gyro Captain is a hoot in his role and Emil Minty as the wild, long haired kid, who can defend himself is also great in it. Director Miller keeps everything moving in this movie. The last action sequence is still one of the best ever filmed for this type of feature. Certainly Miller's best work and one of Gibson's best roles. Grade:A.",

I loved the warm colors of the desolate outback, the costumes and of course the vehicles. There are more of them, more variety and they're bigger, customized and prepared for combat.

The character of Max, in this film, is represented as a mercenary, which protects this community of refugees, only for fuel, but it does not mean that the character has lost his humanity, which is represented in a beautiful scene, in where Max shows and plays a mechanism for a carillon to a child and giving it to him, smiling.

The first Mad Max was one of those films where the action was the best aspect of the film but the rest of the film pulled it back from being great. With Mad Max 2 that is not the case, this film is fantastic. Everything about this film is much better than the first. Mel Gibson is much better in this film and gives a great performance. His performance is a very physical one as Max famously has around 16 or so lines so Gibson has to give a much more physical performance and he's great. Bruce Spence plays the Gyro Captain and he's great in his role. All of the acting is great and there's also a really good child actor who plays thee Feral Kid and he's really good and is surprisingly good for a kid. While in the first Mad Max you had Toe Cutter and his gang who were very silly to say the least but here you have The Lord Humungus and Wez who are both great villains. The Lord Humungus and Wez are such cool villains and while they might not be the greatest ever they're still really cool villains and in my opinion still the best Mad Max villains. George Miller did a really fantastic job directing this film, especially in the fantastic action scenes which are very tense and visually brilliant. The action here is fantastic especially the end chase which is great. I really enjoy this film but there are problems without a doubt. One is that the script is good but some of the lines aren't really very good but to be honest that is Mad Max for you. Also the ending is very abrupt especially with the villains pay off. There isn't a lot to say about Mad Max 2 it's just a great piece of action escapism which is very fun with great characters and great spectacle. It's the second best of the franchise and one of the best action films of the 1980's. I love this film and to be honest you can skip the first Mad Max but you have to watch The Road Warrior. A",

The story structure is very interesting in that the pov is from a little boy telling a tale, therefore it adds a unique twist where the events may have been completely exaggerated from reality. I don't personally believe this, but it gave me something to think about! The final twenty minutes is where it's at and the frenetic action is exhilarating and the now-famous car stunts are spectacular.

            "content": "MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR is about on-par with the first, slightly edging it out due to increased focus on character (even if the plot is about as thin) and bigger, more spectacular stunts. This time, the world (or at least Australia) is in the full-on post-apocalypse and looks like a desolate wasteland, for the most part. Biker gangs still roam the countryside, only now they're more vicious and more outlandish as far as their fashion choices go. It looks they got their clothes from an S&M shop sometimes. They also rape and pillage as they hunt for that precious commodity, gasoline. Max has also changed since we last saw him. He's more grizzled and looks almost war-weary, and instead of policing he's been reduced to scavenging like everyone else. The only difference between him and the others is his code. On his travels he meets a group of survivors guarding a treasure trove of gasoline, only they don't have the means to transport it. So they enlist his help, all while being threatened (and eventually attacked) by a vicious gang led by a freak named Humongous. Story-wise, the movie was about as thin as the last one. However, this time there are more characters and a smattering of humor as well. The characters that stood out the most to me were the Gyro Captain and one of the gang members with a red mohawk. There was also a feral child who provides some of the film's more endearing moments, and forms somewhat of a bond with Max. Generally speaking, I thought that the ensemble nature of this film is what makes it work. Sure, the stunts and special effects are excellent (and improved), but it was nice that the film didn't just rely on those elements to tell the story. Still, I do have a couple minor complaints. First, it looked like some of the action sequences were sped up. This might be too much of a nitpick, but it gave off a silent film vibe that didn't exactly mesh with the overall tone of the film as a whole. Second, it took until about the halfway point for the narrative to really take shape and gain some focus. Not that there wasn't anything to like beforehand, but (and this is where my expectations were a little undercut) I was led to believe that the film would be a little more singular and direct than it actually turned out to be. Still, I thought that the film and world it established were very well-realized. Also worthy of mention is the rousing score by Brian May (not of Queen). Overall, this post-apocalyptic action film isn't quite what I expected (but closer than what the last one turned out to be), but it's a fun ride that doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator of the audience. Highly recommended.",

This is especially true for not only our protagonist-by-trade Max (Mel Gibson), but also our antagonist-by-default Humungus (Kjell Nilsson). Other than the precious commodity of gasoline, what else is there to compromise about? You want exposition? You'll have to go somewhere else. You want romance? Find that in our comic relief Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), whose clumsy, but decent aerial combat skills and compassion for the safety of his team are much more attractive than the broody, selfish behaviour of the more physically apt Max. Take the car combat sequences as you wish. They never reach phenomenal cinematic heights, probably since the characters do not seem to communicate much other than we are supposed to fight, but the sequences are undoubtedly well choreographed. Very dirty and non-gimmicky, too. If you treat this like eye candy, you may not get too much flavour out of it. I suggest that you savour this one. Find a more intimate audience who would still appreciate car combat.",

The shots, angles and photography is something you don't usually give a shit in an action movie, but Mad Max 2 shines with those: the landscapes are filmed and photographed in such a way, it makes the world feel bigger and upgrades the scale of the movie, filmed almost as it was an epic. All this makes Mad Max 2 definitely worth watching at any moment.\n\nA great example of sequel, The Road Warrior is superior to the original Mad Max, an example all sequels should follow (and had, like The Dark Knight or Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan). Is the best movie ever? No. Is it the best sequel ever? No, but is one of the best and very close. Does it worth before dying? Yes. Should I stop making questions?

You better get educated now before the upcoming video game and new movie, \"Mad Max: Fury Road,\" hits theaters and you're left in the dust wondering what all the fuss is about.\n\nMax is an ex-police officer that gets caught up in other people's problems in a post-apocalyptic world where gas and other everyday commodities have become extremely scarce. In order to get these people out of trouble, he somehow always ends up in a fast-paced battle between futuristic weaponized cars built out of junkyard scraps. Just watching these vehicular skirmishes will provide therapy for anyone's road rage.\n\n\"The Road Warrior\" contains some unnecessary scenes of brief nudity. Who can forget those buttless chaps the one guy in wears? Obviously, there's graphic sequences of violence and some bad language as well.\n\nhttp://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

The story is simple, albeit complex at times. It follows Max into an oil camp, guarded by the most interesting people I've seen in film in a while. He first wants to steal the oil, because at this point in the age of man, it is worth much more than gold; However, once he realizes that he is not the only one after their oil, he teams up and then the action begins. This film is one energetic piece of film that I'll never get tired of. At times it may drag a bit, but it is such an awesome film that I just can't complain!",

The action was decent, and the world finally looked like a dystopia instead of just looking like Australia.  And Max finally started to act like a badass and not just a regular dude that was a little upset with the world.  There were some sound issues with the movie, but the movie itself was sound.  I would not necessarily recommend this movie for a watch just because you might want to watch the first movie first, and I still don't recommend that.\nFull Review at: http://robertreviewsstuff.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/mad-max-2-the-road-warrior-1981/",

Unbelievable editing, camera positioning, and stunt work. George Miller, take a bow. You have left me awestruck with your accomplishment of directing this beast. Roger Ebert summed it up best when he said, ''\"Mad Max 2\" [released in the United States as \"The Road Warrior\"] is a film of pure action, of kinetic energy organized around the barest possible bones of a plot. It has a vision of a violent future world, but it doesn't develop that vision with characters and dialogue. It would rather plunge headlong into one of the most relentlessly aggressive movies ever made. I walked out of \"Mad Max 2\" a little dizzy and with my ears still ringing from the roar of the soundtrack; I can't say I \"enjoyed\" the film, but I'll hardly forget it.'' \n\nI highly recommend it for a one time viewing at least.",

Its sequel, The Road Warrior, is no different. I've heard so much praise for this movie, even more than its predecessor, and when I'm asked what I think of it, I simply just shrug and say \"I don't like it\". And then it's pointless for me to try and explain myself because people will just ignore it.\r\n\r\nBut, I don't enjoy this movie. It just doesn't work with me. The limited amount of dialog kills me, and I get bored very quick. The action scenes, while plentiful, were never capable gathering my interest and instead just stumble along until the movie is over. None of the story is very interesting or unique either. I've seen the basic \"lonely wanderer stumbles upon a town threatened by a gang and eventually saves it\" story countless times before, and I've seen it done better countless times before. Also, the villains are very weak and their costumes are ridiculous. All this causes the movie to look like I could have made it in my high school video class with my lunch money for the week.\r\n\r\nThere are some things I do enjoy, believe it or not, and there's more things I enjoy in this one than the first. Mel Gibson is significantly cooler in his role and much improved in terms of acting (there is little dialog for him, however, so any weak acting he may show is limited). I also like the brief running time, which, like the first , makes it easier to sit through and quicker to finish.\r\n\r\nSo, The Road Warrior is just another one of the movies that I seem to be the odd one out with. The poor picture quality (even watching it in HD on TV a little while back, it still looked bad) sums up the entire film for me. It's a dull, lifeless 90 minute movie that bores more than entertains and is as sharp as a crayon after scribbling with it for 10 minutes.",

All that being said, The Road Warrior has a paper thin plot without any sort of character development for star Mel Gibson or the other characters.  That would be my biggest problem with the film.

Fortunately, we're still left with a very entertaining apocalyptic action film, so far removed from pretension and immersed in the serious kind of silliness. Road Warrior is like a live action comic book on steroids, with Mel Gibson alternately scowling and grumbling his lines as the antihero Max. The chase finale still stands as one of the best committed to film, and the villains are hysterically over-the-top in their maliciousness. It's a shame that movies like The Road Warrior are rarely made these days, because it really is a lot of fun. Oh, the characters-besides Max-aren't really fleshed out, but the entertainment value is incredibly high, and the movie is never as big and dumb as other action bonanzas.

            "content": "Due to its Australian production, most US moviegoers did not see dystopian action flick Mad Max until years later (other than a small limited release in 1980), long after the sequel, The Road Warrior (AKA Mad Max 2 in non-US territories) was shown in American cinemas. As my review may recall, I enjoyed the first Mad Max a great deal, but I felt that it was an imperfect 70s action movie, that didn't really capture the feel of a post-apocalyptic Earth. Rather, it showed a world in decline, one headed for apocalypse but not quite there yet. And maybe that's the difference between Mad Max and The Road Warrior, as I believe that not only is The Road Warrior a markedly superior film to the original, it's easily one of the best action films ever. It corrects virtually every problem I had with the first film; \"Mad Max\" is actually mad the entire time, the post-apocalyptic wasteland is actually grungy, desperate, and almost medieval in its execution, there is a fully compelling cast of characters, both heroes and villains, and the action sequences are far more intense and high-stakes. Also, I think it actually makes the first Mad Max even better, as it allows that film to merely serve as the backstory for this one, where all hell breaks loose. George Miller makes his sophomore effort having learned the mistakes he made the first time around, directing the action sequences with more vigor and confidence. Screenwriter Terry Hayes comes on to help Miller write this time around, and his assistance seems to have helped tremendously, as the story this time is far more coherent and direct, with a clear-cut goal from beginning to end. And of course, it doesn't hurt that Miller once again has the superb talents of a young, top-of-his-game Mel Gibson, who truly brings the \"mad\" to Max Rockatansky this time. It's a haunting and badass performance, that no doubt shaped Gibson's career in the years to come. I also enjoyed Bruce Spence's performance as the Gyro captain, who initially comes across as sneaky and wimpy, but ultimately proves himself to be a smart and courageous asset. Michael Preston's idealistic Papagallo serves as a moral and reasoning counterpoint to Max's single-minded determination, and Kjell Nilsson conveys much ferocity behind his mask as the gang leader Humungus. Vernon Wells' Wez serves as Max's mirror, as Humungus serves to Papagallo. Brian May delivers a greatly improved score this time around, and Dean Semler's cinematography, his sweeping landscapes and wide shots of post-apocalyptic terror, is what truly paints the picture of Max Rockatansky's demented world. The Road Warrior is a must-see for all action fans.",

It is very brutal and gritty and still retains comedy in its dark violence; I was very happy to see Vernon Wells after loving his role in Commando. I felt this film was constantly changing its pace and this really sent your opinion haywire. You could not settle down because one minute there was a high octane car chase and the next is a slow and boring environment where nothing really happens.

Even though the actual storyline itself is very minimum, this film is a good example of the concept \u00e2simple story, good film\u00e2?.\n\nMel Gibson, with just 16 lines, 2 of which are the same, is perfect in his role, there is a reason it is one of his most iconic roles, and it is all through his body language, his stance, his eyes. Max is all about his car, his dog, and his gas, his dark persona impressioned upon him since the first film. It is also great seeing him with a ready made knee brace, reflecting the harshness of the world around him.\n\nThe cast behind Gibson are much stronger then I remembered, characters such as The Gyro Captain, Pappagallo & The Warrior Woman were good back-up, all had their own little moments and with several of the heroes being killed off, you did feel the effect of it slightly in comparison to some films. However, the best two supporting cast were the villain Humungus and his henchman Wez. Humungus was freakishly massive with a charismatic and articulate style, which made him a surprising but interesting villain, and his henchman Wez was one of the best I have ever seen, his maniacal edge mixing well against his hated opponent in Max.\n\nGreat film, wonderfully enjoyable, have to see it more often.",

Keeping with its action-exploitation style, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior pushes new limits on the genre by making use of its newfound budget and expanding upon the Max Rockatansky mythology. With Mad Max having spent the entire film establishing the nature of the titular character, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior takes that characterization and runs with it as a means of building a more action heavy premise which reflects a more traditional Western series of plot points. The film is a western, and it explores that kind of mythology through a post-apocalytpic action premise which delivers to the point of being a superior sequel. It does this through storytelling which demands minimal dialogue and delivers in terms of mostly being a visual experience, reliant on practical effects and stunts above all else.\nWhile Mad Max was a film which really had to stretch its low budget a long way, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is a film which has more money and more to do with it. The first thing that Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior puts on display for viewers is the quality of its car crash stunts. In what was the high point of Mad Max, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior instantly shows a serious increase in quality with a world of superior design and detail to surround it. The stunts in Mad Max 2 end up being choreographed incredibly well and are exhilarating, making a more creative use of the sadistic characters and the universe around them. The production design itself is very detailed with the film making a significantly greater use of the Australian outback landscape for its story than its predecessor. The props also scream dystopia, and the costumes of the film feel like an odd blend between western, war and dystopian science fiction which gives the characters an interesting look. Everything in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior has an interesting look about it, and it makes the film a very convincing visual experience which captures the stylish appeal of a great post-apocalpytic film. The universe itself is intriguing in terms of story, and the way that George Miller has it all laid out with every little visual element gives it the convincing edge that it really needs. But what makes it work is that the film is so consistent in using them. Rather than spending time blankly looking at the universe of the story, the world in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior always looks appealing though it plays into the background a lot of the time while the narrative just keeps on moving forward. For a western film, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior defies the archetype of being slow moving and rather keeps its story rolling while the scenery of the film as well as the action keep it consistently interesting. This is a new kind of storytelling that George Miller brings to the table, and it give Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior an excellent standard of filmmaking for Australia, action films and just in general. \nAnd the visual appeal of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is captured with brilliant cinematography. The many wide shots follow the western archetype well and they consistently give viewers a full sense of what is going on during the action scenes by cutting between claustrophobic close shots and large-scale long shots. This repeats the stylish feat of Mad Max but captures significantly more and raises the bar for the genre. And blended with some timely editing, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior proves to be consistent with its style and narrative, effectively continuing the series with a massive rise in quality.\nBut perhaps the ultimate improvement in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is the increase in action. The quality of the action is better this time around, but the quantity is even better because the universe of the film is such a grim and violent one where the only solution to any problem is found through violence and George Miller lives up to that with an extensive amount of exhilarating action. The few moments where the action stops are full of subtle storytelling and gritty intensity while the action heavy moments are choreographed exceptionally well and made to last a long time without ever getting old. Incidentally, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is simply one of the finest Australian films ever made because of George Miller's technical competence as director and his ability to expand upon his own universe so well.\nAnd the cast of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior are given greater characters to work with which allow them to make more of an impression than the cast of the first Mad Max.\nMel Gibson is given more material to work with in the role of the titular Road Warrior Max Rockatansky in the sense that he is turned into an essentially mythological spaghetti western hero with an iconic gritty appearance. Mel Gibson integrates a fearless and aimless hard edge into the role with an intimidating desensitisation to the violence around him. He carries the perfect level of grit throughout the entire film and grasps his weaponry like a truly fearless action hero, making him the exact hero the film needs. Mel Gibson engages with the universe of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior on an all new level which pays a lot of credibility to him and his character, enhancing the film and challenging him to a fight which he wins.\nBruce Spence provides some moments of humour here and there while also going back on some really dramatic moments towards the end of the film. Emil Minty also captures the savage nature of the Feral Kid in a role which he seems to be having fun with, while Virginia Hey provides an awesome heroine for the story who really stands tall with the brooding stature and confidence of the Amazonian woman she embodies. \nLastly, Kjell Nilsoon makes an intimidating antagonist based on his use of voice and his use of his muscular form even though he hids behind a mask the entire film. The facial expressions are left to his right hand man played by Vernon Wells who really captures the savagely antagonistic nature of Wez in his face, his aggressive body language and his tone of voice. Both these cast members, particularly Vernon Wells, provide a gritty edge to the film with relentlessly gritty performances.\n\nSo Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior improves on its predecessor by bringing along the same titular character from Mad Max and expanding upon him with more action of a better quality, a more vast and edgy universe and a consistent sense of intensity thanks to George Miller's brilliant direction..",

            "content": "\"I remember a time of chaos, ruined dreams, this wasted land. But most of all, I remember The Road Warrior. The man we called Max.\"\n\nAfter having enjoyed Mad Max, I wasn't expecting to fall in love with its sequel, but The Road Warrior actually blew me away and I found it to be a much better film than its predecessor. I had thought that Mad Max had already established the post-apocalyptic world in the Australian wastelands, but in Mad Max 2 the world has become much more chaotic and there is no room for civilization whatsoever. It's still a low budget film, but director George Miller had more room to work with here and establish his vision of this crazy world. There is also more character development and despite not being entirely convinced by Mel Gibson's performance in the first film, I found him much more charismatic here and I can now understand why he became such a bankable actor during the following decades. There is actually a better story in The Road Warrior which plays out like a Western. Mel Gibson plays the loner Max who doesn't say much and seems to only care for himself. He arrives at an encampment where the few surviving members are trying their best to keep things civilized despite being surrounded by a group of violent bikers led by Lord Humungus (Kjell Nilsson) who are in need of their fuel refinery. Max makes a deal with the leader of the camp, Pappagallo (Michael Preston) to bring a truck back to the camp that will allow them to haul the tanker in exchange for all the gas he can take with him. Max is their only hope and he exits the compound while trying to escape Humungus and his men. That is how in a way the film follows the basic Western genre conventions with this mysterious man showing up as the only hope for the somewhat defenseless campers against a threatening enemy. However, Miller changes the horses for fast paced vehicles and guns for crossbows and sharp boomerangs. There aren't any cowboys or indians here, but rather all sort of wacky and crazy characters using whatever objects they've found in the wasteland as their wardrobe in this post-apocalyptic world.\n\nMel Gibson has very few lines in this film and he appears to be interested in himself, but his charm easily wins us over. He is in a way an anti-hero, but since he shares the same enemy in common with the campers he ends up finding people he can relate to. Max has suffered a lot and lost many loved ones so he prefers to be a loner and not make new friends. In this sequel he faces a much more menacing enemy with Humungus and his gang. One particular stand out in the villain role is Wez (Vernon Wells) who is probably the craziest character in the film. Max finds two misfit allies in the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), who at first tried to steal from him and then became Max's prisoner, and in a young brave boy known as the Feral Kid (Emil Minty) whose weapon of choice is a star boomerang. The performances in this film are all solid and the action scenes are incredibly exciting and intense. The final twenty minutes of the film had me at the edge of my seat and the car chases were extremely well shot. The score of the film does feel a bit heavy handed and manipulative, but considering this was filmed in 1981 I have to give it a lot of credit. I had an incredible time with this film and am even more excited for the upcoming Mad Max sequel. It will be hard to top this, but I won't complain if it's at least half as good as Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.\n\nThis is one of those rare sequels that builds and improves on their predecesor. The vision of this post-apocalyptic world is much better realized here and despite all the crazy characters the film still takes itself seriously. It is violent and there is actually a lot at stake, which is uncommon in action films these days. It is over the top in many ways, but it works extremely well in this world and I can't think of better chase sequences than there are here. The film has non-stop crazy action and it's a very entertaining experience. I absolutely recommend this!  \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

Even though it was made a generation ago, it's set in a near apocalyptic future where oil has run out and civilization has crumbled, so it might well be a movie released today. When it was released in the 80's it was a very exciting film to watch, with all its car stunts and non stop action. The Australian film was also one of the first films that Mel Gibson did (the latest being reviewed Mad Max), and with the iconic character of Max the little mad one, both actor and creation became starts and an ingrained part of our culture. Mad Max 2 was actually the sequel to the previous Mad Max, another Australian production, both directed by George Miller, and its success pushed the wave of the Australian invasion. Subsequently, the first Mad Max was re-released in the US, and a third sequel was later made and released. Since most people in the US hadn't seen the first Mad Max before, most people experienced this second movie first, as a standalone piece.\n\nThe movie starts with the original Mad Max 2 title card which is great, as it lets you know immediately it's the version as it originally was, intact. After a brief \"into\", we're literally thrown into the widescreen action and it barely stops from them on. We instantly are aware the future is dangerous, we need gas, and the savage remnants of humanity aren't playing nice. And it's gonna take the hardiest, cleverest, maybe maddest of persons to survive. And Max is all of them. All he wants it gas to keep moving on and surviving. But sometimes you need to make pacts with others to get what you want. So Max has to weight joining forces with a group of survivors for the time being. And here lies the excuse for a story full of car chases, car crashes, stunt doubles flying through the air and audiences saying did I really see that happen? Not a CGI effect in sight on those days, even the night scenes were shot at night. The movie has some blood and stunts that look so realistic, you wondered how many people were getting hurt, plus some nudity in a few brief shots.\n\nWith creepy characters galore, and the slightly different accents and cultural perspective of an Australian production, Max was different and a lot whole of fun, it was a very fresh movie back then, and although now in the jaded CGI-ed 21st century we're used to more visually complex extravaganzas, the passage of time makes watching Max a strange retro/futuro experience. I saw the film a while back, and this time it was almost like watching a middle-ages movie set in the future, no crazy gadgets, no zap guns, just human real action and violence, with a Mad Max in the middle of it tying it up. The car sequences are still impressive and \"villains\" are still outrageous. After you watch the movie, knowing there's a \"prequel\", you want to watch some more cool car action, and you feel ready to pop in another Mad Max movie. In other words, fully satisfying and leaves you wanting for more. In a literal sense, they almost never do them like these no more.",

Some may suggest since it is dated that I can't enjoy it like I would a movie that would be made today. My answer...maybe. The Road Warrior \"duct-taped\" the biggest problem from the first movie which was the choppy, half-a** editing and lack of consistency and flow telling the story throughout the movie. Its \"duct-taped\" because this movie still has the same issues...just less. \"Mad\" Max is not really mad he's just a guy reacting to stuff in the desert. The refugees under attack are like lemmings to the weirdos trying to get their gas. Sure its a great action movie...with great action sequences, eccentric characters, and awesome sets, but in the end it was the lack of good storytelling that made it just another middle of the road movie for me.",

            "content": "This is what I'm talking about!  The first Mad Max had a cool concept and some great action scenes, but on a whole its thin plot and uninteresting characters made it a failed experemint.  The Road Warrior however is just plain awesome.  Within about the first 5 minutes it takes care of every problem I had with the first one:  A narrorated backstory is given, the plot starts right away, and the world actually feels apocalyptic.  Right away it's better.\r\n\r\nThe film focuses on a group of people who are drilling and refining oil, because at this point whoever has the oil rules the world, but a group of biker rebels, not unlike the ones in the first film, are trying to kill them to steal it.  They need a way to get the oil out and to a safe location, but only Mad Max can take it there.\r\n\r\nRight away the plot is better also.  It starts right, and it's original.  It's not the ripoff western revenge story of the first, but something new, and something that actually means something.  The whole idea of oil ruling the world could actually reflect modern society, but I don't think they were really going for that.  Call it an accidental social commentary.\r\n\r\nMax is also a much more interesting character.  He's already lost his family and gone \"Mad\", but this time he's given a little more emotion, and his attachment to the oil people's kid is a perfect example of that.  I also love how mysterious they make him.  It's like one day he just kind of walked into their lives and the next minute he was gone.  The final shot of him on the road is one of the most spooky and awesome in film history.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the characters aren't quite as good.  The oil people don't have a whole lot to say and don't really do anything.  Max's partner who owns the helicopter is pretty funny but the real highlights other than Max himself are the bikers.  The old bikers were kind of over the top and stupid and sort of reminded me of a gang from The Warriors if anybody's seen that movie, whereas here they are indeed over the top, but they're frightening and they actually seem like more of a threat.\r\n\r\nThe effects are actually toned down a bit in this one.  The car chases aren't over the top crazy like in the first one, but they're still enjoyable and the final chase on the Mack truck is just plain awesome.  There is a final explosion that's pretty spectacular aswell but again, it's the only one and it's at the end.\r\n\r\nAll the chases are also halped by some superior camerawork.  It goes inside, outside, in the hood, on the roof, it's everywhere and it's captures it all perfectly, as it does for everything else in the movie.  On a whole this movie is a lot better from this standpoint.  Director George Miller is no longer an amateur and he really did a great job with it, an it's undoubtedly his masterpiece.\r\n\r\nUnfortunely his script is a little weak again.  All in all there just isn't a whole lot of talking in it.  It's true that a movie can be good with little talking, look at anythig Sergio Leone did, but the difference is that in those movies when people did say stuff it was something interesting and important.  Here it's just sort of dull.  It's probably the only weak point of a great movie that is really unfortunate.\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed was that the musical score actually wasn't as good.  It was written by Brian May, possibly the guitar player from Queen but I'm not sure, and on a whole it just isn't as intense as the music from the first film, but I would never say that it's bad.\r\n\r\nOn a whole The Road Warrior is just about a perfect sequel.  It took ever problem with the first film and fixed it while also creating a great film itself.  It ditched the whole action packed B-movie style of the first film and gave it a much darker approach and the end result is a cult classic that is essential viewing for fans of the genre.",

This story picks up soon after the original Mad Max and from there it throws us into overdrive. What once crept up into intensity now features adrenaline pulsing action almost nonstop. Yet this is not the mindless action we might be expecting. It is barbaric but the fight is all over the most valuable commodity the dying earth has: fuel. Max is quiet and keen on getting what he needs then moving on back onto the endless highway. When he is basically forced to help some settlers transport their tanker of fuel out of the wasteland, the plot thickens. Yet as is thickens, it is still very simple: outrun or outfight the gang of killers that threaten them. What ensues is action bliss. It doesn't get any faster or harder than these blasts and crashes. Mel Gibson settles any debate on his presence and proves that he will be around for a long time entertaining us. I admire the simplicity and the survival factor in this sequel and while I am not convinced it is better than the original, it is definitely a worthy sequel that will always be mentioned either before or after the original. How rare is this? Star Wars, Alien, and The Terminator did it but not before The Road Warrior cleared the way. (B)",

            "content": "This movie is pretty fantastic.  It's better than the first Mad Max in EVERY conceivable way.  The problem with the first Mad Max (and this may just have been budget issues for all I know) is that it NEVER felt like the world in the first movie was a post-apocalyptic world.  It felt like a place where just a few people lived.  There were still houses, pretty much all intact.  So the setting was inconsistent with what the story the movie wanted to present.  The chase scenes, while excellent, just scratched the tip of the iceberg of what could be done.  Again this might probably be budgeting issues.  This movie improves on every single thing that the first movie either did wrong or just neglected to do.  This is why when people think of post-apocalyptic/punk world, they think of Mad Max...or at least Mad Max type settings.  And I really don't think this movie gets the credit it deserves for pretty much revolutionizing the post-apocalyptic sub-genre.  But yea the setting for this movie is just fantastic, and fits in perfectly with this world and these characters that inhabit it.  The costume design is also awesome.  I liked the fact that there was a lot more comedy this time around, which certainly helped keep things not as serious, and it just added a little bit of diversity to the movie.  What I find most impressive, is that they got so much out of so little dialogue.  Granted, the story is pretty simple and incredibly easy to follow.  It's sort of like Yojimbo.  But there's not a whole lot of complex dialogue in this movie, and it never annoyed me because the action pretty much spoke for itself.  What I did find silly, though, is that the character that seemed to get a lot of dialogue ended up being the goofiest character in the entire movie.  And I'm sure you all know who I'm talking about.  Lord Humungus has to be one of the campiest villains I've ever seen.  Thankfully he didn't drive the conflict at all, well he did, but he didn't do it by appearing in 75% of the movie.  He appeared sparingly, but his dialogue was SOOOO fucking campy, it's not even funny.  And I'm not even sure it was a negative, because he was so campy that he was a fun character.  But then again, in a way, it WAS a negative because the villain, in this world, should be a more 'realistic' character.  Now, on to the selling point of this movie.  The car chase sequences are just THE best car chase sequences I've seen in any movie...EVER.  It's actually pretty much art.  There's only 2 of these sequences in the movie, but they're both lengthy (especially the last one) and amazingly choreographed.  But the first chase scene doesn't hold ANYTHING to the second (and MUCH bigger) one.  It went probably 10+ minutes of non-stop action and it was just amazing to behold.  I think the equivalent of nowadays would be in The Matrix Reloaded, that 17 minute action sequence, that's probably the only thing that even comes CLOSE nowadays.  And I enjoyed this one much more because of its lack of CGi, which The Matrix used a lot of.  I just don't even know what to say about this scene other than it's just the best chase sequence I've seen any movie, it's quite frankly worth the price of admission just to see this see, though I watched this movie for free on Encore On Demand (thanks BTW).  So if you have any access to this movie and you haven't seen it yet I don't know what the fuck you are waiting for.  This movie made me SO pumped for Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (which is also playing on Encore On Demand and it's the next movie I'm gonna watch), even though I KNOW it's not as good as this one.  It also made me incredibly pumped for the new Mad Max with Tom Hardy, I can't WAIT for that movie.  So yea, campy villain aside, this movie is fantastic stuff.  Go see it!",

            "content": "The Road Warrior is hands down the best improved sequel I have seen. I considered the original to be just okay, whereas I came out of the second thinking it's possibly the greatest action film ever.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with montage of apocalyptic clips, with a narrative of Max's doings since the events of the first Mad Max. We come to learn that times are hard, and there's a shortage of everything... most importantly: gas. Max travels miles in desperate need of it, but instead finds himself bumping into survivors, something he'd rather not be doing. He learns two gangs who are pretty much the only source of anything are at war. One weaker but contain a huge supply of gas, the other much stronger, but are in demand of it. Max agrees to help the weaker gang for one day, providing he gets the amount of gas he requests.\r\n\r\nUnlike the first, we finally have a full lentgh plot of \"Mad Max\" instead of just plain boring Max. We see that he is still in emotions about his past, and is why he travels alone and socialise as little as possible. Suprisingly, the emotional scenes don't seem cheap or there for mainstream appeal. The apocalyptic setting is absolutely amazing, one of the very best I have seen. Unlike the first, the support characters are much more memorable, including the infant who looks up to Max but is unable to speak, and the crazy inventor who likes to stay out of action, but provides for his people.\r\n\r\nThe car chase is highly influential, but still after all these years arguably the best put to film. Max has to escort cargos of gas safely out of town whilst the opposing gang try to gain it. It becomes WW3 on road. It reaches a fair long time, but never lets up and far any action fan it's likely to be one of the best scenes you'll see.\r\n\r\nThere's no much faults here. It's like the creators took the feedback to improve on the original: the action scenes are more polished, the storyline is less conventional, the support characters have heart, the villains even meaner... Maybe its (very minor) downfall is for such a violent film, it should have strayed from using those silly family friendly moments. But it hardly detracted from the experience. The Road Warrior is everything a sequel should be, and what every action film should follow. I was disappointed with the first, and after having such low expectations, I'm glad I came out of this feeling fufilled.",

            "content": "Mad Max 2 (or The Road Warrior, as it is frequently referred to) is a visually impressive, thinly plotted action movie that does what it sets out to do with a great deal of success. Let it be noted from the start this film isn't trying to be the twentieth century answer to Shakespeare. The objective here is to present high-octane action and stunts in the most eye-popping, visceral manner possible. Within the parameters of its own agenda, Mad Max 2 is a great film. If you come to the film seeking great depth, ongoing characterisation, clever dialogue and such like, you won't find what you're looking for. If you want to experience an exhilarating action film - and, let's face it, we all need to watch films for entertainment every now and again - then Mad Max 2 delivers by the tanker-load! \n\nFollowing the death of his wife and child, former Australian traffic cop Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) has become a scavenger who cruises the lawless roads of post-apocalypse Oz in search of fuel. Every time he finds an abandoned or crashed vehicle, he uses bowls, bottles and other such containers to bleed off whatever precious fuel may be left in it. The roads are riddled with similar scavengers, some of whom are even more violent and desperate than Max. Following a dramatic pursuit against a group that includes the fearsome, mohican-wearing Wez (Vernon Wells), Max befriends a man who pilots a primitive form of chopper, known simply as the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence). The Gyro Captain guides Max to a nearby oil depot in the middle of the desert, populated by a bunch of relatively law-abiding and fair-minded people. However, the depot is under constant threat from a gang of marauders who circle it day and night, taunting those inside with threats of violence and torture, and capturing the desperate few who occasionally try to drive away from the oil compound in a bid for freedom. Among this gang of sadists is Wez, but he is nothing compared to the gang leader - a terrifying masked goliath known as the Humungus (Kjell Nilsson). Max manages to get into the oil depot, where he offers his assistance to the defenders within if they will give him some fuel in return.\n\nMad Max 2 features a number of good points. The costumes are imaginative, the vehicles are intriguing, the setting looks appropriately bleak - while it is most definitely a low-budget film (admittedly, though, slightly more expensive-looking than Part One), the makers have come up with ingenious ways of concealing their limited funds. Performance-wise, the script doesn't ask much of the cast, although Gibson demonstrates a degree of charisma and Spence as the Gyro Captain turns in a weird but arresting acting job. Perhaps the most memorable performance comes from a young lad named Emil Minty, who plays the Feral Kid (a strange, animalistic boy who protects his people with a razor-sharp boomerang!) The stunt work is absolutely incredible, more so when one reflects that there are no fancy computer generated effects here, just a lot of meticulously prepared stunts and crashes performed by a team of extraordinarily brave stunt drivers. Also noteworthy is the intense music by Brian May. Mad Max 2 is violent, trashy, fast-paced fun - a film that doesn't set itself ambitions above its station, and is all the better for it. Perhaps the best of the trilogy.",

            "content": "The Road Warrior is a deft blend of thrilling action, social commentary, and a character piece. It depicts a world thrown into chaos by the loss of our most precious resource-oil. As the film's own opening montage states, it powers the world. As humans, we've come to rely on it for the most basic of tasks, and now there's no question that it's running out. What will happen when it does? The Mad Max series (of which The Road Warrior is the second part) gives a possibility that is both extraordinarily fantastic and frighteningly possible. Nations will collide, and civilization will fall. Gangs roam the wastes to scavenge what little of the fuel is left. Only one thing seems sure-soon all of the stockpiles dry and the car gas tanks will be empty.\r\n\tThe Road Warrior picks up after the events of Mad Max (the details of which I will avoid to spoil), where now we find Max (played once more by Mel Gibson) a loner, roaming the 'wasteland', in search of fuel and peace. He has only his faithful dog with him on his journey across the barren Australian Outback. All of the apparent order that remained in Mad Max seems all but gone now, with the Halls of Justice nowhere in sight. And Max's Interceptor is running on empty. On his search, he comes across a group of people with, seemingly, the last oil drill, and thus source of the fuel. These people are harassed constantly by a gang, led by the poorly named, and attired, Lord Humungus. Through these trials we see a bit more of the character of Max, and why he finds peace in driving the roads of the wastes.\r\n\tThe movie is a huge leap forward from its predecessor in story, character, and how compelling it is. Where part one had me bored for a majority of it, as it seemed like nothing happened, The Road Warrior is nonstop thrills. Slow parts are short, and they're still rarely 'slow'. This is still even for modern standards. Sure it's not Michael Bay or Tony Scott constant breathlessness, but it's certainly more intense than the action films normally being churned out these days. The film tops it all off with a massive set piece of vehicular action. Not to spoil anything, it had me on the edge of my seat for the whole duration. The Road Warriors bigger budget also shows through; there are more cars, more explosions, and just more great ass-kickery all around.\r\n\tBut it still remains a story of humanity. We desire with desperation power, we betray one another, and we need one another. No matter the setting; whether it be post oil-less wasteland or a Romero-style apocalypse, this is what we are. As for 'Mad' Max Rockatansky, the road warrior that he is, well he's just along for the ride.",

The only means to survival in this desolate land is to remain constantly vigilant and on the move. This makes oil and gasoline, outside of food and water, the hottest commodity going. Enter Mad Max, a drifter who lost his wife and child to some violent, motorcycle riding punks. Max now has no purpose in life but to travel the wastelands with his faithful dog and his beat up but reliable hot rod. One day, while trying to salvage some gas from a seemingly abandoned helicopter, Max falls in to a trap laid by a wacky fellow known as the Gyro Captain. Max turns the tables on him but the Gyro Captain buys his continued existence by informing Max of a nearby oil refinery that is still functional and pumping out oodles of petrol. The pair observe the refinery for a while and notice that a group of bandits, led by a chap named Humungus are terrorizing the refinery's inhabitants, attempting to wrest control of the refinery from them by any means necessary. As events unfold Max eventually finds himself somewhat unwillingly aligned with the defenders of the refinery and forms a risky plan to help this tribe escape the tyranny of the bandits permanently by heading north to the promised land. What ensues is one of the most destructive and satisfying chase scenes in the history of film! I love this movie. I remember watching it a lot as a kid with my Dad and I just couldn't get enough! I was always a fan of cars and especially big trucks, so watching a whole film entirely dedicated to them crashing in to each other certainly hit the spot in my books. Watching it again all these years later I like it even more, it was neat to see Mel Gibson as a youngster. I also really liked the actor who played the Gyro Captain, he's been in a ton of good stuff. What I also noticed was how little dialogue there is in this movie, which I really liked. I think Castaway is the only other movie I can think of with as little dialogue. The Road Warrior is all about the walky walky, not the talky talky! I think more films should follow this example . . .",

Mad Max was a smash hit in Australia and the producers wanted to make the 2nd one more for America. So, b/c Americans had not heard of MM2, they came up with the new title. All real live action, no CGI. Even the guy who hits a car with a motorcycle and flies head over heels for 100 ft. Great action sequence of the tanker chase scene lasts over 13 minutes all at speeds of over 60 mph. \n\nGasoline is almost non-existent in post-apocalyptic Australia, so bands of thieves ride around trying to steal. A band of people who have an oil rig have converted thousands of gallons to gas and plan to drive it to the coast where they will live in paradise. Max finds this group and vows to help them obtain a truck that can haul the tanker. In return, he just wants his car back and all the \"juice\" he can carry. The band of thieves, headed by Humungus, plan to break into their compound and steal their gas. Needless to say, the ensueing battle is violent and awesome. A must see or see it again.",

            "content": "Pseudo futuristic films can have a haunting effect on us. Why? It is quite simple. More often than not, they give us haunting glances into the future of our societies. Whether its the grim chaos of \u0093Children of Men,\u0094 the decrepit and over populated Los Angeles (suffocated by ever present clouds of smog) of \u0093Bladerunner,\u0094 or the filthy, poverty stricken shanties of Neil Blomkamp's \u0093District 9;\u0094 they all grant us a rather pessimistic, however not too unlikely, vision of our futures. They allow us to examine a more barbaric and darker side of our human condition. \u0093The Road Warrior\u0094 seems like it's trying to do the things these films do. However, I think it got a little too caught up in its aesthetic and forgot about almost everything else.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of \u0093The Road Warrior,\u0094 we watch haunting imagery and listen to an old man that tells us of a great war that threw the world into a an oblivion, wiping out almost the entire population, leaving few alive. He then tells us of how gangs and other such people began to rise to power, repressing and taking advantage of the weak, finally then, he tells us of the legendary Road Warrior and how his wife and child were murdered by these viscous gangs. Of course, this leads to his becoming the road warrior but I think that's obvious here: it is Mel Gibson after all. Anyhow, years later he is now a driving about the Australian outback, presumably because he has some unsettled business with the major gang of that area, looking for some gas. A man he has captured tells him of a small refinery fighting off hoards of automobile loving gang members. Max is intrigued so he scouts out the refinery, looking at all the many, many gang members laying siege to the refinery he can already tell it will be no easy task retrieving gas from them.\r\n\r\nThe premise of \u0093The Road Warrior\u0094 seems to be brimming with potential: limited resources under contention between two desperate groups of people and a morally lost man getting caught up in the chaos of it all. \u0093The Road Warrior\u0094 could have taken itself in any number of haunting and pessimistic directions. Alas, though, as I mentioned earlier it gets caught up in its aesthetic. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, right? Just take a look at \u0093Bladerunner,\u0094 the film practically sold itself on its environment and aesthetic alone though. Here's the key difference though: \u0093Bladerunner's\u0094 aesthetic made sense. \u0093The Road Warrior's doesn't. In Bladerunner, the people of Los Angeles wore mismatched, oddly colored, and old clothing because that was all they had. In addition, they lived in or sought out refuge in the decaying lower buildings of Los Angeles, further emphasizing their poverty. Also we as an audience can see that they live in claustrophobic conditions, walking shoulder to shoulder in crowded public streets. All these elements, the art direction, costume design, and extras, worked in tandem to create an unforgettable world that became all the more haunting by its adherence to realism. \u0093The Road Warrior\u0094 on the other hand: its antagonist all dressed like they were hardcore patrons attending a heavy-metal concert or weirdos that randomly selected costumes and trinkets out of a strange sex-shop. The leader of the gang wears a Jason-esque hockey mask, has an incredibly toned body, and wears nothing more than leather underwear resembling the spartan loin cloth from \u0093300.\u0094 The main antagonist has a pink Mohawk, draws eyebrows onto his forehead with makeup, and has a loose pants flap over his butt. However, the gang does reflect its absurdness of style in their actions; though at this point I don't think its necessarily a good things. See, gas is a valuable commodity in the region, the gangs need it so they can properly rule over their wasteland, and the people in the refinery need it so they can make a break for the coast. The gang however, doesn't seem to manifest their need of gas besides attacking the refinery. They seem to be searching for reasons to just jump on their vehicles (which also reflect their absurdness in style) and chase things, do tricks, or just kick some dust up into the air. Though, I don't think I would have minded all of its absurdness if it wasn't for a few scenes and characters that made the film seem as if it was trying to be realistic.\r\n\r\nThere is a scene near the beginning where the people of the refinery send out a few vehicles to try and make it to the coast. They are all stopped and ransacked by the gang of course, but for one vehicle it takes and especially nasty turn: the car it overturned, its passengers are taken out, one is then discovered to be a woman, the other a man. The gang members pin the man to the car with crossbow bolts, then rape and kill the woman. It is without a doubt the most horrifying scene of the film, and it sets a serious tone that all the art direction, costume design, and extras defy. In addition, the man that Max finds and holds captive is dressed up like a true apocalypse survivor, he wears mismatched clothing (tight yellow pants, a big heavy trench coach, and I if I remember correctly pink converse), has ugly, rotting teeth, and looks like he hasn't bathed since running water stopped working, which in this world was a long, long, time ago. These two early, principle elements set a tone for the film that ultimately it cannot live up to.\r\n\r\nI can bet there are some people out there that will say things like \u0093give the movie a break, its just tryin' to have a some fun.\u0094 To such people, I say this: I am in no opposition to fun. I rejoice in my cinematic junk food. But watching \u0093The Road Warrior\u0094 is like biting into a carrot that is secretly disguised as a snickers. It yields little in benefiting your health and only gets in the way of the snickers.",

You could just tell that this film is uberkinetic and makes something new out of combining different film trademarks that we all know separately, like the original did, and is notably borrowed in movies from then to now (the first two films basically defined Australian filmmaking).

So, there you go. \r\n\r\n\r\nActing: It's a cheesy post-apocalyptic 80's B-movie. Marlon Brando grade acting isn't really needed. However, the acting was good enough for the film. Mel Gibson does a good job as the silent Road Warrior. the rest of the cast was decent too. Yeah. It was good enough. 9.5/10\r\n\r\nPlot: It is a dystopian post-apocalyptic Australia (who even knew that Australia could be dystopian. With the exception of A Clockwork Orange, all the other dystopian movies were set in America. I thought it was like spaceships visiting Earth, it can only happen to America. forgive my brief humor). However, things haven't really changed in certain fronts. everybody's still clamoring for gasoline. The plot is good, easy to follow, and entertaining. perfect for a B-movie. 10/10\r\n\r\nScreenplay: again it's pretty standard B-movie stuff. There are no lines that are cringe worthy which is always nice. There are also no lines that will make the top 100 list of best lines for the American Film Institute (aside from the fact that this is an Australian film of course). It's good enough. 9/10\r\n\r\nLikableness: very likable. The Mad Max films are excellent films. I am really glad that I have seen all of them now. Are they perfect films? of course not! Are they ideal films for a Saturday night with your buddies and you don't really want to watch anything deep or award winning and you just want to shut down and watch some great action? yep. Perfect for that. 10/10\r\n\r\nFinal Score: 38.5/40 96% (N)\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIVIA TIME: 1. In one scene, Max eats a can of \"Dinki-Di\" dog food. \"Dinki-Di\" is Australian slang for \"genuine, real.\" (I'll leave you to draw your own conclusion.) \r\n\r\n2. The dog used in the film, named simply \"Dog\", was obtained from a local dog pound and trained to perform in the film. Because the sound of the engines upset him (and in one incident, caused him to relieve himself in the car), he was fitted with special earplugs. After filming was complete, he was adopted by one of the camera operators. \r\n\r\n3. According to trivia book \"Movie Mavericks\" by Jon Sandys, one of the more spectacular stunts in the film was actually a serious accident. One of the motorcycle-riding raiders hits a car, flies off the bike, smashes his legs against the car, and cartwheels through the air towards the camera. This was a real, genuine accident: the stuntman was supposed to just fly over the car WITHOUT hitting it. But the near-fatal incident looked so dramatic that it was kept in the movie. The stuntman broke his leg badly, but survived. (If you look at the stuntman's body frame-by-frame through his cartwheels, you can see that one of his legs is bending at a slightly unnatural angle around the knee...ouch.) \r\n\r\n4. Although it might not look it, the location was actually extremely cold. Mel Gibson would spend his time in between takes huddled under blankets despite being kitted out in a leather outfit.\r\n\r\n5. Mel Gibson only had 16 lines of dialogue in the entire film, and two of them were: \"I only came for the gasoline.",

You can call Mad Max the Gary Cooper of the series. The Road Warrior is the Clint Eastwood. A mysterious stranger that rolls into town for his own gain, yet winds up helping the locals against the tyranny of a menacing force. Think A Fistful of Dollars.\n\n \n\nAfter a little explanation on why in the hell this guy is driving around the desert in a mid '70's Ford Falcon the film opens with a chase. This is no Smokey and the Bandit chase unless Buford T. Justice is sporting a mohawk and assless chaps. Max (Mel Gibson) disposes of his foes in his usual style and proceeds through the wasteland he wanders since the death of his family. He eventually stumbles on an oil and gas refinery that is being terrorized by a group of marauders led by a muscle bound freak in a hockey mask (this was pre-Friday the 13th Part 3 by the way). They want the \"juice\". The people inside want to keep it. Max devises a plan where they can move their gas while filling up his tanks. You just know that means massive crashes and extraordinary deaths. This is Mad Max we're talking about.\n\n\nGrittier than the first film, The Road Warrior is a fast paced, high octane monster that comes roaring out at you from its first moments until the massive climax at the end. As I said before, the story is old and basic, but the visuals and especially the stunt work and driving move this beyond the many B westerns that used the same plot devices. Even after multiple viewings this is still an amazing film to watch just for the pure excitement of it. Perfectly executed by director George Miller, some may be turned off by the S&M wardrobe and lack of dialogue from the lead. It doesn't matter. The Road Warrior is a fire breathing monster that will keep you on the edge of your seat with a nice script, beautiful direction, and some of the greatest car chase sequences ever put to film.",

            "content": "I remember seeing this film on VHS video at a friend\u0092s house almost 30 years ago. At the time I was most impressed with the action sequences and with the futuristic setting of the story. Since then I have seen it a few times, but for the first time I watched it today with a different perspective. Here\u0092s a bit about the plot and then I\u0092ll tell you what I mean.\r\n\r\nThe story follows on from the 1979 film Mad Max, also directed by George Miller. I won\u0092t go through the events that happened there, but I will tell you that former cop, Max, is now wandering the wastelands, a lawless desert. Here, after a run-in with some scavengers, he comes across The Gyro Captain, the pilot of a gyro-copter. He tells Max of a compound in the middle of the desert where the people there are pumping oil and refining it. With fuel being the most valuable commodity in the wastelands, Max is very interested in this place. They go there to find it under siege by the same scavengers that Max had a run-in with earlier. They are led by a character known as The Humungus. Max makes his way into the compound where he discovers they have a tanker but no truck to drive it. He has seen one out on the road and makes a deal for as much fuel he can carry, if he can retrieve it. I won\u0092t say any more, I think that\u0092s enough to whet your appetite.\r\n\r\nAlthough it does look a little dated, this is still a very well made film. It\u0092s not perfect by any means, but the stunt work, the acting and the humour all stand up today. It is not heavy on dialogue, but I could not fault any of the performances, so honourable mentions go to; Mel Gibson as Mad Max Rockatansky, Bruce Spence as The Gyro Captain, Michael Preston as Pappagallo, Max Phipps as The Toadie, Vernon Wells as Wez, Kjell Nilsson as The Humungus and Emil Minty as The Feral Kid.\r\n\r\nI talked about perspective at the beginning and I think I should explain what I mean. Since I have been putting my thoughts online, for just over a year now, I have found that I watch films with a more critical eye. What I mean is I pay more attention to how they make me feel, to how they are made and to whether I find them entertaining.\r\n\r\nSo, I found Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior to have a lot more humour in it than I remember, although some of the stunts didn\u0092t quite work and you can see where the action has been sped up to cover for this. Having said that, the story is great and it is told in a very clever way with just the right balance of humour and drama in and amongst the action. Entertaining throughout, and, given the limitations the filmmakers had at the time, a very well made and ambitious film. Over all, I loved it when I first saw it, and love it just as much today! Recommended.\r\n\r\nMy score: 7.8/10",

George Miller pulls out all his tricks to create one mean, thrilling action packed sequel that has some of the best action sequences ever filmed. The Road Warrior is one amazing film, a lot of fun with plenty off good acting. This film is also bizarre cinema at it's finest. The Road Warrior setting is a post apocalyptic landscape where gasoline is the the currency, and salvaging what you can to survive. The Road Warrior is an impressive film in scope, and the villains here are some of the most memorable villains to grace a film series. The Road Warrior is an adrenaline fueled an under George Miller's direction, he delivers something unique, intense and jaw dropping. I loved the first one, but The Road Warrior blew it out of the water. Very much like what The Dark Knight did with Batman Begins. The Road Warrior ranks up there as one of the best car chase film, as the ones delivered here are quite possibly the best that I have ever seen. The Road Warrior will definitely appeal to every action junkie out there. Geoirge Miller has crafted a masterpiece with The Road Warrior, and its a classic of the genre. What makes this film so great is the fact that they were able to pull out something great with a bare bones, striipped down plot. The results are very impressive, and the film is purely and simply a masterful action film.  A definite must watch.",

We tend to write off action sequences as mindless, but if you think about this movie's sequences, you will realize that simply from a techincal perspective they took an immense amount of skill to make. The stunts and editing are fantastic. The world of the movie is also fairly well thought-out: a postapocalyptic nightmare where people cling to whatever clothes and machines have survived.

With a bigger budget, writer/director George Miller takes the original to another level. While the first one felt like a western with a gang of psychopathic bikers, the sequel gets much of its influence from not only westerns of the past but also the samurai films by Akira Kurosawa as Max is almost like Toshiro Mifune\u00e2(TM)s ronin from Yojimbo; and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name character from Leone's Dollars Trilogy seems like a distant relative of Gibson's Max in some ways as he's drifting along in the post-apocalyptic Australian wasteland. Most of the first half isn't really filled with a whole lot of action but once Max gets on the road inside of a big rig, Miller cranks the action up to 11. Also, Brian May's score is an improvement on his music from the first film and isn't as distracting. This is an all out classic that has lasted the test of time thanks to Mel Gibson's definitive role and George Miller's exciting filmmaking. It is a top of the line action picture. 10/10",

Although I knew that the world for Mad Max would change in the sequel, I didn't know how they would sell it- but it worked. \n         Bigger budget this time around and Mel Gibson looks harder and tougher with his roughed-up outfit and stubble. There is more violence, with more car chases and bigger explosions. Its an action movie of the old-school with a single-minded protagonist, get the fuel and keep on the road.\n     Alas, Max finds himself in a deal to help a band of noble peeps escape from the bad guys with cross-bows (and pretty rad outfits) who want their gas. The stand-off between the base of people and impending army of bad guys with Max there to save the day reminded me a lot of Bruce Campbell in Army of Darkness.\n        The plot is thin but its a hell of a lot of fun, especially for an action movie from the seventies on a Australian film budget. Miller really lifts his game since the first flick and so do the stunt people who perform some pretty crazy acts of craziness.\n         Check it out, it's one of films you have to see- then you can go back to the first movie if your interest is sparked. Good times... it's a shame Aussie movies like this aren't made anymore.",

When the micro-budgeted \"Mad Max\" went huge all around the world, writer-director George Miller was granted a budget effectively thirty times the amount of the original film.  This is what resulted - a movie with the absolute barest possible bones of plot and dialogue, but one that you walk away from with a big, goofy grin on your face.  Everyone is free to interpret the story (group of marauders refining gasoline in a fuel-hungry world fight off repeated attacks from bloodthirsty, warmongering outsiders), but what can't be debated is this movie's effectiveness as an action film.  The best car chases ever put to film, a badass antihero in Gibson's Max, and pure moviemaking carnage are on display for all to see here.",
