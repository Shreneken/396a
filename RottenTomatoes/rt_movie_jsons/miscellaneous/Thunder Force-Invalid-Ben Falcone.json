            "content": "Back to the well.  So this story takes place in a world where superpowers exist, but only sociopaths have them, so it leads to a bunch of villains running amuck.  A determined scientist (Octavia Spencer) has been working tirelessly for years on a treatment that could give everyday people superpowers.  The only trouble is that her long-lost clumsy friend (Melissa McCarthy) accidentally gives herself one of the two doses.  It looks like they have no choice but to train, team up, and take down bad guys.  Now I'm going to level with you: I was not looking forward to this.  I think Melissa McCarthy is talented, but much like Adam Sandler, she knows what pays her bills.  For every great movie she makes, there are eight lazy ones, and in case you couldn't tell from the trailers and posters, this is one of the eight.  Now even comic book fans would agree that superheroes are oversaturated at this point.  There's just so much content out there that it even takes some willpower to watch something worthwhile like Falcon and the Winter Soldier.  If you don't already have the built-in audience that comes with Marvel, you have to bring something fresh to the table, like Invincible.  The whole concept of Thunder Force feels about a decade too late.  I believe that to successfully do a parody, you either need to have the teeth for biting humor or a genuine love for the genre that you are parodying.  Thunder Force has neither.  It's just another Melissa McCarthy vehicle, and she is doing everything that she has built her career around.  You've got gross-out food gags, and you've got pratfalls.  You've got her being loud, obnoxious, and unaware, and you even get some impressions that she makes over and over again, long past the point any other director would have yelled cut.  This movie is directed by her husband, Ben Falcone, which explains a whole lot.  It's her front and center, and it is to the point that everyone surrounding her is only given one thing to do.  Even Octavia Spencer (who is headlining in this, mind you) is completely wasted and pushed to the background.  Jason Bateman and Bobby Cannavale also support, but they are only asked to play the roles that they built their entire career upon.  Other recognizable faces pop up, but I promise you that you're not even going to remember that they were ever in this if you can give this two weeks.  With Thunder Force, I found myself waiting for the punchlines that never came, and I kept asking myself where the jokes were.  There is too much weak improv, and every scene goes on for about two minutes longer than it should.  Unsurprisingly, this feels far longer than it actually is, and it makes me yearn for something like Project Power, which comes as a complete surprise to me.  Thunder Force never made me overly angry, but I did feel like my time got wasted.",

Not every superhero movie should be. \n\nCome to think of it, this movie had a lot in common with the all-female Ghostbusters film that everyone trashed. It has the same strong friendships between middle-aged women who aren't conventionally attractive and don't try to be or care to be... who are fighting supernatural forces... men who are almost solely there to be villains or love interests... women getting to just, you know, have a fun movie that doesn't have to be about objectification. \n\nI get it.

            "content": "IN A NUTSHELL:\nYep, it's been 5 minutes so that means it's time for another superhero movie. But wait, this one is different. The idea behind this Netflix story is decent, but the execution is, sadly, lacking. Melissa McCarthy is married to the writer/director, Ben Falcone, who admitted this was the fastest he had ever written a film...and it shows. He exclaimed that he loves comics and superheroes, so it's a shame that he couldn't spend more time creating an actual decent script. You're going to laugh a couple of times during the action-comedy, but you'll also roll your eyes in the many cringe-worthy moments of this disappointing movie...\n\nTHINGS I LIKED:\nMelissa McCarthy is hilarious and I really love her, but whenever she stars in movies that her husband writes and directs, the films tend to bomb. In this movie, she shines doing her classic physical humor but the script is a big mess.\n\nSome have speculated why Academy Award-winning Octavia Spencer would agree to this role; however, she and Melissa McCarthy have been friends in real life for 20 years. I'm assuming she just wanted to try something very different and lend her high-status name to the production. She and Melissa McCarthy also both showcase their daughters in this film. Melissa also featured her daughter, Vivian Falcone, in the movie The Boss.\n\nMelissa Leo also won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 2011, but has a very small role in this film.\n\nSome of the banter is pretty entertaining.\n\nJason Bateman is always funny, although his character in this film is pretty bizarre. I thought he and Melissa McCarthy were pretty magical together in the movie Identity Thief.\n\nI don't think I had ever seen French actress Pom Klementieff without her green makeup and antennae as Mantis from Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical), (I LOVE that franchise!), so it took me a minute to realize she was the one playing the character Laser.\n\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nI had done a trailer reaction for this film a while ago and thought the trailer looked pretty funny with some potential. Of course, knowing a little bit about the film's writer/director made me worry just a bit, so I had my fingers crossed. Unfortunately, my concerns were justified. The film is just completely disappointing on so many levels.\n\nYou don't need X-ray vision to see what's going to happen next.\n\nThe villains and their powers are pretty lame.\n\nA lot of the humor doesn't land at all and is extremely juvenile. A lot of it is improvisation, which simply didn't work, nor entertain.\n\nThe character development isn't well defined.\n\nThe first half of the movie takes way too much time to show us how Melissa McCarthy gets superpowers and we wonder if there is going to be anything more to the schtick. She kind of plays the same character in every movie, so this character just felt worn out much of the time.\n\nSo much exposition.\n\nThere are some super-gross moments regarding raw chicken when people eat it. It's supposed to be funny, but it's not. Even worse is that it goes on and on forever. The good news is that the actors were NOT actually eating raw chicken, but a carefully camouflaged Asian pear. Whew! Rumor has it that even knowing it was pieces of Asian pear, the actors still had a hard time eating it in their scenes. Yuck.\n\nYou can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",

It had spots of funny, weirdness and even some gross humor I shut my eyes for but it was still funny. Plot, character development and dialogue amongst supporting cast could have been better. McCarthy, Bateman and a few others are blessed with charisma and it showed. This reminded me of a mid-level Adam Sandler movie, like 50 First Dates or something.

The CGI felt weird with Laser as well. I wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't However, I did like that training montage and the friendship that Lydia had with Emily and the girl felt real.

Algunas escenas realmente muy graciosas quedan medio perdidas, como sueltas, en una película que parece decidirse más por la comedia sentimental que por la parodia y sale perdiendo.\n\n\nReseña\n\nUna radiación cósmica convierte a algunos seres humanos en malhechores con determinados poderes. Años después, una científica y un amiga de su infancia de reencuentran y por accidente terminan formando un escuadrón de superheroínas que se enfrentan a un candidato a intendente de Chicago.\n\nMelisa McCarthy y su esposo Ben Falcone (director y guinista) constituyen una dupla artística con varios títulos en su haber, basados en el carisma y la indudable gracia de la primera.\n\nEn este caso, Fuerza Trueno parece un collage de dos películas diferentes que no terminan de combinarse: una comedia sentimental sobre el reencuentro de dos amigas (una exitosa, la científica Emily , a cargo de Octavia Spencer, y otra no tanto, Lydia, interpretada por McCarthy) y una comedia paródica sobre dos superheroínas obesas de diseño (cercana en estilo a la maravillosa Spy, también protagonizada por McCarthy pero dirigida por Paul Feig), . Es como si hubiera una indecisión por parte del director entre filmar una película en serio sobre superhérores o una parodia sobre ellos (una síntesis que si logra Shazam!, por ejemplo).\n\nPero la parte \"seria\" resulta bastante anodina y uno queda, en cambio deseando más momentos graciosos, que los hay y mucho. También están logrados las escenas de acción y sus efectos especiales.\n\nContribuye al resultado general la actuación de Octavia Spencer, que mantiene el mismo registro desganado durante toda la película, con escasa química con su coequiper; como si la comedia no fuese lo suyo. No tienen desperdicio, en cambio, las escenas con Jason Batman, que derrocha química y gracia. \n\n\n\n\n(Spanish / English)\n\nA film that seems to decide more on sentimental comedy than parody and loses.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nFailed comedy with Melissa McCarthy and a reluctant Octavia Spencer as two designer superheroes. Some really very funny scenes are half lost, like loose, in a movie that seems to decide more on sentimental comedy than parody and loses.\n\n\nReview\n\nA cosmic radiation turns some human beings into evildoers with certain powers. Years later, a scientist and a childhood friend meet again and by accident end up forming a squad of superheroines who face a candidate for mayor of Chicago.\n\nMelisa McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone (director and screenwriter) are an artistic duo with several titles to their credit, based on the charisma and undoubted grace of the former.\n\nIn this case, Thunder Force looks like a collage of two different films that do not finish combining: a sentimental comedy about the reunion of two friends (one successful, the scientist Emily, by Octavia Spencer, and the other not so much, Lydia, played by McCarthy) and a parodic comedy about two obese designer superheroines (close in style to the marvelous Spy, also starring McCarthy but directed by Paul Feig),. It is as if there is an indecision on the part of the director between filming a serious movie about superheroes or a parody about them (a synthesis that Shazam! Can achieve, for example).\n\nBut the \"serious\" part is quite anodyne and one is left, instead wishing for more funny moments, which there are and a lot. The action scenes and their special effects are also achieved.\n\nContributing to the overall result is the performance of Octavia Spencer, who maintains the same listless register throughout the film, with little chemistry with her coequiper; as if comedy wasn't his thing. On the other hand, the scenes with Jason Batman, which exudes chemistry and grace, are not wasted.",

            "content": "I feel like we were just here a matter of months ago, another aimless Melissa McCarthy comedy vehicle written and directed by her husband and chief enabler, Ben Falcone. With Thunder Force, McCarthy becomes an accidental superhero and that premise should be enough with this star to power a silly and amusing 90 minutes of entertainment. Once again it's a dispiriting comedy that feels like it's just sitting around and waiting for the performers to find something funny in their scenes and family-friendly improv ramblings. The energy of this movie is completely slack, and scenes feel adrift, lacking proper direction or purpose. The whole movie feels gassed and grasping. It takes 45 minutes for McCarthy to train to be a hero and sometimes there just aren't jokes. Take one instance where McCarthy literally throws a bus, a point strangely referred to multiple times earlier as a setup for this long-desired moment, and then under Falcone's uninspired direction we don't even see the messy results. We don't even see the bus crashing into, like, an orphanage or something that would provide an actual punchline. The comedy malpractice can be staggering. It's the kind of movie that resorts to characterization where everything is clumsily reported to us, like, \"You've always been this way since...\" The chemistry between McCarthy and Octavia Spencer (The Witches) is lukewarm at best for these longtime friends. The buddy comedy doesn't even seem like it was developed beyond its initial pitch. The shining light of this movie is easily Jason Bateman (Ozark), who plays a crab-armed mutant criminal that becomes an improbable romantic suitor for McCarthy's character. If there is anything that made me laugh, it was related to this character (and an ordinary henchman named Andrew who may or may not be targeted as the next to get killed by his evil boss played by Bobby Cannavale). I even loved the simple image of Bateman crab walking off screen with his arms in the air. The sheer weirdness is enough to make you realize what potential could have been tapped with this super premise and with McCarthy, who can be so charming and disarming when she gives into her odd impulses. Just give me a full movie where a middle-aged superwoman tries to make a relationship with a crab-man super villain work. I wish that Thunder Force had more courage to chase its weird rather than settle, time and again, as an action comedy that is middling with its action and middling with its comedy. I think I had more fun with 2020's Super Intelligence, another mediocre Falcone collaboration.\n\nNate's Grade: C",

Alas, it's just dumb. Playing two life-long friends who part ways after high school, McCarthy is the typically under-achieving Lydia, the bumbling but good-hearted idiot she has played a million times before, while Spencer is Emily, the over-achieving scientist who has devoted her life to fight the super-villainous Miscreants by inventing a way to give regular folks superpowers. The film strives to be a Spy or The Heat, i.e. one of those good McCarthy comedies that made her a star, but with overworked jokes, a script that rarely makes much sense as a dramatic thriller and not out-there enough to be the super-surreal silly comedy that it can otherwise be, this ends up a missed opportunity to poke fun at the superhero genre and give the buddy-cop movie a modern makeover with two talented female stars. Other talents in the form of Jason Bateman and Melissa Leo are similarly wasted here and the fault lies firmly with writer-director, and husband of McCarthy, Ben Falcone. If I can overlook his pedestrian point-and-shoot directing, it's impossible to do the same for his lazy and lacklustre script that fails to mine properly the comedic potential of two middle-aged women playing superheroes. The film certainly begins promisingly, I even laughed a few times and its gamed cast has chemistry with each other and deserves better. For there's a decent film buried somewhere beneath all the misplaced sense of humour and the irritatingly contrived and half-baked plotting. Moreover, McCarthy needs better quality control to stop these weak comedies from overwhelming her filmography.",

Love it! \n\nI was pretty much bored from start to finish. The jokes were so horrendous and lame, even though some got me chuckled a little bit. Pretty much everything in the movie was a cliche: the plot, story, characters, villains, dialogues, even the freaking TITLE. And oh boi they tried to connect to us youngsters by having Melissa McCarthy play Fortnite, a pretty-much-dying game. What a way to attract audiences. \n\nThis is like a bunch of Karens trying to be edgy and relatable to the kiddos. Gosh it's painful. \n\nAs much as I hate McCarthy's comedy, I don't get why other great actors like Octavia Spencer and Jason Bateman signed up for this lame stuff. \n\nAt the end, I had some tears, because I was sleepy trying to finish this boring \"comedy\" and I was glad it's over. \n\nPlease McCarthy and Falcone just stop making these trash and waste of time movies. \n\nI wanted to rant even though I'm sleepy as heck. But it's over. 1/10",

But they don't get going until 44 minutes into a less than 2 hr movie. There is a really long training montages that takes up a good part of the second act. \nIf the Miscreants are a threat why are they taking their time? They don't seem terribly worried about the enemy. This makes it boring to watch. \nIt's sort of like an improv show about this concept got filled out as a series of sketches by someone who doesn't understand story well enough to make an interesting movie-- and I say that as someone who loves improv-- but its application here leaves a lot to be desired.",

A film that cross-checks every requirement for a Razzies contender, something quite familiar for the writer-director and his wife, Melissa McCarthy, who keeps doing favors. Despite an admittedly decent first act, the rest of the film goes downhill concerning its entertainment value. Honestly, I don't know what's worse: witnessing McCarthy and Octavia Spencer waste her exceptional talent in nonsensical movies or seeing major studios continue to give opportunities to filmmakers that have nothing important to say while necessary, significant voices are still out there waiting desperately for their shot. The best compliment I can give this Netflix product is that it doesn't mislead anyone: it's precisely what viewers expect it to be, whether that's nice or horrible.\"",
