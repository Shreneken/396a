If they had given the lead role to a playboy playmate,  some baywatch actress,  or even a model like Cindy Crawford, they would have benefited more out of it, even though it still would have been a terrible movie. I mean considering the cast they got for its time, if they gave us the art and passion of strippers , maybe it would have been a solid but really strippers seem were a subplot and it was just a side hustle for the main character.  Props to demi for committing to the part. Surprised she didn't take this as a profession after her career pretty much died after this",

Demi was honestly hotter in G.I. Jane as far as this poop show goes, but, it's a so-bad-it's-good flick.\n\nThe most important missing aspect from these stripper films is the 40-something dancer, and her name is Karen...yes, THAT Karen. She's a former crackhead turned soprano with her community choir, and since she can no longer command the attention of college boys, she does a backbend on stage and then crab walks around naked while yodeling at top volume until someone throws a dollar at her naked cooch. \n\nIf you're thinking of hitting up the sex industry while you're hot and 20, just remember the Karen that waits for you at the end of the line, and you hafta stare at her in that huge mirror behind you as you dance on stage--none of it glamorous. Although, if you do enough crack, I'm sure you can imagine it's all champagne wishes and caviar dreams!",

            "content": "Time to see more of Demi Moore (pun definitely intended) with the movie that started the nail on the coffin of her acting career, Striptease. Based on the book by Carl Hiaasen, the movie follows Erin Grant (Demi Moore) an FBI agent-turned stripper who's in the middle of a custody battle over her daughter (Rumer Willis) with the help of Lieutenant Al Garcia (Armand Assante). However, said battle requires a visit to Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) as she conjures a plan to remove him from office after one patron who volunteered as an insider was murdered. Unlike Showgirls, which was a drama and tries to take itself seriously, Striptease is a comedy with satirical jabs at corrupt Floridian politicians. The main problem with the film, however, is that the tone is all over the map, as it cannot decide whether to be funny or serious. That tonal shift might have been caused by Demi Moore, who knew too well about Erin and made her into a radical feminist who opposes her job. Meanwhile, she's surrounded by wacky comic minor characters like Shad the bouncer (Ving Rhimes) and her ex-husband Darrell (Robert Patrick). Part of me wanted to laugh because these minor characters from the book do deserve fit on the big screen, but when Erin's arc came, the movie fell apart. I swear, half the time, I kept wondering why she chose a cushy strip joint like the Eager Beaver instead of staying in the FBI. Despite Hiaasen's approval of the film adaptation, Striptease is a mess and did not live up to its potential as a hilarious political satire. (1 Shawshank Redemption Poster out of 5)",

The ideas are unfocused and thinly sketched, lacking the precision needed for well-balanced satire, and the screenplay is dead in the water, just a jumble of scenes and words that barely scrape together a coherent narrative. By and large the supporting cast, when they clue in to what film they should be making, hit the right tone-especially Reynolds, who is the very definition of a buffoon, a practically classical portrayal of political power gone stupid-but the biggest problem lies right at the heart of the film with Moore. Everything rests on her character and her performance, and with the exception of the dance sequences-the best bits of the film by far, thanks in no small part to Moore's considerable dancing skills-Moore is just too dour for this semi-comic material. Yet what is worse, and where the film fails most spectacularly, is in the very character that Moore plays: While the filmmakers obviously imagine her as some sort of feminist firebrand, defending her daughter and rebuilding her life, the fact is that she is only seen through the male gaze, reduced to being the contradiction of both madonna and whore.",

However, the tone of the film wasn't quite right and it send up nowhere as good as Hiaasen's book. Similar to Elmore Leonard books, which for years had failed film adaptations until \"Jackie Brown\" and \"Out of Sight,\" Hiaasen mixes humor and crime stories, often with a wide menagerie of colorful characters, in a way that's hard to translate to film. In a story that mostly revolves around Demi Moore having to strip in order to make a living wage in order to get her daughter back from her crazed ex-husband who has custody. There are also plot threads involving the various characters at the Eager Beaver strip club, a cop (the underused Armand Assante), but the best is Burt Reynolds as the lecherous Senator Dilbeck. Compared to \"Jackie Brown\" and \"Out of Sight,\" those films weren't playing for laughs, whereas the actors in this film were. The other films let the situations create the twisted laughs, whereas this film had characters with silly haircuts and broad performances that made the film seem pretty lightweight.",

            "content": "Um... What The Hell was that? Seriously, what did I just watch? Striptease really has no identity and no clear purpose. Was it a Crime Drama? Because it wasn't suspenseful. Was it a Comedy? Because it wasn't funny. Striptease is just a long and confusing mess. I don't know where to start with this film. It just seems so misplaced with little to no structure. Okay... I'll do the best I can with this THING. \n\nErin Grant (Demi Moore) is a divorced mother who wants sole custody of her daughter. Somehow through an interesting and stupid contrivance, Erin loses her job as a secretary for the FBI. In  order to pay bills and survive, she takes a job as a stripper at the \"Eager Beaver\" (I don't care how sleazy a strip club is, why would you name an establish \"Eager Beaver\"?) Anyway, there are a lot of subplots including a murder, an annoying congressman (Burt Reynolds), a bouncer taking up space, Erin's ex husband acting like a moron for the entire movie and of course we have to put up with the Erin's general stupidity. Yes, you've probably spotted the first problem with Striptease... TOO MUCH IS GOING ON!  This film has too many subplots even for characters we don't give a crap about. Why should I care about the bouncer guy and whatever he has going on? Why should I care about anything Erin's Ex Husband is doing?  Hell, it's hard for me to even care about Erin herself. The point is, there are a lot of scenes that should've been trimmed or cut entirely. \n\nThe sad thing is the acting by almost the entire cast is pretty solid. Whether it be the dramatic moments or the comedic moments, the actors and actresses in this movie try their hardest to make their characters believable  or at the very least bearable. I only have two complaints when it comes the acting component of this film. First of all, what is Burt Reynolds doing here? Talk about a totally phoned in  performance with a huge annoyance factor. Second of all, Demi Moore... is just on autopilot in this movie. I didn't believe her even for a single moment. I never saw her as a character, I just saw her as Demi Moore which seems to happen a lot in whatever movie she's in. So yes, Moore truly was the worst actress in this film. \n\nNow when it comes the actual story of Striptease, it just comes off confusing and tonally cluttered. There were obviously moments of intentional comedy, but none of the comedic scenes were funny at all. Most of the time, the comedy in this was painful... ESPICALLY when Burt Reynolds was involved. The only time I laughed was when it was unintentional. For instance, Demi Moore's \"dancing\" in this movie absolutely hilarious! It was like she was a bird having a seizure or something. I'll put it this way, Elizabeth Berkley is a better dancer than Demi Moore. Oh yes...  I SAID IT! \n\nSo we've come to the biggest issue of Striptease. What exactly is this movie's purpose? What exactly is the point of this entire film? Like I said, sometimes it tries to take itself seriously other times it's almost trying to be a dark comedy. Sure, a film can pull off both if it had the proper talent behind the script and the camera. However, it just seemed like writer/director Andrew Bergman got bored with the movie he was writing and just threw random stuff together hoping it would be just clever and funny all on it's own. In the end, Striptease just seems like a total waste of film. \n\nEven though I wouldn't call Striptease the worst movie I've ever seen, it was still a huge waste of time. There was clearly effort put in to this film and like I said the acting isn't all bad. However we still have to sit through bad writing, a confusing plot, really awful performances from both Demi Moore and Burt Reynolds, characters we don't care for or relate to and of course the painfully unfunny scenes. In short, Striptease is just a really stupid movie. Not the Worst, but definitely not worth your time or money.",

This was a massively hyped film, and for a film which is supposed to be a sex comedy, it's laughs come in all the wrong places and it just comes across as both dull and over the top at the same time, and there are moments that are just embarrassing. In Florida, FBI secretary Erin Grant (Demi Moore) has lost her job, and in an unfair custody battle, has lost her daughter Angela (Rumer Willis) to ex-husband Darryl (Robert Patrick), who is drunken and irresponsible. In order to raise money for a retrial, Erin works at a Miami strip club called The Eager Beaver. One patron at the club is Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds), who becomes addicted to Erin, and wants her to perform privately for him. Dilbeck's nearest advisors are worried of the dangers Dilbeck will get into because of this, but Erin has a plan to use Dilbeck to help get custody of her daughter back. However, when a dead body is found, someone who found dirt on Dilbeck, Erin finds herself in deep water. It came out a year after Showgirls, and there were comparisons, but NOTHING can compare to seeing Burt Reynolds in a leather cowboy suit greased up with Vaseline. :O There's nothing in this film you can take seriously, and that people actually went to see it is shocking. It would be a guiltly pleasure if it wasn't so dull.",

This film is awful. There's absolutely no other way to describe it. The performances suffer because the actors are terrible. The film is not engaging one bit, and it's just a big boring attempt at trying to make a good film. Obviously the film has gotten attention for Demi Moore, and it is really the only point of interest of this film. Not even that can save the film. This film is poorly acted, directed with a bad cast and a poor script. Striptease fails to entertain, and though we see Demi Moore's lovely assets, the film has nothing else going for it. A terrible, pointless film that should've never been made. Striptease aside from Demi Moore naked is not a good film; the film lacks a very good story, good story and everything else that makes a film good. I don't understand how this trash got made. A pointless and stupid film, Striptease is not good entertainment and is easily forgettable because the film is so mediocre. An awful film that should be avoided. This film also shows that Demi Moore isn't that good of an actress either. So aside from Moore naked, you're not missing much. If you want to watch it, proceed with caution.

She becomes an exotic dancer to finance the court appeal . Things start to get sticky when she gets involved with a hypocritical Senator (Reynolds), whom she thinks may be able to help get her daughter back. The plot is very convoluted with many little stories that coincidentally cross, peppered with underdeveloped supporting characters. It isn't funny enough to be a comedy, and it isn't serious enough to be a drama. Moore is no comedienne, and turns in the same performance as in every other one of her films. Her pumped up bod looks terrific, though her strip performances are intentionally \"artsy\" to hide her limited dance abilities. It is Reynolds and Rhames who walk away with the movie as the Senator and Moore's bouncer/bodyguard. Queer Quotient: The strips shows at the \"Eager Beaver\" where Moore works will certainly titillate some womyn. And for the serious drag queen, there is ample opportunity to inspect Moore's breast implants, if you're considering having work done.",

            "content": "There used to be this geeky British guy in TV which intruded himself among the celebrities and ridiculed them. At least he tried to. Once, when he confronted Demi Moore, he asked her \"If it was essential for the plot and done with a good taste, do you think you could keep your clothes on in a movie?\" In this movie you can see her with her clothes on and off, and I have to admit that he has a very, very nice set of boobies. Five star boobies. But I gave the flick three stars. I gave 'em because this movie is actually pretty good, but not perfect. Something is missing, but I can't really pinpoint what it is. The credit of the stars goes pretty much to Carl Hiaasen on whose novel this flick is based on, and to plot of which this movie is relatively loyal. In case you don't know who Hiaasen is, he's probably the best contemporary writer of humorous crime novels. I don't remember the vaseline scence in from the book, but that does not mean it's not there. And even if it's not, the makers of this movie have made a successful scene of Burt Reynolds' character as a republican congressman who wanders around covered with vaseline from head to toes when he's supposed to go and deliver a speech to young christians. Reynodls does a good performance. So does Rick Patric as white trash trailer park hustler. Ving Rhames is kewl as expected. And even Demi is not bad. I don't know how good an idea it is to compare movies to the books they are made of, particularly since it's been a long while gone when I read the very book. But, like I said, this movie is pretty loyal to Hiaasen's plot. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\". It might come out better form the book, in a more solid manner, and I recommend you to read the book, and other stuff by Hiiasen too if you like this flick. What the book can't deliver is Moore's boobs, so it might be a good idea to watch the movie and read the book. Or vice versa. I don't know. But you catch my drift, I'm sure...",
