You have to wait until the end  to find out that CANADA is the one the movie puts the attention on the most, and in a not-so surprising twist, the team that has the least amount jerks pulls through and \"beats the world\"...YAWWWWN\n\nYou get some parkour, some sessions, more parkour, 15 minutes of derivative plot, more sessions, it goes on and on and on. None of the relationships here are genuine, except for the main relationship between Yuson and his girl, but they both can't carry the film.\n\nUltimately, this is a \"me too\" film trying to capture the Step-Up craze, all the while screaming GOOO CANADA. In the end, we beat a German and Brazilian dance crew.....with inferior dance moves. What did you expect when the Beat The World tournament is held in bloody DETROIT?!? Shit, that's what.\n\nMindless, dull, derivative and utterly pointless, Beat The World only beats itself. With no imagination, interesting characters, or even creative dancing, it won't grab your attention. Stay clear of this dance wreck!",
