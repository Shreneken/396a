Every single cast member has given their best and it can be seen and felt clearly. The movie works both for masses and classes each one. The classes connect with the uniting of both countries together and masses connect with the heart touching story. Every single song is a masterpiece you won't feel like getting up a single time all are on the playlist vining. The beautiful locations used together are fabulous too. Overall a good movie by bhaijaan and kabir khan's direction to be credited! Must watch for everyone!",

            "content": "Normally we watch Salman Khan movies to forget what real life is like. For a poor person Salman Khan is not just a hero, he's basically a fantasy. They all want to have 6 pack abs, luxurious cars, a big mansion, use-and-throw girlfriends like Aishwarya and Katrina, a huge fanbase and infinite power in the industry. All of this is usually apparent in all Salman Khan movies, but not this one. Here we have a pious, obedient and saint version of Salman Khan in the form of Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi.\n\nThe story is actually pretty good, although has a couple of plot holes in the form of factually incorrect information (like Brahmins always being vegetarians, Pakistani police slapping a civilian for being a Hindu, the army letting someone cross the border just because they asked it, YouTube quickly spreading Pawan's story as if it's a normal thing etc). It's the acting that covers up the problems. However, the idea used in this story is very mediocre. It's not a kind of a movie you'd hear someone say that it's their favourite. Because it doesn't have anything new to offer. What it makes up with is the visual appeal and character driven story.\n\nI'm not a fan of Salman Khan. Rather I hate that person. But this movie is undoubtedly one of, if not the best Salman Khan movies ever made. And that's actually saying something since Andaz Apna Apna also exists. It absolutely deserves the box office collection it earned.",

Salman Khan and Harshali Malhotra's sweet chemistry is what further makes this fun entertainer work like hell. It's also one of these rare mainstream Hindi films which have all the flavours and deliver each element, sometimes to a fault, but the deal is kept genuine for the most part, and there's punch and fun to he had with this masala blockbuster which is wholesome.",

The story is simple enough but the movie feels strangely too long. There doesn't seem to be enough substance to warrant the long runtime of this Bollywood movie. The movie does feel repetitive in its middle and final act all up until the last twenty minutes or so. In the final moments, the movie makes its point loud and clear and I liked the positive message in the movie. It's a good movie with Salman Khan in the lead role, and anyone who knows me, that's something I don't say often or easily. If it shortened its runtime or made certain sections less repetitive, it may have been a better movie, but regardless it's a solid feel-good movie that I enjoyed watching.",

            "content": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan, a 2015 drama starring Salman Khan, is widely touted as the biggest hit of the year. The film won both critical acclaim and commercial success, a rare combination for a Salman Khan film. It won people's hearts for its emotional story and excellent performance by Salman Khan.\n\nI usually do not have any expectation from a Salman Khan film, but still the premise interested me - the story of a mute, little Pakistani girl stranded in India and how a magnanimous Indian, Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi (aka Bajrangi Bhaijan since he is a hanuman bhakt) helps her return to her motherland. A story of friendship and humanity between two warring countries, I thought it would strike a cord.\n\nAnd I was disappointed. Not so much because the movie is bad, but since it could have been a whole lot better. It has an exceptional story, emotionally powerful and heart wrenching. But unfortunately, it is let down by its direction. Right from the screenplay to the dialogues, the movie seems to lack the strength the story has. Every time I felt the movie was moving to the right track, bham! The director takes it away. The dialogues are poor, to say the least. It felt so clunky to the point of being unreal.\n\nThe music is one of the worst aspects of this film. Pritam disappoints this time around. And there are a lot of them, eleven in all, and after a while, it got unbearable. The one notable exception was the traditional rendition by Adnan Sami, \"Bhar do Jholi Meri\".\n\nWhat lifts the film is its performances. Salman Khan plays a role unlike he has ever played and does it with eloquence. You see Bhaijaan's innocence and his magnanimity without any of the \"over the top\" stuff that Salman Khan is synonymous with. The supporting cast is excellent too. From Nawazuddin Siddiqui to Om Purie, everyone does their job. Kareena Kapoor plays the romantic interest to Salman Khan, and does her job (which is not much) well. But the real star of the movie is Harshaali Malhotra, playing the mute little girl. She has no lines, but she brightens up every frame she is in. The movie is worth your time just for her performance. Her childishness, her naughtiness and her insecurities are portrayed excellently by Harshaali, whose portrayal of Munni is the best performance by a child actor this year. Brava!\n\nOverall, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is an average flick let down by its director, who, in his endevour to make a entertainer, completely destroyed the story. The only redemption is the performances, which, to an extent, mask the film's discrepancies. If you want to watch a good film about India-Pak friendship, watch Kya Dilli Kya Lahore, a small-budgeted, but triumphant work.\n\nSorry Mr Kabir Khan, but to mess up a movie this strong, it requires some \"skill\"!",

Music which should have played a key role does not cross the barbed fence unlike Salman Khan. Not withstanding the genuine laughs I got, my knapsack I still carry the burden 'Why are the countries ready for battle?'

It's worth noting that it has made $8M at the U.S box office despite the fact that it's showing in just 250 or so theaters.

The Eid release of Bajrangi Bhaijaan starring Salman Khan got my taste buds wetting with a huge appetite. But I could not help thinking about Salman Khan's recent dilemma with the laws of his land and the numerous court appearances he has made. How will Salman Khan dodge this release, will it be a hit or a miss?\n\nBajrangi Bhaijaan tells a story of a young muted girl called Shahida/Munni (Harshaali Malthotra) that has a tendency to wander off, but this time she parted for good from her mother who is sleeping on a train. The young girl crosses the border from India to Pakistan and latches onto Pawan (Salman Khan). Pawan seems to have a spiritual goodness about him that gives the young girl confidence to stay with him.\n\nSalman Khan's Logo 'Being Human' is what this film is about and I think Salman had got it to the 'T'. Salman's overall acting, gestures, dialogue was done with quality. Not too much of the old ingredients -  'Dashoom Dashoom' was minimal, the singing dancing was relevant to the film, The love interest  Rasika (Kareena Kapoor Khan) was just right and the story was emotional.\n\nSalman Khan's portrayal of the character may have been cleverly calculated as an honourable, trusted, devotee for the audience to sympathise with him, but he had nothing to worry about as his followers respect him regardless.\n\nI loved everything about this film, it had a genuine storyline, it was politically correct, it had great scenery, it had humour, it had emotions and it had a great soundtrack.\n'I'm a devotee of Lord Hanuman ...

            "content": "Celebrations among the Muslim community at this time of the year mark the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. While several may join in the festivities at Mohammed Ali road, the rest look forward to a big weekend for hindi cinema when almost every year, we are subjected to the abject mediocrity of several Salman Khan movies that make little sense but a whole lot of money. The trend continues in spite of his controversial hit and run case and what we have in Kabir Khan's ('New York', 'Kabul Express', 'Ek tha Tiger') 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a slight departure from the excessive over-the-top action by another angry young man. Surprisingly, Bhaijaan is perhaps the most sensible, poignant and overall entertaining film from the Salman Khan camp in recent years. However, the intellect of mankind be warned, it still remains in the league of implausible, overlong, at times ridiculous cinema that the masses adore. \n\nPawan Kumar Chaturvedi (Salman Khan) is a devout follower of Hanuman and with all his earnest mannerisms, is quite credible as the innocent, small town lad. However, with his academic failures and non-accomplishments, he is sent to Delhi to his father's friend Digambar (Sharat Saxena), who could possibly offer him a job. He of course, has a beautiful daughter Rasika (Kareena Kapoor) who develops a fondness for Pawan. Kabir Khan then reminds us of 'Maine pyar kiya', when the father of the girl demands that her suitor make something of himself and prove that he is worthy for her hand in marriage. It's Salman Khan, so challenge accepted. \nMeanwhile, during one of his celebrations, he is followed by a mute child, seemingly separated from her parents. She refuses to let go of his company, somehow trusting him for his personality. She's a child after all. Things get complicated when he has to bring her back home and provide shelter while he investigates her origins. After a lot of predictable scenes that reveal her religious background to the devout brahmins, Pawan is forced to take extreme measures to send her back. His decision to hand her over to a travel agent like a DHL parcel is not only questionable but simply ridiculous even for an imbecile that the director projects him to be. It only starts getting interesting when the hero decides to take things into his own hands and deliver Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra) to her family in Pakistan. \nThe series of events that unfold in a Muslim country such as Pakistan for a devout brahmin makes things funny and awkward but Salman Khan is good at such situations. This was his strength much before he took on the action roles. For the audience, a huge relief arrives in the form of the reporter Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), whose charming performance provides all the one-liners with exceptional timing and sincerity to Pawan's cause that adds gravity to the film's underlying story about a girl's separation from her parents. Nawab joins the duo in their attempt to avoid authorities and to find Shahida's lost paradise and in all the madness of the storyline, his respect for Pawan's sincerity and intentions is remarkably transposed in his performance. \nThis has to be one of the most mellow, non-Salman performances by Salman Khan even though, he has attempted such characters before. Watching him not repeating the same punchlines throughout the movie that would have audiences whistling, is quite a relief this time. His rise to being a hero in the climax is the bane of this film. The exaggerated version of Bajrangi Bhaijaan being recognized for his efforts is overlong and frankly, facepalm worthy. \nHarshaali Malhotra has been much appreciated for her cuteness and innocence in the film. Much like any other child artist. However, her talent needs further testing in a movie where she gets to speak but at some points, her expressions of disapproval, grief, mischief are on point. Om Puri in his cameo is delightful and so is Sharat Saxena in all his seriousness. Kareena Kapoor was just there but that blame goes to the director for not giving her a character to work with. \n\n\tV Vijayendra Prasad is on a roll currently with 'Baahubali' and Bajrangi Bhaijaan's successes that owed a fair amount to his story writing. However, he is quite unimpressive here with a very predictable, slow paced story that couldn't offer any engagement were it not for a couple of solid performances. Factors that certainly raise the film above mediocrity are the locations of Rajasthan, Sonmarg and Zoji-La in Kashmir. Spectacularly shot by cinematographer Aseem Mishra, these scenes will be etched in memory for a long time. The music is definitely a burden of the film with not one song being a memorable tune. Bhardo jholi by Adnan Sami is an exceptional qawalli that was originally sung by the Sabri brothers. While Adnan does a good job with his own version, it's quite a blatant infringement. Tu jo mila by KK is a melodious tune, reflecting upon the poignant relationship between Pawan and Shahida. The rest of the songs are quite forgettable.\n\n\tThe film's predictability, over-the-top climax and mediocre music maybe the shortfalls but performances by Salman, Nawazuddin and Harshaali are outstanding in their own right. Kabir Khan left the best parts in the second half when the 3 of them team up in Pakistan, searching for Shahida's home. Their journey is long and tedious but entertaining nevertheless. The first half was too great a burden on the film. Yet, it is Kabir Khan's best film so far, not that he has such an impressive list and it certainly is Nawazuddin's best role in a big budget film. Salman Khan proves that he can get away from stereotypical characters and almost make us believe in his earnest, religious Bajrangi Bhaijaan. \n\n7.381 on a scale of 1-10.",

            "content": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan is predictable. For someone who has seen the trailer one could easily guess the entire story. In the beginning of the film itself you know that our protagonist will successfully help the girl find her home and that by some miracle she would start speaking. Having said that, it is one of those very rare films whose promos left me disinterested but the movie struck as a wonderful surprise. Arguably, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is one of the best and most sincere performance by Salman after a long time. The film pans out as an emotional drama involving relationships, nationalism, communalism, honesty, innocence and the will to do something good. Ofcourse being a Bollywood affair it is jarred with unnecessary songs and several cliches, but what keeps it all together is the good intent and a warm heart at the core of its story. Salman has done films in the recent past with all jazz but no soul and this is where Bajrangi scores way above. He plays the role of an honest, god fearing man with supreme elan, a side of Salman which we have forgotten thanks to the trash he doled out in the past. Nawazuddin brings humor and even more zest to the film's second half which is much more exciting. Kareena is wasted though. The unexpected surprise however is the little girl whose very smile and doe eyes would make anyone melt and she and Salman share an awesome chemistry on screen. Kabir Khan shoots in sweeping landscapes, of desert, Kashmir and suburban Delhi. Though at first glance it may seem like an ordinary film but Bajrangi has many layers to it which I was happy to see. Consider the dialogue where a person asks Salman, \"What is a Selfie?\" And he replies: \"Are wahi jisme \"Apni Lete hain\"..Tasveer\" or the instance where Om Puri says regarding Kashmir-\"Thoda usme humara bhi hai\". There are many such instances in the film and though it ends in a lumpy throated, teary eyed climax which is slightly unbelievable but then if Forrest Gump can find himself running then we know that at times of extreme emotion we tend to shine bright. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a very good film in that way, though it is plagued by the usual problems which Bollywood films struggle with, it has its heart and sentiment in the right place. If not for anything else, it will make you believe that honesty and good heartedness are not lost virtues.",

The film has a big heart and a bigger cast of actors that all do their part to sell the story of a lost mute six year old girl from Pakistan who gets left behind and lost from a train stop in bordering India.  To say that the Pakis and Indians dislike and distrust each other is an understatement.  But Pavan will not be shirk his duty to do the right thing, even if it requires sneaking into Pakistan with no clue where to go to find the mute girl's parents in a mountain village.

You will not get to see Salman destroying 50 henchmen all alone neither you find any catchy mass apealing dialogues. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is an emotional journey where we can see that a 6 year old girl Shahida (Munni) who is mute, came with her mother to India from Pakistan somehow accidentally missed the train while returning and left out behind. Now in India she met Pawan Kr. Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi who is very innocent and good at heart and from here we will see that how Bajrangi takes Munni back to her home which is in Pakistan. Basically the first half has no impact, the real story starts from the second part. Harshaali Malhotra has played her role beautifully and I consider her as the life of this film, though played a mute girl character her expressions were amazing and will surely bring tears to your eyes. Salman Khan has acted well in this movie. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as usual a fine actor did his role very well. But if I go according to the story there are many mistakes. This movie depends upon a lot on emotional notes specially the climax. One thing I can surely say that this is a different kind of movie from the rest of Salman movies. Maybe one of the finest Salman Khan's movie in a long time. I would rate this movie a 3.5 out of 5.",

            "content": "Die hard fans of Salman Khan are probably the most loyal set of people out there, they stand by him in his thick or thin. I have to admit, I am not a Salman Fan, well frankly keeping all prejudice about his personal life aside, I loath the kind of cinema he represents, a section which condemns creativity. Despite that I haven't missed any of his Eid releases, be it the terrible Bodyguard or the watchable Kabir Khan directed Ek Tha Tiger. Salman Khan as an actor has limitations, we all know that. Have those precincts ever made any difference? No. Salman is not a method actor. He will never be Naseer or Aamir. I watch Salman Khan films to see whether he is better than his other films or not. Despite all the major success his films have been, I would personally not recommend them to anyone. But this film is not the typical 'Salman Khan' film where he breaks into a song out of now where & beats up goons to the pulp. This is the kind of the film which pulls the strings of your heart, a film you would stand up & applaud. This is not an Anti-Pakistan film, as some people are making it out to be. The filmmakers have tried being reasonable as much as they could without ruining the plot requirements. They have shown the good and bad on both sides. The film also touched upon religious divide and there it has shown them more accommodating of the two religions. What it does communicate strongly is the secular message of modern India while promoting good ties with Pakistan. The movie has blend of so many wonderful emotions, dialogues, screenplay which makes the whole plot just works. The story follows a mute 6 year old Pakistani girl Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra), who accidentally jumps off a train on route to Pakistan from Delhi, therefore leaving her lost in India. She then finds a man named Pawan Kumar (Salman Khan), who is a noble hearted Bajrangi devotee. At first with the help of his fiancee Rasikaa (Kareena Kapoor Khan), a teacher in Delhi, he tries to locate her home. But on finding out that her roots lie in Pakistan, he crosses the border & finds reporter Chaand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Does the girl get back to her family, and if so how is what forms the crux of the film. While the first-hour, set in India warms up, with defining its characters & shifting between songs, its the second-hour that takes the film to the epitome. The story shifts to Pakistan & the series of events that follow with its endearing protagonist & the child, are undeniably engaging & moving. And the climax, though slightly melodramatic, that too leaves an impact. Both the Censor Board of India and Pakistan has called this movie the most positive film ever made in Bollywood hinting the emotional message lied in the script. For instance, Fakhr e Aalam - head of Censor Board of Pakistan took it to his Tweeter saying that it is not a negative film and the most positive film ever made on an Indo-Pak topic. The film stuns you with its positive message of peace between Indo- Pak, but the film isn't preachy or in your face at all. It actual tugs at your heart strings. This is a film in the Raj Kumar Hirani mould, a film with a heart, a message, a great script and a film that you wont forget once you leave the cinema halls. And to answer another question, no this is not a regular masala potboiler from SK,its way beyond that, its a game changer, its probably 2015's best film to date. Somewhere in the film, a flaw or two with the plot does chafe the credibility from the setup, but it is all taken care with the introduction of a new character (Siddiqui) who is charmingly funny and really adds to the fun factor to the rest of the film. A tiny romance sub-story which reminds you of Khan's Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya (1991), Khan's religious innuendos which reminds you of a recent another Khan film (2014), and most of the songs shot with ugly choreography are some elements that may force the viewer to turn his/her head. In the first half, a good twenty minutes were spent on establishing the love story between Salman and Kareena. As the film lasted 163 minutes, cutting fifteen of those minutes and a song could have made the edit sharper and more gripping. The role could have been played by any actress. Salman could have been a married or single man in the film. It would not have had any impact on the final outcome. Yet, director Kabir Khan has attempted something which appeals mainly to the masses as well urban areas.  He knew when to take creative liberty in best interest of the film (Armies of both countries being lenient on borders etc.) and knew when to make things look realistic (tunnels at the border, Samjhota express, Shahid Afridi etc). Salman Khan has put in a genuine effort to emote and get into the skin of the role. The actor has put in one of his best performances. His demeanor as a simple villager is to the point, his performance towards the latter half of the film is strong. He has a very powerful scene in the first half at a brothel, where he struggled to convince on the emotions, but still did a better job than his recent films. Funnily, despite all the limitations Salman Khan has, I was unable to picture any other actor playing Bajrangi. This film did not need an actor, but needed Salman Khan the star to deliver and he has delivered! Kareena Kapoor is likable in a small but convincing role. Nawazuddin Siddiui is just brilliant His intro sequence is a straight lift from Pakistan's very own Chaand Nawab is hilarious. Nawaz comes on screen only in the second half of BB and took the burden of carrying the film on his gifted shoulders. His chemistry with Salman is something seen very rarely between male leads of a film. Immaculate comic timing, perfect body language and expressive eyes, its just awesome! The real star of this film is Harshaali Malhotra, the child actor is probably the cutest kid to hit the silver screens. Despite her challenging role with no dialogues, she manages to completely overshadow Salman Khan! Super cute, super charming and super convincing! She is a tremendous actress and is beyond excellence for a child actor. On, the whole, 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' endorses the religion of Humanity, Love and Togetherness!!! It is an entertainer and inspires us to accept the diversity, culture and habits across the border and love them. Bajrangi Bhaijaan will definitely win your hearts. Must Watch!",

She is not the usual kind of heroine you see in films. \n\nNawaz - He steals the show right from the first scene and in the second half he stands out and takes the film to an other level.\n\nOm Puri - He is a man with golden heart, though being a Muslim (in the film), he treats every religion with respect. You just wanna hug him when he says ' Jai Shree Ram.'\n\nHarhsaali - This little cute  girl is the soul and purpose of the film. Angelic face and right kind of expression that she gives makes you fall in love with this girl.\n\nThe scenes between Salman and Harshaali are the highlights.\n\nI have seem few people hating this film and making comments about Salman khan saying that he is a killer and blah blah.Its very foolish to judge a film based on a person's personal life. It has go nothing to do with a good film. Salman no matter what kind of person he is, has backed up a good film and has performed well, so we should appreciate him as an actor instead of commenting about his personal life.\n\n.Those are the people who usually likes non sense, masala no brainers. SORRY guys, this film is not for fools like you.\n\nThis film establishes the relationship between India and Pakistan in a very beautiful way. There are many scenes in the film where people have given standing ovation and clapped.\n\nI would give 5/5 just because this film blew my mind as I went with zero expectations and it changed my perception towards life.\n\nThank you BAJIRANGI BHAIJAAN. This film just wants you to be a better person. Feeling blessed.",

This would incite many Bhaitards to move towards my Residence ready to wreck mayhem at my blasphemy, but then I am a Hanuman Bhakt like his character in the film, who shall not lie at any cost. The best dialogues belong to Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who has formed a great chemistry with the Bhai post Kick and is clearly in hyperdrive here too.\n\nSo Harshaali is the scene-stealer and Nawazuddin has the best dialogues, so where does that leave Salman in the film. He does what he used to so very well in the late 80's and early 90's and reminds all of us how much we missed that avatar. The story by the father of the Director of Baahubali, takes cinematic liberties especially in the protracted climax but as it has its heart in the right place, it doesn't have to try too hard to make us forgive for these transgressions. I have served in the Valley during my Army days and trust me any film which is shot there has a strong chance to click with me but then Kashmir has that charm which we mere mortals cant escape from and gleefully submit to the ethereal beauty not surpassed even by the Swiss Alps. Kareena Kapoor has small role which he plays with her usual exuberance but the chemistry you carry from the theatre alongwith a wet handerkerchief is between Salman and Harshaali, which must have surely prompted Salim Khan after the Trials shows to take Salman head on regarding his future plans to take this connect from reel to real.\n\nWhen your story has 'dum', your lead hero is ready to invest more than his time into, Kashmir is your backdrop, scaringly slimmed down Adnan Sami belting a Dargah song and Nawazuddin & Harshaali giving inspired performances, there is no chance in a million this could have gone wrong and it didn't.\n\nI would also like to commend the Director Kabir Khan to pull Salman away to be a part of this journey where Salman though does beats up the goons but what we remember fondly even after the theatre lights switch off again for the next show, is his childish and uncorrupted innocence which we thought was lost forever in a performance he and his fans shall toast over in the times to come.\n\nHarshaali be prepared to be home schooled and hope your parents get a good Manager to handle the scripts as we surely are bound to see a lot of you in the future and oh yes, at the risk of Bhaitards rage, Welcome Back Salman.",

Spectacular story and amazing music as well, but this is completely carried by Salman the whole way.",

In the Hindi film industry such films as Munna Bhai, 3 Idiots, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,ZNMD are such films that define this decade as outstanding pathbreaking cinema that will be remembered forever. Now its time to add Bajrangi Bhaijaan to that list.\n\nYes the film is that amazing. Its Kabir Khan's best and one of Salman Khan's best films ever. The film stuns you with its positive message of peace between Indo- Pak, but the film isn't preachy or in your face at all. It actual tugs at your heart strings. BB is a film in the Raj Kumar Hirani Mould, a film with a heart, a message, a great script and a film that you wont forget once you leave the cinema halls.And to answer another question, no this is not a regular masala potboiler from SK,its way beyond that, its a game changer, its 2015's best film to date.\n\nThe films story is a simplistic tale of a mute 6 year old girl who accidentally jumped of a train that had her mother on board which was going back to Pakistan, therefore leaving her lost in India .She then finds a man named Pawan, who is a noble hearted Bajrangi devotee. He after many difficulties swears to take this girl back to Pak. Does the girl get back to Pak to her family,and if so how is what forms the crux of the film.\n\nActing wise Salman Khan is a revelation, after many years SK has stepped out of the Mass acting mould and played a different role which required expert acting. His simplicity and honesty in the character of Pawan wins you over. He rules the film start to finish, and don't be surprised if sweeps the award shows this season he deserves all the awards and accolades for his role. The little girl in the film Harshali Malhotra is the most cutest,adorable girl i have ever seen in any film, she is the heart of film. Nawaz again steals the show, he has an amazing comic act. Kareena Kapoor is beautiful, and first rate in her limited role.\n\nOverall this SK film is pathbreaking, its film where the story and script came first. A story of patriotism,of true emotions, of love, and ...Peace.This is a must watch for all Indians and Pakistans, because a film like this can end, a border war almost lasting 100 years. Yes BB is that powerful but simple that every Indo- Pak can understand the message.Kabir Khan who must have been inspired by Raju Hirani's style of movie making, deserves a standing ovation, get ready for the award shows sir because you will be seeing many trophies soon.Finally the films climax is such that if you dont cry, then you must not be human.\n\n5/5* or 10/10",
