    "summary": "After serving time together in prison, three gangsters from different backgrounds -- Carlito (Jay Hernandez), Earl (Mario Van Peebles) and Rocco (Michael Kelly) -- join forces and take over the lucrative heroin trade in Harlem, N.Y. However, their partnership with a gangster (Burt Young) is threatened when Earl's hotheaded little brother, Reggie (Mtume Gant), disrespects the mobster's son and then kidnaps him. A ransom goes out on Reggie's head, and the friends are forced to choose sides.",

Soundtrack is full of obscure songs of the day and age; the O'Jays in particular, getting the royal treatment in a basement bar.",

            "content": "If it wasn't for the Carlito's Way collection set I would have never known about the existence of the prequel. Now a prequel in this case makes some sense exploring more Carlito Brigante life and diving deeper into how he became to be the man he went on to be is by no means a bad thing. Unfortunately this prequel does very little in terms of developing Carlito Brigante further than what was already established in the original Carlito's Way.\r\n\r\nCarlito's Way: Rise To Power is set in the late 1960s, follows Carlito Brigante emerging as the heroin czar of Harlem. Much like the original its heavily driven by dialogue, but the narrative path taken is strictly linear. Following the routine of a standard crime film the script does not bring anything you haven't seen before to the table; you have a young criminal rising to power, the wise and well spoken mentor, to the old and angry Italian wiseguy who doesn't like young punks, romance with a street wise woman, and many more crime film tropes. Going as far as showing the outcome of the climax like it predecessor in the beginning of the film. Unoriginality only begins to scratch the surface of problems. Characters are entirely new without a single one created in attempt to bridging the two films. These new characters are written with good intentions, but the interactions between them is predictable. One new character upon being immediately introduce is utterly unlikable only to become a driving force for the film narrative. At no point is this character downfall ever tragic because by design making the film most unlikable character have emotional weight does not work. This same notion works with the rest of the film. You have a standard setup or plot device with a predictable outcome appearing superficial only to become a major part of the story serving it weakness. Story elements are often half baked, generic in execution, and empty of any risks. The film's ending is easily the biggest drawback of the story. With this being a prequel it fails to show exactly how Carlito Brigante went to jail for a force happy ending. At no point does this prequel help pave the way for events of the original \"Carlito's Way\". By the time the climax comes you will truly feel just how unspectacular everything turned out to be.\r\n\r\nJay Hernandez who played Carlito does a decent job, but if you are looking for the intensity of Al Pacino, it won't be there. Hernandez's smoothly understated performance and the colorful presence of Mr. Van Peebles performances are better than the film itself. Sean Combs give sa moderate performance looking directly at the camera and delivery over the top lines to the best of his abilities. Luis Guzman (also in the original Carlito's Way) was entertaining as the nutty hit-man. His casting in this film is a huge problem not only does he play a completely different character, but it adds confusion seeing an actor from the original breaking continuity and comes off as goofy that Carlito would meet two people who look and act exactly the same. Mtume Gant comes off as annoying, but that's mostly to blame on the material. If anything Mtume Gant is quite good making his character as unlikable as possible. It's a shame the material didn't offer him any scene to show of his character good sides. Aside from poor writing is director Michael Bregman is too blame for this lifeless prequel. Wait why does that name sound familiar...he was a producer on \"Carlito's Way\". In that that case his directorial effort is awful. Every scene is just plainly shown without a personality or any kind style behind the camera. Michael Bregman simply films a scene and that's it. No emotion, no eye for details, nothing that conveys the interest from Bregman. Everything is comes across more lifeless than the characters killed in this movie. Bregman might have worked on the original, but chose not to retain anything that worked in Brain De Palma film.\r\n\r\nCarlito's Way: Rise To Power fails as a standalone film for staying closely to the genre routine without an attempt to be different and as a prequel fail to connect the dot to its predecessor in any way. It fails in these two areas even more so taking into account that with a failure to expand upon a beloved film in any area. It's just about as superficial as a prequel can get.",

This film had minimal connection to it's predecessor save for the lead character himself. Bregman is no Brian De Palma, the dramatic level didn't come close to Carlito's Way. The writing style was completely different, it's tough to even consider this in the same series as it's forerunner. Although it wasn't much more than a piggyback on a successful gansgter movie, it wasn't complete crap. I just love movies that show the rise of a criminal group, although I have to say there wasn't too much explanation regarding how Carlito actually came to power. It seemed like the gang was instantaneously in the big leagues after a few scenes following Carlito's release from prison. Although the technical aspects weren't highlighted, the plot was still pretty cool. Featuring a pleasant love arc as well as the gang rivalries and other crime drama. Jay Hernandez & Michael Kelly put on the best performances here, unfortunately some of the other performers didn't do so great. Those jokes who played Manny and his buddy were so bad it was almost comical. Aside from some weak performances, the plot was actually pretty good. Not exactly a groundbreaking story but it was thoroughly entertaining. I think that this movie took a bad rap just for trying to attach itself to Carlito's Way, but on it's own it's actually a solid gangster flick.",

            "content": "This direct to video 2005 film by Michael Bregman, is meant as a prequel to the superior Carlito's Way from 1993 directed by Brian de Palma.\r\n\r\nPlot: In the 60's, Carlito Brigante(Jay Hernandez) is doing time, and is soon to be released from a New York prison. His 2 cell mates, African American Earl(Mario Van Peebles) and Italian Rocco(Michael Kelly), give Carlito an offer he can't refuse. \r\nSpanish Harlem needs a heroin distributor that has no objections staying off the Black Harlem territory. Perfect for Carlito being Puerto Rican, he takes over distribution and rises as a drug lord.\r\nBlack Harlem is reigned by Hollywood Nicky(P.Daddy), and Carlito is warned to keep out if the territory to avoid a bloody war.\r\nCarlito's side kick Earl, wants to retire before it's too late and move to the Bahamas.\r\n\r\nI don't think I need explaining more of the plot, and you have heard and seen it all before. Nothing new here for the educated film viewer, though \"Gangsta Wannabees\" might find this good.\r\n\r\nI have lots of problems with this film:\r\n\r\n1.Jay Hernandez is totally miscast as Carlito Brigante. \r\nEven though this is about Carlito's rise to power (in the Brian dE Palma film, Carlito is a living legend), we should still be able to see the character develop into a feared drug lord.\r\nJay's is not convincing as Carlito, looks like a cute kid from a boy band, and is simply not a very good actor. \r\n\r\n2.Mario Van Peebles seems to get involved in too many mediocre B films that don't deliver a punch what so ever. Mario is the son of blaxploitation cinema pioneer Melvin Van Peebles of \"Sweet Sweetback's Bad Ass song\" fame. It seems as Mario was casted simply to attract viewers, as the son of the respected director of African American cinema. Too bad, as Mario is not a bad actor either, and has been in better productions. Maybe he was short on his rent ...\r\n\r\n3.Visually the film suffers from obvious interior film studio sets and has a cheap video look. Bad hair pieces and moustaches piss me off.\r\n\r\n4.The script tries to be as cool as the controversial \"Superfly\", and even the soundtrack imitates the great Curtis Mayfield score.\r\n\r\n5.Jay Hernandez narrates part of the film as Carlito, and is an embarrassing attempt trying to imitate Al Pacino.\r\n\r\n6.Rushed happy ending.\r\n\r\n7.Director Michael Bregman produced the original \"Carlito's Way\", and the awful \"Adventures of Pluto Nash\" starring Eddie Murphy. Production experience DOES NOT put you into the directing chair.\r\n\r\nI can go on and on, but let me try to think of some positive things to say about this whole mess of a production.\r\n\r\nI will give the film credit for the part of Luis Guzman as hit-man Nacho Reyes. Luis is great as the coke snorting hit-man that has a contract on Carlito's life. He enjoys his work as both hit-man, torturer and has nice briefcase full of handy confessional devices.\r\n\r\nI did not expect greatness from this and can see why it went straight to video dungeon obscurity. Again, this is one I caught on late night cable and probably would have never seen it if not. \r\n\r\nStill, it out a smile on my face a couple of times. I have seen worse believe me, but then again I'm talking about B films that don't take themselves serious, as this one does. \r\n\r\nSo save your money and wait for it on TV, or borrow the DVD if you know anybody that collects stuff like this .",

Carlito's Way is one of the great film's of the nineties. This movie seems to ignore it.

This can be a blessing in disguise there isn't any lame \"Hey I'm Juan Blanco from the Bronx, this my kid brother Benny\" or \"you better not drink & drive Lalin, you'll end up in a wheelchair\" type allusions. The story is okay the twist & turns of the plot are good in a sort of clunky thriller way & the dialogue doesn't have any cheesy clangers that spring to mind. The juxtaposition  of supposed of ice cold killers like Hollywood Nicky (thats the one Diddy plays) & whoever Luiz Guzman played & their wacky interactions with other characters (ru ro!! you'd better not eat food in Diddy..I mean Nicky's pimpmobile) doesn't work at all. If this movie were called Juan Ramirez Rise to Power I wouldn't have given it a second glance. Frankly it might as well be the amount it has to do with the DePalma Pacino movie.

The books that this moive and DePalmas film is based upon are Edwin Torres was called Carlitos Way and After Hours.",
