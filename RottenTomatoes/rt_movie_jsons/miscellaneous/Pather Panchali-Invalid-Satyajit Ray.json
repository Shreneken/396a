One of those strong debuts in the storytelling approach expressed by solid merits under cultural significance, but it unknowingly disconnects between the pacing and unflinching harshness with decreasing hopeful sense. However, it deserves to be given a fair rating over its productive merits and efforts emotionally connected to their home cultural like a cinematic representation. (B+)",

            "content": "Idk what it is, but there's something magical about India and all its rich culture. Anytime I start watching an Indian movie where the opening credits has sitar music, I always get excited. The restoration that Criterion did looks incredible. Even though shot in black & white, it still looks gorgeous. I see that Satyajit loves his panning and tracking shots. And rightfully so, I can tell he has the patience, discipline and attention to detail to pull them off beautifully. The locations that Satyajit was able to find are so beautiful. They're rich with organic textures, and the way he uses lighting accentuates whatever's on screen. \n\nAww, poor little kitty. She didn't have to throw it like that lol. I know those were different times in a different country, but that was a bit much. It's a little kitten after all. Wow, is that school? School seems kinda weird. It seems like the teacher is the same person who sells spices and oils to the locals. Old auntie is quite the character. She could definitely be inspiration for a character out of a Disney movie. Wow, Auntie legitimately looked dead when her time came. That actress that played Auntie did a terrific job. \n\nWow, Indian women have beautiful hair! Long black and wavy. Those shots of the pond with all the little insects dancing on the surface of the water were beautiful. Satyajit really has an eye for cinematography and composition. Holy crap, I can't believe how that storm destroyed the entire outside of their home; it's wrecked. That's pretty dark, I wasn't expecting Apu's sister to pass away. That was very unexpected and sad, especially seeing the parents reaction to her passing away. I guess Apu had no choice but to grow up quickly after that. I can also understand the death of Apu's sister. She was kind of a kleptomaniac always stealing something whether from the neighbors or shops. I think stealing the little girls beads was probably the last straw and was punished for that. And on top of that she lied about not stealing it. Apu unexpectedly found it hidden in a bowl and did one last favor for his recently deceased sister by throwing the necklace into the lake so no one would ever find out. Forever a secret shared between Apu and his sister. That was really sweet of Apu to do that. \n\nSatyajit tells the story in a very sweet and tender way that feels very cozy. But also acknowledges the hardships of living in an impoverished environment and the struggles that come with that. I love the way he tackles family matters in a very realistic way. The story of Apu's family and his beginnings is one that is simple but is told beautifully. Simply put, this is just a gorgeous and magical movie. It's a sort of meditative cinematic experience that never becomes boring nor loses its momentum. I absolutely love this movie! I can even say that I cherish it. I can't wait to watch the other two Apu films!",

            "content": "Pather Panchali is a 1955 film directed by the legendary director Satyajit Ray. It is Mr.Ray's first film and it is one of the most finest works of Mr.Ray.\n\nThe film is certainly a masterpiece. The film is overwhelmingly real and the key element in the movie is the maintenance of this realism. The characters are so true to the ethnic rural-sixties Indian existence that one is compelled to wonder if the film was captured through surveillance cameras.\nIt's a quiet, simple tale, centering on the life of a small family living in a rural village in Bengal. The father, Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee), is a priest and poet who cares more about his writing and spiritual welfare than obtaining wages he is owed. The mother, Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee), worries that her husband's financial laxity will leave her without enough food for her two children, daughter Durga (Uma Das Gupta) and son Apu (Subir Bannerjee). Harihar's family often lives on the edge of poverty, coping with the unkind taunts of their neighbors, the burden of caring for an aging aunt (Chunibala Devi), and the terrible aftermath of a natural catastrophe.\n\nMost of what transpires is shown through the eyes of either Sarbojaya or Durga, and, as a result, we identify most closely with these two. Harihar is absent for more than half of the movie, and, before the penultimate scene, Apu is a mere witness to events, rather than a participant. Until the closing moments, we don't get a sense of the young boy as a fully formed individual, since he's always in someone else's shadow.\n\nThe simple story of the Bengali family will definitely stay in my heart for a long time to come.",

There are no action scenes, nothing special at all, still one of the most iconic movies of all time. And the short, Apu running towards a train  was arguably one of the best scenes in film history. A simple drama of life, with tons of Apu's emotions of his village and his sister, are incredible. The story mainly shows a child and his innocence, his free life. The plot is quite simple, but the movie is still good enough to have a special place in hearts. In a sentence, Christopher Nolan's words may be used : 'One of the best movies ever made, an incredible piece of work.'",

            "content": "Watching movies about people suffering in impoverished areas of the world is not exactly a pleasant experience. It can be informative, because we learn a bit about how their day-to-day lives look, but it\u2019s not what I would call enjoyable. Pather Panchali takes us through a handful of years in the life of an Indian family that is struggling to provide food and shelter for their children. It is a big slice-of-life drama that doesn\u2019t exactly follow a narrative, but hits on some of the highlights (or should I say lowlights) of their menial existence. Watching the film reminded me of when missionaries visit my church and show a video. While seeing their simple lives in these remote parts of the world, it does give me a strong appreciation for all I have, and it also makes me extremely grateful that I don\u2019t have to spend time in places like that. However, Pather Panchali takes me right there and keeps me in that place for more than two hours. Pather Panchali is clearly an accurate reflection of life for people in these desperate parts of the world, but that makes it somewhat unpleasant for me to watch for long. I don\u2019t find any pleasure in seeing people suffer, and the more the movie made the characters likeable, the more I hated to watch them struggle. The other thing that didn\u2019t work for me in Pather Panchali are the slow silent moments. There are times when the film halts any dialogue, and not much at all happens as we stare at a person walking or a breeze blowing through the trees. I hate to say it, but for a film that feels so personal and authentic, I was bored a lot. Then when things started happening again it was more disappointment or agony for our main characters. I can see how others might embrace Pather Panchali because there is nothing inherently bad in the way the film is made, and it feels like it could be documentary footage, but it was fairly tough for me to watch.",

But when maturity screened the film again for me, I was left with tears in my eyes. Emotional, sentiment and atmospheric, 'Pather Panchali' is an important character in my love story with Indian cinema. Satyajit Ray's genius is alone commendable. These characters- Apu and Durga- are always the children inside me. They have fun and they are fun, but they are always emotionally mature and come with in-depth thoughtfulness. The setting of rural Bengal breathes with soulful rhythm. The melody of the sound of the train amidst the 'kash phool' in the beautiful, arresting festival of Durga Puja fills you with wide-eyed wonder. The climax is sure to tear you apart with its moving subtlety. The film is to be seen as full-bodied original and not a part of the Apu trilogy, and only then can you take the essence of the film as your own. This film is a great pillar of Indian cinema and a pioneer of writing the script. Or did Ray conjure it? well, I would believe in the latter. The film is a magic. It has a beat, a beat no film could ever produce. A hue no film can ever match. And that's why it is the best of Indian cinema ever. ",

            "content": "Clearly influenced by Italian neorealism, this is the simple story of a small family living in poverty in rural Bengal.  The backstory behind the film is quite impressive; it was director Satyajit Ray's first, and done with an incredibly low budget, inexperienced crew, and amateur actors.  The result is often stunning.  There are some truly beautiful scenes in the natural surroundings where the family live, and the cinematography is wonderful.  The family members are striking as well, starting with the grandmother (Chunibala Devi), who with her withered face and stooped back, has quite an appearance.  Devi portrays the character with inner fire and depth, and it was sad to read she passed away at 80 before the film was released.  The little boy, Apu (Subir Banerjee) also looks out on the world he is growing up in with such beautiful eyes.\n\nDespite the film being the first in the 'Apu Trilogy', the film really centers on the mother (Karuna Banerjee), who is the bedrock of the family.  She keeps it together while the husband (Kanu Banerjee) pursues idealistic dreams, often not taking their economic condition seriously enough.  She deals with her neighbors, who criticize her daughter (Runki Banerjee and Uma Dasgupta) for stealing fruit, and also her parenting.  She accepts her own broken dreams (\"I had lots of dreams too.  All the things I wanted to do...\"), and handles the sadness which comes their way.  \n\nWhile I appreciated the film's beauty, and the fact that it transported me into this impoverished little world, it was a little too quiet for my taste.  There are some moving events and it finishes strong, but too much of it was mundane along the way.  Perhaps Ray simply captures this little world perfectly, without pretense and completely realistically, which artistically is saying something, and what resonates so strongly with most critics.  If that's what you're looking for, this is your film.  As an alternative, I personally liked a couple of his later films better (Charulata (1964), and The Coward (1965)), which you might consider.",

            "content": "Sometimes, if you have to get to the heart of a legend, your scalpel will face a tougher time clearing the thickets of pre-existent praise surrounding it, than in the actual dissection of the subject at hand. A watching of Citizen Kane ,especially for a cineaste who is not yet deadened by the laureals heaped on it, may well require years of staying away from any comments on the movie, and active exorcising of any external opinions about it, before one settles down to the chimerical task of reviewing it without bias. Only a little less rigour is granted when one approaches the chance to analyze the joys and verities of Pather Panchali- the putatively canonical film that brought international acclaim to Satyajit Ray. Even without actively persuing his oeuvre, I have ended up watching close to a dozen works of this Bengali pezzonovante and consequently have no qualms in positing that Ray ranks as the pre-eminent auteur of early Indian cinema. So when the man who unknowingly initiated me into film analysis with his coruscating reviews, attests that Pather Panchali \"kills\" him every time time he watches it, that \"no other film compares...at least in my eyes\", I was re-stoked. But empathy did not instantly spring forth- I was a bigger admirer of the canvas and emotional span of this film's successor- Aparajito, and remember more vividly the intensely introspective, dare I use the world \"existential\", agony that suffuses Apur Sansar- the end of this trilogy and a film that prefigures other remarkable works like Wenders' \"Paris, Texas\". But a return to the heartland is never off the cards for a true native, hence I closed the curtains, ensured a suitably wide screen, and immersed myself into what is amongst the Government of Bengal's most valuable investments from the 1950s.\n\nStatutory warning : This is not a compact review, it is a full-length reflection.\n \nThroughout the course of this review, I'm going to throw around more theories than I usually do. After all, what is the fun in being a critic if you don't conjure up certain points that the director would never have dreamed of?\n \nThe canvas of Pather Panchali is primordial, an Eden that has ended even before it has begun.No government,council or panchayath is shown in the movie, the authority squarely falls upon the personal self and in this manner Ray succeeds in making this a private universe marooned in the sprawling outdoors.Cutting himself free from the clutter of Calcutta, or even a well-populated part of the provinces, he retreats into the hinterland and emerges with a fable that defies a moral.\n \nThe film commences with English credits, and then opens with a parchment on which Bengali alphabet is inked with sharp yet flowing flamboyance -a harbinger of the primary yet inspired storyline that lies in wait. World cinema viewers will note the similarity to early Japanese films in which opening credits show stylish alphabets inscribed on a stark screen. World-famous Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar kicks off the soundtrack in this intro sequence with a bracing tabla, then launches into jaunty sitar, and wraps up the sequence with a somber flute.\n \nWhen I was trawling the web a year ago for the esteemed editorial page review that Shyam Lal lavished on Pather Panchali back in the days when Times of India was still a reputable newspaper, I never came across the full body of the article, but some choice gobbets from it had found their way into cyberpsace. Lal observed that there \"is not a trace of the theatre in it\" - a very germane consideration in the 1950s considering that Indian cinema was still finding its footing then and seeking to distinguish itself from the mores of theatre plays. Ray was also aware of the need for this distinction not only in 1955 but also years later in '66 when the only film of his that is named after me- an underwhelming movie,sadly -features its hero in a scene quietly complaining that a senior thespian is clueless about the need to not shout out his dialogues on the set's sound stage. In addition to featuring cinema verite acting, Pather Panchali steps far away from any artificial trappings of the theatre and sets itself in the heart of sylvan monochromes -once can feel the humid tropical stillness of the Indian heartland. Employing clear canvases, Ray is able to capture this Indian mofussil intimacy even when he changes into colour and brings his camera indoors into the bedroom of a wife in Ghare Bhaire. But in Song of the Little Road, the frames demand much more room- -the very first shot of the film shows a woman praying in front a tulsi plant, instead of an indoor idol. Successive shots show a bamboo grove filling the entire screen impressively while young Durga - a Mowgli without luck- filches a guava. She then hop-skips down a clearing and heads home.\n \nHer parents live in poverty that is intensifying by the day.Hari's reports of landing a job in the very next month as an accountant and paid priest,and his plan to sell his original poems and plays to travelling artists, is all narrated to his wife Sarbojaya with such assurance that her face- despite all the years of failure and poverty-  relaxes into a smile .She verbalizes her dreams of two good meals per day, of new clothes twice per year,and Hari adds to her visions by promising house repair and debt repayment within two years. Focus shifts to their children - referring to her infant son, Sarbojaya tells her husband \"You'll teach the boy reading, writing and how to worship\" and just at the moment when Durga (who is never sent to school ) sits on her father's lap, she says \"We'll find a good match for Durga\". Since gender equality is apparently in short supply, I hoped that she would at least get a good husband, or be resourceful enough to subsist inspite of a bad one.\n\nPeripheral players are expertly sketched in - notice the skillful strokes with which Ray limnes an ephemeral character- a shopkeeper ( Tulsi Chakrabarti - a Ray favorite) who chats with a dubious visitor while constantly flicking his eyes towards his pupils and barking admonitions. Entertainment in the village, considering this is the twentieth century, is still primitive but the the children have no choice and eagerly seek it - a mythological play filled with grandiose and beseeching characters, a contraption that shows pictures of the city. I find it impossible to ignore the constantly detected theme of societal safeguards suffering a breakdown - the inept father, the landowner unable to provide sustenance to those around him, a doctor's visit not having the intended long-term benefit, a motley group of characters who call themselves the \"town elders\" and who are neatly put in their place by an even-handed reply that tells them why their advice was not sought.\n \n    Aunt Indir -an elderly lady who is allowed occasionally to stay in the house- ranks as one of the memorably unique geriatric characters in cinema. Chunibala Devi blurs the line between reality and drama. Shorn of any artifice, we see only two teeth in her mouth: she is a nominally enhanced skeleton whom age has wizened, shrivelled and hunch-backed thoroughly.An apology for a saree drapes the remains of her body,the hair on her head is minimal and her eyes are half-closed - not one of us would bat an eyelid if she dropped dead the very next moment. One of the movie's emotional highpoints slides in early, when the old lady discovers a guava (a stealthy gift from Durga) in the fruit basket, and becomes open-mouthed and wide-eyed in sheer fascinated delight -one suspects Mahatma Gandhi himself couldn't have sported a a more sparkling visage if he had received the most rapturous news he could wish for .Anyway, we are surprised when we see strength suddenly coursing into her emaciated body - this happens when she energetically packs up her meager luggage in response to one of the strongest emotions seen in India down the ages - a mother-in-law's disapproval of her son's wife. Aunt Indir's personality is further coloured in with interesting character-deepening shades as the story progresses. One of Ray's directorial powers lies in the way he takes this potentially depressing character and transforms her (nay, looks more deeply at her even in passing) into a spunky octagenarian with no false notes.\n \nRavi Shankar's background music is judiciously deployed - there's a dysphoric drum-roll when a child is punished, a roiling ektara when Aunt Indir enters the house for a drink of water, an effervescent sitar when monsoon exposes the backsides of  lotus leaves. He only stoops to a melodramatic underline when the film's biggest tragedy is lamented, otherwise his elemental music is a perfect complement to this pastoral saga. \n \nWhile much of 1950s Indian black-'n'-white cinema focussed on story and melodrama while forgetting natural mise en scene, Pather Panchali is steeped in the redolence of Indian bucolia - Victuals drying atop a rock terrace, Brass vessel used for scooping up water, Rinsing the mouth and spitting out the water in the courtyard itself, Mother determined to feed rice into her child's mouth though the boy is disinterested and scampers around, Coconut grater with its crenellated blade protruding from the wooden platform on which the user sits, Tulsi plant sprouting atop a raised cuboid stone structure at the center of the courtyard....\n \n It has been noted that some major works of British-era India did not feature the colonialists at all-- as if they didn't exist or as though their presence was too temporary or inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Indirect evidence by way of train tracks aside, we don't really feel their absence here because the roles of oppression and neglect are ably assumed and upholded by the landowner's family. The landowner's wife is not bothered that Sarbojaya's family is starving, she only walks up to their house in an angry mood when some petty trash has been alleged to stolen by Durga. Her husband - the director has fun keeping his name as \"Ray\"- employs Hari without payment for three months, and is apparently so useless that he is never shown in this film.\n\nEven a casual look at Ray's own life is enough to suggest why he was attracted to this work. In the movie, Hari is a writer who mentions that he comes from a family of writers and scholars. Ray's grandfather and father were writers and scholars, while Ray himself composed stories and essays. Further strong comparisons between Apu and Ray will create spoilers for those who haven't watched Aparajito,anyway it is not unreasonable to posit that Ray strongly identifies (not just in directorial capacity) with the eponymous journeyman of the Apu Trilogy and may even regard him as his figurative son. Ray was fond of children, he became a successful writer of children's literature, and the depiction of kids in Pather Panchali is a textbook example of the formidably difficult task of how to direct young ones in movies. Pather Pachali's children create no complaint, either in their acceptance of their fate, or in their acting chops. Young Uma Das Gupta embodies Durga -the girl who glides through this story while minding her own business for the most part, humouring her brother and helping others. A cryptic layer of complexity slides in when the pre-adolescent Durga looks at her rich friend whom she has helped to get decked in the finery of bridal wear - the look on former's face carries full import only when one looks back at it after the movie's end. Apu, not just in this movie but also in the next instalment, is a boy who is good-natured to a fault - but what the heck, you need someone like lovely little Subir Banerjee to eventually balance out the brats in cinema. We see the famous close-up shot of his visage as it witnesses a punishment -his face recoils with terror once,the lens takes in his raven black locks of hair, wide open eyes glistening with fear, the tender flesh of his nascent face contrasted against the hard edges and rough texture of a pillar beside. Later when he reaches home after school and hears the cries of sorrow from inside the house, the camera creates a magnificently poignant shot by slowly zooming in on this little figure who has stopped in his tracks,his face quietly registering the pathos, chest swathed in a dark cloth, with an umbrella's handle jutting out from his figure like the prow of a ship- very early in life,the waves of trama and responsibility heave upon him.  \n\nIn a film full of amateur actors who are marvellous in conveying spontaneity and polish, Karuna Banerjee stands out as a prime example of effortless thespian finesse. Her Sarbojaya is a woebegone Indian caryatid bearing the weight of her collapsing household. Her smiles are landmarks in the movie. When she is not involved in assiduous domestic work, Sarbojaya is burdened by a countenance of brooding melancholia with which she gazes at the fathoms of her predicament. This is combined with an alacritous sharpness of mind that marks her out as a true lady of the house. She shrewishly snaps at Aunt Indir for taking up undeserving space, senses in a flash that Apu is asking for money when he runs up to his Dad (\"don't give him money!' she warns from outside the screen), defends her daughter against a taunting witch, runs in to rescue her son from a manhandling, and tries valiantly to prevent the house from falling to pieces when her husband is away. Apart from being a model of supportive feminity, she is more of a man than her husband.\n \n Apropos the man of the house - Hari (portrayed perfectly by Kanu Bannerjee)- I am convinced that Ray has a larger narrative in mind here. I feel he believes that men like Hari are no longer viable in India, that the country will die if men like him persist. Species like his, are seen as dinosaurs .Hari is a not a bad man, but we suspect he is pusillanimous, and a casualty towards the family that he is supposed to protect. Early in this story,he has lost his economically useful orchard thanks to the same old family wranglings and vendettas ,and it's likely that he was the timid one in the fight. Ostensibly lacking condoms or other contraceptive devices to prevent a swelling brood, he doesn't realize that his plans for new means of earning a living, are too unreliable to supply the badly needed finances. He is mature yet not aggresive enough. Early on,his wife reminds him of the ineptitude of his plans,but that still doesn't rouse him adequately. Yes he does take corrective action eventually when things fail to look up, but when he repeats \"God does everything for the best\", he over-stretches theological precepts and does not realize that we are duty-bound to exercise the God within ourselves. In Ashani Sanket, a dubious medical practitioner falls flat in a drought, in \"Nayak\" a filmstar is beset by doubts centering on real achievement in life, in Aranyer Din Ratri none of the three men impress, Jalsaghar features a disintegrating Zamindar, Seemabaddha shows a corporate man who seems to be climbing the stairs yet the end shows him racked by capitalistic doubts, Ghare Bhaire has an altruistic aristocrat who nevertheless tumbles into a sub-optimal end, and ultimate fecklessness is toplined in  the hilarious Shatranj Ke Khilari where the Nawabs fritter away their lives while the Brits earnestly carry on their rampage. One gets a continual feeling that the men in Ray's films struggle to be real men- there are exceptions of course but they are few.\n \nSubrata Mitra constructs the visual world here with the sure eye of a top artist. Colour would have destroyed this black-'n'-white chiaroscuro. High-resolution images would again have hardly flattered the man-made shambles which are enclosed here by the aesthetic-transcending woods. His first remarkable shot rolls in when he takes a close-up of little tomboyish Durga -fragile yet independent- crouching in the woods while stumps of bamboo give further gestalt to that composition. When the kids tail the candy-man in the hope of gratis sweets, the camera's gaze tilts onto a lake to record the mirror-image of that dreamy pursuit. When a chided daughter is grabbed by her tresses and dragged out by the mother ,he employs short-range shots to show the angry immediacy of the moment, but when the mother has despatched her out of the crumbling doors, and both are parties are collapsed in the trauma of the incident, he pulls back the frame to show a huge crater in the courtyard wall- the girl can easily step back in if she wanted to. Later when the little brother follows his elder sister in an attempt to re-establish camaraderie (after all, she is his only sure companion in these boondocks) the film floats without a care in the world, in the vast acreage of the fields. Trees give way to electrical utility poles sprouting porcelain insulators, and the train tracks loom. I half-expected Durga to ambush her kid brother as he wanders through this stillness, the screen graced by white arcing feathers of sugarcane flowers, but he is instead gently hit by a sugarcane stump - a gift from his sister sitting nearby.This is where the film establishes its strongest affinity with early Japanese cinema in monochrome- there's an abolutely unhurried tranquility to the scene, a sense of contemplation where there is ample breathing space - man and nature alone - as if you yourself are in that field.The film-maker here is not calibrating his work with the ring of the box-office register nearing 1000 crores, he'd doing what he feels to be his art and craft.\n \n   Cultivated consummately on the fertile material of Bibutibhushan Bandopadhyay's 1929 novel of the same name, Pather Panchali had a tepid reception in Calcutta for its home-country premiere but others made sure that Ray was not let down. Cannes spotlights popped, notorious queen of film reviewing - Pauline Kael- was impressed, mercurial critic of NYT Bosley Crowther conceded it engaged him while across continents, it riveted Akira Kurosawa. I was not too curious to find out Roger Ebert's liking for this movie because I sensed what his verdict would be.\n \nSo Pather Panchali's structure ripples with shifting shades of stoicism, and perhaps it is only a unsaid footnote that this way of life is no longer sustainable in an India of which Shashi Tharoor said \"contrary to popular belief ,India is not an under-developed nation, rather it is a highly developed country in an advanced state of decay\". Equally,I will never be able to refute the proposed counter-point that Ray accepts this state of affairs without complaint - it is a world falling to pieces but it is his duty to record rather than ameliorate -and in this, he is not far off from the wild-life documentarians who do not intervene even if the cub is dying while its mother is away. To better understand what Ray wanted to convey in entirety one has to peruse the rest of the series, nevertheless Pather Panchali undeniably stands by itself as a complete story. It purports are flung open for eternal interpretation, yet the movie roots itself as a sure portrait of mono no aware .One man sees the ship sinking, another sees it battling the waves, while the complete director in Ray reserves an inclusive vision that challenges judgement.\n \n \n UPN",

Satyajit Ray's 1st was especially frustrating for him due to completing about 40 percent of it and then having to take a 1.5 year hiatus due to lack of money despite it being a low budget film. The film is about the struggle to survive poverty of family in a village. They are so poor even their dirt poor neighbors react strongly to them. Either they pity them and want to help or conversely, are very annoyed by them, despite seeing their own futures in their suffering. The woman of the family works hard but is very annoyed by the old decrepit woman, her mother-in-law whom she resents because she cannot afford to take care of her. She constantly criticizes the unfortunate old woman, until the old woman, fed up, decides to wander off to the forest to die of exposure. In a legendary scene the young boy and girl (brother and sister) go off and \nplay in the forest , encounter the old woman in a crouched praying position and even talk to her assuming she is still alive. When she doesn't respond they gently push her and she topples over, a corpse. The father of the family disappears for months at a time trying to earn money. Sometimes he returns with money and all is well temporarily. Sometimes he works but does not get paid until months later. Whenever he is gone, his family is destitute and survives barely by eating the fruit that falls on the ground. Fruit that comes from an orchard that they actually used to own but had to give up to pay debts. They are called thieves every-time they are seen eating. Karma seems to rear up its ugly face due to the mistreatment of the mother-in-law. The young girl is accused of being a thief, apparently a necklace goes missing and the mother temporarily kicks her out of the home because of the shame.The young girl starts to get sick due to malnutrition. The village doctor shows up for a few minutes and says she will be well, only has a fever and will recover if she doesn't get the chills. But soon there comes a fierce rainstorm and they are so poor they have no doors or windows to avoid the storm coming in, only raggedly blankets that keep falling down. The girl takes a turn for the worse and dies. Then the father appears with gifts and money but the mother is too stunned to even speak to him. The hope of the family lies in young Apu ( the hero of the sequels, it is a trilogy, there are 2 sequels) who seems indestructible. Despite barely  eating, he never gets sick , never seems to lack energy. He is what keeps his parents sane. Eventually they decide to pack up and leave for the city, but not before getting a scolding from the village elders because six generations of that family has stayed in that village. As they move, Apu climbs to the top of the cupboard and finds a dusty, hidden necklace . He promptly throws it into the lake. The film is devastating, utterly powerful, and a legendary masterpiece.",

Every character in this film is painted wonderfully and the film real strength is to slowly have the young Apu becoming the central character in the story. Highly symbolic and very well thought, this film is purely and simply a masterpiece from the Indian world. A fantastic depiction of the daily life of a regular Bengalese family in 1955.",

The film may be a slow-burner, but it didn't take long for me to be impressed with it.\n\nThis is a sort of film that requires patience and the correct mindset for the audience, as Pather Panchali takes its time in fleshing out its characters and for any significant drama to actually occur. The film essentially follows an Indian family that resides in the province, exploring the physical, emotional, and psychological difficulties that they had to endure. I admire Satyajit Ray's handling of the film's story, allowing the film's complication be always present on its characters; their difficulties is not found during a single event, the battle is found in their daily lifestyle, trying to feed themselves, send the children to school, earning wages in order to make their living situation bearable.

I was fortunate enough to be part of the middle class section of society, therefore I never had to physically be in the position that the family in this film were in.\n\nBefore seeing this film, I had always somewhat envied the simplistic lifestyle and values of a province family, as from a distance I have always seen them as peaceful beings whose only goal in their day is to have the bare essentials. Pather Panchali has allowed me to see the situation in a more personal and intimate light; as of now, I could not be more grateful for the position I am in. The fact that I have an intact home, more than enough food to eat, and employment opportunities are not too difficult to come by, makes me both happy and sad.\n\nMy main issue with the film is that the pacing of the film feels too steady at times, lacking any sort of intensity or drama during the middle sections of the film. The film's 40 minutes has explored the family thoroughly, therefore by then the film should have delivered something that would impact its characters heavily, which the film does deliver but not until the final act of the film. It takes too long for the film to arrive at that point, leaving me a bit unfocused during the some of the events that takes place in the second act.\n\nThe choice of having the film be shot on location may be primarily due to the fact that the budget was limited for the production of this film, but I personally feel it helped capture the authenticity of the character's living situation.

            "content": "Apu's Beginning  \r\n\r\nI saw [i]Aparajito[/i] years ago--at the beginning of \"D,\" actually.  I'd just gotten the first [i]Great Movies[/i] book, and I backtracked for the ones I missed at that point.  I was having issues with Netflix at the time, and I wasn't that far ahead in the alphabet.  I'd been doing the project for maybe a year then, maybe a bit longer.  I didn't have that much to backtrack for--and I'm not sure why I'd missed the various movies in the first place.  It's an interesting thing to consider.  I've gone back and read my review of it, and I speculated that perhaps the reason I did not myself particularly consider it a Great Movie, though I certainly didn't think it was a bad one, was that I couldn't really get into Apu's head, particularly.  I thought he was foolish, and I thought he was foolish in an inappropriate, unbelievable way.  I suspected that seeing this one would let me get into his head better, and I think I was probably right.\r\n\r\nHarihar Roy (Kanu Banerjee) is a Brahmin whose family has long lived in a small town in India.  Unfortunately, in the 1920s, there's not a lot of money in it, and the family does actually need it.  His wife, Sarbojaya (Karuna Banerjee), wants him to return to the city and find work, even though they have a young daughter, Durga (Runki Banerjee then Uma Das Gupta), and she is pregnant.  The child is a son, Apu (Subir Banerjee).  Durga steals fruit from the neighbour's orchard; she shares it with old Indir Thakrun (Chunibala Devi), her great-aunt.  Sarbojaya dislikes Indir quite a lot; she resents having to care for her at all.  As the children grow older, they also grow closer.  Durga takes a certain amount of responsibility for her younger brother, about the only housework she sees much interest in.  She also sees it as her duty, I think, to care for Indir, and of course the whole family wants Harihar to come back, or at least send money and word of what he's doing.\r\n\r\nI must confess that I am not all that fond of Indian cinema.  Bollywood pretty well irritates me.  I find it amusing in small doses, but the longer the movie goes on, the less amusing I tend to find it.  And Bollywood?  Goes on for a bit.  This movie is only about two hours long, though I will admit that there are no charming but random dance sequences.  I can see the influence this had on later Indian film, but this is a lot more linear.  This is the childhood of Apu, the first half of the book, written by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, the second half of which we previously saw as [i]Aparajito[/i].  There are only a few characters, and they all follow paths that make sense.  This is, of course, extremely different from the more recent Bollywood epics and is much closer to the more \"arthouse\" Indian films that I do like, such as the films of Mira Nair and Deepa Mehta.  I don't think it would have been impossible to get Mira Nair without Satyajit Ray, but it would have been harder.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most notable thing about this film is that hardly anyone working on it had any experience.  Many of the performers were amateurs; some hadn't worked in film in decades, and some only have the single film credit to their names.  Ray had never directed a film before.  For all that, there is a joy to the film that underlies even the more depressing bits.  Durga dances in the rain at one point, and even though she sang the Indian equivalent of \"Rain, rain go away\" a few minutes earlier in the film, it's clear that she is enjoying the downpour.  They may be poor, and she may miss her father a great deal, but for this moment, she is happy.  The actress only ever made the one film.  Sometimes, when people get cast in movies look for unknowns, they go on to a quiet career.  Sometimes, they get \"discovered\" and go on to stardom.  And sometimes, as with Uma Das Gupta and others, they go on to lives that have nothing to do with film.  Cast and crew here seem about equally divided in what happened to them.  \r\n\r\nThe name of the film, as Rotten Tomatoes so kindly reminds us, literally translates to \"Song of the Little Road.\"  It was filmed for about $3000 (that's just a hair over $25,000 in today's money), and indeed, Ray had a hard time raising the money and had to suspend production for a while.  Eventually, the government of the State of West Bengal came to his aid and financed the film so he could finish it.  I assume this is because he was, after all, adapting a book by a great Bengali author, though I confess that my sources do not specify.  What delights me, however, is not merely that the West Bengali government decided, for whatever reason, that sponsoring a film was a good idea.  That does make me happy, because I think a sign of a great government is sponsoring the arts.  However, what delights me even more what how the whole thing was listed in the budget.  \"Pather\" means, as you might guess, something along the lines of \"path.\"  And in the budget, the money spent on the film was listed as \"roads improvement.\"",

            "content": "'Pather Panchali', the first one in Satyajit Ray's 'The Apu Trilogy', is a cinematic masterpiece, and the best one in the trilogy. The story, the characters, the situations, everything in this movie overflows with such excruciating reality and brilliance. It well-deservedly won the 'Best Human Document Award' at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.\n                      \nNo matter how old and slow the movie is, it's captivating and extremely absorbing from the very beginning, and shows the heights a film, at its best, is capable of achieving. It stands out because of its poetry, its humanity, its haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, and its remarkable portrayal of a family and a culture.\n\nBibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's impressive screenplay, along with Satyajit Ray's exceptional direction, portrayed through powerful performances by every actor in the movie, makes it the film that it is.\n\nRay's direction is top-notch and one-of-a-kind. The characters, their hopes and dreams, their behaviour and relationships - everything is shown with such brutal realism, relatability and poignancy. I was really able to empathize, and feel the angst and pain of the characters. And if this is not enough, imagine this was Ray's debut movie, and made on a budget that wouldn't buy a five-star meal these days!\nThe movie proves why Satyajit Ray is referred to as the Grand Master of World Cinema.\n                      \nThis first part in the trilogy takes you through the starting years of Apu's childhood when he was living in his ancestral home in Bengal, with his parents and sister. The dual themes of progress and loss form the core of this film, as well as the whole trilogy.\n\nOn a personal note, this is the best film I've ever seen which explores childhood so stunningly. The movie's places, characters and every other thing reminded me of something from my childhood; it was nostalgic and heart-wrenchingly beautiful. There are so many scenes of the siblings which remind wondrous events from one's childhood: the pursuit of a sweet-seller, running across white fields to catch a glimpse of a moving train, a simple picnic among friends in the forest, playfully getting wet in rain, and hiding some evidence so that the other sibling doesn't into trouble.\n\nEven the range of intriguing characters in the film is vast; the hardworking but seldom-present father, the overburdened mother, the innocent siblings exploring the world around them, the always complaining or blaming neighbour/landlord, and the old and usually silent old lady in the neighbourhood who's always in her own world. \n\nEven at this age, the Trilogy is considered to be one of the most important and brilliant pieces of Cinematic History. Legendary Japanese Filmmaker,  Akira Kurosawa once aptly said: \"Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.\"",

He, along with his sister, mother, aunt, and father, live in India's interior, where it is combination of jungle and fields. They are fairly poor, but are able to cope with life, even though the father at one point is working as a bookkeeper for a friend and eventually, has to travel away from home to find work elsewhere. The film shows the behaviours and surroundings of Apu very clearly and this genuine gem for the Bengali classic, with a very interesting looking at the hardships of those living in India decades ago. I was not as emotionally perplexed as I should have been, but it is still a very nice film, with some very unfortunate situations.",

So in 1955 he finally pulled of his very first film Pather Panchali. Which uses real location and amateur actors and is spoken in the minority language Bengali. Pather Panchali is the first film in the trilogy called \"The Apu Trilogy\" about the life of Apu Ray.\n\nThis film is about his early life as a five year old boy growing up in the pour and dirty village, Nischindipur in West Bengal. Apu lives wiith his mom, his father who's a priest, but dreams about being a writer. His elder sister Durga is always in trouble and always steels food from the neighbors which she gives to her old mothers aunt who also lives with them. Poverty and their living condition isn't a very plesant life and nature are in more control, specially when the great monsoon accrue every year.\n\nMy opinion about this film is that catches the perfect essence of poverty and rustic environment that many associate with India and it's large population. But the story might seems a little rustic itself. I wish that I could say I truly liked but the fact is that I find it sometimes a little boring and long and some times I don't care for neither of the characters. But I give it a marginal thumbs up.",

Black and white definitely adds something to the film. One of the best things about this film is that the interpretation is left up to you - just like life. I get the feeling my empathy will change from one character to another depending on my viewpoint of life. On this occassion I focused on the mother, her isolation, susceptibility to the opinions of others and how this distorted and transformed her intense love for her family into something wicked and ugly. I have huge admiration for the character insight provided by the director always shying away from telling the audience what to think or how to interpret it. \n\nStill puzzled by the long scene showing dragonflies and lilies on the pond. It was waaaaaaaay too long. Also the religious references were lost on me.",
