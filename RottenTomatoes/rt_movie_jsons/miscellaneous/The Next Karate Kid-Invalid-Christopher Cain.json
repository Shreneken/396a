    "summary": "Karate master Mr. Miyagi (Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita) goes to Boston to attend a military reunion. There, he visits with Louisa (Constance Towers), the widow of his former commander, and meets her granddaughter, Julie (Hilary Swank). Julie's parents were recently killed in a car accident, and she is still reeling from the loss. When Julie surprises Miyagi with her knowledge of karate, he takes her to a Buddhist monastery for training and to help her come to terms with her angst.",

The bullies and some moments were amusing and entertaining.  It's amazing this didn't ruin Hilary Swank's career.  Did I mention how positively annoying she was in this?  It's worth mentioning again.  It was nice seeing Pat Morita revise his role as Mr. Miyagi.  There wasn't enough karate action in this considering it's a karate movie.  I could have written a better story and script myself.  Honestly!  This was worth seeing once, but it's not likely that I'll ever waste my time watching it again.  It's not necessary for Cobra Kai to include any part of this in their show, particularly Hilary Swank.  She looked good, I'll say that much.",

While it was a nice trip to visit the fallen sensei, the movie is extremely weak.  In fact, I doubt any of the plot lines or characters will get cameos in the Cobra Kai series, as it is ultimately forgettable.  I suppose the monastery was the highlight of the movie.  The injured bird and hall monitor bullies weren't particularly believable.  The story also suffers because the audience already knows Miyagi, so the aha moments that build the Daniel and Miyagi rapport can't be rehashed.  In addition it lacked a story arc that sucked you in and allowed you to ignore some of the implausibility.",

Mr Miyagi is sadly still the same vague old Asian guy, there are somehow still bullies, which are now picking on a girl which is weird, and the stuff with the monks are nearly fell asleep watching. Speaking of the girl, it's fun to see Hillary Swank before she became big (that's the same for all actors though). However, Julie or whatever her name is is such an awful character. Imagine Daniel in the third one, but that's the starting point of the character and it just gets worse and worse when the movie progresses. Man, I truly do hate this movie. This movie makes the third one look like frickin Citizen Kane! The only kinda good thing that I actually enjoyed is like the boyfriend guy, McGowen I think is the name of the character, he's the stereotypical nice guy with a big heart, and it's played well enough by the actor which I'm just not remembering at the moment. Besides that, stay far\u2026and I do mean FAR\u2026away from this mess. Just watch Cobra Kai or the original movie for crying out loud!",

It turns into a sweet story, even after a fairly rocky start.\n\nThe villains are meh, a little iffy but fine... far better than those from 'The Karate Kid Part III', that's for sure. Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) is a little clich\u00e9-filled but still super endearing and likeable. A young Hilary Swank, in her first major film role, brings a solid performance as Julie. At first I wasn't convinced, but by the end I felt like I saw a positive journey with the character.\n\nIn my opinion, it's the best sequel to 1984's 'The Karate Kid'. That's a big surprise, considering the downward trajectory of the preceding two. Don't get me wrong, it's close to being a not so good film. However, for me, it just about floats above the required marker. I like it, can't lie.",

On the contrary, what makes this entry a disaster is the karate isn't the central theme of the movie anymore and instead gets replaced by more dramatic scene and useless character development. All of what was built in the previous installment is forgotten to let place to a new start that we never asked for.

            "content": "My mind knows this is a pretty stupid film and a needless spin off that nobody asked for. But having grown up watching this as a toddler in the 90's as well as the far superior Macchio predecessors, my heart knows there are some aspects in this that I somewhat enjoy. Miyagi is still charming as ever, Hilary Swank gives a solid performance even though her character is a forced b-word for the first 20 minutes of the film, I enjoy the cheesiness of antagonists Ned and Dugan, and at least this film retains the epic and soothing original score by Bill Conti.\n\nThat being said, the dialogue is amateur and seemingly written by a middle schooler at parts. For example: \"She was killed in an accident and their both dead\", really? So like, if a person is shot, you mean there's a bullet inside them? Or if you freeze to death, were you cold during the process? Talk about redundancy. Anyways, that's a minor pet peeve here.\n\nThere's also scenes that leave you scratching your head and asking \"why?\". For example, in this franchise, we've went from iconic moments like the crane kick, to monks dancing to The Cranberries here. From Miyagi beating up bullies dressed in skeletal Halloween costumes, to Miyagi bowling with his monk friends here. Talk about taking an iconic character and going over-the-top comedic with him. \n\nAlso, what's the deal with Julie's love interest Eric? He seems like a cool guy who's confident and good-hearted, yet he gets his ass kicked at every turn in this film. Is he related to the Daniel Larusso from Part 3?\n\nAnd even though I like Ned and Dugan's ridiculous characters and motovations, the fact is they are just that: ridiculous. You mean to tell me Ironside plays a drill sergeant teaching high school kids military tactics to learn how to be trained killers...riiight. Okay. Oh yeah, there's that moment in the final scene where Dugan tells Ned to finish off Eric. \"Finish him off\". Remember, these are high school kids lol.\n\nAnyways, this wasn't completely terrible and there are some things I like sprinkled around in the film. It's not the same without Daniel Larusso and his dynamic with Miyagi, but Swank delivers a good enough performance to slightly compensate for it. Anyone with a brain can't watch this without acknowledging its flaws and ludicrous plot points though. It's harmless and can be somewhat entertaining, but ultimately it's a fart-in-the-wind addition to the franchise.",

Maybe the best thing was the foreshadowing that Swank would become such a great actress.\n\nThe biggest complaint I can see is that it is really just a reboot of the original, only with a female lead this time round. We do get a mention of Daniel, but that is all of him in this one.\n\nBut same plot. Girl is being picked on by bullies at school and learns to fight them back. Morita gets a lot of screen time here and like before, is quite good. Swank is really good here. You can tell she does all her own stuff, and I found her really good looking here too.\n\nIronside is okay as the thug leader, but he doesn't get very much screentime. Another thing that bugged me was the amount of harassment and violence he and his boys get away with in this film. But look for Walt Goggins as one of the lesser thugs.\n\nThe boyfriend character looks like he's 35, so yeah...wtf?\n\nBut everything here is just not as good as in the original, but it's not all awful.\n\nBut come on: Bananarama trumps The Cranberries any day of the week! :)",
