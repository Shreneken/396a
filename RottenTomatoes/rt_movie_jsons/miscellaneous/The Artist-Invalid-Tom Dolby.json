            "content": "A moving, if sometimes slightly disjointed look at the life of a wife who gave up her pursuit to be an artist to support the painting career of her talented, famous and affluent but capricious and egotistical husband, a challenge made all the more difficult by the onset of Alzheimer's disease, making him more volatile and unpredictable than ever. The dynamics of a woman torn between wanting to support her beloved and pull away to attend to her own needs are examined in multiple permutations, presenting a profile of a character frustrated while attempting to be conciliatory in multiple regards. The superb lead performances by Lena Olin and Bruce Dern, backed by a fine supporting cast, really make this picture, helping it shine even when its sometimes-meandering narrative lets them down. A worthwhile candidate for awards season, especially in the acting categories.",
