    "summary": "After being blown away by a team of FBI agents, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) needs to find a way to overcome certain death. When his bloodied remains are sent to the morgue, his heart, still intact, is able to hypnotize a coroner and take over his body. After brutally dispatching a couple of FBI agents, he heads back to his favorite stomping grounds: Crystal Lake. Jason commences another teen massacre while a bounty hunter (Steven Williams) discovers the only way to kill him.",

            "content": "Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday is the ninth film in the slasher film franchise that reinvents Jason Voorhees, the undead killer who haunts Camp Crystal Lake, as a body-hopping demon. The film follows a bounty hunter named Creighton Duke, who knows the secret of Jason's origin and how to kill him for good. He teams up with a reporter named Steven Freeman, who is the ex-boyfriend of Jessica Kimble, the last living relative of Jason. Jason is after Jessica and her baby, as he needs to possess them to be reborn. Steven and Duke must protect Jessica and her baby from Jason and his followers, while also trying to stop him once and for all.\n\nThe film is directed by Adam Marcus, who also co-wrote the film along with Jay Huguely and Dean Lorey. The film stars John D. LeMay, Kari Keegan, Steven Williams, Steven Culp, Kane Hodder and others. The film also features the return of Kane Hodder as Jason, who plays the role for the third time.\n\nThe film is a controversial and divisive entry in the franchise, as it changes the mythology and style of the series. The film is more supernatural and gory than the previous ones, but it also has some humor and references to other horror movies. The film is not very faithful or consistent to the established lore of the series, but it also has some creative and original ideas. The film is not very scary or thrilling, but it is interesting and entertaining for fans of the genre.\n\nJason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday is a bold and bizarre slasher film that tries to do something different with Jason and his legacy.",

Bloated and fat, his head looks like someone glued marshmallows to it. It's the worst look in the entire series. The only thing this movie has going for it is some of the kills, which admittedly, are good. But all that aside, it's the story. That awful story. Jason is actually a large worm that has to relocate to another body when his is destroyed. Then he has to jump from body to body to survive and the only way to kill him is for one of his relatives to stab him with a special dagger that some guy in black has been lugging around. It is so ridiculously convoluted. The premise for a good Friday film is simple. Have Jason in the woods killing people. Make the kills creative, make the atmosphere creepy, and have one or two competent survivors left to face off against Jason. That's it. That's what works. Not this garbage.",

            "content": "'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off.\n\n'Jason Goes to Hell' for me is one of the worst of the 'Friday the 13th' films, a strong contender even for the worst. Is it irredeemably awful? No, not quite, don't think any of the 'Friday the 13th' films are. Then again this is coming from somebody who tries to see the good in bad films etc. and even tries to say where good to great films etc. could be improved on, not somebody who hates on everything or declare every film seen a classic. Sadly though, despite not caring hugely for the previous two instalments, 'Jason Goes to Hell' is indicative of the series has gone to hell.\n\nAre there good things here in 'Jason Goes to Hell'? Yes there are. The highlights are the tense opening scene and the slicing in half death (very strange but both disturbing and not easy to forget). Kane Hodder does a lot with little and is suitably creepily intimidating.\n\nThere are instances too where the film is also inventively shot.\n\nOn the other hand, while a good deal of 'Friday the 13th' films are silly, the silliness here is overkill that it becomes insultingly ridiculous. It is certainly the most bizarre film in the series, and not in a good way, and it completely gets in the way of scares or suspense. 'Jason Goes to Hell' overdoes just as much on the weirdness as it does with silliness. A lot fails to make sense, with too many parts confusing the story, and things that beg for an explanation are left unexplained, anything explanations are like the previous films didn't happen because so much doesn't fit.\n\nHodder aside, the acting is really poor, even for the 'Friday the 13th' films where acting rarely was a strength. Likewise with the dialogue, which is 'Friday the 13th' at its most taking-simplicity-to-extremes, stilted, cheesiest and lacking in taste.\n\nNothing is truly scary here, apart from the opening and one memorable death and suspense is nil. The kills are generally neither creative or shocking (going for more quantity, with a very large body count, than quality where gore feels too much and gratuitous. The pacing is far too hectic, the film never stops moving and everything here feels incredibly rushed, and this hurts the atmosphere and the storytelling. 'Jason Goes to Hell' is also the first film in the series where the music score is a drawback and not a redeeming feature, not only does the music sound cheap here it also is so discordant with what's going on and like it was written for a different film.\n\nConcluding, not a good film and indicative of a severe decline of a variable series of films. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

In what I consider to be one of the greatest genre-breaking openings in horror, our favorite hockey-masked mutant is ambushed by an FBI task force. Blown to smithereens by a mortar grenade, Jason is reduced to several dozen pieces of rotted flesh. In the next jaw dropping scene, Jason's pitch black heart calls out to a corner. Possessed by an unstoppable urge, the corner eats the vile thing with the manners of a starved child. All of this happens within the first ten minutes of this movie and it keeps up its level of insanity and depravity for another eighty minutes. What people really don't appreciate about this movie is that it treats Friday the 13th as almost a separate mythology. Jason as we know him is only in the film at the bookends and Camp Crystal Lake makes two brief cameos -this film is about something different...I find it very well made, considering it was done by a twenty three year old who had never directed anything before (and it seems Goes To Hell didn't carry him to a successful career). This movie should be watched by all genre fans, because you're bound to either loathe it, or love it, as I do.",

It doesn't resemble a ‘Friday the 13th' movie in anyway, other than Jason being in the beginning of the film. The acting is back to being awful and the story is so stupid you get bored of watching it in the first 15 minutes.\nThe film begins with Voorhees's body being detonated by the FBI and, after his spirit possesses the coroner examining his remains, he uses the coroner's body to continue his killings.\nAlso, the last time we saw Jason he was in Manhattan and he was somehow turned back into a kid, in this movie he is again a walking corpse. I can live with that, but then he gets blown up, they made it look so easy, they should have done that from the start. Now though it gets strange as Jason becomes something from those body snatcher movies.\nOver, this is going to be a quick review because this movie isn't even worth discussing in length and it makes me angry. I don't recommend this to anybody.\n.5/5",

            "content": "There's only thing that can TRULY kill Jason Voorhees (or is it Vorhees, according to the mailbox on the Voorhees' house) isn't any force on this universe, supernatural or otherwise, it's poor box office returns.  Though, if you consider the budget for this movie (only $3 million) and the fact that it made five times that very same budget, really surprises me that this film has been in relative dormancy.  Since this film's release twenty-six years now, only three further Jason-related movies have been released, Jason X, Freddy vs Jason and the remake.  This is compared to the nine (including this one) that were released from 1980-93.  I don't know why I mentioned that, but I guess it was worth noting.  Having said all of that, though, what's the first thing that you think about when you hear the name of Friday The 13th???  Jason Voorhees and if you didn't know that then something is really wrong with you.  Anyway, you'd figure that a movie billed as 'The Final Friday' would see Jason Voorhees running roughshod over whatever unfortunate town he chooses to stalk, in this case his hometown.  And, in a way, I guess you could say that is the case.  But there's one big difference, however, and that is that Jason Voorhees, in this spirit, is now more of a spirit that inhabits the bodies of humans that he comes across in order to carry out his killing spree.  To say that Kane Hodder appears as traditional Jason in less than five percent of this movie is a fucking understatement.  Seriously, for a movie called Jason Goes To Hell, Jason Voorhees as a physical presence is literally nowhere to be seen.  He's killed off at the very beginning and, everything after that, is his spirit jumping from body to body until he can be reborn, which he can only do through a relative (living or dead).  People see REALLY quick reflections of the actual Jason in the mirror, that's how they know who he actually is.  This is really kind of a laughably bad idea.  I mean, supposedly, this is supposed to be the last Friday the 13th movie and it features very little of the actual character that people most associate with the franchise.  Like the series finale of The Sopranos without Tony Soprano.  It's just a ridiculous fucking concept and to think that that was something that would actually fly for longtime fans of the franchise was absurd.  This is something you do for the fifth or sixth sequel, not the (supposedly) last Friday movie.  Jason Voorhees needed to be a more imposing (literally) physical presence in order for any of this to feel remotely satisfying.  Because of that, it should be obvious that this movie is just no fucking good, outside of a cool Evil Dead easter egg that connects this universe to that one.  In all seriousness, this movie is really fucking bad.  The plot is hokey, even for this franchise's standards, the acting isn't particularly good, the writing is even worse.  And, yet, in spite of all of that, I had a fucking blast watching this.  I'm not giving this a positive rating, like, at all.  Part of me wonders how much of this was meant to be so bad it's good, but there's also a part of me that felt that this movie was wildly incompetent and, at this point, they were just literally scraping the bottom of the barrel to justify one final sequel.  I'm a bit on the fence, but I know that I had a lot of fun laughing at this movie and, very rarely, with it.  I think, however, that as much as fun as I did have with this movie, I don't think this movie ever reaches The Room levels of badness, where it sort of ingratiates yourself into your life and alters your DNA in a really beautiful way.  This movie, however, despite giving me a good laugh, is really kind of forgettable in so many ways.  The fact of the matter is that, to me, the Friday The 13th franchise, while definitely one of the most enduring in all of horror, in terms of quality, has never been as good as, say, Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween and/or Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  The first movie in the Friday the 13th franchise is not nearly as good as the first entries in Nightmare or Halloween or Chainsaw.  And that might have to do with the fact that Jason Voorhees, as the hulking, goalie mask wearing serial murderer that we know him as, first appeared in the THIRD movie.  The second featured the same Jason as a serial murderer, but he wore a bag over his head.  The traditional hockey mask came with the third movie.  So, you could say that, in many ways, the first two installments of the franchise were attempting to figure out who this character was going to be and, as a result, these entries might not necessarily have been as good as its contemporaries at the time.  And that's not saying that Halloween or Nightmare didn't have some stinkers, because they did.  That's also not saying that all the movies in this franchise are bad either, as I think the fourth one is actually the best of the ones I've seen, even if I wouldn't call it good.  It's just that the quality of these movies have, generally, tended to be worse than its contemporaries, in my opinion.  Neither here nor there, I suppose.  I just think that, in so many ways, this franchise (and the Halloween franchise is also guilty of this) became so hokey with the sequels, with Jason basically being an unkillable monster.  Well, unkillable unless a specific set of circumstances occurred where he could be, momentarily, eliminated.  He has regenerative powers and whatnot.  And the franchise sort of got away from what it probably should have been by embracing some really stupid and absurd ideas to keep the franchise going, sort of like the Saw franchise twenty years later.  And this is a last ditch attempt to go even further into the hokey and the supernatural and, honestly, it doesn't pay off.  I think this movie would benefit from the very same thing that revived the Halloween franchise last year.  It needs to strip everything back and tell a more straightforward story about a guy wearing a hockey mask that goes around killing people around Crystal Lake.  No supernatural elements, no camp (well, a little camp never hurt anyone) and no fucking spirits jumping from body to body (even if that is covered under the supernatural description).  Again, I had a lot of fun with this movie.  It's so campy and bad that you can't help but laugh.  But to say that it's a worthy conclusion to such a long-running horror franchise, at least at the time of its release, would be a fucking lie.  Though I do like the ending, where Freddy's gloved hand bursts out of the dirt and drags Jason's mask down to hell, I think.  I need to see Freddy vs Jason again, see how that holds up.  But this was a disappointing movie.  Funny in how bad and campy it is, yes, but still a disappointment.  I can't really recommend it in any way, but I did have my fun laughing at it.  So if you know what you're getting into, then you should watch this and have some chuckles at its expense.  If you're wanting something that's a little more serious and a worthy conclusion to the franchise, then you need not apply.",

Super huge plot holes, directorial mistakes that cheapen the experience, characters who have no relation to each other that are impossible to care about, stiff wooden acting from everyone except the bounty hunter, and a depiction of police that is so unbelievable so as to make the Andy Griffith Show look like COPS.  People just dont act like this in real life.  The few fight scenes are completely unbelievable, and there are so many crucial plot moments that are never shown or explained.  How did Freeman get out of jail?  Why was the police officer talking to him not his lawyer?  Repeatedly the film draws out scenes which aren't super important, and skimps on scenes that are, sort of expecting the viewer to use their imagination, I guess.  Accordingly, the film relies on cheap expository dialogue and doesn't seem to have heard that you're supposed to \"show, not tell\".   The film clearly blew its entire budget on the last 15 minutes and drew out the scene in which Jason faces off Freeman, in which he does some sort of cheesy beatdown and doesnt just kill him, and Freeman sorta just gets up like nothing happened and this big dude didnt just lay the smackdown on him.  Like, what?  Otherwise, the combination of the stretched out ending and the stretched out expository dialogue where the bounty hunter overacts and everybody else underacts, contrasting with the skimped over everything else, cringeworthy acting, unbelievable dialogue, nonexistent character design, and gaping jupiterian plot holes render this movie so bad its not even comically bad.  Its just bad and unwatcheable.  The youth of the director and the rushed nature of the writing and production really shows here.",

One praiseworthy thing I will give it is the supporting cast, who are actually incredibly likable.  This whole town of people are full of personality, and I was actually worried when they were getting killed off.  If you have friends who like laughing at bad movies, itâ(TM)s great for that, but itâ(TM)s not a good movie.",

From there it is all downhill as the story goes from weird to gross to nearly unwatchable until it reaches its crescendo.

The idea that Jason is simply a spirit that can travel between bodies is not new as it was in a couple of the earlier films, but this film took it further by having him jump between a total of 4 different people before being reborn. This movie is something you need to watch if you want to complete the Friday the 13th series, but otherwise steer clear. Watching a grown man eat a still beating heart or several people extending a disgusting elongated black tongue into others mouths or knowing the spirit of Jason is reborn by a corpse, these things are not worthy of the average movie watcher and should be avoided.",

This is the worst version of Jason I've seen, his design (when he's on-screen) is ugly, and he makes dumb noises and grunts a lot (including when he's being gunned down). For most of the film, Jason is just a bunch of random people, none of whom are intimidating or frightening (freaky, maybe....but scary, no). I also didn't care for Steven Williams as Bounty Hunter Creighton Duke, who isn't in the film much, serves next to no purpose, and is an antagonistic asshole for most of the scenes he appears in.  I like John D. LeMay as Steven (our hero), and I appreciate just how far the film goes with the violence but it makes many weird, half-assed choices that don't make much sense. Jason Goes To Hell is certainly more watchable and  entertaining (in a groan-inducing way) than A New Beginning and The New Blood, but I'd say this is still likely the worst installment in the Friday the 13th franchise.

His still beating heart somehow mesmerizes the coroner who ends up eating the heart and becomes possessed by Jason. It's absolutely bat shit crazy. Throughout the film he keeps transferring body to body eventually trying to find the body of a Vorhees to become resurrected. And who is that? Well turns out Jason had a half sister that was never ever mentioned in the last 15 or so years of these damn films and her name is Diana Kimble (Erin Gray), but the real focus here is her daughter Jessica (Kari Keegan) and her new born daughter Stephanie. Along for the ride is Jessica's ex-boyfriend Steven Freeman (John D. LeMay) who actually is more of the main character than Jessica. Jason keeps chasing them all after Steven finds out from a way over the top bounty hunter named Creighton Duke (Steven Williams) reveals the backstory to this all. It's up to Steven to save Jessica (or maybe it's the other way around) and to finally make sure Jason get's put down for good! Ok so there's a few positives to this film. Maybe since it came out in 1993 and it had been four years since the last film it finally feels a bit more modern than the previous films. It still has some cheesy moments, but the film has a decent pace. It's also the goriest of all the other films. Which is either good or bad for ya if you like that. The bad here is that Jason is barely in this film! Yes he \"possesses\" the other people, but you see them representing Jason. We see him in the mask for the first five minutes and the last ten minutes, it's just doesn't feel like a Friday the 13th film as much as the others. The whole plot with having a half sister too are just ridiculous. Overall, not the best \"ending\" to the franchise (which obviously it didn't since a few more came out).

Kane Hodder does briefly appear in the film as Jason and in another bit part as a security guard, but there is sadly not enough Jason to make this film it all that interesting for fans expecting to see the familiar hockey masked killer. There is a clever opening scene to the film that kind of mocks all of the previous films, with a young woman at a camp at night along getting ready to shower when Jason attacks. She ends up being an undercover FBI agent sent to lure Jason out into an ambush what literally blows him to bits and metaphorically blows up the formula of the previous films. Also on the plus side you do get Erin Gray in the film, a score by original composer Harry Manfredini, the original film's director (Sean S. Cunningham) returning as producer, and a funny final tag at the end of the film that teased (SPOILER ALERT) a Freddy vs. Jason film, which in reality didn't materialize until 10 years later. More interesting, I read that the film features the the skull dagger and Necronomicon from \"Evil Dead II,\" although I missed it, but teases a Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash film, which has yet to materialize outside of comic books. Overall, this one is probably not recommended for anyone outside of fans of the series who need to be completionists and see all of the series entries, even if this \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" like approach is markedly different from all of the previous films.",

That's eight films in ten years, and while the quality usually betrayed those short production times, they always felt like kin. Spiritual relatives. It took four years for a ninth chapter to see the light of day, plus a switch from Paramount to New Line Cinema, and somewhere along the way there was a great disconnect. A true B-grade picture in every sense, Jason Goes to Hell is the worst Friday yet, and one of the most desperate, flailing, pointless films I've ever seen. Though veteran blade-swinger Kane Hodder has returned to the role, this Jason bears little resemblance to the cool, creepy psycho killer of the earlier films. Inflated and deformed, at this point he's basically a roid-raging leper in a twisted, vaguely-familiar hockey mask, but he's changed in more than just a physical sense. The story revolves around his black heart, literally migrating from host to host to inspire fresh killings after Jason himself is blown to bits in the opening scene. We've swallowed some absurdly stupid plot devices over the course of this franchise, including a similarly lame-brained \"fake Jason\" angle in 1985's A New Beginning, but this one sets an awful new standard. It plays like cruddy straight-to-video '90s gimmick horror, not the quaintly under-produced slasher material that had typified the series to this point. Needless to say, the acting hasn't improved (somehow, impossibly, it's actually grown much worse) and the production values, which enjoyed a well-deserved bump in Jason Takes Manhattan, are once again cut-rate and pitiful. Not a good look for New Line, proving right out of the gates that they don't understand what they're making and don't honestly care, one way or the other.",

There was nothing fun about this film. Absolutely nothing. This entire film is a failed attempt directed horribly to get money out of more people who were expecting something entertaining. The plot, the characters, the dialogue, the missing of Jason Voorhees in the movie, everything is so unbelievably poor. Your probably wondering about the plot; \"Isn't it the same?\" No, it's not the same. The location of the film is not even Camp Crystal Lake. The location is a restaurant and a hospital. Yeah. Anyway, this mess centers around Jason Voorhees being murdered by a SWAT team and him being sent to the morgue. A medical doctor doesn't think Jason is dead though, so he eats Jason's heart. Of course, doing that, he turns into Jason basically, with Jason taking over his body and Jason trying to find a new body. The plot then centers around this couple having a baby, and the husband gets killed by the new body controlled by Jason with the old body turning evil with Jason leaving him and taking the baby so he can kill Jason? Yeah, this is terrible. This is honestly nothing. It's not even bad, it's not enjoyable. It's not bad, it's terrible. This is REALLY terrible. It's not even dissapointing, it's just sad they would actually try and make this and slap the Friday The 13th title on it. This is honestly more of a low budget horror film made for the television network SyFy then a theater released Hollywood horror film. This film is a complete waste of time that shouldn't be watched by anybody, it shouldn't have even been made. I honestly don't even remotely see what they were trying to do with this film, because the film didn't even go anywhere. I wanted to re-watch it to actually see if the film was understandable but I didn't because i knew it wasn't, so here's what I do remember. The film starts off with this random girl going to a cabin in Camp Crystal Lake. Now after this, Jason Voorhees attacks, and then the SWAT team basically kills him. I don't know if the girl was told to do that so the SWAT could kill him or the girl just randomly showed up there and decided to shower because that's literally what she does. Jason is then taken to the morgue and this medical doctor thinks he's still alive so he eats Jason's heart and Jason basically controls his body, so he kills some people in the hospital. After that, it's basically Jason going to different bodies while showcasing people's problems and events that have absolutely NOTHING to even do with Friday The 13th. The couple's problems, the doctor's past, the restaurant's problems, the hospital's problems, the problems with having a baby, the birth of the baby, the doctor turning evil again, a new couple, it just goes on and on and on with pointless dull filler that basically adds nothing exciting or new. This film is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's pretty harsh but this film is extremely awful and completely brainless and pointless.",

            "content": "After the failure of \"Friday the 13th Part VIII:Jason Takes Manhattan\" and the 80's ending,the series' rights were bought by New Line Cinema.Slasher films weren't as popular in the 90's and it was decided that this would be the final film in the series and it would be called \"Jason Goes To Hell:The Final Friday\".New Line must have been really stupid to think that people were going to fall for the \"Friday the 13th:The Final Chapter\" thing again.However,it was the last film in the series until \"Jason X\" came out in 2002.\n\n\"Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday\" stars John D.LeMay,Kari Keegan,Steven Williams,and Allison Smith and the film is directed by Adam Marcus.In the beginning of\"Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday\",a girl arrives to a cabin in the woods of Camp Crystal Lake in which you know who shows up.However,FBI agents blow Jason up to bits in which his body is taken to a morgue in which the coroner eats Jason's heart and Jason's soul transfers into the coroner's body.Afterwards,Jason is reduced to a worm creature that transfers Jason's soul into other people's bodies.I actually like the plot of the film because of how different it is from the other films.The idea of Jason's soul being transferred from one body to another is an interesting concept.It's not the same old stuff and for that I commend this film for trying something different.\n\nThe acting in \"Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday\" isn't great,but it's a huge improvement over the acting in the previous film.John D.LeMay isn't great in his role as the main character Steven.Kari Keegan is alright in her role as the character of Jessica.Steven Williams is good in his role as the character of Creighton Duke who is a Dr.Loomis type character.He's basically a bounty hunter who's been hunting Jason Voorhees for years.Besides the plot,there are some other things I like.One is the kills.This movie does not suffer like the last four installments and this movie is gory.You see every kill in this movie explicitly and it is awesome.The best kill in the whole movie is when Jason rams a spear through a girl's chest and dissects her.The special effects are outstanding in this movie.I would say this film has the best effects in the whole series besides the effects in \"Friday the 13th Part VII:The New Blood\".Everything from the blood effects to the worm creature is amazing.Jason also looks amazing.It's the best design for Jason in the whole series.His mask looks great and I love how it barely fits his large head.The ending is also awesome.At the end,Jessica kills Jason and a bunch of demons drag Jason to hell.Steven and Jessica and their baby then walk into the sunset in which you see Jason's hockey mask in the dirt.The camera zooms in on the mask in which Freddy Krueger's glove pops out of the ground and grabs Jason's mask.When I first saw the ending,I went absolutely crazy and it was the best way to set up \"Freddy vs.Jason\".\n\nThere are some bad things in the movie though.My biggest problem with the movie is there are a ton of plot-holes.The biggest is it's never explained how Jason is alive after the events of \"Friday the 13th Part VIII:Jason Takes Manhattan\".In the end of that film,Jason was melted by toxic waste and it's never explained how he's alive and well in this movie.Also,it's never explained what the worm creature is whatsoever.There are plenty other plot holes in the movie that I could talk about for a while.The characters in the film are not very good.The only real memorable character is Creighton Duke and that's it.Every other character is bland and stupid.The movie is also too weird for its own good.Half the time,this doesn't even feel like a \"Friday the 13th\" film and instead it feels like an \"Evil Dead\" movie.Heck even the Necromonicon from \"The Evil Dead\" makes an appearance in the film.My final problem with the film is Jason is hardly in it.Granted he's in,but only for seven minutes.Seven minutes is how long Jason is in this movie.At least he's cool when you see him,but still seven minutes.\n\nOverall,\"Jason Goes to Hell:The Final Friday\" is a decent entry in the series.It's not one of the best,but it's still a fun movie.The story is interesting,the kills are awesome,the effects are great,Jason looks amazing,and the film has a great ending.However,there are a lot of plot holes,the characters aren't very good,the movie is too weird for its own good,and Jason is hardly in it.I don't think it's a great movie by any means,but it's a fun movie and I think it's underrated.It is better than the film that proceeded it and the sequel to this film.\n\nGrade:B-",

            "content": "Jason Goes to Hell, although still part of the official franchise timeline, can be viewed as a stand-alone effort for several reasons. It was the first (and only) F13 film released during the 1990s, the first to lack the \"Friday the 13th\" title card, lives by its own set of \"Jason rules\", and was, like its predecessor, entirely ignored by future sequels. By \"Jason rules\" I mean the newly introduced concepts that (a) Jason is a parasitic, body-hijacking demon who is seeking to destroy his remaining family because (b) only a member of the Voorhees bloodline can definitively kill him. It's a lot to swallow in one sitting so let's start from the top.\n \nThe film begins with an excellent cold open, dropping the audience almost immediately back into a darkened camp and recreating the kind of stark suspense we haven't seen since Part 2. Unfortunately it's also the highlight of the movie and the only point where it resembles a Friday the 13th film. Jason is dispatched as quickly as he's introduced and from there we get heart eating, body-jumping, and 90s lady bangs. The body of this picture in no way resembles the aesthetic we've come to know and your level of enjoyment depends on how willing you are to accept these fundamental changes. \n \nI must comment on how stupid Jason's makeup is in this movie. He looks like a dirty ball of hamburger meat dropped in hair clippings that someone slapped a mask onto. Also, what's with the all denim outfit? I don't remember him being so coordinated with his fashion. Maybe it's better we were spared the sight of that greasy Canadian tuxedo for most of the film.\n \nThere's one clear question a fan has to answer when watching this: is the concept of Jason as an invading symbiotic organism stupid? Probably but, the way I look at it, at least he's in the movie. I certainly dislike how little screen time the hockey mask gets but I also respect the writers for doing something new that isn't cheesy or a thoughtless gimmick. New Line doesn't afford us much of a respite from that behavior moving forward so we must be grateful.\n \nAnother change is that Jason Goes to Hell doesn't follow the same formula as the other films and has more of an action, shoot-em-up feel. Again, this isn't what I'm looking for in one of these films but it does keep you interested throughout in ways that bad installments of the Classic Era failed to do. Leaving the camp removes most of the suspense and the abundance of filming locations eliminates any sense of claustrophobia. Director Adam Marcus also focuses on making the film self-referential and fun with varying degrees of success. It isn't campy in the way Jason Lives was but the film still gives a wink and nudge to series aficionados.\n \nJason Goes to Hell was, and is, a polarizing entry for franchise fans. Some admire its effort to go somewhere original while others feel the new \"Jason rules\" spit in the face of established series continuity. Personally I share both points of view and wish the writers would have kept things at camp where these movies are most likely to succeed. The Freddy Krueger gag at the end is another flat conclusion in a franchise with a rich tradition of idiotic endings. Unluckily for us it also led to a cringe-inducing feature film that set American horror cinema back several generations. Stay tuned.",

There is chasing, but it isn't as tedious as before. There is one thing I actually liked about the movie, which was the last thirty seconds. I won't spoil it, but I thought it was pretty cool.  All that said, it has many, many faults. Remember the end of the last movie? Jason was in Manhattan. Now for no reason, he's back at Crystal Lake and I have no idea why. The characters are still idiots. There were many points in the film where I yelled at the screen for them to do the obvious. Lastly, our main character gets several fingers broken fairly early on in the film. Alright fine. I don't have a problem with that. What I do have a problem with is that later, he is seen punching people and doing other various things that require the use of hands.",

            "content": "At this point, I'm simply trying to complete watching the entire franchise. I've made it through the first 8 films, why stop with only 2 remaining?\n\nI went into this, for the first time in the franchise with the lowest of all possible low expectations. The biggest duds of the franchise so far are Part 5 and 8, the latter being arguably being the worst of the two.\n\nAfter obviously realizing how terrible that Part 8 entry, Jason Takes Manhattan was, Parmount decided to sell the right of the Friday franchise to rival studio, New Line Cinema, owner of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.\n\nI am under the assumption that New Line felt they could turn the franchise around (why else would they buy it?) which is surprising seeing that their own Nightmare franchise had been on life-support for 4 or so years. \n\nWell, long story short, they most certainly didn't turn the franchise around. Jason Goes to hell may not be as bad as Part 8 or Part 5, but it's damn close. I strongly recommend passing unless you are like me and just trying to complete the series\n\nReview Points:\n\n - This movie feels and looks unlike any other movie before it. You can definitely feel New Line Cinema's influence. The directing, camerawork, atmosphere feels very similar to the Nightmare movies.\n\n- I was a genuinely a little excited 15min in after what appeared to be a meta angle, similar to Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) : The movie begin with the routine stalking/kills sequence of a teen unrelated to the story (usually to just to get the audience excited) Well, unlike other opening sequences, the teens gets away and is chased to what looks like a movie set. Then about two dozen cops began opening fire on Jason, in an action-movie like fashion, until he blows up (guts exploding everywhere) By all accounts, this looks like a movie within a movie parodying the Friday the 13th franchise.\n\nUnfortunately it's not. It is simply real sting-like operation set up by cops to lure Jason to them. Sigh.\n\n- Jason looks awful. Why in the bloody hell did New Line Cinema think they needed to redesign him? Give me Jason from Part 7 every damn time, please.\n\n- Friday (9) doesn't follow the story established in the first 8 films, instead opting to craft a new mythology for Jason. The movie introduces the concept that Jason is an entity that can travel body to body as well as be immortal unless killed by a member of the Vorhees family (with a magical dagger). While these are ludicrous in itself, they also transform Jason into a Freddy Krueger-like monster and one resembling an Alien. It's all very hard to swallow.\n\n- Most of the film revolves around the remaining members of Jason's family and some police characters. No teen characters/protagonists in Friday\n\n- By far one of the most graphic sex scenes of the franchise. I'm all for nudity and the grindhouse-exploitation angle, but this felt more on the lines of a porno; it was pretty awkward.\n\n- Some pretty gruesome (and funny) kills in Friday 9. It's unfortunate they didn't come from Jason, though. The kill after the above-mentioned sex scene was a graphic as any kill in the franchise. Holy moly.\n\n- It is absolutely incredible how long it took New Line Cinema to follow through on their twist ending. I can't imagine how disappointed fans were to see Freddy Krueger and the promised of a Jason x Freddy film, only to have to wait 10 more years.",

Hollywood just does that so they can get you to shell in a few bucks. The sucker is you unless you're smart enough not to believe it's the final one and want to see it anyway then by all means go for it! You won't be disappointed.\n\nThis one is the Friday the 13th series is more like a body snatchers type of movie with Jason's eel like evil is vomited into the mouths of his victims in order to pass along his evil doings into innocent people. What happened was that in the beginning of the film, Jason was led to a trap where he is blown to smithereens. His heart continues beating, but the coroner is hypnotized by it enough to devour Jason's heart and get it's evil powers. Therefore continuing the bloodshed of violence. \n\nThe motive for such a body snatcher flick is because, I think, to show Jason's supernatural origins. His super nature didn't get kicked into gear until Part 6, but here it's done to a much more interesting effect. In order for Jason to retake the form of what he once was he has to pass along his evil into a relative. Jason has a sister and a niece. Only through a Voorhees can Jason be reborn and with these victims continuing Jason's good work they try to find his sister and niece to be reborn! \n\nI kind of liked this installment. It has some great moments of gore and an overlong sex scene (if you watch the unrated version). Also the ending was a great way to introduce the inevitability of a cross over film between Jason and Freddy. Still not bad.",

Then \"Jason Goes to Hell\" goes to the discount bin. To paraphrase Woody Allen in regards to the movie it should be known that it, \"has a certain something that trumps logic, but proceed into the propeller,\" if one wants to brave it out further on down a long, incoherent narrative that somehow allows Jason to essentially shape-shift into other flesh-and-blood humans. Well, one can hope they are human, as the the lack of the slightest hints of character development hinder an already weak script inept. And it's no help that some characters were added with superfluous motive to be murdered. On the plus, there's more gore in \"Jason Goes to Hell\" than in a slaughterhouse as if to make up for its nonsensical existence as celluloid. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I saw \"Jason Goes to Hell\" in theatres I knew it wasn't going to be the last, so I had hope there would be a better, future sequel a few years later.

            "content": "Not only is Jason Goes to Hell my least favorite film in the series, it's also probably the worst overall. You would have thought that after the backlash of A New Beginning, wherein someone was pretending to be Jason, that they would have foregone the idea of Jason inhabiting the bodies of other people in order to survive, but no. They went with it anyway, and we had to suffer as a consequence. Instead of Jason being a supernatural serial killer just out for revenge against those who've wronged him, we learn that he's also an evil spirit. It reminds me a lot of the direction that the Halloween series went. After they had done all they could with the reality of each series, they had to get some unreality in there. The dialogue is gut-wrenchingly bad most of the time, so there's no room for creativity there. Some of the gore effects are pretty good, in particular the melting man scene (despite the scene not making much sense). The only really good scene in the film is the jail scene between the characters of Duke and John when Duke breaks John's fingers in order for him to \"pay\" for information about Jason. It's the moment when the film stops being schlock for a few minutes and actually pulls off something character-driven and interesting. It seems to have a nice build to it, and it's about the only really positive thing I can say about it. Everything surrounding it is garbage. The scene that really stuck out as not making any sense was when Jason (disguised as the coroner from earlier in the film) has a naked man strapped to a table and proceeds to shave him before the \"evil spirit\" leaves him and enters his body. While he's shaving him, the guy says \"What the hell are you doing?\", which is what I was wondering myself. Why exactly does Jason do this? What will it achieve? He's already in disguise as another person so why would making him look different be any help to him at all? And why does the guy melt into a pile of goop after Jason leaves his body for another? The guy wasn't dead or anything. He was just possessed, more or less. Other mistakes include the score for the film, which is absolutely terrible. I've never really objected to Harry Manfredini's score before, or cared that people accused him of blatantly ripping off the score from Psycho, but it stands out in this film as just needlessly appalling. It's basically a synthesizer-driven score that's trying to be epic in scale, but it just sounds like a MIDI file most of the time. It's not even laughable, it's just annoying. However, the biggest mistake that the filmmakers made was that in going with the storyline that Jason inhabits other people's bodies that Kane Hodder wasn't one of those bodies. Sure, he has a small cameo as a SWAT team guy who Jason murders off-camera, but it was a missed opportunity for people to see Hodder onscreen for once in this scenario. To be honest, I don't believe that the filmmakers thought that much about the actual content of the film while making it. They just showed up and did their jobs. There doesn't seem to be any passion or logic behind anything that's happening.",

His heart then seems to entrance the coroner into a state which causes him (the coroner) to consume the heart. This possesses the coroner with the soul of our irrepressible serial killer. Jason then proceeds to leap about various people, inhabiting each person then seemingly devouring them when he is ready to move on to the next. During this body-hopping he is chopping teens in half and pretty much doing the same thing that he has been doing since the franchise began, only this time it is substantially more graphic in its depiction of the kills. It's all just such mind-boggling nonsense, the likes of which I'm not sure I've seen before. The whole film is one profound mess from start to end, where incidentally New Line Cinema hint oh so subtly that Freddy vs Jason may well be in the works, in fact it took another ten years.",

Now in this movie, itâ(TM)s something about eating his heart and passing on a slug monster thatâ(TM)s his soul or something?  And then finding a Voorhes to bring back the true Jason?  Itâ(TM)s overly complicated, stupid, and how the hell did anyone find this out to explain it to us in the first place?  I donâ(TM)t need this much stupid backstory in Friday the 13th, just give me Jason!  And thatâ(TM)s another problem, because of all the body swapping, the true Jason is barely in this movie, he only gets maybe 5 or 10 minutes of screen time.  As a generic slasher with a weird-ass premise, I guess itâ(TM)s pretty good with a quick pace and solid kills.  But as a Friday the 13th, itâ(TM)s a disappointment.  One praiseworthy thing I will give it is the supporting cast, who are actually incredibly likable.  This whole town of people are full of personality, and I was actually worried when they were getting killed off.

Director Adam Marcus decided to take a different approach to the series and mix Friday the 13th with The Hidden (another New Line movie, coincidentally). In first couple of minutes, the SWAT team blows up Jason. Now that's how you start a movie! the entire middle part of the film does not feature Jason, but a demon worm that possesses people with the spirit of Jason by entering their mouths. After the worm is through, it causes the host's body to horrifically melt. Yeah, Jason Goes to Hell is probably the goriest of the series (if you watch it unrated). Due to the absence of Jason, this is hated by many people and I can't understand that. It's gory, funny, and full of references (the Necronomicon from the Evil Dead movies makes an appearance).

There might be a slightly different rating at the end.\r\n\r\nReally? From now on there will be 6 days in a week and 4 days in a school week???....Sweeeet.\r\n\r\nIn the opening scene, it not only re-captures the original suspense of the first, but also puts a new spin on it. Why is this so? Sean S. Cunningham. The creator of the original came to produce this film. No, he wasn't the director like the trailer says, he was producer. All I can say is, he must HAVE BEEN PISSED when they made Jason X. Unless he knew about the Freddy vs. Jason conspiracy, which we will DEFINABLY finally talk about. I've been wanting to unload this $#!T for so long on today's pop culture. (Yeah, I'm talking to you Jake.) But what am I doing about a film that was released...10 years later? Let's get on the review.\r\n\r\nJason's appearance is cool, and more freaky then the classic Jason, but is also kind of wrestler like. I don't care though, I like it. Just saying some of you might not like it. The appearance of Jason that is. Oh, and did I forget? Wasn't Part 8 the end of Jason? Well...this sort of ignores a good amount of Friday the 13th continuity for the sake of current story. And according to this, each film could have had a different...*SPOILERS* a different body for Jason, as well as even different bodies throughout one film. Although the second prospect is highly unlikely. *SPOILERS OVER.*\r\n\r\nThe people got really creative, I commend the script writers for breaking so many rules of Friday the 13th, and instead creating something completely new. Specifically, I'm talking about the close to opening scene where the dude eats Jason's heart. Crazy Bat $#!T. Also, because they broke enough rules, they were able to explain exactly what is Jason...and more. Much, much more is left to the brain. But more to talk about that later. Not to mention, the gore is friggin' sweet in this film. We got people cut in half (while having $3X may I add), we get people getting necks smashed in cars, it's all crazy fun. I sometimes wonder if I even should be watching this stuff though.\r\n\r\nNow, it's time for MOER SPANIARDS *gets slapped in the face by a Spanish English teacher.* Sorry. *SPOILERS...WELL NOT REALLY* There is a scene where the main character reads The Book of the Dead in the Voorhees house. Again: A MOVIE THAT HAS JASON, THE BOOK OF THE DEAD AND *gets slapped in the face by George Bush.* Hey, hey, I will say so later. *SPOILERS...WELL NOT REALLY OVER.* I'm getting slapped a lot today ain't I? The music is friggin sweet...that's just it. The music is sweet. I will say the only real negative is that the final feels very loosely written. While creative, it's not quite so tight. I suspect a college graduate with Aspergers wrote this...which I don't mind at all. It's awesome.\r\n\r\nSome scenes do repeat though. Which can make it someone boring. But who cares. The rest of the movie is awesome. It's like going through a dream, really. It's very surreal. (Don't all New Line Jason films feel like that?...In fact, don't most New Line films feel like that?) Now, time to talk about the ending. There is controversy surrounding it, and it is a double ending, but I think they pulled it off pretty well. Some aspects are distracting, but it's a very great climax for what the situation was up to that point. It was FREAKING AMAZING...for what they had to work with.\r\n\r\nBut now...it's time we talk about the Freddy vs. Jason conspiracy. I'm just gonna say right now, that I'm gonna give it a rating right here, and the rest will have spoilers. So, the rating? For a slasher film, it actually does fair decently. 3/5 in the slasher aspect. Storytelling is so awesome, 5/5. So it averages to 4/5 (same as Manhattan? Is there a reason?) \r\n\r\nTime for some history. The original was based off a book, I already told you that. Let's get to some facts.\r\n\r\n1981- Two films released that year are Friday the 13th: Part 2 (which was a cash grab to continue the series) and The Evil Dead.\r\n\r\n2007 through 2008 - The comic series of Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash is released.\r\n\r\n1984- Two films released that year are Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter and A Nightmare on Elm Street. This is interesting because it is the beginning of Freddy and the \"end\" of Jason.\r\n\r\n1985-Two films released that year are Friday the 13th: Part V: A New Beginning and A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's revenge. This is interesting because it is the \"vengeance\" of the main villain in each film. Also, 2 takes place five years after the first one, even though it was made just a year later. Same with Part 2 of Friday the 13th. \r\n\r\n1987 - A film released this year is A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors. It took an extra year to make this, as with the next film. Not to mention, Evil Dead II was released, the number resembles the number of years that did not have a FT13TH film in the 80's. Not to mention, on September 11th of this year, by NEW WORLD PICTURES, Hellrasier was released. (Compare to New Line Cinema and New World Order for 9/11.)\r\n\r\n1988 - Friday the 13th: Part VII: The New Blood. This film involves a psychic, and NOES 3 suggests people who can control dreams. (Though I haven't seen it.) Also, NOES has followed English/Arabic numbers so far. Then, ANOES Part 4: The Dream Warrior was released. Again suggesting a single person with special abilities to fight the villain. And again, Hellbound: Hellraiser II was released. Suggesting a single person as the subject this time.\r\n\r\nTwo years after Jason Takes Manhatten (1989) (the number of years that did not see a FT13TH film in the 80's) they release ANOES: Freddy's Dead which resembles Jason Takes Manhatten, and another film that would take the extra years to make 4 and 7...this film.\r\n\r\nIn 1992 Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth was released. This movie was in between the \"ending\" movies of the NOES and FT13TH franchises. Hell on Earth suggests the end of Earth. The tag line states \"What started in Hell ends on Earth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd whaddya know? At the end of this film, Freddy's hand comes out of Hell and grabs Jason's mask. Also, Army of Darkness was released the same year, ending the Evil Dead series.\r\n\r\n1996- Hellraiser IV: Bloodline was released. The last Hellraiser movie released in theaters. The end of the theatrical Hellraiser films in other words. This was 3 years after Jason Goes to Hell and 5 after Freddy's Dead, the number of movies that were in the Hellraiser series before and after the movie was released.\r\n\r\n2000-Hellraiser: Inferno was released. It was the first film to be released strait to video for Hellraiser, and in the first year of the millennium. \r\n\r\n2002-Jason X and Hellraiser: Hellseeker was released. This will be discussed in the Jason X review.\r\n\r\nSee any parrallels? This will be discussed more another day.\r\n\r\nI, Da Ca$hman signing off.",

            "content": "I'll say this first: this movie could've worked as its own film in a supernatural thriller form. Yea, it rips off XTRO and The Thing blatantly, but I may have been able to find some mild enjoyment out of all it. The gore and practical effects are pretty good and all, so its got some value. It still wouldn't be good, but seriously, cut anything involving Jason Voorhees out and make it a completely plot, and I'd maybe JUST maybe think of it in a better light.\n\nBUT, this was made as a Friday The 13th sequel, so I have to review it that way. That being said... this blows. Yep, it's the very fact this is apart of this series that kills it. I said what I said about this movie being a separate movie because this is barely a proper Jason Voorhees films at all. He's in it at the beginning and end, and that's it. A lot of stuff in it just doesn't make any sense, and I'm not sure they really cared. The whole cause of the \"supernatural possession\" shit doesn't make sense. The doctor eats Jason's heart, and begins the chaos. Why movie!? WHY!? And the rest of the movie is hard to care about because it lacks the spirit of the series. We want to see Jason, not regular humans turned possessed killers. Even the parts with Jason Voorhees don't do anything. He's shot by SWAT at the beginning, which is one of those \"Hey that sounds cool!\" ideas... until you realize, he's been shot many times before, and usually doesn't die that easily. And the ending is some supernatural drag me to hell shit, and if that's not cool enough, Freddy Krueger makes his cameo with his arm reaching out of the ground! HA! Fuck you movie. \n\nEven if I did see potential for this movie to work somewhat re-edited as its own supernatural thriller, that's not the movie that was made,  I can only carry that by imagining what could've been. But for what we got, I can at least thank it for something: it helped me to appreciate A New Beginning a little bit more! Between these two movies which I consider the bottom two, Jason Goes To Hell at least take the cake in gore and murder scenes which the 5th lacked form heavy censorship, but the 5th movie was a better plot and a more proper Friday movie. I'm not sure how to rank this movie, as I enjoyed it all for the thing it was not, yet extremely dislike it for what it was supposed to be. It's a piss poor Friday sequel, but a fairly okay supernatural thriller, how about that?",

Part 8 had disappointing box-office returns so paramount decided to flog the dying series to New Line. Straight from the off it's hugely evident that a switch has taken place because Jason Goes to Hell doesn't even remotely resemble any of the previous installments. You have to give New Line credit for trying to revive the series but it's a poor film and it's easy to see why there was an 8 year gap until the next one.\n\nThe plot is bat shit crazy, how they thought this would be a good idea is beyond me, firstly they seem to completely disregard the ending of part 8 as if it never happened. Instead we pick up with Jason terrorising a woman at Crystal Lake. She escapes and he follows her only to be led into a trap involving the military who blow him to smithereens. It seems that after 86 killings that the military decided enough is enough. I couldn't stop laughing at this opening but it gets much worse. Jason's body parts are shipped to a morgue. While doing the autopsy Jason's above average size heart begins to beat so, as you do, the doctor begins to eat the heart. It turns out that Jason is not really a human but a supernatural spirit that lives in his heart. He has the ability to jump from body to body (which he does numerous times) by this weird giant tongue thing. The only way he can be killed is for one of the last two surviving member of the Voorhees family to stab him in the heart with a special knife. If Jason manages to get inside the body of one of the Voorhees he will be reborn again with a new body.\n\nAs I said the plot is ridiculous. Jason has about 4 minutes of screen time in the entire film because he spends most of it jumping from body to body. I have to admit that the effects were very good, particularly one scene of a melting body, and the film is by far the goriest of the series. One kill scene in a tent is very gruesome. If they had stuck to the tried and tested storylines of the series it could have been great with the added gore and effects but alas they chose to make a horror film that was Friday the 13th by name only. The acting is pretty solid throughout but the score is very annoying as it's way too cheesy. It just never feels like a Friday the 13th film and it's obvious that you are watching the death of the series.\n\nThe film does manage to be entertaining b providing plenty of unintentional laughs and the gore and kill scenes are good. Sadly the fact that Jason has become and walking heart that can jump from body to body just makes it all too silly. Famous for it's ending though which indicated things to come.\n\nWatch it for a laugh and it's still better than part 8.",

            "content": "What do you do with a series of movies that has survived audience apathy and critical wrath long enough to reach the number nine? Here's a mass murderer that has already gone 3D, gone missing to make way for an impostor, returned only to be killed and resurrected and transformed into a zombie, waged war with telekinetic teens, taken Manhattan, and basically done the same thing in every movie only with a new gimmick to drive the microscopic plot and hoped-for ticket sales. Normally I'd expect them to go to outer space (oh, just wait), but instead the masters of the Friday the 13th franchise decided at this juncture between numbers eight and ten - they go to space in that one - to make a movie called Jason Goes to Hell, and it says something for a series where such a title won't get someone fired. By the time James Bond hit number nine, it could have been called Bond Goes to Hell, but the producers of that eclectic series decided to call it The Man With the Golden Gun instead, and I'll just let you decide which of those two titles is more appropriate.\r\n\r\nI'll give the makers of Jason Goes to Hell this: they certainly didn't want to repeat themselves. Or anyone else for that matter. Making a Jason movie without Jason in it must've felt like a bold move at the time, and I loved it when I was 13. It took a couple of years, but eventually my maturing self eventually noticed the pot haze and Cheeto dust that must have led to its creation, and the whole hilarity of how such an unbelievably stupefying movie got into theatres began to fill me with incredulous delight. \r\n\r\nThey just don't make 'em like they used to.\r\n\r\nJason Goes to Hell opens like any other movie in the series, with a buxom young woman driving out to a cabin in the middle of the woods to take her clothes off. I swear, if there were half as many nude women in actual forests as there are in these movies, we wouldn't be able to drag teenage boys out of the woods with a chain tied to a tank. But I digress. The clothes come off, Jason comes on. Substituting a machete for male anatomy, Jason goes for a different type of penetration when he is rudely accosted and blown to bits by the FBI. I suppose that's one way to open a movie. We go from slinky undressing to FBI grenade chucking in less than five minutes. \r\n\r\nIt's not usual for title characters to get eviscerated before the opening credits, but in the annals of slasher celluloid, Jason Goes to Hell is something of an avant-garde production. For instance, Jason, having been deprived of his fleshy self, is now a demon-spirit-gremlin-thingy that jumps around from body to body, implanting himself via a giant tongue swap with a new host. The body-swapping is the movie's primary gimmick, forcing several unmasked actors to ask themselves 'What would Jason do?' He probably would not be in a movie where he couldn't be seen but fear not, horror fiends, for the customary bad acting and mandatory atrocious writing that made the series famous remain perfectly intact.\r\n\r\nIt's a family affair as the story follows Jason's sister Diana (Erin Gray), and his niece Jessica (Kari Keegan) as they are both targets of interest for two different men. One of them is Jessica's nerdy ex husband Steven (John D. LeMay), who is trying to figure out what is going on and reunite with his newborn baby, while the other is a bounty hunter named Creighton Duke (Steven Williams) who knows Jason is still alive and brandishes a magical blade that must be used by one of Jason's bloodline to kill him once and for all. Now, go back and read that sentence again and tell me why these two characters are in the same movie and, more importantly, why the estranged husband is the one who gets to become the main protagonist. Everyone is singularly awful in these various roles, but it's not the actors who deserve scorn. Anthony Hopkins possessed by Lawrence Olivier couldn't make this dialogue palatable:\r\n\r\n\"From a Voorhees was he born, and through a Voorhees can he be reborn, and only by the hands of a Voorhees will he die.\"\r\n\r\nOr they could've just kept talking and killed him with prepositions.\r\n\r\nAnyway, acting-schmacting. How's the killing? It pleases me to report that the gore is present and accounted for and flows forth like raspberry rain, lubricating the proceedings with sometimes-spectacular results. What can one say about a softcore sex scene where the girl is brutally impaled with a tent spike and vertically ripped in half mid-coitus? The scene still shocks, no matter how many times I see it.  There's always a lift in a movie whever it reaches a certain level. And let's not forget the scene where a professionally trained actor has to pick up a rubber heart filled with goo and pretend to violently eat it, goo running all over the place with more than a few streaks of dignity smacking the floor with it. There are other impalements. One man gets his forearm snapped in half. Another in a diner gets his face shoved in a pool of boiling hot grease, and it is to my eternal disappointment that Jason didn't look directly at the camera and ask if we'd like fries with that. \r\n\r\nThis is a silly review for a silly movie. I have never understood critics who get angry at these bad horror movies. With a title like Jason Goes to Hell, what exactly are they expecting? These movies are just too goofy to offend. There is a willful immaturity on display here, and there is something kind of charming about that. Don't get me wrong though - this is a terrible movie. To quote Ebert (as I tend to do) it is \"unusually bad\". Truly awful. And I'd also like point out that this movie has the worst musical score I have ever heard in a film, and I'm counting zero-budget MST crapola like Pod People into that assessment. But, having said all that, I just can't get mad at it the way I am supposed to. It is pretentious, disingenuous drivel such as The Exorcism of Emily Rose that harvests my wrath.  You have to choose your battles, I guess. Nonetheless, I'll do my duty and tell you that Jason Goes to Hell is tacky, gory, absurd, nonsensical, cheap, eye-rollingly stupid, and easily one of the worst in an already spotty series of films that began with a shameless rip-off of Halloween. And now that I've done that, just be aware that there's a smile on my face right now.\r\n\r\nSCORE: 3 / 10",

            "content": "In all honesty, I really don't know where to begin with \"Jason Goes to Hell.\"  You've got to hand it to any movie that has the balls to actively and frequently take everything that the series had been known for up until this point and do a complete 180, but at some level, the \"Friday the 13th\" formula was fine just the way it was.  It lived and died in the '80s, at least according to this reporter.  It was just fine being a cheesy remnant of that glorious decade, and nothing less than the sum of all slasher parts.  Or something.  I at least TRY to make my paragraphs look long so that readers think that they may be substantive on some level.  Since many of you are probably just glossing over this review anyway, I enjoy hardcore porn and your mother frequently has a starring role in them.  What?\n\nWell, I'm sure that you're all just begging to know how the F13 series passed from the slasher-riffic '80s in the ironic '90s, but the truth is...well, the only truth I know is that Paramount let the series go and New Line Cinema, also the owners of a certain razor-gloved serial killer franchise, picked it up.  A four-year gap in movies occurred between this flick and its predecessor, \"Friday the 13th Part VIII,\" leaving a lot of fans of the series to wonder if Jason had indeed been drowned for good at the climax of that particular movie.  Alas, it was not to be.  He WAS resurrected twice more in \"official\" sequels to the Paramount series, although pidgeonholing these movies into the \"Friday the 13th\" chronology (which is so confounding that it really requires its own separate set of essays) is some kind of unenviable task.  \n\nThis movie was overseen, once again, by Sean S. Cunningham, the man responsible for bringing F13 to the world in the first place.  In a Vince Russo-esque twist, he came back to the series with the same high-minded and elitist viewpoint that many directors seem to have when one of their movies turns into the long-winded horror franchise.  Namely, he looked down on it.  The flick was written and directed by a newcomer named Adam Marcus, freshly graduated from film school, and Cunningham's only instruction to Marcus was to \"get Jason the hell out of that hockey mask.\"  Regardless of everything else that happens in this movie, yes, Marcus did indeed deliver on that part of the job description.\n\nEgads, this is some weird movie.  At the time, it WAS intended as the final, end-all denounment of the series; the movies had already seen a \"Final Chapter\" and a four-year gap between sequels, so props to the creators for the title on this one.  Indeed, it was powerful enough that his next resurrection wouldn't come for nine years this time.  In this one, however, we don't get Jason Voorhees as we know and love him.  Rather, we get Jason Voorhees in the form of a coroner, a police officer, and a whole host of other nonsensical characters.  Basically, \"Jason Goes to Hell\" is \"Friday the 13th\" meets \"The Hidden.\"  Or at least that's what they tell me.  I've never seen \"The Hidden,\" but I hate this movie, so I'm allowed to quote anonymous movie-based forum posters in their derision of this flick, right?  In addition to that, it's got a whole bunch of nonsensical and downright hilarious stuff happening within its bite-sized 100-or-so-minute running time, so allow me to recap.\n\nThe movie at least gets points for its opening.  Typical \"Friday the 13th\" hot counselor-type hangs out at a decidedly Crystal Lake-y campsite for a while before being attacked by Jason, the man.  She runs in typical horror heroine fashion, but in reality, that panic is all there for a purpose, baby.  She lures Jason out into a clearing in the forest, at which point approximately 50,000 armed soldiers open fire on the poor guy and blow him to smithereens.  We just met an FBI agent posing as your typical F13 siren, so get used to some of the baffling switcheroos that this movie pulls on you.\n\nThe remains of Jason (I can't believe I just typed those four words) get taken to a nearby morgue, where KANE HODDER IN NON-JASON FORM is one of the FBI guards.  And what happens here?  Why - the most logical thing, of course, as the AFOREMENTIONED coroner gets possessed by the evil spirit of Jason and goes on a kill-crazy rampage, eventually heading back toward Crystal Lake itself in search of his long-lost cousin, whom he must kill in order to preserve his reign of terror forever.  Lots of s**ts and giggles all around, I tells ya.\n\nTo say that this was a jarring switch for diehard F13 fans is the understatement of the century.  I have no problem with film-makers taking an established entertainment venue in a new direction, but come on, guys, this is Jason Freakin' Voorhees we're talking about.  Not only did they take the hockey mask out of the beloved series, they even took Kane Hodder out of the series with the exception of the introductory and closing scenes.  When you've got the absolute BEST guy who's ever played your iconic role in your movie, a guy who not only brings a fresh portrayal to the silent role but is a huge fan of the character's lore and history as well, you use him.  With much due respect to the guy who created my favorite horror series, Mr. Cunningham, WHAT were you thinking?\n\nWhat other vital, important pieces of movie history are there to tell you about?  Oh, right - the horror aspect of this horror movie.  To be sure, there's plenty of murder fodder found within \"JGTH.\"  But the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of what goegs on in this flick is just downright BORING.  The \"Friday the 13th\" films were many things before this movie came out, but boring was never among them.  This movie is an experiment in controlled tedium, in which a whole slew of secondary characters that aren't even interesting enough to get an official secondary character rolodex get trotted out before us.  Well, except for the police officer who gets shaved by Coroner-Jason in perhaps the most homoerotic scene in motion picture history.  That's a very...interesting scene.\n\nOur hero characters in this go-round are something else, as well.  There's Creighton Duke, played by Steven \"Mr. X\" Williams, a bounty hunter on the trail of Mr. J who gives us the classic line \"you could have had the Duker!\"  Williams has always been a favorite of mine, in everything from \"Twilight Zone: The Movie\" to \"Blues Brothers\" to \"X-Files,\" and here he's just as charismatic.  Virtually the only guy in the entire movie who doesn't just phone it on, he steals every scene that he's in.  \n\nUnfortunately, none of the other characters are even worth mentioning - including our main protagonist and antagonist.  Surprisingly, I found myself incredibly apathetic to the story presented in this movie.  I understand that many people don't watch these flicks for the story, and at a base level I don't either; however, I do expect at least some sort of investment in a slasher flick, and sadly the only investment I had with \"JGTH\" was when Steven Williams would turn up on screen again to take me away from the Land of Tedium (just a door over from the Land of the Lost - bah dum bah).  That can really sum up the whole movie - it's got moments of brief loudness that interrupt us from the boring, one-note stuff happening onscreen that do little more than lull us out of our stupors.  It really does little more than just reinforce my opinion that \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" should have been the final movie in the series.  \"Friday the 13th\" lived in the '80s, and in the mind of the Horror Nerd, died there as well.",

If they hadn't tried to give Jason this supernatural explanation and had something else in its place, this would have been a lot better.

He was generally silent up until this film and is again in Jason X. So...what the hell? It's a disappointing sendoff overall for a film labeled as The Final Friday.

Jason looked great here, suggesting the damages that he has gone through. The deaths are original and sometimes even funny, and the ending is purely made for horror fans to scream for excitement. \"Jason goes to Hell\" is a joy to watch, and the rating must not detract viewers to see it.

Rather than being an unstoppable killing machine, he is now a supernatural being who is able to bodyhop via some large wierd slugs, which explains his longevity through this series. So throughout this film, we see Jason switching bodies each time his old one gets a little stabbed/shot/impaled. Kane Hodder once again portrays Jason, his huge bulk and physicality put to good use, and there's plenty of gore (a girl gets torn in half mid-sexual intercourse!) to enjoy. But you can see that the series was running out of steam and ideas by this point, and despite nice cameos from the Necomicon from The Evil Dead and Freddy Krueger's gloved hand (which eventually lead to Freddy Vs Jason), there isn't a whole lot in Jason Goes to Hell worth recommending.",

Suddenly her bath is interrupted by a power outage and an machete wielding psychopath in a hockey mask known as Jason Voorhees. \n\nThe young woman turned out to be bait for a SWAT team. They needed him out in the open so they could shoot and blow him up. It's a success with a flaw: Jason's heart stops beating momentarily until at the morgue where it begins to beat again.\n\nA man examining the heart becomes possessed (or forced) to eat it once it starts beating again. He devours the heart to gain the power of Voorhees himself. With this power comes a great killing ability. Now Jason has returned in a more body snatchers type of fashion. The only one who appears to stop him is a man named Creighton Duke, a black version of Quint from 'Jaws'.\n\nAccording to Duke, the only way Jason can return to hell is if one of his relatives stab him in the chest with a special dagger. Sounds easy enough, but when those that are possessed by him aren't wearing his trade mark hockey mask it can get very confusing. \n\nFor the characters that are stuck in this body snatcher situation could only be the most positive thing for them. Seeing Jason in all his grotesque glory would easily sending them running for the hills. That is unless he possesses one of his dead relatives than you might as well prepare for a quick death as he can only return to human form  through this act alone.\n\nThe daughter of a Voorhees, Jessica, is going to have to be stuck with the burden of taking care of this matter. Well, her, Steven with the glasses and Duke. Hooray! \n\nThe early ninties called for the end of our usual eighties slasher figures. It would begin with Krueger in Freddy's Dead before we would get a \"farewell\" from good ol' Jason here. Such crap. EVIL NEVER DIES! or so they say.\n\nThis \"final friday\" has an interesting set-up with Jason supernaturally jumping from one body to the next. It's not interesting, however, to see other people doing Jason's deeds without that damn hockey mask! It's a joke that we have to endure a load of crap until we FINALLY see him in the last half of the film. It's worth it to stay put until then, but that doesn't mean much either way.\n\nOverall, a very disappointing \"end\".",

The masked maniac is a demon parasite in search of a family member so that he can become his old self again. It's all a bit goofy and there are some unintentional funnies but who cares. The movie is fantastically gory and overly entertaining. Not only does it have the best kills of the series but also has the best kill of any slasher ever.

LeMay, Keri Keegan, Steven Williams, Steven Culp, Erin Gray, Rusty Schwimmer, Richard Gant, Andrew Bloch\n\nIn the ninth installment of the popular gore fest, Jason goes airborne and is suddenly capable of infecting others with a mangy virus and taking over their bodies in order to kill.\n\nThe film opens with a dodgy FBI operation  where Jason (Hodder)  is pulled  into a trap with a slinky undercover agent who lures  him into showing up at the cabin with her slick, sexy shower tricks.  Jason is essentially obliterated and his body parts are gathered up and taken to the morgue where his crusty beating heart is eaten by the coroner (Gant).  Jason enters the coroners body and the mayhem begins.\n\nThere is much carnage including a trio of randy kids out for some kicks at Camp Crystal Lake.  Jason returns and quickly eliminates them before we hardly get their names.  Still, as is always the case, its never a good idea to have sex anywhere near Crystal Lake because Jason abhors intimacy and must annihilate it at every turn.\n\nThe film explores new lunacy in the Jason mythos.  We discover that he has a half-sister named Diane Kimble (Gray) and that he can only be killed with a magic dagger by one of his female kin.  That leaves Diane, her daughter Jessica (Keegan) and Jessicas daughter Stephanie.  The film gets really wacky in the end as the great climax comes to a close.  There are elements of Aliens that just dont seem to work here.  Its comical rather than being dramatically effective.  \n\nJason infects his targets by transferring a thick black ooze into their throats.  Apparently this act replaces their hearts and he takes over operations from there.  In one scene Jason  actually kidnaps a policeman named Josh (Bloch) and straps him to a table before replacing his heart.  From here there are many more deaths including that of Diane which is blamed on Steven (LeMay), Jessicas former boyfriend and father of her child.\n\nThe story is fairly convoluted and includes a Crime show host named Robert (Culp) who decides to jazz his line up a bit by stealing Dianes corpse and filming a show at the old Voorhees place.  Of course he becomes the next empty shell killer when Josh does the whole ooze transfer on him. He too murders many people and naturally there are complications with Jessica.\n\nSo, this story has some interesting, if not wholly original ideas to play around with.  Having Jason possess the ability to take up a new body when the old one is a bit creaky is fairly well-heeled territory.  The film doesnt do anything novel with the premise and we are actually left with a slimy black creature that comes out of Jasons mouth looking for a way to be born.  He finds a way and its the most interesting aspect of the film.  The visual repercussions of the scene resonate long after the film is over. \n\nSteven is the main mail protagonist in this film as he gets himself caught square up in the middle of the killing spree by merely being in he wrong place at the wrong time.  Hes somewhat ineffectual but he can take and throw a punch.  Still, hes lacking in a discernible personality which drags the film down considerably whenever hes on screen.  Hes paired up with yet another charisma-lite female character who is supposed to force audiences into caring but we dont care for her and we certainly could care less about her damn baby.  I think it would have been a find idea to have Jason possess the baby and make her into a killer of other babies in playpens and such.   It would be cool to have her smothering all the fat little babies in the neighborhood when their mothers come over to knit. \n\nJason Voorhees hardly makes an appearance here as himself.  He fills the bodies of at least four  men and we are given the succinct privilege of watching them hack their way to orgasmic oblivion.  Admittedly, its just not the same as when Jason does it in his own flesh.  His body, gnarled and rotten, adds a certain grittiness to his killing sprees which is completely lost in the new versions.   It seems like a decent idea but the application is all wrong and the end result is essentially disappointment that this could have been something potentially more unnerving and toxic.  Instead, its just silliness from beginning to end; once the final scenes commence  you know you are in the place where interesting scenarios  go to die.  These ideas were not properly thought out and leave the viewer in a state of acute perplexity.  \n\nThe film features a bounty hunter named Creighton Duke (Williams) who apparently is the only one who knows how to stop Jason.  At the beginning of the film he offers his services to a TV station for $500,000 and they accept.  All he has at his disposal is one tiny bit of information that he has culled from some source or another.  Thats all he has although it does turn out to be a very valuable piece of info.  Its just not worth the money he demands from his potential client.  So, he stands on the sidelines as Jessica goes about doing her business with the magic dagger.  We know its magic because green light surrounds it when she picks it up.  This also occurs whenever Jason transplants his heart into another body.  Its corny and turns the film into something completely outside the realm populated by the earlier films in the series.\n                    \nOverall, the film isnt as scary as it ought to be.  The premise is fairly sound and there are plenty of opportunities to create a brutal, uncompromising film experience but it just never quite turns out that way.  Its comical in a way that the film makers most likely never intended although the men who are the recipients of Jasons heart look like proper zombies with their mouths caked in blood and their frenetic killing styles.  Ultimately, there is nothing in this film that requires Jasons presence whatsoever.  It could have been made with an entirely different character.  Its a Friday the 13th film without its star player and the result is entirely underwhelming.",

This is the worst entry in the series.  'Jason Goes to Hell' has probably escaped my wrath because I have done such a great job avoiding it.  The basic idea behind the story rips off the 1989 Wes Craven flick 'Shocker' by having the spirit of Jason jump from body to body. Didn't people learn something by not having Jason in 'A New Beginning'?  Jason is in the film, but his true appearances are few and far between. The film also borrows from 'Halloween 2' and 'The Evil Dead' while throwing nods to 'Creepshow' and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'.  I will give New Line props for releasing this in an unrated DVD, but the movie is just so bad it is hard to enjoy the extra footage.  I do remember being excited after seeing the very last scene in the movie, but had to wait a decade for the payoff.",

I was absolutely horrifed and angered that they tried to pass this off as one of the Friday the 13th movies. Jason X and Jason 8 was much better than this.
