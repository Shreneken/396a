The 3 \"heroes\" decide to follow western traditions and go on a \"bachelor's party\" trip to celebrate the groom's upcoming marriage, then criticize the bride to no end for caring about her relationship and the groom and eventually cause the groom to break up and walk away from the relationship - over no substantial grounds (like cheating, abuse, etc.) only because the groom was too shy to actually speak up when everyone thought he was proposing! \n\nThe only female character that is praised is Katrina Khaif because she is \"pretty\" and \"chill\" - are we still in high school or are these men in their 30's? Yet another \"hero\" uses his father abandoning him as an excuse to mistreat other women and having a string of failed relationships including a one-night stand with a girl he meets on the trip - hey, but at least he burdens her with his deepest thoughts for 1 night. \n\nThe whole movie reminded me of how Donald Trump said his comments on women were just \"locker-room talk\". The whole movie is such an insult to men and their friendships!",

            "content": "If you're looking for a feel-good film that will leave you inspired to seize the day with a smile on your face, look no further. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara follows three college friends, now young professionals, on their bachelor holiday and adventures through Spain. I came in expecting a slightly different iteration of The Hangover, but was happily surprised by the poignancy of this film. Of course, as a buddy film, it includes a healthy serving of sexual innuendo, practical jokes, and general lightheartedness. However, serious issues like confronting an absentee father, admitting that it's not the right time for marriage, and balancing work with life are also tackled. \n\nZindagi Na Milegi Dobara appealed to me on many levels. The subtleties of the interactions between Kabir, Imraan, and Arjun are charming to watch, but also incredibly realistic and relatable. This allowed me to feel as if the story could be about me and my friends. None of the characters are perfect; all of them have at least one fairly major flaw. Again, I think this makes the film more approachable; depicting the characters as being just like the viewer, rather than idealized caricatures. Beyond this, the locations and sets were incredibly aesthetically pleasing, taking the viewer under the sea, through the air in a free-fall, along the rural roads of Spain, and all sorts of places in between. Overall, the film was very enjoyable.\n\nWhile the buddy story was lots of fun to watch, the film was not perfect. My biggest problem was the portrayal of women in this film. In 2002, Rachel Dwyer and Divia Patel wrote about the female character types in Bollywood: historically, either an idealized matriarch, or a promiscuous vamp who has lost her morality. They explain that in the 1990s, Bollywood started shifting away from these tropes, with the typical, middle-class, westernized-but-not-Western woman asserting her dominance. The two main female characters, Natasha and Laila, certainly fit into this category. However, as are so many women in male-dominated comedies, they are both woefully one-sided and underdeveloped. Natasha, Kabir's fianc\u00e9e, exists solely to nag, manipulate, and take the fun out of every situation. Laila is young, free, and beautiful, and experiences no character growth or challenges throughout the film. It's hard not to contrast these unrealistic women with a character like Radha from Mother India. We see Radha as a happy newlywed who transitions into a hardworking and loyal wife, into a determined single mother, into the image of absolute strength. While it's nice that Natasha and Laila can wear short dresses without being shamed, is this liberation really progress for female characters? It seems as if the strength that used to be valorized in the Bollywood woman has all but disappeared. \n\nWhen all is said and done, this film accomplishes the task of providing entertainment in a easy to comprehend way. While not perfect, I would certainly watch it again- after I convince my friends to skydive with me!",

            "content": "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara follows three young men: Kabir, Imran, and Arjun, as they reconnect and discover themselves on a bachelors' trip through Spain. The film can be loosely categorized as a member \"Lost and Found\" Bollywood genre, as defined by Tejaswini Ganti. In keeping with the conventions of the genre, the young men, who were childhood friends, have become separated from one another, only to happily reunite at the story's conclusion. The film parallels the quintessential \"Lost and Found\" Bollywood film, Amar, Akbar, Anthony, in which three brothers become separated in youth, only to be brought back together as young men. Amar, Akbar, Anthony's plot plays out as an epic melodrama, but Zindagi's story is far subtler. Rather than being torn apart by nefarious villains or fateful coincidences, Kabir, Imran, and Arjun are estranged for more mundane reasons, such as diverging career paths and residing in different countries. Their conflict is solved by emotionally reconnecting, not by realizing their blood kinship. In fact Zindagi has no reconciliation between blood and fictive kinships. Not only are the main characters just friends, but Imran's meeting with his biological father proves to be a disappointment. This is in contrast to Amar, Akbar, and Anthony's fictive kinships, which cleanly align with their discovered blood kinships. Instead Kabir, Imran and Arjun find solace in friendship, and do need a complete family structure in order to be happy. \n\nAll in all, Zindagi tells a satisfying story, but it is far from perfect. Each of the leads grows over the course of the narrative: Kabir rethinks his relationship with his fianc\u00e9, Imran meets his biological father and decides to become a poet, and Arjun relaxes from from job and falls in love. Highlights include the scuba diving, tomato fight, skydiving and running of the bulls scenes. These were by far the best spectacles of the film, which is a road trip movie. However, I felt that their was dead time in the middle of the movie, a lot of shots of sitting around hotels and riding in cars that felt superfluous. Additionally, the gear shifts between the three character arcs can be jarring, feeling like two of the leads have the emotional pause button on while the third one gets the chance to grow. I feel no urge to rewatch this movie. If you like feel-good buddy movies, then this is the film for you.",

            "content": "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is a reminder to live life to the fullest. In this movie three college friends Kabir (Abhay Deol), Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), and Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) travel through Spain for Kabir's bachelor trip. Along the way they check off \"bucket list\" items including skydiving. They also befriend scuba instructor Laila (Katrina Kaif); however, Kabir's fianc\u00e9e, Natasha (Kalki Koechlin), is not too thrilled when she hears about their new companion. While the friends set off to Spain for a seemingly simple bachelor party, little did they know that confrontations with the past would send them each on a true journey to happiness. \nZindagi Na Milegi Dobara plays on the Bollywood \"lost and found\" formula. In movies such as Amar, Akbar, Anthony, the \"lost and found\" structure is taken literally when the brothers (and parents) do not recognize each other or know they are related and must physically find each one another. Meanwhile, in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the \"lost and found\" plot is based on emotional estrangement as three friends, separated by past wounds and differing lifestyles, must come back together to rediscover their old selves, both as individuals and as the \"Three Musketeers.\" Although Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara begins with the emotional separation of friendships, and Amar, Akbar, Anthony centers around misrecognition of blood-family, both movies follow the characters as they try to find their way (either emotionally or physically) home.   \nI was slightly disappointed that aside from \"Seniorita,\" K3G-level song sequences with playback singing, giant crowds dancing, and colorful costumes were limited. It seems that this movie tried to integrate the music in a Hollywood rather than Bollywood style. For instance, instead of a traditional song-dance sequence between Laila and Arjun, their relationship develops through an underwater instrumental interlude while scuba-diving. Nevertheless, we do find a more traditional song moment as Arjun later sings in the back of the car love-struck over his feelings towards Laila. As mentioned by Sangita Gopal and Biswarup Sen, this moment \"facilitates the process of individuation and the creation of a private self through the mechanism of romantic love and yearning\" (Gopal and Sen, \"Inside and out: song and dance in Bollywood cinema\") as Arjun's love becomes clear. \nEnding on a positive note, I will say my favorite musical moment is tied between Arjun and Kabir singing about \"Diamond Biscuits\" and all three grown men singing \"I'm a rock chick in a hot rock world.\"",

There is tension between characters, as well as secrets. The movie (crappily ranslated as \"One Life to Live,\" or roughly translated as, \"You won't get a second life.\") is both humorous and insightful, and the friendship between the three leads is completely believable. \n\nThe movie runs on the long side and the musical interludes could be edited down, but I understand that for some people, the song and dance add to the movie's charm. The actors who portray the three best friends are triple threats who can sing, act and dance. The Tomatina Festival scenes is one of the most memorable musical montages ever. \n\nIf you are new to the Bollywood genre, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is the perfect introductory movie with its nice blend of drama, humor and action.",

Then, Kabir, along with his school- buddies Arjun (Hrithik) and Farhan (Imran) set off for a trip (after some hiccups), where they all would participate in adventure sports of choice of each one of them. The trip gradually portrays various aspects of each of the character. Along with the adventure sports, all of which are greatly shown, the humor is very subtle and nice. \n\nPerformance of the lead actors is engaging. Farhan Akhtar as Imran is the more lovable one, with most of the funny one-liners, than his friends. He manages to pull off an entertaining performance. Abhay Deol, as always, is very good as the leader of the pack. He portrayed his dilemma regarding his marriage in a very convincing manner. Hrithik's character has more dark shades than the others, and it was his brilliance that made the character's transformation look enthralling. Amongst the ladies, Kalki is great as the overbearing and possessive fianc\u00c3 (C)e. Katrina looks and also acts well whenever she plays a NRI character. Much like herself. \n\nThe movie's cinematography is excellent and the music along with the songs and poetry are a treat to ears.",

The ensemble cast of Hrithik, Abhay & Farhaan excels, Katrina was at her natural best. Supporting cast did full justice as well. Strong history and sporting culture of Spain enhances the script.

The first 45 minuted are one of a kind ever seen. No not talking about any action sequence but the whole taang khicho act by the trio. Hrithik has always been my favourite but everybody seems to put up a flawless performance. The whole screen play and locales are awestrucking! But then the usual catastrophe of Indian Cinema- Love Love Love! Wtf dude! It was going smooth. And the movie after reaching the peak starts sliding and never again lifts up. It was a thus decent watch. Not a good or a very good watch in terms of the overality.",

Yeah, \"boy was I surprised\" part in the previous sentence ain't true. As expected, ZNMD turned out to be a run-of-the-mill friendship saga which had a handful of favorable moments. Except for the beauty of Spain, the package hardly consists of anything worthwhile. The best thing about the movie is the casting of protagonists (Abhay, Hrithik, Farhan, Kaitrina, Kalki). They perform well enough in this film which has an apology for a script. Worst is the emotional quotient. Although it doesn't occupy much of the runtime, they're thrown in. Probably, they ran out of options for fillers. The sequences which were supposed to stir up emotions & moisten my eyes were terribly written. None of them were remotely touching, let alone moistening my eyes. There's a sort of mystery woven w.r.t. Imraan's father, but when it's unveiled, it lacked the punch I was expecting. And a small surprise thrown in towards the ending, while surprised me, didn't make the movie any more effective. I felt as if the writer had pulled off random events, some good, some bad, from here & there and assembled it into the script anyhow. What a messy journey!!! It's surely not the worst I've seen till date, but I don't find it any recommendable.",

I just thought how much fun I have missed (and possibly can have) while watching this. The three adventure choices are AWESOME especially the race with raging bulls!!! Though I couldn't see any SUPERB acting from anyone, still they are all okay. The places where they make fun at people are cool. Katrina is cuuuuuteeee and the scene where she chases Hritik in a bike for a kiss is so romantic!!!!\n\nFirst of all I felt like I am watching a Hindi version of THE HANGOVER at some places. Both movies have the fun-of-bachelor-party concept though both travel in different directions. Definitely a must-watch-entertainment-movie.\n\nFavorite Quotes : \n\"A man should be in a box when he is dead\".\n\"Every moment can be a new life. Why do you let them pass by?\"\n\"Seize the day to it's fullest my friend. Then think about 40. How do you know you will be alive till then?\"",

            "content": "Inspirational Mediocrity\n\nZoya Akhtar's second outing is unfortunately not as great as her debut film, Luck By Chance. With a strong cast, stunning locales of Spain and impressive music the public's expectations were high; though the theme never quite intrigued me.\n\nKabir (Abhay Deol) is about to get married to brat Natasha (Kalki Koechlin); his last wish before tying the knot is to go on a holiday with his two childhood friends, Arjun (Hrithik Roshan) and Imraan (Farhan Akhtar). While superficially it seems like a simple bachelor holiday, the reason each of them is coming on this trip is what the film is truly about as the three bachelors harbor a secret. Each of the friends has picked one particular location they want to go to on this holiday and one adventurous activity they want to do. The three characters meeting for the first time hints of bitterness between a pair of them which is explored later on in the movie. Enter Laila (Katrina Khaif) a beautiful free willed woman who has a profound effect on one of our bachelors and ends up traveling with them from one sun-drenched locale to the next.\n\nZNMD is a character driven film, the opening credits are informative as they give us a taste of what these characters are like, we see Imraan charming air hostesses while Arjun (a workaholic) typing away on his laptop. Zoya has done a good job at character development through subtle interactions and dialogue, like Arjun's sudden mention of how he wants to pay for stuff now since Kabir did that in their childhood to Imraan's one night stand girl saying his eye's are sad even though he is happy. \n\nThe film explores the theme of life and how to live it, dialogues like \"Insaan ko dibbein mein tabhi rehna chahiye jab wo mar jaye\" have been delivered well and come off as inspiring. The movie also explores a variety of fears the characters suppress and how they overcome these through adventuring; each scene when one of our bachelors overcomes their fears while doing an activity is a sight to behold, our bachelors realise that you will never get this life again and this gives them strength to fight. \n\nUntil the intermission the characters develop well, you learn to love each one, Laila and Imraan especially. ZNMD shows an immense amount of potential in the first half, unfortunately the second half takes that potential, locks it into a box and throws it out of a window.\n\nI didn't mind a gripping central plot not being there during the first half, after all in a character driven film its important to have each character developed and to see what their insecurities are. I hoped that the second half would mix a direct plot and resolutions quite well, unfortunately this doesn't happen, the movie becomes as predictable as ever. By the end of the film I was still waiting for a good plot, which is on some levels acceptable in a highly character driven film that has great pacing, ZNMD however doesn't seem to know the meaning of pacing; too much time went by without interesting events happening, when some progression came most of the time it felt unnecessary or highly predictable. It seemed the entire audience was bored by the time a sad song near the end played, many people even left the cinema hall. \n\nThe main cast has done a good job; Farhan worked great as the fun loving goof Imraan, he did have the best dialogues out of all the characters which helped but to be fair his excellent dialogue delivery also played a part in us liking the dialogues, the \"mere dost mujhe majnu bulate hain\"  line would be worth rolling eyes over, but the way he said made us only love his character more. Abhay did well too, he had to show quite a large change of emotions, going from being a mediator to someone in denial, he pulled of each facet of the characters emotional ride pretty well. Hrithik acted well too although at times his performance felt forced, as it was a corporate man coming out of his cage maybe this was the intention. Most of all the chemistry between our three main leads, lets call it bromistry was impeccable, you could really believe they were best friends, their affections towards each other never came off as forced. The supporting cast has did well too; Katrina for once isn't in the film just for eye candy, her performance is as good as her looks, she fit the part of free willed Laila to the tee and showed great screen presence. Despite how atrocious Kalki's character was, she has played the role very well, her singing while driving was her best scene although that isn't saying much as its the only scene where one doesn't want to strangle her character. \n\nThe songs in the film came off as unnecessary, apart from the Tomatino festival one, it seemed like they were put in just because they had to be in there. I do believe Bollywood is at a point now where songs have plot relevance, in a film where pacing was already lacking, shoehorning songs in didn't help at all.\n\nThe cinematographer deserves a standing ovation, never has Spain looked so beautiful, never have songs - albeit pointless - seemed so real in how they would actually play out. The writers must take a bow, the comic scenes in this film aren't disgusting in humor like Delhi Belly but they are actually funny, they feel natural, none of the dialogue feels forced. Special mention must go out to the poetic interludes that concludes each act of the film, they describe what the characters went through pretty well and stick in your mind after the end credits roll. The film on the whole has competent direction, the performance from the cast and dialogue delivery shows this; however Zoya once again fails at being able to pace a film well (this was also an issue in Luck By Chance), the film doesn't have a great story, tight pacing could have overcome this weakness, as Delhi Belly has proven.\n\nZNMD is a disappointment, not because I expected a lot but because the first half is full of great potential that is wasted in the second half. After setting up a great set of characters we had all come to know as our friends, the second half became predictable, dreary and long winded. Once in a while the film has stunning moments where the direction, acting, cinematography and most importantly the background music all come together to create magic on screen, these moments are present in each of the adventure parts, these moments make you feel like Haa, Zindagi Na Milegi Doobara, so lets enjoy each moment and treasure it. Its not often when a film affects your outlook on life in this way and for that reason alone ZNMD went from being a mediocre film to a good one.\n\n7/10",

The film is totally fun to watch and is a laugh riot in the first half. However the second half is too stretchy and this is where Zoya Akhtar has fallen weak in direction. All three have done good job and Abhay Deol especially is funny where Farhan is strong given the prominent dialogues. The sequences are long and irrelevant. In the end the purpose of Imran is left questionable and feels to be irrelevantly forced into the movie. The songs are mostly just added to increase the duration but they are good especially Paint it Red and Senorita. The first half is filled with punches and quick humor. So definitely one will like it although the second half has weakened the movie. Its definitely worth one watch.",

One might think ZNMD is an offspring of Hangover and Dil Chahta Hai (which is what I gathered from the promos), but there's much more to the movie than that:\n\n- Exotic locations - Check (Have always loved Spain!)\n- A great cast - Check\n- Refreshing soundtrack - Check (Prolly d best S-E-L work in a long time)\n- A bagful of L-O-L moments - Check (Japanese school girl, Bagwati, Chudail alert!)\n- And the heart and mind in the right places - CHECK!\n\nIf at all I have any problem with the movie (and its very very puny) its that the movie tends to be a bit preachy. But the best part is that its not the Aamir-Khan-kinda preachy. It's more like being advised by a very close friend whom you have known for years!\n\nA filmmaker is as good as his/her last movie. By that logic, I love Zoya Akhtar for giving us Luck By Chance. And I thought, it would be difficult to top that.

All of theml did a good job on an individual level, but I somehow felt an odd chemistry between them when they were together, it just didn't feel as genuine as I would have liked.\r\n\r\nThe second half does drag quite a bit with the story not really going anywhere, instead it seemes that most of its time was spent advertising Spain. The other major weak point was the movie's songs.\r\n\r\nOverall, a decent movie which though is well made, could have been polished a bit more.",

It's like they had a ton of ideas, but were too eager to just get it rolling that didn't really carve it out well enough. Overall, the movie has a good effect, is well done, is different from the rest, but this needs to be said: it could have been immensely better if they'd implemented the ideas a little more smartly.

            "content": "In one of the defining moments of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the three friends, along with their diving instructor, have just surfaced from the depths of the seas and the feeling of having experienced life in each breath is sinking in... while the sun sets along the Spanish coastline. The richness of this moment is not only depicted in the beauty of the shot itself but also in the calm that descended upon such exuberant individuals. \r\nThrough the medium of the film, Zoya Akhtar is reminding us to let our fears drown in the essence of the moment that is Now. Take a deep breath and live this day as it were your last. Though a familiar ideology, it has never been presented with such tenderness, subtlety and beauty. Add Zoya's touch of light-hearted, intelligent, unadulterated humour and we have an easy to soak entertainer. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara doesn't preach a way of living but simply reminds us of it and does so in a manner that will make you smile in the end.\r\n\r\n\tKabir (Abhay Deol) is the first of the Three Musketeers who is about to break away from bachelorhood and as per their old pact, they take a road-trip that includes each one's surprise adventure along the way. This isn't remotely close to a 'Hangover' style Bachelor party but more like a bachelor trip that takes male-bonding to a level that was once defined in 'Dil Chahta Hai'. Even though Kabir may appear to be the audacious, fun loving guy, his marriage is a worrisome matter for him which he tries to conceal from his friends. \r\nImraan (Farhan Akhtar) is the funniest of the lot and while he can be a kid sometimes, he appears restless and anxious when it comes to tracing his real father Salman, in Spain. \r\nArjun (Hrithik Roshan) is an ambitious financial broker in London, who is unable to separate himself from his work while on vacation because he plans to retire rich at age 40. However, it is their friendship and the common zeal for life that bonds them and makes them do crazy things to strangers and themselves. \r\nOn their first adventure, diving instructor Laila (Katrina Kaif) introduces them to her idea of living freely, without worries and plans. From hereon, begins the journey of discovering true living for the trio whose adventures mean a lot more than just sports. The more they let go of themselves, the more they embrace their true selves. \r\n\r\n\tThe moment they arrive in Spain to the tunes of Dil Jaise Dhadke Dhadakne do, we know what's in store for us. Kabir with his pranks on strangers, Imraan with his witty one-liners and spontaneous sense of humour and Arjun, whose devotion to work literally goes out of the window during the journey, provide us with chuckles and guffaws through innovative situations and interactions. The humour throughout, is clean, witty and refreshingly different from what we have seen post- '3 Idiots'.  Abhay Deol is well suited to his character who plays the prankster among friends and the resilient fiance of Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). His character faces more dilemmas throughout and he has handled those situations well. Kalki was passable in her role which the viewer wouldn't be too fond of in any case. Maybe, she might have succeeded in making us feel that way, which should be an accomplishment. \r\nFinally, Hrithik Roshan has a role where he can enjoy himself and the audience can enjoy watching him perform all his talents. Apart from looking like a Greek God, he dresses like a GQ model, laughs, jokes and dances as fluently as he speaks Spanish. It is a treat to watch Hrithik off a wheelchair (Guzaarish) and be a part of a memorable movie after a dull period of 2 years. These are the kind of films he should be doing.\r\nKatrina Kaif's character may have been overshadowed by the boys but as an actress, this film should give her more confidence than ever. She gets to speak out the best dialogues, always keep that sweetest smile on her, dress casually and yet look most stunning and leave a lasting impression upon millions of hearts. \r\nFarhan Akhtar is hands down, the highlight of the film's performances. With witty dialogues and a quirky sense of humour, he gets to have most of the fun. He lets himself go with his character and exposes himself to signing, dancing, fooling around, being impulsive, being childish and sometimes, being really mature. He has left good impressions before but this time, he exceeds expectations. \r\nPerhaps the secret to such good performances is Zoya's writing and screenplay that allows the actors to be themselves rather than their characters. They just seem so much at ease and with such good understanding of situations that it looks very credible. \r\n\r\n\tThrough Carlos Catalan's superlative cinematography, we not only witness Spain in its magnificent splendour but also the director's vision of a screenplay that speaks without dialogue. As the actors dive into the depths of the sea, drive through the Spanish countryside, fall from the airplane or paint the world red, Zoya's envisioned screenplay is adroitly depicted like a work of art. What the characters experience in those moments isn't described in words but through slow motion capture of the camera and a screenplay that lets the scene and actor's expression speak in emotions and beauty. \r\nWhile these characteristics of direction and cinematography form the strength of the film, it is Jaaved Akhtar's poetry, spoken through Farhaan in those inspiring moments, that forms the soul of the movie. Not only is the writing rich and meaning deep, but also the effect of its narration is pure magic. \r\n\r\n\tShankar Ehsaan Loy have given us melodious tunes which will only grow with each listen after having watched the movie. Dil Jaise Dhadke is peppy and its chorus is uplifting. Der lagi lekin is a soulful track that is brilliantly rendered by Shankar Mahadevan. Truly, accolade worthy. Ik Junoon (Paint it red) is catchy and well suited to the La Tomatina festival. Suraj ki baahon mein is a foot-tapping track that all actors eventually dance to but it is  Senorita that is most fun to watch as all three of them take to the stage and Hrithik comes in his invincible form.\r\n\r\n\tZNMD portrays richness and maturity of the director's skill as well as the talents of the actors. Sincere performances in credible situations enable the very real feel from the movie. While Spain, being the silent hero of the film, will inspire travelers with its resplendent beauty that is explored through journeys, many will relate to Imraan's poetry and the adventurous achievements of the trio.\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable attribute does remain the film's ability to convey so much in its silent scenes in spectacular backdrops. Simple moments now look enriched with deeper meaning and all credit goes to Zoya Akhtar's vision of a road-trip that is definitely worth a ride. \r\n\r\n9.123 on a scale of 1-10.",
