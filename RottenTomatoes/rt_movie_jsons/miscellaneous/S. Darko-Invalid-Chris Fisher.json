Seven years after her brother's death Samantha Darko runs into Roberta Sparrow's grandson while traveling to L.A., and is called upon by forces from the beyond to help him close a tangent universe that threatens to destroy the world.  The film does an interesting role reversal by taking the perspective of the Manipulated Dead; as it's the spirit of Dead-Samantha that guides Sparrow.  And, in keeping with the Samantha character, the tone and visual style incorporates a fantasy-esque theme.  Starring Daveigh Chase, Briana Evigan, Ed Westwick, and Elizabeth Berkley, the casting is fairly good.  However, the script is poorly written, and lacks the sophistication and cleverness of the original.  Additionally, while the soundtrack complements the mood and tone of the film, it doesn't feel characteristic of the mid-90s.  S. Darko is a stylish and intriguing thriller, but it tries too hard to compete with Donnie Darko and ends up being overly convoluted.",

Those reviews are wrong. This is a well made, entertaining film with all the style of the original. It essentially retells Donnie's 'Living Receiver' tale from the perspective of the 'Manipulated Dead' (Frank the Bunny) to give the viewer a new perspective on Roberta Sparrow's book on time travel. The only thing that is missing is a character to really root for - you want Donnie to succeed in the original because he's such an interesting character, but Sam Darko turns out to be a bit of a bore. If you're one of the many people who loved the original Donnie you probably won't like this because of the lack of such a character, but if you were lukewarm on it then this one might make you look at the first movie in a new light.",

It's an utterly nonsensical film, but it's a camp classic that is waiting to be discovered because it is B-movie gold that made me laugh more than a lot of comedies I've seen (I laughed so hard at some points that I actually had tears in my eyes because some scenes were so gut-bustingly funny).

The film has a poorly written script, bad directing and a very poor cast. This film doesn't have anything good going for it. Painful and unwatchable. This sequel is a mess from start to finish, and it doesn't have the psychological tension that the first film did. This is a poor sequel that should never have been made. The director crafts a sloppy film and with a poor cast and script, it's clear to see why as a psychological horror film, S. Darko fails miserably. There's not a shroud of creative integrity here and simply put this sequel is a slap in the face to the great psychological horror flick, Donnie Darko which was released in 2001. This is a film that is definitely not worth your time and you should check out the first instead. Director Chris Fisher clearly lacks any directing flair, and can't grasp the material that was established so well in the original. There's nothing worth seeing in this to really make it stand out. All this film is is an exercise in awful filmmaking. This is a clichéd piece of trash that fans of the first should definitely avoid. If you're looking for poor filmmaking then look no further than S. Darko. The biggest problem with this film is that it tries too hard at outdoing the original, but fails and in doing so; we have a film with a cast that deliver bad dialogue, and a very poor plot. There's nothing here that will please fans of Richard Kelley's psychological horror Cult classic.",

The original film literally had me tense while watching the film, dreading the countdown, but curious. This movie had none of that. Maybe in the hands of another writer, the same elements could have been used to make a good film. I'd jump at the importunity to try. Daveigh Chase acted well in this, but the confusion of her character might just have been the confusion of the actress, as I'm not sure she even understood the story.\n\nThird time's the charm?",

The concepts from \"Donnie Darko\" that have been duplicated here lack the soul and spine-chilling heaviness that pervaded throughout the original film. It's unfortunate how hollow these images play out once devoid of all unique flair and purpose.\n\nI mean, sure, the effects are passable, and some moments even get a little creepy. Hell, even the acting isn't horrendous (in fact, the characters are so good at playing completely clueless douchebags that you're fine when misfortune befalls them). But with the story lacking substance and with plot holes the size of Utah's Mormon population, this is an undeniably ugly attempt at continuing the pedigree.\n\nFor the rest of my review, please check out my movie review blog: http://filmsallthetime.blogspot.com/2012/07/brians-review-s-darko.html",

I can't write any more than that without including some very serious spoilers, but I will say this:\n\nThe sacrifice made in the first movie prevents a lot of tragedy by disrupting the flow of events to come.  The sacrifice in this movie, however, prevents nothing, as the events in question are already happening when the main characters arrive in town.

DARKO [2009]:  Eight years after the 2001 Cult movie phenomena of DONNIE DARKO this 2009 straight to DVD sequel was made. Unlike the original film, the film was not made or written by the original writer director Richard Kelly was not involved with this film at all. S. DARKO or better yet Sequel DARKO sees the late Donnie's kid sister Samantha Darko now 17 years old in the year 1995 with her friend travelling across the state of Utah after her Family has broken up after Donnie's bizarre and horrific death. Upon getting stranded in a small town, Samantha starts to sleepwalk just like her brother instead she becomes a haunting vision for a disturbed Gulf War veteran called Iraq Jack who she convinces that the world will end in four days. When a meteor narrowly misses Jack, the same bizarre stuff that occurred in the first film again reoccurs in this film with the same ending as the first film.\r\n\r\n No were near as bold and original as the DONNIE DARKO, this film borrows way too much from that film but at least it isn't that bad. To hardcore fans of DONNIE DARKO this film will be too much for you to swallow, my rating is a simple 60% for this film.",

I'll compare this sequel to the original in much the same way I view 'The Blair Witch Project' to 'Book of Shadows' in that it works if looked at as a companion rather than a direct sequel.\r\n\r\nIt captured the feel and authenticity of its predecessor for the most part, and tied in alot of its history and mythology. Plenty of negatives, as the acting is mostly mediocre. (a strong performance by Daveigh Chase nothwithstanding) Ed Westwick is truly awful as is to be expected.\r\n\r\nI felt it tried to do way too much. Too many subplots going on which are never really explained and it never seems to reach the climax it should. The writing is solid and the film offers an interesting and creepy vibe.",

            "content": "When Donnie Darko was originally released on DVD, the film sparked such a firestorm of interest that nobody (including the production studio) had seen coming. Released to theaters in 2001 and blending a fantastic tale of time travel, loss and rejection; the original film received widespread critical acclaim and had the instant makings of a cult classic. Personally, I've seen Donnie Darko on more than 5 occasions since it's release (theatrical and director's cut) and consider it to be one of my 25 all-time favorite films. I know there are plenty of folks out there that despise the film (my stepdad being one of them), but every time I watch Richard Kelly's creation, I've come away feeling one stop closer to understanding the core of the story. I've always felt a film's lasting appeal through multiple viewings is one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking, and Donnie Darko still stands as a perfect example.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm not here to talk about Donnie Darko and you're clearly reading this review with an interest in the 2009 sequel, S. Darko. It's a dangerous game to make a sequel to an iconic film with a cult following; since you run the risk of alienating the fan base with a sub par film - and turning away the uninitiated that may stumble onto this release with zero knowledge of the original film. As a big fan of the first film, I approached this release with equal parts hesitation and excitement at the thought of continuing the intricately woven tale that began with Donnie Darko. Sadly, the results were not what I was hoping for.\r\n\r\nThe story picks up 7 years after the events of the prior film, with Donnie's sister Samantha (Daveigh Chase reprising her role) on a road trip to Los Angeles with her best friend Corey (Briana Evigan). The two girls find themselves stranded in the town of Conejo Springs when their car breaks down along the highway. Shacking up in a dive-motel, Corey befriends a local tough guy named Randy (Ed Westwick) who promises to fix their car when he has a free moment (which proves to be difficult given his propensity for beer and partying). Plagued by nightmares since the death of her brother, Samantha finds herself waking in odd places throughout the town, and a strange man known as Iraq Jack (James Lafferty) believes she's a princess that's been appearing to him at night with predictions of the world's destruction. In addition, there seems to be a kidnapper in the town, since at least two young children have disappeared in the months leading up to Samantha's arrival. The townspeople suspect Iraq Jack (James Lafferty) of the crimes, but Samantha begins to develop her own suspicions about some less than savory characters that cross her path. In case you were wondering, there's also an element of time travel, but I'll refrain from going into further detail since I can't honestly explain the filmmaker's intentions in a cohesive manner.\r\n\r\nAfter watching S. Darko, it becomes painfully clear why the film was released straight to home video. The lack of a coherent plotline is the driving force behind my dislike for the film and I was a bit let-down by the amateurish nature of the entire production. Donnie Darko was a low-budget film, but Richard Kelly's story managed to pull you in from the very beginning and hold your undivided attention without the use of flashy special effects. I've always delighted in films that keep the viewer in the dark, or force you to draw your own conclusions about the plot (the films of David Lynch are a perfect example), but S. Darko doesn't even have a foundation on which to build. It seemed as though the filmmakers watched Donnie Darko - couldn't understand the film, and decided to make a sequel using a mishmash of elements from the first film. On the bright side, the atmosphere plays tribute to the original film with the same creepy synthesized voice-over, and the happy-go-lucky tone that's interwoven with a pervasive sense of dread; but a cheap knock off is still a cheap knock off.\r\n\r\nThe worst aspect of the film is the incorporation of time travel, which kills the entire experience on multiple occasions. I'm bothered by films that use the old-age \"thank god, it was all just a bad dream\" trick, and S. Darko manages to pull that stunt twice (except time-travel is the cop-out in this case). My other disappointment is the incorporation of tidbits that are only added to please fans of the first film, but offer no value in furthering the story. I'm not giving anything away by mentioning that Iraq Jack turns out to be Justin Sparrow (son of the author that wrote the time travel book mention on several occasions in Donnie Darko), since it's completely meaningless to the overall story of this film.\r\n\r\nMoving on to the acting in the film, get ready to be disappointed again. I wasn't looking for a high caliber of acting in this straight-to-video sequel, but I certainly thought it would be better. Daveigh Chase has proven to be a promising young actor in her role on the HBO series \"Big Love\" (I'd highly recommend the show if you've never seen it), but her acting in S. Darko is a little uncomfortable to watch. Perhaps she had a tough time accepting her leading role status, or she just couldn't identify with the character, but her mannerisms and line-delivery made me feel that she wasn't ready to tackle the role of Samantha. The rest of the cast doesn't fair much better, but I think that was largely due to the one-dimensional way each character was portrayed in the story and not entirely the fault of the actors.\r\n\r\nS. Darko isn't a miserable way to spend a couple of hours, but it's certainly frustrating. If you consider yourself a fan of Donnie Darko, you'll likely feel cheated by the lack of a cohesive plot and come away from the experience with resentment toward the creators of this sequel. In many ways it's like being sold tickets to an AC/DC cover band, and then finding out the band doesn't even know the words to the songs. I had hoped S. Darko would be handled by a group of creative individuals that understood the charm and intricacy of the original film, but it's clear that's not the case.",

Other then that, the film feels a bit self-indulgent, trying to capture the origanal sinister philosophy of the first one, without the beautiful entracing performance by Gyllenhaal. The characters lack development and the script crawls along multiple planes of unrealistic emotions. A terrible attempt at a sequel to a franchise that best be left as it is.",

Sadly, I cannot say the same for the sequel, and understand why the director of the original (Richard Kelly) refused to be involved in any way with the making of a sequel.\r\n\r\nTo explain - Donnie Darko is an extremely well thought out film, with everything seamlessly tied together at the end. And although it is also complicated, it does make complete sense to those who ponder endlessly over it. Everything is perfect. Sadly, this is not the case with S. Darko.\r\n\r\nIt seems Fisher has taken the basic elements from the original film - time travel, a complicated plot, and the future trails - and exploited them.\r\n\r\nLet's take the future trails: he uses them more often than he should, and makes it seem on a couple of occasions that they are alive (they react to the person). Although it is fine to interpret these things differently, as a viewer, I did not think it worked.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing seems yet another film about a misunderstood, mopey teenager, which we have seen enough of in Twilight. Although Donnie in the original film was mopey, the audience were also led to believe he was slightly mad. In this film, the main character is simply dislikeable.\r\n\r\nOne final flaw - the special effects resemble something out of Smallville. They make the film so much less believeable, and prevent the viewer from becoming lost in the universe, as they were in the original.\r\n\r\nIf you are a huge Donnie Darko fan, I highly suggest you skip the sequel altogether.",

The characters are very one dimensional and the acting is very bad and mediocre with horrible acting by Ed Westwick which is probably the worst acting and delivering of lines I have ever seen performed on film!

From watching \"The Making of...\" extra feature you could see that a lot of them were big fans of the first film and a few involved were a little embarassed with it before it came out.\r\n\r\nSo what was good about it? Well little Sam Darko (Chase), now 18 has grown up a lot and is really quite hot in an innocent way. Her friend Corey (Evigan) is also pretty hot. The scenary is quite pleasent also. \r\n\r\nAnd that's about all.\r\n\r\nIf there was no Donnie Darko then this might be a passable 50%. The storyline by itself could have worked but it was like trying to fit a square peg in an undersized round hole. There is simply nothing at all eerie or spooky about two hotties in skimpy clothes (an attractive but very cheap trick), a gay looking policeman, two bible bashers and an Iraq veteren. In fact, except for Darko herself none of the characters are explored and she is barely. Lafferty as Iraq Jack perhaps puts in the best performance aside from Chase.\r\n\r\nDonnie's film worked as it took the totally mundane and made it weird. Samantha's was set in somewhere that could be weird and with people who could be weird but just ended up being boring. There was zero of the interesting nerdiness of the first film either. \r\n\r\nIt's hardly surprising that the director of Donnie Darko wanted nothing to do with this and only Chase from the original cast returned. It's not the dire, terrible film the critics make it out to be, and I would encourage you to watch it once. But it had an impossible act to follow and failed miserably.",

Darko.  Here's the thing - I somehow managed to miss Donnie Darko altogether.  I think it came out before I would have been interested in this sort of movie.  By the time S. Darko came out, that had been rectified.  So one night my brother and I were hanging out with a good friend, watching movies.  He had a pretty nice selection of stuff I hadn't seen, and I was vying for Evan Almighty.  Needless to say, I complained heavily when my brother and our friend chose to watch the sequel to a movie I hadn't seen.  They told me to shut up and just watch it, or leave.  So I watched it.\r\n\r\nSo the whole story of the movie got my mind working, and I was willing to look past the questionable (at best) acting and directing.  I also resolved to watch Donnie Darko as soon as possible, which happened to be several months later when I stumbled upon it in my brother's Netflix instant queue.  \r\n\r\nHere's the breakdown on my score for this movie.  I really liked S. Darko when I first saw it, and likely would have given it closer to 100% had I not later watched Donnie Darko.  Since watching the first of the two movies, I still sort of like S. Darko, but now I realize that it was more of a rehashing of ideas already expressed in the first movie.",

The point of this movie was to show two things, the effect that Donnie's life had on his family, which it did. Samantha was clearly scarred by it and was afraid to hold anyone too close. Secondly, it was supposed to show that Donnie wasn't alone. That the use of portals was a choice not to be taken likely, that history repeats itself to the unwise, and only by owning your mistakes and recognizing what was/wasn't your responsibility can you make a positive change in the world.\r\n\r\nThis film met those two goals just fine. I took 20% off because of kinda bad (not horrible, but not award-winning) acting, and bad directing. But if you stop trying to compare this to its predecessor you'll see the movie for what it is. While Donnie Darko was about alienation, love-loss, and trying to to the right thing, this movie was about change. Changing yourself, changing those around you, growing up, and seeing yourself for who you are, were and could be. \r\n\r\nThere's a reason why it's called \"S. Darko: A Donnie Darko Tale\", rather than \"Donnie Darko Returns\" or \"Donnie Darko: This Time it's Personal!\". It's a story about someone who was in Donnie Darko's life, but Donnie's life actually have very little to do with the plot, it just influenced his sister's perspective which led to the decisions that brought her to the events in this film.\r\n\r\nTake the movie for what it is, not for what you wanted it to be.",

            "content": "When Donnie Darko was originally released on DVD, the film sparked a firestorm of interest that nobody (including the production studio) had seen coming. Released to theaters in 2001 and blending a fantastic tale of time travel, loss and rejection; the original film received widespread critical acclaim and had the instant makings of a cult classic. Personally, I've seen Donnie Darko on more than 5 occasions since it's release (theatrical and director's cut) and consider it to be one of my 25 all-time favorite films. I know there are plenty of folks out there that despise the film (my wife being one of them), but every time I watch Richard Kelly's creation, I've come away feeling one step closer to understanding the core of the story. I've always felt a film's lasting appeal through multiple viewings is one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking, and Donnie Darko still stands as a perfect example.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm not here to talk about Donnie Darko and you're clearly reading this review with an interest in the 2009 sequel, S. Darko. It's a dangerous game to make a sequel to an iconic film with a cult following; since you run the risk of alienating the fan base with a sub par film--and turning away the uninitiated that may stumble onto this release with zero knowledge of the original film. As a big fan of the first film, I approached this release with equal parts hesitation and excitement at the thought of continuing the intricately woven tale that began with Donnie Darko. Sadly, the results were not what I was hoping for.\r\n\r\nThe story picks up 7 years after the events of the prior film, with Donnie's sister Samantha (Daveigh Chase reprising her role) on a road trip to Los Angeles with her best friend Corey (Briana Evigan). The two girls find themselves stranded in the town of Conejo Springs when their car breaks down along the highway. Shacking up in a dive-motel, Corey befriends a local tough guy named Randy (Ed Westwick) who promises to fix their car when he has a free moment (which proves to be difficult given his propensity for beer and partying). Plagued by nightmares since the death of her brother, Samantha finds herself waking in odd places throughout the town, and a strange man known as Iraq Jack (James Lafferty) believes she's a princess that's been appearing to him at night with predictions of the world's destruction. In addition, there seems to be a kidnapper in the town, since at least two young children have disappeared in the months leading up to Samantha's arrival. The townspeople suspect Iraq Jack (James Lafferty) of the crimes, but Samantha begins to develop her own suspicions about some less than savory characters that cross her path. In case you were wondering, there's also an element of time travel, but I'll refrain from going into further detail since I can't honestly explain the filmmaker's intentions in a cohesive manner.\r\n\r\nAfter watching S. Darko, it becomes painfully clear why the film was released straight to home video. The lack of a coherent plotline is the driving force behind my dislike for the film and I was a bit let-down by the amateurish nature of the entire production. Donnie Darko was a low-budget film, but Richard Kelly's story managed to pull you in from the very beginning and hold your undivided attention without the use of flashy special effects. I've always delighted in films that keep the viewer in the dark, or force you to draw your own conclusions about the plot (the films of David Lynch are a perfect example), but S. Darko doesn't even have a foundation on which to build. It seemed as though the filmmakers watched Donnie Darko--couldn't understand the film, and decided to make a sequel using a mishmash of elements from the first film. On the bright side, the atmosphere pays tribute to the original film with the same creepy synthesized voice-over, and the happy-go-lucky tone that's interwoven with a pervasive sense of dread; but a cheap knock off is still a cheap knock off.\r\n\r\nThe worst aspect of the film is the incorporation of time travel, which kills the entire experience on multiple occasions. I'm bothered by films that use the age-old \"thank god, it was all just a bad dream\" trick, and S. Darko manages to pull that stunt twice (except time-travel is the cop-out in this case). My other disappointment is the incorporation of tidbits that are only added to please fans of the first film, but offer no value in furthering the story. I'm not giving anything away by mentioning that Iraq Jack turns out to be Justin Sparrow (son of the author that wrote the time travel book mentioned on several occasions in Donnie Darko), since it's completely meaningless to the overall story of this film.\r\n\r\nMoving on to the acting in the film, get ready to be disappointed again. I wasn't looking for a high caliber of acting in this straight-to-video sequel, but I certainly thought it would be better. Daveigh Chase has proven to be a promising young actor in her role on the HBO series \"Big Love\" (I'd highly recommend the show if you've never seen it), but her acting in S. Darko is a little uncomfortable to watch. Perhaps she had a tough time accepting her leading role status, or she just couldn't identify with the character, but her mannerisms and line-delivery made me feel that she wasn't ready to tackle the role of Samantha. The rest of the cast doesn't fair much better, but I think that was largely due to the one-dimensional way each character was portrayed in the story and not entirely the fault of the actors. \r\n\r\nS. Darko isn't a miserable way to spend a couple of hours, but it's certainly frustrating. If you consider yourself a fan of Donnie Darko, you'll likely feel cheated by the lack of a cohesive plot and come away from the experience with resentment toward the creators of this sequel. In many ways it's like being sold tickets to an AC/DC cover band, and then finding out the band doesn't even know the words to the songs. I had hoped S. Darko would be handled by a group of creative individuals that understood the charm and intricacy of the original film, but it's clear that's not the case. Those of you who've never seen Donnie Darko should go rent that film instead, or take a leap of faith and blind purchase it.",

Unlike the first one, whose ending had purpose and left you feeling strangely fulfilled and happy with life, this one left off everyone's lives in turmoil.

Darko has the look and feel of Donnie Darko. I liked how the story was both a logical followup, plus a fresh reversal of Donnie Darko's personal time travel predicament. Woefully, the execution could've been much better. None of the characters and ideas were fleshed out well enough. I didn't care enough about the characters to grieve their sacrifice; I wasn't moved to tears like I was at the end of Donnie Darko. Some characters were downright annoying and some unbelievable. What was with the geeky meteorite-boy; was he influenced by the space rock or was he always a creep? (BTW - nice Jeff Goldblum impression!) Recklessly, there were too many characters and storylines tossed around - and not enough connective plotting to tie everything together like the masterpiece original. I liked some of the subtle references to the first Darko, but others were curiously forced; like the metallic rabbit mask and the Time Travel book. Worst thing of all was the setting was no longer in the magical 80's, so they played 1995 tunes; which took me out of the serious moments. \n\"\nI totally agree I felt the same things and wanna say the same things about actors, setting way to shoot the movie..\nMah.",

But, there's no cheesy one-liners, no bad acting, and the plot was just as twisted as the original. I was kinda hoping for a mid 90's soundtrack to supplement the awesome 80's one of D.

I don't even mean on some deep metaphysical level, I mean the basic plot and concepts presented. This barely feels like a full outline much less a final script. It actually resorts to completely rewinding itself not once but twice. Worst of all is that fact that after finally reaching its conclusion it actually has no internal logic. Donnie's sacrifice at the end of the original film resolved the paradox. There is no indication that the actions at the films conclusion will change anything regarding the apocalypse at hand. To the film makers I say, \"you bought the rights to the film, is this really all you could come up with?

By the third time they went back in time for one of them to live, I was annoyed. Some of the subplots feel as if thrown in there to pad things out, and never make sense with the rest of the movie.

            "content": "There is a fundamental problem when a different director, along with different writers try to elaborate on such an original idea.  Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko was a masterpiece, it was a dark, chilling story about time travel, parallel universe and the end of the world, and yet found time to include a subtext about existential teen angst and alienation.  All of the lead and supporting actors did a wonderful job, the incorporation of pop songs was the best I've seen for any film, and the cinimatography was excellent.  And the movie, while confusing, wrapped itself up nicely at the end.\r\n\r\nS. Darko, on the other hand, plays out more like a piece of fan fiction than a proper sequel.  It borrows all of the superficial plot elements of the original film  and rehashes them into a new movie. While I have no problem with the idea, that Donnie's younger sister encounters similar events as her brother, the film doesnt really say anything new.  A good sequel should elaborate on what came before, and make things a little clearer.  While the events of the first film are mentioned, they are never really elaborated on.  No light is shed on Donnie's fate.\r\n\r\nIf Donnie Darko had never been made and this was the first one, then I would give it a better rating, the movie isn't terrible.  It is interesting, although it doesn't come together at the end like the first one.  It just that when you begin to borrow key scenes and dialouge (even the same voice) from the orginal film, you begin to look like a hack.  There are even numerous camera angles and fast forward/rewind sequences that are directly copied (for instance the party scene in the first film, which was an important scene, is copied for this film, except the party serves no real purpose.  It is just filler).   There is also the reapperence of the rabbit, but it has been taken out of context and seemed also placed in just to carry it over from the first film.  Once again, I have no proble with that, except hey never explain why its there (if you see this film, you will know why they need to explain it)\r\n\r\nBut it seemed like it was an honest effort to continue the story.  But ultimatley its a failed one",

        {
            "content": "Direct-to-video sequel to 2001's \"Donnie Darko\" is a far cry from the cult classic status it's prequel has earned.  Here's Samantha Darko (Daveigh Chase, \"The Ring\") is now 18 and having a bit of a sleep issue after her brother Donnie was crushed by a falling plane engine in the first film.  So she runs away from home with her BFF Corey (Briana Evigan) to head cross country.  They break down in East-Nowhere-Bumfuck where the meet Randy (Ed Westwick) who drives them into a small town where all the fun begins.  Maybe \"fun\" was a poor choice in words.\n\nThings start off slowly with Samantha NOT having similar visions to her brother, but instead her herself being the vision in the eyes of an Desert Storm vet named Iraq Jack (James Lafferty), who's looked upon as the town weirdo.  If you understood how the first one works, and who Frank the bunny ended up being, you'll know exactly what's gonna happen to Samantha.  Thankfully when that does happen, the film is only halfway through, so then we're given another plot involving a murdered kid, Corey's visions, and a bunch of other random, nonsensical stuff.\n\nIt's kind of like the \"everyone has a dark secret\" from \"Twin Peaks\" meets a \"Donnie Darko\" TV series pilot.  Except you could easily make this into 2 or 3 episodes of a series.  On the other hand, the filmmakers watched \"Donnie Darko\", completely misinterpreted it, and made a foul smelling sequel.  The events & themes of the original aren't just rehashed, they're done in the WRONG sense.  \"Donnie Darko\" has confused many people on what exactly is happening.  This sequel is director Chris Fisher's idea (though I'd put more blame on the writers) of what HE thought \"Darko\" was about.  The problem is he's wrong.  The original film is 100% clear if you pay attention, and made even more clear in the Director's Cut.  Fisher is obviously one of 40% or so that had no idea what was happening in the original.\n\nWhat we have here is a smorgasbord of \"how many references can we make to the original?\".  Copy the music score as closely as possible without a lawsuit?  Check.  Have a character drive Frank's red car?  Check.  Reintroduce Frank the Bunny?  Check.  Wait...what is Frank the bunny doing here?  Had the original made any sense to the filmmakers here, they'd realize  Frank the Bunny was a bunny because of the Halloween costume.  It served a purpose in the original film involving FRANK.  His bunny outfit and the reason behind it was explained away at the end and no one else but Donnie should anyone dressed like that.  That is unless Frank gonna come speeding into this movie and run over Gretchen Ross again.  To make this more clear, it's along the same lines as having the bullet time effect in anything BUT \"The Matrix\".  There it served it's purpose, other films, it's just copying it cause it \"looks cool\".  Same for here.\n\nOn the other hand, it's nice to see Daveigh Chase return as Samantha Darko (though she has little to do outside of reacting to everyone else) and I thought everyone else did an alright job.  The acting itself was never a burden on the film, nor were the effects which are done just as well as the original.  Elizabeth Burkley of \"Saved By the Bell\" and \"Showgirls\" has a small meaningless role in the film...that actually has MAJOR meaning...except it's never emphasized.  And the great John Hawkes (\"The Perfect Storm\") appears to do what he does best: play a counter jockey running the motel, something he did better in \"Identity\" and also equally as good as the liquor store clerk from the opening scene of \"From Dusk Til' Dawn\".\n\nHardly any credit can be given to director Chris Fisher as his direction isn't his own, but how close he can come to duplicating Richard Kelly's direction from the first film.  He succeeds in copying most of the sped up shots and angles, mainly clouds moving and the party scene (complete with a person on a trampoline wearing a Halloween mask of an ex-president...pointless when this film takes place on 4th of July weekend).\n\nAnd for those non-faithful believers out there, midway through the film things get super religious as if stopping to say \"And now a message from God\".  Religion isn't just mentioned, it's screamed at you as if trying to convert you.  This isn't the first time that's been done.  Check out the \"Left Behind\" films which are financed through churches (so that's where the money in those donation baskets goes to!) or even \"Starship Troopers 3\", another film which is preachier then your Sunday Mass.\n\nThe film's nothing but an attempt to cash in on the cult classic success of the original, but without Richard Kelly at the helm, one can't expect much.  The use of the budget seems to be done just fine and doesn't affect any aspect as it's flaws lie in the script.  It'll leave a bitter taste in your mouth and even the most die hard \"Donnie Darko\" fans should skip it, because it'll tarnish your image of the original knowing this exists.  On the other hand, grab some shot glasses, a bottle of whiskey, and start taking shots every time an unnecessary copying reference to the original comes up.  You'll be shattered in about 20 minutes, and that's a GOOD THING.",

Donnie Darko was one of the greatest movies I had seen, so I didn't expect much out of this sequel. However, I found S. Darko to have a great story line and I loved how they created it. You have to look at this movie as a stand alone film and forgot about the first one Donnie Darko to be able to truly enjoy it. Yes, it is nowhere near as good as Donnie Darko and it lacks some of the true meaning of the story line. However, if you view it as keeping with the concept it struck perfectly. So, if you are going to watch this movie expecting another Donnie Darko you will be disappointed, but if you feel optimistic and take time to enjoy the S. Darko story line as its own new story you will enjoy it.",

I feel this is a great continuation by an outside director that has built upon a cult classic.  It was dangerous for them to tamper with the original but I give them credit for trying something that is known to be taboo in the film world.  They were smart about it and didn't just make a sequel which allows it to be appreciated.  Daveigh Chase does a great job at developing upon the unknown character of Donnie's little sister and its fortunate they were able to use the same actress.  It is visually beautiful with great shots of the mid-west and has a soundtrack that is euphoric from beginning to end.  I recommend you give it a second chance if that's what it takes for you to get over the fact that Donnie Darko is a much better work of art.",

            "content": "s. Darko wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, but that still isn't saying much. I love Donnie Darko as it seems to be a film that gets better with each viewing. When news that a sequel to the film was being made, the question that plagued me and every other person who was a fan of the first film was, \"Why?\" Did the original really leave much room for a sequel? Not in my eyes. The sequel does little to add to the story established in the first film. It pretty much treads the same ground. The world is going to end again. An element that is different in the film is that more than one person is having the visions this time around. While it makes sense that Sam is having these visions, it doesn't really add up why these other people are having them as well. The movie does a lot of back tracking. A lot of things are explained only to rewind and have it play out differently, which makes full use of the time travel element of the film but kind of leaves the viewer wondering if the film was nothing more than a waste of time once the ending rolls around. The film just seems to recycle most of the ingredients of the first film (time travel, Frank the Bunny...even though he's not Frank this time around, religion playing a roll in the film, black holes, etc) and is unable to establish itself as a decent sequel, let alone its own film.\r\n\r\nThe scene in Donnie Darko that has \"Head Over Heels\" by Tears For Fears playing in the background while we see Donnie arrive at school and the \"Mad World\" scene are really the first scenes that come to mind when I think of the original film. The soundtrack played a pivotal role in the film. In s. Darko, there isn't really a scene like that and the soundtrack is forgettable, which really only hurt the film in the long run.\r\n\r\ns. Darko walks a thin line between paying homage to the original film and complete bastardization. Its plot tries to string the viewer along this intelligent and thought provoking story, but executes doing so in clumsy fashion. It resembles a circus seal waiting for its reward after playing that ensemble with its nose on the horns currently residing in front of it. It'll really only be accessible to people who were fans of the first film, which is ironic since the film will probably just wind up irritating those fans. If you can ignore the first film entirely and have no expectations for this, then you may find yourself with a direct to video release that is...pretty much just that.",

Che, per fortuna, non puÃ² rinascere viaggiando nel tempo, rischiando cosÃ¬ di rivedere un film come S.Darko.\r\n \r\nMi chiedo come la curiositÃ  riesca ancora a vincere sulla consapevolezza del basso livello che possono offrire certi film. Si sapeva giÃ  prima di uscire di casa che S.Darko avrebbe fatto schifo. Ma allora - al di lÃ  di un certo piacere masochistico e della prospettiva di godere di 2 ore di aria condizionata - perchÃ© bisognava averne conferma in prima persona?\r\nEppure la voglia di tornare nell'universo di Donnie ha incastrato me e gli altri 20 spettatori paganti in sala ieri sera. Si puÃ² fare qualcosa a livello legale per fermare chi si impossessa delle figure del nostro immaginario e punta a rovinarle? Non ho mai visto Blues Brothers 2000 per non deturparmi l'icona sacra di Jake ed Elwood. Per fortuna S.Darko sfiora marginalmente il primo film raccontando la storia della sorella di Donnie, Samantha (interpretata dalla stessa ragazzina - ormai cresciuta - dell'originale) e quindi puÃ² essere considerata una cosa talmente lontana da non avere ripercussioni sul primo e unico vero capitolo (forse un po' sopravvalutato, ma comunque intrigante) firmato da Richard Kelly.\r\n \r\nStavolta il regista Chris Fisher butta dentro qualche ingrediente conosciuto dai fan: c'Ã¨ l'icona del coniglio, c'Ã¨ la scena tra le poltrone del cinema, ci sono le canzoni anni '80, ci sono i cieli attraversati da nubi in corsa. Ma mancano la poesia e il fascino misterioso del \"primo appuntamento\". Quasi ogni scena Ã¨ accompagnata da un pianoforte o dagli archi in modo tale che finiscono per non notarsi piÃ¹, mentre ad esempio le note di Gary Jules sottolineavano il climax di Donnie.\r\nAddirittura in questo capitolo (in America uscito solo in dvd non a caso) tutti muoiono, rinascono, viaggiano nel tempo, rimuoiono per salvare qualcun'altro. Alla faccia della Filosofia dei viaggi nel tempo. A tal punto che si fatica persino a capire chi sia il vero protagonista del film.\r\n \r\nStendiamo un velo pietoso sulla recitazione: l'amica di Samantha (\"interpretata\", per cosÃ¬ dire, da Briana Evigan) ha livelli di espressivitÃ  talmente scarsi da suscitare risate (per non parlare del \"figo\" di turno con sigarette arrotolate nella manica della t-shirt). Certo la scrittura dei dialoghi non aiuta e la regia sembra quella che potrebbe fare un teenager dal basso quoziente intellettivo che in tv ha visto solo i peggiori videoclip di 20 anni fa e non ha idea della nozione di \"ritmo\".\r\nPer finire una nota personale: in piÃ¹ occasioni, durante la visione, mi sono messo a starnutire.

You canât. But that doesnât mean that you should avoid it like the plague right?\nDonnie Darko was the complete package, from the story right down to the soundtrack, it had it all.\nI canât say there has been too many times in my life that once the credits have started rolling straightaway you hit play again and still be in oweâ¦thatâs the Donnie Darko experience. It never getâs repetitive. It never gets boring.\nTaking all of this into consideration and after reading some awful reviews I braced myself for the worstâ¦to S Darkoâs credit the worst never came, some elements of this movie were very tight, the backdrop for the movie is breathtaking for example, some of the ideas are decent but itâs some what overshadowed by the ambition to be more clever, more mind-boggling and more tasking on the brain. Itâs almost trying to hard to be accepted by fans and it becomes the movies major downfallâ¦Do you need so many layers? I actually like the fact that no matter what was changed the boy was still going to die (or at least thatâs how I see it) if you didnât know better youâd almost say that this was some sort of vanity project.\nIâm staggered to find out that Richard Kelly wasnât involved with the process or by the sounds of it even consulted?  His vision and direction would have been need for this to have any chance to add to the legacy of the first.\nI think a better idea would have been to ask the fans to come up with some ideas, to use the passion people have for Donnie Darko and I believe the movie would have been better for doing soâ¦   \nI also think Frank was such an integral part of the first movie and itâs seems to me as if  âheâ is only giving a token partâ¦why wasnât the Frank we know and love brought back? \nalthough not as bad as I feared I still think they should have left Donnie Darko as a stand alone masterpiece, Iâm sure most fans of Donnie Darko have sat down at some point and made their own story up in their heads on what happened after Donnie sacrificed himself, I almost feel like my own story has been taking away, feeling a little robbed. The beauty of Donnie Darko is it left it open for you to decide for yourself.\nS Darko may get better with time, and a second viewing Iâm sure wonât be far away but I think they could have explored better avenues, personally I wouldnât have gone down the Samantha route but Cherita Chen for me would have been a more interesting story to tell.\nItâs hard to score this movie, I wanted to love it despite the critics panning it and knowing it wouldnât hit the heights of the first. All in all not great but Iâve seen a lot worstâ¦hopefully next time will be better.",

After meeting the entire town in a day, strange events occur which all unsurprisingly mimic the plot line of D. Darko. \n  Despite the low budget graphics, and poor story line; the movies cast really shines through in the film. Jackson Rathbone(Twilight) absolutely amazed me with his role as the nerdy Jeremy.  Likewise Daveigh Chase, who was also in D. Darko, was seductively inspiring with her come back role as Sam Darko. \n   So with this review i give this movie a \"Rent\" 3 out of 5.",

All this movie does is take plot devices and conventions from the first film and recycle them MULTIPLE TIMES and they try to rationalize it into a significant plot. The thing that is most frustrating about this movie is that it doesn't focus on any one character. It focuses on several people having the same delusions that Donnie had and it just makes it feel cheap and not unique. You would think since the they brought back Deveigh Chase from the first film that Donnie's sister would be the focus, but she isn't at all, she is has equal screen time as about 3 other cliched characters. The only thing I like about this movie is the small homages it pays to the first film, and even those are cheap. The movie should have focused on Iraq Jack, cuz at least he somewhat resembled Donnie.

            "content": "The indie cult classic \"Donnie Darko\" was an ingenious, imaginative tale about teenage angst incorporated with time travel, schizophrenia, and devotion. Darko Spoiler Alert! Darko Spoiler Alert! Darko Spoiler Alert! OK, enough. Donnie dies in \"Donnie Darko\" in his free-will time travel flight to deviate the powers of destiny. Well, time has passed since Donnie Darko's closed chapter. So I am dumfounded why the powers that don't see, decided to visit the Darko sequel side. \"S. Darko\" follows the travels of Donnie's younger sister Samantha in an incongruous, insubstantial way. There was no reason to play it again with Sam! Daveigh Chase does play it again portraying Samantha. But this time she is not the bratty 10 year-old she was in \"Donnie Darko\". Samantha is portrayed in \"S. Darko\" in her late teens as an adventure-seeking drifter doing some road trip time travel of her own with her BFF Corey. Their car breaks down in a small rural town, and before you can say \"here comes another rabbit test\", the infamous \"Frank the Bunny\" appears, but not in the same surreal way as in the original Darko. Only his loose head appears in this sequel and becomes an earmark symbol within the strange ordeals that occur in the rural town. Director Chris Fisher and Screenwriter Nathan Atkins try to reincorporate all the original Donnie Darko elements in \"S. Darko\" but to no avail. The Atkins diet of light scribing and the Fisher direction of bait-less audience man-trappings was a Darko catastrophic event that should have been put in a time machine to avoid this cinematic monstrosity. \"Donnie Darko\" Director Richard Kelly wanted no hand in this sequel and one can see why Kelly shied away, and probably furious upon witnessing the cinematic crime of \"S. Darko\". Let's now take a little ride in my movie review time travel machine and go back to the \"S. Darko\" plot (sorry!): Samantha & Corey suddenly come into contact with the small-towners as if they were significant fixtures of their past which includes the archetypical: cool guy, nerdy science guy, hypocritical priest, quirky hotel manager, ruthless cop, and maniacal young veteran. The ensemble acting of \"S. Darko\" also did unfortunately demonstrate the dark side of abysmal thespianism, with only Chase as Sam and Elizabeth Berkley as religious zealot Trudy giving mediocre turns. Donnie Darko is probably rolling in his time-machine grave in witnessing the dummy darko of \"S. Darko\". \r\n* Failure",

There are no unicorns in Donnie Darko. Sure this is \"S\" Darko, but they copied everything else. And they made Jeremy randomly turn evil at the end? Seriously. And what was up with his rash? That sure wasn't developed much. It seemed to me they just wanted to add some more \"freakiness\" and let the makeup artists have fun creating crap. Even ignoring Donnie Darko, this film sucked. Especially actually, since it would have made even lesser sense, but then again it wouldn't be so predictable, which is the antithesis of Donnie Darkoness. The characters were so random and pointless, most likely just to incorporate some more eye candy actors, which are the only reason to watch the movie, if I should be so shallow to say.

This was slightly better than expected, but still fell short of being a decent film.\r\n\r\nOn a postive note, the cinematography was superb.  Outstanding even.  The score was also first class, probably better than Donnie even.  Sadly it fell short in other more important areas, such as empathy for the characters, decent acting and the fact it was too similar to Donnie.  It tried to be too serious.  It tried to out-Donnie Donnie.  Donnie had a great humourous edge to it.  This was more like the film equivalent of a morgue.  Many things didnt make sense.  What was the point of the jesus loving lady?  Or the Donnie Darko rabbit mask?\r\n\r\nWhilst it had its good points, as a whole it can be added to the list of dissapointing sequels.

There were  some plot holes, and points that needed a bit more detail to understand aspects as a whole, it was trying as bit too hard, but, like DD, it had a good cinematographic  feel in some aspects, but, not all.  I guess i found this to be the middle of the road. Probably only good if you are a fan of DD. Alot of it is recalling in vague ways major plot points in DD, thinks you'll only understand if you are very familiar with DD>",

Darko picks up 7 years after the end of Donnie Darko, and his younger sister, Samantha (played once more by Daveigh Chase), is encountering her own alternate reality, only this time she is a manipulated dead (taking the 'Frank' role) guiding a washed out ex-soldier to stop the world from ending.  Pretty much more of the same as last time around, with little attempts at referencing the original by way of names (there is a Frank who runs a garage, and the soldier is surnamed Sparrow... linking with Roberta Sparrow who wrote about time travel in the first), as though that will somehow lift the mess above the level it is at.  It doesn't!  The film attempts to blatantly rip off key moments from Donnie, such as 'burn it to the ground', or poorly concieved reasons for rabbit shaped masks, but seems to do it just for the sake of reference rather than having any point of purpose to the story.  One of the most memorable moments in the first film was the 'Head Over Heels' introduction to the school, beginning with a spiral shot away from a school bus, and then following Donnie through the school halls.  What made this scene so special was not just the music, or the 'fast-slow' direction, but the fact that it used 2 minutes of shot to introduce all the key characters in Donnie's school life without any dialogue, but in such a way that we know everything we need to know about their personalities.  Well, in S.Darko a similar shot is used to walk through a party, but for no reason of introduction of character, simply just to rip off an iconic scene.  Throw in someone jumping on a trampoline, and it is at this point that you realise this film is offering nothing new, no build on the original at all.\r\n\r\nAs a standalone film the story makes little to no sense.  Donnie Darko at least was written by Kelly with a definite idea as to what was happening and why, even if it doesn't quite explain everything.  All the clues were there if you dug down into examining every scene.  With this film it seems to be deliberately written to make no sense at all, and the time manipulation used throughout is weak and unexplainable.  As for the resolution (which sees another rip-off moment as we see the lives of those affected throughout played past in slow motion to music), it leaves no hint of resolution, or teases of ideas for you to care about.  So, on its own merits this film is badly written, as a sequel it is diabolically bad!  Donnie Darko had you leaving the theatre caring about what you saw, and trying to formulate an idea about what occurred.  S.Darko has you wondering what else you can watch to take your mind off it!\r\n\r\nIf this film has any use it is in allowing us to re-examine Donnie Darko and realise exactly how well made the film was.  It even allows those who were not enamoured with Southland Tales to perhaps see that film in a different light, as compared to this Richard Kelly's second film was a work of art!  This was always going to be a tough sell of a film, as a sequel to such a cult success.  Perhaps they should have renamed the lead character and attempted no link with Donnie.  At least then it would just be a straight-to-DVD piece of trash, as opposed to one which tried to latch itself onto the coat-tails of greatness.",

It focuses around her and her best friend when their car breaks down in Podunktown U.S.A.  There they meet the confident cool guy, the sarcastic police officer, the insane war veteran and other stock characters.  The rest is all an imitation of themes of the original; rabbit masks, water-air and apocalypse predictions.  There are two things that really took me out of the movie, and that is the very bad acting and some of the special effects.  I know it's direct-to-DVD, but that's no excuse not to place forth an effort in acting.  Granted, they are given lots of bad dialogue to deliver, but still.  Ed Westwick as the cool kid was the sorest thumb of the bunch for me.  Some of the CGI effects look very out of place; the photography is actually much better than you would expect, and director Chris Fisher should have more confidence in that so that he wouldn't have to fall back on such fake looking effects.  Lots of scenes feel like music videos, and he is probably a really good music video director, just not a good movie director.

And just like \"Midnight Movie\", \"S. Darko\" suffers from the same fate.  It sucks.  It sucks epically.  It sucks so bad, it's almost painful.  The worst part is that this is supposed to be a sequel to \"Donnie Darko\".  I don't even want to call it a sequel to \"Donnie Darko\", because every time I do it kills me inside.  How could this piece of crap be a sequel to the cult classic?  It hurts me to think about it.\n\nIt isn't widely known that \"Donnie Darko\" was destined to be a straight to DVD movie.  I bet a lot of people who didn't know that are probably thinking, \"Whoa, really?\".  But yeah, it's true.  \"Donnie Darko\" was originally intended to head straight to DVD.  So you can imagine my thought-process going into \"S. Darko\".  I figured \"Hey, 'Donnie Darko' was gonna go straight to DVD, so why not give 'S. Darko' a chance? It might turn out great!\".  Wrong.  Dead wrong.\n\nEssentially every aspect of the original film is reduced, reused, and recycled in \"S. Darko\".  The creepy bunny?  Reused.  The liquid spears coming out of people's bodies? Recycled.  The twisty ending? Reused (TWICE! TWICE IN THE SAME MOVIE! ARGH!).  The message and the character developent? Reduced and reused.  I honestly feel like I could list EVERYTHING from Donnie Darko and it would somehow appear in this... bastardized film.  If you're going to make a sequel to a movie, why is it necessary to reuse so so so much of it?  Thankfully, they didn't just revert to using clips of the first movie.  I understand a sequel should rely on some aspects of the original (in terms of storyline, characters, etc. etc.) but it's really not enjoyable to watch this movie when so much of it feels ripped from the first.  There's nothing really original offered here.  The closest we get to something novel would be the more heavy handed religious aspects and the sub-plot involving a creepy pedophile priest (yet even that is ripped from the first, considering the whole sub-plot of the child porn ring).\n\nThere really is nothing in this movie worth checking out.  The gist of the movie is that Samantha Darko (Donnie Darko's little sister) is all grown up and rebelling against her family by running away from home with her extremely skanky best friend.  The two end up in some backwards town on their way to California and decide to shack up there because there's \"gonna be a house party\" at some guy's house.  Who the hell decides to live in a town for an extended period of time in order to attend a house party with a bunch of strangers?  I guess it was just the director's excuse to include a house party scene (once again reused from the original! Ugh!).  From there on, it pretty much just continues in the tradition of the original, except the girls sleepwalk around town so frequently it becomes absolutely ridiculos.  There must have been at least 4 or 5 instances where the girls stumble around town in their shorty shorts and barely there tank tops.  In all instances they hardly arouse a twitter from the locals.  I guess they must be used to half-nude ladies wandering the lonely streets of their quiet little town at 3AM.  Eventually there's a whole double sacrifice thingy, where both girls end up dying for the sake of each other (or something along those lines) until eventually the town nutjob/essential bunny suit man goes back in time to save both of these little twits.  The end. Yawn.\n\nBefore I end this ranting rampage, I have to mention how HORRIBLE the director/writer of this movie is (Chris Fisher... fucking asshole of Hollywood).  The script is laughable.  It sounds like a bunch of stoners having a pseudo \"deep\" conversation.  Example: \"I wonder what God's farts taste like?  Marshmallow Peeps?\"  I did some research and it turns out Chris Fisher is best known for director episodes of crappy TV shows like Cold Case or Moonlight, and for writing the scripts for movies about serial killers and gang-bangers.  Wonderful.  I'm not sure how a guy who once wrote a script involving gang-bangers  and directed a movie about a notorious rapist  was hired to write/direct the sequel to a cult classic coming of age horror film.  I guess they're giving anyone the right to ruin the classics these days so long as they have the ability to use a laptop and hammer out a script that's not even worthy to wipe your ass with.",

It gives you the reverse side of things from Donnie Darko, Sam is the manipulated dead instead of the manipulated living.  I also believe that this film will attract a younger audience to the original so that's a good thing.  \r\n\r\nThat being said, it does have its problems, this one isn't near as slick as the original or thought provoking, it's just a re-hashing of the same ideas the original presented.  You can tell that it didn't have near as much budget as the original as well from the very first frame.  And it certainly deserved a much larger budget.  However, I believe that the director did the best he could with what he was given and I have to give him some props for that, saying that if I were a director I would have never taken this movie.   \r\n\r\nAll in all, I have to say that I did enjoy this movie and that fans of the original should probably give this one a look, at least a rental.

It had great potential, and definitely left one guessing like D Darko, but it was too jumbled together. Too much going on and not enough explaining. For instance, one of the main characters in the movie goes looking for Samantha Darko at her hotel room as the 'world is ending', he shortly gives up and the movie jumps scenes, shortly later the character shows up on a hilltop many miles away where Samantha is, promptly picks her up off the ground and exits stage right. No explanations. It's OK though, the movie reverses it's self several times and has several 'main' characters that have a very limited involvement in the film. There's is hardly any character development for several of the characters, so there's is none of the connections that D Darko enabled the viewer to form with the characters. There is frequent use of the various fundamentally Darko elements (the bunny, wormholes, time travel, strange sleep-walking scenes) but that is all that connects it to the Darko movie and the only elements that I think give any quality to this film at all. It was just not thought out very well, and definitely not filled out well.The tone of the movie is also drastically different than that of the first.\nI did not like it at all.\n\n\n\"There must be something that connects Donnie and Samantha.\" -actual line from the movie.\n\nI don't see anything other than a name.",

The music was fantastic and themed for the time-frame in the movie like the first one.  The cinematography is great.  The story-line is interesting.  The more I watch it, the more I like it.  It's definitely a completely different animal than the first one.  Not as mysterious and enjoyable to me.  I thought many of the performers were good.  But overall I did not like it.  If you are watching it and thinking of it in the same universe as 'Donnie' it might be hard to swallow.  The movie itself really makes Donnie's Death meaningless.  And honestly the story itself in 'S. Darko'  was kind of meaningless too.  I would view it as a 'fanfilm' because that's kind of also how it came across.  Maybe it deserves a half star more, I'm a little on the fence.  At least they got the same actress to play Sam.  And they used the time travel book and followed the same rules.  ALSO: To The Admins of Flixter.  Justin Chatwin is NOT in this movie!!!! Why is he listed in the cast?  I hope to see it changed soon",

Darko: A Donnie Darko Tale has a completely different vibe to it compared to the original movie Donnie Darko.  \r\nFrom the original movie, the main character Donnie had a somewhat super hero attitude feel to it; while the second movie is more of a fairy tale; dealing with the main character Samantha.  Even the creators (who are fans of the first movie) say that the second movie is more of a ?continuation? rather than a ?true sequel.?\r\nSince the two movies are based in two different time periods (1988 and 1995) and also two different main characters; it is to be expected that they are not going to feel the same.  \r\nI personally admire the hard efforts that the people who had created this movie.  I also hope to see another continuation within the universe of Donnie Darko by either the original creators, the people who made the second installment, and/or by more fans of the original movie who want to expand the world of Donnie Darko.\r\nMy closing comments: The footage that they shot in Utah is beautiful, the movie is a little more simplex compared to the original, but for people who never saw the original movie and don?t really care to watch a movie that wants to make people think might become more easily hooked with this movie rather than the first movie.",

There's enough content on this movie to contemplate and decode for some time to come (it's been years since seeing the first Darko movie and I still think about it from time to time).\r\n\r\nI think I would really like to go back and watch both back-to-back as there's information revealed in the first film which is referenced in the second.  I don't think you can really appreciate either film without looking reading some of the background material, checking out the websites, and spending a little time comprehending the mythos in the Darko universe.  \r\n\r\nPersonally, I would LOVE to see a prequel to these movies covering the creation of the Philosophy of Time Travel book and what led granny Sparrow to help set all these events in motion.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to those who said S. Darko was bad are probably just negative people who like to whine about everything haha..... (j/k)",

Also, the main character this time around was one of the Manipulated Dead\n\nOverall, not only did it not suck as bad as I was expecting, but it also was actually pretty good.

Darko, the story of Donnie's sister that picks up 7 years later.  Now, while the movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it was still awful;  the time-travel angles that were so brilliant in the first film are repetitive and nonsensical in this film, the inclusion of Frank the Bunny in this film seems blasphemous to the first film in this context, and the number of times the characters manage to perish and then come back makes you not really care for anyone in the film.  I'll give the film a little bit of credit for having twists in the story that I did not expect and I truly believe that the director was trying to reach for some really fantastic concepts, but ended up falling miserably flat.  Just because a really bad idea doesn't end up as terrible as you expected doesn't really make the bad idea any better.",

            "content": "Take the masterpiece that is 'Donnie Darko,' and place the entire film in front a mirror.  What do you get?  For some reason, you get ' s. Darko'... Not making sense?  Well, neither does this movie.  I cannot imagine a more thorough job of tarnishing the reputation of an awesome film.  This may get a bit wordy, so I'll just begin with the simple things.  \r\n\r\nActing.  I felt for a minute like I was watching some typical teenage-horror flick rivaling the cheesiness of the 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' series... then I considered the script.  After carefully analyzing this aspect, I had to move s. Darko a little below the teenage-horror flick level to which I previously referred.  The writing was complete garbage.  Donnie Darko thrived by using a perfect mix of deep, eccentric characters along with stereotypical fill-ins responsible for playing specific roles to assist in efficiently conveying the movie's point.  s. Darko, on the other hand, decided to fill the movie with a ridiculously higher number of these predictable 'fill-in' types and (for some reason) decided to make these the STARS of the movie.  No real issues were addressed with the dialogue in s. Darko besides the shallow bickerings of the ignorant high-school characters who go through a slew of typical social situations that have nothing to do with what SHOULD BE the point of the movie.  (Well, not according to Deveigh Chase, who stupidly remarks that the movie is about 'teenage girls learning and growing as people' in the movie's commentary... but we won't get into that yet.)  While the dialogue completely excludes the real point of the movie, it also adds in a bunch of pseudo-relevant crap about Christianity that leads to a subplot involving a perverted pastor and obsessive follower that play no real role in the story whatsoever.  (Besides slandering the name of Iraq Jack)  I'm going to move on now since I could go on forever criticizing the unintelligent trash heap s. Darko calls a script. \r\n\r\nNow getting to the camera-work... I'm definitely not an expert about the filming of movies, but pretty much the most important action scene in the entire movie was an utter failure.  I am, of course, referring to the accident that kills either Samantha or Corey.  When Corey dies, the accident is fine, because it's a simple concept of one car running into another and killing the girl in the passenger seat - we don't need actual visuals to understand this.  However, when Samantha dies, we see a crappy picture of a car running into another, (just the impact site... about 3 square feet in the frame) and then we see Samantha somehow lying behind the car whose passenger side was hit.  This, of course, makes no sense, as the car that was hit would have to have run head-on into Samantha, leading her to flip over the top and land on her back behind this car.  If this were the case, then the car that was hit would need to have hit Samantha before being hit itself.  That would be fine too, since the driver was drinking, but we are later told that nothing was that driver's fault, that the other car came out of nowhere, and that this other car was somehow the cause of Samantha's death.  See how hard this is for me to explain with words?  Yeah, an actual visual of the crash would have been nice.\r\n\r\nAt this point, nothing about the movie has been great, but to be honest, the acting, script, and filming don't NEED to be great in a movie like Donnie Darko - it's all about the idea being portrayed.  The people making this film were clearly a bunch of idiot fanboys who never really understood Donnie Darko in the first place.  I've already mentioned the actress who plays Samantha not having a clue what the movie was about (none of the actors/actresses seemed to have a clue), but after watching the commentary from the makers of the film, it's clear that they were clueless as well.  First of all, the movie begins by telling us that the story of Donnie Darko was 'just the BEGINNING of the story and the mystery.'  Unfortunately, the makers of s. Darko decided that this 'beginning' needed to be done again (poorly) without adding anything new.  The first Donnie Darko was pretty cut and dry about what needed to be represented when and where to look for clues in the case that we needed them.  The ambiguity in s. Darko is insane.  Since nothing is explained, we're left to assume that:\r\n\r\n1.  The meteor shower toward the end of the movie represents the same Universal collision represented by the storm in Donnie Darko.\r\n2.  The meteor rock causes the rash that the nerdy guy (and later the motel owner) had... and this rash causes some sort of personality change?\r\n3.  The children in the mine never get rescued no matter what happens?\r\n\r\nIn the commentary offered by the filmmakers, they (sort of) stated their intentions.  Samantha was meant to be the opposite of Donnie as far as her wants/needs.  Donnie was afraid of death, but had to face that death in order to save his universe.  Apparently, Samantha is afraid of LIVING, so she has to live instead of die.  For some dumb reason, the makers decided to settle on this concept, but it's obvious that they ran into a real rut.  This was never addressed by the makers, who said that they wanted to raise questions/mysteries in the film that don't get answered... which is just a lazy way of saying they wanted to throw some 'mysterious' garbage in there that makes the movie seem cool but doesn't actually make sense.  But, getting to their rut... (we'll need a new paragraph for this)\r\n\r\nIn order to stay in tune with Donnie Darko, you can't just mirror the entire concept of the movie and expect it to work.  Donnie had a reason to avoid that jet engine - to live.  Frank (the 'living dead') helped him accomplish this, and that lead to the end.  In s. Darko, the makers WANTED Samantha's death to lead to the end, but this doesn't work, since Samantha would not be alive to time travel and save herself.  So, the makers decided to just make Samantha the living dead (now the living dead is just another character in the movie?!) who saves Iraq Jack.  Clearly, this makes no sense given that Samantha didn't even know Iraq Jack at the time, nor did she have any reason to want him left alive.  So now, the makers thought, \"so now Samantha has to die somehow as a result of Iraq Jack's living to do what we wanted to do... but we can't have Iraq Jack be the time traveler because then he would pretty much be the main character in the movie and play the part of 'Donnie.'\"\r\n\r\nThis is where things got complicated.  (and screwed up)  In the original Donnie, it was clearly shown that his death was all that needed to happen to save the universe.  In s. Darko, Iraq Jack needed to technically live AND die for this to work!  Because the movie made so much of it about the social learnings/relationships of the girls, Iraq Jack's dying would not have  had any impact on the fate of the universe without him living first.  Since Iraq Jack needed to live and then die for everything to work out, his living didn't really trigger to end of the Universe... suddenly the count-down was inaccurate and the entire fate of the universe was dependent on the irrelevant co-star (Corey).  In the end, Corey needed to time travel, (which she somehow figured out in a second... completely different from Donnie Darko) and she became the REAL trigger that saved the Universe.  Just to make the story still have something to do with Samantha, the makers had to make her play the 'intermediate' role of time traveling herself to let Iraq Jack die.  So in the end, it was all about Corey dying... but Corey wasn't signaled by a living dead character like Frank, she was signaled by some kidnapped kid stuck in a mine shaft!  Once again, they just decided to take a random character and make this character represent the living dead.  The problem with this is that there was no signal in the film to show that any difference in the past ever changed the fate of these kids.  Had this been shown in some way, the movie might have made a little more sense. (but not much, since we're now really stretching with our assumptions)  To make things more clearly understood, here are the possible scenarios playing out through the movie:\r\n\r\n1.  Iraq Jack dies originally - in this case, Sam never learns anything, and neither does Corey.  The church doesn't burn down... but then again, what did the church have to do with the story anyway?  Both Corey and Sam stay in town, and the Universe (probably) ends anyway.  (assuming there's only one way everything works out and that involves Sam leaving town because she's learned from later experiences)  In this case, we really don't have any clue what might have happened.\r\n\r\n2.  Iraq Jack lives originally and Samantha dies - the end.\r\n\r\n3.  Iraq Jack lives originally and Corey dies - go to scenario 4.\r\n\r\n4.  Iraq Jack lives AND dies (ridiculous) - the Universe is saved.\r\n\r\nOverall, the makers of s. Darko just wanted to make a mirror copy of Donnie Darko and struggled to throw together a bunch of extra assumptions and crap that makes no sense just to make their unnecessary ideas work.  The entire plot was ambiguous just to protect the mistakes of the filmmakers.  Since s. Darko was simply a mirror image of Donnie Darko, I decided to mirror Donnie's star rating as well.  One big HALF STAR for the disaster that is 's. Darko.'",

The rules, the images and even the plot of the first are recycled to serve the sequel, and this does not produce a fan-pleasing result.\n\nWhen I saw the trailer, I wondered, \"What could this movie possibly be about?\" I thought perhaps the movie studio had cast another 10-year-old Samantha Darko who we would possibly follow on her plane ride into the black hole that opened at the end of [u]Donnie Darko[/u].  I saw all sorts of possibilities in what might lie beyond that black hole.  Could such a sequel be done without the original actors if they were necessary?  Maybe if it were animated.\n\n[u]S. Darko:  A Donnie Darko Tale[/u] instead presents multiple bubble universes similar to the single one of [u]Donnie Darko[/u], this time introduced through the emergence of a meteorite, composed of a metal that is alien to the periodic table.  Unlike in [u]Donnie Darko[/u], however, it is unclear to me how the events that unfold in the sequel bring about the introduction of the alien metal into our universe.  Per Sam's quote above that she wished she could switch places with someone else, events in one bubble universe seemingly affect events in another, such as her dying in another's place.\n\nBut the movie becomes rather incoherent from there, similar to the devolution of the plot of the movie L[u]ife Force[/u] when the alien entity in that film mentally invades Dr. Armstrong's body.  The second bubble universe presented in [u]S. Darko:  A Donnie Darko Tale[/u] is destroyed by a tesseract shower, and a troubled Gulf War veteran in the film, Iraq Jack, sacrifices himself in order to save our world from the same fate.  Long before this point in the plot, any viewer who has not seen [u]Donnie Darko[/u] would be lost to what is going on, and even I find myself asking now, \"How does Iraq Jack's sacrifice save our world?\"  I'm at a loss to explain.\n\nBy watching this film, I have decided that parallel universes can be a really fun topic to base a movie or series around (e.g. [u]Sliders[/u]), but while [u]S. Darko:  A Donnie Darko Tale[/u] plays around with the mythos of its predecessor, the inclusion of the characters Samantha Darko and the grandson of Roberta Sparrow, the rules of  [u]Donnie Darko[/u] and pretty much a recycled version of the plot of [u]Donnie Darko[/u] were unnecessary for this sequel.  I think it would be far more interesting to present an alternate, parallel Earth to our own where new rules and an innovative plot are presented rather than slavishly attempting to produce something new from the aftermath of [u]Donnie Darko[/u].  The failure of this movie is somewhat analogous to the failure of the film [u]Cube 2:  Hypercube[/u].",

It gets a little complicated because the filmmakers create a 2nd Tangent Universe (with different characters representing the Manipulated Dead and Living Receiver roles). The plot is essentially the same though -- a \"Donnie\" character (here played by James Lafferty of \"One Tree Hill\") is saved from death in order to save the world. The problem is we don't really see as much of him as we should. There are some tie-ins to the first film, i.e. a mechanic named Frank. One problem I had was the sister possesses Donnie's book on time travel, which shouldn't be the case since, technically, he received it in a Tangent Universe -- and died in the Primary Universe.",

Know this, it's a different cast, different director, so this is pretty much only connected with the first movie via lame light references or the beginning little paragraph explaining the first film before starting this one up. While the story follows the same mind fuck pattern of decisions, time travel, and odd other tid bits, its just soooo damn generic and lazy compared to the first. There is no reason this movie should have ever happened, and as much as I hoped this was going to be at least decent, this is indeed one of the reasons why sequels do not work when the source material was not even suited for sequels in the first place. This is not the worst movie ever or even the worst movie of the year but seriously, what the fuck did I just watch it was like a rehashed half assed version of the first only worse in nearly every single way. Complicated for the sake of being complicated and vague, it is so obviously trying to be different and mind twisting like the first film but it totally isn't, and is insulting at times as much as it is a homage to donnie darko...\r\n\r\nThe only glimmer of hope that I had for this thing was when a couple unexpected events occured, but they are totally overshadowed by the lame writing and sub par directing and performances so you can't even really give the movie too many points for that.",

            "content": "What's the most ridiculous thing you can imagine happening in a Donnie Darko sequel? Is it Elizabeth Berkley walking around with a book called Jesusonomy? That (and much more) happens in S. Darko, a direct-to-DVD sequel to Richard Kelly's 2001 cult fave. It's more like a spinoff than a sequel. The closest thing I can compare it to is Walter Murch's Return to Oz, which used some of the same characters from The Wizard of Oz but felt completely alien to the spirit of the original.\n\nAs the title suggests, S. Darko concerns Donnie's kid sister, Samantha (Daveigh Chase). Seven years have passed since her brother's death (the film is set in 1995). Sam has run away from her home in Middlesex, Virginia, and set off for Hollywood. This backstory is explained in a ludicrous epilogue that I can't resist quoting from: Sam is \"seemingly alone and lost in the world.\" She's \"drowning in sadness and unable to dream.\" Oh, and \"when darkness consumes the starlight, nightmares rule the night.\" Is this movie for real or what?\n\nSam and her bitchy friend Corey (Briana Evigan) get sidetracked on the way to Hollywood and end up in a bumfuck town in Utah. There, she learns the world will end in 4 days, 17 hours, 26 minutes and 31 seconds. In a place like this, the end can't come soon enough.\n\nJust like that doomsday countdown, there are other \"quotes\" from the original. Roberta Sparrow's grandson, Iraq Jack (James Lafferty), says \"they made me do it\" (a phrase Donnie scrawled on the pavement after vandalizing his school). There's a character named Frank (as in Frank the Giant Bunny Rabbit). A portal opens up in an empty movie theater. Time travel plays a big part, as does Roberta Sparrow's book, The Philosophy of Time Travel. And so on. If you think the experience of watching a Donnie Darko sequel made without Kelly's blessing might feel slightly sacrilegious, you wouldn't be half wrong.\n\nThe original inspired fierce love and passionate debate. I used to watch it about once a week, and with each viewing, I felt like the puzzle pieces would add up to something even more profound than the conclusions I'd drawn the last time. S. Darko inspires nothing but confusion; it's disjointed and meaningless. It has missing kids, ghosts, a car crash, scenes that double back on themselves -- but none of it connects. It's an insult to Richard Kelly's intelligence.\n\nOn the plus side, the film features some witty casting. Chase is the same little girl from the original, now all grow'd up. It's funny to see Berkley (from Showgirls) looking all churchy and self-righteous. Lensing, scoring and FX work are all top-notch. See it if you must, but for me this story ended when David waved at Gretchen in the street at the end of the original -- the ultimate hello and goodbye.",

The characters in the first film did have a dark side but had a certain charm that made them interesting. It's the exact opposite in this film.

In many ways, it's another version of Donnie Darko, only without explanations or any sense of connection.  Donnie Darko is brilliantly played out; this is not.  \n\nOutside of its connection with Donnie Darko, there are other things. The acting is awful, the storyline is a mess, and the dialogue is some of the worst I've heard from any movie (the taste of farts? What the hell?). The entire thing is all over the place.

There's a hell of a lot going on under the surface that you're really going to miss unless you pay attention.  \n\nI liked the acting, the special effects, the cinematography.  I really just loved this movie.  I saw the short clip about the kid who disappears and how he disappears, which was kind of a cool added bonus.\n\nAnd as for everyone hating this movie because it is not Donnie Darko, just get over it.  Donnie Darko was a great movie.  I don't think this one took away anything from that.  Not sure why liking this one means you can't like Donnie Darko...  \n\n**** and now for HELLA SPOILERS**** don't read this if you haven't seen it.  Iraq Jack has to die in order to restore balance to the world.  Everyone dies if he doesn't.  \n\nAlso as for the meteor shower at the end, this is what I read \"The \"meteorite\" shower was pieces of the hypercube/tesseract from the fourth dimension. If Iraq Jack (who happens to be Robert Sparrow's grandson) dies and the tangent is fixed, the corruption in the fourth dimension construct would be fixed, and the tesseract shouldn't appear in the primary universe. I think.\"  \n\nAs for the Phoenix.  \"The Phoenix is the keeper of new separate universe.  This is where the feather comes in.  The feather represents new life.\"  Also if you didn't catch it from the quotes about the priest \"having to protect the children\".  He was the pedophile killing the kids.  Also the key to the lock comes from the bracelet he gave to Trudy.\n\nAs for the water bottle people are asking about;  You need water and metal to travel through time.  The mine was metal.  The water bottle... was ... water...\n\nOne possible mistake: \"Samantha has the book? Donnie never had it on the Primary Universe. So he never did that drawing on it.\"",

Never in this film did I feel inquisitive as I did in Donnie Darko and while the film had extra twists and wasn't bad, the fact that it was considered a sequel to such a great movie as Donnie Darko is rather offensive to me. The director should have used his story line and done something similar to Donnie Darko rather than failing at making a sequel.\n\nBasically to me this is like artists trying to remake classic songs with a new rap beat.  If it's not broke, don't fix it. If it's not a book series, don't make a sequel to an already great film.",

When the credits begin to roll, you will also be extremely irritated that you wasted 103 minutes of your life. You will wish you could unsee what you just watched! I knew all about how terribly this film was reviewed and expected very little. Even if I had never seen Donnie Darko and knew nothing of it's connections, it would still be a monumental failure. There are many problems with this movie, but I will save my criticism to the 3 most frustrating. 1st...horrible acting. One of the greatest things about Donnie Darko was seeing great performances out of rarely seen actors/actresses. S Darko showed that poorly written characters + horrible acting= epic failure. 2nd...pointless storyline. What was the point of this movie?? Donnie Darko figuratively transported me inside the movie with it's captivating storyline. Even though I was left with questions at the end of Donnie Darko, I was not asking \"why did I waste my time watching this?\" 3rd...awful soundtrack. Something I love about Donnie Darko is how well the soundtrack assisted in the telling of the story and the emotions it was meant to induce. S Darko had an anemic soundtrack in comparison. Multiple times during the movie I found myself actually thinking \"why are they playing this music right now?\" A final note (even though he didn't have much to work with), Chris Fisher should stick to directing TV.",

This ABOMINATION almost devalues the original - a great film.  Many straight-to-video sequels to great films have had the same effect of awfulness over the years.  This is no different.  Please don't see this movie if you like Donnie Darko, because if you do your memory of it will be tarnished.  I was drinking while watching it, and every trip to the bathroom I kept thinking \"God this movie is bad\" and then went back to my seat to my horror that I was STILL WATCHING IT!  If I wasn't one to see things through, no matter how bad it is, I would have turned it off after the first half hour.  AND I REALIZE NOW I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED ANYTHING!  How could fans of Donnie Darko have made such a terrible movie?  Simple answer - THEY HAVE NO TALENT!",

WOW it surpassed anything I was expecting.\r\n The story in this follows Samantha Darko played by Daveigh Chase from the first movie as she is dealing with the death of Donnie and the neglect from her parents following Donnie's death. We learn how rough of a time she had and that she attempted suicide a coupple times. The movie picks up where her and her friend are on a road trip going to LA. There car breaks down in a small town and events start happening like in the original. However this tells the story from the manipulated dead's point of view. In the first movie Donnie was the reciver and Frank was the manipulated dead. This story has Samantha being the Manipulated dead and a new character Iraq Jack (played by James Lafferty) who has a closer connection to the original that we might first think. All in all this was actually a really good movie which is going to get hatred simply beacause it's a sequal to Donnie Darko. Although I wouldn't even say it's a sequal more of a continuation.

Sure enough, one of the residents is experiencing the same exact stuff as Donnie, only his Frank the Bunny is Samantha who communicates to him in the same voice in an alternate universe. This film is total rubbish. Though it has excellent direction from Chris Fisher, the story is so blatantly a rehash of the same stuff we saw in the original, that it almost seems criminal. Hey guys, I got an idea! Instead of an airplane engine, lets use a meteor (Yes, the steal the ending from the original). Hey, and instead of a flashy sequence of kids and adults mingling in a school environment to the soundtrack of classic 80's music, let's do the same thing, only at a party and with terrible D-grade mid-90's rock. This is a HUGE rip-off film. Also, it insults me when greedy movie-makers cast their films with supermodels in hopes of having viewers not notice the very weak storylines and plotholes. This film was a very clever attempt at making a remake to a new film and calling it a \"sequel\". Awful, awful slap in the face to fans.",

It was a spectacle, something with startling cuts, fast motion, and slo-mo. \r\n\r\nIt's a cut-and-paste collage of bad acting, blatant references to Donnie Darko, and ridiculous dialogue.

Everyone dies at some point in the time warp (Samantha Darko twice, actually).

Is it that stereotyping has taken over good creativity and direction? Or is it just easier for terrible actors/actresses to play those ridiculously regurgitated roles? Watching films like this only remind us of one thing, which is how absolutely rubbish cinema has become.\n\nIf you've heard of 'easily forgettable' films then this would be one, only if it didn't scar the perfectly fine 'Donnie Darko' and make you want to go tear down their studio.

I'm sorry but let me first start by saying that it's almost impossible, no it is impossible to write and direct a sequel to 2001's classic independent film, \"Donnie Darko\", yet the powers that be decided we needed a sequel, cause everything needs a sequel right?\n\nThe thing that amazes me is that they actually got Daveigh Chase, the original actress who played Donnie's sister in the original film, to reprise her role here.  Does that even come close to legitimizing a sequel, no, no it doesn't.  Let's see, for starters, instead of a child pornographer guy getting arrested at the end, this time we have a crazy religious cult in a small town (I believe it was unnamed, but again I was more mesmerized by how terrible this film was), headed by a dude who's nothing more then a man using the Bible to get what he wants, which is young children.  Disturbing, yes, also uncalled for.  Samantha and her friend are on a road trip, perhaps on the run, who really knows, and they end up in this small town where crazy stuff happens.  Oh and by now, if you haven't seen the original, yeah skip this. In fact I think I'm just going to end ranting on this piece of trash now, and I'm just going to tell you that if you've never seen \"Donnie Darko\", go rent it and give it a shot, it's an amazing film.  It may take you more then one viewing to understand everything, but that film was awesome.  This, however, is just a cheap cash in on a good film. Don't bother.

The production values are actually quite good, so it's at least watchable. Daveigh Chase and Briana Evigan are quite convincing in their roles (but everyone else in the film is terrible). It doesn't _look_ like a crappy little independent project (though the CG is pretty poor). On the plus side, the soundtrack is full of 90's nostalgia, which at least parallels the 80's nostalgia Donnie Darko was full of.\n\nIt fails to however, to resurrect the dark, brooding feel of its predecessor. The plot is also riddled with so many holes that it's completely incoherent. In fact, the story just makes no damn sense. Unlike the cleverly symmetrical puzzle pieces of Donnie Darko, S. Darko is just a clumsy, fumbled together mismatch of pieces. To make matters, the story is incredibly uninspired, and the plot is annoyingly similar to that of the first film. Not similar in the sense that it pays tribute to it, or that it is a continuity of it (which it should have been, and could easily have been, but most certainly was not); it's merely a poor imitation.\n\nSo I say to fans, it's worth a look if you're really, REALLY curious... but this is pretty much bad as can be.",

That and I'm a sucker for franchises. \n\nNeedless to say I did not have high expectations for \"S. Darko\", being as it was straight to video and the complexity and 'have to watch it a billion times to even catch everything' side of the first film, this was going to be a long shot. But, in the end, I was definitely on the pleasantly surprised side of the fence for this one. \n\nFans of the first film (and you HAVE to see it to even begin to crack into this one) are going to find a lot of things to love about this one. It does keep it pretty faithful to the style and approach of \"Donnie\" with its use of music from the era (this time its the 90s!), the slow and fast motion shots and lots of wacky shit, I still can't wrap my mind on what the hell that glowing feather really is, and of course, the rabbit from hell. I was curious to see how they made the rabbit fit in this time as it was so situational specific for \"Donnie\" but without giving away spoilers, they made it work.\n\nAt times, I felt \"S. Darko\" tried almost too hard to be like the first film and it had some almost predictable moments due to that. We know these films have that hidden Sci-Fi time travel aspect, but this time its almost just mushed into the story rather than unraveled out again...(one of my big complaints is that it takes Donnie extensive brain blows to figure out how to make time travel work and yet in this one it seems like child's play and anyone can do it). \n\nBringing back Ms. Chase as S. Darko was a pretty sick move and considering how well she pulled off this film I was thoroughly impressed. as for most of the other parts, they were done well but not to the high expectations this man had. I wanted them to delve more into the Preacher character and explain that sub plot a wee bit more but I understand that they probably didn't have the budget to fully flesh that one out. Otherwise props to Ms. Chase for a job well done.\n\nI have to say that I did enjoy this film quite a bit. Being a \"Donnie Darko\" fan from the beginning (before it blew up and went all Hot Topic and shit!) this did fill my craving for some more wacky hidden Sci Fi work. It was far more clever of a sequel then I was expecting and here's to hoping they make a few more that deliver like this one did!",

Woefully, the execution could've been much better. None of the characters and ideas were fleshed out well enough. I didn't care enough about the characters to grieve their sacrifice; I wasn't moved to tears like I was at the end of Donnie Darko. Some characters were downright annoying and some unbelievable. What was with the geeky meteorite-boy; was he influenced by the space rock or was he always a creep? (BTW - nice Jeff Goldblum impression!)  Recklessly, there were too many characters and storylines tossed around -  and not enough connective plotting to tie everything together like the masterpiece original. I liked some of the subtle references to the first Darko, but others were curiously forced; like the metallic rabbit mask and the Time Travel book. Worst thing of all was the setting was no longer in the magical 80's, so they played 1995 tunes; which took me out of the serious moments.",

They make allusions to the first film, but it's more for the sake of having the audience be like, \"oh, hey, i remember that!\" than having an actual reason for them.\n\nThe dialogue is atrocious. The actors might be reading the script for the first time from cue cards off screen. The plot is ludicrous. This movie just shouldn't exist. Plain and simple. I can't think of another movie more undeserving of a sequel. Let alone a sequel that's just a huge obstrocity.\n\nThe only reason it gets even half of a star is the fact that the Joaquin Phoenix look-alike said a line that reminded me of On a Boat by The Lonely Island, and said another line that reminded me of Optimus Prime from the Transformers cartoon.  Lines I'm talking about:\n\"That's about as real as it gets.\"\n\"I wish I could believe that.\"\n\nAt one point, I was like, \"Oh good, the movie's over.\" But then I checked the time and it was only halfway through.

Yeah, Daviegh Chase resumed her role from the original, and maybe the director WANTED her to act this way, but she basically just irritated me more than anything.  In all honestly, the style used by nearly everyone in this movie could have worked if they just took a little bit more time to nail it... but in the end it just felt rushed.

The idea of showing the film from the point of view of the manipulated dead as opposed to the living receiver is a good one. But apparenlt no matter what you are it's all a load of bollocks. The film is painfully dull and far too serious. Donnie Darko had an expert and hilarious sense of humour. There's no Sparkle Motion or \"Suck a fuck\"'s here. Donnie remained intriguing, due to expertly crafted websites and supplementary material, as well as a complex, but focused screenplay. S.Darko just misses the point, but doesn't even have the decency to be so bad, that's it's disgusting.",

            "content": "*moment of silence* I'm not too sure where I should begin here. I know! I'll start with a question.: \"WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD DONNIE DARKO NEED A SEQUEL!?!?!?!?!?!?\" The way the original Donnie Darko film ended, there was no room or need  for a sequel. How do you have \"a Donnie Darko tale\" without Donnie Darko? This movie, as I'm sure you can tell by the title, is strictly about his younger sister, Samantha. Who cares about what Samantha is doing all these years later? (I KNOW I don't!) Secondly, this film doesn't even have the same director, I was just fine with Richard Kelley's film. Now that I've stated those two reasons, let's look at the other problems with this \"movie\". These other problems are what told me this movie was going to be a waste of my time before I even put in my DVD player. The first thing is pretty obvious, the fact that this movie went straight to DVD is a pretty good sign that it sucks. Secondly, let's look at the fact that two of the cast members, that I know of, are from The CW (James Lafferty from One Tree Hill and Ed Westwick from Gossip Girl). I don't know about everyone else, but the only place that I want to see CW \"actors\" is on the CW. I?m sure this movie was made strictly to get money from the ?die-hard? fans of the original, PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  By now, it should be pretty evident that I'm not a fan of this movie. The only reason that this filth is getting an entire star from me is simply because they didn't take an extra step in the wrong direction and hire a different actress to play the younger sister. Alone, it's just a bad movie, but when you compare it to the original I vomit a little. Donnie Darko was great the way it was, they should have left it alone. I hope this garbage doesn't spawn a bunch of other sequels to other films that ended right the first time. Next, they'll be trying to make a sequel to  Fight Club or Titanic or Taxi Driver...ridiculous!",

The only two things in common were the same producer (Adam Fields, which, you know, means everything) and, although I don't imagine it makes much of a difference, the original Samantha Darko actress (Daveigh Chase).\r\n\r\nTo sell the rights to his masterpiece (Donnie Darko) was an interesting move on Kelly's part though. Usually you'd think that someone would play the concerned artist and bury the rights alongside them in their grave to avoid any unwelcome additions to his beautiful creation. Instead, Kelly sold the rights to the great Chris Fisher, which is actually a clever move considering now he has maybe 20 bucks in his pocket AND he's insured that there will never again be a Donnie Darko spinoff. Just for fun, here's a little bit about Fisher:\r\n   -Fisher is a USC law graduate who went to work as a corporate lawyer in London before deciding    \r\n   to get into the entertainment industry. \r\n   -His resumé boasts directing two episodes of Moonlight (cancelled) and an episode of Chuck    \r\n    (likely to soon be cancelled. \r\n   -He also directed a couple of direct-to-DVD horror movies. \r\n   -He looks like a total douche.\r\n\r\nYes, things can only go well for this movie. \r\n\r\nNow, I can carry on with the review, talk about the strained efforts of the other young actors who you can tell were baited with the thought \"Oh boy! I loved Donnie Darko! This is going to be decent!\" Or I could talk about how the \"writer\" (Nathan Atkins) has an unprecedented IMDB profile by being credited as an editor or sound guy NINE TIMES MORE THAN BEING CREDITED FOR WRITING ANYTHING. Fun fact: Of his writing credit power trio, one is S. Darko, one is a made-for-TV movie (Point of Entry), and the other is a short horror film that he directed. \r\n\r\nBut really, just don't see this film. By giving into your curiosity about what happened afterwards in any movie that you enjoy, you're only creating a market for these abominations to exist. Remember: there are people PROFITING off of things like \"American Pie 8: We Still Have A Closet Full Of Immature Humor To Share With You\" and the animated Star Wars...[I]thing[/I]...that came out a while ago. Please, stand up for consumer rights and just say no. We're counting on you.",

The one thing that bothered me most about this film, was that the director of it recycled a lot of moves the original director used. There where some great new ideas aflot on this one and it is not exactly predicable at all which is obviously a good thing. Of all the new films I've seen so far this year, it is one of the most interesting and if this had been released without the original never existing, it would have been a cult hit for sure. People who have seen Donnie Darko before seeing this, most likely won't buy this one..people going into it without seeing the original just might love it more than this guy.",

Daveigh Chase isn't nearly as good of a lead as Jake Gyllenhaal in Donnie Darko. A huge dissappointment, and just a piece of crap when compared to Donnie. No memorable dialogue in S.
