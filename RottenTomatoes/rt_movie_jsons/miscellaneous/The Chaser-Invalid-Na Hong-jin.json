I'd give it a full five stars if it weren't for two things: one character is badly injured without any explanation and while I admit I don't know anything about Korean criminal procedure, something happens here that I don't think would happen even in the due process obsessed United States.  Don't let that deter you, check this one out.",

My only complaint would be that there were maybe two competing plots each interesting, but instead of coming to a climax at the same time one ending early. It left the last 15 minutes a bit flat as the first of the two was more engaging. Highly recommend for any fans of crime/thrillers, and especially those that are willing to watch or have a liking of foreign films.",

The main theme in this movie which I could really feel was the theme of the incompetence of the police force to solve horrendous crimes. It's a little grounded in existentialism I'd say. It also features a good lead performance by Kim Yoon-Seok. The only problem that I had with this movie is that the subtitles go a little too fast. So sometimes it's hard to follow the details of this movie, which can create a few plot holes. But otherwise, The Chaser is a grim serial killer, thriller pic. I overall enjoyed this movie!

Psycho - Ohh yeah !!\n\nIt is understood that it's not absolutely essential for a movie to attain a closure or to end on a positive note. But when you take that path atleast make the inbetween story development absorbing. Sadly here, for a good 2hr movie, 1.45 hrs is just one way traffic.  The Protagonist wandering in his car aimlessly, Psycho chilling in the police station, Police monkeying around when there's literally a house full of dead bodies, and a guy with previous crime records admitting to 12 murders. There is absolutely no character development in this film; for god sake they had a cop turned pimp worrying about his business well into the second half of the movie !!\n\nHow can a movie be so dreadful inspite of being technically sound ? Answer : Horrible writing !!\nEpic crap. Total bullshit. And what the heck is wrong with these reviewers !! I thought it was a half decent movie given that it's technically good; but the story sucks big time, highly pretentious.",

            "content": "I finished this movie feeling very impressed. It was a patient movie that honestly really surprised me with it's structure. It took turns I was not expecting.\n\nThe story is familiar, but the way it's structured is not at all what you'd expect. This kidnapping/murder thriller goes through a much more realistic (and quite frustrating) path. Filled with infuriating bureaucracy, police incompetence, and just honest bad luck.\n\nAnd in this unusual way of going through a thriller, the cast completely nailed it. From the curious reluctant protagonist, to the comically incompetent police force. Pretty much all the characters in this movie were well acted, and very believable. The main cast was very passionate and interesting to watch. The characters made sense in their actions and motivations, so well played to the writing and the script.\n\nThe movie balanced realistic violence with dramatic violence very well, at times even bringing in comedic violence. It helped create a grounded reality. The main characters weren't superhuman boxers or sprinters, they stumbled, they fell, they were out of breath, they were just regular people in this horrific story.\n\nWhen things got tense, the music got very eerie and suspenseful, loaded the scenes on screen with gravity and tension. Good use of music.\n\nAnother thing I found interesting is the apparent criticism the movie focuses on South Korean police force (and perhaps the politics there). There was a lot of focus on incompetence, on nonsensical decisions, on straight up corruption and willingness to frame in order to get convictions or to appease important politicians. After you get to the story's end, you can feel the anger towards the police force. But I don't know a thing about real life South Korean affairs so there's that too.\n\nDidn't notice any particular cinematographic excellence or originality, it was pretty standard.\n\nAnd finally, the pace of the movie was pretty mellow and patient. It didn't rush from scene to scene, there was a lot of room for breathing and letting every scene run it's course. It felt nice, relaxing even (which is funny, considering the genre).\n\nOVERALL; very competently made movie, well acted, the story surprises and impresses, even explores some pretty interesting issues. It's another quality Korean film in the thriller/crime/drama genre. They know how to do this stuff over there.",

Yun-seok Kim is the outsider \"hero\" who is an ex-cop turned pimp looking for his missing prostitutes; he soon discovers that they may have been murdered by Jung-woo Ha's sick loser.  Or at least Ha confesses that he's done it - but actual evidence is lacking.  Both the (inept) police and Kim then spend most of the movie trying to find bodies, including one girl who may still be alive.  The result is visceral, violent, gritty, suspenseful, downbeat, gruesome, and relentlessly grim.  First time director Hong-jin Na seems to be cribbing from the best source material and the film \"works.\" (Even Melville is evoked in some of the rainy shots through windows - or John Woo's version of Melville - but there isn't as much sensitive masculinity on display here).  However, the themes don't run deep.  Nevertheless, for this genre, it's definitely head and shoulders above the usual crass rip-offs. Check out Memories of Murder (2003) for an even better Korean take on the (incompetent) police procedural.",

There is something about the style of South Korean cinema that is really entrancing for me.  The movie gets going fairly rapidly, and remains tense throughout.  I was emotionally drained after the second half of the movie, with many, many unexpected turns along the way.  The movie really made my jaw drop at times, then as I picked it up...

It is an expert example of a serial-killer film from South Korea, while following his own guidelines. It/s principal chase scene, (one of many), involves a foot race through the deserted narrow nighttime streets of Seoul. There no exploding cars and there aren't any extended fight scenes. This is drama is simply drama, and it is interesting. \n\nThe film is a police procedural with a difference: The hero is an ex-cop named Jung-ho (Kim Yoon-suk), now a pimp, and he is not a nice man. He is angered because a client of his call-girl service has been, he believes, kidnapping his girls and selling them. When another girl disappears, a phone number raises an alarm. He then sets out to track down the client. Playing his counterpart is Ha Jung-wo,o as the serial killer--a much more traditional leading man in South Korean films. Ha is given a chance to extend his range with this performance. Despite Jee being quickly identified as the killer, there is not enough time (for anyone), nor is there any desire to make any sort of psychological attempt at defining the serial killer. The psychology behind the murders is only interesting to the police, so far as it will get them a conviction.  Jee is defined by his grisly actions, caring little about the consequences for himself or others, living purely by the mom\n\nThe film's structure is relentless in maintaining suspense with a great sense of humor. Both the pimp and the killer are arrested. A ludicrous attack on the mayor of Seoul becomes a media sensation, and puts pressure on the cops to charge someone with something to change the headlines. The killer, a calm psychopath, claims nine murders--then 12, but changes his story and says he has no idea what he did with the bodies. He's released on lack of evidence.\n\nThe greatest strength of \"The Chaser\" is the fact that, despite what might sound like a familiar premise, it never plays out as expected--with Na weaving a complex and expertly crafted web of twists and turns. The film is tense right from the first scene, immediately catching the viewer off guard--it proceeds in a manner guaranteed to keep the viewer glued to their seat for the entire two hour running time. Self-serving motivations soon trump concerns for justice, but the pessimism of Na's slick debut never breaks false. Na consistently defies convention, revealing the identity of the killer early on. He makes perfectly clear what the killer is capable of, and then further flouting form by bringing the two leads into direct confrontation shortly after. Really a joy to watch.",

In the same style, the Korean movie industry is belting out many amazing films.  This is a full on Asian invasion.  The Chaser is a good choice for your first ride on the Seoultrain.\n\nA former detective turned pimp, Joong-ho Eom (Yun-seok Kim) copes with two tricks on the lam.  After setting up another romantic encounter, he discovers the caller's id is the same number who was last with the two missing girls.  He begins a ravenous chase through the streets of Seoul to find the caller and his missing hoes.\n\nA bow of respect toward Hong-jin Na (Director and Co-writer).  His first feature film delivers one of the best crime thrillers I have seen to date.  He chose the mountainous back roads of Seoul as the location.  Combined with the cinematography, they sharpen the edge of the story.  He drives the story deeper with amazing performances from each actor.

The excellent cinematography and well-done action sequences only further engross the audience into a world of crime and death.

True, it may be impossible to prove if they actually created that particular brand or not, but we can't deny that they've perfected it. Tales of reprisal in the hands of a skilled Korean director always seem to mean much more than just an eye for an eye. We've come to expect that from them. The Chaser however, meets those expectations in an unexpected way.\n\nSure, it's noir-ish and stylized like so many other Korean films, but what sets this apart is it's plethora of payoffs. In fact, it's not just the payoffs, it's the where and when and to whom that they happen. Sure, some movie aficionados say that payoffs are a cheap cop out, that they are nothing more than a convenient plot device designed to evoke our  basest emotions. Many times that's true. It's especially true when it's a subpar script that has difficulty standing on it's own or when it's formulaic tripe. That's not the case with this film, however. No, this movie uses payoffs as a reward for our own bloodlust.\n\nAdmit it, we like to see the bad guy get punished. In fact, the more vile the villain, the more satisfying the punishment. Anger is often the most honest emotion a film can conjure and what's wrong with that? Oldboy, Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance, A Bittersweet Life, Lady Vengeance, The Man From Nowhere, I Saw The Devil, all spectacular examples of Korean revenge cinema feeding our vicious nature. The Chaser doesn't disappoint it's proud lineage. In fact it raises the bar in many respects.\n\nHardass Jung-Ho is a former cop turned pimp. When some of his girls come up missing, his concern doesn't lie with their well being, it's lies with the prospect of losing an investment. The dangerous nature of their chosen career causes him no concern, it's the thought of them skipping town that has him in a tizzy. As the saying goes, \"Pimpin' ain't easy.\"\n\nIt's not until Jung-Ho notices a recurring phone number on his cell phone that he realizes there's something going on here. When the usually reliable Kim Mi-Jin is a no show after turning a trick, he finally decides to investigate. What he ends up uncovering is a truly creepy serial killer, an incompetent police force, and the adorable daughter of Kim Mi-Jin. Needless to say, two of the three of those discoveries get what's coming to them.\n\nThe aforementioned payoffs come in rapid succession once we meet our villain. After the gauntlet has been thrown down and everyone has been beaten senseless, the film begins to unravel our mystery in earnest. Naturally, this mission is replete with more savage beatings and more payoffs. In an odd turn of events, the biggest and most expected payoff of all never happens. It's ironic how in this instance the lack of pain and punishment is a bad thing. Sometimes denial is good for the soul.\n\nFor a first time filmmaker, Na Hong-Jin knocks it out of the park. Abounding with the usual superlative Korean camerawork, the film has a noticeable ebb and flow. The efficient and graceful shots draw you in when needed and occasionally leave you out for your own good. Films like this are dependent on boundaries and Hong-Jin keeps that delicate balance throughout.\n\nFor some reason, people say that revenge is a dish best served cold. Where's the fun in that? Sure, it's good to be somewhat calculating and nefarious in our revenge planning, but I prefer my revenge with a little more sizzle. Making revenge chilly just seems so... boring. Make mine hot to the touch with a little pink in the middle and serve it up with a big bowl of ass kicking brutality. This film serves it up perfectly... Revenge!",

            "content": "¨I killed them.¨\n\nAfter reading several blogs about the best Korean films I decided to watch Hong-jin Na`s film, The Chaser. Korea is making some great films in this decade, but I wouldn`t consider The Chaser to be among their best. I had some issues with this movie, although it still left me with some great impressions. My favorite thriller of all time is Seven, and this film had a feeling similar to it, especially with the dark setting. It is a different kind of thriller because in the first 20 minutes the protagonist has already managed to catch the serial killer. The thrills come once the serial killer is interrogated by the police officers who show their complete ineptness to solve the case even when the killer has admitted his crimes. The problem is that the police officers aren`t able to find the bodies and have no evidence other than his testimony to accuse him in trial. They have only 12 hours to discover the whereabouts of the bodies before they have to set him free. Why isn`t his testimony enough? Because the killer is acting like a lunatic who doesn't know what he`s saying. The thriller almost turns into a comedy after watching the complete ineptness of the police officials. That is where the film lost me a little bit, because it goes a little too far with this issue that Hong-jin Na is trying to point out: Korean officials are completely inept and incapable of solving a crime that has been placed right before their eyes. The crime seems like a simple one to solve, there are leads they can follow all over the place, but they keep on screwing up and get nowhere. I did however like the twist near the end of the film that you would probably never see in a Hollywood film because it`s just way too dark.\n\nJoong-ho (Yun-seok Kim) is a pimp who is worried about his business because some of his work girls have disappeared. He believes that they`ve left him, but what he doesn't know is that there is a serial killer who has been killing them off one by one. After realizing that his last girl left the cell phone in his car, he begins to believe that someone is kidnapping his girls and selling them abroad. He goes back and retraces the number of the person who solicited the girls when they last disappeared and realizes they all come from the same number. When the serial killer, Young-min (Jung-woo Ha), calls again he sends another girl and orders her to give him the man`s address once she arrives at his place. Why? Because the killer always asks the girls to pick him up at a random location and then has them drive him to his place. The problem is that when Mi-jin Kim (Yeong-hie Seo) arrives at Young-min`s house there is no signal and she can't send the message. The pimp doesn't know the exact address of the house, but he knows the whereabouts because that is where the last girl had left his car and he finds Mi-jin`s vehicle there too. Young-min kills his victims by hammering some sort of stake to their head and barely hits Mi-jin with it before he is interrupted by a couple who are searching for the owner of the house. This is where we realize that Young-min has been operating from someone else`s home and has to kill the visitors as well. Before burying the victims, Young-min decides to get rid of their vehicle and that is when he crashes into Joong-ho`s vehicle and he discovers that he`s the man he`s looking for. Joong-ho beats him up and the police officers intervene and that is where the search for the bodies begins.\n\nSome of the problems I had with the plot beside the fact that the ineptness of the police officers was greatly exaggerated (but I guess that the director succeeded in trying to point this out) was that there were too many bad decisions made by Joong-ho and too many coincidences. First of all he lets the girl go to this man`s place without following them, then he accidently crashes into his vehicle (a great coincidence here), then he goes around driving everywhere in the car that should`ve been in the police`s hands after the accident. That car should`ve been their most important lead, trying to figure out who it belonged to and what Young-min was doing with it. The only person who investigates this is Joong-ho and he isn't thorough enough. Then near the end of the film there are several plot holes as well but I don't want to spoil anything for the viewers. Everything I`ve discussed before happens in the first twenty minutes of the film. There are just too many coincidences that take place and they felt really forced at times. The thriller does work however as a dark and violent one, and it leaves you haunted by some of the things that happen. Some of the images stay with you long after the credits begin to roll. I did enjoy this thriller, I just don`t think it is amongst the best Korean films considering there are so many great ones. \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com",

The writing is crafty and original which separates it from other Korean thrillers; who often add whimsical characters to lighten the mood.  The Chaser avoids these cliches, and gets solid performances from the entire cast. \nDirector, Hong-jin Na, wastes no time in creating the plot, but spends ample time developing the characters, allowing the audience to be subjected to a loose definition of morality. In the seedy world of prostitution, we are introduced to Joong-ho, a former police detective turned pimp. Due to financial woes Joong-ho begins searching for his \"girls\" as he assumes they ran off before paying.  Fate would introduce him to Young-min, the antagonist of the film, and self proclaimed serial killer. On any given day we would dislike both men, but the Chaser forces us to only hate on of them. It succeeds on all levels! We never really like either character, as they both share similar flaws, but the story shows there can be a fine line between good and evil.  And while this remains to be a true tale of revenge, our thirst for it is lost in this clever story appropriately named The Chaser.",

There is a great tension between Jung-Ho, the former cop, and his buddies who are still on the police force, as well as the complex relationship Jung-Ho has with his \"girls\" and his assistant/side-kick.  I underestimated his side-kick initially as a goofy almost comedic relief character, but there is even more depth to his role in the movie.  This was a very noirish film.

The story continued with him telling the cop that he killed all the girls, and still looked innocent.\nThis is a very in depth movie where it portrayed not only the horrible, distorted part of an impotent man revenging by killing girls that cant beat him, it also reveals the inefficiency of police department when investigating a case, and the how politicians might affect an investigation. It is a three-tier movie that wanted to tell more about the society, the politics, and the distorted psychology and the weak will not be able to protect themselves in anyway.\nA heavy but very meaningful movie. Last but not least, the horror and bloody part is really scaring.",

The protagonist--and only useful investigator--is an ex-cop turned pimp whose motive for finding the missing (and murdered) girls is, at least at first, purely mercenary. Needless to say, he is not a very likable fellow. \nThe suspense is masterfully (and maddeningly) extended over the film's two hours, and while it comes to no grand, action-packed conclusion, the note of bleak pathos on which the film ends is entirely apposite to all that has come before.\nDo yourself a favor and watch this film",

            "content": "This film wouldn't exist if a South Korean pimp wasn't protective of his ho's.\r\n\r\nNow I'm not saying for a second that he cares for them in any special way that isn't directly related to either their lady-bits or the income generated by same - in fact he drags one off her sickbed demanding she get back to work (I guess his argument may have been \"Well you're already on your back, might as well be gettin' paid!\") - but if Jung-Ho didn't order a search for the missing Mi-Jin a dangerous serial killer might just have gone about his merry depraved way.\r\n\r\nYep The Chaser is a serial killer movie, but not in the standard sense. We meet the killer early and he never makes much attempt to hide his identity or true nature once it becomes clear he is in trouble. The film becomes more about whether the gruff and disagreeable pimp Jung-Ho will find his 'staff', if the afore-mentioned 'staff member' Mi-Jin will survive or if the bad guy Ji Young-Min will get away... or get his just desserts.\r\n\r\nIt is here that there is little doubt, Ji Young-Min deserves everything coming to him. He finds his targets in various brothels and parlours around the city, then casually has them drive him back to his residence. Once inside he cares little if they realise he isn't your standard client (the bloodied tufts of hair and scalp in the bathroom are a bit of a giveaway). The house is locked tight and soundproof enough that struggle is irrelevant and merely energy wastage. \r\n\r\n25ish Ji Young-Min has no special trick or trait that makes him especially original or memorable, nor does he standout due to his appearance, he is average height build and looks. But Ji Young-Min is a straight up nasty guy. His tools of the trade are quite literally tools, he tells the girls what will happen and gets to it. Later on he calmly explains the ins and outs to the police force in graphic detail, so calmly that they aren't positive he isn't just having them on.\r\n\r\nAfter a (little too) coincidental meeting that lands both the killer and pimp in the police station for questioning the fun really starts. Jung-Ho is an ex-cop who didn't exactly leave the force in a blaze of glory, so his ex colleagues are loathe to believe that Ji Young-Min is really the man responsible for three of his women going missing. Ji on the other hand initially and persistently claims that he was randomly assaulted for no reason, eventually though his web of lies and evidence start catching up with him, at which time he becomes far more truthful and co-operative, opening up about a series of unsolved murders from previous years.\r\n\r\nMany further complications arise when the several bodies that are alleged to exist aren't found. Is Ji really a mass murderer or merely a wannabe that claims to be one as Jung-Ho believes? The political side of the police force also raises its head when lawyer's ponder if the whole thing hasn't been trumped up to distract the media from a recent - and very public - embarrassment to the force.\r\n\r\nTo top all this off Mi-Jin's young daughter gets involved, and despite his better judgment Jung-Ho finds himself ferrying her around as he continues his search. (Whether the rest of his ho's got the day off is never mentioned, they must be a trustworthy bunch.) This isn't a case of the gruff guy learning to love and care, Jung-Ho is not the sensitive parenting type and doesn't convert along the way.\r\n\r\nPhew. It really is that complicated but it is all held together pretty well by strong performances and some effective chase sequences.\r\n\r\nI found the 2 major coincidences that occur near the end and the start just a little too much to bear - even though this is purported to be based on a true story, whatever that means these days - and the continued inability of the police force to make logical decisions was frustrating to me as a viewer, it would obviously be even worse if this was the 'true' part!\r\n\r\nThe action holds it all together though, some foot chases through the streets and alleys of the city are especially exciting and will leave you breathless, and that's before the finale; a blood-soaked no holds barred doozy of a contest between two men with absolutely everything to lose.\r\n\r\nAlso don't expect a Hollywood style happy ending, as in real life the good guy doesn't always win, the innocents aren't always saved and the bad guy sometimes gets his way. This is South Korean after all, the land of Sympathy for Mr Vengeance and The Host.\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 7.5 / 10. An amazing looking, well acted serial killer film that is actually more a 2 hour adrenalin-fueled chase flick through the back alleys of a South Korean city.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 700 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

About every Korean movie that I've seen, I've dug the gritty, realistic, and riveting nature of the stories but always desired for more thematic or moralistic content and \"The Chaser\" is no different. The director takes us for a ride and he knows he is. What I especially admired about this movie was how there weren't any special mechanics, unique camera angles, or \"indie-like scenes\" that puzzle the mind; he lets the engrossing story do its work -- a classically made movie. The director's confident with the content that he has (Performances all around was superb, screenplay was engaging, and pacing was near-perfect). Extremely tense and frantic thriller that is sure to entertain; even the comic relief worked. On the contrary, there isn't much to it afterwards. \"The Chaser\" falls short from being a masterpiece... but that's many of the Korean movies that have been coming out nowadays. \"The Chaser\" is highly recommended. Adjusted the rating from 3 1/2 to 4 stars.",

            "content": "Many movies in the thriller genre have been given many new structures and plots.  Prime examples are with Alfred Hitchcock and his many famous films like Psycho, Vertigo, and Rope, others from different directors are The Fugitive, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Ichi the Killer, I Saw the Devil, and Park's classic Vengeance Trilogy.  Each gave innovation and superb execution in their respective genre.     \n\n     Some rely on the mysterious whodunit plot.  Some on action oriented execution.  Some on utilizing plot and imagery to benefit character development and logical study.  Others on more of an adventure execution that's more straightforward, but mainly has the viewers wondering how everything will turn out in the end.  The Chaser fits in the later category.\n\n     In downtown Seoul, an ex-detective turned streetwise pimp Joong-ho makes his living on the other side of morality by renting his prostitutes to various clients.  He begins to notice that his business is slowly going under when he realizes that some of his women have gone to a certain address and have turned up missing.  Upon discovering that one of his employees, Mi-jin- a struggling single mother with a seven year old daughter- has been called to the same address at Mangwon District, he has her give him information on the client and his whereabouts.  While inside the residence, Mi-jin later falls victim to the client Young-min's murderous nature and discovers that he's been killing prostitutes.  Joong-ho captures Young-min only to be apprehended by the local police.  Young-min confesses to the killings.  Knowing the system, Joong-ho is given 12 hours to search for incriminating evidence before Young-min is set free.\n\n     Being inspired by the true event of the killings of the notorious Yoo Young-chul, the plot seems straightforward.  As the story progresses we begin to learn more about Young-min with every piece of evidence and confession that is being obtained.  It begins as if it's a mystery, but is later given a new twist.  Instead of learning about the killer and later him being revealed, he's revealed and we begin to learn about him then.  Despite this change in the style, the plot is very engaging and thrilling.  The reason beside everything that happens becomes explained as the story progresses.  Every dynamic is handled well and nothing drones out.\n\n    While not the most innovative in its genre, The Chaser is a great example that many filmmakers can draw influence in how to make an effective thriller.  The Vengeance Trilogy is looked at by most viewers as the ultimate movie trilogy that represents the K-thriller genre as we know it.  The Chaser takes a more different approach in how these presented plot dynamics where presented in Park's films and tells them through more of an action/adventure perspective.  One can think of it as like The Fugitive except without the whodunit plot point.  Despite this change in dynamic its execution is greatly handled.\n\n     Joong-ho is played by Yun-seok Kim (Tazza: The High Rollers).  Jung-woo Ha (Time) plays Young-min.  Mi-jin is played by Yeong-hie Seo (Shadows in the Palace, Bedeviled).  Every actor does great.  Each character brings a sense of atmosphere and thrills to the story.  Every character provides multiple levels of intrigue and every one of them play their parts in progressing the story.\n\n     Being the directorial debut of Hong-jin Na, everything in The Chaser is handled expertly.  The pacing, plot structure, and music are wonderfully handled and never drone out.  The cinematography is great.  The backgrounds look very massive and lifelike.  Every image is wonderfully shot and every technical aspect does great at contributing to the movie.\n\n     The Chaser is a very well crafted and expertly made thriller that any fan of K-movies cannot afford to miss.  Hong-jin Na would later go on to make another directorial hit piece, The Yellow Sea.  After seeing and enjoying this movie, I'd love to see the latter film.\n\n*Thanks for reading and Happy Halloween.",

For me it was more a resemblance of modern BBC TV Detective dramas. The Chaser (a 2010 remake) is slick, deep and packing intelligence, emotion and multi-level story into what is an ex cop enters a serial killers world.\n\nIt is shot well, with great South Korean filmography in feel and character. It is deep, engaging, entertaining and well cultured. \n\nThe plot involves an ex policeman turned prostitute guardian (pimp). One of his girls goes missing, captured by a twisted customer, who has scared girls before, who turns out to be a serial killer. As the police detain the killer there is a race to find the imprisoned last victim, as she is till alive in an unknown house. More of the killer's character is unravelled, whilst ex-cop Jung-ho has to look after the victim's young daughter, helping to save her mother before it is too late. All of this is shot well in a gritty, but greatly real, Mangwan in Seol at night amongst the streets, back allies and shady homes near the mountains.\n\nIf you are into World Cinema and these style of cat and mouse detective dramas, then this film will please fans. I do feel sorry that it suffers from top-billing and raving reviews as a cult gem, when it was for me slick and well produced, rather than being anything special, unique or extra-ordinary. The film is slow, long (2 hours) and thus an asking watch, but a debatably worthwhile one none the less.",

And the actors played their parts perfectly, especially the main character, who reminded me quite a bit of the main character from Oldboy (I actually thought it was the same guy at first).  Although it doesn't quite match up with Oldboy in my opinion, its still an outstanding movie.  The extreme violence and gore is shocking but necessary, and there were several scenes where I was literally holding my breath because I didn't know what was going to happen next.

He's livid, he's mad as all hell and he aims to drag them back by the hair because he thinks they ran away. After some digging around though he comes to the conclusion that a customer has actually been selling these women; he's even more furious now because this person is messing with his merchandise and he won't stand for it. One of his few remaining girls recently landed a new job, a job he notes to be very similar to the ones the missing girls also had. He sets a plan in motion for the girl to follow up on the job, while demanding that she keep him updated as to her location so that he can come and deal with the guy himself. Now, as you watch the movie you just have to think sarcastically: \"Yeah, that will end well\" Alas, you would be right. Things go to hell and soon Mr. Pimp becomes less consumed with getting back his merchandise and more concerned about the welfare of \"his employee.\" the human being. With every step he makes towards finding her, you see him for who he really is -- an obnoxious, street-smart, potty mouthed, softie. Mr Pimp isn't on his own in this journey, the South Korean cops are as well - a group that provides us viewers with much humor as they couldn't pin a murder on Freddy Krueger even if they gave it their all.. Now, throw in a cute little girl, a murderer who is either really cunning or so stupid that he seems cunning, a whole lot of blood splatter, hammers hitting heads, and you've got The Chaser - a surprisingly decent and entertaining flick. \n\nI had my doubts at first since I thought it was going to be another pointless gore fest (after only watching the first 10 minutes), so I kept pausing it and putting it on hold...reluctant as I was to watch women get chopped up repeatedly. Thankfully though, its really not like that and on the flip side, those who just love gory bits would probably be disappointed. I haven't seen Kim Yoon Seok's previous work before, so I can't compare his performance or anything, but I do know that his performance as the pimp was quite good and I'd like to see more of him. I've seen Ha Jeong woo (the killer) before (Yellow Sea) and found him intriguing, but the Chaser proves that he is also quite versatile.  So, the cast is good, the characters are interesting. I eventually became glued to it all and didn't wish to press pause even once. I recommend it.",

The story, while not fantastic, is intense.  And the fight scenes are really good, they feel real, mostly because they're really rough with each other, so it adds to the realism of the scene.

It feels like your heart it left pounding continually for it 2 hour length, such is the frantic pace in which you follow a former corrupt cop turned pimp as he searches desperately for one of his girls, learning along the way that there is more to his profession than just money.

            "content": "Decidedly Eastern in sensibilities, The Chaser is a very fine thriller which erupts into a sort of criticism of \"the system\", portraying the police as largely inefficient. With fine performances and crisp, focused direction, The Chaser doesn't waste any time getting to the point, and, it puts a spin on the genre when the killer is in fact in custody 30 minutes into the film. At this point, the film shows its true colors as a vicious critique of having to work through the system, culminating in a conclusion which has the capacity to provoke discussion depending upon your view of vigilante justice. By the end of the film, a viewer's opinion of whether Joong-ho, the pimp trying to prove a killer has killed his prostitutes, has succeeded at accomplishing anything will likely  vary from someone else's. If you're expecting the hero to overcome the inefficiency of the system, then you shouldn't feel so comfortable. \r\n\t\r\nThe basic story is simple. At the beginning of the film, ex-cop turned pimp Joong-ho (played by  Yoon-seok Kim) discovers that two of his prostitutes went missing when they went to a location that he just sent another of his girls to. With this knowledge, he goes to the location believing that the man (named Yeong-min and played by Jeong-woo Ha) there is re-selling his prostitutes, and is able to chase down and capture the man after he refuses to give him his cell phone number. However, both men are arrested at the site of a traffic collision they started. At the police station, Joong-ho tries to convince the police that the man he has captured has either resold or killed his girls, but the police are unsure about the validity of his claims. \r\n\t\r\nThe Chaser is deft in its ability to accomplish a feeling of uneasiness while peppering itself with genre thrills. There are well-orchestrated and exciting foot chases to be found, but the movie largely adopts a slow burn to slowly increase the tension throughout, punctuated by more than one brutal, gruesome killing. At times the film also serves as an interesting showpiece for how to effectively mix art-house sensibilities and good old-fashioned blood and guts, but the movie is never heavy-handed or overly obvious. It moves with a quiet efficiency and provides all the tension one would expect from a solid thriller, and it takes the viewer along a trip which is simultaneously familiar and different, but, ultimately, it is the undercurrent of this movie, the pointedness of its critique, which elevates the film from very good thriller to superb drama. \r\n\t\r\nThe Chaser's criticism of \"the system\" is based in a story that is personal and immediate, rather than on philosophical ramblings. Everything plays out as a conflict between Joong-ho, Yeong-min, and the police, and by keeping the story small and personal, its effectiveness is enhanced. Because of this, the already effective genre offering of The Chaser becomes all the more compelling, as it makes the lead character more sympathetic and his conflict more relatable. We feel for him as he tries to prove what he knows but no one else will believe, and it makes the viewer feel as desperate as he does. The suspense is enhanced because of this, creating a thriller that is more thrilling than it would otherwise be if its lead was more one-dimensional. The Chaser is a well above-par thriller, the kind that is chilling, thrilling, smart, and emotionally involving. \r\n\r\nRating: 8.0/10",

            "content": "Chugyeogja Excellent movie I cannot remember how I found out about it . Joong-ho is a dirty detective turned pimp in financial trouble as several of his girls have recently disappeared without clearing their debts. While trying to track them down, he finds a clue that the vanished girls were all called up by a same client whom one of his girls is meeting with right now. The plot stems around an amoral ex-cop turned pimp who after losing some of his \"working girls\" decides to track down & find the client behind this. He ends up finding himself involved in more than he bargained for, with the client being a serial killer, & its then a chase to find his last girl sent to him whilst the police also try to pin him down but are hampered by legal red tape & politics. Excellent thriller IFC made excellent choice with this one except I canâ(TM)t believe it did not make really big hit when it played here in USA. Must not have been that big of a release. A little gory but overall really believable. Film is based on a real serial killer episode in Korea. I guess the actual killing were even more gruesome than presented here. Old Boy & Memories of Murder were my all time fave Korean films but no longer this one is TOPS. The film is really Korean thru & thru & does not have much of a linear structure. The way it is filmed & cut & the way the story is presented doesn't conform to the way many Americans think genre clues should be presented but that is what makes this a really truly great film!  It is in many ways a shocking film & even film goers in korea were shocked. Parts of the film were problematic for me by allowing silly coincidences & the having characters making dumb decisions  (creating or ignoring certain facts & logic of mind) however here I just suspend my belief & let the complete enjoyment of the film come thru. Highly recommended donâ(TM)t miss it.  There are a lot of negative reviews about this film & I obviously donâ(TM)t agree. Read Roger Eberts review of this film.",

As Joon-ho searches along with the little girl for her mother, the lethargic police are having trouble gettting enough evidence to charge the killer despite his confession and a house full of bodies they seem too incompetent to find. A bulk of the film is our heroic pimp retracing the killer's steps to try to find his last hide out and therefor the little girls mother, while cutting back and forth to baffled police trying to make their case stick while the confessed killer refuses to tell them where she and the other bodies are. (and despite the possiblity that there is one victim who may still be alive, the police decide to wait till morning to begin searching. Nice!... Not to mention that the pimp sent this girl to the killers house to begin with and never recorded the address one of his girls was going to? )Not sure what all the good word is about, as the flick was rather tedious, boring and relied too much on the stupidity of certain characters to try to create suspense.",

            "content": "The Chaser is an intensely mesmerizing and keeping on the-edge of your seat experience. But more than that I should say it's a devastating experience...that I truly felt at close to the end of the film. The film is based on a real life serial killer in South Korea, who was convicted in 2005 for murdering 20 people. The film starts with a dirty detective turned pimp (Jung-ho) who is in financial trouble as several of his girls have recently disappeared without clearing their debts. While trying to track them down, he finds a clue that the vanished girls were all called up by a same client whom one of his girls is meeting with right now. He begins to look for her in that client's mentioned location of area & during the search, Jung-ho even able to catch that man (wearing blood splattered shirt) in an alley. But just after that the police takes control over the situation. The police suspects & Jung-ho believes this man is the killer or abductor but there's no significant evidence in their hand other than his utterly misleading confession. And from that point of the film The Chaser becomes more intriguing the more you watch with all the twists & turns till the final credit rolls.\nIt's not just another crime drama about a serial killer and some guys chasing him; there's comedy of errors in the way the police and politicians are portrayed, there's a nice dose of emotional content that grows around the little girl of a prostitute who doubts something bad happened to her mother, there's sufficient psychological thriller element that comes through the way the killer messes with the minds of the police and last but not the least there's the shattering finale...as in the way everything ends.",

Fair warning: it's about a serial killer and is graphically violent.  I didn't like that aspect of it, but I have to give the movie four stars for telling a complex story the old fashioned way, with excellent acting and cinematography.  The foot chases through the alleyways of Seoul rival the car chases in Bullitt and The French Connection, and the gripping story is delivered realistically, without tricks or flash-forwards and flash-backs.  The director, Hong-jin Na, must be one cynical bastard, or at the very least not terribly fond of Seoul's policemen and detectives.  The incompetence of officialdom will make you laugh one moment and shout at the screen in frustration the next. This is one hardcore crime movie, one you'll remember for a long time.  They say the Koreans are making kickass movies.  If this one's any indication, count me in.",

            "content": "Just finished watching The Chaser on Netflix, which is a Korean Serial Killer Thriller... and a blueprint for how Hollywood needs to make a thriller.  I can only imagine there will be an Americanized remake sooner or later.  It's a very dark tale of Joong-ho, an ex-cop-turned-pimp whose girls have started to go missing.  He sends out another girl of his, Mi-Jin, and she is captured by a sadistic, hammer-wielding seriel killer.  Joong-ho happens upon the killer by accident, but both he and the killer are arrested by the bumbling police force. In the process the killer admits to killing many women. Since they had no arrest warrant and little evidence except for the killers confessions of murder, they have twelve hours by Korean law to get the evidence for an arrest warrant or he goes free. Joong-ho then spends the next twelve hours trying to use his detective skills to follow the various clues and find the location of the bodies in the hopes of finding Mi-Jin alive.  Will Joong find Mi-Jin alive? Can he stop a killer from being set free to kill again?  Can Joong-ho rediscover the compassion and humanity that he seemed to lose years ago as a cop? Great movie!",

Kim Yooung-seok's mesmersing performance as the pimp whose buried humanity surfaces when confronted with the missing prostitute's daughter is an amazing and physical tour de force (none more so than during his desperate hunt for the killer in the final reel) and almost reduced me to tears when he takes the little girl's hand in the hospital room.  A superb and suspense-filled thriller that will have you gnawing at your knuckles. Gob-smackingly awesome and totally recommended.",

Originally released in 2008 in it's homeland of South Korea, this spectacular thrill ride didn't reach our shores until late this year through the Melbourne International Film Festival (& now DVD). I don't know why it took so long...don't really care either because it's here now & I'm thankful it even reached here lol Na Hong-Jin's assured debut tells the intense story of a disgraced cop turned pimp (!) who believes 2 of his girls (or hoes for that matter) have ran away so he goes after them, which leads to some shockingly unforeseeable twists that soon make him realise that all is not what it seems. To go into anymore detail would mean ruining the brilliance of the films jaw-dropping plot so I will leave it at that. But all you need to know is its a great thrill ride with twists & shocks around every corner. Not to mention it has one of the year's best international acting performances by hugely talented newcomer Kim Yun-Seok in the lead role, this is an absolute MUST SEE!",

To be honest in the halfway mark I started to lose some interest in it because it was moving pretty slow developing the clues and characters but once it gets going again it goes full speed and never stops and I was blown away with the end result and like I said its like a roller coaster because it goes up slowly with you anticipating the rush and fear then it goes full speed then cools off to go full speed again for its conclusion. I thought the acting was spot on and fantastic while the filming was expertly done when it came to atmosphere and grittiness, when it gets down and dirty its very graphic and brutal but then some scenes are left to the imagination which is more disturbing sometimes than actually seeing it take place. The finale was bittersweet to me but I like how it was so unpredictable with its twists and turns that it will take your breath away and thats how I overall was pleased because it definately got me back for the ride in the end. Overall its kind of like Seven meets The Departed and I can see this film being remade and has the ptential to be even better and a potential oscar contender just like how the remake of The Departed ended up being, this is gripping entertainment at its best and no it wasnt as good as reviews are claiming it to be and it wasnt perfect by my standards but compared to some american thrillers as of late this is rock solid!

We watched this tonight in one sitting gripped by vivid story and performances. Has me reflecting on South Korean film in general, the profound sadness and emotional honesty that comes through in many of their films. They take story to the utmost, and this doesn't mean graphically violent, rather emotionally potent, bringing us forward to see things of magnitude. Reminiscent of Shakespeare in effort to reach tragic proportions. In many ways this is familiar Detective Thriller territory, however many touches and the overall narrative structure set it quite apart from the familiar tropes of Hollywood structure. This is familiar, yet different, and in the differences are profound meanings. We loved the theme of the price of not listening, or not answering the phone or listening to an individual or friend: when a city or government doesn't listen to it's individual citizens, civic pain is the response, a sense of dehumanization. In many South Korean films humanity is the quality most at stake. Humanity and dignity. The crying out for a sense of unification is often present, and that is no exception in this film. There are some violent moments, and moments of extremely violent tension, yet it is never isolate, a mere function of the tenstion, rather always a function of the reality of the film, the story, in a way that brings each scene to have several meanings. Reminiscent of Hitchcock that way, although here it's Hitchcock meets Silence Of The Lambs or Se7en. Grisly, yet thoughtful, utterly nonstop tense. If you have a taste for grisly thrillers this is the one. Watch it before the translation to American idiom and enjoy the references to South Korean frustration with it's civic leaders and police force. The problems there are not the same as the ones in North America, and in many ways our depth of frustration is not as painful or poignant. At times quite funny, it is in the end a somber film. Many South Korean films I've seen have a downbeat feel to them. This is not a false thing, rather a reflection of the artistic need to express what experience is showing, and hopefully point out the new directions. That is one thing we find universally in all the films we've loved from South Korea, conscience towards elevation, ways to change and make things better. For anyone interested in powerful, darkly funny, and immensely entertaining, and sad, filmmaking, check out The Chaser, and while you're at it check out The Host, Old Boy, and the films of Kim Di Duk (Time, and Spring Summer Winter Fall and Spring Again, among others).

Someone has been killing prostitutes, and it's up to the pimp to save the neighborhood. Wish I had thought of that plotline.",
