The dialogue is cutting and immensely funny, the action is out of this world, and the emotional storyline is very moving. Kash plays Rocky brilliantly, and Sanjay Dutt is an amazing nemesis. The movie seems like a modern-day myth, or a lost city of El Dorado and its untold riches. Brilliant and definitely worth sitting through the epic 5-hour story.",

This is a movie that has a lot of action and fast-paced moments and it makes it a fun time. The story is somewhat inconsistent in its execution but for the most part, I was engaged with it. With the recent success of the second movie, I wanted to go ahead and check out the first part and I think I definitely liked it enough to continue watching the series. Overall, it is a movie most concerned with being entertaining and on that front, I think it is a good time, despite some overdramatic moments as well as some chaotic storytelling.",

            "content": "I know, many people will mark this review unhelpful when Chapter 2 comes closer to release. But honestly those toxic fans are the reason why my hopes from this film were so high. When the trailer for KGF: Chapter 2 came, many people were saying that this film will mark the end of Bollywood. I saw KGF: Chapter 1 hoping that this film will be something like Baahubali (without the CGI of course). But no, this isn't any different from any normal South Indian film. In fact, it is pretty much what everyone hates about Bollywood. It has eve teasing, corrupt politicians, peaceful religion shown as good people and Hindus shown as bad people, unrealistic action and item songs.\n\nThe film begins by mentioning Rocky (of course, the most unique name for a hero) is the most wanted criminal in Indian history, and yet there is nowhere that his account has been mentioned. Now I have several questions. How come one book is the only source of the people knowing about the biggest criminal to ever exist? How come no one else wrote about it? I'm 99% sure there must have been some Ravish Kumars or Arnab Goswamis at the time who would write this down at least in secret. And what about the TV channels who must have accidentally aired it before it was announced that it has to be a secret? And what about international news sources? If they can write about Dawood Ibrahim, why not about this? But anyway, let's not get carried away by just one illogical thing. There are a dozen more to come.\n\nNow, Rocky had been told in his childhood by his dying mother that he has to become the richest and the most powerful person in the world, and that's what he sets out to do. Except there is one problem - he doesn't even know what the most powerful position is. He goes in the side of the underworld and tries his best to establish himself over there, while the UN secretary-general probably laughs in the corner. Also keep in mind that the UN secretary-general is only the most powerful person in the world, not the richest. So now he has to get to a position without looking suspiciously rich. But don't worry about that, because Rocky is too busy singing Happy Birthday while killing bad guys.\n\nSpeaking of killing bad guys, everytime Rocky fights, there are always like, a dozen jump cuts and lights flickering. He can kill his enemies and his audience who suffer from epileptic seizures. And speaking of epileptic seizures, let's play the drinking game. Every time the screen blacks out, you take one sip. By the end of the film you won't have enough space in your body to insert more liquid. Good luck in the toilet. And speaking of drinking, of course no South Indian film can be completed without harassing or verbally abusing a woman till she gives in. So there is the villain's daughter who is drinking in the public after blocking the road (it looked like a cheap parody of Watchmen). Now I don't know if the Hindi dubbing was so horrendous or the dialogues were actually so bad, but our hero starts speaking gibberish while beating her henchmen.\n\nBut once the second half starts the film gets much better. Rocky goes inside KGF, and that is where the big story starts. At that point I have no complaints. In fact, it is where the film shows why it is so popular. However, there also some of the cinematography problems do exist, like the bad camera angles, quick jump cuts and of course, the screen going black. But the selling point of the film is the colour grading. That has been done very well, to the point that some scenes look like perfect desktop wallpapers. The ending looked very iconic, something that one will remember while leaving the theatre.\n\nThe ideas used in this film are very good. From showing how Rocky goes ahead to touch the heroine while ensuring that the henchmen don't shoot him, to arranging the gun for the minister's murder - everything seemed unique, even if it was predictable at some points. The action is pretty much the same as any other South Indian film, and that is what makes it fun to watch. This is one thing that I find very annoying about Bollywood; it is trying to look as realistic as possible nowadays, because of which it feels like a washerman's dog. And I guess this is probably what all those people were talking about when they said this is better than most of Bollywood nowadays.\n\nI'd definitely look forward to Chapter 2 when it comes, because of how much suspense it built up in the end. It doesn't end with a question like why Katappa killed Baahubali, but rather one like what will happen next. Although it is pretty obvious what is going to happen next, let's be honest. None of us are in for the story. We just want to see some of that Yash.",

The writers efforts could easily be seen over the screen. The best art were analogies and poems used within. Archana Jois gave a splendid performance playing Rocky's mother, a strong feminist performace and very strong character as well as supporting role. Rocky played by Yash is potrayal of Sorrow, Anger, Heroism and Peace artform. Character is well written bit superbly potrayed. Srinidhi Shetty plays love interest of Rocky but fails to make an impactful performance. Mouni Roy in cameo appearence, adds glamour in her short screen time. Direction came as an icing to the cake where the storyline played at various timelines was so intense, that it developed a sense of enjoyment for 200 minutes of plessure.",

            "content": "Chapter 1 sets the stage for a Macro level showdown in Chapter 2.\n\nWhat's Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.\n\nKGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India's Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)\n\nThe film is narrated through the author's (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one's memory to remember the count of characters. Yash's introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.\n\nKGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's \"The Oil\"(Dunkirk).\n\nOn Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2.",
