I don't have a problem with the \"family member has died and now the horror symbolises how we have to get over said family member\" trope that you see so often in horror movies (The Babadook, Hereditary, Lights Out), but the unoriginality doesn't stop there.\n\nWho else called that while driving at night on the spooky road they would nearly hit someone? How many horror movies have you seen that in? It's not scary or original.\n\nWhat about \"it looks like it's going to be a jumpscare but it's just a person giving a friendly hello\"... That happens at least three times during the movie, and it just drags it out. Oh, and also forgot to mention this movie also has \"the black man dies first\", which is an awful trope that I wish we could retire already. It's sad that I can watch a horror movie and know a person is going to die first because of the colour of their skin.\n\nThen there's the numerous plot holes you have to suspend your disbelief for just to stop yourself from facepalming about. First I saw was: The killer was somehow getting into the house supposedly using the key they found under the mat but the real estate guy gave the spare key back to them. The second was: You don't need a SIM card to call the police, and no smart phone displays \"no SIM detected\" blocking access to the phone (after all, a phone has other uses besides calling people? It's a SMARTphone). Third was: How did the killer kill the Chris guy without them hearing anything? We know his throat wasn't slit while he was sleeping and that he put himself in the car because if his throat was slit while he was sleeping, there would have been blood all over the couch and leading to the car.\n\nNext, the director seems to have failed to include a resolution to the narrative. Like, at all. So the narrative builds up to the climax, then stops. Several times I wanted to quit watching the movie because I felt so tired watching it. The directors idea of tension is as limp as a wet noodle because about 60% through the movie I was WISHING someone would just die already. \n\nThe characters and symbolism lack the depth of something like The Babadook. The setting isn't anything unique, spooky large house in the woods has been done before. The story isn't unique of course, other than lacking a resolution at all, but that's like ripping a page out of a book and saying it's something completely new.\n\nI would give this movie one star if it didn't feel like it was MEANT to waste my time. After forcing me to slog through something riddled with plot holes, poor pacing and a laughable antagonist, it doesn't even have the mercy to have a proper resolution.",

Netflix movies always go for a pure open end, always leaving something to be desired.\n\nMurder for the sake of it, Scream Logic, is absolutely fine in my book. I even liked the creepy premise of someone fucking with the family. But there is just a point in the movie where you gotta draw the line and say \"NO STOP IT\". And that is when the murderer shows up and you dont even show who it is. Is it just a random dickhead? Is it someone in the community?

Such as holes? Loose ends? Who's the killer? Why did he do this? Why was the woman looney? Yeah, just make up your own theories, because NONE of that actually gets answered.\n\nThe killer may not have needed a reason to kill, because some just do, but the least we could've gotten is some sort of motivation or a look at his psych or even some sort of better approach. Nope, he just does what he does because these characters were unlucky, and stupid enough to let this happen (as were the cops in the film too, since they also didn't do their job here, but that's more grounded to reality, since some cops truly don't do anything and allow tragedies to happen). The Strangers managed to make this intention work better in the movie, because it PROPERLY set ups to be a home invasion thriller and suspense film.\n\nIt all feels more coldhearted to kill off these characters that, in a way, didn't actually deserve to die (yes, they were jack asses, but if they really wanted to kill them off, they couldn't have given us less of these characters and just gotten to the killings instead of random pranks everywhere in the house), and that doesn't work well in a film where apparently there central characters were meant to be liked. Had the intention been that this killer was just an outlet for the director to have his own Freddy, it would've made sense, and the idea that a psycho goes on a killing spree in open houses is...unique in a way, because lord knows how scary it is that someone may have gotten into your own home, but the overall execution is just a joke. It's not the most realistic set up either, as it wouldn't be hard to figure out someone is in your house, and that basement scene where they're supposed to be lighting up the heater should very much indicate someone's down there, as it's too narrow for anyone to actually hide (the killer is also a damn giant).\n\nBy the end, we see the obvious killer heading to another Open House, to start his prey targeting all over again. Whether or not that was hinting at a possible sequel, it's up to you, but let's hope it doesn't happen again.",

I watched to the end of the credits just in case there's a mention of some actual plot at the end. There must exist somewhere, a scene of the film that was cut out of the final master accidentally. That's the only explanation I can think of. Still doesn't change the fact that this Peter Parker lookin ass forgot how to run despite being a fucking athlete. Doesn't change the fact that BBTC took out the SIM card instead of just taking the phone (you can still call 911 without a SIM) and doesn't change the fact that 90% of this trash is littered with nauseating suspenseful music which ruins any chance of actually being even remotely startled by its constant jump-scares. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!! This is not entertainment, it's a test of one's resolve and I gotta say after sitting through this burst anus of a film till the very end I don't wanna hear people talking about how tough it is being in the Marines.

Trouble is, you don't realize how poorly crafted this movie is until it fails to explain ANYTHING at the end. Shame on this director for providing us with a rage-quit enduring ending and a writer who failed to deliver any meaning whatsoever. Worst movie I've seen in a long time. ",

I understand most main characters won't die in the majority of horror films and eventually get away- hoorah, but I also see in horror movies where the phone rings after the unexplained events happen, the characters go outside, in the dark, knowing there is a killer taunting them. This movie DID keep me on my toes because of the unexplained actions but to close the book on the killer's face would have been better than the ending they provided.

            "content": "I haven't read yet this as a potential theory (though I'm sure it's out there), but here goes...\n\nMy thought:is that the killer is neighbor's (Martha) husband, and they're actually working together. She's acting as if she has Alzheimer'st to cause confusion & add to the oddities/terror of the soon-to-be victims. When Logan escapes the house and runs to the woods and hides behind the log, Martha wanders extremely close to him, stares into the sky, then wanders away. I believe she actually saw him, got close enough to (again) add to his terror, walked away w/o interacting...and went straight to her husband to tell him where she saw him so that he could hunt him down to finish it. Add to that, it is possible her husband (and killer) is the plumber...which would additionally tie together some of his comments (being familiar/having been there) and finding Logan's phone, etc.\n\nOr....the actual killer is someone not introduced to the audience and everyone else in the movie is truly 100% innocent. We see stories daily in today's world/news of people being attacked or murdered, but we never actually find out all the details for closure on the vast majority of them. This movie captures that aspect amazingly in either of the above approaches. Look at this movie as if you were reading a news story, or the police involved...you have very little to go off, but at least have a couple additional possible clues that we normally wouldn't in real life.\n\nKudos to this movie breaking the norm that 99.99% of movies follow to give the audience full closure. This isn't the first, and hopefully is not the last, movie where the ending either isn't fully explained or isn't fully a traditional wrapped up happy ending. We don't always get all the answers, we don't always get our way, life isn't always fair. \n\nps: this is my very 1st movie review, after giving ratings reviews for countless of them. After reading many reviews, just felt strongly enough to put in my perspective and thinking this was a MUCH better movie than most reviews give it credit for. ",

Why does Martha keep saying things about how death follows you? Is she involved or completely a red herring? She says their house used to be hers and her husbands', is that connected to why it's occupants are being hunted?

The person that's supposedly been doing all of these things finally makes his move, but I really don't know why. I don't know who he is, or what he wanted with them. The only thing you get is a vague reference that he came into their home during an open house and never left.

I was expecting Martha or the guy who was in the house when the family came back after the first open house to have something to do with the eerie things going on in the house. Turns out, they really had nothing to do with the plot, other than to add a bit of suspense I suppose. I would love to know why there was a boarded up wall in the basement. I would love to know who the killer actually was and why he would be going to open houses in order to kill people. Most people don't live in their house by the time they have open houses, so it's confusing to me why he would target those houses. He just got \"lucky\" with this mother and son being there out of the mom's desperation. What was the point in the doors slowly opening and shutting? Why mess with the water heater? Why hide Logan's phone? So many questions that it would take too long to name. Unimportant, but I also absolutely hated that back slash above the stove that they wouldn't stop showing(because it was by the basement door). Overall, I did enjoy this movie because I like anything with some suspense and the acting was pretty good. The idea behind the movie definitely had potential, but it kind of fell flat in the end.",

Why did they go back into the house alone after the sister called to say there had been a break in, especially after all the other creepy things that had happened? Wouldn't any rational person call the cops before going in? Why was there some weird tunnel in the basement that was boarded up at the end?

A strong beginning worthy of any horror story setup quickly falls short as aimless and almost random moments clog the film's story. \n\nThe effects are minimum, with most the film forcing the viewer to latch on to creepy atmosphere, character play that feels detached, and shock gags that seem more at home on shows like 'Evil Things' or 'A Haunting'. With on exception.  The final act- my favorite part. It was bloody brutal and horrific in its cruelty. Still not enough to save \"The Open House\". \n\nOverall this is a sad \"should'a', could'a', would'a'\" experience through and through. The beginning should have catepolted \"The Open House\" into a nightmare setup. The mother-son in unknown environment,torment both by circumstance and evildoers, should have brought out scares and fears that took aim at the true plot, and the ending with the reveal and terrifying nature would have hit home and satisfied horror fans.

A killer, who we never see the face of, runs around and sadistically kills them all, then drives to the open house, I guess the motivation is to kill whoever next stays at the house? I don't know.

            "content": "At first, watching this flick progress, it came across to me as if this was what it would be if The Devil's Candy was a boring movie without the same intensity, excellent plotting, devil-worshiping and awesome heavy metal music.  Previous owner of a house wants to move in back into his old house by pushing the new family out, forcibly if he has to.  I mean I still feel that this really is a boring version of The Devil's Candy, but I think the movie has a more disturbing undercurrent going on than what you would normally think about when finishing this.  I've always felt that some of the best horror comes from stuff that people could believe might happen to them.  As much as I enjoy old 80s slashers, there's no way that people would believe that an unkillable monster will hunt them down and kill them.  Or aliens.  Or ghosts.  Or demons.  I could go on and on.  I'm not saying that a horror movie being something that could actually happen to me equals a quality movie, but it's always more probable and scarier to think that it could.  Having said all that, I find something that Logan said about open houses interesting and that is the fact that you're handing over your keys to a stranger to allow other strangers in your house and you don't know what those people do or, really, if they ever leave after the open house is done.  This isn't so much an issue where I live, where it's impossible to hide somewhere inside my house, there's no secret closets, basements or cellars to contend with.  If someone is inside the house, we're gonna know about it.  But that's not always the case in the U.S, where houses are just designed differently.  Like that idea that someone might be inside your house, as a result of one of these open houses, without you even know is enough to send chills up some people's spines.  Having said all of that, this basic concept isn't enough to save this movie from complete and utter boredom.  It's just not a particularly interesting movie past exploring the idea of intruders lurking in your house for, seemingly, weeks waiting for the perfect chance to strike.  Set-up is simple.  Logan and his mom are forced to move to his aunt's luxurious house after a personal tragedy forces them out of their house.  I think the major problem with this movie is that, and this might sound weird knowing that I value character development, is the fact that you spend most of your time with these unlikable characters and dealing with their own personal issues as they try to adjust to their new lot in life.  Naomi has to find a job to support her son, though she's struggling to do so.  She's stressed out, depressed, etc, etc, etc.  Logan, who saw his dad die, is forced out of school and taken to this new place without asking if he was ok.  His mother didn't even ask him how he was doing after everything that went down, never made sure to check if he was ok.  So that's what we have to deal with for a huge chunk of this movie and, while it isn't bad, it just isn't that interesting to begin with.  You don't really sympathize with either of them, cause Logan is kind of a dick to Chris, who's being friendly to his mom and, in general, just being a bit of a turd.  While Naomi comes across as unstable when she accuses Logan of playing pranks on her that are causing her to stress out and throwing a photo of them (with the dad) in the trash.  Like this was a bit of a stretch, honestly.  Cause there's an open house literally every Sunday.  Shouldn't it stand to reason that MAYBE one of the many people who come in the house on a Sunday did the shit that Naomi is accusing Logan of doing?  That's the most logical explanation to me.  Not to Naomi apparently.  So, yea, these characters are largely insufferable throughout the movie and the 'horror' doesn't really even kick until about halfway through.  I honestly would have preferred if this movie was a straight-up supernatural movie where the mother-son dynamic is explored through Logan and Naomi being forced to reconnect as a result of what they're going through.  I suppose you could say that that's what the movie tried to do anyway.  But, if that's what they were going for, then they really just failed miserably.  Again, Naomi and Logan are just insufferable so, in the long run, you don't end up caring one bit about what happens to them.  It does get better the closer you get to the climax, but by that point it's really too late.  There's some idiocy you have to deal with here, as well, not including Naomi's reactions to what's happening in the house.  There's a scene where someone, it seems, has broken into the house.  Set the table, lit some candles and set a phone on a platform.  When they arrive, the phone rings but nobody talks back.  Naomi and Logan call the cops who proceed to tell them, after they come over, that it was probably just bored kids playing pranks.  Because that makes perfect sense in the world we live in.  Some bored teens broke into a house, SET-UP THE TABLE FOR DINNER, LIT CANDLES and put a phone on a platform...to play a prank.  I'm sorry, but unless they're genius, teens are not that sophisticated to play a prank like that.  And, if teens in question are geniuses, then they're probably busy with important shit.  The sad thing is that SOME cops do shit like this, they brush off real concerns and then when an actual tragedy happens they're like 'we couldn't have done anything, it was unexpected'.  That's, sadly, been the fate of many abused women in the past and, realistically speaking, the cops are the real villains here.  They didn't do their job effectively and, surprise surprise, it ended in another tragedy.  The acting is fine.  Dylan Minnette is acceptable, but he literally always has the same expression on his face.  He has no depth at all and he plays the same types of characters.  Piercey Dalton, who plays Naomi, is good enough.  She's probably the best of everyone here, but it's not like that's really saying much.  The movie just sort of coasts by on its concept and the concept wasn't even that interesting to begin with.  There's a few jump scares, but there's nothing really all that memorable or that you haven't seen done better in The Conjuring, as an example, even though this isn't a supernatural movie.  I don't know what else to say.  The third act is decent, but it gets a little ugly at times, as in it just didn't fit with the rest of the movie, but it's about as \"good\" as this movie was ever gonna get.  I will say that I did like the ending not giving any fucks and ***SPOILERS*** killing everybody off.  Again, I think it plays into something that's real.  So that makes the ending a bit of a downer, but I didn't mind it at all.  This movie is watchable, at best, but that doesn't mean that it's any good.  There's no real reason you should watch this when a conceptually similar and vastly superior movie, in The Devil's Candy, is still available on Netflix.  Choose that instead.  The Devil's Candy eats movies like this for breakfast.",

I don't expect explanations for a supernatural horror film because it's the horror of the unknown. This is the horror of your paranoia coming to life and messing with you before moving on for the sequel killings. The lack of answers in this movie leaves me frustrated because, why them?

It's a huge shame that Netflix decided to brand this one a Netflix Original. After making some progress towards that label representing some stamp of acceptable quality, this film shows that Netflix has no actual standards when it comes to garnering the label.",

The Open House feels like it was written by 3 different writers who suddenly quit leaving one person left to connect all the dots. There's a lot of plot holes here and the movie ultimately ends on such a wtf kind of moment. The movie follows a young man named Logan (Dylan Minnette) who along with his mother Naomi (Piercey Dalton) moves into a relatives house after Logan's father is tragically killed. The house is located in a mountain region where life's a little different. The one catch to the house is that they have to leave every Sunday because it's an Open House for potential buyers to take a look at. Logan tells his mom about his uneasiness about this since strangers are lurking around the house the entire day (even though technically they don't even own this place). Soon enough the duo starts hearing bumps in the night and Logan starts to believe that someone may be stalking them. That's it. That's the plot. It's super simple and it's like the writers gave up by the end. There's maybe one creepy scene to this whole thing, but nothing ever pays off. We get the usual horror trope of a panning camera going through the house with ominous music, but it just cuts to the next day 99% of the time. Logan is kinda a dick too and he's never very likeable. There's so many subplots here that just never pay off. We get a shot of the basement where a tunnel is blocked....and never talk or see it again. We have a neighbor named Martha (Patricia Bethune) who changes her story every time, but guess what nothing to it. The even eventual plot turn and climax of the movie does't even pay off. You get an ending to it all where you're glad it's finally over. Overall, not scary, not a thriller, just stupid. Avoid this one.",

The framing of the plot almost seemed...directionless. I found myself very disappointed at the end, being left with little to no explanation for any of the events that transpired since they arrived at the mountain house. It feels as if they sort of forgot that the stalker was supposed to be an antagonist, and therefore an actual character. Instead he was used merely as a tool to make viewers piss themselves. Which I guess is alright, it definitely worked. But there was absolutely no development, or even explanation offered for any aspect of his character. All in all, this movie is worth the watch if you're looking for a beautifully shot movie or a really good scare, which of course is very important in a horror film.

There is a blockage in the basement that they imply the killer moves through, but it's just nonsensical for them to do so.\nThe script has the actors behaving in no way like actual human beings would in their circumstances. For instance, what kind of awful sister proposes that her sister stay alone in a huge house, but won't offer her one or two rooms in her own home? Whqt kind of person rich enough to own two homes wouldn't have spare rooms in their primary one?\nAre these people so awful that they have burned everyone they know and can only stay in a secluded mountain house?\nIt's all just nonsense, it has blatant tells, overused horror and suspense tropes and an awful, awful ending.\nI would have rather watched ten Steven Segal straight to dvds than this film once.",

And neither did any other character. I think the directors was just having a basic conversation about how \"weird\" open houses are and thought it would make a great esoteric horror flik. And I know they tried to hide who the killer was because \"you never know who comes to your open house\" except there were a total of like 6 characters and one of them happens to have found the cellphone. Even so what was the point of even watching when there was absolutely no chemistry between an of the actors and the decisions were so outside of normal human behavior. Like who doesn't notice someone next to you in a bed after getting up and going to the bathroom and laying down again and then looking at some cute photos of you sleeping.

In a great thriller/horror film, the conclusion is absolutely key, and it was completely absent in this film. The roles of the characters were also weak and confusing. There are obvious protagonists, however, the antagonist is never revealed, therefore the plot is completely lost. Other characters initially appeared to be round and dynamic characters in the beginning, and the viewer was led to believe that those characters would add to, enhance, or reveal key details of the plot, however, they never add anything further, and the film could have just as well have been made without these characters, and there would have been no difference in the way the plot played out.

            "content": "I don't typically write reviews of any kind, but considering how everyone and their dog is shitting on this movie I wanted to give it a go.  First of all, don't enter this movie expecting Oscar winning performances.  Actors, Dylan Minnette and Piercey Dalton play a fairly believable mother and son relationship.  In a few instances throughout the movie I could literally picture me and my mom having those exact conversations and arguments.  They weren't stellar performances, but they were organic enough for us, the audience, to trust and believe they were a mother and teenage son going through a difficult life transition.  As for the plot, its reminiscent of Disturbia.  Father dies tragically and the family tries to cope with their loss by going to stay at Naomi's (the mother) sister's place in the mountains while it is being sold, hence the title, The Open House.  They meet several characters that are strange, creepy and downright intrusive, and as the days go by weird things start to happen, such as, phones go missing, the water heater keeps turning off and a mysterious thumping sound can be heard coming from down in the basement.  Now this may raise alarm bells in most people, but Naomi is adamant about staying in the house, despite these \"happenings\" because she doesn't have the cash to put them up in a hotel for the night.  This leads to our inevitable night of terror for our guests.  The twist at the end may leave a bad taste in some people's mouths, but I say it works on two levels: 1. Violence can happen randomly, and 2. Some mysteries go unsolved.  I am not saying this ending or movie deserves an academy award, but it subverts our expectations and should be praised for giving us something new to chew on.  It's an average film with an exceptional ending that left me wondering what comes next.",

Not for any of the actual content but rather the idea that someone thought this was worth funding/releasing. Trying to capitilise on the '13 Reasons Why' gravy train, this blatant and horrific attempt to cash in on Dylan Minnette's growing popularity is an utter dumpster-fire of a movie. This 'notion' that a movie is going to be watchable solely on the basis it has someone people liked in another movie/show, therefore we should make it, is borderline stupidity and ruining the industry.    \n\nClassed as a 'horror/thriller' this movie represents a saddening new trend in the industry that needs to stop now. That being; how quickly and more importantly, how inexpensively can we make a movie? Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is fine, with some great camera work/choices at times. The location choices are often beautiful and capture some intrigue which is good.  It's not even the acting, which is fine as the actors display some good emotional depth when required; even if it's completely unwarranted and unjustified. \n\nThe most undeniable and indisputable issue with this movie is the writing/story. This is always a team issue an not solely on the 'writer' but I'm going to dissect a few key story issues that SHOULD of been addressed before/during filming/editing the final release.\n\nAbsurd Pedictability- \nThe lead is a long distance runner but let's give him contact lenses/glasses so we can include the cliché, where are my glasses/blurry vision gag.\nThe family is poor and can't pay their bills on time gag. \nThe foreshadowed camera work that gives away a character death before it's coming gag. \nThe completely unnessessarly death in the family to change the context/location gag. \nThe wealthier, more successful brother/sister family member offering their holiday home for respite gag. *Which is completely infuriating given the 'holiday home' is probably worth millions and at any time could she just give her sister some money to pay off the bills. Later in the movie, the mum can't pay for breakfast gag* \nThe huge, beautiful house, which is clearly recently upgraded/renovated with ridiculous malfunctioning internal problems gag* \nThe creepy basement with no light gag*\nThe creepy basement with a broken step gag*\nThe characters insane habit of never turning on any lights gag* (personally very infuriating) \nThe unexplained phenominon and the characters a) not discussing it openly and B) blaming each other to create mistrust gag*\n\nI could go on for hours but it's literally one issue after the next. Suffice to say, nothing in this movie portrays how normal, real-life people would act in these circumstances. What drives me insane is the stupidity of these characters in situations that are so easily resolved. A teenager loses his phone and just gives up looking after one short montage... come on... really... One more example, for my own pleasure. \n\nThe basement light isn't working and the step isn't repaired immediately even though they have weekly open-house viewings with a real-estate agent. Furthore more, the sister can afford to send a plumper the next day to fix the water problem, but doesn't want to pay the cost of a light bulb/wooden step and get that fixed at the same time.... \n\n Do not watch! Even to kill time! Leaves a bad taste in the mouth.",

This isn't their first attempt at the genre, but it is probably the best attempt.  (That isn't saying much thought.)  Spoilers ahead.\n\nFirstly, the story just isn't set up well from the get-go.  The intent of the plot in the beginning to build a small introduction to the characters really feels like it falls flat.  You could really skip the first 20 minutes of this movie and probably not suffer much for it later.  The whole dynamic of the dead father was just blah and a way to try and create an atmosphere of depression and grieving, but really fails to do so.\n\nOnce the 'Horror Movie Vibes' start to kick in a bit later into the movie, it doesn't seem to get much better.  There are times when you're curious as to why things are happening, that classic mystery appeal - unfortunately this suffers from being overly-cliche.  (I.e. objects mysteriously move between rooms).  We've seen it 1000x before in every horror movie, ever.  \n\nThe actual action/climax of the movie only lasts a short few minutes, and really doesn't do much but leave you wondering when there's going to be some plot continuation or explanation of what's going on.  You're basically waiting for those scenes to end, versus them being the highlight of the movie.  \n\nOnce the movie concludes it leaves you in a pretty rough place.  The main characters, who you will care so very little about, are dead - and you still don't know who killed them.  The end of the movie seems to imply a travelling serial killer, however they just don't capture the essence of the 'scary vagrant' archetype they were going for. \n\nThe only saving grace of the movie was that its music was pretty well done, and overall it was an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere (In contrast to many other horrors which are shot in gloomy, grimy or spooky settings.)   \n\nI can't really say I'd recommend it to anybody else, and will personally never rewatch it - but in hindsight it could have much worse.",

The car never shows up again, there is no link to the fate of the family. Car shown at the end is a completely different car. Fundamental horror film making mistake. (And I re-watched fast forward scene by scene too, looking for something I missed.)  Fate of son--why? He was already going to be blamed for the carnage, not an original plot but far more satisfying to the audience. The mother's sister--trying to get her sister killed? Why did she and her husband want to sell the house? Did they suspect something--but why would she want to stick the house on her sister?  We see nothing about their relationship to give us a hint. The \"crazy\" neighbor lady--what was the point of her existence in this film? And the helpful black man--dialogue, photography, sound effects trying to make him seem suspicious but then he's killed off without a single scene of his own; nothing but a plot point for the teen to react to. Lots of potential--good acting, family interaction--but poor writing, cliched direction/photography that manipulated the audience without any payoff, and an almost non-existent plot. Filmmakers need to read Truffaut's book on Hitchcock's cinema. Stringing together stereotypes, hackneyed horror chestnuts and cliches, pointless torture scenes does not a story make.",

Then they just got lazy and ended it with no explanation at all! They dragged the whole build up out so long and then rushed to a climax that just fizzled and made no sense. \n\nSo many questions were left unanswered. Why did Chris go into the basement all suspicious like? Why was everyone in the town weird? Why did creepy Alzheimer's chick come over every night except the one night they needed her? Who was the weird psycho in their house and why did he come? What ever happened to those cops that claimed they would return in the morning ? Why did the killer take his contacts and just let him go if he was planning on chasing him? What was this killers motive? Why would the killer eat cereal, take pictures of them and play games? I really wanted a scene where the killer just hashed out his plan.\n\nThe build up made it seem personal like the killer knew them, I thought they were going to have some reveal and that this guy would somehow be connected with the fathers death. That would have been great! \nOr at least to have some ending moment where you find out everything had a creepy explanation and the town was in on it, something creative , but no. They gave us nothing! \n\nHow can you work that hard on a film and then just give up the last 10 minutes!? It's like they wanted to avoid having the same old ending so they gave up.

We are introduced to a handful of characters and there's one that stands out: Martha. I ain't going to go too much into detail to avoid spoilers but I felt as if she was the reason for the plot. The killer is introduced early on but only with a shot of his boots. The director/camera people did a good job of emphasizing their angles to make sure the viewer remembers certain things, like the boots which end up appearing again with about 20 minutes left in the movie. Anyways, this woman Martha shows up at the most random times, and  is later revealed she has Alzheimer's. I though that was an important part once that was revealed but they did NOTHING with it. You think after all is said and done we would get more explanations to Martha's appearances or why a woman with Alzheimer's is living by herself but no. The ending will piss you off because its so f*cking vague. You are left with NO answers to questions and the most random fucking ending with NO context. Don't get me wrong, I love using context clues to find things out but you aren't given much and I have a guess to one of the questions I have but Im not even sure because it doesn't make sense. I'm not going to watch this movie again just to verify it. It did have me on edge though. This director did a good job with camera angles as mentioned and building up suspense but they could've done better. This movie could benefit from an extra 10-20 minutes to give it a proper open ending story but no. \n\nOne and a half stars for acting and movie direction but I'm going to need them to storm up a letter or something explaining the ending because I'm still at a lost for words.",

            "content": "We're in the risky month of January once again and when it comes to watching new releases in entertainment, it's usually a coin toss as to whether or not a movie will actually be good. Ever since Netflix began to release original films, I've found myself holding out hope that fantastic independent films will slowly begin to make their way onto streaming services, instead of failing at the box office. Well, if one of Netflix's most recent films in The Open House is any indication, then we're still a very long way from something like that ever happening. Not only is this one of the most non-scary horror films that I've seen in recent memory, but it's also one of the worst films in general that I've seen in recent memory. People talk about how bad a movie is, but sometimes it just has to be seen to be believed. Now streaming, here's why I think you should check this movie out just to see how bad it truly is.\n\nStarring Dylan Minnette and Piercey Dalton star in The Open House, a film that (after a tragic event) follows them as they work on selling their home. Shacking up in a family member's house up in the mountains while they set up open houses, creepy things begin to happen to them. What's disturbing them? Well, without giving anything away, literally nothing is ever explained to you throughout the movie. It's almost a joke that this film was even made because not a single portion of this movie is terrifying and not a single plot point is interesting enough to hold your attention for two seconds.\n\nLook, I've said this before, but it's really not necessary to make a horror movie to scare the hell out of someone because it's all about atmosphere and visuals. When the It hit theatres last year, it wasn't the kind of film that needed to throw scares in your face, because it focussed more on its characters and made you just care about watching these kids hang out and hope they all make it out of the film alive. So, when a movie like The Open House manages to simultaneously provide incredibly weak characters, laughably cheap set pieces, jump scares that you can see coming over ten minutes before they happen (and that's not even an exaggeration), and a conclusion that's pretty much a slap in the face to every viewer for even watching the movie, then I have nothing good to say about it.\n\nFrom the small films that Dylan Minnette has appeared in, to his larger role in last year's new series 13 Reasons Why, I've always enjoyed watching his performances, but even he was incredibly one-note here. Every time something would happen in their house that was supposed to trigger chills from the audience, it felt forced and quite honestly, every single set piece was a re-creation of another horror film. Yes, it's practically impossible to not draw inspiration from other movies these days, but The Open House just felt uninspired from start to finish.\n\nIn the end, I found myself chuckling if a character died, laughing hysterically at each jump scare, rolling my eyes when a new plot point arises that you already know the outcome to, or just plain being bored at the bland imagery. The funny thing is that this movie has an ending that I didn't exactly see coming, but the way it ends actually makes the movie worse than it already is. It's still very early in the year, but I'll be shocked if this doesn't stay my most hated movie of this year. The Open House is truly an awful film and unless you get a kick out of terrible horror films, then I would advise that you steer clear of this one.",

They do a good job in building that tension and making you wonder what exactly is going on. Most of the acting is strong, specially Dylan Minnette's (Logan) performance. The concept is chilling. The thought that someone has invaded your home, an unfamiliar one at that, and is stalking you with every vicious upper hand, is chilling. \n\nWeaknesses: Unfortunately, for the things it does right, this film misses the mark on a lot of other things. While the tension is palpable throughout, it comes via plenty of tropes we've seen done too often in horrors. Like the dark silhouette walking in the background. It feels lazy. Everything comes unraveled by the end of the film, because nothing gets resolved. I understand leaving stuff to the imagination or not explaining everything, but this movie gives you nothing. There's a weird old neighbor character, who could either by senile or in on what happens, yet we never find out. She's just a weird addition. The killer is never revealed and neither are his motivations. There's a part where Naomi (Logan's mother) angrily shouts about the deceased father not caring about them, yet never dives further into it. There are also multiple plot holes that damage the overall enjoyment of everything.\n\nOverall: I had high hopes for this after the trailer. There was even potential early on in the movie. But, too many clichés and nowhere near enough payoff really killed this. It makes everything before it pointless and you end up feeling like you wasted an hour and a half.",

            "content": "**spoilers ahead**I had to get a Rotten Tomatoes account specifically to review this movie. Dear Netflix, I appreciate the fact that you are diversifying your content with obscure and fresh films/television, but this film is 100% the worst I have ever seen. It started out very cliche with the death of a family member, a strained relationship, and the need to move somewhere new. At first, I respected the effective suspense that kept me ducking behind my blanket. After a while, however, I realized I was an hour into the movie and NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. Disappearing cell phones, possessed bowls of cereal, screwing with the water tank, and knocking noises from underneath the house for 80% of the movie?? And then the climax came followed by the infamous ending. No motive? No identified killer? Everyone dead? I was so angry/confused after viewing this film that I had to look at reviews because I thought that there had to be some alternate message that I was clearly not getting. Apparently, this was supposed to be a metaphor about the dangers of open houses and the fact that anyone can waltz right in and learn about you thorough your stuff... As being very familiar with the Real Estate Industry I can tell you that the open house in the film was conducted not even remotely close to how real open houses operate. You usually have to sign in, the agents follow you around the house (or are at least supposed to), and people can't just enter and exit from all entrances and exits that exist on the property, and that is all I will say about that. So the only metaphorical explanation that I found is ruled out. Keep in mind also that before the family even got to the house the \"man in black boots\" was standing in the middle of the road, so I guess he knew they were coming. Also, the movie poster says \"You can't lock out what's already inside.\" So the man was already there? THEN WHY IS THIS MOVIE CALLED THE OPEN HOUSE????? Additionally, in case you were going with the theory that was somewhat implied that the whole town was creepy and in on the murder plot and that this whole event was the result of a larger conspiracy, the very end of the movie rules that out too. The last two shots show, firstly, the house still with the door wide open and the car still with the lights and blinker on (and naturally the three dead bodies in the vicinity) so there wasn't clean up effort to make it look like nothing ever happened. Secondly, the random car driving up to the open house seems to imply that the passengers are the next victim, but they will be driving up to a murder scene, so that is not the case. Also, the shady police said that they would be returning in the morning, but instead, a random car is seen driving up to the house. Lastly, the real estate agents called the house sitter when the house was broken into, not the police. Okay... However, when Naomi and Logan arrived, there was staged, candle-lit table along with creepy music blasting. When did this happen? While the real estate agents were there? Was it like that when they got there? Why didn't THEY call the police? Basically, there was no plot, then when the writers decided to have plot, IT MADE NO F***ING SENSE! To sum it up, the movie is just stereotypes, implied plots, pointless suspense, failed metaphors, irrational behavior, a horrible, illogical, and confusing ending, unanswered questions, and a BIG FAT WASTE OF YOUR TIME DO NOT SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THE TORTURE OF WATCHING THIS MOVIE.",
