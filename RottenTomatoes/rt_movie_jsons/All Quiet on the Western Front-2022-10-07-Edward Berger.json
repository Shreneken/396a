            "content": "All Quiet on the Western Front 2022 is a German-language adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's classic anti-war novel, which follows the experiences of a young soldier named Paul B\u00e4umer on the Western Front during World War I. Directed by Edward Berger, the film stars Felix Kammerer as Paul, Albrecht Schuch as his mentor Kat, and Daniel Br\u00fchl as a school official who encourages Paul and his friends to enlist.\n\nThe film is faithful to the source material, capturing the horror, futility, and tragedy of war through Paul's eyes. The cinematography by James Friend is stunning, creating a contrast between the bleak and muddy trenches and the idyllic countryside that Paul longs for. The film also adds a parallel storyline that shows the armistice negotiations to end the war, which provides some historical context and a sense of irony.\n\nThe acting is superb, especially by Kammerer and Schuch, who convey the bond between Paul and Kat as they face death and despair together. Br\u00fchl is also effective as the patriotic teacher who later regrets his influence on his students. The film does not shy away from showing the brutality and violence of war, as well as its psychological impact on the soldiers. The film also explores themes such as friendship, loyalty, innocence, and humanity in the midst of chaos.\n\nThe film is not without flaws, however. The film is long, running at 147 minutes, and some scenes feel repetitive or unnecessary. The film also suffers from some pacing issues, especially in the second half, where it loses some of its momentum and emotional impact. The film could have benefited from some editing and trimming to make it more concise and focused.\n\nOverall, All Quiet on the Western Front 2022 is a powerful and poignant film that honors its source material and delivers a strong anti-war message. It is one of the best war films of recent years, and deserves to be seen by a wide audience. The film has received critical acclaim and several awards nominations, including Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars.",

The acting was amazing, the effects was absolutely wonderfull and the make-up was one of the best I have ever seen! The twists were awesome still I can't explain how he survived attacked by a bomb and how he walked even stabbed in the heart! I loved the story! It made me laugh, cry and question myself in only 2 hours and a half! All actors played it really good! This movie really helps us understand what happen and how people were tortured and that we shouldn't repeat others mistakes! Even if the story is old we can still see how it affects us in the present! The movie was one of the best I ve ever seen! The storyline, the effects (some of them were just master s touch). I definately recommend this movie! It's a 10/10 for me!",

In my opinion the movie failed to nail the topic, it explains nothing and just claims that war is a fatality like a \"fever\". But this is just plain wrong, war is not a fatality, and if the people could see who's pulling the strings, then they would no longer fight those wars.

I restanti 135 minuti si fanno ricordare per una fantastica inconcludenza, un lento alternarsi di scene tragiche a scene insensatamente leggere, e un delizioso quanto irragionevole, altalenante e a tratti fastidioso sviluppo dei personaggi.  Bellissimi i toni della pallicola e la regia e crudezza delle scene d'azione, fantastici elementi che corniciano un'opera priva di vera sostanza emotiva, ma carica di banalit\u00e0.

You also see the contrast between those for whom war and the pursuit of victory is an abstraction and those who have to fight it. There must must have been debate about how much gore an audience can tolerate so you see no limbs blown off, no spilled guts etc. some niggles: at times the music is intrusive and unnecessary, it's a little overlong and the end succumbs to melodrama.

            "content": "Films based on real life wars, while excelling with the film-making aspects, also exude sadness, despair and sometimes even trauma. In that sense, this one isn't any different and has to be watched keeping all those factors in mind.\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\", a German film, finds itself in a league of recent war-based predecessors like \"1917\", \"Dunkirk\" and classics like \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"The Thin Red Line\", \"Full Metal Jacket\", \"Platoon\" and even \"Apocalypse Now\". I would be damned if I didn't mention Spielberg's classic series \"Band of Brothers\" in that list.\nIn fact, the story based on the 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque with the same name has been brought to the silver screen before \u2013 once as an Oscar winning feature film in 1930 and then as a TV film in 1979. While most of the main characters remain constant, there are subtle variations in the on-screen depictions, albeit retaining the painful ironies of war in the story.\nOne could say this is a perspective from the opposite side of the trenches to that of the saga depicted in the acclaimed film \"1917\" (2019), another World War I story. \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" follows a German youth's journey into the throes of war, with the zest of patriotism and an almost delusional enthusiasm, that blinds out the deadly consequences of a conflict.\nHe soon descends into the dark chasm of war as they get closer to the battlefront and combat in the trenches, and it isn't too far in days, months or even years for him to transition into a futile, brainwashed soldier conflicted with his humane instincts.\nAs one would expect, the locations and set production is intricate taking you right into the blend of gorgeous fields, forests and the corpse stricken battlefield, engulfed in mist and smoke. The set design and cinematography deservedly took home top accolades at the 95th Academy awards, besides being recognized as the best International feature film and a haunting score that enlivens the doom of war, by Volker Bertelmann. And Edward Berger's direction is laudable.\nThe young Felix Kammerer immerses himself into a journey that takes him from a na\u00efve youth to being a bayonet stabbing soldier, Paul and Albrecht Schuch as the other key protagonist and a sort of mentor is as intense. Daniel Br\u00fchl is easily recognizable for the global audience in that role of a struggling German diplomat, and so is Sebastian H\u00fclk from \"Dark\", that iconic drama that was built around temporal loops and parallel universes before that theme really went into overkill in recent films.\nA gem that came through and was produced by Netflix, it is best watched in the original German audio with subtitles. A brush through about the first war in the 20th century would definitely throw some light on the background of the events in the film.\nWars and national conflicts have always risen from the depths of political agendas, driven by ego and the hunger to expand an elusive border or even stamp a barbaric foot of authority between countries. This story re-emphasizes the fact that war has been, and will always remain a futile act of genocide.",

The music manages to be obnoxious and conceptually boring at the same time with some irritating stunts that want to be smart but are just how the composer says: 'hey, look at me!'. Guess it worked, the score won an Oscar. The Academy is very, very smart.\n\nThis movie on the narrative side is really not just bad but annoyingly sleazy. It likes the idea of being a deep, edgy war movie but does not want to do the intellectual leg work to be it. I think the praise has to do with many people being uninformed about the subject matter and basically just trusting the movie to depict it from a valid angle. It doesn't. Remarque's novel does, but this movie basically just doesn't like Remarques novel and WW1 in general and basically takes the valuable brand name and historical premise, says 'thank you'  to then tell its own dumbed down version of 'war is hell, man' with some elements you know from the Great War: there's trenches, there's artillery, there's tanks, there's mutilated bodies but not even the warfare is depicted with any amount of care, it's more informed by action films than by actual events. It's not shaped by any kind of directorial voice, unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, PATHS OF GLORY, THIN RED LINE or Lewis Milestone's version of AQOTWF from the 1930s. There was nobody in the story department who had anything to say, but they made a movie anyway. Then Netflix threw some money at it, made it look like a proper war movie, told the filmmakers to say something that sounds profound in 12th grade history class and went off to win some Oscars. They could do that because no WW1 veteran is alive anymore to spit on the ground in front of them. And I guess they wouldn't even care.",

            "content": "\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is based on the 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque, who was a German foot soldier on the western front during World War I.  (The \"front\" stretched from the west coast of Belgium through Germany's western border with France down to the border of neutral Switzerland.)  The book was the best-selling novel in the US in its year of publication and sold 1.5 million copies worldwide in its first eighteen months.  In 1930, an American adaptation of the book won Best Picture at the third Academy Awards.\nLike the novel, this film traces the story of Paul B\u00e4umer and his friends, who join the German war effort in 1917 in a fit of patriotic fervor.  Almost immediately, the realities of life \u2013 and death \u2013 on the front expose the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the characters' initial expectations.    \nThe major theme of this film is the futility of war.  As the film concludes, story cards inform us that between 1913 and 1917, there were over two million casualties along the western front, even though the territorial lines moved less than 200 meters.  In fact, \"all quiet on the western front\" is now a euphemism for stagnation.\nCowriter/Director Edward Berger departs from the narrative of the novel by inserting a storyline about Matthias Erzberger, the German diplomat who negotiated (or acquiesced to) an armistice with the French.  While these scenes offer stark contrast to the war footage (at one point, the French general worries that the croissants are not truly fresh), this subplot is a misguided distraction.\nBerger's creative team is excellent.  Cinematographer James Friend and Composer Volker Bertelmann deserve special mention.  Friend's graphic set pieces on the battlefield and his lingering shots of untouched natural scenery create an effectively eerie juxtaposition.  His washed-out color palette ironically makes the horrors on the screen even more vivid.  For his part, Bertelmann employs snare drums and a three-note motif using a harmonium to jolt the moviegoer and create a pervasive, bone-deep sense of dread.\nThis film effectively communicates the realities of the western front and, more generally, WW I from a German perspective.  Since \"history is written by the victors,\" the suffering on the German side has often gone unacknowledged.  Early on, there are poignant scenes of German soldiers removing boots and clothing from the dead.  The apparel is then transported back to German factories where it is washed, repaired and presented to recruits as \"new\" uniforms.  \nThe flaw here is that \"All Quiet\" is basically a series of memorable images.  Unlike Sam Mendes' film \"1917,\" there's no powerful narrative to fully immerse us in the events that are unfolding.  The only dramatic tension is whether the war will end before all the key characters die.  One horror simply piles onto the next, frame after frame, day after day.  And while some of these scenes are quite striking, (the imagery of advancing allied battle tanks and soldiers with flamethrowers looks truly terrifying from the other side), we come away shell-shocked but emotionally disengaged.",

The end itself doesn't line up with the very title of the movie.  It was certainly not quiet at the front when Paul was killed and shows that the screenwriter or the director or whomever wanted to end on an epic finale when in reality the end of the war came at a whimper.  It's also offensive in that the book is definitely an anti-war piece and this bombastic ending feels more like it's glorifying war in contrast to the rest of the film.\n\nDespite how much the ending bothers me, I still think the movie as a whole is pretty good.  There was definitely a lot of attention to detail and the movie went out of its way to show how fucked up war is and how it tears people down both literally and mentally.  Definitely something to watch if you're a history nerd like me.",

All the lights, scenes, shots, colors and everything was just absolutely stunning. \n\nThe sound was very next level. This is something I barely notice most of the time, but it felt so different in this movie. The sound just seemed to feel stronger and intense. The sound of bullets, \n\nThe makeup is also something that stood out to me. There was one scene in particular that really resonated with me. The scene where Paul is in the trench after crossing to the French side, and he has a mixture of grass and dirt on his face. The green in the grass stood out and almost made him look like Groot.\n\nThe film really emphasizes just how horrible war is. To begin, the uniforms they receive are from dead soldiers. Any food they eat, is almost like a feast for them. They see so many deaths at such a rapid pace, and become desensitized to it all. So much suffering on both sides. All the dead bodies piled up, is really a sight to see. \n\nAll the actors did a phenomenal job. They played their roles perfectly. Everyone had great chemistry together, especially Paul and Tjaden. I loved how their friendship played out. Kudos to the casting director. \n\nThe movie has a nice pace to it. There are breaks from the actual war, so it's not always boom boom boom. \n\nThe war ends for everyone, but the Germans weren't so lucky. The ending to this was just gut wrenching. Like seriously? At that point in time? Horrible luck. \n\nThis film will stand the test of time and will forever be great. All the factors that play into what a \"great movie\" is, this film has it. \n\nThis gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 10/10",

            "content": "\"All Quiet on The Western Front\" is a film that left me conflicted. Initially, it came across as a stark and emotionless portrayal of war that left no one spotless. Unlike other historical war films, it doesn't depict the soldiers as valiant or patriotic. Instead, it shows the futility of war, the loss of youth, and the corruption of innocence with an unsettling lack of emotion throughout. The characters are naive and impressionable young men who have mindlessly partaken in the unwarranted military occupation of foreign land, where they are obviously not welcome by the inhabitants. They are not fighting for glory or honor, but for their survival.\n\nWhile this inability to sympathize with the characters is irksome, it is intentional, as the film tells the story from the perspective of the vanquished, not the conquerors. The recruits were fatally misled in conscripting themselves and their families, and once they arrived at the front, they were gradually numbed to their feelings by the constant mental and physical anguish inflicted upon them. However, this noticeable detachment from the characters featured results in a somewhat muted response when they are chewed up and spat out by the gratuitous violence they are repeatedly thrust into by the callous, cowardly officers. Despite this, the film does accurately reflect how Germany treated its own people, offering up generations of its future citizens on the battlefield as sacrificial lambs, massacred at the altar of a poisonous, nationalistic ideology. Boys were essentially reduced to nothing but disposable, unimportant objects, thoughtlessly discarded and simply replaced in a sadistic game and quest for absolute power. The movie lenses the apathy of the superiors through a perspective of rightful, scornful contempt.\n\nOverall, the film achieves its goal in a commendably brutal and unflinching manner. It shows the utter, irredeemable meaninglessness and the wanton, senseless destruction of war. While it may leave the viewer with a cynical, bitter, and despondent conclusion, it is an understandably accurate portrayal of the carnage we observe. It also shows one massive miscalculation on the side of the victors, forcing the Germans into reluctant submission and backing them into signing an agreement with terms they couldn't accept, ultimately entrenching resentful animosity that would act as a spark to light the fire of the Second World War.",

Writing, directing, editing, acting, sound, cinematography, art direction/set decoration coalesce to create an incredibly apt, authentic, convincing drama on the horrors, the hell, the hopelessness of such slaughter on the fields of battle. \nFelix Kammerer gave a commanding performance in the lead of Paul B\u00e4umer- so set on getting to the front, then Paris, and proving family wrong. But then so shattered by the realities of war and the sham rhetoric of them acting as heroes for the fatherland. \nSchuch, Hilmer, Hasanovich, and Klaus as well give strong performances as B\u00e4umer's fellow soldiers/friends. \nThe pacing worked well throughout, for the quiet, introspective parts as well as the battle scenes. The film didn't feel like 120+ minutes. Even scenes like B\u00e4umer and Kat at the farm house, desperate for food. \nThe look of the film brought to mind Spielberg, Blossier, and Malick. The long, long skies looming above in varying shades of blues, white, grays together with the realism of the trenches and muddy ground, keep the sense of foreboding and an early demise alive throughout. \nCredit also to the fine work of the makeup artists and visual effects crew to put us in the world and hold us there to the end.\n4.3 stars",

The blame, however, does not solely lie with the poor directorial choices and budget allocation, but also with Netflix's commercialization of the movie.\n\nThe film's story has been altered in ways that serve no purpose and only serve to alienate the original book. The pseudo-historical events depicted in the movie, such as the peace-agreement between Germany and France, are a disgrace to the depth and nuance of Remarque's work. These changes make no sense and leave viewers questioning the plot and its execution.\n\nThe 1930 adaptation of the novel was a masterpiece, with superior artistic vision and direction, which makes this recent adaptation all the more frustrating. The poor allocation of budget and mismanagement by the director are evident in the lack of proper representation of war. The scenes that are meant to depict war come off as cheap and superficial, lacking any real substance or depth.\n\nThe actors' performances are commendable, but they are let down by the absurdity of the script. The peace-agreement and negotiations between Germany and France, though they did take place historically, had no place or mention in the book.

For the first time in history, there is a high probability that a German film (produced by Netflix, a very relevant detail) will win the category for the best picture. Indeed \"All quiet on the western front\" is probably the only candidate which can gather an unanimous consensus among the voters: thanks to his superb direction, which shows us not only the tranches but even the landscape around (i.e. the opening scenes), his brutal score, mechanic and artificial, and his allucinating cinematography (especially in yellow tones, on which James Friend manipulates the light in a terrific way), the film succeeds in taking the viewer into the last period of the WWI, both in tranches and train carriages where it was signed the ceasefire between Germany and France. It shows the horrific distance between the soldiers and the diplomatic delegation, thanks to a wonderful and raw montage that shifts amid the luxuorius breakfast eaten by generals and the mud and rain in the tranches. This film is able to reach directly the heart of the spectator, while \"1917\", the big loser of 2019's Oscar, due to too many techincal tricks, doesn't. To conclude, there is another aspect of the film that really impressed me: at the end in fact, the director seems to remember to all of us that the destiny, or the providence, or the call of God, or whatever we decide to name it, overcome war and human decisions; when our turn arrives, there's nothing we can do to escape. Utterly powerful. 12/03 update: I was completely wrong.",

It is tragic that in 2023 people are sent to their deaths for the egos of so called leaders of countries.  Its inconceivable as to how any nation can lie to its people in the same way that in 1914 resulted in the deaths of 17 million people, lives of the survivors ruined.

The film continues with similar snide and aloof dialogue paired with intricately-horrifying-battle-scene after intricately-horrifying-battle-scene. In contrast, the audience is offered brief glimpses into impressively-mustached commanders' hearty dinner tables, where they're eating chicken, completely oblivious to the mortal devastation going on just outside their window. Then again: more fighting, death, mud, and people staring off into space.\n\nThe nihilistic principles that this film took 2 hours and 45 minutes to portray are as follows:\nWar sucks.\nPeople suck.\nAnd what's even the f***ing point?\n\nWhen making a statement on the woes of war, if you want to offer meaning behind the horrific realities, it's important to tell the whole story rather than just part of it. In this case, the film neglected to represent other key-concepts of war: camaraderie, honor, belief \u2014 Without the contrast of these core principles, the shell-shock the actors so-beautifully portrayed was distant and un-relatable, and the intricate battles were aimless and cold.\n\nApparently, our only hope is to grow an impressive mustache and hope for the best.\n\nI am sad.

This war film - is it an adaptation, a remake or a completely fresh take? - manages to restate that old truth, and finds reasons for the message's fresh urgency. \n\nThese are not only the ongoing war in Ukraine, but in a skilful way, the film weaves throughout its length a depiction of the vicious circle of toxic nationalism and industrialised militarism. One can't survive without the other, and how they constantly feed on each other is especially chilling in the light of events we're watching play out on the news not only from Ukraine but from wherever the spirit of nationalism energies the military-industrial complex. \n\nIt's a remarkably made film on almost every level - writing, acting, and every technical aspect. The score haunts and chills with percussive beats, and insistent drones; colours in and around the battlefield are almost perpetually washed out and presented with a metallic, industrial patina. On more than one occasion a trick of make-up or cinematography leads to a sense that the dead appear to be alive, the living seems dead. Back in headquarters, the colours are as bright as they are drained at the front; the food as rich as it is scarce for the soldiers. The tank attack on German trenches is especially hard to watch - the sequence of tanks rolling across and into an open trench of soldiers is as frightening as anything I've seen in a long time; not just for the violence it depicts, but also for the horrified faces of those who look down the trench at their companions being crushed and see everything that's coming to them. \n\nThe climactic German decision to walk into battle fifteen minutes before the Armistice comes into effect seems both as stupid as it was and entirely in keeping with what has come before; the ultimate hard-sell of nationalism's false gospel, the relentless need to feed the military machine as it gorges on young lives and a ruined natural world. The land that is meant to feed and nurture life is the killing floor of a personalised, mechanised descent into a hell that pays well for those a thousand miles away.\n\nLike many films which tell such resonant stories, it remains hard to objectively judge All Quiet On The Western Front. It's most certainly a film that has found its time, and deserves the wide audience it is exposed to on Netflix; though one can't also help thinking this would be all the more overwhelmingly intense on a big screen. Upsetting, intimate, visceral and horrifying, it remains an all too human tragedy that there is no film this year more urgent than this.",

            "content": "\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" opens on an obliterated battlefield somewhere in the European countryside with smooth camerawork that throws audiences into the macabre and destructive reality of World War 1. The chilling scene follows a young German soldier as he is forced over the top of the trenches into no man's land, and to his premature death. Director Edward Berger's adaptation marks the third time Erich Maria Remarque's book, which was inspired by his own experiences as a German soldier during World War 1, has been adapted for the big screen, with directors Lewis Milestone and Delbert Mann each bringing their own version of the novel to life.\n\nLike the novel of the same name, \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" tells the story of a young Paul B\u00e4umer (Felix Kammerer) as he and his friends, blinded by heroic aspirations and childish naivety, sign up to fight in World War 1. Heads filled with dreams to serve the fatherland and return as heroes, the boys soon arrive on the frontline, but what they see immediately upends every expectation they had about the war, as the dreams quickly fade into a vicious fight for survival. Determined to make it out of the waterlogged trenches and away from the ravaged battlefields of the European countryside, Paul and his friends fight tooth and nail in order to survive. While on the other side of it all, safe and dry in the comfort of luxurious train carriages, German diplomats negotiate with the French in order to stop the war once and for all. But as Paul sees his friends slowly picked off one by one, the chaos and devastation of the war soon begin to hit home for Paul, as he is forced to come to terms with the harsh reality of conflict. \nWhile this adaptation, written by Berger alongside Lesley Paterson and Ian Stockell, does for the most part follow the narrative of Remarque's novel, he leaves out multiple parts, and changes bits and pieces throughout. Berger also decides to change the ending from the one in the book, and luckily for Berger it works in his favour, making the final scene in the film an emotional gut-punch just like the ending in the novel. Remarque's novel also doesn't include any sort of political negotiations as seen in the film, but these scenes do allow for a stark contrast between the violence and mess of battle, and the decadence and luxury of politics, making way for a strong performance by Daniel Br\u00fchl. Berger also shifts focus in the film away from Paul, unlike Remarque's novel which focuses almost entirely on Paul and his first-hand experience of the war. Despite deviating from the source material, \"All Quiet of the Western Front\" still manages to be a stellar adaptation of an incredibly well written novel from nearly 100 years ago. The film is led by a stellar (and BAFTA-nominated) directorial effort from Berger as he miraculously crafts a compelling film from a dark, deeply disturbing story.\nVolker Bertelmann provides \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" with a score that is both menacing, poignant, and with a booming tone paired with the delicate sounds of a violin and a sprinkle of drums. Bertelmann's work feels like strong competition for Justin Hurwitz's luscious score for Damien Chazelle's 1920s Hollywood epic \"Babylon\" in the 2023 Oscar's race. While the film may be a technical marvel, it also features some sensational performances from it's entire ensemble. Felix Kammerer makes his acting debut with the film, delivering a powerful performance that effortlessly balances the mindset of a soldier deep in the trenches with inexperience, and the innocence of a boy thrown into the deep of the conflict. Kammerer's performance highlights the trauma and terror these soldiers were forced to experience, while also acting as a lifeline for viewers in the midst of the conflict. Albert Schuch brings the character of Stanislaus Katcinzinsky, a soldier alongside the four friends, to the screen. The German actor delivers a remarkable performance that tells a completely different story to the frightened performances given by Felix Kammerer, Aaron Hilmer, Mortiz Klaus, and Adrien Gr\u00fcnewald.\n\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is a film powered by its impressive technicality with the complex performances given by the cast, and a star-making debut from Felix Kammerer. Edward Berger crafts an immensely emotional, and impactful piece of cinema that feels worthy of all of the accolades it has received. Erich Maria Remarque's novel is a perfect film to be adapted for the big screen, and even with the new additions and subtractions from Berger, Paterson, and Stokell, it makes for an incredibly entertaining war flick. This is a film that takes its audiences on a journey through grief, conflict, chaos and the horrors of World War 1. \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is an incredibly powerful film, led by an equally powerful performance from Felix Kammerer, director Edward Berger crafts a devastatingly beautiful film from Erich Maria Remarque's absorbing novel.",

            "content": "\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" opens on an obliterated battlefield somewhere in the European countryside with smooth camerawork that throws audiences into the macabre and destructive reality of World War 1. The chilling scene follows a young German soldier as he is forced over the top of the trenches into no man's land, and to his premature death. Director Edward Berger's adaptation marks the third time Erich Maria Remarque's book, which was inspired by his own experiences as a German soldier during World War 1, has been adapted for the big screen, with directors Lewis Milestone and Delbert Mann each bringing their own version of the novel to life.\n\nLike the novel of the same name, \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" tells the story of a young Paul B\u00e4umer (Felix Kammerer) as he and his friends, blinded by heroic aspirations and childish naivety, sign up to fight in World War 1. Heads filled with dreams to serve the fatherland and return as heroes, the boys soon arrive on the frontline, but what they see immediately upends every expectation they had about the war, as the dreams quickly fade into a vicious fight for survival. Determined to make it out of the waterlogged trenches and away from the ravaged battlefields of the European countryside, Paul and his friends fight tooth and nail in order to survive. While on the other side of it all, safe and dry in the comfort of luxurious train carriages, German diplomats negotiate with the French in order to stop the war once and for all. But as Paul sees his friends slowly picked off one by one, the chaos and devastation of the war soon begin to hit home for Paul, as he is forced to come to terms with the harsh reality of conflict. \n\nWhile this adaptation, written by Berger alongside Lesley Paterson and Ian Stockell, does for the most part follow the narrative of Remarque's novel, he leaves out multiple parts, and changes bits and pieces throughout. Berger also decides to change the ending from the one in the book, and luckily for Berger it works in his favour, making the final scene in the film an emotional gut-punch just like the ending in the novel. Remarque's novel also doesn't include any sort of political negotiations as seen in the film, but these scenes do allow for a stark contrast between the violence and mess of battle, and the decadence and luxury of politics, making way for a strong performance by Daniel Br\u00fchl. Berger also shifts focus in the film away from Paul, unlike Remarque's novel which focuses almost entirely on Paul and his first-hand experience of the war. Despite deviating from the source material, \"All Quiet of the Western Front\" still manages to be a stellar adaptation of an incredibly well written novel from nearly 100 years ago. The film is led by a stellar (and BAFTA-nominated) directorial effort from Berger as he miraculously crafts a compelling film from a dark, deeply disturbing story.\n\nVolker Bertelmann provides \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" with a score that is both menacing, poignant, and with a booming tone paired with the delicate sounds of a violin and a sprinkle of drums.

Frequently, I turn away to avoid the pain. Hubster, who is a military veteran, says he found himself somewhat disinterested.

            "content": "A few years ago, I was on a quest to watch every Best Picture Oscar winner that I hadn't seen yet, and that endeavour proved to be a mixed bag. One of the numerous highlights was watching Lewis Milestone's anti-war epic All Quiet On The Western Front. Brutal, visceral and with themes that will never not be relevant and powerful, it was an incredibly rewarding watch. 2022's adaptation of the classic novel got a lot of buzz around awards season, and it had some big shoes to fill. Luckily, Edward Berger had the confidence and the ability to make an adaptation that's both difficult to watch and impossible to look away from. It's got gorgeous cinematography, which often clashes right up against the film's haunting visuals and deliberate ugliness. The performances are incredible, especially Felix Kammerer in the lead role, playing a character who slowly and irreversibly loses his sanity through years of attrition and suffering. The shots on his face demonstrate both his physical and mental deterioration, and it's a truly heart-breaking performance that will likely define his career for year to come. I don't understand the backlash the film's received, with people saying it doesn't capture the spirit of the novel, which dealt with the dehumanisation of soldiers through constant battles and endless bloodshed, as well as criticising the selfish and power-hungry army generals who are content to feed thousand of young fellow countrymen to the wolves it if means gaining a few inches of ground. The film does all of this and does it well. Something this film disappointingly lacks is any coverage of the soldiers when they get back home and are hailed as heroes, but never feel like it. It's some of the most power material the 1930 film had, but this new version is more focused on the war itself, rather than its aftermath. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since it covers the fighting so well, but it's an integral part of the whole picture that I think should have been included. With that being said, this was a truly gripping viewing experience, directed brilliantly, acted perfectly, visually stunning and emotionally resonant. It does things better than the 1930 version and it does things worse, but when judged solely on its own merits, I think its one of the best films released in 2022, and one of the best war films I've seen for a very long time.",

Without having seen the prior adaptations, I was impressed by this story of a group of young men enlisting to fight for their country, only to be exposed to the true horrors of war. Following the main character Paul, the physical and psychological tolls of war became very evident as he transformed from a bright, happy kid with fresh skin and clean hair, to a dull, empty young man with sunken eyes, a muddy face, and a lifeless expression.\n\nThe combat scenes were excellent. Each scene had an element of tension as German soldiers fell to the better-equipped French army on almost every occasion. The mental effects of the war were especially well-depicted; soldiers were shown in heavy psychological struggle as combat and death became their day-to-day, and they had to come to terms with the extreme actions they were forced to take.\n\nI felt the film fell a little short in how it tried to weave in the contrast between the dirty and dilapidated front-line soldiers and the well-dressed, well-fed higher-ups with their negotiations. I can appreciate the purpose of adding this more political narrative on the side, but I felt these scenes were very slow-paced and a little too much of a contrast from the tension of the action scenes. I was pulled away, having to then rebuild the tension each time we returned to the front line.\n\nA great anti-war film that leaves you thinking, what was this all for? - 7/10",

            "content": "War movies aren't normally my thing, so the only time I watch them is when they're Oscar-nominated and it's a genre they love honoring again and again, from the recent Dunkirk and 1917 right back to the first film based on Erich Remarque's novel, which actually won Best Picture in 1930. Now, we have Edward Berger's new adaptation, a technically impressive film that spares us no details in its graphic and uncompromising portrayal of the brutality and inhumanity of war, even when his camera finds occasional beauty amongst the horrors, but is always conscious of its central, timeless and oh-so-familiar message regarding the futility (and randomness) of war. Beginning with someone whom viewers might think is one of the main characters charging haplessly into battle, only to find that this is only a prologue foreshadowing the fate of a quartet of young and ill-prepared German recruits whose initial naive enthusiasm will quickly turn far too real and calamitous once they reach the front line, the film elegantly sets the stage for their harrowing experience in the trenches of WWI whilst intercutting with Daniel Bruhl (whose presence seems mandatory in any Germanic film) as the diplomat representing the new German government desperately negotiating a ceasefire with the French. More advanced technology the filmmakers now have at their disposal aside, the other justification for this remake is that this is the first German and German-made adaptation which inevitably carries extra weight and poignancy. Beautifully and convincingly played by a cast of fresh young faces, especially Felix Kammerer who's the viewers' surrogate, and a screenplay that has time to juxtapose the sickening disparity between the starving soldiers and the luxury their commanding officers wallow in, Berger's film deserves all the nominations it has amassed, but it's too traumatic for a re-watch anytime soon.",

The harshness of war is tempered by the bonds of friendship at the core of this movie, followed swiftly by the crushing desolation left behind.\n\nFelix Kammerer (Paul) and Albrecht Schuch (Kat) give remarkable performances even though there isn't much speaking on their side of the plot. But the thousand-yard stares, punctuated by quick bursts of exuberance and even pathos really convey the horror and hell they're going through even as Daniel Br\u00fchl's Erzberger works on an armistice. \n\nWhile the movie feels overlong in parts, with lingering shots on various despondent soldiers or mangled corpses driving the point home more than is necessary. But when that repeated music sting kicks in you can almost feel your stomach drop knowing nothing good is coming, nor will it ever come for 99% of the cast.",

It follows the life of an idealistic young German soldier, who after enlisting in the German Army with his friends, finds himself exposed to the realities of war, shattering his early hopes of becoming a hero as he does his best to survive. It's terribly cruel and gory, as all wars are, and it perfectly recreates the horrors of this bloody miserable war, which killed 17 million people over 4 years. The fact that the Germans decided to produce the movie themselves gives the story a more realistic approach and it is incredibly moving and sad. The score pulls at one's heartstrings and it is visually very impressive.",

            "content": "Adapted from Erich Maria Remarque's 1929 novel of the same name, All Quiet on the Western Front is an astonishing anti-war film that establishes the events of World War One from a German's perspective. The story follows German student Paul B\u00e4umer, who goes to war with his friends in hopes of gaining glory and honour when they return home from the Front. After months of propaganda and patriotic speeches, the boys begin the journey to Northern France. The true horrors of trench warfare, however, shatter their romanticised view of the war and leave them traumatised. After an infantry offensive and a major gas attack on their first day, the boys are horrified by what lies ahead.\n\nThe film itself was produced in Germany and the cast is not as recognisable as other war films I had previously watched such as Dunkirk and 1917, especially with those featuring some of my favourite actors such as Andrew Scott and Benedict Cumberbatch, who have become household names for people in the UK. All Quiet on the Western Front, however, blew these two films out of the water. The casting was phenomenal, especially Felix Kammerer, who played the protagonist. His emotional range throughout this film is an absolute whirlwind and is guaranteed to keep you hooked throughout the whole movie.\n\nOne of my favourite scenes is when Kammerer's character Paul takes down a French soldier while retreating to the German trenches. Paul is seen watching him bleed out, but soon regrets what he has done and cannot bare to watch someone die because of him. He becomes hysterical and desperately tries to stop his bleeding to no avail. Upon his death, Paul finds a picture of a woman and a little girl in his pocket, who he soon realises to be the man's wife and child. He becomes inconsolable and lies beside the solider as he sobs with regret, realising that he has torn apart a family. This scene is incredibly powerful and highlights the fragility of life on the battlefield as well as the regrets that many faced by the men of the war. Kammerer's performance truly adds a heart-breaking feel to this scene that wouldn't be the same without him.\n\nIt's also interesting to see Paul's overall character development throughout the film. As someone who never read the original novel, I didn't know what to expect when this film was originally suggested to me. Paul starts as an enthusiastic and honest young teen, who is ready to do anything for his country, but he is left broken by war and completely unrecognisable by the end. This also adds to the tear-jerking ending of this film, which I will not spoil.\n\nHowever, one major part of this film is its shock-factor. The gore and the grittiness of this film is something that cannot be ignored and was truly unexpected in my opinion. In films like Dunkirk and 1917, the gore is not a notable part of their narratives, it mainly focuses on their storyline. However, All Quiet on the Western Front plays mostly off its gore, with some truly horrifying images with are honestly haunting. For example, there is a particular scene that spring to mind where the Germans are under attack from allied forces, who are using tanks. The allies not only unload major artillery on the Germans but also run straight over their trenches. As disgusting as it sounds, you physically see the mangling of people under the tires of tanks, and it is truly horrifying to watch. So much so that when I suggested my friend watch this film, she called me in utter shock at what she had just seen. I would truly say this film is not for people with weak stomachs, but it only adds to the truth of this horrifying war. I do promise that this film is not all gory, some light-hearted scenes fill you with hope, such as the boys robbing a farm or their flirting with passing French female civilians. This film truly encompasses all elements of war.\n\nOverall, this movie is an absolute masterpiece and is undoubtedly one of the grittiest, yet most accurate war films I have ever seen. I adored this film and honestly see no way it could have improved.",

            "content": "All Quiet on the Western Front is a dark, gritty, and depressing look at what the effects of war and propaganda have on the soldiers who enlist.\n\nOur main characters enter the front all bright eyed and bushy tailed excited to fight for Germany, mainly due to them being naive about what war is truly like. That optimism is soon destroyed in the first minutes of reaching the battlefields as they are hit with mortar strikes that kill countless numbers of their comrades. This is where we first get to see the incredible emotion portrayed in this film. The actors do so much with just their facial expressions to demonstrate their mental decay as the turmoil of war inflict their damage.\n\nThere is a constant theme of the destruction of peace throughout the entire film, whether be the peace of Germany as a whole due to the lackluster treaty they are forced to sign or the disturbance within the troop themselves. Every time our main characters have a sense of calm, like having a pleasant chat while on guard duty or stealing chickens from a local farmer, that calm is interrupted by more death and destruction. These lulls in action provide a sense of comfortability for the audience that gets ripped away in a second's notice. This juxtaposition occurs throughout the entire film, and I found in incredibly effective.\n\nThe tension of war is aided with a brilliant score. The subtle piano keys mixed with loud bass crashes create an uneasiness that spells impending doom for our main troop. It was quite excellent.\n\nAs previously stated, the performances here are downright incredible. Felix Kammerer was brilliant in his leading role. His evolution from an absolute wreck of soldier, crying and panicking on the battlefield to grizzled vet who is able to run headfirst into battle without a second notice was fantastic. But he still kept the sweet and genuine attitude throughout, having moments of clarity during the battle where he realizes the brutality of what he and his other soldiers are doing. These complex emotions are carried over to the majority of the cast and was one of my favorite parts about this film.\n\nOverall, All Quiet on the Western Front was a major surprise for me. I am not super experienced nor am interested in many war films, but this may have changed my tune because I genuinely believe it is one of the best movies of the year.\n\nScore: 94%\nVerdict: Excellent",

It was a transitional war that combined new technologies with old fighting styles, that is, just ordering wave after wave of boys \u2014 oftentimes not even men, but boys \u2014 to charge their entrenched enemy and avail themselves to a potpourri of bodily terrors that ranged from bullets, bayonets, grenades, flamethrowers and tank tread. Berger does a spectacular job of showing how the elite class propagandized these boys into willfully joining the insane fight \u2014 hundreds of thousands of lives were lost to gain (and then lose again, and then gain again, and then lose) football fields of desolate territory. If getting your limbs blown off or stuck in a barbed wire fence isn't horrific enough, Berger also showcases the mental toll the shelling took on soldiers \u2014 it's the war that gave us the term \"Shell Shocked,\" after all. Paul (Felix Kammerer) is our vessel into this nightmare and we watch him as he transforms from a youthful, patriotic schoolboy into a gaunt, cold waif. The arc Paul's moment with the French soldier who he stabs, smothers with soil, and then attempts to revive, is a microcosm of the budding humanity attempting to break through in this war. However, men like General Friedrichs (David Striesow), with a stupid fucking Dr. Robotnik mustache, would rather send more boys to their senseless deaths literally 15 minutes before a ceasefire is to take effect in order to end the war on a \"victory\" than just go home to Germany. You'll catch yourself saying \"this isn't fair,\" but just wait until the ending. The movie upsets you for all the right reasons. All Quiet on the Western Front is a must-watch and easily a top-five war movie of all time.",

WW1 was the first modern war really so nobody even imagined it would be so bad. another thing is that, yes it is true that they Germany committed horrible acts and killed innocent people but its not like they were the only people that did that, we didn't ride into battle with our allies and every time someone surrendered we put them in handcuffs or what not, we didn't pity our enemies and have mercy on them when we got into their trenches. we killed them. not every time they surrendered but most of the time someone surrendered they were killed on both sides. and I feel like the media and schools teach us that we were the good guys and didn't do anything bad at all. but that's not true, we were the good guys, but like I said, we weren't doing good things and the same with them. we can't view them like that. now, WW2 is a different story because of the holocaust, but there were still soldiers that didn't want to do what they did or had no idea what was going on, they were just put somewhere and told to defend it probably thinking it was for good, overall it was a great movie (yes I do realize I didn't really talk about it) and tries shows what war is (of course, you can really know what war is unless you've been there, and you can never really show what war is. even real footage doesn't.)",

I do have reservations about the final sequence, though it is very good: it almost seems too dramatic, that is to say not random or industrial enough for the First World War. I really like the casting and the acting. There are so many war films that masquerade as anti-war films, but the \"All Quiet\" family stands out in this respect. Generally speaking, one of the criteria for how I rate movies is whether I look forward to rewatching them. Some films, however, are not made to be rewatched (or tapped for quotations). A great film may not be an enjoyable film. How does one then rate such a film if a \"rating\" is a measure of how much one \"likes\" or \"loves\" a film? Well, \"like\" and \"love\" are two different notions altogether. They may even stand in opposition.",

Neither does the German high command care as they make decisions to push forward, with only the number of dead soldiers gaining in numbers as opposed to the Western front being pushed further into enemy territory.\n\nThe film stands among the best as it glides along several scenes showing soldiers running towards almost certain death, unable to avoid whizzing bullets that could strike you in the head at any moment. When all does go quiet on the front, you feel a clash of two emotions: relief of living another day and fear that the peace of silence could break at any moment. The characters enjoy the small things in life such as raw eggs, worth risking your life for. Enjoy what you can in war and hope to avoid the ultimate quietness on the front, death.

The brutal war scenes apparently made with a high budget, but if historical accuracy is totally lacking the scenes appear only as gratuitous violence.

In WWI frontal attacks typically were lucky if they got past their own barbed wire, and during last days of the war the German army was in no position to make an attack. Another example is the initial recruitment scene that is set for 1917. By that stage the German general population had suffered blockade starvation and were well aware of horrors at the front. The recruitment scene is from the novel where it is set in 1914, and an ignorant screenwriter has changed it to 1917 for the sole purpose of making the play with name tags in the uniforms.

The film, for some reason, needed to have a cartoonish villain that sent thousands to their deaths for no other reason then glory. I am not saying this didn't happen, the final hours of the war were hectic to say the least. But the point of the entire book, and the ending being so poignant was that Paul died on a slightly less turbulent day, where even though hundreds may have died, since it was not thousands it was quiet on the western front. And that is my issue, instead of taking its time, instead of letting the horrors of war speak for themselves, the writers put a great neon sign that says \"war is bad.\"",

The set design, the costumes and the setpieces are all phenomenal. They perfectly portray the horrific, dirty and brutal nature of the war. The actors are all great in their roles as well. Felix Kammerer plays the main character, Paul B\u00e4umer, and he gives a terrific performance in showing Paul's gradual loss of idealism throughout the movie. The cinematography by James Friend is oddly beautiful with some gorgeous wide shots that contrast the closeup shots of the War with its grimness. The music score by Volker Bertelmann is quite odd as well with its sudden thumping horns but they work in elevating the tension by foreboding what's coming.\n\nMy only complaint is that the film is quite predictable. It goes through every trope you would expect from a 'War is bad\" movie and nothing in the plot surprised me whatsoever. It's also a little difficult to care for the characters as we barely spend enough time with them apart from the main character and an older soldier called \"Kat\". \n\nApart from that, it is quite a stellar war movie that still delivers on the cruelty of World War I.",

            "content": "Adapted from Erich Maria Remarque's 1929 novel of the same name, All Quiet on the Western Front is an astonishing anti-war film that establishes the events of World War One from a German's perspective. The story follows German student Paul B\u00e4umer, who goes to war with his friends in hopes of gaining glory and honour when they return home from the Front. After months of propaganda and patriotic speeches, the boys begin the journey to Northern France. The true horrors of trench warfare, however, shatter their romanticised view of the war and leave them traumatised. After an infantry offensive and a major gas attack on their first day, the boys are horrified by what lies ahead. \n\nThe film itself was produced in Germany and the cast is not as recognisable as other war films I had previously watched such as Dunkirk and 1917, especially with those featuring some of my favourite actors such as Andrew Scott and Benedict Cumberbatch, who have become household names for people in the UK. All Quiet on the Western Front, however, blew these two films out of the water. The casting was phenomenal, especially Felix Kammerer, who played the protagonist. His emotional range throughout this film is an absolute whirlwind and is guaranteed to keep you hooked throughout the whole movie. \n\nOne of my favourite scenes is when Kammerer's character Paul takes down a French soldier while retreating to the German trenches. Paul is seen watching him bleed out, but soon regrets what he has done and cannot bare to watch someone die because of him. He becomes hysterical and desperately tries to stop his bleeding to no avail. Upon his death, Paul finds a picture of a woman and a little girl in his pocket, who he soon realises to be the man's wife and child. He becomes inconsolable and lies beside the solider as he sobs with regret, realising that he has torn apart a family. This scene is incredibly powerful and highlights the fragility of life on the battlefield as well as the regrets that many faced by the men of the war. Kammerer's performance truly adds a heart-breaking feel to this scene that wouldn't be the same without him. \n\nIt's also interesting to see Paul's overall character development throughout the film. As someone who never read the original novel, I didn't know what to expect when this film was originally suggested to me. Paul starts as an enthusiastic and honest young teen, who is ready to do anything for his country, but he is left broken by war and completely unrecognisable by the end. This also adds to the tear-jerking ending of this film, which I will not spoil. \n\nHowever, one major part of this film is its shock-factor. The gore and the grittiness of this film is something that cannot be ignored and was truly unexpected in my opinion. In films like Dunkirk and 1917, the gore is not a notable part of their narratives, it mainly focuses on their storyline. However, All Quiet on the Western Front plays mostly off its gore, with some truly horrifying images with are honestly haunting. For example, there is a particular scene that spring to mind where the Germans are under attack from allied forces, who are using tanks. The allies not only unload major artillery on the Germans but also run straight over their trenches. As disgusting as it sounds, you physically see the mangling of people under the tires of tanks, and it is truly horrifying to watch. So much so that when I suggested my friend watch this film, she called me in utter shock at what she had just seen. I would truly say this film is not for people with weak stomachs, but it only adds to the truth of this horrifying war. I do promise that this film is not all gory, some light-hearted scenes fill you with hope, such as the boys robbing a farm or their flirting with passing French female civilians. This film truly encompasses all elements of war. \n\nOverall, this movie is an absolute masterpiece and is undoubtedly one of the grittiest, yet most accurate war films I have ever seen. I adored this film and honestly see no way it could have improved.",

However, I think this movie does an amazing job at showing how this war was only just a \"prelude\" to the second world war. \n.\nFrom what I learned there is still much controversy between historians as to how this colossal war even came to be, but it's pretty much agreed upon that there was a \"readiness\" among the nations for war, for a very long time. However - this readiness is obviously BS, because the simple person does not want to go to war, the simple person wants the simple joys life. It's the over-fed, over-confident, under-competent and always-greedy generation of generals who steer the young generation into war, at first claiming that their lives' shortcomings are the result of another group's doing, and then by promising that an armed negotiation will bring an end to their problems. This movie does a great job at showing how the simple person is but a pawn on the chess board of an elite group of grumpy generals. \n.\nAnother thing this movie does so well is show how the ending of the war really marked the beginning of the spin that Germany went into, that resulted in what we know today - was a rise of a fascist right-wing party that scapegoated minorities and stirred turmoil that was enough to fuel a war endeavor that lasted six years and cost millions of lives. \n.\nIt's kind of scary to think about the cold war and eventually what we're going through today, still being a contingent of those wars, but for that reason exactly I think it's important to see how perception itself can so easily change in the face of war and the survival instincts it brings to the surface, and that in and of itself could serve as an important reminder as to why we should never result to war, as long as we can; how it is absolutely the worst case scenario. \n.\nFour stars altogether, because the dialogue was a little disappointing, but nobody is perfect - and I really recommend watching this movie. Close your eyes and mute the sounds often if you're sensitive to graphic violence, since there is a lot of it.",

Too long at two-and-a half hours, too noisy, and too many graphic scenes of violence. Nothing is left to the imagination.\nErich Maria Remarque is of my favourite authors, and \"All Quiet \u2026.\" written in 1929, is a most excellent descriptive and poetic anti-war book, and it eschews all the graphic violence.\n\nSo I would rather they gave this film a different title, as it has not really drawn its inspiration from Remarque's book. By contrast, the original 1930 film \"All Quiet \u2026.\", by Lewis Milestone, is a much superior film, despite its technical limitations.\nThere is a good film to be made here - but this is not it.\nWe were very disappointed - so not recommended viewing!",

The film also doesn't shy away from the realities of war.

It's also essentially cinematically unadaptable in its original form, because it relies so heavily on introspection and internal monologues. With that in mind, this Edward Berger iteration is about as genuine as you can expect to be made in the medium, reiterating the antiwar message and translating the brutality to the muddy depths of the trenches. There are a few weaknesses, particularly veering away from the immersion of Felix Kammerer's Paul B\u00e4umer to provide context in the negotiating table (it seems like the film wanted to take some cues from Paths of Glory) and staying clear of some of the novel's exceptionally bleak gallows humor. There is a whole host of supporting characters (the high command) that feel almost unnecessary to the story, just given how little insight they provide beyond being generically callous. \n\nWithout the benefit of Paul's jaded and detached observations on the circumstances that led him into an industrialized hell and led millions of soldiers to their exceptionally unpleasant and near-pointless deaths on the back of vague ideals, All Quiet on the Western Front is a straightforward but visually striking antiwar film. It doesn't stick with you in the same way that the novel does, but it's about as well-executed as the text of the novel can be expected to be, with solid production value and performances alike.

This is yet another attempt at putting the audience in the shoes of the soldiers who went through hell during that unfortunate time.\n\nHowever, at some point, somebody needs to put an end to this boring madness. All Quiet on the Western Front is exhaustive to get through. The entirety of the two-and-a-half hours is just bleak. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing new offered here. Naturally, people will eat it up because the cinematography looks cool and the soldiers in the field of war once again talk about their families and wives back home to create some cheap emotional connection with the watcher, but it's all been done before.\n\nThe acting is good, the movie looks good, and the battle scenes are decent, but at what point do people realize that we're just watching the same story over and over? There have been plenty of better iterations of WW. I simply don't care to see people getting crushed by tanks yet again, it doesn't hit me emotionally at all anymore. I've seen enough heads get torn up by bullets in literally hundreds of other war films. Let's move on.",

To remember is more important than ever, because it reminds us of our duty. The duty to keep the peace, which institutions like the EU or UN have created.

Many of the shots of nature were beautiful as well, however this film for sure had an ugly side as it should have. War is hell and this demonstrated it well.",

            "content": "Hier wurde mit sehr hohem Aufwand ein eher fragw\u00fcrdiges Werk abgeliefert. Die Handlung des Romans ist nur ansatzweise wiederzuerkennen. Die Macher wollten ihr eigenes Kunstwerk schaffen und lie\u00dfen dabei das eigentliche Kunstwerk \u2013 also den Roman \u2013 \u00fcber die Klinge springen. Den Film macht vor allem das Bem\u00fchen um das Kriegsgrauen aus. Gut gemeint. Aber das ist bekanntlich das Gegenteil von Kunst. \nAber im Detail: \nHandlung:\nDie Macher f\u00fchlten sich vollkommen frei, ihre eigene Geschichte zu erz\u00e4hlen. Die Vorgeschichte um den \u201eSchleifer\" Himmelsto\u00df f\u00e4llt vollkommen weg. Der Heimatbesuch Paul B\u00e4umers, der die Entfremdung zeigt, fehlt ebenfalls. Die Figuren verlieren dadurch Identit\u00e4t und wirken den ganzen Film \u00fcber wie Statisten, zu denen man keine Beziehung aufbaut. Deren Schicksal nimmt der Zuschauer dadurch erstaunlich gelassen zur Kenntnis. Die Kriegsbegeisterung am Anfang wird nur kurz \u00fcber eine Gebr\u00fcllszene der Protagonisten gezeigt. Insgesamt ist die Handlung des Romans in dem Film nur schwer wiederzuerkennen. Allzu oft greifen die Macher in die Klischeekiste wie zum Beispiel beim fanatischen General, der Menschen trotz Aussichtslosigkeit in den Tod treibt. Die Handlung wurde dem \u201ek\u00fcnstlerischen\" Anspruch der Macher und der Botschaft, so wie sie sie verstanden haben wollten, gnadenlos untergeordnet. Dabei w\u00e4re weniger oft mehr gewesen. Der Tod von Paul B\u00e4umer wirkt in der auf die Spitze getriebenen Sinnlosigkeitsdarstellung nicht tragisch sondern eher albern. Als Kat get\u00f6tet wird, fragt man sich eigentlich nur, welche Botschaft denn nun hier wieder vermittelt werden sollte, dass es n\u00f6tig war, die Handlung auf diese Weise umzugestalten. Die Macher haben nicht verstanden, dass die Tragik der Romanfiguren auch in der Art liegt, wie diese letztlich zu Tode gekommen sind. Ein verirrter Querschl\u00e4ger aus einem Kampfflugzeug und der Schuss eines Scharfsch\u00fctzen verbunden mit der totalen Resignation und fast dem Einverst\u00e4ndnis zu genau dieses Schicksal, macht den Tod im Roman so tragisch. Er wurde zerst\u00f6rt, bevor er get\u00f6tet wurde. Im Film findet man nichts davon. Hier deutet man den Tod um und l\u00e4sst ihn durch einen fanatischen General in der letzten Minute des Kriegs den Tod laufen nachdem man ihn im feindlichen Sch\u00fctzengraben noch flei\u00dfig herumeifern sehen durfte. Albern. \nSchauspieler:\nHier ist das Elend der deutschen Schauspielerei deutlich zu sehen. Sitzen diese zusammen, werden Gesten und Gesichtsausdr\u00fccke durch den aktuellen Satz bestimmt, den sie aufsagen m\u00fcssen, nicht durch den Charakter der Figuren, die sie spielen. Das Spielen wird dadurch zu einem Kaleidoskop der Grimassen, die den verschiedenen S\u00e4tzen folgen wie ein Hund dem Herrchen. Es wird br\u00fcllendes Lachen gespielt, weil irgendwo in der Regieanweisung steht, man sei ausgelassen bis heiter. Der Zuseher fragt sich, ob er grad eine Pointe verpasst hat oder warum die nun alle derartig Lachen wegen eines Satzes, den irgendjemand fallen l\u00e4sst, aber der keinerlei Anlass f\u00fcr einen solchen Heiterkeitsausbruch gibt. Und wenn einer dann einen Satz sp\u00e4ter von etwas d\u00fcsterem erz\u00e4hlt wird, d\u00fcstert sich synchron dazu die Mimik ein. Es entsteht der Eindruck, dass die Schauspieler vor allem ihr schauspielerisches Genie zur Schau stellen m\u00f6chten, statt der Figur, die sie spielen, eine Seele einzuhauchen. So kommt es auch, dass man die Szene, in der P.B\u00e4umer seinen toten Freund im Sch\u00fctzengraben findet und ihn die Kleidung richtet, kaum emotional ber\u00fchrt. \nDramaturgie:\nKurz: Ambitioniert, aber nicht gelungen. Wie schon gesagt, gibt es kaum Szenen, die einen emotional ber\u00fchren. Patzer, wie die skurrilen Panzer auf rel. modernem Fahrwerk, die nicht entfernt \u00c4hnlichkeit mit den englischen \u201eTanks\" dieser Zeit haben, ist eines \u2013 das w\u00fcrde vielleicht den Aufwand sprengen? (kaum verst\u00e4ndlich, wenn man die M\u00f6glichkeiten der Computer-VFX ber\u00fccksichtigt). Dass diese aber agieren wie aus einem Film aus dem 2. WK verzeiht man schon weniger. Der Angriff im Verbund mit Infanterieunterst\u00fctzung ist ein Konzept, das nicht in den 1. WK passt. Dort blieb die Panzerwaffe erstaunlich wirkungslos, eben WEIL man sie noch nicht in der o.a. Art und Weise einzusetzen wusste. \nDie Darstellung der Infanterieangriffe wirken im Film nicht besonders gelungen. Die strategische Trag\u00f6die des Grabenkriegs im WK I war das st\u00e4ndige Anst\u00fcrmen im Rudel gegen ein Maschinengewehr nach Artillerievorbereitung. Im Film verzichtet man auf die Darstellung dieser d\u00fcmmsten und sinnlosesten Art, einen Infanterieangriff zu f\u00fchren. Man verzichtet auf die Darstellung des Grauens im Sch\u00fctzengraben, bevor der Pfiff aus der Signalpfeife einen in den sicheren Tod treibt. Man sieht Angriffe, kann aber den Ablauf nicht nachvollziehen, der diese Art der Kriegsf\u00fchrung so besonders menschenverachtend macht. Eine verpasste Chance, gerade wo der Schwerpunkt des Films auf Kriegsgr\u00e4uel liegt. Man hat den Eindruck, die Macher haben gar nicht verstanden, wovon sie eigentlich berichten. F\u00fcr sie besteht das Grauen des Kriegs vor allem in den dreckigen Gesichtern. Er ist dreckig, ergo leidet er. \nDa oder dort findet aber ein gelungenes Kontrastspiel zwischen Dreck/Kalt/Blut/Tod (Sch\u00fctzengr\u00e4ben) und W\u00e4rme/Ordnung/Wohlstand (Generalsquartier oder Verhandlungskom.) statt. Das ist aber das einzig da oder dort gelungene Dramaturgieelement. \nFazit:\nWenn man sich derartig respektlos mit einem soliden Nichtwissen \u00fcber den Roman oder die Verh\u00e4ltnisse im WK I an dieses Thema so heranmacht, wie die Macher dieses Films, verdient man keine Anerkennung. Vielleicht k\u00fcrzt man das Fazit zu 3 Bereichen zusammen: \nThema verfehlt, Thema nicht verstanden, das was man am Thema glaubt verstanden zu haben wurde schlecht umgesetzt. \nAufw\u00e4ndig produziert und mit unn\u00f6tigen L\u00e4ngen, trotz dieses Stoffs.",

My great uncle Willi rose to the rank of Feldwebel-Lieutenant in that war, fighting for the Kaiser and must have had very similar experiences to these. His company relieved the troops that seized the enemy trenches in the Great Gas Attack of April 1915 in Ypres, but he was seriously wounded in the furious enemy counterattack and assuming his wounds were fatal, went berserk, charging alone into no man's land where his body was never recovered. His company then had to retreat under intense fire from their position, their temporary gains and heroism amounting to nothing in the long run, much like the battles in the movie. That was the futility of the Great War where all sides became losers. Watch this movie!",

Sadly, this is the only thing this film achieves. From a complete failure to follow the source material to a montage of historical inaccuracies this film, in my opinion, disrespects what Erich Maria Remarque set out to convey in his novel and what the 1979 version does so well. It was their intention to make the film as random as possible to portray the randomness of war. I understand what they were going for but it doesn't allow the viewers to build a relationship with the characters and therefore, the emotional effect of seeing Paul's friends being lost is not as impactful as the 1979 film, which does build that relationship. The choice to have Paul join in 1917 and then skip straight to November 1918 loses the opportunity of seeing the transition of Paul from a young adult who still has a sense of innocence to being transformed into a haunted soul who has seen years of war. At the end of the day, if you want a mindless portrayal of the senseless shock of war this film fulfills that, if you want a film that truly shows the effect of war on man and the loss of innocence, watch the 1979 adaptation.",

It felt very real and gritty with the amazing cinematography, realistic sets and landscapes, and spot-on visual effects, prosthetics and carnage.\n\nThe big problem that I had with this film is co-writer and director Edward Berger's overzealous constant display of useless, and dragged out shots. The entire film is stuffed with style over substance, with many useless scenes that needed to end up on the cutting room floor. It's like this film wasn't even edited/cut down. An example is the French leader asking if the croissant was made today; who cares. It's ok to throw in the odd metaphor here and there, but there were far too many, in addition to the constant shots of an empty forest, the sky, etc, that added nothing to the film except annoyance. Sure there were undeniably powerful moments, but they were overshadowed by all over-stylization and lesser involving narrative that we've all seen in more inspiring war films. All three writers seemed to enjoy long sequences where very little of interest happens, and the little interest there is, is milked to the maximum time.\n\nIf this was cut down to about a 90 min runtime, the tension and suspense would be more appreciated and the narrative more engaging. And that's a shame, because this was so beautifully and realistically shot, with outstanding casting and performances, but had the writing and directing been better, this film would've been great, instead of just good. The score was very fitting - with the exception of the random outbursts of ear-pounding loud sound effects. It's a decent one-time watch if you have 148 mins to invest with nothing better to watch - even if just to appreciate the scope of the production values and excellent performances.",

With the budget they had for this film I was awestruck that the CGI lazily pasted blood spatter on the actors who were getting shot. There was no sense to incorporate realism which even films like Stalingrad, Saving Private Ryan, and mini series shows like Band of Brothers and The Pacific do extremely well. What sets apart our war films from the past to today, was not just the story telling, but the ability to visually compel the audience about the horrors of war. For an anti-war statement that the original author sought to convey in his book, this movie does not do it justice. Cinematography and creative direction aside, the actors are amazing and it's worth the watch if you can turn a blind eye to the lack of investment towards the details.",

We are following the same characters in the same place and time but the dynamics is bit different. \n2. We can dismiss the book and look at it purely as an war movie. From this perspective I must admit it's absolutely brilliant and might be one of the best WW1 depictions in movie format. I am not that big of an expert on WW1 but I think the movie depicted the conflict accurately and sensitively. The pacing of the story is great and you will get overall feel of the horrors, despair and pointlessness of the conflict.\n3. We can also dismiss the historical accuracy of the movie and look at it just purely from technical/cinematographical point of view. From this perspective I also have to give the movie very high marks. The movie is \"beautiful\", camera and production design are top notch. Acting is great, sound effects and visual effects very well done. Music is quite forgettable but I dig it, you are not expecting \"big hits\" to take away from the very gritty story so that is actually working well with the rest. Story is presented in very captivating way and here I have to say that I think that the changes they made to it from the original book are actually working well for the movie experience. I have no problem if producers don't follow the book word by word in order to deliver overall feel and in this case it worked extremely well. I had the same feel from it as I remember from the book despite the changes. And that is something I appreciate a lot.\nOverall, I can strongly recommend this movie.",

The helmets, weaponry, formations, the negotiation scene in the 3rd act, etc. \n\nI noticed two main defining things about this movie that made it stand out; The tone/lamp-shading and the usage of dialogue. \n\nThe first point: the tone. It is noticeable once the soldiers get fired on during a March to the front lines, fresh from enlistment.  It switches from a (relatively) lighthearted stay to a cold front. It's not about the transition, but the smoothness and of how well it was incorporated. This is seen throughout the rest of the film.\n\nThe second point: the dialogue. I noticed how there is never filler dialogue. The dialogue is always used sparingly, and when it is the dialogue always has a purpose. Either setting up the tone, character backgrounds, current thoughts from our protagonists, etc. A deeper dive on this could be made, but I'm not a professional, so I will leave that to them. \n\nOverall a wonderful film from a wonderful cast, and film production crew.",

By leaving out the personal, the teenage soldier Paul truly becomes \"EVERYMAN\"  not allowing the viewer to sympathize with him based on some special characteristics as a son, student, intelligent sensitive individual... -Instead the movie generates empathy with the millions of soldiering souls who died in that war, physically or mentally.

There is no glory, no pride, and no patriotism, just shame, devastation, comradery, and survival. History tells us that 3 millions of soldiers died in the absurdist trenches war on the Western Front, and it was over a few hundred of meters of lands that has been gained and lost back and again in 4 years of war. Millions of young soldiers had to kill one another in a stalemate that benefited no one. In one devastating scence (perhaps the best scene in the film) we see our protagonist Paul viciously stabbing a French soldier that was trying to kill him, and when the Frenchman was gasping for air next to him, we see Paul huudles next him crying and apologizing while watching him dying. Paul has been at it for almost 2 years and watched all his friends dying one by one while he is helplessly fighting a hopeless war wanting it to be over one way or another. Even the lighthearted scenes between battles had them putting themselves in harm's way trying to steel food from a farmer who kept trying to shoot them.\n\nWe see in the waning hours of war when everyone knew it's over and the Germans would have to declare their defeat, the remaining soldiers stared celebrating there emenanat return home, only for one war-mongering general in the name of false pride decided to throw them back in the mouth of madness and for absolutely no gain. I'd say every war has to put its generals in the front lines and let them have a taste of their own medicine, along side the politicians and war profiteers. Let's try this and may be then we will stop killing one another in pointless wars.",

This wasn't even in the film and it's arguably the most important part! \n\nNeither was Paul's stay at the field hospital, which was a good glimpse into how wounds alter soldiers' lives. The dead are often remembered (Memorial Day and the like) but soldiers with life-changing wounds rarely are, and it was disappointing to see the film neglect that portion of the novel as well.\n\nThere was a bit too much deviation from the novel for my liking. Kat dying from a farmer's son shooting him after stealing a goose took from the impact of his death. The buzzer-beating assault was pretty bad, too. Why didn't Paul just hide in a bomb crater until the armistice or shoot the firing squad? I'm sure he'd have no shortage of help from the other soldiers because they knew the war was over and I'm sure just wanted to go home alive.\n\nThe film was OK, but I definitely won't watch it again.

Paul, in the novel, has a dramatic outcry to the insanity and horror of it all. It is NOT glorious, It is carnage and senseless. That part of his character is sadly missed in the film.

This version doesn't dial back the brutality in any way, though I think the 1930 original is MUCH more brutal and graphic (even in black and white), and this color version is rated R for a reason. It's not quite as graphic as \"Saving Private Ryan\" in my opinion, but it is still pretty damn harsh and sometimes hard to watch, as it should be.\nThis new version (which I encourage you to watch in the original German with subtitles, though there is an English version) struck me as different right off the bat. It starts later in the war, 11 days from the Armistice instead of near the beginning of hostilities. It otherwise follows the established story of the novel pretty closely, though it actually includes a parallel story that counts down over that last week showing how Germany sued for an Armistice because of the horrible loss of life, and the French and Allies pretty much refused to grant it until they could dictate horrible terms that crushed the Germans and lit the flames that caused World War II 20 years later. The movie's ending is notably changed a bit (but still the same outcome) from the novel and the prior films, but that makes it even more painful to watch. It is, after all, an anti-war film and story from 1929 that hits the viewer hard and can be depressing, as in all the prior productions. \nI recommend it because it presents a tragic message that never changes; no matter how horrible the results of war are, no matter how much pain and tragedy is wrought upon civilians and soldiers alike, no matter how much needless death choreographed by fervent military leaders and government there is, nobody ever learns the lesson and history is condemned to repeat itself.",

For two and a half hours my eyes were fixed on the screen looking at the horror that was the western front during world war 1. There is no real story, rather just following a few select characters and experiencing the war. The production quality here is nothing short of brilliant. There is not one moment that I ever thought I was anywhere other than the trenches. The lighting, sound design, and cinematography are meticulous and all go towards immersion. The cast here is superb, actors do the most they can with very little screen time conveying the horror just before they pass. Felix Kammerer does a phenomenal job, you are right with him for the entire journey and his performance allows you to feel exactly what he feels in each moment. The action here is shot well, both lending to wide immersive shots of violence, then transitioning into close quarters combat within the trench itself. With all manner of artillery, machine gun fire, flamethrowers, and tanks.  However even with all the action, it never is glorified, never seems overstated. The director fundamentally understands that the true horror of war, there are no heroes. Men who once killed another man begging for his life soon find themselves at the opposite side of that equation. And more often than not ones survival can boil down to luck. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys war film, and one of the best in its genre.",

So interesting to see it from the German's side rather than Western heroism and how they went from brainwashed to battle worn which can happen with any nation. Oh hey and at least there wasn't any check boxes with this modern adaptation! Just a good story and great acting. A little long but it kept you captivated.",

I also noticed it combines elements from various directors that I personally love (Kubrick, Spielberg, Tarkovsky, Kurosawa). Especially the calm scenes between battles showing the harrowing beautiful  winter landscapes or a floating bottle within a bathtub in the foreground and messy building structures in the background; that is so Tarkovsky especially when every scene \"breaths\" and  holds for lengths. \nExceptional filmmaking. Unfortunately is not a film you see on repeat, not only is violent but hell depressing and bleak till the very end.",

Dealing with the physical, emotional, and psychological effects of war, the friends soon just try to survive to make it home alive. This rendition is completely in French and German which I appreciated (in fact, I believe it's submitted from Germany for consideration in the Best Foreign Film at next year's Oscars). Beautiful cinematography and sets, the story wastes little time in putting our 4 young lads right in the thick of it. With a runtime approaching 2 hours and 30 minutes, it can drag at times.

Especially the end of the movie with the charge before 11am and Paul and Kat dying the way they did. Would've rather it just have stuck to the original story. In terms of the anti-war sentiment the original does a much better job. This one got a bit unrealistic with the ending. The original story ends before the armistice while this one ends at the time of the armistice. I guess the whole theme is death in a pointless war but the way Paul and Kat die is just slightly unrealistic in this version. I don't know. Maybe it was to prove a point about how pointless the death was but a charge at 10:45 on armistice day by a hardline general just seems completely unrealistic whereas one of the reasons why the original is so good is because it's extremely realistic",
