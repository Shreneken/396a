    "summary": "Will Hunting (Matt Damon) has a genius-level IQ but chooses to work as a janitor at MIT. When he solves a difficult graduate-level math problem, his talents are discovered by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), who decides to help the misguided youth reach his potential.

He was a foster child that went through many abusive foster families before living on his own. This has left many scars not only on his body but also in his heart. This prevents him from moving forward through life and fulfilling his potential. This would all change after one fateful encounter...\n\nI absolutely loved this movie. The characters are super intricate and intriguing. The pacing is very solid; there are always moving parts in play that keep your attention close to the story. Camerawork was nothing to write home about but not the worst either. The music in this movie was absolutely perfect, loved it very much. In general this movie is one of my favorites of all time. So with a little bias sprinkled on top I will give this movie a perfect score.\n\n10/10",

            "content": "\"Good Will Hunting\" (1997) is a drama/romance film that explores the life and struggles of Will Hunting (played by Matt Damon), a young man from a working-class background who has a prodigious talent for mathematics. Directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Damon and Ben Affleck, the film follows Will as he navigates his relationships with his friends, his love interest (played by Minnie Driver), and a therapist (played by Robin Williams) who helps him to confront his personal demons.\n\nThe film's strongest aspect is its writing, with Damon and Affleck delivering a powerful and emotional script that explores themes of identity, relationships, and personal growth. The film's characters are well-written and well-acted, with Damon delivering a standout performance as Will Hunting. Williams also delivers an excellent performance as Will's therapist, earning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe film's cinematography is solid and effective, capturing the gritty and realist aesthetic of the film's working-class setting. The film's music, composed by Danny Elfman, is subtle and effective, enhancing the film's emotional moments without overwhelming them. The film's direction by Van Sant is confident and assured, delivering a visual style that is both effective and understated.\n\nHowever, some may argue that the film's pace is slow at times, lacking the dramatic momentum of other dramas. Additionally, some may find the film's resolution to be too neat and tidy, failing to fully explore the complexities of Will's personal struggles.\n\nOverall, \"Good Will Hunting\" is a well-made and emotionally powerful drama/romance film that explores themes of identity, relationships, and personal growth with intelligence and empathy. With strong writing, excellent performances, and confident direction, \"Good Will Hunting\" is a movie that will appeal to fans of drama, romance, and thought-provoking filmmaking.",

The film stars Matt as Will Hunting, a young man from South Boston with a troubled past who works as a janitor at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). \n\nDespite lacking former education, Will is able to solve a mathematics problem which was supposed to be very advanced for the actual students, revealing that the protagonist actually has an overwhelming talent for mathematics. When a renowned mathematician (played by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) discovers Will's abilities, he sets out to help him reach his full potential. The story goes on when, due to unforeseen circumstances, Will has to attend a psychologist called Sean (Robin Williams), and also finds the person who could be the love of his life.\n\nThis film enters typical topics such as love and friendship, but also enters in the world of denial and struggle to find one's place in the world. The performance by all the main actors (Damon, Affleck and Williams) are outstanding, and the film's script is moving and insightful. Even if Good Will Hunting is a movie over 20 years old, it still remains an emotional and impactful movie.",

If it truly followed through as a feel-good winner story that had us rooting for the main character then I would have enjoyed the ride however this film plays on uncomfortable moments to create tension which in my opinion stands in the way of making this enjoyable viewing. The whole relationship angle that our genius becomes involved in is an aside as is the strangled attempts to clean him up via therapy. We get a lot of impressions within the movie but nothing really sticks. As usual, Willams overshadows the entire cast but even then I feel he is acting alone in a movie that is indifferent to talent and simply tells the story of a clever guy who has been overlooked. And to be honest that is a story that does not really need to be told. What a bore.",

Wouldn't look at a guy like me and think much of anything besides \"I might take him back to my house for the night. MIGHT.\" Wouldn't think I tested college level for my writing ability in the third grade, or that I know more about stock options than I do shapes. But therein lays the beauty of the chord that this film plucks on time and time again. I can't watch this film without being on the verge of tears because Will Hunting is painfully real. All the kid ever wanted was to feel like he belonged. Like someone cared. And no one ever did until he met Skylar. That's where this film gets it right. Nothing will ever change a man's life more than the loving touch of a woman. I only wish I didn't push the Skylar I knew away. Because I know she's not coming back. He didn't have that burden.",

Good Will Hunting is an incredible movie and if I had to say what I think is Gus Van Sant's best film, this would be it. It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film's poignancy and psychological aspect.\n\nGood Will Hunting is a beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery, and it is directed wonderfully by Van Sant. The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.\n\nThe acting is one of the film's best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best \"drama\" roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.\n\nAll in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

He has a poor background and emotional problems from a bad childhood, plus a girl interested in him, yet instead of breaking out of his miserable existence he initially wants to stay in it...but is convinced to change his mind.\n\nSo what went wrong? A genius might have a rough existence, but he acts like everybody else around him except for his magically solving complicated mathematical problems. Um, anyone who's so much smarter than his peers would show signs of it that nobody could ignore, such as being able to say and do things most others wouldn't think of. Why couldn't he have become, say, a professional gambler (degree not required)? Why would he cause trouble and not be able to charm his way out of it.

About a man sitting on a goldmine but he's to scared to reach out and cash it in. The back and forth between Will and Sean, the confrontations with Skyler and Lambeau, the casual heart to heart of two buddies taking a break at work. The satisfying moments of Will's intellectual triumph's revealed to mean nothing to him, boring to him. All of this real, human drama asks the question of what potential is, what purpose is. Unlike so many films that use ambiguity as a pedestal for creating more evocative work, Good Will Hunting gives a quiet, thoughtful answer to the question it asks and says if you want to reach your potential you have to get off your butt and do something, get out of your comfort zone. Will's intellectual capabilities were only part of the picture and from a storytelling perspective, just a larger than life ingredient to drive home the message of the question \"what do you want to do?\" I think when Sean asks that question is when Will's world suddenly falls. Suddenly it's not about living up to other peoples expectations, it's about living up to your own, about having the drive to do something more. With Skyler to get him thinking, Sean to get him talking and the last push from Chuckie to get him moving, Will is faced with his whole life and finally knows what he'll do with it. That's a powerful message and one made ever so poignant by the eloquence of the dialogue (punctuated... ahem, ever so delicately by the... ahem, colorful language) that often plays out like a battle of wits that's a pleasure to witness, the strength, the depth of emotion, the genuine feeling of each performance (especially from the great Robin Williams), the slices of goofing around, telling stories, talking about nothing gives out a feel good spirit to a movie with a message that should be hard to swallow. Not only is that good stuff, that's important stuff, especially for me, That's almost definitely the reason I'm giving this movie such a high rating. The core of it connected with me in a very special way but it's not bias, it's just what art does to you.",

My only glaring issue with the movie is how cruel and borderline abusive Matt Damon's character gets towards his girlfriend towards the end of the movie and just how nonchalantly glossed over it was by the movie and the other characters. They treated it more like a disappointing break-up than a yellow flag of the possibility of continuing the cycle of abuse onto his loved ones. Which is a damn shame since it could've been a really powerful moment that would've shed some nuance on the dangers of lashing out at your loved ones as a means of coping with your own trauma and how we can choose the higher path. It could've done a better job at highlighting the consequences of lashing out and the path to personal redemption. I'll also admit that the protagonist is a bit grating early on as the unrealistically brilliant and douchey jerk-sue character, a common power fantasy enjoyed by male screenwriters and moviegoers alike.

The story itself had an obvious destination, but the same can be said of most movies, and it's less plot-driven than most so it's hardly a criticism. The characters were well-designed and the scenes with his therapist were effective at eliciting emotion. I wasn't fully on board with the initial fighting scenes as the fact they were written by testosterone-filled 20-somethings shone through in them but they otherwise did an impeccable job. The acting was obviously top-notch and the really seemed to make their $10M budget stretch with well-designed sets.",

The soul of this movie is undoubtedly Robin Williams and his powerful ability to portrait genuine compassion woven with pain and hurt. Matt Damon is also no slouch in that department. That sentiment and barriers we all face accessing that virtue is the core of this movie. The narrative is pretty standard: someone greater than their class and start held back by the legacy of that life trying to find a way out. All the usual stages of psychological development play out: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and eventual acceptance of life's trauma. The formula isn't this story's big hook. It is how the characters manage to feel so real. \n\nEveryone in this movie shows moments of honesty, failure and humanity. They all do it in ways that remain true to the characters they're cast as. This is not all moments of feel good triumph or acceptance, but people growing struggling and advancing with the materials put in front of them. I cannot think of a more satisfying way to tell this type of story. \n\nGood Will Hunting is an excellent movie that falls short of the upper crust because it was maybe not daring enough. When you re-watch the movie, at least for me, I am struck how I stopped focusing on the narrative at all and really focused on the scenes, the bottled moments and witty dialogue. That is the magic in this movie and for that, it is a real masterwork",

In Harvard, Matt Damon was assigned to write a final act for his film class, but ended up writting a 40 page script, originating Good Will Hunting. Gus Van Sant took on the directors chair, having a reputation of creating just average movies. Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon & Ben Affleck worked tirelessly together, to put on such an inspiring movie.\n\nThis story may have came off a tad predictable throughout, but the narrative packed deep messages, involving all the characters as much as possible. With all the messages of friendship, acceptance, and self realization, Vant Sant, Damon & Affleck kept this lazer-focused structure, paying close attention to detail.\n\nThe screenplay by Ben Afleck & Matt Damon was written & portrayed at such a prestigious level, being so memorable! My one question is, HOW DID THIS NOT GET THE COMEDY GENRE TITLE?! I found this movie absolutely hilarious through the first two acts! The jokes hit every single time, due to the terrific chemistry the whole cast has. With the absolute brilliant script, Matt Damon & Ben Affleck were awarded by the Academy Awards for Best Original Script.\n\nBilly Hopkins, Kerry Barden & Suzanne Smith casted such a brilliantly talented cast, that had effortless chemistry. Matt Damon put on, in my opinion, his best performance, and I'm still very upset he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor. His performance was super intelligent, while also having so many different enjoyable character traits. Right off the bat, you really felt for his character. His backstory is what holds him back in life, playing himself as his own antagonist, so it was a breeze to indulge into his character, despite his unorthodox personality. Ben Affleck put on such an authentic performance. The connection Affleck & Damon have off the screen really shows on set, being cut from the same cloth, along with Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser & John Mighton. Right along with Matt Damon, I'd personally say that this is my favorite Robin Williams performance. You can sense his wit & mature mindset the minute he steps foot on set. The bond he creates with Matt Damon is nothing short of inspiring, while having one of the best scenes in cinema history. His performance felt so genuine & connective, it won him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Minnie Driver was a constant presence throughout the film, aiding Damon's character development. She was also another character you can truly feel for. Her expressions and feelings were sold great, feeling like Damon & Driver have done more than one movie together. Stellan Skarsgard was a big part of how everything moved. He also had a great connection with Robin Williams, having one specific scene feeling so real! The Boston accents everyone had were actually awesome! Everyone who had the accent, felt so authentic, flowing great with the theme and setting.\n\nOverall, after only seeing this movie once, it ranks up in my personal favorite top ten list.",

Cinematography, characterization, and Williams really bring out the story and characters in a believable way, with some excellent scenes that are very memorable. This is one of my favorite movies, but just the illogical attitude of this genius is hard to get over. You will be sitting there thinking \"dang, if I was this good at math, I would use it and become a millionaire and as famous as Einstein!\", which he Could as made apparent. So Why Is He Such A Little Kid About It! It makes no sense. There is a difference between being bad and getting mad-rich, and being Extremely Specialized and getting mad-rich. If you know you can sell bricks and make mad money, you might decide Not to because you Know it is bad. You might know killing for money is bad so you don't do these things because they are bad. But, when you have a profound Talent that is Highly sought-after, and are Brilliant, then Not using the skill is just Stupid. Other than this nagging thing which prevents it from 5/5 and 10/10, everything else is of the Highest-quality.",

            "content": "A thoughtful film about empathy.\n\nGus Van Zant's indie coming of age drama Good Will Hunting (1997) is phenomenal. It's still as affecting now that I'm grown up as when I was an impressionable kid watching this film. Gus van Zant's direction is intimate and heartfelt as he casually captures genuine moments of friendship, romance, and therapy with a gentle eye for serene mid shots. His use of close-ups is particularly riveting and emotional in Good Will Hunting. Van Zant's indie sensibilities ensure his artistic vision is realized in a sincere way full of fragile sentimental characters that reflect regular guys. You can tell Van Zant is an indie auteur as he even has underground director Harmony Korine cameo as a crazy criminal named Jerve.\n\nMatt Damon is astounding as the complex teenage savant Will Hunting. He explodes with visceral rage, defensive angst, endearing romance, cruel lies, endless deceit, broken tears, and peerless academic knowledge. Damon convinces you his character Will is both troubled and genius. He feels effortless in the role, but you can tell Damon poured his heart and soul into this magnificent character acting. I would even say Will Hunting is his best character up there with Jason Bourne. Damon is not always a subtle actor, but his expressive acting is full of energy and passion.\n\nRobin Williams is sublime as Sean Maguire. His bearded, patient, and sensitive therapist professor is such a wonderful display of Williams' dramatic prowess as an actor. He demonstrates how deep he can make a man with his nuanced and devastating dramatic character acting. Williams uses his immense heart to make Maguire inspiring, relatable, and real. He delivers several incredible speeches and lines that stay with you forever after seeing Good Will Hunting.\n\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd is excellent as the driven, genius mathematics professor Gerald Lambeau pushing Damon towards a theoretical mathematics profession. Ben Affleck makes a turn as a nice loyal friend to Damon named Chuckie Sullivan. His earnest admission about his desire for Will's future at the construction site is so powerful and real, especially with the payoff at Will's house at the end. Good Will Hunting is some of Ben Affleck's finest dramatic acting. Casey Affleck is hilarious as the Boston lowlife Morgan O'Mally. His casual remarks come across as really sincere, so he's an endearing idiot. I love his one liner after Damon stands up for Ben Affleck against a pseudo-intellectual college student. Minnie Driver is profoundly moving as Damon's girlfriend Skylar. Her tears in her dorm room feel so authentic to her character's heartbreak.\n\nGood Will Hunting is simply a life changing, life affirming, and inspiring film that holds up beautifully. Van Zant desperately searches for human decency and kindness in his seminal drama. You will find purpose in life after watching this moving drama that is so very down to Earth. Good Will Hunting is one of those rare films that everyone I know loves dearly.\n\nMatt Damon and Ben Affleck's script is raw, real, and thoughtful as these two teenage actors wrote an original screenplay with a Boston realism and a sympathetic viewpoint. They take on child abuse, career potential, lifelong friendship, new romance, spousal grief, patient therapy, and emotional honesty in this mature script full of heart. How can you not be impressed by the monologues and little details in Good Will Hunting?\n\nPietro Scalia's editing is very slick as he cuts from quiet scenes of reflection to noisy conversations that friends have to randomly goof around. Scalia's editing choices make Good Will Hunting's 127 minutes to fly by like a quick afternoon. Jean-Yves Escoffier's cinematography delivers soft close-ups indoors during therapy sessions that hit hard, while outdoors there are such warm tones and cute framing. His shots are now classic and remain timeless by their own virtues. He captures real feeling with his emotionally gripping shot choices. I love the medium shots of Casey Affleck or Matt Damon looking out a window while Ben Affleck drives them around Boston.\n\nDanny Elfman's sweet score is a symphony to sympathy. His caring melodies cradle the painful moments of touching drama within Good Will Hunting like a warm blanket. Beatrix Aruna Pasztor's costumes look well worn and realistic to the era and location. I love her cardigan sweaters for Robin Williams or her scarf choice for Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd. Missy Stewart and James McAteer's production design displays impoverished Boston homes that look like lived in shacks, while coming up with sleek and authentic feeling offices for the two university professors' offices.\n\nIn all, Gus Van Zant directed an iconic film for all audiences that teenagers and adults alike can enjoy.",

There's a snapshot moment in Mrs. Doubtfire of all movies where he shows his disappointment and pain. It's so deep and seems almost simultaneously despondent and yet irritable and creative pain.

            "content": "If there is any film that you can call \"perfect\" it's this one.\n\n\"That boy is wicked smaht.\"\n\nSYNOPSIS:\nWill Hunting (Matt Damon) seems to have everything you'd want from unparalleled intelligence to incredibly loyal friends to the most loving girlfriend, but even with all of this Will still keeps a wall between him and everything he cares about. A life that would appear to be so simple, is in fact a lot more complex than it seems.\n\nDIRECTION:\nGus Van Sant directs this thing to near perfection. Through his direction there is so much life and grounding added to a story that otherwise seems quite plain. Knowing at which points to change the focus of the camera from one character to the next. Knowing when to hold a close up to really cease a beautiful scene and capture the expression. Now, I'm not going to sit here and act like no one else could've directed this film, however, a film like this could've easily been ruined by poor directing and editing. Great work.\n\nWRITING:\nMatt Damon and Ben Affleck really knocked this one out of the park. Not only was both of their acting on-point, but the dialogue in the film is so pure. There are so many memorable moments in this film just from incredible dialogue. It feels as if there's not a single line in this film that goes unnoticed or should be cut. If the heart could write a script I'm pretty sure this screenplay is what would be the result. This film definitely deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar that it won.\n\nACTING:\nIt's not your fault. It's not your fault. I swear Robin Williams had me screaming \"I KNOW, SEAN!\" followed by aggressive tears from the guilt I felt that I never actually had a reason to feel, but damn you Robin Williams. On top of that, Matt Damon, how dare you memorize ridiculously intellectual monologues like the one at the Harvard Bar scene and the one that cut from you being at a job interview with the CIA or whoever to you being seated in Sean's office. I'm starting to feel this is an autobiography. Are those just books? I don't know. Shut up. Then moving on the Ben Affleck who is my dream best friend. One I can confide in and a man who will willingly go to my job interviews in an over-dramatic BAHSTON accent acting as a pretentious douche. Yes, please! Minnie Driver. That heartbreaking scene over the phone... \"I love you.\" Say it back... SAY IT BACK, WILL! What a killer Irish accent by the way. Not an Irish bone in my body, but trust me... killed that accent. Stellan Skarsgard, I understand how much you care for him Stellan, but he doesn't want to be a damn mathematician. Do you know how easy it is for him?! DO YOU? And Casey Affleck, stop worrying about your damn double burger. I do have to acknowledge how resourceful you were with that baseball glove though. *Tips the hat* \nI realize I just pretty much reiterated lines from the film, but the acting is so damn good that I don't even know what else to say. It's so amazing. I will say this film does possibly have the worst performance of anyone ever, however. Professor Lambeau's assistant. He looked and sounded like he was continuously trying to put himself asleep during every scene he's in.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThis is my favorite film of all time. Though the directing is anything to go crazy about, the writing and the acting in this film, elevates this film to an entire different dimension for me. I can watch this film on repeat 24 hours a day. Actually, make that like 16. Sleep is essential to get another productive 16 hours of Good Will Hunting. That's my review.",

Robin Williams\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM) roll in this movie just makes you love him even more. RIP Robin. Wow who knew Robin Williams and Matt Damon would be some of the best acting ever. Amazing chemistry between the two. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s crazy how smart and bright Damon\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s character is. He just needs an attitude adjustment and to come to terms with all the shit that\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s happened to him in life that got him to where he is now. \n\nThe whole saying, the funniest happiest people are actually the saddest inside, is so true. I think Robin Williams could relate to that. Wow, that scene at the park with Williams and Damon was super impactful. I don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t think they could\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)ve casted a more better person than Robin to play his part. \n\nI think it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s amazing how Will came into all of these different people\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s lives and just completely changed them around. You really get to see how everyone is either benefitting or not benefitting from Will being a part of their lives. He had a purpose all along, part from being brilliant. \n\nI\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)ve been in Will\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s shoes for most of my life. Feeling like I don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t really know what it is I want to do, waisting years on jobs that have no meaning to me. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s really beautiful seeing how Will and Sean\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s relationship blossoms almost like a father son thing. \n\nI\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)m glad Will found enlightenment and hope with the help of Sean and finally went after what he really wanted in the end. Beautiful and very inspiring movie. It just goes to show that even the poorest and most misfortuned people in the world can possess talents, skills, and intelligence that more fortunate people can have or might have. What it really comes down to is, are you going to do something about it. Are you going to go after what you really want in this life?",

This vivacious film runs on nothing but the merit of the script. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the writers, aren't bringing anything new on the table, but it is the Disney of the dramatic movies. Incredibly confident in its ingredients, the film never stutters, not even for a frame. What's been so crowd pleasing about the script, is its ability to create a topsy-turvy world in a pragmatic one. Usually, the concept of \"power\" in the hand is often presented as misused by the characters and also always is craved by them.\n\nIn here, Matt Damon who powerfully portrays a guy that accounts in, his photographic memory as a hindrance. His surrounding doesn't ask him to repel it, but his affection towards that very surrounding and the fear to go physically distant with it, makes him turn all this into a hobby. Damon's excruciating performance of an arrogant and blessed kid has a match that makes him rubble in a snap.\n\nAnd the answer is Robin Williams, that cloaks in a completely opposite persona to Damon in order to get in, in his game. If Damon likes to hurt, he keeps his wound open, if Damon oozes power and rage, he whispers warmth so gently that it makes your eyes teary within a blink. And despite of all the other tracks sprinkled amazingly in the film, Williams and Damon sharing a few laughs sitting in the room is the best asset of it, that Gus Van Sant is well aware of and encourages it like some big antic to stand tall and proud upon. Good Will Hunting is never a hunt, if anything it is the surrender in a long lasting lost game, that actually our host never cares for.",

When Van Sant came on board, Robin Williams (already a superstar) signed up.  I skipped this in the 1990s but I thought I would fill in this gap now.  Damon plays a kid from Boston who has genius-level math ability but is self-taught and full of anger and defensiveness.  When he is discovered/rescued by a math professor (Stellan Skarsg\u00c3\u00a5rd), the deal is that he can stay out of jail only if he attends both math workshops and therapy.  No therapist can handle his challenges until Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), also from working class South Boston and the professor\u00e2(TM)s former college roommate, is brought in.  At the same time, Will Hunting (Damon) continues to hang out with his school mates, the two Afflecks included, and while at a bar, he meets Skylar (Minnie Driver, in a charismatic performance) and they start a romance.  Will\u00e2(TM)s avoidant attachment style (developed through harsh treatment at the orphanage where he grew up) nearly causes him to throw away his career in maths and his new romance with Skylar.  Of course, with the loving mentoring of Williams (underplaying dramatically), he breaks through the wall. In a movie like this, it isn\u00e2(TM)t a spoiler, is it?  This is all about the final \u00e2feel good\u00e2? moment \u00e2\" which also reduces the film\u00e2(TM)s artistic merits (i.e., its been given the Hollywood treatment which you can see coming from a mile away).  The psychologizing is probably a bit too pat as well. That said, there are many finely observed moments in the film and the actors work hard to give their characters some depth (even if not everyone can pull off the Boston accent). At the end of the day, it is probably a testament to Van Sant\u00e2(TM)s skill that this came off as well as it did; in the hands of a lesser director it could have been much soppier stuff.",

            "content": "Good Will Hunting is a 1997 drama that made 225.9 million dollars in box office earnings. It follows the story of Will Hunting, a 20 year old genius working as a janitor at MIT. While all his friends want him to do something with his life, he wants to stay where he is. After Will solves a graduate level math problem, Professor Gerald Lambeau is impressed with him, but Will soon gets arrested. Professor Lambeau makes a deal to keep Will out of jail, he has to study math with him and go to therapy once a week. Will refuses to take the therapy sessions seriously and multiple therapists refuse to talk to him again after only one session. Lambeau eventually goes to his former college roommate, Dr. Sean Maguire. Dr. Maguire gets Will to open up to him and helps him overcome his past and find what he wants. The purpose of the movie Good Will Hunting is to show that you only regret the chances you didn't take. I will show the purpose through plot, character, and conflict. \nYou only regret the chances you didn't take. That's how Dr. Sean Maguire feels about missing one of the greatest games in baseball history \"to see about a girl.\" After will asks him if he really missed game six of the World Series to have a drink with a girl, he tells him, \"I don't regret the 18 years I was married to Nancy. I don't regret the six years I had to give up counseling when she got sick. And I don't regret the last years when she got really sick. And I sure as hell don't regret missin' the damn game. That's regret.\" \nThroughout the film, Will's friends all want him to go to school, get a job, and do something with his life. Especially his best friend Chuckie. Every morning Chuckie hopes that Will's not home, that he finally left. He tells Will \"Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way. In twenty years, if you're still livin' here, comin' over to my house to watch the Patriots games, still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you.\" \"Hanging around here is a fuckin' waste of your time.\" He knows that Will is too smart to waste his life working construction when he could have an amazing job. Any one of their friends would kill for the opportunities Will has, yet he does nothing.\nThe main antagonist in Good Will Hunting is Will. The only thing holding him back from going to school and getting an amazing job is himself. When Professor Lambeau tells him he can be released as long as he does math and goes to therapy, Will laughs. He agrees to do the math but refuses to go to therapy. When he eventually gives in, he still doesn't take the therapy sessions seriously. He thinks he'll be happy where he is even though his friends know he's going to regret it eventually. After he talks to Dr. Maguire he realizes he needs to take the opportunity he's given.\nSome people say that the theme of Good Will Hunting is education, but that's only part of it. Yes Will needed to go to school, but he also needed the therapy sessions. Skylar was also a big part of the movie. Will needed the therapy sessions and Skylar to realize what he would be missing if he didn't take the opportunity. It wasn't just about school.\nGood Will Hunting was successful in showing the theme of regretting chances you never took. It was shown through Dr. Sean Maguire's character and throughout the plot of the movie. At the beginning he didn't care about his future but eventually he learned that he would regret passing up the opportunities that he was given.",

In between the thought-provoking scenes involving Damon and Williams is a clich\u00e9-ridden story told with characters that are not engaging nor have enough backstory for us, the audience, to care about. All I need to say is that it is a romance plot with the titular character and a girl and there's a misunderstood fight between them and....ugh....yeah. It's that same old 'song and dance' we all achingly know.\nIn fact, the effect the film had on me was a tug-of-war, pulling me back and forth between smart characters with smart dialogue and dumb characters with dumb dialogue. \nI'm teetering on the fence for \"Good Will Hunting\". I want to like this film, but I just can't stomach its amateur plot peppered with intelligent scenes. It (sadly) comes across as Hollywood trying to relate with the smart crowd and failing, which in turn, makes for a phony film.",

That because they have what we don't, there life is automatically better that ours. But that is not always true. Just because a man drives a better car than you, doesn't mean that he is going home to a better life. Good Will Hunting speaks to this concept in a unique way. By showing us a glimpse of a boy who could have anything, and yet is content with a life that is less than spectacular to say the least. And it is about another man's journey to show him that he is worth more. \n\tWill Hunting (Matt Damon) is a peculiar boy. He has the ability to think harder and more critically that anyone around him. But he would rather work as a janitor at Harvard, than attend. But one day while he is working, he sees a math theorem on a chalkboard and he solves it. As he is leaving, a Professor Lambau (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) spots him and upon realizing what will has done, he proceeds to track will down, finding him in jail, due to Will's unruly attitude. The Professor convinces the Judge to put Will under his care on the condition that Will attend some math classes with him and that he see a therapist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) \n\tThis movie does a very good job at developing the relationship between its characters. They are all centered around Will, giving the movie a well-grounded feel. The movie knows what it is trying to prove and does it very well. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's character has problem the worst relationship with Will, but that is only because he is the only one who could be seen as the antagonist. He wants Will to become the best he can be using his remarkable ability to think and learn. But in doing this, Skarsg\u00e5rd's character neglects Will's mental health and only thinks about what is good for his future. Robin Williams' character is different and it is his relationship with Will that carries this movie. In Williams' portrayal of physiatrist Sean Maguire, we see a man who character sees past Will incredible ability to think and can tell that he has had a hard life and that he is damaged into thinking he is less than what he is. He helps Will, first by showing him that just because he knows all the facts about everything, doesn't mean he know everything about everything. He is then able to help Will to realize that what happen to him in his childhood doesn't need to dictate his life.\n\t If there is something wrong with the movie, I would say it is the conflict. The idea is that Will needs to see a therapist because Professor Lambeau bailed him out of jail. But this is quickly forgotten as soon as we meet Sean. It just gives us the idea that things would go right back to the way they were if they were allowed to with no consequences. \n\tThis movie does a great job of showing us that we are more than just the thoughts in our brains. We matter, to ourselves and others, and that is worth more that money and fame. But it is important to be reminded of that from time to time. We like to feel loved and this movie helps us to realize that.",

One day, when he solves a seemingly impossible math problem, he finds himself under the mentorship of a few bright minds. Although he's got the potential to be basically anything he wants, his stubbornness and fears will push not only his mentors to the test, but himself.\n\nIf anything, watch this movie for the performances. A young Matt Damon and Ben Affleck should be enough to attract most people, but watching Robin Williams in one of his best films makes you feel like you're truly in the presence of greatness. The performances are all so amazing and I actually didn't expect Matt Damon to be this good. He plays this troubled teen who has so much potential but is so damaged that he refuses to do anything about it. I love his character and he's so relatable in so many ways. Ben Affleck's role wasn't too big, but he did co-write the film, so applause to him. I had never really seen a ton of Robin William's performances and seeing him in live action felt very real and genuine. I wasn't as happy with the late introduction of his character, but he was stellar none the less. Stellan Skarsgard also had a great performance with his stand out moments, and even Minnie Driver had her moments late in the game. \n\nThe screenplay was very well written in my opinion. It had a few stereotypes and predictable moments in there, and for the most part, it followed a fairly safe route. It did feel a little repetitive at times, as it felt like there were a lot of moments that followed the same dialogue structure and the biggest moments were fueled by purely dialogue. However, that's not always a bad thing, it just felt a little repetitive. It doesn't stray from the fact that I would replay certain scenes just for the monologues alone. \n\nThis movie is a great character study and it was so intriguing to learn more about these characters. There are so many relatable aspects that actually brought tears to my eyes. I smiled, I was impressed, and I wanted to cry all in one film. That's always a positive. \n\nNow, I wasn't in love with this movie. To me, there was nothing extremely unique about this film that I haven't necessarily seen before, but this movie is the favorite film of someone very close to me. With that being said, I know I'll be able to watch this film and smile, while remembering all of the happiness and tears it brought to someone's life. This film will always be considered a classic and I'm proud to own it in my collection.\n\nIn the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and although I didn't love it, it'll always hold a place in my heart for different reasons.",

Because beneath all that, it's a beautiful movie, with a beautiful script written by two talented young men and acted out by equally talented actors such as Robin Williams, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable parts of the movie was the psychological aspect. We have a typical 21 year old, going out and drinking with his friends, getting in fights etc., but underneath all that there's so much more to him. This movie tells us that we shouldn't look at the surface alone, there is so much more to people.\n\nThe acting in this movie was incredible, Matt Damon played the role of Will Hunting without fault, he displayed the emotions, the cockiness, he displayed how Will was closed off due to his childhood trauma and he displayed how Will shrouded his weakness with smart talk and intellect. Robin Williams played the therapist Sean Maguire, a man who has seen life unlike the life his fellow academics have, on the battlefield in Vietnam. He recently lost his wife, who he regarded as his soulmate and best friend.\n\nMatt Damon plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his out of this world genius. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben Affleck. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship. Yes there is a girl in the movie, but there isn't much focus on that aspect.\n\nThe fact that most of the people keep on talking about the probability of someone being as smart as Will tells us that this is a story, that this isn't real. Even so it relates to almost everyone who has been at Will's age. They have dealt with insecurities, fear of not being accepted, etc.\n\nOverall, I think it's a beautiful movie, with a beautiful message and amazing effort from everyone in the cast and crew. Especially from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who co-wrote the script for this movie. It is definitely a must watch",

I thought the counseling scenes with Robin Williams were quite engaging and they made me care more than I expected I would. However that's about the only aspect of the movie that worked for me. I never feel like Matt Damon disappears into the role of Will, so every emotional moment just feels like obvious acting. His friends added nothing to the movie for me, and Ben Affleck is an even worse actor. Yet the real sticking point I had was that, in a strange way, I found myself sympathizing with Stellan Skarsgard. I thought the movie was more engaging when it was exploring Will's genius, instead of his emotions. That's not to say it is a bad movie, but I didn't think it was anything all that special or unique. I could watch a dozen TV movies about damaged kids trying to move past their emotional detachment, but the diamond in the rough story is one that feels more cinematic and I thought needed to take center stage.

There isn't one thing that sticks out in this movie but is instead just overall such a solid piece. However after watching this movie year after year I can put my thumb on some of the aspects in this movie that does make it work. One positive of this movie was Matt Damon, he didn't just act as his character but became his character. This is because of Damon's understanding of his character, this is because Damon created his character. Matt Damon knew exactly what he was trying to create and was able to display it perfectly in this movie. Matt Damon is only complimented by Ben Afflecks, Robin Williams, and others roles. The development of the characters also work so well, none feel forced and it actually creates some suspense.\n\nThis movie also had a certain it factor to it. This movie has an undeniable it factor that connects to the audience like no other. This is created by the environment and attitude this movie creates.

It sort of reminded me of Ordinary People, which focused on a therapist/boy relationship. It's a wonderful script. One of the smartest ones ever written. The performances are spectacular, even after so many years. Yes, I wholeheartedly agree, this is the best performance of Robin William's career. This was one of the few time when award season truly got it right. He is magnificent here. I adored his character. Hindsight really helps, however. You can unfortunately see the dark, devastated side of Robin that lurked beneath his hilarious exterior showing itself throughout this performance. This is what depression looks like. This was, in fact, the real Robin Williams, and we lost him because of it. If you thought Good Will Hunting was sad then, it's even sadder now. Still, you'd be stupid not to watch it at least once.",

This is the type of movie I love. A movie about human struggle, human emotion, and human relationships, where the plot buildups aren't manufactured, but are real(or at least appear real). This is a masterpiece.\n\nWill Hunting is a janitor at MIT, who lives in a rundown one bedroom apartment in South Boston. He spends his nights drinking with his friends and looking for trouble. Will has been in trouble a lot, mostly assault charges and after he gets into another fight, the judge is about to throw the book at him. In his spare time, however, Will is an avid reader and a mathematical genius. After he solves a problem on a chalkboard at MIT, that few ever have; a professor tracks him down and gets him out of jail. The terms- that he works with the professor and sees a counselor. Soon Will is excelling at his work with the professor, but is guarded about his past and scared of his future.\n\nThe performances in Good Will Hunting are extraordinary. Matt Damon gives, what I believe to be, his best performance. He exudes pain and emotion, in a powerful performance. Robin Williams is equally as haunting, as Will's psychiatrist, who tries to get Will to open up and see his potential. Minnie Driver gives a great performance as Will's love interest. As good as the performances are, the best aspect of the movie is the great script by Damon and Affleck and solid direction from Gus Van Sant. \n\nThere are a lot of powerful moments through out Good Will Hunting, but none more than when Will finally reveals his past to the love interest, Skyler. It's a scene so real, not forced, not manufactured, but something that comes about in a natural progression of great storytelling. If you haven't seen Good Will Hunting, it is one that you should seek out.",

            "content": "Grade: Just gets in at 8/10\n\nGood Will Hunting is a movie that gets so many people talking, it is loved by many and the performances too. I felt as I watched just why do so many love it, I didn't think it was perfection but there is no doubt this is an interesting piece of cinema with it's smart plot and emotionally charged characters. I did feel it was very good and although only just about, it still manages to really let you enjoy it.\n\nThe first thing to say about this is Robin Williams who is at his very best here. He just feels so excellent as his role as Sean Maguire who as you will see councils Will Hunting and he adds an extra element to this movie Robin does. All the cast are fairly strong here, Matt Damon as Will is good and really shows us what he has got for his future film career. Cast such as Ben Affleck aren't really shown as much as the two I mentioned but him among his brother Casey Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard form a good little cast for this type of film. \n\nBen Affleck and Matt Damon of course write the movie and they do a great job, not only capturing everyday life situations well, but adding in Will Hunting to those scenes to make it feel smart and funny. I did however feel it was slightly contrived, mostly in the way they want to get a certain emotion out of you, sometimes you can laugh and sometimes you can be sad, even times when they want you to think \"Oh wow he's smart that Will Hunting\". I will also add that the script though is really showcasing the talent these two guys have, and I do feel like these guys really are an example to look up to when aspiring screenwriters come up.\n\nGus Van Sant directs it well and his job is made easier by the fine script brought to him. He manages to delicately direct it without making the film feel done before or too much like a typical piece of cinema. Van Sant also could be said to contribute to Williams performance and you can see Gus really worked well with the cast to make them bring the most out of the script. Another delicate thing is the score, now when you making a film about a genius from Boston, Danny Elfman doesn't always spring to mind but he manages to beautifully score it and the music is really one thing I remember the most about watching the movie.\n\nOne good thing about the movie is that it is smart, not only in movie terms but in terms of the script and the actors who all seem to remember there lines so well, it almost feels like they all know mathematics like we see in the film. I think all the credit goes to Affleck and Damon who if I'm not mistaken, are not mathematic geniuses but do the screenplay in such a way that it feels like a professor has written parts of the film.\n\nOverall it is the ending that is the real pay off, of course I'm not going to ruin it for you but lets just say it makes you feel emotion and really draws you close to the characters we see so much of in this movie. Overall this is totally worth a watch, not only for people thinking \"It's Oscar nominated, it must be good\", but also people who just want an interesting film, not for those who want action or true thrills but it is definitely one for the thinkers and maybe even the unidentified genius.",

The fact that he's incredibly smart isn't the bulk of his character. It's moreso about how he chooses to use it, if at all, and what the people around him think he should do. A lot of different outlooks on what his intelligence is meant for come about. It's used as an engine to explore what it really means to get the most out of life. I liked seeing his evolution from start to finish, from a smart douche bag to a likable douche bag, and finally to a very complex person I sympathized with entirely.\n\nOn a technical side, it's all great. Great screenplay, nice acting, solid pacing, and a plot that wasn't at all predictable. The score was a peculiar choice: all the tracks are very light and have a sense of whimsy, which really only seemed to match up with the movie's tone towards the end. I liked it, though. I enjoyed every aspect of Good Will Hunting.",

The movie follows the emotional story of a janitor that works at Harvard school and is extremely smart but as his past emotions come back to haunt him, he becomes confused with the direction he wants to take. Matt Damon and Robin Williams play the main characters, Will and Sean, and are perfectly cast in these roles. The two have the best chemistry out of pretty much any movie I've ever seen. It's crazy. These two have pasts that haunt them and sort of plays a factor in their understanding for each other. The stories of how they were treated when they were younger were tragic and really messed up. How Will was beaten with a wrench as a kid is really wrong and depressing. The conversations that Will and Sean have are part of the reason why I love this movie. They tell really relatable stories and can really touch a certain audience. The acting really throughout the whole movie is really good. Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver are the big standouts. The movie is pretty funny too, whenever Will is with his friends, I was laughing quite a bit. It's funny how this film is able to be really dramatic and emotional but make you crack a smile every once and a while. As for the ending of the movie, I was thinking \"you know what would make this movie really awesome? If Will went to California to be with Skylar\" (spoiler alert) I'll just say I loved the ending! The music, the atmosphere, the dialogue of that ending was just perfect. Good Will Hunting is an inspirational, relatable, funny, emotional, and awesome movie. A",

It's got some stunning performances too. Will Hunting (Damon) is a janitor who works at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he's from South Boston and never had much of an education, but he happens to be a genius, a self-taught one too. But instead of doing something with his life, he spends much of his free time drinking with his friends Chuckie (Affleck), Billy (Cole Hauser), and Morgan (Casey Affleck). When Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) discovers Will's gift, he decides to help him. After getting Will out of jail after a fight, the condition is Will do maths with Lambeau, and be counselled by Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), who is determined to help Will and his demons. It's a great little character piece with some colourful characters, and it's also a love letter to Damon and Affleck's native Boston too. They rightfully won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for their script, while the story might be predictable, it's the characters that drive the story along, and it's very sharp and observant.",

Many of the supporting roles were also very well done, especially the performances of Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver. Matt Damon played the part he wrote for himself extremely well, and I'm not sure which was better, his script writing or his ability to make the troubled genius that is Will Hunting come alive.

            "content": "Although now Matt Damon is a bona fide superstar with an action trilogy and a heist trilogy both securely under his belt, there was a time when he wasn't so well known as to have his own marionette in Team America. With a few bit parts and a couple of supporting roles behind him, Damon had yet to make any sort of lasting mark on cinema. Ben Affleck, similarly, hadn't yet moved into the legitimate public eye, despite roles in Chasing Amy and Dazed and Confused. Then there was Good Will Hunting.\u00a0\n\nThe story follows a South Boston construction worker with an unusual gift for mathematics. After he's discovered by an MIT professor and put under his supervision as a result of an assault charge, he's suddenly faced with a lot of important decisions.\u00a0\n\nGus Van Sant's direction here is flawlessly old school. Long, lingering shots with minimalist camera work and just the right amount of emotion makes for some beautifully restrained work. Think David Fincher's work with the Social Network but with less cutting. The nature of the film demands a careful balance of humour and emotion and Van Sant never drops the ball. When it's supposed to be funny, you'll be laughing. When you're meant to be sad, there will be tears. Despite his often childlike apporach to the material, he is able to be unflinchingly mature in the moments that call for it. It's this versatility which is the mark of a great director that Van Sant displays so intuitively here.\u00a0\n\nGood Will Hunting also features one of Danny Elfman's more diverse compositions, a bittersweet combination of keys and strings with a lilting pipe tune which stays with you for a while. It may verge on twee on the odd occassion but it's used with enough restraint that it doesn't become a crutch or substitute for real emotion. The real standout of the soundtrack is Elliott Smith's Oscar nominated song \"Miss Misery.\" Hitting just the right note, his full stop at the end of the film is sweetly depressing as well as marking a new chapter for our main character.\u00a0\n\nSpeaking of the Academy Awards, one of the biggest draws of the film is the Oscar winning script penned by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Thirteen years on and it's still as powerful as it ever was, managing to walk the line between stilted and realistic with an uncanny instinct for everyday conversations and natural dialogue. Even Will's super smart outbursts are grounded by the film's realistic feel. But the screenplay's greatest achievement is the raw emotion that it is capable of evoking. Scenes such as Skylah and Will's fight in the dorm room linger in the mind long after the final credits have rolled. In particular the dialogue between Will and Sean is incredibly powerful, their exchanges both layered and meaningful. Their relationship development is incredibly rewarding, moving from the sizing up of two boys from Southie to two friends with grace and realism. The elegance and simplicity of the plot is astoundingly straightforward with no sudden, attention seeking twists or unstable divergences, instead focussing on extracting every moment of nuance and emotion from various conversations between the characters. It's an incredible achievement, especially in light of the fact that it's the writing debut of Damon and Affleck.\u00a0\n\nThe two of them don't let down in the acting department either, with both of them turning in brilliant performances. Damon's character is the main character of the piece and as such his performance is more rewarding in depth and evolution but Affleck does well with the screentime allotted to him. He is funny and loudmouthed as well as playing the role of Will's best friend with uncharacteristic restraint. Damon's performance easily outshines him, however, moving from dangerously inflamed to easy-going with style. Jason Bourne may be his best known character but his performance here is so beautifully vulnerable and simply realistic that it's easily his best performance to date. His love interest in the film is a delightful Minnie Driver who is able to evoke a goofy sense of humour at times while being undeniably powerful in the more emotional scenes. But the star here is Robin Williams, the manic stand-up bringing forth an incredible performance filled with nuance and humour as well as depth and vulnerability. His delivery of some exquisitely crafted speeches make an incredible document almost obsolete with such astounding timing and realism that it's difficult to tell where the acting ends and Williams begins. He is quietly, understatedly brilliant in the midst of an incredible cast.\u00a0\n\nWith an eternally brilliant script, beautiful direction and amazing performances all round, Good Will Hunting is as close to perfect as movies get.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nTough one to pick but it has to be Sean and Will's second meeting. A rivetting piece of acting from Williams combined with one of the best monologues in the film.",

            "content": "Released to near universal critical acclaim in 1997, Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting is a youth film, written by its young stars, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, at the very beginning of their respective careers, largely memorable due to its incredibly effective distillation of the hubristic follies of young adulthood, charming in its innate self-assuredness, a veritable Catcher in the Rye of the late 1990's. And yet, much of the film is carried on the shoulders of the Oscar winning supporting role given by the late, great comic actor Robin Williams, whose turn as Damon's therapist is moving in its authenticity, belying the respective artifice of the surrounding drama, including Damon's titular role, the film clinging to Williams' inability to turn in a false performance, his deep well of humanity imbuing the film with all of the empathy that the script lacks even the awareness of. Likewise, Van Sant feels aimless and lost in his direction of the film, unable to take the viewer anywhere interesting or tangible, moving from one passing point of interest to another without providing a larger dramatic context for much of the film's capricious ennui, the entire film shapeless and ephemeral, tonally and thematically vacant. Damon and Affleck have both proven themselves to be creative and capable performers, but Good Will Hunting is not their greatest work, marking it as something of an oddity, its credible encapsulation of the universality of youth its simultaneous flaw, the film coming off as prophetically hopeful for a future that is still unrealized in the minds of its protagonists, not to mention its screenwriters. For all intents and purposes, Good Will Hunting is a good movie, capturing the aimless antics of its precocious miscreant accurately, but without grasping the larger poeticism of his world, Van Sant's film in the same state of arrested development as its subject.\n\nThroughout the film, Damon's Will Hunting is presented to the audience as an immediately likable protagonist, troubled by a past that remains as vague to the audience as it does to the film itself, Hunting's history of domestic abuse at the hands of his foster father as believable as any of the other lies Hunting employs over the course of the film in order to remain detached, immune, and incapable of the responsibilities of adulthood, as personified by Stellan Skarsgard's professorial interest in Hunting's innate mathematic abilities. Despite the script's sophomoric good will towards Hunting's trials and tribulations, his memorable wooing of Minnie Driver's moneyed pre-med student made problematic by his own self-loathing and lack of self-worth, much of the internal drama feels shallow, lifted from greater scripts and stories to no effect when translated to the film's dramatization of working class Bostonians. Left with no scriptural evidence for his protagonist's deep soulfulness, Van Sant is forced to shoot several sequences in which Damon lounges with an air of disgruntlement, his constant slouching and listless gaze indicative of a humanity that is dramatically absent, leaving the film cinematically listless as well. Damon and Affleck attempt to gain the audience's sympathy again and again, imploring the viewer through scene after scene of weighty dialogue, attempting to present Hunting as a misguided Boston tough worthy of praise and upward mobility, his erudite and pithy demeanor one worth saving. And yet, for all of the empathy that the script seems to feel for Hunting, Hunting feels none for the viewer, divorcing Van Sant's film of the empathy in its protagonist that is necessary for any dramatic catharsis to feel well earned, as opposed to the abrupt inconclusiveness on display in Hunting's climactic departure for California.\n\nIn order for a film about the turmoil of youth to work, there must be a base line from which the audience may empathize with the film's protagonist, and that protagonist must in turn be capable of empathy, else the audience feel disconnected from the film in much the same way that the protagonist feels disconnected from the world. At the time when Good Will Hunting was written, Damon and Affleck were barely out of their 20's themselves, and thus still caught up in their own personal journeys of self-discovery, lending their script much of the tumultuous and unformed aura of their own respective immaturities at the time. While some of this irreverence for and of the world undoubtedly lends the film much of its viscerally driven appeal, Damon's Will Hunting and Affleck's Chuckie Sullivan as eager to move onward and upward as the stars themselves, this eagerness largely comes off as ignorant navel gazing, assuredly striving towards something greater that is still clouded by the ego of young adulthood. After all, one of the most deceptive aspects of youth is its assuredness that everything is easily remedied, as one's solutions at the time predominantly extend only so far as to help oneself, the larger world still far off in the realm of full blown maturity and a more worldly understanding of other people's needs, hopes, and desires as compared to your own. Will Hunting definitively reaches personal discovery by film's end, but his decision to leave town without letting anyone know, including his new employers, marks his final decision as one made without any forethought, his development in a state of continual arrested self-involvement, getting the girl but not coming of age, marking Van Sant's film as shallow and incomplete, its centripetal preoccupation with youth as stunted and belligerent as an unruly teenager.\n\nFor all of its atonality and narrative missteps, Good Will Hunting is persistently watchable, carried by Robin Williams' respective maturity and empathy, lending Damon's Will Hunting just enough humility and pathos to evoke sympathy in the viewer for his plight. And yet, despite the compelling likability generated by Williams' award worthy performance, the sympathy that is generated in the viewer comes off as overtly manipulative, marking the film as the irretrievable dramatic failure that it always has been, a youth film where the adult is the real hero. Where other great coming of age masterpieces situate their young protagonists at the moral center, Damon's Will Hunting must be taught empathy from an elder, his own ability to emote stunted by a preoccupation with the self that proves to be too all-consuming to allow for any true dramatic progression on his own terms, causing the film to sputter and gasp for air in a deluge of self-pity and painfully rendered, self-aggrandizing monologues, apologetic, but never sincere. Contrastingly, Mike Nichols' 1967 opus, The Graduate, imbues Dustin Hoffman's anti-hero with all of the morals and guilt that should by all rights be found in his elders, which is why the ending is so satisfying, the two youths escaping one corrupt adult world for another of their own potential making and subsequent undoing; in a similar vein, Robert Redford's 1980 tragedy, Ordinary People, is moving in the way in which it leaves Timothy Hutton's emotionally scarred survivor, having braved his way through both literal and figurative storms only to find himself alone on the shore, finally a man, but weighed down with all of the trappings and responsibilities rightly associated with his newfound maturity. Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting is as harrowing and tumultuous a drama as either of these two greater films, but without any sense of true progression, dramatic or otherwise, Damon's titular youth in much the same way as he was at the start of the film, sympathetic perhaps, but incapable of the type of empathy that is necessary to the youth film genre's continued relevance and poetic resonance, Will Hunting respectively withdrawn and figuratively restrained, Van Sant's film a study in emotional stagnancy.",

He hangs out nights with his worthless friends that work construction, drink, and make fart jokes.  Will has hidden fears due to a tragic past that led to him being raised as an abused orphan.  One day, a man discovers Hunting's genius and tries to help him out by having him talk to a friend who has his own troubles.  Can Will overcome his inner fears and find happiness?\n\n\"There's only so many times you can bang your friend's future wife.\" \n\nGus Van Sant, director of Elephant, Milk, Restless, Promised Land, To Die For, Finding Forester, My Own Idaho, and Drugstore Cowboy, delivers Goodwill Hunting.  The storyline for this picture is intricate and well delivered.  The characters are very interesting and the dialogue is fairly solid.  The cast delivers excellent performances and includes Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser.\n\n\"He was so fucking hammered he drove the wrong car home.\"\n\nThere's always a movie on your \"ashamed you haven't seen\" list, this was one of those for me, for the longest.  I found this on Netflix and decided to cross it off the list.  This wasn't as good as I expected.  I thought it would be on par with American Beauty; unfortunately, I felt the film fell a little short and Robin Williams character wasn't as dramatic as I hoped.  Overall, this is definitely worth a viewing, but isn't worth adding to your DVD collection.\n\n\"Go home and give it a tug yourself.\"\n\nGrade: B+/A-",

Robin Williams is first-billed for this film, but it is 30 minutes in before we first meet his character.  Also, it takes until the end of the film for Will to finally have his inevitable breakthrough, leaving only five minutes to resolve his problems instead of half a movie.\n\nBut for better or for worse, \"Good Will Hunting\" has a character-driven plot.  And fortunately, the characters in this film are very strong.  I really like the characters and what the actors bring to them, and I especially like the interplay between Robin Williams and Matt Damon.  Their performances, along with Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's, make the film.\n\n\"Good Will Hunting\" is a touching, heart-filled drama.

            "content": "The wonderful thing about certain films is that they can resonate with you as a person, you can feel the characters pain or anguish because you have been through a smiliar process. For me, Good Will Hunting, strikes those chords and its not because i think im a genius who should be doing something better with his life, its because the main message of this film is so strong that everyone on the planet can relate to it. Good Will Hunting, follows the story of a troubled youth called Will, He and his friends, typically go out, they drink, they get in fights. In fact Will actually has quite the criminal history. The flip side is he is one of the smartest mathematitions around. He is noticed by Jerry, a Lecturer at one of Americas most prestigious universities after Will has secretly been completely extremely complex algorythms. Jerry decides to go out on a limb and come to an agreement with the courts. If Jerry works with Will every week and also gets Will to successfully endure therapy, the judge will drop the case. Cue Sean, one of Jerry's old friends from college, the only therapist to relate with Will, trying to set him on the correct path. Good Will Hunting is a master stroke of genius. Its hard to believe that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, the 2 co stars of this movie wrote the thing, the dialogue, although a bit forced in some places, is some witty, so intellectual and thoughtful to think that 2 kids could come up with that, is amazing. It also helps that the talent behind this film is immense. Gus Vant Sant directs, Lawrence Bender, Kevin Smith and the Weinsteins all produce. The cast, which includes, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Stellan Starsgard, Casey Affleck, Minnie Driver and of course the late great Robin Williams are all absolutely on the button, it sends this film into the stratosphere. The relationships here are all genuine and heart braking. Wither it be the heart aching relationship between lovers Will and Skyler or Will and Sean, every relationship has a meaning, it has weight, it has an important reason to be within the film. Which is why at no point does the film include any forced material or even needless material. The acting ranges from good to superb. Matt Damon, Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Williams and Casey Affleck all knock it straight out of the ball park. Ben Affleck works well enough as Will's best friend, however his character is a little under developed and under utilized. Minnie Driver is also reasonable but kind of gets swept under the carpet here by the surrounding talent. The pacing is wonderful, you are never board, you are never twiddling your thumbs waiting for something monumental to happen, your too engrossed on the screen. Van Sant gets us up close and personal with his characters also, even in some of the rawest moments between Williams and Damon, after Will rubs up his therapist about his dead wife, the camera is right up in the action, right in the emotion. You cant help but feel the surge of power come from their performances. The film looks great and over 15 years old, it still looks the part, it almost feels timeless. It could almost be set in modern day. There are very few things wrong with this movie, yeah there are a couple of minor characters who are just in there to fill the screen at points and some of the dialogue, mostly between the younger characters can be a bit forced and dated but it doesnt take away from the over all experience. Finally, now more than ever, and not that this film should be judged on the credentials of one actor, but watching this film after Williams departure with us, serves as a reminder of what a loss we truely have experienced in the film world. His therapy during the film is heart  braking, to watch him re-tell stories of him and his wife, or try and make Will understand what life is all about, knowing the troubles he later went through in life, still makes for a very hard watch. It's difficult to not get teary eyed while watching this film. But that is not a bad thing, that serves as an ode to Williams and the sheer dominance he had at his job. A brilliant film, with brilliant performances and a fantastic script. A must see.",

Yes, Williams is top billed in the film, but quite rightly his Oscar has the word \"Supporting\" engraved on it.  Williams IS amazing, but he's one cog in a sensational ensemble cast - not a rotten apple in the bunch. The perfs are all fearless and peerless. I especially love the Chuckie scenes. Yet Affleck and Damon excel at the writing as much as the acting. Williams' monologue about meeting his wife is golden, but Skarsgard is gifted with some poetry too.

Matt Damon too gives an incredibly talented performance with drive and intensity I was not expecting. It is also fortunate that the screenplay and the direction of the film, if not a little predictable, can match the performances to create such an emotional and heart touching story of development within Matt Damon's title character. It is this character development too, that is done with perfect pace and nice added aspects such as Hunting's relationship with the spectacular Minnie Driver character, or his loyalty to his friends, that makes the film so grasping, truly showing off the feeling and emotions of a troubled boy. I also enjoyed how the film did not just focus on the development of Hunting and was able to highlights Will's effect on both Sean McGuire (Williams) and Jerry Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard and the associated impact he has on their lives. This film reaks of rich character development, incredibly emotional scenes and intense performances to  sweep away its expected outcome and predictable scenes and come out pretty good, surprisingly funny and entertaining.",

            "content": "This is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. Everybody that stars in this movie is fantastic, including Ben Affleck. Director Gus Van Zant who directed \"Drugstore Cowboy,\" and \"Milk,\" has made without a doubt one of the best movies of the 1990's. It's such an emotional and wonderful movie to watch that it sticks with you the moment your done watching it. Matt Damon in my opinion gives the best performance of his career in this movie playing Will Hunting, the genius kid from South Boston who solves the big math equation that Stellan Skarsgard's character leaves in the hallway for his the students to solve to only have it mysteriously solved by Damon's character who happens to be the janitor of the college he works at. But for me it's really Robin Williams that sticks out the most for me just because it's Robin freakin' Williams, who gives in my opinion a career defining performance as the therapist that tries to help counsel Damon's character in order to keep him out of jail for getting into a brawl with Affleck and the rest of the crew against these Italians that hang out in the South Boston area and hits a cop in the process of being pulled back from almost beating one of the Italian guys to death. It's a very human performance, one that makes this one very different from all the other performances he has done on screen. It's the one that definitely made him worth of the best supporting oscar that year in 1997. Sure he cracks some good jokes here and there in the film, but he never shies away from his dramatic side through out the movie. Williams has played a lot of great characters on screen, but when I think about which one is my favorite, this performance is the first one to enter my head. I can't say enough about his performance because it felt so real to me the whole time, especially when he goes into talking to Damon's character about his wife who in the film has been dead for two years, but you can clearly see he is still grieving from the loss. And could you blame him? I mean for a man who loved his wife as much as he did in this movie you can see how hard it would be for a person like William's character to move on with his life. It's really when him and Damon really get into it in one therapy session about what Damon's character wants to do with his life and he can't give Williams character a straight answer and when tries to kick Damon out of the therapy session, that's when Damon confronts him and tells him that even though he lost a big hand that some people after losing a big hand like that have the sack to get back up and try again...and he's right. Both men are very compelling in the film and what makes the movie so great is the interaction between Damon and Williams that through the therapy sessions, both men learn to heal and move on with their lives, that's what makes the movie so great. I literally balled my eyes out when I was watching the movie last night with my sister at the scene when Williams character tells Damon that it's not his fault to what happened to him as a foster child, but Damon's character doesn't want to hear it, but Williams keeps pursuing Damon to realize that it is not your fault that were abused it was the asshole foster father that is to blame for beating him. And what makes it so great is that at one point Damon gets defensive and pushes Williams away telling him not to fuck with him, but Williams doesn't let down and keeps telling him it's not your fault. And when the two men finally embrace each other and hug it out it's truly a work of art, and in that scene Gus Van Zant definitely deserved the best director nomination for the movie. Such a compelling scene that I'm almost feeling the emotions as I'm writing this. This is a movie that will live on through the ages, and it should, because this is a movie that hits you where it hits best...right in the heart.",

Despite loving his mainstream roles, I was keen to explore 'good will hunting' due to the overwhelming appraisal it received. It tells an interesting tale of a child genius who's talents are seemingly going to waste working as the colleges janitor. The reasons for Wills reluctance are soon expertly explored by Sean (Williams), creating for some very thought provoking and slickly executed scenes. Our leads gradual development; and eventually surprising decision, is fascinating to watch, yet were it not for the great acting I would expect them to be considerably dull. Having watched a few of Damon's earlier performances, I'm beginning to think that he has got worse as an actor. This may of course be due to the type of monotonous role that he is often put into, although he definitely manages to portray much more passion and emotion in this when compared to his other work. Williams however is undoubtedly the star of the show. His dialogue and demean is a joy to behold, so as to keep the film interesting.\n\nDespite the ending being expectantly charming, I did feel as though it lacked drama and punch. The romantic element; which ultimately plays a much larger role than expected, is also somewhat weak. This is perhaps Damon's downfall, as he often looks lost when trying to portray the right emotion in response to the female attention. However in general I enjoy what it had to offer, without finding it overly exciting or pungent, although the acting is first class.",

This remains one of my favorite movies, a nearly perfect little dynamo, which I would give a perfect 5 to if it had a better title.  The lame title is its one real flaw, and a pretty irrelevant one.  At the time, much was made over how these kids (yet to become the massive stars they would shortly) had written it themselves and made it happen, and indeed there is a wondrous sense of the amateur about this movie, amateur in the best and original sense of the word.  The movie is warm, funny, witty and cathartic.  And then there is the late, dearly missed Robin Williams,  whose film career is notable for being by turns wonderful and horrible.   Here, he is as marvelous as he's ever been.  Little note: anyone who sniffs about his Boston accent, it is barely noticeable, I actually didn't think he was attempting one at all it until it was pointed out to me.  \n\nI'm clearly not the only one enchanted by this movie, which still has a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

The script which was written by Affleck and Matt Damon is a terrific piece of writing, and the result shows on-screen, as this is a picture that is sure to grab your attention from start to finish due to its energetic story and intricate performances that really stand out. Good Will Hunting is an accomplished drama, a picture that is sure to appeal to any viewer that enjoys a well crafted work of drama, Gus Van Sant's direction is terrific as well, and he delivers one of his finest films. Robin Williams is also a noteworthy cast member and he can definitely a dramatic role, which really shows off his range, and he did that so well in Dead Poets Society and he would later deliver a blistering, tense performance in One Hour Photo. Here, he is stunning, and opposite Damon, steals the show. Matt Damon would make other stunning picture, but here, he takes on a great role, one that is conflicted, and well fleshed out, and Matt Damon really brings that to light here. He brings out the best out of the character, and he is perfect for the part. With a great script, great cast, and effective, immaculate direction, Good Will Hunting is a stunning picture, one that is thoroughly engaging from start to finish, and it is a highly captivating picture that you won't forget. This is the type of picture that sticks with you long after you've seen, and it's also a film well worth revisiting again and again. The film also showcased the writing talents of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, of which Affleck would later write some stunning films such as The Town and Argo, but here, this was a script he wrote when his career was taking off, and it's great to see that he showed terrific writing skills when his career was taking off. Good Will Hunting is a terrific picture, one that is well worth your time.",

He works as a janitor and he has a photographic memory. His gift allows him to excel in the field of mathematics but chooses to live a life drinking with his friends and not fulfilling his life's potential.\nWith his life slowly crashing and burning he gets help from a university professor and a psychiatrist to rebuild his life and solve the problems from his past and focus on his future.\n\nThis is a warm hearted movie, it may not seem like it initially as we're introduced to an intimidating Will Hunting but the movie sets it up and executes his motives quite effectively. \nThe group of friends he hangs out with is a lot of fun. Their constant jokes and mocking of each other cracks me up and makes me wish I have friends as awesome as they are. We are welcomed to their group and it is established who is the smart one, the dumb one, the best mate, you get it and it just wants me be involved so much.\nSeeing Robin Williams here is interesting. Just like in my recent review of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and seeing Jim Carrey play in a drama proved to be achieved in a believable and compelling way. The same goes for Williams. Both actors were famous for their outrageous comedic personalities and performances and now having them appear in dramas shakes my head in amazement. \nBack to William's character, he was solid, charismatic and likeable. He reminds me of the cuddly uncle I never had. The one who would give advice about life and share stories to his grandchildren, William's portrayed him very well.\n\nWhat sets the bar quite high here is the script and connection we have between all the characters. The dialogue is written so well with some perfect one liners, jokes and memorable quotes. Conversations aren't at all convenient and by that I mean written in a corny way or sappy fashion. Break up, conflict and social scenes are so natural and doesn't make it feel fake at any point.\n\n'Good Will Hunting' is a spectacular movie. It definitely fed me inspiration in a way a regular personal development speaker would not be able to. No surprise it won some Oscars. \nChances are after you see this it'll be part of your long term movie collection.",

It's all through Damon's brilliant performance that you like a character who could have just been so unlikeable. Robin Williams is just fantastic. I know he's very well remembered for roles like Mrs Doubtfire or Hook but I will always remember him for this amazing role. He's utterly brilliant here and he's just the nicest and most love able guy. I love just seeing him try and be friends with Will and when he starts yelling at him I'm completely with him. Ben and Casey Affleck are both brilliant, especially Ben who gives one of his best performances. Stellar Skarsgard is also fantastic. This film is so well directed by Gus Van Sant and while it's not the most flashy movie it's still one of his best.

But here's the catch, he has to do mathematics and has to go see a therapist, he eventually agrees.\n\n\nHe goes to see Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), the professor's college roommate, now a college professor who also had a dark past but is a gifted and smart consoler, Skylar (Minnie Driver), is a British girl at Harvard, who falls in love with Will and wants to help, and has his buddy Chuckie (Ben Affleck), all four of these people teaches him life edges.\n\n\nAt first, the plot may seem strange, Math? Therapy? Romance? Strange combination but it works.Gus Van Sant knows well with honest dialogue, like in the scene when Will and Skylar breakup because he feels he doesn't deserve her.\n\n\n\"Good Will Hunting\" is predictable but it's life edges is what makes it effective. It's deeply honest and sad. Damon and Affleck's first little script won Oscars and Robin Williams won Best Supporting Actor. This was worth the watch while having stomach flu.\n\nShane Zaborski",

His sheer humanness has something to teach, or remind, us all: be vulnerable. Be vulnerable to vulnerability.\n\nAnd Will shows that that's not as easy as it sounds. It's scary, aye. It can hurt so much, aye. But it pays off. Eventually it'll pay off. We should not idealise our love. We should not fall in love with ideas of people. We should know them inside out; let them not be strangers but our doubles. The courage to do this, I believe, will be infectious. It'll bring warring nations together. Ironic, this: that courage is not the ability to hold up a sword against a Goliath, but to drop it, to leave the Goliath, that is cynicism and pain and fear itself, to get to us, eat us, slam us, do whatever it wants, for good or bad.\n\nGood Will Hunting rings of emotional truth: painful but unsentimental, serious but humorous, saddening but heartening.",

Together with the help of an MIT professor (Stellan Skarsgard) and a psychologist (Robin Williams) he comes to understand his true potential. The best parts of the film are the many dialogue scenes, some emotionally deep and others biting, that add so much depth to the characters. This was a passion project for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and it shows. The dialogue felt natural and true to life, which adds to the authenticity of the overall experience. Though everyone (including Ben Affleck) turns in an excellent performance, Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good. Matt Damon is the hard-headed young adult who is afraid to let people in, and Robin Williams is a professor with experience and insight that he uses to get to Will. Even though the narrative structure wasn't the tightest, there was something to enjoy about every scene, and all of them added something to the overall picture. I should also mention that Minnie Driver does a great job as Will's girlfriend, and Casey Affleck has a few of the best lines. As far as other aspects go I enjoyed the score, which was never intrusive or told the audience how to feel. There was also a rather eclectic soundtrack which fit the moods of various scenes perfectly. Overall, it was a superbly written film with equally good performances. Highly recommended.",

This depresses me, because although these films are popular now, I don't see them becoming classics anytime in the future, and they are overhyped so much it degrades their actual quality. Good Will Hunting is nothing like this. This film is the definition of an instant classic, a stupendously written and emotionally powerful film that has three celebrated actors (Matt Damon, Robin Williams, and Ben Affleck) bringing their A-game. Not many movies are like this, which is both a good and a bad thing-- on one hand, if all movies were dialogue-driven dramas, people might be bored to tears. But at the same time, can't we ask for a little more intelligent scriptwriting from screenwriters these days?\r\n\r\nGood Will Hunting is one of the best films of the 1990s, and easily one of the best in general. Starring Matt Damon in his best role yet as a genius savant who can make complicated calculations and mathematical proofs in his head, and Robin Williams as his tenacious therapist, this emotionally gripping movie will absolutely knock you off your feet. Damon's conflicted character is one of the best ever created-- he is undoubtedly a genius, but lacks all motivation to act on it. The movie leaves the audience with an ambiguous ending. When you have an incredible gift, are you obligated to share it with the world, or should you chase your dreams, no matter what they are? Although I agree with the latter, there are plenty of arguments for both sides, all of which are presented in this movie. \r\n\r\nAt its core, Good Will Hunting is a two-sided character study, half about Damon's character and half about Williams's. The scenes in which these two personalities clash are the best in the movie. Right from the beginning, you know this won't be your ordinary drama: Damon wrecks Williams within the first five minutes of therapy, and Williams retaliates the next day with a complete debasing of Damon's cocky indifference to the world around him. I love it when two characters in a movie see the world in completely different ways, and these two personify that 110%. Their dialogue is sharply written, funny, and heartfelt. I didn't cry (as usual), but I did find myself biting my lip at the end.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Good Will Hunting: 9/10 stars. This is one of the greats, and should be recognized as such-- it was robbed of Best Picture by Titanic, of all things (although LA Confidential is a bit better). The characters are well-defined, the drama is impeccably acted, and although it verges a little to close to cloying sentimentality, it always knows when to pull back with some biting humor and great one-liners. A must-see.",

So Rob declares a third time:\r\n'It's not your fault,' Wow! It's like.. the more he says it, the truer it gets.\r\nWill's having none of it. He's one tough cookie. \r\n'I know,' he smirks. His smirk conceals his profound, intellectual sorrow(a very Oscar-worthy variety of sorrow).\r\n'It's not your fault,' repeats Rob meaningfully.\r\nWill begins to shift with unease. His body language seems to say: 'Please desist from saying that. I am very uncomfortable with these proceedings,'\r\nBut it is necessary to say it again, reckons Rob. \r\n'It's not your fault.' He's a persistent chap, this psychiatrist fellow.\r\nWill is by now deeply perturbed. His lips are quivering. His eyes are wet. \r\n'Don't fuck with me,' he whimpers helplessly.\r\nBut Rob is merciless. He proceeds to say 'It's not your fault' a few more times, until eventually Will bursts into tears.\r\nSuccess! The impenetrable genius has been cracked. Rob takes him in his hairy embrace. They weep and hug away the pain. \r\nIn the last shot of this highly emotional scene, a glint of triumph appears in Rob's eyes. It's as though he is already thinking: 'I am definitely gonna win an Oscar for this.'",

            "content": "The Well Executed Performance of Good Will Hunting \n\tLawrence Bender's film, Good Will Hunting, depicts a story of a troubled young adult, Will, as he develops from a former foster kid into a recognized genius with the capabilities to master some of mathematics' toughest equations. Under the care of MIT's Professor Lambeau, Will is assigned to work on mathematical equations with the extra burden of going to therapy once a week, all in order to stay out of trouble. His therapist, Sean Maguire proceeds to challenge Will throughout the movie as Sean proposes ideas pertaining to life lessons and experiences. Not only does Sean Maguire challenge Will, Will also challenges Sean. This adds a certain depth to the phenomenally organized plot executed with the extraordinary performances from the emotional, genuine actors being: Matt Damon (Will), Robin Williams (Sean), and Minnie Driver (Skylar). The actors give believable performances with a script so cleverly written that it covers realms of humor, deep emotion, physical and mental pain, and moments of light-heartedness, that leaves the audience intrigued with memorable moments and quotes. \n\tMatt Damon portrays Will in a convincing and authentic way. He fully captures emotional scenes such as one with Minnie in which his facial expressions, physicality, and anger are mesmerizing, as they reflect Will's memories of his horrible and haunting past. In addition, he masters the light humorous scenes, such as when he jokes around with the prestigious therapists, convincing them he is insane. Minnie Driver also provides a refreshing take on the \"smart girl\" character as she provides a humorous performance and genuine emotion when she experiences heartache. She shows this through her mannerisms, such as wanting physical touch, when she wants to be loved. Moreover, Robin Williams presents a vulnerability masked by professionalism; yet the look in his eyes, the facial expressions, and the placement of his hands depicts his character's emotional pain in a hidden way. \nEven more so, the chemistry between Robin Williams and Matt Damon is the epitome of great acting, which adds flair and memorability to the plot. They make the humorous scenes funny, yet nothing too extreme to overshadow the dramatic elements of the movie, and the emotional connection they have for each other is extremely touching and authentic. This is shown when the strong and supportive Robin Williams holds the trembling, sobbing Matt Damon like a son as Sean reassures Will that nothing was his fault. They also depict scenes of anger due to pain well, without holding back on emotional/vulgar language and violent actions. Each scene is believable and is never forced, due to these characters' impeccable ability to let emotion overtake them. \n\tThe strength of the acting performance only enhances the engaging script. The script is well organized with an original story line that takes its own refreshing spin on the bad boy turned good story that is truly captivating. With the development of each character, the backstory, the memorable quotes such as \"bad times, will wake you up to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to,\" and the depth to each character's background and emotional state are reasons why Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve high praise as the writers.",

It's one of those movies that you just need to have watched some time in your life or you'd be a fool. Missing this movie is like missing a huge part of the film-making culture of Cinema and the 90's in general.\n\nThis is also the movie where Ben Affleck & Matt Damon really make their mark and jump on the A-list scene of actors and writers, granted Damon more as an actor and Affleck more as a writer. \n\nStorywise, the movie may be predictable, but somehow not in a bad way. Yes, you kind of know the ending from the first 10 minutes, but I believe that's how it was intended to be. Actually it's the key message of the film, that the end is not important, but instead the journey. It's not so much the general story arc that is interesting in this film but instead the interactions between the deeply developed characters and their relationships.\n\nDirection is excellent from Gus Van Sant, and he had a lot to work with given the excellent acting and greatly written story. Music and production quality are good but not incredible, given this is meant to be a down to earth story-driven film.\n\nActing performances are incredible from the entire cast, although one would need to be insane not to specifically mention Matt Damon in lead and Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver in supporting roles. Williams and Damon put forward Oscar worthy roles and have some performances that are incredibly emotional. Their chemistry as well as the matchup of Damon - Driver and Skarsgard - Williams are something to pay close attention to while watching.\n\nAll in all, How do ya like dem apples? Quite a bit!

Good Will Hunting won two Oscars when it came out and one of those was for Best Original Screenplay and it certainly deserved it. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are two incredible actors but they also deserve to be recognized as two incredible writers because their script for Good Will Hunting is just fascinating. Good Will Hunting's story felt fresh and I loved that about this movie, nowadays you rarely get movies like Good Will Hunting, movies with a well thought our story and characters that you actually care about. I thought that Damon and Affleck did a great job at balancing out the tone of the film because there is a mix of drama and comedy, mainly drama but there is sill a good amount of humor. Another thing I love about this movie is that it has heart, you actually care about what is happening on screen and about the characters in the film. The dialogue in this film is just brilliantly written because it feels so real; when you hear these four friends speak it feels real, when two or more characters are having this deep and dramatic conversation it feels real. Everything in this script is just amazing in my eyes; the story is great, the drama is hard-hitting, the humor works, the dialogue is brilliant, and the characters were well thought out. The only complaint I have is very minor and that is a little pacing issue at some point of the film, which could be the directors fault, but other than that everything was marvelous. Director Gus Van Sant does an astonishing job directing Damon's and Affleck's script, he does a very good job at setting up the shots and adding some intensity to the heavy scenes along with directing the actors. Cinematographer Jean-Yves Escoffier does a spectacular job at capturing the look of the movie and Danny Elfman's score was pure brilliance and fit the film perfectly. The performances in this movie are just extraordinary, there is not one weak link in this cast. This is the movie that put Matt Damon on the map and he gives one of the best performances of his career in this one. He just becomes this character because he knows the character since he wrote him and his chemistry with all the other actors are flawless. Robin Williams gives a fantastic performance and deserved the win that year for Best Supporting Actor, he gives such a powerful performance and every time he and Damon are on screen it's just magic. The rest of the supporting cast is also great which includes Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsgard, Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser. In the end Good Will Hunting is a terrific film and is filmmaking at it's best, definitely check this one out if you haven't already seen it.",

Whenever a new blockbuster movie comes out, the creators think it is absolutely necessary to add in some humor, when it is not really needed. This is what's primarily wrong with Iron Man 3.

It's funny how 18 years can change your opinion about a movie. I was lukewarm to the film back then, but now - 18 years wiser - I see it in a new light.\n\nI had initially dismissed this film as a two hour study of a bunch of unlikeable and unbelievable people. But now it is evident that Matt Damon deserved his Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the title character, the good Will Hunting.\n\nDamon does a yeoman's job making us believe in someone who is not only a math genius with a photographic memory, but a barroom-brawler, cynic, janitor, lover, and all-around down-to-earth working-class joe. Damon and his compadre Ben Affleck also deserved their Oscar screenplay win for creating a character more fantastic than any from the mind of J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nRobin Williams also deserved his Oscar win for having us buy his interpretation of an all-knowing beard-sporting eye-glinting joke-cracking-but-no-nonsense psychologist. \n\nAffleck, director Gus Van Sant, and the rest of the cast merit mention as well for trying to get us to like and accept all the unappealing and implausible characters who populate this fantasy world.\n\nAll this leads me to believe that I should revisit films like Showgirls, The River Wild, Devine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, and The Greek Tycoon. Maybe I was a little too harsh in my initial assessment of those as well. \n\nYeah, right.",

And that just needs help not only to show it to the world, but for himself, and at the same time helping those around you, but this is a short summary of what this Masterpiece has to give.\nMatt Damon it is superb, and it grabs his character (which he wrote) so impressive and credible; Robin Williams in one of his best roles, his character is the most beloved and fun (and a little perturbed), the entire cast does a phenomenal job, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Minnie Driver, Ben Affleck, all perfect.\nThe film teaches us that we all have a soul mate, not a romantic, but one that challenges us and transforms us what we are in the future ... (I wish have bolth). A film very well done, very well written, we laugh, we cry, we learn, we see things in a differently way. And for all who feel alone in their lives, I just say ... \"It's not your fault!\"",

And some of the personal drama Will Hunting goes through as his sarcastic front is broken down by the two adults and an ambitious Harvard student played by Minnie Driver is also well-played, emotionally fruitful, and somewhat moving.

Good Will Hunting is directed with care, written intelligently (showing potential for the other films Affleck would go on to make), and acted incredibly. Some of the best scenes are no cut monologues in which the actors give some of the most outstanding performances I've ever seen. Will Hunting is a talented but troubled character who needs to get on his feet, not only for himself, but for the sake of his burnt out friends and desperate professor. He is constantly fighting himself and others because of the decisions he is forced to make, allowing the audience to feel his pain with every word. There is a realness to Damon's chemistry with Williams, Driver, and Affleck that cannot be forced or practiced, and this is probably some of the best work done by any of these actors.",

            "content": "Well what can I see about this picture; other than it is actually stunning and deeply inspiring. Not stunning in the superficial sense, but a picture that really questions ones current situation and meaning in this world. I recently watched this movie and was concerned that I wasn't going to enjoy the move because of preconceived notions I had about the movie, knowing that it is widely and critically claimed - both for its acting and resonating message. I was wrong and this movie totally blew me away.\r\n\r\nWill Hunting (played by Matt Damon in his Oscar-nominated role) is an extremely bright Maths genius at one of the world's most prestigious universities - no, not as a student - as one of its janitors and whose situation is not and its most ideal in life. Plagued by deep personal problems, Hunting is forced to confide in therapy to aid his plight by the highly acclaimed Professor of Psychology Sean Maguire (portrayed by Robin Williams in his Academy Award-winning performance for this picture). Although initially apprehensive about confiding in a profession Hunting fails to appreciate - big earners - the two's friendship blossoms into the very message this picture is trying to encourage - follow your dreams but never forget who your friends are. \r\n\r\nThe film's writing is also of genius - striking a comedic and dramatic balance in what is meant to be a deeply touching picture. Those in the supporting roles of the movie (Affleck, Driver and Williams) were also positive highlights in demonstrating how varied our lives can be in terms of who we are acquainted with. We all know someone like Will Hunting - a bright guy whose direction in life is way of course, someone like Chuckie whose persistent irritancies aims to encourage us to fulfill our life to the fullest and of course Driver's character - a crush that decides to move away forever. Damon and Affleck penned this magnificent piece of art won, to date, their only Academy Award - for Best Original Screenplay - is a thoroughly decide accolade that will stand the test of time to be forgotten. \r\n\r\nWords cannot bespeak the brilliance of this movie, currently ranked as one of my favorites of all time. The true success with this movie is how relatable the plot is to our lives and how Hunting's story of pain and happiness can help us to aspire to be more than just money-grabbing robots.",

            "content": "One of the most important things a person should know is that everyone is different and we all have our own life story. Sometimes, a person with certain skills and talents comes from the last place we think we'd find them. In the case of the main title character in Gus Van Sant's 1997 drama Good Will Hunting, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a gifted mathematician even though he's only a janitor at MIT. Although a mathematics teacher (Stellan Skarsgard) on campus recognizes his impressive skills, Will doesn't seem to be interested in pursuing a future as a student and would rather hang out with his pals (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser) instead. \n\nThis all changes however when he gets into a fight with someone who bullied him as a kid and faces the possibility of going to jail as a result of his actions. When the teacher gets wind of this incident, he offers to bail Will out under two conditions: 1) he studies mathematics under his supervision, and 2) he sees a therapist regularly. Although Will agrees to this deal, he isn't thrilled with the idea of seeing a therapist and doesn't take his first few therapists seriously. \n\nBut when the teacher is able to hire his former college roommate (Robin Williams) to give a shot at getting through to Will, Will eventually starts to open up about his past and his current relationship with a British student (Minnie Driver) at MIT. Through their therapy sessions, they start to learn more about one another and realize that they both share important things in common. \n\nGood Will Hunting is an inspiring, if not particularly surprising, tale about learning to plan for the road ahead and figuring out where you want to go in life with committed performances from the entire cast, and a script by co-stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck with a handful of enjoyable moments. Good Will Hunting is also a well crafted character study about a young man who has the potential as proved through his math skills, but just doesn't have the direction towards where he wants to go in life. In a way, all the people that Will comes across are all there to help him. Between his girlfriend, his friends, the therapist and the teacher, they all shape him in more ways than one. \n\nThe first two-thirds of the film are very well done and naturally play out with the chemistry between Damon and Driver as well as the relationships Damon has with everybody. Then comes the last third of the movie which relies too heavily on the formula most other movies follow, with the love interest possibly leaving town and the main character experiencing some sort of downfall in which everyone in the audience then knows what will happen next and how everything will be resolved in the end. \n\nI've always disliked it when a film resorts to very clich\u00e9d plot devices like this since it takes away the natural authenticity the film had before that point, and since it feels too safe to the point where even the slightest bit of creativity is discouraged due to an excessive fear of failure on the filmmaker's part. In particular, it doesn't work in the last third of this movie, since they don't give us a good enough reason why these events need to happen in the first place, it just feels really forced and heavy-handed. \n\nOther than that \"normal\" plot flaw with the film's last third and a few brief slow spots, I liked what Good Will Hunting had to offer. I thought its message regarding the importance of figuring out your life goals and dreams is a good moral to reinforce to teenagers and young adults. Although there is a generous amount of profanity in the film, the dialogue and the situations the characters undergo were well thought through by writers/stars Damon and Affleck. \n\nEven despite its predictability, the story that was being told had a certain originality to it and the characters were fairly engaging enough to make the drama in the story stimulating. As long as you don't expect too many surprises, with the exception of one or two, there's enough substance in Good Will Hunting that makes it worth checking out.",

I highly recommend this movie. Here you have a 90s classic wich is simple but powerful. This movie defines many things with its dialogue and not only and that's why I loved it. Sow, what I can tell about Good Will Hunting is that is a masterpiece with a masterpiece title, the acting was superb, so as the writing, the soundtrack and the directing, this is a kind of movie that we don't get to see every day, and when we get to see it, we can't lose that oppurtinity, because this is pure cinema. You haven't watched Good Will Hunting because you thought it sucked? Go hunt good will. Overall, Good Will Hunting is a tremendous film, I'm glad it had amazing reviews and I'm glad it  has an 8.1 on IMDb and it's on IMDb's Top 250 List on #179, I'm also glad it won 2 Oscars and it was nominated for some other oscars. Good Will Hunting is without doubts a must see and one of my favorite movies. Fantastic movie.\n\nGus Van Sant directed it and he did a pretty good job and I think he deserved his Oscar-nomination for his great work. Matt Damon was fantastic, he was like 17 years old and he was just terrific and although he didn't won his Oscar, I think he deserved to get his nomination by his amazing work playing a troubled kid, Matt is known from The Departed, The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum, True Grit, The Adjustment Bureau and some other movies. Robin Williams was terrific, he was just excellent and I completely loved his performance as a guy who knows lots of things and every time he opens his mouth he says something true and amazing, I think he was just excellent and I have no second thoughts about him getting an oscar for this marvelous performance, wich was probably the best performance of his whole career, Robin is known from Mrs. Doubtfire, Aladdin and some other movies. Ben Affleck was great here, I liked his performance alot, Ben is known from The Town, Pearl Harbor, Daredevil and some other movies. Stelan Skarsg\u00e5rd was okay, I liked his performance, Stellan is known from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Thor, Mamma Mia! and some other movies. Minnie Driver was great  here, she joined the movie a solid performance that was worth of a deserved Oscar-nomination, Minnie is known from Grosse Point Blank, Tarzan, Barney's Version, Motherhood and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie has a fantastic cast and fantastic performances, but the one thing that really stands out is Robin's and Matt's fantastic chemistry. Fantastic cast.\n\nWill Hunting (Matt Damon) is a janitor that works at MIT. He seems to have a gift to solve mathematic problems, but now he has to see the psyhcologist Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) to find a direction in his life. But, what is really going to give him a better direction in his life is Skylar (Minnie Driver), his soul mate. Some people can never believe in themselves, until someone believes in them.(What I thought about the plot) The script was pure genius, it was amazingly written by Matt and Ben and they both deserved their Oscar, because this script is just genius, it's clever and heartwarming. They created many fantastic characters, like Will Hunting (Matt), a young jenitor that turns out to be a Math genius. I also loved the Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), it was a very interesting character about a middle-aged guy who has a troubled past but he's now going to find his new direction. Sow, I loved the characters and I loved the plot, the plot was amazingly written and I think it couldn't get away without getting an Oscar. Fantastic plot.\n\nSoundtrack, well, the soundtrack was great. The soundtrack was composed by Danny Elfman and he did a great job, he composed very well a dramatic score wich was worth of an Oscar-nomination. The original song by Elliot Smith, \"Miss Misery\", also gave this movie another Oscar-nomination. Sow, as you can see, 2 of this movie's Oscar-nominations were for its soundtrack, wich means that this movie has an amazing soundtrack.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, I think this should be watched by everyone, Good Will Hunting is an extraordinary movie with a great mix of drama and humor, mostly because of Robin. Overall, Good Will Hunting has found its good will right at the beginning of it, it's a movie that leaves you happy, makes you rarely laugh, but everytime rare time you laugh is great and it's a very well made movie about finding yourself, it has a fantastic cast, fantastic performances, a fantastic plot, a fantastic storyline, it's highly entertaining and I highly recommend it. This movie will always be a memorable classic that's not just a movie, it's much more than that. Highlight: Matt next to Robin; Plot, etc. Worst: Nothing. Sow, watch Good Will Hunting if you haven't, you'll be entertained you'll have your heart warmed mostly by the actors on the screen. Good Will Hunting: 10/10. Terrific.\n\nTerrific movie. Extremely recommended movie, 100% recommended movie. Grade: A+.",

            "content": "Gus Van Sant's \"Good Will Hunting\" is an example of an age-old movie truism: audience's won't mind hearing a cover song if it's played this well. Following a script co-written by its then-budding star duo Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the story introduces Will Hunting (Damon) as a troubled math prodigy who, after a few too many run-ins with the law, cuts a deal with an MIT professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) that involves him seeing a therapist, an idea Will rejects until he meets Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), a former colleague of Lambeau's who has a few skeletons in his own closet. The script on its own is emotionally resonant, but what catapults this movie even higher are the performances. Both Damon and Affleck are solid, and Minnie Driver is also effective as Will's love interest. That being said, as is the case with most movies he's cast in, this ends up being the Robin Williams show, but for an entirely different reason. He trades in his manic comedy persona for a subdued, intense performance as a down-and-out former wunderkid that stands the test of time. It also rightly won him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. A satisfying drama on all counts - see it.",

These are ably supported by the likes of Minnie Driver and Stellen Skarsgard who also put in great supporting roles.\nAs i said earlier the one thing that stays with you after watching it is the power of the film, this is from the performances and from the story itself.

            "content": "I'm going to start off saying, 1998 will forever be the year that Good Will Hunting got robbed from its academy award by Titanic, after watching this film again it just further reminded me of it.  While the story arc can at times seem a little predictable it does it so dang well and the script deals with the story so well that even though this kind of inspirational arc has been done before it never strays from being engaging and brilliant.  \n\nGood Will Hunting follows Will Hunting (as played by Matt Damon) who is a janitor at MIT as well as working a construction job, the kid has an extreme gift for learning and academics that he is seen to be a wasted potential.  After getting into a fight and almost having to serve time Prof. Lambeau bails him out, after discovering he solved one of his theorems, on the condition that he does math for him and take therapy.  Although Matt Damon is very reluctant (for most the movie) about the therapy given by Sean Maguire (played brilliantly by Robin Williams) he goes through with it, if only to avoid being put back in jail.  By just giving the general gist of the storyline it seems like a fairly predictable inspirational story, and in some ways you could see it like that, but then you would be missing so much of the brilliance of it.  The movie (penned brilliantly by Damon and Affleck) takes a very simple story and premise and creates so many fantastic moments and scenes that all play out so well (it also helps that every actor in the movie gives a spot-on performance, especially in Damon and Williams' case, the two of them were extraordinarily moving in their scenes together and worked very well off of each other).  Honestly, I do not think you can watch Good Will Hunting and not have the script and performances make you feel something, they are just that well done.\n\nAnother thing in Good Will Hunting's favor is that it is a two hour long movie and it keeps you engaged for the entire two hours.  This is a spectacular feat in that most movies that are over 2 hours in length have a hard time keeping you engaged for the entire two hours (or longer), they almost always have a part where you may lose focus or drift off for a second, Good Will Hunting never has that moment where it loses your attention, once it grabs it your attention belongs to the film until the credits start rolling.  I have to think that the only explanation for how it is able to accomplish this is that every element of the film works and keeps you engaged, the direction is great, the screenplay fantastic, the performances are phenomenal, the ensemble and chemistry is also so good you can't really point out a weak link where you are like, \"That's the guy, that's the one thing that's wrong with the movie.\"  That is because unlike a lot of movies, every character has their purpose, all the characters are well developed, even the minor ones, and all the actors play their roles (even the minor ones) to the standard as if they were the lead of the film, there is no actor who slacks off and gives a lousy performance.  And again, this is most likely due to the fact because everything else worked and so the acting fell into place as well.\n\nOn a more technical note, the soundtrack does a very good job at keeping the mood of the film, sure it's not the most groundbreaking soundtrack ever, but it does its purpose and it does its purpose well.  The cinematography is also done well, and yes there isn't anything groundbreaking but there isn't many groundbreaking shots you can take with a film like this, however there are many nice pictures made and it is also done well that there can't be a complaint about it.\n\nI will give my one small gripe about this film however, and it is very (very) nit-picky, it is that I would have ended the film at *SPOILER* the character Affleck plays (Chuckie) leaving to find that Damon had left and Robin Williams picking up the letter.  I honestly didn't need to hear the letter, it should have left it ambiguous and even ending with the same car driving except with a cut on what the actual letter said (Robin Williams could have even said, \"He stole my line\", out loud after reading it).  I think leaving a little ambiguity would have made the ending more interesting where the viewer can pretty much assume where Damon is going to go but it isn't told to them, just one more little piece for the viewer to link themselves is good, it makes it more interesting.  But again, that was very nit-picky and isn't really a flaw in the movie.\n\nOverall, Good Will Hunting is another classic that the 90s produced that sadly got overshadowed by the good but less deserving Titanic (similarly how Shawshank and Pulp got overshadowed by Forrest Gump, although I like Gump a lot better than Titanic (although it didn't deserve the oscar over shawshank or Pulp Fiction) and Pulp and Shawshank have larger followings than Good Will Hunting has today).  Bolstered by powerful performances by Damon and Williams as well as a moving script and excellent direction, Good Will Hunting is a rare film that gets everything right, and one of my personal favorites that came from the 90s era.  10/10 for Good Will Hunting.",

Add to that a persistent beat of TV-math brilliance and wave after wave of Zinn & Chomsky perverted into I-know-better-than-you cliche one-liners used against characters that are caricatures of our main characters (just like the people you identify with, only a bit less \"real\" and a bit more a-hole, because they haven't had it rough enough) and you've got yourself a clusterf*** ready to take you exactly nowhere.And taking you nowhere - that it delivers. The message here is that you should leave the group that supports you the most because they really want you to be the best nihilist you can be, then join the system against your better judgment, because you really want to do that cute co-ed sporting a thick british accent and almost as \"real\" a personality as yours. It's a bit of a 90% truth-10% bs situation, where the story gets you to believe the message and the message then directs you to oblivion of isolation and despair, where personal integrity takes a back seat to coping. It offers the intelectually dead induvidualist a way to sink into the pleasant stupor of the-best-you-can-do confusion, as a civilisation dies around him.",

Some of his, improvised nonetheless, scenes are breathtakingly believable and heartfelt. \n\nAt a budget of $10 million however, Good Will Hunting was never quite the visual tour de force. Especially in light of more contemporary films that showcased the Ivy League schools as set pieces, Good Will Hunting falls somewhat flat. It has to be stated however that this does not compromise the integrity of the movie in any way whatsoever. \n\nGood Will Huntings fifteenth anniversary fast approaching make a fitting excuse to revisit, in my opinion, one of the many highlights that is late 90's cinema.",

Matt Damon and Robin Williams flow together extremely well on-screen, not as if they were just two actors working together, but like two characters with extraordinary depth and development. Damon and Driver have a great romantic chemistry. Gus Van Sant enlisted himself among the ranks of my generation's great directors. I love how Ben and Matt write such a brotherly relationship between all of the friends, ironically primarily in the case of Ben and Casey who use their relationship as brothers in real life to propel the characters and help the viewer understand who they are in the group and what they mean to the story. Matt Damon's amazing star-making performance. Better than his other performances in some of his other truly amazing films even the likes of \"The Bourne Identity\" and \"The Departed.\" I always love it when actors get to use their true accents in their films. I was also very impressed with the writing skill from Ben and Matt with them having been such young stars. A real cinematic gem that ceases to lose it's luster and dramatic efficiency!",

The paradox resulting is that for science people pushing them towards becomgint he best, how come they would if such guys exist? and they do exist.

            "content": "There's something remarkably wonderful about this movie, I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's the fact that Matt Damon looks like he's 16 in this movie? Maybe it's that Robin Williams is not desperately trying to be funny in this movie? Maybe it's that the script is highly sophisticated and deep yet it was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck when they were in college? Maybe it's that it doesn't try to be something special, but at the same time it is? Maybe it's all the captivating moments with no dialogue. Rather, the mood is set by silence or the subtle ambience of a pretty park by a pond in the summertime. This is all speculation, of course, but Good Will Hunting just gives you a really good feeling when you're done watching it. The format that Good Will Hunting follows is nothing I haven't seen before, but the drama is just so dramtic, the comedy is just so hillarious, the sad moments are incredibly depressing, and the uplifting moments are incredibly moving. It's a feel-good movie that's very deep, a rare species. Robin Williams and Matt Damon are simply perfect in this movie, Damon playing a troubled kid with a bleak past and Williams playing a weathered man who has been-around-the-block a few times and truly wants to help people. The characters that Damon and Williams play are unlike most characters that the actors would usually play. For example, Williams plays a relaxed and inspiring man who is always happy and sad at the same time. Usually his characters are over-the-top comic roles who try desperately to get a laugh from the audience. Damon's characters are usually strong and laid-back, while Damon's character here is an unstable person who can't control his emotions. All in all, you can't really go wrong with Good Will Hunting. While it's certainly not a perfect movie, there isn't much to dislike and in the end you feel like you just have to smile.",

The plot was very deep and uplifting, and it's one of those films where it makes you feel good about yourself. The characters are easy to relate to, and every one of them are well done by talented cast. Robin Williams usually gets into funny movies, but I was surprised about how he can pull a drama movie pretty well.

            "content": "Without doubts Good Will Hunting is a 5 out of 5 for its excellent performances by Damon and Williams, by its genius script and by the amazing dialogue and touchy feeling moments. I highly recommend this movie. Here you have a 90s classic wich is simple but powerful. This movie defines many things with its dialogue and not only and that's why I loved it. Sow, what I can tell about Good Will Hunting is that is a masterpiece with a masterpiece title, the acting was superb, so as the writing, the soundtrack and the directing, this is a kind of movie that we don't get to see every day, and when we get to see it, we can't lose that oppurtinity, because this is pure cinema. You haven't watched Good Will Hunting because you thought it sucked? Go hunt good will. Overall, Good Will Hunting is a tremendous film, I'm glad it had amazing reviews and I'm glad it  has an 8.1 on IMDb and it's on IMDb's Top 250 List on #179, I'm also glad it won 2 Oscars and it was nominated for some other oscars. Good Will Hunting is without doubts a must see and one of my favorite movies. Fantastic movie.\n\nGus Van Sant directed it and he did a pretty good job and I think he deserved his Oscar-nomination for his great work. Matt Damon was fantastic, he was like 17 years old and he was just terrific and although he didn't won his Oscar, I think he deserved to get his nomination by his amazing work playing a troubled kid, Matt is known from The Departed, The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum, True Grit, The Adjustment Bureau and some other movies. Robin Williams was terrific, he was just excellent and I completely loved his performance as a guy who knows lots of things and every time he opens his mouth he says something true and amazing, I think he was just excellent and I have no second thoughts about him getting an oscar for this marvelous performance, wich was probably the best performance of his whole career, Robin is known from Mrs. Doubtfire, Aladdin and some other movies. Ben Affleck was great here, I liked his performance alot, Ben is known from The Town, Pearl Harbor, Daredevil and some other movies. Stelan Skarsg\u00e5rd was okay, I liked his performance, Stellan is known from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Thor, Mamma Mia! and some other movies. Minnie Driver was great  here, she joined the movie a solid performance that was worth of a deserved Oscar-nomination, Minnie is known from Grosse Point Blank, Tarzan, Barney's Version, Motherhood and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie has a fantastic cast and fantastic performances, but the one thing that really stands out is Robin's and Matt's fantastic chemistry. Fantastic cast.\n\nWill Hunting (Matt Damon) is a janitor that works at MIT. He seems to have a gift to solve mathematic problems, but now he has to see the psyhcologist Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) to find a direction in his life. But, what is really going to give him a better direction in his life is Skylar (Minnie Driver), his soul mate. Some people can never believe in themselves, until someone believes in them.(What I thought about the plot) The script was pure genius, it was amazingly written by Matt and Ben and they both deserved their Oscar, because this script is just genius, it's clever and heartwarming. They created many fantastic characters, like Will Hunting (Matt), a young jenitor that turns out to be a Math genius. I also loved the Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), it was a very interesting character about a middle-aged guy who has a troubled past but he's now going to find his new direction. Sow, I loved the characters and I loved the plot, the plot was amazingly written and I think it couldn't get away without getting an Oscar. Fantastic plot.\n\nSoundtrack, well, the soundtrack was great. The soundtrack was composed by Danny Elfman and he did a great job, he composed very well a dramatic score wich was worth of an Oscar-nomination. The original song by Elliot Smith, \"Miss Misery\", also gave this movie another Oscar-nomination. Sow, as you can see, 2 of this movie's Oscar-nominations were for its soundtrack, wich means that this movie has an amazing soundtrack.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, I think this should be watched by everyone, Good Will Hunting is an extraordinary movie with a great mix of drama and humor, mostly because of Robin. Overall, Good Will Hunting has found its good will right at the beginning of it, it's a movie that leaves you happy, makes you rarely laugh, but everytime rare time you laugh is great and it's a very well made movie about finding yourself, it has a fantastic cast, fantastic performances, a fantastic plot, a fantastic storyline, it's highly entertaining and I highly recommend it. This movie will always be a memorable classic that's not just a movie, it's much more than that. Highlight: Matt next to Robin; Plot, etc. Worst: Nothing. Sow, watch Good Will Hunting if you haven't, you'll be entertained you'll have your heart warmed mostly by the actors on the screen. Good Will Hunting: 10/10. Terrific.\n\nTerrific movie. Extremely recommended movie, 100% recommended movie. Grade: A+.",

            "content": "It may seem generic and underwhelming on the outside but this movie packs a heap more than we originally believe.\n\n'Good Will Hunting' is directed by Gus Van Sant and stars Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck,  Stellan Skarsgard, Minnie Driver and Casey Affleck.\n\n'Good Will Hunting' is about a young, genius boy named Will(Matt Damon) from South Boston. He works as a janitor and he has a photographic memory. His gift allows him to excel in the field of mathematics but chooses to live a life drinking with his friends and not fulfilling his life's potential.\nWith his life slowly crashing and burning he gets help from a university professor and a psychiatrist to rebuild his life and solve the problems from his past and focus on his future.\n\nThis is a warm hearted movie, it may not seem like it initially as we're introduced to an intimidating Will Hunting but the movie sets it up and executes his motives quite effectively. \nThe group of friends he hangs out with is a lot of fun. Their constant jokes and mocking of each other cracks me up and makes me wish I have friends as awesome as they are. We are welcomed to their group and it is established who is the smart one, the dumb one, the best mate, you get it and it just wants me be involved so much.\nSeeing Robin Williams here is interesting. Just like in my recent review of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and seeing Jim Carrey play in a drama proved to be achieved in a believable and compelling way. The same goes for Williams. Both actors were famous for their outrageous comedic personalities and performances and now having them appear in dramas shakes my head in amazement. \nBack to William's character, he was solid, charismatic and likeable. He reminds me of the cuddly uncle I never had. The one who would give advice about life and share stories to his grandchildren, William's portrayed him very well.\n\nWhat sets the bar quite high here is the script and connection we have between all the characters. The dialogue is written so well with some perfect one liners, jokes and memorable quotes. Conversations aren't at all convenient and by that I mean written in a corny way or sappy fashion. Break up, conflict and social scenes are so natural and doesn't make it feel fake at any point.\n\n'Good Will Hunting' is a spectacular movie. It definitely fed me inspiration in a way a regular personal development speaker would not be able to. No surprise it won some Oscars. \nChances are after you see this it'll be part of your long term movie collection.",

Matt Damon's strongest performance to date, well deserved of the Oscar nod. Robin Williams, again, shows us that he's more than a comedic performer. He delivers here and is worthy of the Oscar. Also, Ben and Casey Affleck give strong supporting performances. The performance that really did it for for though was that of Minnie Driver. She owned every second and demanded that her character be noticed. One of the strongest supporting perfomances I have ever seen. She truly was absolutely fantastic in this film and was WELL deserving of an Oscar nom.\r\nYou absolutely cannot miss this film. It's got it all. A strong, brilliant, touching, well-rounded film!",

So...\n\n It really is one of the best films of our lifetime (thus far), and is a true testament to the talent of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (who both were only in their early twenties when they made this!).\n\nFor much of the film, the vibe is gritty and troubled, and it puts a lump in your throat. But the overall message and narrative of the film is one of hope, introspection, and the simplicity of what defines happiness. It's a must see for anyone who hasn't already seen it. It's a true classic.\n\nADDENDUM: It would be remiss of me to not also mention Robin Williams's performance in this film. Too often he is typecast as a one-trick pony (admittedly, oftentimes, by myself). This film serves as proof-positive that he's a true artist, and is a very gifted actor. Couple this with other films of his, like that of \"The Night Listener\" (I don't care what anyone says -- I liked that movie), and his talent for the art of acting becomes undeniable.",

There are several life-changing moments for the characters, and several revelations about what certain characters mean to each other that you don't expect; every single one of them you go through the transition with. It's almost trying to teach you everything there is that's important in life, and regardless of whether you knew it before it will make you feel like it's fresh.\n\nA powerhouse of performances is the films second ingredient of brilliance. Robin Williams, in a role he developed and re-worked himself puts in the performance of his career. Therapist Sean McGuire is the man tasked with helping delve into the psyche of Matt Damon's Will Hunting, and Williams does it with the lightest and subtlest touches. It's a masterpiece of a role, and seeing how some of McGuire's best moments were ad-libbed, it's tribute to exactly how much Williams understood this character that makes the Oscar he received more than deserved.\n\nMatt Damon is also exceptional, finding the shades of grey needed for Will Hunting, then allowing them to be broken down piece by piece as more and more of his life is uncovered. The pair are not alone though as the supporting cast are equally strong. Affleck shines through as Hunting's friend Chuckie, particularly in a surprisingly touching number of scenes in the films final act. Minnie Driver wins over you heart as Skylar, and even though her character isn't given the screen time you want to wrap up her character arc it somehow isn't needed. \n\nThrough and throughout, Good Will Hunting will put a smile on your face, and you'll never be more happy to watch the entire credits in the hope that there is just a tiny bit more insight into the world of these perfectly crafted characters. \n\nAs close to cinema perfection as there is.",

So young will is given a free pass on the condition he work with the Professor and see a therapist, but the only therapist that has a chance of getting close to the hard edged and guarded genius is Dr. Lambeau's old college roommate Sean McGuire (Robin Williams).\nThis is a solid plot with great acting and very good character development about this young genius who has to face some painful memories from his dark past if he wants any chance of breaking free from his suffocating and dead end lifestyle.

            "content": "Harvard doesn't so much seem to be a university as it does a fictional land of ethereal genius.  I imagine its student body sexy like the misanthropes of \"Cruel Intentions,\" uniformed like the young wizards of Hogwarts, adept in the art of conversation like any character in a given Aaron Sorkin penned TV series.  A friend of mine goes there, being the basketball playing Emmy Noether of our middle-of-the-road home town, and confounding is the way those around her unanimously display uncharted characteristics of brilliance.  Missing are the students unsure of where their future might take them - with most loaded with cash and otherworldly brain function, the world is an oyster encrusted with a monolith of a pearl.  They could be a doctor or a chemist or a lawyer or an engineer, no what-ifs implemented within the scenery.  Part of me would love to meet them with an eye-roll and an edged-out scoff, but another, too undoubtedly impressed, would be too in awe to put forth such disdain.  How nice it would be to be boundless in everything you do.\n\tBut imagine if the person embodying such versatility had no drive, and had no plans to utilize their cerebral capability, preferring custodial work to achieving a degree.  You wouldn't want to stand alongside them and let them throw away their unfathomable aptitude - you'd want to knock some sense into them, turning their apathy into ambition and getting them out of their standstill of a current life.  \t\n\tOne such unmotivated figurehead is \"Good Will Hunting's\" titular protagonist (portrayed by Matt Damon), a twenty-year-old slacker who holds great intellectual ability (he has eidetic memory) but isn't much inclined to harness it.  As a perpetual idler who spends his days drinking with his immature set of buddies, he works as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology rather than an attendee, to the annoyance of us and his friends that know he's worthy of something greater.  But Will won't have it - he has no goals in sight, and figures he'd be perfectly happy doing handiwork until retirement becomes him.  Bully for him when he daftly solves a challenge problem posted by one of the math professors; his competency doesn't go unnoticed, and from there does his journey into self-actualization begin.\n\tIt's all a matter of coincidence, really.  As the institute attempts to figure out who finished the problem, Will flees the scene, worried that he will no longer be able to survive on his minimum-wage life because adult figures might force him to do something more meaningful with his life.  So when he later assaults a childhood foe and the police officer who tries to make peace, he faces arrest, but is able to skirt past it when Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), the man who posted the math problem, proposes that he privately study the field with him while also attending regular therapy instead.  As learning and divulging one's problems is more appetizing than spending a couple months in a jail cell, Will agrees, much to his disliking.\n\tBut, of course, such activities prompt him to realize that he can't keep going on the path that he has been for the rest of his existence.  He likes to drunkenly mess around with his friends, but he might like Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British Harvard student he begins romancing, better.  He likes to tell himself that hammering drywall is a more valid job than solving mathematical proofs, but he might think otherwise the more he sees Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), the psychologist he's expected to talk with that eventually becomes a sort of confidant.  The film's events just might be the most emotional and confusing of Will Hunting's life - but he'd better get the girl and better stop slacking off in the end.  He needs to.\n\tI have a theory, anyway, that a movie should be able to be predictable so long as we want a happy ending, and if we want its characters to prosper.  If emotional manipulation isn't a part of the equation, why not give us what we desire? \"Good Will Hunting,\" a smart crowdpleaser that undercuts its realism by warming the heart, earns its good-natured conclusion - it's the sort of film we could watch over and over again, its dialogue and acting so voracious and interesting that its feel-good twist is the very thing that keeps us coming back for more all these years later.\n\tPart of its charm, too, is its working as a breakthrough for so many of those involved.  It brought avant garde filmmaker Gus Van Sant his first worldwide success, and it propelled Damon and Ben Affleck to superstardom, winning them both Oscars for their screenplay as well as defining them as acting talents of weighty ability.  It brought Williams, poignant as Will's therapist, a trophy for his supporting turn, and got Driver, the most engrossing love interest of the decade, a nomination.  Because \"Good Will Hunting\" is a work that doesn't just make an impression; it also gallantly affects us, going beyond mere satisfying filmmaking because it touches us in ways few films can manage.  You might as well treat yourself to a viewing following the reading of this final sentence; it makes for a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours, and a little cinematic dopamine here and there can be a terrific thing.",

            "content": "Good Will Hunting is manipulative and spends a good half the film playing your emotions like a piano, but it is so effective that even while you know full well what it is trying to do you can't help but allow yourself to get involved.\r\n\r\nWill Hunting is a young tearaway floating aimlessly through life as his youth evaporates, yet unwilling to start making the grown up decisions. He spends most days with his three buddies hanging out, swearing, trashtalking, fighting and drinking, and his own personal time is spent janitoring and reading...\r\n\r\nHis friends are more the \"whadda you lookin' at?\" type, and it is during the fighting part of his day that Will inadvertently takes a swing at a local cop.\r\n\r\nWill does his janitorin' at a local college in Boston where a professor named Lambeaux (Stellen Skarsgaard) has posed a mathematical equation as a special challenge to his large group of students, he proposed that anyone who could solve this unbelievably complex problem would get a special prize and acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nWill came across the equation on a whiteboard when cleaning after hours and...\r\n\r\nShortly after Lambeaux realises the complex equation has been solved - and with no-one coming forward to claim credit for the feat - Lambeaux sets another, more complicated puzzle. He proclaims that while he doubts anyone will solve this one should they do so it will prove the first was no fluke.\r\n\r\nWill has a quick squiz and promptly puts the answer up on the board to something that took teams of mathematicians months to solve working in unison.\r\n\r\nBut Will doesn't want any attention or acclaim, when confronted about his acts he runs off to a night on the town with his friends once more. Will's buddies are simple hard working guys who also play hard, they tease each other unmercifully and seem resigned that this is how their lives will pan out forever. Meanwhile will gives a verbal beatdown to a pretentious egghead in the pub and simultaneously manages to pick up Skyla (Minnie Driver).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately thanks to punching the policeman Will is also thrown in prison to await sentencing for his assault. After Lambeaux manages to track him down he witnesses Will defending himself, citing obscure cases and verdicts as precedents and running verbal rings around the more experienced prosecutor.\r\n\r\nYep. Still smart.\r\n\r\nBut the judge ain't havin' it this time... and Will is sentenced to a stretch in the pen.\r\n\r\nTo fast forward a little Lambeaux manages to pull some strings and has Will released from prison on two conditions, the first that he spend some time with the maths team to see just how deep Will's intelligence and abilities go, the second that Will seek professional psychiatric help for his personal issues and anger management.\r\n\r\nWill agrees, but probably more because he wants to get a shot at Skyla.\r\n\r\nWill enjoys the maths side of the equation (get it?), but is far more reluctant to let someone into his head, he cuts a swathe through various shrinks, sidestepping real questions and disarming them with his superior intellect.\r\n\r\nEnter Shaun (Robin Williams) a long time friend of Lambeaux and basically the last chance at success. The initial meetings and chats are perfunctory exercises, at best silent at worst rocky and heated, but both Shaun and Will gradually realise that there is more to the other than meets the eye. Shaun feels that Will is incredibly gifted but a little na\u00efve and unsure of how to use his talents, but Will thinks that Shaun too is \"slumming it\" a little and taking the easy way out.\r\n\r\nAs the tenuous relationship grows more trusting and each comes to rely more on the other decisions must be made.\r\n\r\nLambeaux feels that Will is a once in a generation mind that could rival Einstein, he wants to \"discover\" him and unveil him to the world, Shaun only wants Will to think for himself and not merely recite what he knows from reading books and hearing others. More than anything though Will's buddies all know that he could be so much more than a janitor or construction worker, and while they bust their guts trying to get by they desperately want Will to use his natural talents to do something for himself.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while Skyla and her big head remain in Will's thoughts...\r\n\r\nGood Will Hunting has some excellent dialogue - so much so that it baffles me to think that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck came up with all this in their teens, even though Affleck has backed it up as a director - it is well paced, intelligent and always interesting. Near the end of the film the plot threatens briefly to get a little bit ahead of itself but the loose ends are all neatly pulled together for the conclusion, which while not being incredibly satisfying served to wrap things up nicely.\r\n\r\nRobin Williams is thankfully low key and realistic as Shaun, Matt Damon proved that he could act even then, and Skarsgaard has the unenviable role of being the bad guy, but he manages to show full justification for his desires.\r\n\r\nGood Will Hunting has become a bit of a punchline through the years, the \"How do you like them apples\" bit has been parodied, as has the success of the film in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (in a hilarious way too), but you can't ignore the impact that the film has when you watch it.\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 8.5 / 10. I remembered it more as a relic of the 90s, an anomaly that was inexplicably successful, rewatching it the other night showed me that it was worthy of the acclaim and the box office, like Will himself this is pretty exceptional.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 800 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

Matt Damon does an excellent job of playing a character with a million layers to his true personality and past, and as these layers are slowly stripped away throughout the movie, he becomes a freer person. Personally, I think this is Robin Williams best role. His monologue about Will knowing everything from books but his character actually experiencing life was honest and genuine, and even though it's delivered almost deadpan, you can just feel the emotion behind the words. Damon and Affleck did a good job of weaving the romance subplot into Will's overall story, without letting it distract from the overall story. In fact, it enhanced it. Story of love? Story of Redemption? Who knows. But, it's a great movie that if you haven't seen yet, watch it before the Oscars tonight :)",

More than a conversation, it is a monologue that Robin Williams delivers with incredible passion and it gives me goosebumps every time I watch this scene. It's the reason why he won an Academy Award for best supporting actor and why the film works as well as it does. This is just one fantastic moment, but I can think of many more scenes that left me completely in love with the movie. Like the scene where Sean Maguire and Stellan Skarsgard's Prof. Lambeau have their long awaited discussion about ego and missed opportunities (\"You think I'm a failure. I know who I am, and I'm proud of what I do. I was a conscientious choice, I didn't ef up! And you and your cronies think I'm some sort of pity case. You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around going, \"The Fields Medal! The Fields Medal!\" Why are you still so efin' afraid of failure?\"), the scene where Sean narrates Game 6 of the World Series to Will, which he passed on for the opportunity to meet his future wife (I just slid my ticket across the table, and I said, \"Sorry, guys; I gotta see about a girl.\"), and of course the final scene between Will And Sean which I don't want to spoil. There are just so many great moments in this film thanks to the strong performances and the amazing screenplay from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is one of my favorites. Even the scenes between Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and between Damon and Minnie Driver are incredible and I still have to leave them out of my top five favorite scenes in this movie because there are just so many. And I even left out Will's amazing monologue about why he shouldn't work for the N.S.A. It's simply one of the best written movies ever and it has Robin Williams best performance (that is saying a lot considering how much I loved his work in Dead Poet's Society, Good Morning Vietnam, and The Fisher King).            \n\n\"You're not perfect, sport, and let me save you the suspense: this girl you've met, she's not perfect either. But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other.\" \n\nI don't know if Good Will Hunting is a perfect film, but I know it is perfect for me and for that reason it will always be included as one of my all time favorite films up there with The Sixth Sense and The Dark Knight. I have plenty of other favorites which I sometimes include in my top ten, but those three are always at the very top of my list, and I don't even worry about having to discuss it with anyone else.",

Most of the visual was less imaginable, and more straight forward. Sound too. I'm writing this review a week after the viewing so it's pretty faded in my mind. I liked the development of Matt Damon's character.

The cast is great, a really well picked group of actors.  Matt Damons rage and genius made me really believe his performance, but the genius  is going to have to go to Robin Williams, who gives a speech to Will halfway through the movie that would not have been half as inspirational without Williams in the role.  Good Will Hunting is a film that makes us review our own lives and how we can push people away, it has many deep meanings and I can thank the genius of this film for that, I truly and honestly love this film.",

More than a conversation, it is a monologue that Robin Williams delivers with incredible passion and it gives me goosebumps every time I watch this scene. It's the reason why he won an Academy Award for best supporting actor and why the film works as well as it does. This is just one fantastic moment, but I can think of many more scenes that left me completely in love with the movie. Like the scene where Sean Maguire and Stellan Skarsgard's Prof. Lambeau have their long awaited discussion about ego and missed opportunities (\"You think I'm a failure. I know who I am, and I'm proud of what I do. I was a conscientious choice, I didn't ef up! And you and your cronies think I'm some sort of pity case. You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around going, \"The Fields Medal! The Fields Medal!\" Why are you still so efin' afraid of failure?\"), the scene where Sean narrates Game 6 of the World Series to Will, which he passed on for the opportunity to meet his future wife (I just slid my ticket across the table, and I said, \"Sorry, guys; I gotta see about a girl.\"), and of course the final scene between Will And Sean which I don't want to spoil. There are just so many great moments in this film thanks to the strong performances and the amazing screenplay from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is one of my favorites. Even the scenes between Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and between Damon and Minnie Driver are incredible and I still have to leave them out of my top five favorite scenes in this movie because there are just so many. And I even left out Will's amazing monologue about why he shouldn't work for the N.S.A. It's simply one of the best written movies ever and it has Robin Williams best performance (that is saying a lot considering how much I loved his work in Dead Poet's Society, Good Morning Vietnam, and The Fisher King).            \n\n\"You're not perfect, sport, and let me save you the suspense: this girl you've met, she's not perfect either. But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other.\" \n\nI don't know if Good Will Hunting is a perfect film, but I know it is perfect for me and for that reason it will always be included as one of my all time favorite films up there with The Sixth Sense and The Dark Knight. I have plenty of other favorites which I sometimes include in my top ten, but those three are always at the very top of my list, and I don't even worry about having to discuss it with anyone else.",

The sheer will and dedication he had but at the same time the recklessness and rage his character had was stunning. Robin Williams was also perfectly casted as Sean, Will's psychiatrist who helps him to overcome his outsider status, Sean shares similarities from how he grew up to Will. Ben Affleck's performance is also great he added some comic relief to the film but at the same time gave the best friend moral support to Will that he very much needed.  Minnie Driver plays the love interest for will and she did it with style and also helped touch upon the good side to the dangerous and reckless will. The film is just awesome, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's Oscar Winning screenplay is just pure brilliance and helps elevate the film even more.

            "content": "Although now Matt Damon is a bona fide superstar with an action trilogy and a heist trilogy both securely under his belt, there was a time when he wasn't so well known as to have his own marionette in Team America. With a few bit parts and a couple of supporting roles behind him, Damon had yet to make any sort of lasting mark on cinema. Ben Affleck, similarly, hadn't yet moved into the legitimate public eye, despite roles in Chasing Amy and Dazed and Confused. Then there was Good Will Hunting.\r\n\r\nThe story follows a South Boston construction worker with an unusual gift for mathematics. After he's discovered by an MIT professor and put under his supervision as a result of an assault charge, he's suddenly faced with a lot of important decisions.\r\n\r\nGus Van Sant's direction here is flawlessly old school. Long, lingering shots with minimalist camera work and just the right amount of emotion makes for some beautifully restrained work. Think David Fincher's work with the Social Network but with less cutting. The nature of the film demands a careful balance of humour and emotion and Van Sant never drops the ball. When it's supposed to be funny, you'll be laughing. When you're meant to be sad, there will be tears. Despite his often childlike apporach to the material, he is able to be unflinchingly mature in the moments that call for it. It's this versatility which is the mark of a great director that Van Sant displays so intuitively here.\r\n\r\nGood Will Hunting also features one of Danny Elfman's more diverse compositions, a bittersweet combination of keys and strings with a lilting pipe tune which stays with you for a while. It may verge on twee on the odd occassion but it's used with enough restraint that it doesn't become a crutch or substitute for real emotion. The real standout of the soundtrack is Elliott Smith's Oscar nominated song \"Miss Misery.\" Hitting just the right note, his full stop at the end of the film is sweetly depressing as well as marking a new chapter for our main character.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Academy Awards, one of the biggest draws of the film is the Oscar winning script penned by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Thirteen years on and it's still as powerful as it ever was, managing to walk the line between stilted and realistic with an uncanny instinct for everyday conversations and natural dialogue. Even Will's super smart outbursts are grounded by the film's realistic feel. But the screenplay's greatest achievement is the raw emotion that it is capable of evoking. Scenes such as Skylah and Will's fight in the dorm room linger in the mind long after the final credits have rolled. In particular the dialogue between Will and Sean is incredibly powerful, their exchanges both layered and meaningful. Their relationship development is incredibly rewarding, moving from the sizing up of two boys from Southie to two friends with grace and realism. The elegance and simplicity of the plot is astoundingly straightforward with no sudden, attention seeking twists or unstable divergences, instead focussing on extracting every moment of nuance and emotion from various conversations between the characters. It's an incredible achievement, especially in light of the fact that it's the writing debut of Damon and Affleck.\r\n\r\nThe two of them don't let down in the acting department either, with both of them turning in brilliant performances. Damon's character is the main character of the piece and as such his performance is more rewarding in depth and evolution but Affleck does well with the screentime allotted to him. He is funny and loudmouthed as well as playing the role of Will's best friend with uncharacteristic restraint. Damon's performance easily outshines him, however, moving from dangerously inflamed to easy-going with style. Jason Bourne may be his best known character but his performance here is so beautifully vulnerable and simply realistic that it's easily his best performance to date. His love interest in the film is a delightful Minnie Driver who is able to evoke a goofy sense of humour at times while being undeniably powerful in the more emotional scenes. But the star here is Robin Williams, the manic stand-up bringing forth an incredible performance filled with nuance and humour as well as depth and vulnerability. His delivery of some exquisitely crafted speeches make an incredible document almost obsolete with such astounding timing and realism that it's difficult to tell where the acting ends and Williams begins. He is quietly, understatedly brilliant in the midst of an incredible cast.\r\n\r\nWith an eternally brilliant script, beautiful direction and amazing performances all round, Good Will Hunting is as close to perfect as movies get.\r\n\r\nDefining Scene:\r\nTough one to pick but it has to be Sean and Will's second meeting. A rivetting piece of acting from Williams combined with one of the best monologues in the film.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\nDo you like apples?\r\nYeah.\r\nWell, I got her number. How do you like them apples?\r\n\r\nI read your book last night.\r\nSo you're the one.\r\n\r\nWhat if I said I wouldn't have sex with you again 'til I got to meet your friends; what would you say? \r\nI'd say it's 4:30 in the morning; they're probably up.\r\n\r\nReal loss is only possible when you love something more than you love yourself. \r\n\r\nYou're legally allowed to drink now, so we figured the best thing for you was a car. \r\n\r\nLook - you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way. In twenty years, if you're still livin' here, comin' over to my house to watch the Patriots games, still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. That's not a threat; now, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you. \r\n\r\nSo this is a Harvard bar, huh? I thought there'd be equations and shit on the wall.\r\n\r\nSee, the sad thing about a guy like you is in fifty years you're gonna start doin some thinkin on your own and you're gonna come up with the fact that there are two certainties in life. One, don't do that. And two, you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on a fuckin education you coulda got for a dollar fifty in law away charges at the public library.\r\n\r\nWhy shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.? That's a tough one, but I'll take a shot. Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never met, never had no problem with, get killed. Now the politicians are sayin', \"Oh, send in the Marines to secure the area\" 'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some kid from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass. And he comes back to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And, of course, the oil companies used the skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back, of course, and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs, and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive, so he's got to walk to the fuckin' job interviews, which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin', 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat, the only blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. So what did I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure fuck it, while I'm at it why not just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? I could be elected president.",

From the performances most notably the lead Matt Damon whom plays Will Hunting a damaged individual with great intelligence and Robin Williams who plays his psychiatrist Sean, To the morale story and ending that proceeds, to every snappy and inspring dialogue exchange, this movie is beautiful.\n\nEssentially, the movie is about the friendship of two lonely individuals whom are scared to \u00e2play a hand in life\u00e2\u009d, not Will\u00e2(TM)s superior intellect, nor the manipulation of society. Both Sean and Will need each other, in order to move on in life, even if the two try and deny/avoid it throughout. Instead of the movie becoming a full-on soppy drama, there are injections of humor and violence, which prevent the audience from being too complacent, and Gus Van Sant deserves props for this.\n\nGood Will Hunting, although predictable is filled to the brim with everything that one could imagine to see in a movie going-experience, though all is done with such superb quality, to the extent that the lessons learnt will last for life.",

            "content": "A paramount of film making at its best, this Gus Van Sant film truly inspires the mind while telling a story. Movie making is an art and only those movies which can keep an audience enthralled for its entire length can be called great. In this we can say that it is definitely very opinionated as what enthralls a certain person might not do the same for another. But sometimes a rare gem is produced which captivates all audiences and all sections of people regardless of their own likes and dislikes. Good Will Hunting is certainly one of those movies. The premise of this film is a relatively simple one but it takes a great deal of introspection to even delve into what actually makes this movie brilliant. This film plays host to a very good cast which includes the likes of Matt Damon in his breakthrough role as the protagonist Will Hunting, Robin Williams as the troubled shrink Sean Maguire, Ben Affleck as ?Chuckie?, Minnie Driver as Skylar and Stellan Skarsgard as Professor Gerald Lambeau. \r\nThe screenplay itself is a work of art which makes the film instantly quotable, like Casablanca. The plot revolves around south Boston which is the relatively poor section of Boston, where four friends drink and make merry with all sorts of debauchery and the like. The movie really begins when Will gets arrested for assault and is presented a reprieve by the court. Will is portrayed as a troubled youth who is incredibly intelligent and can solve mathematical problems that baffle the rest of the academia. Lambeau discovers this when he sets his students a very difficult problem and finds out that it was solved by one of the janitors whom he later identifies as Will and immediately tries to get Will to alter his current lifestyle in order to get him to focus on his own life and achieve the greatness that he undoubtedly can. He tries to get him to see psychiatrists as per the court order but is unable to find one who can handle Will?s personality and finally calls on his old college roommate Sean Maguire.\r\n What really strikes gold in this movie is the subtle relationships of the persons involved. As Sean tells Lambeau, the reason Will hangs around with his ?retarded gorilla? friends is because they would lay down their lives and take a bat to his head at the drop of a hat. The concept of Freudian psycho social development is very interestingly portrayed with the sessions between Will and Sean. These sessions in my opinion forms the crux of the movie and shows us the depth in both the characters. A scene especially comes to mind where Sean takes Will down to the lake and tells him that he is in fact a kid, a very smart kid but just a kid. Will?s personality throughout the movie is one of detachment and sarcasm. This is what is completely focused on during the sessions with Sean. To over analyze this film would be to take away the simplicity of the movie and that would really damper the style in which this movie has been made. Will?s relationship with Skylar is a very, for lack of a better term, complicated yet sweet affair. The way her character is portrayed is fascinating. She is shown as a woman who is very well to do with no air about it. She in fact says that she would give all her money away for just another day with her father. Driver plays her part extremely well being the girl that changes Will?s life. The movie progresses at a very steady pace and you can identify with a lot of the nuances in the movie. Written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck themselves, earning an academy award for best original screenplay and another academy award for Robin Williams for best actor in a supporting role. One of the most touching scenes in the film is where Sean and Will both share that they were victims of child abuse and Sean helps Will understand that it was not his fault in anyway and thus pushing him onto the road for recovery. \r\nThe movie at its base is probably about the complex relationship between a rough, troubled, extraordinarily gifted working class youngster and his equally messed up therapist. Matt Damon plays his part to perfection making the step by step transformation very credible and extremely believable. The soundtrack perfectly complements the dialogue and direction and gives it that something extra.\r\nAll in all a brilliant performance by Damon in the lead, a superlative performance by Williams and the rest of the cast makes this psychological drama one for the ages. In the end, this movie is beautifully made, engaging till the very end and often very touching.",

            "content": "This is one of those films that you cant help but walk away from without being touched in some way. All of the central themes to adult life are explored and exposed by a very good cast. Friendship, love, pain, the past holding back who we could be in the present, acceptance (or not) of our place in society.\n\n\"Good Will Hunting\" is the story of Will Hunting played by Matt Damon. He is a young man who is a mathematical genius but has no formal education and who is so traumatized by his past that he will not allow himself to be the man he could be with the talents he possesses. Will works as a Janitor, but chose the Massachusetts institute of technology (the finest mathematical institution in America as we are told) as the place to work in order to be close to an outlet for his brilliance. Early on in the story, the resident Math guru Professor Gerry Lambeau (played by Stellan Skarsgard) sets a problem for his students to solve which should take the whole semester for the average mind. When this problem is solved and written on the faculty blackboard the very next morning, he sets another that took him personally two years to solve. The following day he is conversing with a colleague when he witnesses Will writing down the perfect solution on the blackboard again. The Professor realizes he has a genius hiding in his midst.\n\nWhen Will is later involved in a fight, he is eventually given the choice between a short prison term or working with the Professor on a daily basis and also attending psychiatric therapy sessions. Will chooses the latter but uses the therapy sessions as a chance to mock the Psychiatrists assigned to him and show off his knowledge. When no one else will work with him, Professor Lambeau turns to his old room mate at college, Sean MacGuire (played by Robin Williams on Oscar winning form.) who manages to reach the boy emotionally and start to repair the damage that has been done to him.\n\nIt is widely known that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck co wrote the screen play as a reaction to their slow progress in establishing Hollywood careers. It is a testament to their talent as writers that they came up with so many touching scenes and dialogue. In particular, Williams monologue to Damon as they sat on the park bench is touching and profound. Will's relationship with \"Skylar\" (played by Minnie Driver) is perfectly believable and as the story unfolds the viewer can see the change in Will's character from the cocky kid, pushing everyone away, to the young man who understands who he could be with the right encouragement.\n\nThere are very few flaws to be found in this film, largely because the story is so well told and Robin Williams performance is worth the entry price alone. It is a genuinely touching experience which relates to so many people and is easy to empathize with in real life. The characters are richly written. You really do care what happens to these people...Which is the mark of any good movie, in my opinion.\n\nNot to mention the casting was near perfect. Robin Williams shines in his role and deserved his Oscar win. Sometimes it's easy to question when they give The supporting actor award to someone who cut his teeth in comedy like Robin Williams, it's looked more as a token award at times, but Williams performance is anything but. Just a truly amazing performance. Good performance from Matt Damon in the central role, I mean he does get a bit annoying at times but that's the mark of a great character performance, because i feel he was intended to annoy you in way. Stellan Skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to step foot outside of Europe, as always \"shines\". Ben Affleck doesn't do anything he's not known for already, but still was good as the \"big brother type\", Minnie Driver and Matt Damon's on-screen chemistry was undeniable, and for the most part enjoyed Driver's performance at times but also found her a little too \"goofy\" for my tastes. Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser also give some decent lines but nothing too memorable.\n\nOverall, I thought this movie was believable and touching, without your typical ending. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really have done themselves good, with the magnificent writing of the film and deserved the praise and the Oscars for their work. But My advice: Forget the Oscar nominations, the rave reviews, the famous faces, and sit down to watch this movie with a completely impartial attitude. You will see that it really is great film. All in all an uplifting and worthwhile film, which will stay with you long after.",

By letting the story speak for itself and foregoing the intrusion of directorial flourishes, Van Sant makes a powerful story speak even louder. This is a story than can speak to anyone and Van Sant lets that happen. \"Good Will Hunting\" is a 90s classic for all the right reasons and it's a lovely example of purely great filmmaking. Each filmic aspect comes together perfectly for a wonderful final product.",

Simple, well-acted, with a story that everyone with an IQ of 70+ can understand.\n\nMatt Damon, sporting his best attempt at a Dawson's Creek mid-90's haircut, plays Will, a disturbed genius born on the \"wrong side of the tracks\" and seems to not only accept his lot but embrace it. A life of menial construction and janitorial work, pub crawls, and fist fights with anyone who looks at you wrong. \n\nBut as a janitor, will is under-stimulated. So he anonymously answers a super-tough math question posted in the hall by a math professor for his students. He gets discovered, and the math prof takes Will under his wing, the only problem being Will has court-ordered counselling after his most recent fist-fight. Enter Robin Williams, a hairy 5'3 beast as always, but his brain for once is not self-medicating itself with his own bodily-created methamphetamine...A geeky way of saying Robin Williams has settled down, and is great as a similarly-disturbed counselor.\n\nWill and him form a special friendship that you believe. The movie is perhaps predictable, but it still holds your interest all the way through as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's breakout movie. My favorite part besides Robin Williams (who thankfully won an oscar for this) is a great speech Ben Affleck makes near the end of the movie. Where he basically explains it's ok, it's cool if you're not super smart and have to live a simple blue-collar life: It's honorable, and it's OK, but IF, IF you have great creative potential you're robbing the world of a genious and robbing yourself of your destiny. Something I think is great advice.\n\nThe movie would be absolutely legendary and a 6/5 star movie (you read that right) if it wern't for Will's love interest played by a deftly annoying Minnie Driver. She's a flake with an annoying accent, cries all the time, and seems like the exact kind of girl a real world Will would reject. Or maybe that's just my opinion. I also wish they went more in-depth into Peter Skaarsgard's math prof...Who is extreamly driven and competitive to the point of needing therapy himself, in my opinion. But, the movie barely touches on that. Maybe time constraints?\n\nStill, it's the best movie of 1997 hands down, and probably the best cultural piece of any medium to come out of 1997 as far as I know. Seriously, what else was there? Go watch it.\n\nMatt",

He has a troubled life and has never allowed himself to live up to his abilities. Will gets into a fight and he has to choose between a prison stretch or attending psychiatric therapy sessions. Pushed into a corner he opts for the sessions and meets Robin Williams' Sean Maguire. The film is an amazing look into the ever changing relationships Will has and with the new people he meets; his friends, psychiatrist and love interest played brilliantly by Minnie Driver are all put to the test as Will struggles with intimacy and relationships. The characters and dialogue are both rich and the film is simply a delight to watch. Kudos to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who proved their credentials by writing the script.

This movie is a very original story about two friends from Boston. One who faces severe emotional issues and the other a carefree person with no relations.\r\n\r\nWill is one of the brightest mathematicians in the whole world. When supposed to be one of the toppers of MIT ironically he works as the janitor over there. With a rather grumpy ruffian behaviour he ends up in jail. The professor at MIT identifying his rare talent gets him on bail under conditional basis that he needs to meet a counsellor to mend his ways. \r\n\r\nThe story is about the rare bond of friendship between Robin Williams and Matt Damon which finally gives a certain degree of happiness to our souls.\r\n\r\nThe movie's script written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon is so good that some dialogues really touches your heart and has a wider inner meaning. Director Gus Van Sant satisfies the viewers with total entertainment. He had brought out the talent of the rising star Matt Damon through this movie. The chemistry between Matt Damon and Robin Williams is perfect and splendid. Even Ben affleck who plays his best friend from childhood who wants him to go forward with life rather than stay where they stand right now. \r\n\r\nFascinating enthralling and captivating this movie is one of the best original scripts ever written and with truly awesome performances this film will entertain you ,provoke your thoughts and make you love Will.\r\n\r\nMy rating : A",

For quite a long time, the film consists of talky, in-depth explanations of the characters it details. Each character seemed to be studied to a certain depth, with Williams\u00e2(TM)s and Damon\u00e2(TM)s characters being expounded upon greatly. It takes at least forty-five minutes for the premise to be officially established, where we first see Dr. Maguire start to work with Will. After that, the film spends its precious time trying to explain upon this premise, but the pacing is so slow that it ends up going a very short distance.\n\nPerhaps the greatest relief GOOD WILL HUNTING had to offer was Williams\u00e2(TM)s performance. Watching him break away from his comedic comfort zone is like listening to Afrika Bambaataa try to yodel. What\u00e2(TM)s even more odd (and impressive), he succeeds enormously. If there is one performance that makes this film watchable, it\u00e2(TM)s that from Robin Williams. I\u00e2(TM)ll include mention that this opened up the careers of other recognizable names such as Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Those two are impressive in their acting roles, but Williams is the one that seems to shine.",

It's funny to watch it now and think of the careers of the principal cast in the years after. Damon is now a bona fide star with great turns in 'Talented Mr Ripley', 'The Informant!' and 'True Grit' and of course the Borne films. Williams is still living off the Oscar he got for this role and is mixing poor comedies with some interesting dramatic choice ('One Hour Photo', 'Insomnia') and Affleck has gone from action knucklehead to renowned director. To be fair on all of them this film gives a clear indication where their careers were destined. Damon is outstanding in the lead role and brings a vulnerability to a character that on paper could be seen as very unlikable. Williams plays it straight and subdued and then lets rip with the baseball scene and his confrontations with Damon and Skarsgan. Affleck is good in the supporting role but brilliant in his last scene with Damon and his final moments waiting outside his door. He isn't the strongest actor here but he plays it well and the fact that he wrote the script with Damon shows that his talents were always going to be evident behind the camera too. The film still feels fresh today and even if some moments are a bit too 'Hollywood' (e.g. \"It's not your fault\") then the film can be forgiven for that. Damon and Affleck should write again.",

The narrative, while at times predictable or pretentious, is tough when it needs to and intimate when it should be, allowing the audience to see the unraveling/arc of both Damon's (a brilliantly-minded young man with a tough exterior, but troubling past) and Robin Williams's (a community college professor who has trouble forgetting the death of his wife) characters. Essentially, both characters must come to terms with their past, and while one is the therapist and the other the client, they require the help of each other to do so. It is because of this and the keen directorial eye Gus Van Sant that make the moments between these two exceptional yet stubborn men (my favorite being Williams's monologue by the lake) the heart and best scenes of the film. The supporting cast, with their own problems and realizations, as well as their influences on Damon's character, are well-rounded and well-performed as well. There is motivation to be found in the story and script as well as some funny and quirky moments that pull the film together nicely. Good Will Hunting is a different kind of uplifting and charming film, and it is all the more better for it.",

Speaking of Oscars, this film won for \"Best Writing (Original Screenplay)\" and was praised for its \"original and realistic dialogue\".

The film oozes predictability (just watch any other inspirational film from the 90s) and the cliches piled up so fast that it almost felt like the film was a self-aware satire of inspirational films.",

On top of that, this movie didn't feel annoyingly Boston-ish, like some of - sorry, all of - the recent movies in Boston have. Gus Van Sant has a peculiar style about him, but he's got great focus, and he does a great job bringing out things like intimacies and themes. Mostly, my problems were with the characters themselves, in that most of them, like Will, would change their demeanor instantly at the flip of a switch. It isn't so much a problem for Will's buddies because they fight all the time, though that got to be pretty tiring after a while, but instead for characters like the teacher and the girlfriend. Will and the teacher are brats, Will's cronies are morons, and his lady friend is chronically underdeveloped, so we start cheering for Robin Williams' character by default. Successfully helping Will would be a great success story, but it would also shut him up and make him mature, and I think I was rooting for both of these equally.",

Meanwhile, for the first time ever, Will is falling in love and is trying to live his own life, rejecting any help offered.\r\n\r\nRead my full review here: http://mattsfilmreviews.blogspot.com/2011/05/good-will-hunting-1997.html",

It's a brilliant film, a masterpiece really. It's one of those movies that I could watch on a weekly basis. It's intelligent, it has huge heart, it's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and it's about as close to perfection, when it comes to filmmaking, as you can get. This was the movie that allowed Gus Van Sant to take his career where he wanted to, and that makes it an even more special achievement.\n\nWill Hunting works as a janitor at one of the most prestigious schools in the country, M.I.T. When a professor puts a virtually impossible to solve problem up on the chalk board outside of his classroom, Will solves it. The professor tracks him down and gets him out of some legal trouble. All he has to do to avoid jail is work with the professor with math and go to counseling. He's fine with the math, but hates the idea of counseling. As the story goes on he meets a girl and we slowly learn why he is so stuck in the position in life that he is and why he is unwilling and unable to use his unique skill.\n\nWhat hits you right off the bat with this film is how smooth the dialogue flows, and that's a testament to the writing of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who just won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. Then the performances hit you. Damon is phenomenal. Stellan Skasgard is great, even Affleck and Minnie Driver are really good. But everyone knows that Robin Williams steals the show and also, justly, wins a best supporting actor Oscar for his turn as Sean, Will's counselor. Van Sant's direction is also good, but with a screenplay like this and actors on top of their game, it makes it a lot easier.\n\nIf you're one of the five people who haven't seen this film, you definitely need to. It's one of those must see movies. It's hard to describe just how good the film is with words, you just need to see it to truly know.\u00a0",

Granted, my expectations for \"Good Will Hunting\" weren't big; what amount of something's got to give to make a feel-good story about a troubled genius and the MIT professor and psychologist fighting for his mind's right to party really pop? The answer: not a lot. It's boiler plate as the Danny Elfman score playing over it; Robin Williams seems to be borrowing a little too obviously from his character in \"Dead Poets Society\"; and Ben Affleck and Matt Damon winning an Oscar in '98 for original screenplay over Paul Thomas Anderson for \"Boogie Nights\"? Give me a break. \n\nNonetheless \"Good Will Hunting\" enjoyably yarns the tale of exactly that, a smart and silenced kid with a head full of scattered ideas and a heart tripped in paranoia. There's no denying Affleck and Damon's sentiment toward \"Good Will Hunting's\" screen troupers, and the dedication at letting you walk out with a smile on your face.",

Perhaps it's because the film seems to hit every Oscar-baity note perfectly, or because the actors have gone on to careers that don't often match the heights of this great film.  Whatever the reason is, Good Will Hunting is still a captivating watch, and it's hard to heed the criticism when a film is such a satisfying package.\r\n\r\nBen Affleck and Matt Damon's Oscar-winning screenplay put them on the map, and for good reason.  While the story is simply, the characters within it are beautifully drawn out, especially the titular Will Hunting (Damon) and his mentor, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams in a career-best performance).  Some of the supporting characters come off as caricatures, but if anything, they provide some welcome comic relief from the film's more dramatic moments.\r\n\r\nWilliams' performance is one for the ages.  The typically comic actor does so well when given a meatier dramatic role to tackle, and Good Will Hunting provides him with his finest part to date.  Williams still has a slyness in line with much of his other work, but he also perfectly communicates the pain of loss, his faith in Will, and a general caring nature.  His scenes with Damon represent the film at its very best; the chemistry, whether they're arguing or finally forging an emotional connection, is fantastic.  Their relationship serves as the heart of a truly great, and very deservedly celebrated, modern classic.",

            "content": "A great performance by an actor is always a welcome addition to any movie. Witnessing true chemistry between stars, however, is even more rewarding. The focus seems to shift  from the talents of individual rolls and rather to an intangible beauty that is created by the interactions of distinctive characters. Such is a rare and welcome occurrence indeed, and I was happy to see 'Good Will Hunting' accomplish such a feat. \r\n\r\nThe film follows the life of an amazingly gifted young man named Will Hunting. Will, played by Matt Damen, works as a janitor at the prestigious MIT school in Boston Mass. The irony of his position at the college surfaces when a highly decorated mathematics teacher discovers Will's talents for solving equations that only a hand full of people in the world could decipher. When the professor approaches him to discuss his talents, he discovers that Will hardly fits the description of a typical genius scholar. Fascinated further by his conflicted personality but unable to break through the boy's defensive nature, Professor Lambeau employs the talents of a old colleague and psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams, who received an Oscar for this work) to help Will find a direction for his life that will allow him to realize his full potential. \r\n\r\nIt is at this point where the film enjoys a breath of new life. When Damen and Williams exchange banter on screen, it is both entertaining and magical. I was extremely impressed at how well Damen was able to keep up with the seasoned Robin Williams. They effortlessly reinforce each others characters as the dialogue amongst them ensues. Though they lead contrasting lives, an uneasy respect is formed by their curious commonalities and views of the world. Through sharing their pains and triumphs alike, the two unearth past issues that have impacted them both deeply. \r\n\r\nMy fascination with these two stands as the highlight of the film. This is not to say that I was entirely disappointed with the remainder of the cast, but they served more as indicators of Will's progression rather than individual sub stories. When he corresponds with his love interest or friends, it offers little beyond a peak into the complexities of his personality and where the therapy is taking him. Alone, this may seem like a meager contribution from an actor, but they remain a necessary piece of the puzzle. \r\n\r\nThe only marked exception to this circumstance is the sarcastic exchanges that Professor Lambeau and Sean enjoy throughout the film. There is a playful tension between the two that offers enough charm to remain a pleasant diversion from Will's journey.\r\n\r\nWith so much invested in the maturity of Will and Sean's relationship and into unraveling Will's multifaceted persona, some other aspects of the movie do suffer somewhat. Scenes begin to feel a little rushed near the climax, as if the director panicked to tie up every loose end. This caused the intensity of the story to flicker a bit. However, as hurried as these scenes may feel, the final act does offer a fitting resolution that should leave most audiences satisfied. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the strength lies within the for mentioned chemistry that transpires. Without this brilliance I believe the film would have fallen flat. When the two are apart, the script begins to lose its luster. There are no amazing plot twists, no catastrophic turn of events, but rather a story that probes into facets of aspirations and the desire for purpose of life. Such a tale demands a high calabur of artistic execution by its leads to outshine the movies weaknesses, and 'Good Will Hunting' does just that. \r\n\r\nRating: 8 out of 10",

The difference is that while Amadeus is told from the perspective of the people around the genius who can only marvel at his abilities, Good Will Hunting is told more from the perspective of the genius and his struggles to belong to the world instead of be set apart from it.  Unlike Amadeus's Mozart, Will Hunting is not arrogant or self-serving, although he doesn't shy away from telling people how good he is.  But he's so afraid of failure that he won't push himself.  The story is perhaps a little too pat and the ending is expected, but the performances make up for these minor shortcomings.",

Will has a long record of getting into trouble with the law, while downplaying and hiding the fact that he is a genius in the area of mathematics.  Instead of going to jail for assaulting a police officer, the judge agrees to allow Will to leave under the care of a math professor as long as Will meets the conditions of working on difficult math problems with this new mentor of his, and that Will visits regularly with a psychologist.  At first, Will does everything he can to avoid therapy, but he begins to open up more once he meets a counselor named Sean, who is played by Robin Williams. Will gradually begins to understand the importance of accepting himself and the past experiences who have made Will who he is in present day, as well as learning to take risks to allow new people into his life. In the past Will has learned to push people away before they have a chance of hurting him or letting him down. Through his counseling sessions, Will begins to accept the fact that he needs to open up to others so he can start to experience parts of life that he has been missing.",

The storyline itself may seem a little \"fairytale\", (boy brought up in a foster home but is an academic genius), but Damon and Affleck have worked hard to avoid clich\u00e9s and a typical ending.\r\n\r\nThe strength in Good Will Hunting is all down to the screenplay and the performances from the actors. Damon is excellent and Affleck is equally as good. Damon manages to come across as very charming and likeably almost instantly rather than a boy who sits around feeling sorry for himself. On the other hand Damon might seem a little \"pretty-boy\" for someone who has been abused in several foster homes but Damon's acting makes you forget all that as he comes across very threatening and violent, in particular \"the break-up \" scene. This just shows what a great actor Matt Damon is. Robin William's is outstanding, especially in the scenes with Damon and his rival, (the college professor who discovered Hunting in prison0, played superbly by Stellan Skarsguard. From the begging there is a clear link and similarity to Will Hunting and William's character which the two actors portray on screen with real emotion and reality.\r\n\r\nThe director, Gus Van Sant, quite rightly chooses to avoid any soppy and unnecessary sentimental value just for the audience's sake, but instead finds real human emotion within the harsh story of Will's upbringing but never goes too overboard with the details. The film provides both heart and humour, in particular the friends Will hangs around with as there is a great chemistry between all four of them and some very funny banter dialogue.\r\n\r\nDanny Elfman's score fits perfectly with the backdrop of Harvard and the city of Boston. It creates a sense of security and calmness. With dramatic scenes there is no music which shows how powerful the actor's performances are as the scenes are still very effective. This shows Van Sant's clever choice to show off his actors and how he respects their performances.\r\n\r\nGood Will Hunting is a fantastic movie with an amazing script, elegant direction and magnificent performances. Scripts like this do not get written very often and Damon and Affleck have written a masterpiece which will be studied by all who wish to write the perfect movie screenplay.",

Minnie Driver, Ben Affleck, Stellan Skarsgard, and Casey Affleck round out a very good ensemble. Despite some excellent acting (especially from Damon, Williams, and Driver), moments of great writing (the film was written by--and won Oscars for--Damon and Ben Affleck themselves), and being very easy to watch, Good Will Hunting left me slightly cold.

The brilliant cast includes Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, and Stellan Skarsgard. The premise is rather simple, it follows a trouble genius who forms an unexpected and important friendship with his psychiatrist who tries to help him find his way in life. The Academy Award winning screenplay is precise and brilliant featuring well written characters, clever dialogue, and a truly solid story structure. Good Will Hunting is not only one of the best movies of 1997, but you could also make the argument that it is one of the finest movies ever made.\r\n\r\nThe performances are absolutely incredible. Matt Damon's complex and witty performance as Will Hunting almost steals the show. He absolutely takes control of all of the movie's toughest scenes. His performance is unexpectedly moving and heartfelt. The reason why I say ALMOST steals the show is because of the amazing precense of Robin Williams. Together the two form a bizzare and unique friendship and they generate solid chemistry. The best scenes of the movie are when Williams and Damon are just yakking at eachother. It's brilliant. The supporting cast helps here a lot as well though too. Affleck is almost non-existent, but his character is important to the story's final arc, so I give credit to the writing more than him. Casey Affleck adds some unexpected and unusual comic relief in an extremely small role. The gorgeous Minnie Driver is great as Damon's potential \"soulmate\" and her character Skylar is another extremely brilliantly written character. Finally, Stellan Skarsgard's small but pivotal role is great as well. \r\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite movies of all-time. It's a very moving and touching portrait about a troubled man and it offers a lot of vivid and interesting outlooks on life and the direction in which we all choose to take. I admire the smart and relaxed direction by Van Sant, who just let his actors act and he lets the dialogue and the characters take over the film, which evokes some serious emotion. This film had a profound effect on me. After I saw it, I literally could not get the film out of my head. The characters and the dialogue stuck with me. That's when you know you've got a truly amazing and classic film on your hands.\r\n\r\nGood Will Hunting is a masterpiece.",

Superb performance again from Damon.\r\n\r\nHowever, what has to stand out for me was Williams' performance. He was the fatherly-figure, and damn, he was good! He simply kills the role, and he really deserves full credit for his magical touch as the heartwarming fella. Stunning.\r\n\r\nI can see why the idea of a brilliant yet misguided loser was (and is) so loved. Probably, ten years on, the plot has been so recycled that we are forced to endure the mindless and meaningless ideas. Well, wake up guys, this is the benchmark for movies like this. Good Will Hunting delivered its message through excellent acting, wholesome plot and most of all, the loving effect it wanted to convey.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally* ...

The connections made between men in the movie almost always come reluctantly, though heightened melodrama helps to clarify and make all too apparent the significance of these moments to the characters development. This may come across this day and age as somewhat trite and or predictably sentimental as it all builds to the obvious enlightening of the Will Hunting character, but what makes the movie as good as it is are the details in Vant Sant's delicate handling of each character in the film and his ability to balance out every moment to enrich the personalities of everyone in the story. In the end, we care about these people.. and in a movie dealing with such \"thoughtful\" material, giving equal emotional weight is no small accomplishment.\n\nThe other extremely notable theme in the film I've always appreciated belongs to the mathematician's character, who although very much an intelligent and gifted individual on his own terms, cannot live up to the natural abilities of the young prodigy. His emotional low at the end of the second act is inadvertently a 'high' point of the film.",

The film itself is not a waste. I even liked it at somepoints. It's just that the film is so predictabble, that it loses its mind. THE MAIN PROBLEM I HAVE WITH HARMLESS DRAMAS LIKE THEESE, IS THAT THEY'RE LIKE A TURTLE: IT'S TOO AFRAID TO LEAVE ITS SHELL. It only wants to show us what they find sad. I want people who arn't winny. I want oscar bait like Annie Hall and American Beauty and Traffic. Not like The shawshank redemption (surprisingly) the blind side and such. I do not like this film for not taking that step in story to make it ugly. For exaple add some rock and roll music over piano music. Add some boobs over crybaby bitches. Matt Damon is supposed to be some crazy criminal, make him more crazy criminal. Make him not care for Robin Williams's character. Don't make him a winey bastard.

Being brought up in a rough childhood, from foster home to foster home, Will is hanging out with his best friends: Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Billy Mcbride (Cole Hauser), and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck). His friends basically go to a bar everyday and get drunk. Will doesn't mind but he gets into a lot of fights throughout his life.\r\n\r\nOne day, he is caught doing an impossible math equation that took the professor, who put it on the chalkboard, two years to complete. They soon find out about his past history as he has been arrest for assaults, grand theft auto, and hitting a police officer the past couple of years. They get him out of jail under a couple of conditions: he helps the professors with math problems and sees a psychiatrist.\r\n\r\nHe sort of blows off the first five therapists he meets until he sees Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), a respectable man who is facing hardships from his wife passing away two years prior. Together, they try to figure out Will's past and future by decreasing his violent moods and try to understand that he is a genius and different from most people.\r\n\r\nGood Will Hunting is fantastic.

            "content": "Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both won an Oscar for their work on this screenplay, but everyone knows that. It\u0092s written from the point of view of someone who actually grew up in Boston, and already had enough experiences for a lifetime. It\u0092s so powerfully written and well directed and is deserving of all its praise.\r\n\r\nIt\u0092s the story of a gifted young adult, Will (Matt Damon), who works as a janitor at MIT and is able to solve extremely difficult math equations left undone. One of the professors sees his talents and tries to mold him into a scholar instead of what he is- a bum.  He ends up beating the hell out of some seemingly random kids on the basketball court and is forced to complete counseling or else be thrown in jail. His counselor is Robin Williams and he really affects Will as a person and gets him to see the world differently- essentially helping him grow up. Once he completes his counseling sessions he is left to find a job, of which he has many offers. His choice lets the audience into Will for the first time and we see what is truly important to him and how mature he has become.\r\n\r\nAbout halfway into the movie I started to become worried- there was no conflict set up yet, and although it was clever and funny it didn\u0092t have any dynamic quality. But then I realized that the main conflict wasn\u0092t between two people, but within Will. He has all this potential and can do anything with his life that he wants, but he doesn\u0092t want it. It\u0092s the characters around him that must shape his final decision.\r\n\r\nMatt Damon was terrific as the lead, although you could tell at times that he was still a bit raw as an actor. And if Damon was terrific then Robin Williams was immaculate in his role. He was required to play off Damon and match his passion and energy level- and I think he beat them. He definitely deserved his Oscar here, even though I really don\u0092t like him as an actor otherwise. Other notable performers here were the Affleck Bros. with my favorite being Ben. Ben Affleck is actually a very talented individual and it is clearly evident in this movie. Direction here was also very good, Gus Van Sant does an excellent job making the script come alive but I think is very much overshadowed by the other aspects of the film.\r\n\r\nDefinitely my new favorite movie and I\u0092ll end my review with my favorite quote from the film, its Ben Affleck talking to Matt Damon about his future, and how he can do better.\r\n\r\nChuckie (Ben Affleck):  Every day I come by your house and I pick you up. And we go out. We have a few drinks, and a few laughs, and it's great. But you know what the best part of my day is? For about ten seconds, from when I pull up to the curb and when I get to your door, 'cause I think, maybe I'll get up there and I'll knock on the door and you won't be there. No goodbye. No see you later. No nothing. You just left. I don't know much, but I know that.",

            "content": "This is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. Everybody that stars in this movie is fantastic, including Ben Affleck. Director Gus Van Zant who directed \"Drugstore Cowboy,\" and \"Milk,\" has made without a doubt one of the best movies of the 1990's. It's such an emotional and wonderful movie to watch that it sticks with you the moment your done watching it. Matt Damon in my opinion gives the best performance of his career in this movie playing Will Hunting, the genius kid from South Boston who solves the big math equation that Stellan Skarsgard's character leaves in the hallway for his the students to solve to only have it mysteriously solved by Damon's character who happens to be the janitor of the college he works at. But for me it's really Robin Williams that sticks out the most for me just because it's Robin freakin' Williams, who gives in my opinion a career defining performance as the therapist that tries to help counsel Damon's character in order to keep him out of jail for getting into a brawl with Affleck and the rest of the crew against these Italians that hang out in the South Boston area and hits a cop in the process of being pulled back from almost beating one of the Italian guys to death. It's a very human performance, one that makes this one very different from all the other performances he has done on screen. It's the one that definitely made him worth of the best supporting oscar that year in 1997. Sure he cracks some good jokes here and there in the film, but he never shies away from his dramatic side through out the movie. Williams has played a lot of great characters on screen, but when I think about which one is my favorite, this performance is the first one to enter my head. I can't say enough about his performance because it felt so real to me the whole time, especially when he goes into talking to Damon's character about his wife who in the film has been dead for two years, but you can clearly see he is still grieving from the loss. And could you blame him? I mean for a man who loved his wife as much as he did in this movie you can see how hard it would be for a person like William's character to move on with his life. It's really when him and Damon really get into it in one therapy session about what Damon's character wants to do with his life and he can't give Williams character a straight answer and when tries to kick Damon out of the therapy session, that's when Damon confronts him and tells him that even though he lost a big hand that some people after losing a big hand like that have the sack to get back up and try again...and he's right. Both men are very compelling in the film and what makes the movie so great is the interaction between Damon and Williams that through the therapy sessions, both men learn to heal and move on with their lives, that's what makes the movie so great. I literally balled my eyes out when I was watching the movie last night with my sister at the scene when Williams character tells Damon that it's not his fault to what happened to him as a foster child, but Damon's character doesn't want to hear it, but Williams keeps pursuing Damon to realize that it is not your fault that were abused it was the asshole foster father that is to blame for beating him. And what makes it so great is that at one point Damon gets defensive and pushes Williams away telling him not to fuck with him, but Williams doesn't let down and keeps telling him it's not your fault. And when the two men finally embrace each other and hug it out it's truly a work of art, and in that scene Gus Van Zant definitely deserved the best director nomination for the movie. Such a compelling scene that I'm almost feeling the emotions as I'm writing this. This is a movie that will live on through the ages, and it should, because this is a movie that hits you where it hits best...right in the heart.",

            "content": "It's like the original \"A Beautiful Mind\", partially because, like Russell Crowe, Matt Damon's acting peak's with this film. No, he's not bad in everything after this film; he was just never given material a big as this, and that's a shame, because he is a heck of an actor, as we can see here, where he has to take on the challenging task of acting like he's from Boston. Yeah, I know he's a Bostonite, but even if - nay - especially if you're from the part of Boston he's from, it's hard to go back, and boy, Matt's boyfriend, Ben will probably never let us forget that, because he built his entire career around his scorn. Seriously Ben, get over it like your buddy has, because he's played a cowboy, a Grimm brother, a CIA officer, a butt-kicking spy, a southern lawyer, a god and, heck, even a cartoon horse; but after this film, he's never gone back to Boston, except for \"The Departed\", and even then, he ended up...- well, I'll just leave you to see that terrible ending to such a really good film yourself. Hey, if you ask me, Damon should probably go back to Boston more often, because that is where he comes out with some of his best work, whether it be the aforementioned \"The Departed\", or this film. Seriously, the score, the subject matter and even the title all come together to form this: ...cheesiness. I mean, it's still a really good film, but man, this film is so cheesy that even the color overlay on the poster is yellow.\r\n\r\nOkay, so the film isn't terribly cornball, but there is a degree of sentimentality exacerbated by Elfman's sappy score, as well as formula in the story. The film isn't terribly formulaic, but neither is it too hard to predict where it's going, because the storyline is still so familiar, and yet, we still don't know enough about our characters. Okay, to be fair, at least the characters have some twists to them to make them unique, yet we don't get to see those twists right away, as the film is lacking in immediate development. Sure, we get to know them after a while, but mostly through expendable scenes of casualty, and while they don't overuse use those moments of casualty to the point of summoning disengagement, let alone tedium, but it certainly slows down the film. Really, I believe the problem to be Gus Van Sant's direction, which doesn't seem to fit the high intellegence of the screenplay. I mean, his direction isn't in the least terrible, nor does it even damage the film a whole lot, but he's such a sentimental storyteller handed a script that requires a director competent enough to provide emotional resonance, as well as a strong aura of sophistication, and while Van Sant's direction is still \"just\" smart enough, leaving the tone of the film to sometimes feel rather inconsistent. However, again, it's not like Van Sant is totally destroying the film, for although this film could have easily been better in the hands of a sentimental, as well as highly intellectual director, Van Sant's tone is \"just\" smart enough for you to feel most of the beats of Damon and Affleck's screenplay, and really, a \"just smart enough\" execution is alright with me, because no matter how low this film sinks on the rarest of occasions, you never forget that Damon and Affleck won that screenplay Oscar for a reason.\r\n\r\nAs I said earlier, Damon and Affleck tread familiar ground in the writing department, but don't dwell on the conventions of this storyline too much, keeping it slick enough to the point of not being terribly refreshing, yet still sharp enough for you to overlook the predictability. It certainly helps that the dialogue that Damon and Affleck have prepared is pretty darn sharp, whether when it comes to dealing with just some good ol' fashion, leave you chuckling snappy lines and back-and-forths, or portraying most of our characters in a believable fashion, particularly our lead character, Will Hunting, who's extreme level intellegence is most certainly made palpable by his cleverness and plenty of knowlege to back him up, yet he's not over-the-top, neither as a genius or a troubled mind, for the writers have found a perfect balance between the two defining attributes to our lead to make him totally believable as a human: flawed, believable and generally compelling. Speaking of Matt Damon, when I said that this might be his best performance, I wasn't just blowing smoke, because he is killing it dead in this role, bringing in his classic charisma at its sharpest, while seamlessly blending it with a subtle, yet tangible presence that boasts wit, as well as repressed anguish, creating a captivating level of humanity that comes into particularly sharp play when he works off of his fellow castmates, because whether he's hanging out with his chums or going through the motions of his budding romance with Minnie Driver, Damon forms electric chemistry with everyone. However, the chemistry that's most significant is the one between Damon and Robin Williams, and let me tell you, they sold it, put the money in the lottery, won, started a small business where they sold their chemistry, expanded that business, then started a chain of stores that sold their chemistry all across America, then Canada, then the UK, and eventually, three-fourths of the globe. As our leads' comradery builds, the level of compellingness in the film intensifies, as well, and watching the Damon and Williams orchestrate this dance of self-realization and friendship is hypnotic, yet wouldn't be nearly as effective if it wasn't for Gus Van Sant. No, Van Sant wasn't the perfect directing choice for this, but what he lacks in fulfilling the screenplay's level of intellegence, he makes up for by fulfilling it's emotional resonance, because, as I said, he is a very sentimental director, and one strong enough to really sell the heart of this film. For me, that golden moment where everyone running this machine - the writers, the leads and the director - all come together in one powerful moment is the climactic \"It's not your fault\" scene that's so heavily-written, so superbly-acted and so emotionally impacting (Forget it, I cry every time I see the scene), really tying everything together and paving the way for a satisfying conclusion to a film that may not fully live up to greatness, but still leaves you touched.\r\n\r\nAt the end of \"Hunting\" season, you're left looking back at this predictable, sentimental and rather intellectually inconsistent experiment, not minding the flaws, for what ultimately prevails is Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's very clever, very human script that is intensified by emotionally striking direction by Gus Van Sant, but most of all, the powerful performances and chemistry between Matt Damon and Robin Williams, both of whom provide the slickness, emotion and compellingness that carries \"Good Will Hunting\" from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.\n\nWho would have thought that such an intelligent script to the movie was written by Matt and Ben themselves. The writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times. Both Matt and Robin Williams perform wonderfully in their roles. Matt Damon in particular was great as the complex Will Hunting - a genius at maths but a bit of an idiot in human relationships. His rough-edged exterior is simply a cry for help in which Robin Williams' character Sean Maguire does to best to do. Overall this movie is a good production, with solid craftsmanship in all departments -- thanks to the creativity of Damon and Affleck.",

Also, Ben and Casey Affleck give strong supporting performances. The performance that really did it for for though was that of Minnie Driver.

Star (and career making turn) from Matt Damon as the hugely flawed janitor/maths genius ably supported by an arguably career best performance from an Oscar winning Robin Williams. Supporting cast is truly superb as well. Minnie Driver is adorable and she makes the audience adore her after only two short scenes, special stuff and I'll never forget her joke that's told like a pro stand up comedian. Stellan Skarsgard is great in a difficult role to pull off, an arrogant, haunted and intermittently jealous professor who is in some ways the villain of the piece but still remains completely believeable, layered, likeable and human as a character. Casey Affleck also shows the promise he had as an a completely irritating character but in my experience everyone has a friend like him in their group. He always says the wrong thing at the wrong time, you hate him for it at the time but love him for it afterwards. The baseball glove scene is hilarious. Ben Affleck is also standout in some of his scenes as well. The biggest star of the piece though is the script. One of the best scripts to be passed through Hollywood ever I think. Damon and Affleck should really write more or even better do a sequel. Some of the dialogue is superb, Williams (the park scene after Damon has remarked on Williams' painting especially) and Damon both have some great lines. Top this off with now classic scenes ('How do you like them apples!' 'It's not your fault') and a brilliant human story makes for an undeniable stonewall classic movie for me. If you haven't seen it make sure you track it down because it is like Will Hunting made this movie himself. It's that good.",

Damon's character isn't so much an interesting person as he is a fantasy archetype for an actor. His character's brilliance is reasonably explained as unexplainable, but his ability to end arguments and destroy people's self-confidence is fun until we're supposed to see the damage that helped temper his affectations.

His bickering with the oppressive prickishness of Skarsgaard form most of the film's most satisfying moments. Affleck's asides with his younger brother feel more like filler when they're not obviously trying to foreshadow the film's conclusion.\n\nEven though it's problematic on the whole, and it definitely feels like a pet project, it's a damn good one.",

Penned by both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, this touching drama was a true inspiration to watch, a late 90's gem of a film that was hailed by audiences and critics alike.  A tender, sensative and atmospheric film that had me glued to the screen throughout.  A melodic, stoic and swift drama that tells a truly original, marvelously Inspirational and touching tale of the power of believing in one's self.  It's very moving from beginning to end, a film that has minimal flaw, brilliant direction and strong character development.  It's fresh and flat-magnificent, dramatic filmmaking at it's very best, a philosophical symphony of deeply dedicated performances and storytelling.  It's one thing to know that you have a gift, but to utilize and to use that gift to your advantage takes a strong will and the ability to believe in yourself, hence is the dilemma that Will Hunting faces in this film.  Good Will Hunting is fantastic, Affleck and Damon charged onto the scene with this highly-charged, straight-off-the-streets-of-Boston drama, this is the film that allowed both of these superstars to unleash their true talents in both acting and writing.  This is Gus Van Sant's finest hour, and in my opinion his very best film, it features beautiful storytelling, gorgeous cinematography and razor-sharp wit-filled dialogue and one-liners.  I loved it.\n       The acting is spectacular.  Everyone involved ave it their all, and believe me, it shows.  Matt Damin is brilliant in easily the best performance of his career, he hits every end of the emotional spectrum in his performance as Will Hunting, Award-worthy in my opinion.  Ben Affleck adds the film's humor and does a great job throughout.  But for me it was Robin Williams who stole the show, this guy is a true legend in his own right and his performance in this film was one of the crowning achievements of his storied career.  He earned a Best Supporting Actor award for the performance, and he is just splendid to watch.  Cole Hauser and Minnie Driver were great as well.",

She does absolutely wonderful here, and her character is a pleasure to watch as well. Maybe even the best, if not for Williams.

I first saw it back in 98 and right away became my favorite movie... till i saw Mission Impossible 2 when down fell when i saw the first Transformers which changed when i saw the 2nd one. Then The Departed breifly became my favorite movie. Now watching this movie for probably close to the 10th time almost 15 years after i first saw it. it still is rediculiously powerful in every scenes of the word. The story really hits home for me (not in an exact way) which obviously would stir up emotions for me which could be why i love the movie so much. Really is about the past of our lives define our future yet in we shouldnt let that happen in the negative ways. its ok to let people in, even though it may be scary. this movie is completely perfect for ANYBODY with a trouble past with a parent. it will get close to home, for some maybe to close. But Matt Damon opens his career with his best acting in this movie, same with Ben Affleck, only difference is Damon has acted good since. Yet the most impressive acting comes from Robin Williams who just seems born for this movie. Everybody knows him as the comidien but he just simply is this roll and is unforgeable as well. this movie is just so important to me that i cant help but put it back at #1 almost 10 years later",

The movie revolves around the ethics of friendship and loyalty, and conflictions and trials of each.  Most apparent is the rivalry over Damon between Williams the therapist and Stellan Skarsgard the opportunistic teacher.  And, unlike most films, it's hard to pick a side between the two once you see the bond through mathematics Damon and Skarsgard develope, and later the bond between Damon and Williams through how much they relate (both from very similar backgrounds).

Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsgaard, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser are a great ensemble and their accomplished work here is excellent.  Damon and Affleck are obviously smart guys, because the screenplay and story they wrote together is one that sheds light on the human condition and its internal clockwork, as well as people seeing a wonderful potential in another person and hoping they don't squander that potential.  Of course, as this film is set in Boston, there's plenty of realistic and crass dialogue between Will Hunting (Damon) and the people he knows.     \r\n\r\nGus Van Sant illuminates the story with an emphasis on the imperfections of the characters, because he knows those aspects of these people are what makes us care for them.  To be terse, GOOD WILL HUNTING tells the story of a troubled 20-year old orphan with a criminal record who also happens to be a mathematical genius in secret.  His friends don't know it yet, but as he works as a janitor as MIT he solves impossible problems the Math professor lays out for his students.  The story is set in motion when Hunting gets into another fight, and when the professor bails him out on two conditions: solve advanced mathematical formulas he and his colleagues have been studying for years, and to see a therapist weekly.  That therapist comes to be Sean (Williams), a humane professor.  \r\n\r\nSeeing a film as multi-layered in meaning and resonating humanity, I feel that GOOD WILL HUNTING is a film that I can watch several years from now and see new things from a new perspective.  Not to mention from a new standpoint as to what the great dialogue means to me.  \r\n\r\nAbove all else, GOOD WILL HUNTING is a feel-good movie about what it means to grow up and to gain potential in one area of your life and to see as well as utilize that potential for your personal growth.  GOOD WILL HUNTING won two Oscars and was nominated for nine back in 1997.  It won for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor, which are sufficient wins to earn.  It's such a suprise to look back and see that it didn't win more nominations than it did, though.  \r\n\r\nIn any case, GOOD WILL HUNTING is an incredible movie that pays testament to the human spirit, plain and simple.

            "content": "It has taken me several years and many viewings of this film to finally be able to give it the review that I think it deserves, from my point of view. And the very fact this has been a laboured decision has probably been a good thing. Very few of my favourite films have been ones that I can sit down and review right away. They're usually so profound I have to experience them at different points in my life and at every turn, be amazed and vindicated by them.\r\n\r\nGood Will Hunting is no different.\r\n\r\nI want to start with my favourite aspect of the picture: the script. The script is by my definition completely sublime. It moves seamlessly from group dialogue, to one-on-one revelatory back and forth dialogue, to some of the all time best monologues I've ever heard. The monologue, so long associated with the diatribe of a supervillian in action films, is given new meaning here. The script manages to touch upon the many facets of human existence and reaction without sounding contrived or clich\u00e9d. If Damon and Affleck never write another script, never mind. This is one that defies all expectation. There is strong, believable character development throughout. At the moment I empathise with Will; young, ambitious, cocky and uncertain. I expect as I grow older, I will tend to empathise more with Shaun; experienced, intellectual and with an enduring 'down but not out' attitude.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent script is backed up by career defining performances. Matt Damon does a great job of the intelligent yet lost genius Will Hunting. We see that behind a defensive facade there is a fragile, talented individual making tentative steps into a potentially difficult adulthood. Ben Affleck is so good here as Will's best friend that I find it hard to believe he hasn't done anything as poignant since. As a blue-collar man with a simple philosophy (and one of the best monologues in the film, no less) he really defines and exceeds his archetype. Minnie Driver also performs wonderfully in an underrated role as Skylar - as with Affleck she is on such form that I can't believe she has not yet matched this performance. The real star turn here is of course Robin Williams, on startling form as a grieving psychologist. It's hard to describe how pivotal his role without giving away plot points. It suffices to say, it's an excellent study into character dimension.\r\n\r\nWith the script and performances discussed, it must also be said that the cinematography matches the intent of both perfectly. There is a nice mix of both shallow and deep focus shots, interesting and not overstated use of colour when contrasting both in and outdoor scenes and many other pleasing touches a more astute eye than mine will be able to identify. The film is also underpinned by a moving never obtrusive soundtrack; I was delighted to hear Elliott Smith featuring no less than three times.\r\n\r\nTo summarise without drifting into unending hyperbole, yes this film require some suspension of disbelief. If you are particularly gifted in the field that Will is purported to be a genius in, you may have a hard time. Even I identified some of the problems he faces as simplistic. I believe this course of action is taken to prevent alienation of the audience - a complex discussion of the intricacies of advanced mathematics would stiffen the pace and be besides the point. The film is about the journey of the protagonist; how a precarious genius might perceive the world around him or her in such a different way as to make social interaction difficult. It paints such a great picture that I feel that here is an underrated film that should be rendered 'classic' by the passage of time.\r\n\r\nHere's hoping! 9.2/10",

I also really liked the professor played by Stellan Skarsgard, he was really good! I wanted, at times, to see more Robin Williams. I didn't feel like he got enough screen time like I had hoped. I loved the ending, almost made me cry! Good Will Hunting is a great feel-good movie and I recammend it to viewers who like a good, raw story.

It truly emerges as an unconventional yet inspirational drama that cannot be missed.\n\nWill Hunting, as much of a mathematical genius as he may be, instead spends his time as a janitor at MIT and hangs out with his bar buddies in South Boston. His mathematical affinity truly shows when he solves an equation that stumps everybody else. Even though he's been getting in trouble with the law, he is released from jail on two conditions: work with the mathematics professor and see a counselor. Will is initially reluctant but gradually begins to discover his potential.\n\nThis film, in many ways, is unexpected, which is truly a breath of fresh air. Considering this is Ben Affleck's and Matt Damon's debut screenplay, they've done an impressive job with developing a deep but emotionally resonant script that packs some memorable dialogue. Gus Van Sant's direction is positively restrained, allowing the story to tell itself and thus lending the film more of an impact. The acting from the ensemble is great, especially with an incredible dramatic performance from Robin Williams. Beautiful music works crisply amongst the realistic photography. All the while, it has a great sense of humor, really hits the nail emotionally, and exudes an intelligence much like its protagonist's.\n\nYes, the storyline is average and predictable. Thankfully, though, the movie opts for realism over sentiment. Granted, it may have more of the feel of a psychoanalytic study than an actual film and some situations are contrived, but the film still endures to this day.\n\n\"Good Will Hunting\" is more than a good film. It's an excellent drama that's truly moving and suceeds in its purpose.",

Quite a surprise considering my expectations were somewhat low. Two of the actors, Damon and Affleck, also penned the script, and I was prepared for a cute little ego trip by two self-absorbed young actors. Not quite!\r\n\tBostonian Will Hunting (Damon) and his underachiever friends, including Affleck, are resigned to their lives not amounting to much. But Damon has a problem: he's a genius, especially at math. When his talents are discovered by an MIT professor, he is allowed to join an award-winning research group - on the condition that he must go to therapy. Enter psychologist Williams who sees Damon's potential and must try to break through all the objective knowledge and get to the heart of his subject. And, yes, maybe learn a thing or two about himself in the process.\r\n\tThis doesn't sound like anything that we haven't seen before in psychiatrist-patient films, but the unconventional approach and the genuineness of the performances propel this film to a higher level. Damon is sexy and likable even though his character has a gigantic chip on his shoulder. Affleck is carving a good niche for himself as the butch-yet-sensitive straight guy, who in this case wants his buddy to amount to something. Williams is wonderful in low-key mode in the bittersweet role of psychiatrist who can't get over his wife's death. Driver is an odd romantic match for Damon, but is completely captivating and believable. The ultimate message of the film is to honor your talents and heed your calling. Best of all, the elements of the story tie in together nicely while still avoiding a neatly packaged ending. Great acting and great writing rarely come from the same source, but I wouldn't be surprised to see Affleck and Damon as nominees and winners on Oscar night for Best Original Screenplay. QUEER QUOTIENT: Openly gay director Gus Van Sant (My Own Private Idaho, To Die For) obviously knows that his leading men are what will sell the picture. Thus, we get lots of lingering close-ups that let us luxuriously stroll across every inch of Damon's and Affleck's faces. Never has hetero been so well packaged for gay viewers. Thanks, Gus!\r\n\r\nPOST-REVIEW 05/06/10: I was right about the Oscar for screenplay! But the real surprise for me was Robin Williams' Oscar win. While I'm happy his talents finally earned him a gold statue, I still have to 'deduct points' from his performance and the film for his really uneven and often just-plain-wrong Boston accent. I'd rather they have just nixed the dialect altogether. It is not unusual for an educated professor/lecturer to acquire a Standard Midwestern dialect. Forgive my nit-pickiness, but I'm native Bostonian, and a dialect actor. : )",

I don't really care to see movies I Don't know much about but I decided to give this one a try none the less.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up in a few words, I was Blown away.\r\n\r\nFrom the acting to The Oscar winning screenplay this movie will touch you in a truly unique way. The movie starts of with Will Hunting (Matt Damon) going through is ordinary day to day life, which is filled with hanging round with his buddies, his part time job as a janitor and brutally beating up jerks. Although is high intelligence is apparent and shown through all this you can't help but wonder whats really wrong with this troubled genius. So after the Math professor of the collage catches him solving some the impossible sums he set for his class, he decides to bail him out from prison (kicking a cop in the crouch will get you there pretty quickly no matter how smart you are). So Will is bailed only under certain conditions which are that he must attained a weekly math class with the professor and meet a psychiatrist twice a week. Although the math classes are working out well, Will is convinced the does not need a psychiatrist and makes sure that all best possible options turn tale and head out the door. Thus the professor his forced to go to his former collage room-mate for help. This is where me meet Robin Williams in his Oscar winning role of a troubled psychiatric with his own troubled past.\r\n\r\nThis is where the movie lingers on and has we try do go deeper into Will thoughts we find more and more about the other people in his life whom he seems to have a profound effect on. Something people will notice is how Will's problems in his life are not so much different than ours and with Gus Van Sant's brilliantly simply direction it is shown with more heart than you can handle. As Will goes through problems with his love life, his past and what his future hold for him, we realize his life his a potential that all our lives should be. Apart from this each character is superbly distinguished as each play a different role in Will's life which is one of the many fine touches of the screenplay. This movie is almost all dialogue and the dialogue is pretty heavy most times thus not making it appealing to everyone's taste (which movie really is) but I highly recommend it as it one of the few movies that by the end of it you'll either smile or cry because you will look back at your life in truly different way.",
