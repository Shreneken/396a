The film is directed by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Edward Furlong. It is the perfect sequel to the original Terminator film, and in many ways, surpasses it.\n\nOne of the things that makes this film so great is the incredible special effects. The T-1000, played brilliantly by Robert Patrick, is a liquid metal terminator that can morph into any shape it desires. The visual effects used to bring this character to life are truly groundbreaking, and still hold up even today.",

            "content": "Terminator 2: Judgment Day is not only one of the greatest sequels ever made but one of the greatest movies of all time. Released in 1991, directed by James Cameron, and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Edward Furlong, it is a masterpiece of science fiction and action that has stood the test of time.\n\nThe film is set in a future where machines have taken over the world and are trying to wipe out the remaining human resistance. In a desperate attempt to change the future, a reprogrammed Terminator model-101 (Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance, from an advanced Terminator model T-1000 (Robert Patrick) sent to kill him and is almost infinitely more complex than the Terminator model-101. The T-1000 has the ability to imitate any human it touches, which makes it a way more formidable opponent giving the viewer a constant feeling of \"Is that who we think it is?\". This one aspect alone makes way for some groundbreaking storytelling and situations. Especially for the time it was released.\n\nTerminator 2 is a perfect blend of action, suspense, and character development. The special effects, especially for their time, were amazing and still hold up well today! But what really sets this movie apart is its emotional depth. The relationship between John and the Terminator is a highlight of the film, as the machine learns to understand and care for humanity. The performances by Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Furlong are exceptional, adding depth and nuance to their characters.\n\nThe movie's themes are timeless and universal, exploring the nature of humanity, sacrifice, and the consequences of our actions. It is a thrilling and intense ride that never lets up, with some of the most iconic and memorable scenes in movie history, such as the chase on the freeway and the final showdown in the factory.\n\nIn conclusion, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves its place in the pantheon of great movies. It's not just a great sequel but a great movie, period. It has everything you could ask for in a film - action, suspense, emotional depth, and memorable characters. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible!",

No podemos olvidar que esta fue la primera pel\u00edcula de Edward Furlong como actor y justo en ese momento alcanzo la fama siendo recordado como John Connor. Linda encarna a una Sarah Connor bastante fuerte a la perfecci\u00f3n llevando el arco argumental del personaje a otro nivel. Arnold desde luego se queda con toda la atenci\u00f3n al ser ya en el momento y una gran estrella de acci\u00f3n. Robert Patrick como el T-1000 ha sido el mejor trabajo de toda su carrera y siempre ser\u00e1 recordado por eso. La banda sonora de Brad Fiedel le da mucha vida al film. La direcci\u00f3n de James Cameron es impecable en comparaci\u00f3n que la entrega anterior. Los efectos especiales de Stan Winston no se quedan atr\u00e1s y la animaci\u00f3n digital  le ha dado mucha vida al T-1000 convirti\u00e9ndolo en uno de los mejores villanos del cine. Esta pel\u00edcula pudo haberle dado un buen cierre a la saga aunque por la avaricia de los productores no fue posible, pero aun as\u00ed es una excelente pel\u00edcula tanto del g\u00e9nero de acci\u00f3n como de ciencia ficci\u00f3n. Mi nota final para esta pel\u00edcula es un 10/10.",

There are very few 90's action movies and rated \"R\" movies that I'll ever watch, but this movie does both of those things correctly. With a story that's perfectly made and follows the events from the first movie and turns the T-800 into the hero instead of the villain, visuals that may be outdated today, but still gives me the heebie-jeebies whenever I see the T-1000, and characters that make the story even better to relate to (especially with the role of John Conner in this movie), I think that this has to be not only the best Terminator movie ever made, but as a stand-alone movie, it still works great!

Whilst the effects are obviously with that nineties style, with rear projection and early CGI, they are still incredibly impressive and have that tangible reality to them that elevates them beyond modern CGI-only effects. The sound design is also excellent, memorable and pretty-much faultless. The writing is fantastic and this is what, combined with the groundbreaking effects, elevates this to be a truly timeless classic. The acting and characters contribute to the story and effects. It's not one aspect that is good, it is all aspects of this film. I even like the 3D conversion they did, it gave us another way to watching this classic. The story really builds on the first film. The action is exciting. The pacing perfect. Shame James Cameron's newer films are not as good, along with Aliens (1986) this is the peak of his career in my opinion. It's an awesome action film, the likes of which only come many years apart. Everything about it is totally kickass brilliant.",

Tivemos tamb\u00e9m #Matrix #Avatar e entre este 3 dois deles tem o diretor @JamesCameron ele n\u00e3o ter vencido o #Oscar em Avatar foi uma das maiores erros. Mas estamos aqui para falar do #Exterminador Quando assisti ele 1991 quando tinha meus 19 anos, foi uma das atra\u00e7\u00f5es vividas. Ver os efeitos especiais com todo aquele realismo, a persegui\u00e7\u00e3o do caminh\u00e3o atr\u00e1s da moto, ver os efeitos do #T1000 como merc\u00fario em todo filme, a parte que ele se transfoma de uma pessoa a outra ou a parte que ele ultrapassa a grade e a arma enrosca ou a parte dos tiros de 12 que ele recebe ou quando ele explode ou quando ele fica todo congelado e explode em peda\u00e7os que depois se recomp\u00f5e. A persegui\u00e7\u00e3o no carro e o caminh\u00e3o. Tanta a\u00e7\u00e3o em uma \u00e9poca que ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e1vamos acostumados a isso, sem deixar a o telespectador respirar. A atua\u00e7\u00e3o da Linda como uma mulher \"louca, fora de controle\" merecia um oscar pela sua atua\u00e7\u00e3o e seu filho Edward merecia como ator ou Robert Patrick como coadvante. Mesmo assim levaram 6 estatuetas. Arnold com seu estilo #BadBoy principalmente no inicio, quando pega a roupa mais os \u00f3culos e a moto e a frase que esta gravado para historia \"ATE LA VISTA BABY\" #atelavistababy e as maquiagens e um final emocionante que fez pessoas chorarem no final. Um filme de grandes emo\u00e7\u00f5es. Que tamb\u00e9m que trouxe foi o ator Joe Morton e sua fam\u00edlia. Realmente um filme que marca gera\u00e7\u00f5es. Houve alguns filmes da saga sem pe e sem cabe\u00e7a, Arnold poderia ter mais carinho. Com certeza o mehor filme de toda a saga, depois vem o 1\u00ba.\nRoteiro e enredo perfeitos. De tirar o folego.\nVale apena assistir? Com certeza um dos divisores de \u00e1gua de #Hollywood\nNota: 10",

There are bone chilling moments during this movie, especially seeing a nuclear bomb drop on Los Angeles, and seeing LA as a pile of ash and rubble at the start.  Linda Hamilton did an amazing job playing the emotions of her disturbed character.  I believed both her anger and sorrow.  Robert Patrick is amazing as the T1000, and it also makes me laugh how much both his voice and look remind me of Charlie Sheen.  It was fun to revisit this one.

            "content": "The original Terminator film is one of the greatest films of the action genre, and still holds up as a fantastic film, not just of its genre but in general too. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.\n\nHere in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects, they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all, here the effects are stunning, the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully, maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film., and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron, and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts, more so than the original, while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense, without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth, the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun, beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.\n\nLinda Hamilton gives another terrific performance, that is more depth than her performance in the first film, Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.\n\nIn conclusion, a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original, and the only one that's above good level. For me, if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal, in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Truly the most thrilling action movie I've seen in ages.\n\nDirector James Cameron's sci-fi action-thriller sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) may be as good, if not more exciting than The Terminator (1984). I love how moody James Cameron's direction looks and feels. The entire Terminator 2 has a blue color palette that's lovely to look at with bright white lights to illuminate the shadows. Cinematographer Adam Greenberg's wide shots are pretty, but it's his hypnotic close-up and medium shots of Linda Hamilton's pensive Sarah Connor in the quieter moments that look the best. All the angles and perspectives really allow for the new CGI to show off crazy things Robert Patrick's T-1000 villain can do. Terminator 2 looks amazing decades later with effects that are not dated.\n\nCameron's direction is all killer, no filler with plenty of bloody shootouts, intense chases, and funny one liners. It's basically one long chase sequence as Linda Hamilton's heroine Sarah Connor and Edward Furlong's John Connor are being chased by Robert Patrick's shape-shifting robot assassin Terminator serial number T-1000. His liquid metal body allows for insane bullet soaking and outrageously fun sequences that make him a relentless villain like Arnold in the first Terminator film. Seeing him kill the night shift guard is still shocking and entertaining. Arnold casually tossing people around like The Terminators is really like a logical conclusion to Hal 3000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey if he had a body, complete with red eyes. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a fabulously crafted film and an exhilarating action-thriller movie for the ages.\n\nThere's really clever thought put into the robotic movements, groundbreaking visual effects, and violent action to entertain us from writers James Cameron and William Wisher. That first encounter when you think Arnold's Terminator is still the villain about to shoot John Connor, then he unveils his shotgun from the roses to unload into The T-1000 instead is one of cinema's coolest moments. Immediately, followed by The T-1000 healing and reforming his liquid metal body back to normal after being repeatedly shot. The slick writing for Terminator 2 breaks down the rules for T-1000's morphing due to its poly-alloy into him changing due to liquid metal is very easy for audiences to follow. I love lines like Arnold saying \"Your foster parents are dead.\" It's a clever script with nifty sci-fi ideas for The Terminator, earnest understanding for John Connor, and redemption for Sarah Connor. It's more about humanizing Arnold's Terminator and getting to cool action rather than an original sci-fi concept, but Terminator 2 works.\n\nMaking The T-1000 a cop in appearance was deliberate as social commentary on James Cameron's part. John Connor's step-parents blindly trusting Robert Patrick's cop, even though he's a killer, just because he looks like a police officer is brilliant commentary. Every adult and kid just Thinking about how police get away with murder or crimes because of their powerful status in society and position of authority is interesting. It's so funny watching Arnold mess with the cops in T2. Besides the corporation of Skynet producing Terminators as the robots that destroy humanity for profit motives is a neat critique of capitalism. The psychologist not listening to Sarah Connor despite knowing a man massacred the entire police station in the first Terminator really hits home about how flawed the mental health facilities are in the United States. Sarah's \"How were you supposed to know?\" speech is a brilliant criticism of the ethics of scientific advances that can cause ruination.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is fantastic as the fearsome Terminator. Now even funnier and kinder as he assumes a father figure role for John Connor. Arnold looks cool and effortless as he kills or tosses people around, but it's his serious performance that feels so touching and timeless.\n\nLinda Hamilton is very captivating, pensive, sympathetic, and cool as heroine Sarah Connor. She shoots guns like Arnold and gives a moving and profound performance as a revolutionary against machines, mother to a future leader, and heroine against violent forces. Her narration and expressive acting are remarkable in Terminator 2.\n\nEdward Furlong is likable and funny as John Connor. I appreciate how thoughtful he feels even as a child actor. There's a lot of responsibility on John, and Furlong depicts his conflicted feelings naturally. Robert Patrick is eerie and entertaining as the relentless T-1000. His crazy running and subtle expressions do feel like a killer robot might make them as they search onwards for their dreaded mission.\n\nEditors Mark Goldblatt, Richard A. Harris, and Conrad Buff IV shove violent action scene after scene in your face with a breakneck pace, so you never notice Terminator 2 is 137 minutes long until the credits roll. Production designer Joseph C. Nemec III makes labs, trucks, and factories that look realistic with an industrial feel. Joseph P. Lucky, Charles William Breen, and Gary Diamond's art direction creates striking imagery like the nuclear bomb explosion to the T-1000's endless transformations and injures like he's The Thing. John M. Dwyer and Carole Lee Cole's set decoration has natural 1991 furniture and props, but especially with a gritty industrial look of metal everywhere.\n\nVisual effects artists Dennis Muren, Doug Chiang, Alison Savitch, Janet Healy, Leslie Huntley, Gene Warren Jr., and Andrew Kennedy steals the show with groundbreaking and creative usage of CGI. The CGI does not look dated to me like so many early visual effects done on computers. Having practical miniatures when possible and CGI for when the T-1000 melts down or through objects is pretty creative and balanced. CGI really should only be used sparingly like in Terminator 2.\n\nComposer Brad Fiedel's thudding synth score has beautiful melodies and hectic suspense within his exciting score. Even in 1991, synths in scores sounded wonderful. Sound designers Gary Rydstrom, Gloria S. Borders, Tom Johnson, Richard Hymns, Tim Holland, Teresa Eckton, Ethan van der Ryn, Robert Shoup, Ken Fischer, E. Larry Oatfield, Gary Summers, Kevin Rose-Williams, and John Rotondi come up with all sorts of neat noises. From flesh ripping off the Terminator's arm or the T-1000 transforming from liquid to solid. The nuclear explosion sounds massive.\n\nMarlene Stewart gives Arnold a killer black leather ensemble, but it's Marlene's outfits for Linda Hamilton that impressed me the most. Her black combat gear looks so sexy, practical, fitting, and fashionable on her. Make-up artists Ed French, Jeff Dawn, and Steve LaPorte gave Linda Hamilton neat hairstyles and a nice natural look that makes her stand out.\n\nIn all, Terminator 2 is a fun blast and highly influential. You can see in every scene where some other movie found influence for the characters, story, or an action set piece. Think about Mr. Smith taking over bodies in The Matrix and compare that to The T-1000's morphing and impersonations. What a film.",

            "content": "The first movie to list as one of my all-time favorites is Terminator 2: Judgement Day. With the super-strong director James Cameron controlling the science fiction movies he is good at, and with the advancement of animation special effects technology, there is no need to care about the small flaws in the movies. The most exciting is the action scene between Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 and Robert Patrick's T-1000, where guns obviously only have the effect of stopping or slowing down the enemy team. Superstar actor Linda Hamilton presents the character and aspirations of Sarah Connor with her near-perfect acting skills. There is also a super surprise, that is, John Connor (Sarah Connor's son) played by the young Edward Furlong, and the father-son relationship derived from the T-800 is absolutely tear-jerking at the last moment. The above four characters collide with sparks with each other, and they were very clearly shaped. The shuttle between the present and the future by a time machine also means futurism. The worries caused by technology are bound to be checked by human beings earlier, so as to avoid irreversible consequences. It's really rare to have such a wonderful and well-organized story paired with intense and shocking action scenes, and no one can deny that it is a legend. To say it's a great popcorn movie, yes; to say it's a serious exploration of the educational implications of technology, yes. Undoubtedly, it propelled James Cameron to the status of a legendary director. Terminator 2: Judgement Day, I love you.",

            "content": "The original Terminator film is one of the greatest films of the action genre, and still holds up as a fantastic film, not just of its genre but in general too. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.\n\nHere in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects, they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all, here the effects are stunning, the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully, maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film., and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron, and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts, more so than the original, while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense, without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth, the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun, beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.\n\nLinda Hamilton gives another terrific performance, that is more depth than her performance in the first film, Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.\n\nIn conclusion, a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original, and the only one that's above good level. For me, if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal, in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "An absolutely amazing and timeless film packed with so much content and heart. This film is the pinnacle of 'intelligent' action and story telling in an action film driven by story and it's characters. A movie that gets so much right; an action movie with purpose. In telling the story and building it's world, nothing goes to waste. Every action, every gunshot, every explosion, every character interaction has intricate value.\n\nThe action isn't just eye candy or effects for the sake of it, but an important means by which to clue us into characters, motivations and their capabilities. Two Terminators grappling isn't just a hero and a villain fighting for control, it's the moment our expectations are subverted - the bigger machine isn't necessarily the strongest. As a vehicle sustains damage it only further demonstrates the ruthless persistence of the villain as we see it unblinkingly push aside the wreckage of it's own vehicle the same as with it's own impactful driving. Action with substance, that sells the characters embroiled in in intense action.\n\nThis is a movie about humanity. A movie in which Sarah has set aside her own humanity in anticipation and response to a looming machine threat, prepared to do whatever it ruthlessly takes to avert Judgment Day. A movie in which a machine programmed to protect and follow orders begins to understand what it means to be human. And at the center of it is John, a character who finds his purpose and place in the world, taught by Sarah in preparation for the future but becoming the heart of the film and to those around him.\n\nThe actors deserve a tonne of praise. Linda Hamilton as the intense haunted Sarah. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the stoic machine becoming the increasingly humanised 'Uncle Bob' figure. Edward Furlong's transformation from a bratty kid to (as stated) becoming the central figure and heart of the film. Robert Patrick's efforts in bringing the sleek efficient cold T-1000 to life, unflinching, unwavering and determined to accomplish it's mission. Even Earl Boen's performance as detestable Dr Silberman makes for a satisfying side-villain to the larger plot.\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest strengths of the movie comes from the fact that (despite it's length) it feels a complete and satisfying experience from start to finish. So much happens during the run time, but it never feels like a slog. An  element T2 Judgment Day does so well is convey the scope of 'what's at stake', managing it's use of threats and obstacles that the core characters face very well - the T-1000 isn't the point of the film in itself, and yet feels entirely relevant even if not present the entire time. \n\nThe movie soundtrack composed by Brad Fiedel is also extremely memorable, providing important flavour for the many memorable moments and for representing the characters, from the metallic heart-beat like clanging sound of the T-800, to the haunting noises accompanying the creepy unnerving T-1000. \n\nThe film is absolute must see and complete experience.",

The best actress that year was Jodie Foster in \u2018Silence of the Lambs', another \u2018strong' female lead. I love \u2018Lambs', but the emotional and physical transformations between Jodie Foster's character and Linda Hamilton's character are incomparable. \n\nJodie Foster was calm and composed in her male-dominated field (FBI). It was a fine performance, but Hamilton changed her entire body for T2. In addition, her character was suffering from insanity, trauma and conflict. From the scenes when Hamilton is just staring into space to her one handed shotgun reload, her performance covers the entire gambit. \n\nThe best supporting actress that year was Mercedes Ruehl in \u2018The Fisher King'. Does anyone remember that movie or even who Mercedes Ruehl is? Other nominations were Jessica Tandy for \u2018Fried Green Tomatoes', Dianne Ladd for \u2018Rambling Rose' and Kate Nelligan for \u2018The Prince of Tides'.\n\nDoes anyone under 50 know who these actresses are or ever heard of the movies? The academy had the perfect opportunity to support a truly strong and complex female character and instead threw the award away. Really\u2026 Mercedes Ruehl?

Those issues aside, they're small enough, but they kind of bothered me. Nitpicks aside, the plot made sense if you ignore the time paradoxes, and the characters were amazing. John Connor, despite being only ten years old, is a great lead character, and Edward Furlong's acting is brilliant, by both child acting standards, and acting standards in general. Linda Hamilton also demonstrates an amazing transformation from the first movie, and Arnold Schwarzenegger goes from stoic killing machine to a self-aware machine that learns what it means to be human. The visual effects hold up great, with one or two nitpicks I won't emphasize. It all enhances the story where it's used, only adding to the T-1000's threat. The pulse pounding soundtrack, and great dynamic between John and the T-800 add to the spectacular action set pieces, all of which are the primary elements that hold it up to this day, as well as its theme of the future being yours to write.",

The action is exciting and suspenseful with that motorcycle chase being the standout and that twist with Arnold's character being our Kyle Reese in this movie is brilliant! Speaking of brilliant, this movie somehow got me emotionally invested into a cyborg whether it was T-800's beautiful relationship with John as well as his sacrifice in the end, showing that while he's a cyborg, he has a ton of emotion in his heart. Sarah becomes a badass in this movie and I love the mother-son bond with John.

Even though I'm sure everyone has seen it, it's a good chance to reassure yourselves that the Terminator films were once groundbreaking cinema, as well as being great films. Although Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines (2003) is nowhere near as bad as people seem to remember it being, that is when the series should have shut down. Terminator: Genisys (2015) is bizarrely named, and it's bizarre that it exists, but at least there was an idea somewhere there, lost amongst the rubble. Terminator: Dark Fate (2019) I can't explain at all. I went in thinking this is the moment I might see another half decent Terminator, but sadly not. Terminator 2 however, is the high bar that every sci-fi film should aim for. The effects still look astounding today, you believe in all the characters, and the switch of Schwarzenegger's Terminator from bad to good for the second film is the stroke of genius that makes it work. It's still probably James Cameron's best film.",

            "content": "Terminator 2: Judgement Day - 10/10. James Cameron's sci-fi masterpiece celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, and the movie just keeps getting better as it ages. Cameron delivered the cult classic The Terminator in 1984, which ended up launching the careers of himself, Linda Hamilton, and of course the biggest action star the world will soon to see, Arnold Schwarzenegger. So when he decided to do a sequel, 7 years later, a lot of people were wondering how and what he will do. Not only was the sequel the biggest budgeted film of all time till that date, but it upped the stakes both scope and story wise. Never have we seen a small budget film get a huge increase in production for its sequel, but considering Cameron's ascent to mega director status, Carolco decided to take a chance and give the director complete creative/financial freedom. The end result was an R rated, cold and bombastic sci-fi action film that would raise the genre to new heights, and raise the CGI bar even higher (before Jurassic Park elevated CGI to the highest stratosphere possible). T2 is a perfect example of allowing a director to tell their story and allow them to craft it in a way that would really show their flair and trademarks in storytelling. What Cameron did was really raise the bar on the apocalyptic stakes that were introduced in the first film. With the money he was able to literally show the fire and destruction of what could happen if Skynet was able to go with their plans. It really hits you hard as a viewer and makes you understand that this film is not gonna hold back. He elevates the Sarah Connor character, making Hamilton give the best performance of her career as the now jaded and determined Connor, whose screen presence is off the charts. Arnold as the T1000 is amazing because Cameron directs him to his strengths: being a physical mammoth whose cold dialogue delivery matches the robot character. Robert Patrick as the villain is also cool, bringing an agile and malleable threat to the characters. But what I appreciate the most about this film is its message of easing on the reliance of tech. A message that is important to this day than it was 3 decades ago.",

Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is one of his better ones and I think he perfectly transitions himself from a killer machine we feared like he is in the first one, to the guy we all wish we had as a friend. I really like the first film, however, I like this film even more. I can't find a single thing wrong with it.

The terminators don't voluntary \"chat\", they more vomit exposition dialogue.\n\nWhile I'll always remember this as a great movie, it isn't without its flaws.

The characters are emotionally affecting and relatable - the ending sealed the depth about what humanity is all about. And while there is a nonstop actions stunts to thrill viewers, I also enjoyed its core story about the value of human life. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong were unforgettable trio lead here - you'll be attached to their adventure here. Even the cyborg antagonist Robert Patrick was commendable here. This is highly recommended classic sci-fi action!",

            "content": "It never occurred to me before, but T2 is really an archetypal \"A Boy and His Dog\" story along the lines of \"Old Yeller\" or \"Pete's Dragon\" or \"ET: The Extraterrestrial.\" I'll assume anyone reading this has already seen the movie, so spoilers ahead. Arnold Schwarzenegger was a huge star when this sequel was made, so this time he HAD to be the hero of the film, this time becoming the protector of a young John Connor, who is being hunted by a more advanced Terminator model played to perfection by Robert Patrick with cold animal-like predatory menace. The \"Boy and His Dog\" story starts fairly quickly, as a young John Connor befriends the futuristic killer cyborg. Connor teaches him tricks (i.e. that car keys are often under sun visors and, of course, \"Hasta la vista, baby\"), the boy and his pet Terminator save each other at different points in the film, and in the end John has to give his beloved Terminator a sad farewell that's every bit as touching as when the boy  in \"Old Yeller\" says to his mama \"Listen. Old Yeller just saved your life and Elizabeth's, too. And he saved mine and Arliss'. We can't. We don't know for certain. I'll pen him up where he can't get out. A-and then we'll wait. We could not shoot up like he was nothing. Don't you understand?\" Or when Elliott in \"E.T.\" tells his pet alien \"You could be happy here, I could take care of you. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together, E.T.\" And in T2, it's every bit as touching when the Terminator tells John there is another Cyberdyne chip that must also be destroyed, to which John replies, \"No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us! Don't do it.  Please... don't go --\" with tears streaming down his face. So my point here is that you pair the durable \"Boy and His Dog\" story with wildly exciting and muscular action courtesy of director/co-writer James Cameron (man, do I wish he'd make a straight-up non-preachy action film again ALA \"The Terminator\" or \"Aliens\") and strong performances by Patrick as the T-1000, Edward Furlong as the young John Connor, and particularly Linda Hamilton as the fierce and buffed our tiger mom, Sarah Connor, you have a movie that's pretty irresistible. The CGI does seem fairly primitive at times, but most of it surprisingly holds up with the mix of practical and CGI when displaying the T-1000's knives and stabbing weapons. If I did have a complaint upon rewatching T2, it's that the sequel shifted too greatly in tone from the original, relying too much on one-liners and comedic elements. Admittedly, the one-liners are good and the comedy is genuinely funny, but the hard edge of the original is what makes that first film easily the best in the series. Still, sequels of this era had a penchant for radical shifts in tone and story (i.e. \"Mad Max\" to the \"The Road Warrior\" or \"First Blood\" to \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\"). Overall, although T2 takes a major shift in the direction of family-friendly with the \"A Boy and His Dog\" storyline, but the characters, story, and especially the action are brilliant and impossible not to enjoy.",

Still mesmerizing to watch after all of these years. In the summer of 1991, the sequel was truly an event. And in 2020, it's easy to understand why the subsequent movies simply couldn't come close to measuring up and why they were met with outright disdain from many fans. The franchise should have ended with T2. I still wonder about the potential of a James Cameron-helmed third movie in 1993 or 1994 with the trio of leading actors returning. Commercially, it likely would have been huge. The anticipation and expectations also would have been enormous. But it wasn't meant to be. T2 undoubtedly could never be topped or even equaled.

            "content": "This in my opinion is the best terminator movie for a few reasons including having a really light hearted fun terminator adjusting to human life, more amazing practical effects and more emotions. The first amazing thing is the terminators lets first talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as a terminator but this time having him be light hearted and learning humans which comes to one of my favourite scenes in the film where Arnold takes a closer look at a toddler, the other terminator who I call Austin is a great villain for the film posing as an actual threat for our characters. Again like the previous film has great practical effects in my opinion that are better than the first terminator as some of the action scenes would be hard to create with green screens and SFX. I think the links and references to the first film are amazing. Another amazing part of the film is the emotions from Sarah Connor wanting to see her son and the ending scene. Also the dread you fell is scary and really makes you want them to stop Judgement Day. In conclusion this in my opinion is a perfect film for all of the reasons I have explained so all in all this is in my top 10 films of all time.\n\nJust to say thank you for all the people who read my movie reviews I really do appreciate it. Thank you so much.",

            "content": "The original Terminator is one of the most intense sci-fi/action movies I've ever seen. T2 is not nearly as thrilling and suspenseful as the original. And that's why I found this sequel, which considered to be even superior to the original, slightly underwhelming. The action set-pieces are almost as good as those in the first movie, and due to the the fact that this one has a massively higher budget, the action sequences feel even more well-shot. The visual effects look fantastic, and surprisingly still hold up pretty well. But the problem isn't about the action nor the CGI; it's about the situations and the conditions here that couldn't make me worry about the characters as I should. Even at its climax, the intensity pale in comparison to that's I felt whenever a car chase or a small fighting scene come in the original.\n\nAnother issue I have with this movie is that it drags a little bit at its second act. I don't mean it gets boring at all, but it feels a bit devoid and empty halfway through. Maybe better storytelling could have fixed that. I also have a couple of nitpicks, but I can't say they hindered my experience of watching the movie.\n\nThat said, James Cameron doubled down almost every single aspect in the story and the characters to make a new extremely taut story that expanded the characters' arc like I've never seen before in any film. The dialogue between the three main characters and even the story itself revealed that the characters, humans or cyborgs, have extra more layers into them. Even the villain is effortlessly well-rounded, and he oozes the impressive development Cameron has made in this world, that of course in addition to the fact that Robert Patrick is quite intimidating and so iconic as T-1000.\n\nThere is nothing can top what have been already said about Linda Hamelton's character, Sarah Connor, which definitely deserves its place among the absolute best female characters ever appeared on the silver screen. With that being said, I prefer to praise the astonishing chemistry between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong as the titular cyborg and John Connor, respectively. From the spot-on jokes and funny one-liners to the surprisingly moving and heartwarming scenes the two characters shared, the dynamic between these two endearing characters is simply unmatchable! Furlong is sadly a wasted talent that proved in this movie and American History X that he has a grand range and monumental acting abilities. Here he walked a very thin line between being an imprudent, reckless teen and an innocent child to bring out a likable, relatable, and quite convincing character.\n\nJudgment Day is undoubtedly one of the best sequels ever made, but in my opinion it didn't surpass the original, nor even reach its level. That's in large part due to its relative lack of suspense that's arguably the best merit the original has.\n\n(8/10)",

Back in the day when you could have a strong female lead without all the \"hey, look at me I'm an all-powerful girl!!!\" hype behind it, just a cool female character in a well-done action movie. The was a lot of humour thrown in which also made the movie very enjoyable. By today's standards, the effects are common, however, back then, all of that shape-shifting CGI was cutting edge and other than possibly \"The Abyss\" if I remember correctly, no other movie had ever done this kind of shape-shifting effect before, and definitely not all the way through the movie like this one. 5/5 for being what a sci fi action movie should be and throwing in a lot of humour too.",

The first Terminator is a bit overrated nowadays IMO likely due to technological advancements but oh my God, was this sequel amazing. It was released in 1991, but the special effects are as stunning to this very day as the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. A mixture of CGI and regular practical effects and it's still pleasing to the eye. I completely agree with Jeremy of CinemaSins' statement about how the effects were a lot better than the ones we have nowadays. From what I heard, some of the effects weren't even CGI despite what their visual appearance would suggest. The T1000 is an intimidating villain who is a guy you should run away from really fast because of his sword-hands, ability to blend in with the floor and look like your long-lost twin if you're the same size (FUN FACT: Those were actual twins in the scene with the guard). Unlike the first film, the R rating is justified here. Arnold Schwarzenneger is awesome in this movie as he becomes one of the good guys. The action sequences are great, even better than the first. Sarah Connor evolves from the first film from a damsel in distress who will become a great leader into a badass action girl. I also found the movie to be deep at heart as I was really invested into how John taught the T800 human things as the T800 learns the value of human life. One of the most genuine bonds I have seen in ages. In many ways, T2 succeeds where the first film failed.",

Edward Furlong was also really good and I really liked his relationship with The Terminator who I'll talk about in a sec. Now onto the T-1000 who was a great and menacing Villian played Brilliantly by Robert Patrick I loved how he was an advanced prototype that made  him almost unbeatable. Now onto The Terminator played again by Arnold Schwarzenegger I liked how james Cameron turned him from a great villian to a great hero and to be honest I actually prefer the hero one reason being is that I said I really like the chemistry between him and young John Conner their relationship was funny heartwarming and also unexpectedly emotional. Obviously the Special Effects were Revolutionary at the time and still to this day hold up Extremely well. A phenomenal film that actually gets better and better as I watch it every time.

The sequel, according to Linda Hamilton's Wikipedia page is scheduled for 2021.\n\nAs I watched T:2 over the weekend, I noticed something rather odd about the T-1000. When he was shot, blown up, and later melted in a pool of molten steel. He had no wiring or electrical components.\n\nIf he was truly a robot, cyborg, or android, then he would have had to have these components in order to function. Even in the end of the movie when his body was blasted open with a grenade launcher and his insides were exposed, there was no wiring or electrical components. This factor combined with his abilities to shape-shift and regenerate leads me to believe that this was no ordinary robot.\n\nThe T-1000's extraordinary composition and abilities lead me to believe that he was an alien and not a robot.\n\nI believe that the 2021 sequel to T:2 should explore the possibilities of alien involvement in the creation of Skynet, and in the operations of Skynet, in the \"Terminator\" universe.",

Linda Hamilton plays a super tough Sarah Connor opposed to the super unbuff Sarah from the first film and she's awesome. Edward Furlong is great as John Connor, the future leader of the resistance. Let's not forget Robert Patrick as the T-1000, the main villain of the film. He's so cool in this film. This film has amazing cinematography and a great score. There are so many great moments in this film; Hasta La Vista Baby, The Truck Chase, The \"Get Down\" scene. So many great moments. A true masterpiece gem of action flicks.

            "content": "T2: Judgment day came out seven years after the original. The original was a very good and unique sci-fi horror movie that just so happened to be an action film, but the second in the franchise has the better movie, a better story, better action, better. everything. Sarah Connor is in prison because she has been wrongfully accused of being crazy due to her belief of the Terminator which tried to kill her in the first film. Her son, John Connor (Edward Furlong in his first role) is in foster care with awful parents, but he spends most of his time away from them. In the first film, the T-800 was sent to kill Sarah, but this time, Skynet sends a different terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). A basically indestructible and a more deadly terminator made of liquid metal. T-1000 has the ability to morph into anything and anyone, creating an antagonist to watch out for. He is sent to kill John so that in the future, the resistance would not have a leader. Except, John in the future reprograms the T-800 to go and protect him as a child (11-12 years old I think). Played masterfully by Schwarzenegger himself. Let me start off by saying that this movie is perfect, not a single flaw. Everything that was great about the first movie is multiplied several times to an extent of being THE best action film that will ever be made. It was an interesting twist to see the antagonist from the first film being one of the three protagonists in this one. I'm sure we can all agree that Arnold is a cooler hero than a villain. The king of sci-fi action, James Cameron, is back directing this one as well. I think he did a better job making this one. He brought a deep, emotional relationship between the T-800 and John Connor that was a very heartfelt and believable concept. Not to mention some of the best visuals ever put to the big screen that revolutionized the movie industry in a huge way. It was very influential and it still holds up extremely well. The action scenes are arguably the best ever put to screen. All of them were noticeably practical. As many have said: You don't need extreme violence to make effective action.\nOver all, T2 without a doubt, surpassed the original. It is the best sequel ever made, one of the best sci-fi films ever made, the best action film ever...\n\nheck with it, it's one of the best movies ever made period. 5/5 stars",

First the action is phenomenal, even though this film came out in the 90s it had good action and not the cheesy kind in the matrix. Yes the special effects for the metal terminator did suck and were cheesy you just have to remember it's an old movie. Now the plot and that Arnold is not longer a bad guy terminator but now is a good nice reprogrammed terminator protecting a  young John Connor. I like that Arnold's the good guy but who cares who's he plays better they're both really good. So yeah the plot, old John Connor sends a good Arnold to protect his younger self so that the metal terminator doesn't murder the fudge out of him with that little finger of his. I just like the plot, it's simple and not too complicated like alien where you have to pin point everything. Now finally the ending, if your reading this you should have already seen this movie so spoilers, good terminator dies and he dies with a thumbs up oh and the metal terminator dies too but who cares, it's all about Arnold, nobody else. My thumb is up. Now the bad, that kid was annoying, that's why I put a half star.",

            "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the special achievement that you all been waiting for, the sequel to the first film, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Well, here it is, the sequel to The Terminator directed by James Cameron. It won 4 Oscars at the Academy Awards. One for Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup. It was the highest grossing film of 1991 making up to $519 million over $102 million budget. How unbelievable is that? With Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor narrating having his son John Connor become the Human Resistance leader against Skynet - the artificial intelligence that will be given control of the United States' nuclear missiles and initiate a nuclear holocaust called ''Judgment Day'' on August 1997. But this film came out in 1991 so there's no way that'll happen in real life. Sarah was arrested and imprisoned at a mental hospital after attempting to bomb a computer factory. So why didn't it show about what happened back there? Why didn't it show about what happened after she got pregnent to John Connor and she got arrested? Oh well. Anyways, Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as The Terminator, this time a good guy. He went to the bar, wore somebody's clothes, took some sun glasses and ride off into the motorcycle. But then, a new terminator called T-1000 played by Robert Patrick is sent back in time to assassinate John Connor but was confronted by The Terminator who is sent back in time to protect John Connor. You can see why The Terminator is the second terminator and he become good because the first from the first Terminator movie is evil 'cause Sarah killed it. As the Terminator shoots T-1000, you can see that he is liquid metal. He can go through objects, walk through fire and become different people. The visual effects on T-1000 is absolutely incredible. Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman is a psychiatrist of Sarah Connor. He only had a small from the first film. He sounds like Rex from Toy Story. He sounds so similar than Wallace Shawn. I don't know. I just thought about it years ago. Michael Biehn has a cameo role in this and his acting is brilliant in this where he warns Sarah that John Connor's the target now. The scene where The Terminator and John called the Foster parents and The Terminator can imitate voices and realizing they're already dead. So The Terminator and John breaks Sarah free from the hospital and T-1000. They rescued Sarah and The Terminator says ''Come with me if you want to live.'' Damn, I forgot about that quote from the first Terminator film like what Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese said and The Terminator imitating the voices. I like the scene where Sarah stops Miles Dyson, creator of Skynet played by Joe Morton from letting Judgment Day happen. The Terminator and John arrive at his house and warns him to destroy the items and the designs in Cyberdyne. There's an amazing scene where The Terminator cut his arm and pulls his off  making him realize that he's a cyborg. So they went into the Cyberdyne building to destroy all the stuff and retrieve the CPU and the arm. Miles Dyson get shot and sacrifices himself by exploding the entire building. Now there's no way for him to kill himself because he got shot, I really like him. I really like that scene actually is because he gasping repeatedly and says ''I don't know how much longer I can hold this.'' I use to say that when I was feeling sick years ago. The chase scene and the final battle between The Terminator, Sarah, John and T-1000 is phenomenal. I even love the part where Arnold says ''Hasta la vista, baby.'' The final scene where the Terminator says goodbye to John Connor is actually kinda sad but aside from that he says '' I know now why you cry, but it is something I could never do.'' and  went into the lava and gives John a thumbs up. Many people love this movie just like I do so does my friends Jacob Dimmock, Thomas Raddings and Shannon Walker. Everybody's a huge fan of The Terminator films. I definitely think the first and the second are as good as each other.  Much like from the 1980s, it's not classed as a horror film. It's more than the 80s sci-fi action film much like what James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd did. This movie is kind of long. I think it's 147 mins long.  Not that long though but it's considered be the longest film of the franchise. As far as sequels go, this movie is considered one of the best, most greatest films of all times much like my favorite film The Terminator the first one. But the first Terminator doesn't include at the Oscars it's still one  of the greatest films of all time much like the sequel. From the beauty and the majesty of The Silence of the Lambs and Disney's Beauty and the Beast, this movie is most thrilling, most watchable, most greatest and most high rated movie at all time. In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger: I'm back!",

This extended cut as I like to call it is what I remember enjoying most because it was exclusive when first released on pioneer laserdisc and vhs special edition cuts. The extended footage had some extremely impressive special effects Stan Winston pulled off including using the real life twin of  actor Linda Hamilton. This scene alone was worth the extra money for this cut. Anyway sit back and enjoy an extended cut of your favorite terminator movie :) you won't be disappointed.",

As you would expect from that moment until the end it's nothing but bang, bang shoot'em up, blow'em up, destroy and fight to finish the job. I say A+, 100%, 10/10, 5stars. If you are worried this might be my last review, don't be. Cause, \"I'll Be Back.\" Please leave your comments at RateMyMovieReviews@gmail.com",

            "content": "I was very nervous and anxious when I knew I would be re-watching this film after so many years of it's absence in my life. In many ways I believe I even subconsciously avoided buying it on DVD for this very reason.\n\nI remember how attached to the T-800 (Model 101) I was as a kid, the very real emotions felt at the sight of the T-1000 impaling the T-800 to the floor with that pole, the theme music, then the moment that the T-800 was lowered down into the molten steel. Those feelings and their connection to those moments are what made me hesitate to re-watch this masterpiece for so many years.\n\nIt's no secret to people that know me well that I adore Arnold Schwarzenegger, for me it even goes beyond the average comical value of most of his \"fans.\" \nThe man represents so much more than Hollywood cheese to me. He was my childhood, he represents some kind of father-figure spirit, in many ways he was my first introduction to consistency in cinema and the feeling of homely familiarity that was missing in my unstable upbringing.\n\nBut alas, I finally decided to overcome my ominous feelings towards this film and it's connection to my childhood and I already feel improved as a person for it. Due to so many years between now and my last viewing I had actually forgotten just how epic this film is, both in it's pacing, duration and overall theme.\n\nWhat a script! \n\nJames Cameron and William Wisher really went above and beyond for this film, the script would obviously work well as a book alone, but add on top of that fact the genius practical effects work of Stan Winston and you have a whole different level of a concept's full realisation. Even Industrial Light & Magic's dated yet ahead-of-it's-time CGI holds up and looks quite good. Terminator 2: Judgement Day must have been quite the unforgettable spectacle for those lucky enough to have viewed it on the big screen.\n\nThe soundtrack harnesses a myriad of emotions wonderfully, the stunt work is of high quality, the sets and costumes perfectly set the tone and the actors? All perfect.\nRobert Patrick for example was an amazing villain or especially Linda Hamilton who in my opinion along with Sigourney Weaver have set the bar for heroines so high that everything after their respective performances seem to fall disastrously short. Although, it must be said that Charlize Theron has actually been impressing me lately with Dredd and Mad Max: Fury Road. That's another topic for another time though. \n\nI was glued to the screen for the entire duration, it had it's eerily peaceful moments, it's moments of adrenaline, it's innocent moments and it's very tense moments. In the end, I found my prior opinion that James Cameron's 1984 The Terminator was superior a hard view to stand by. \nBoth have their strengths and weaknesses and both are better served for different moods, so in the end I decided to rate this the same as I rated the previous film in this franchise. \n\nGone are the days when such great elements could come together like this, and I'm sad for that. But then again, this film came out at the same time as some pretty terrible films so perhaps there is hope? Either way, I'm glad I revisited this piece of important personal history that further cemented for me Arnold Schwarzenegger as the greatest actor of all time.\n\n\"Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear. The terminator, would never stop. It would never leave him, and it would never hurt him, never shout at him, or get drunk and hit him, or say it was too busy to spend time with him. It would always be there. And it would die, to protect him. Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up. In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.\"\n\nMasterpiece.",

            "content": "10 years after the events of \"The Terminator,\" Sarah Connor's son, John is now hunted by a Terminator far more advanced than the previous one sent after Sarah in 1984. To counter the sinister AI known as Skynet's attempt at John's life, the human resistance from the future sends back a Terminator of their own to protect John.\n\n\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" is directed by James Cameron and written by James Cameron and William Wisher. Released seven years after the original film, this colossal sequel smashed the box office, and came at the height of Arnold Schwarzenegger's popularity. \"T2\" was a pop culture phenomenon and blew the doors wide open for science fiction and visual effects in the 90s. Without which, we probably wouldn't have films like \"Jurassic Park.\" \n\nStarring Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular character, Linda Hamilton returning an aptly hardened and tortured Sarah Connor, Edward Furlong as the young John Connor, and finally Robert Patrick as the menacing T-1000, \"Terminator 2\" brings its A game with its casting.\n\nLinda Hamilton does an outstanding job as Sarah Connor, and her transformation from the first film is amazing. That's how you do character development! Arnold just pretty much does his thing as the Terminator, and his one-liners are legendary. Edward Furlong is quite annoying, but he is just a kid in \"T2,\" so it's excusable. Lastly (but not not least), Robert Patrick's understated yet sinister performance makes the T-1000 one of the most malicious villain to ever grace the screen. \n\nWith this vast and ambitious sequel, James Cameron pits our protagonists against a villain with twice the power and intellect. This is a chase film, much like its predecessor, but Cameron takes care to infuse \"Terminator 2\" with deep themes like nuclear war, fatalism, and the human condition. The main theme of the film, I think is summed up nicely in the last line: \"If a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.\" I think that's what really makes \"Terminator 2\" great among other science fiction films. There's a human-centric story at the core of it, and the characters are very much important in this film.\n\nThemes aside, James Cameron steers the audience through grand action sequences peppered with car chases, Arnie firing a mini-gun, and giant explosions, and spectacular visual effects that still hold up to this day. Mirroring the first film, \"T2\" does slow down in its second act, but it actually serves a thematic purpose. Rather than shoving exposition down the viewer's throat in one single scene, the film draws out its runtime a bit to dig deeper into the relationships between Sarah, John, and the Terminator.\n\n\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" surpasses the original film with its staggering action, visuals, and rich characters. If you haven't seen \"T2,\" I would very much suggest that you watch it after you read this review--this is probably my favorite film. You can watch \"Terminator 2\" as strictly an action movie, but you can also see it as an examination on what makes us human, and what it takes to connect with one another on a deeper level. \n\n\"The future is not set, there is no fate but what we make for ourselves.\"",

            "content": "Bigger doesn't always mean better, but in the case of \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\" the spectacular sequel to the already spectacular 1984's \"The Terminator,\" such an assumption may actually be suitable.  Though I wouldn't go as far as saying it's better - nothing can compare to the DIY brilliance, ingenious formations of its predecessor - the action is more explosive, the performances mightier, its heart larger, and its drama more burly.  It doesn't improve upon the original, no - it is, rather, an excellent continuation of where things left off, given more budget to fully realize its conceptual periphery and provided with enhanced direction from James Cameron, who, between the gap of the first \"Terminator\" film and its sequel, helmed such classics as \"Aliens\" and \"The Abyss.\" \n\tThe movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, though he isn't the titular villain this time - he's its hero, believe it or not.  \"Judgment Day\" takes place in 1995, where Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has been placed in a mental institution, and where her son, John (Edward Furlong), is now ten-years-old and living with a disinterested foster family.  Following her experiences in the first film, Sarah spent years training John for his supposed future role as a renowned military leader, her being locked up the result of bombing a computer factory.  John, persnickety and rebellious, has taken to the streets, already fiercely independent and under the impression that his mother is mentally ill.\n\tThat all changes when a Terminator (Robert Patrick), similar to the one Schwarzenegger played in 1984, comes onto the scene with a mission to kill John, contrasting to the previous film's intent to off Sarah.  And, in a change of fortune, Schwarzenegger is his counter, reprogrammed to protect the Connors from his malice.  Now with the looming apocalypse a little under two years away, stopping the conception of the technology that caused it is just as pressing as escaping the wrath of the killer robot sent to halt the good in the process of being done.\n\tAt 153 minutes, \"Judgment Day\" is a sci-fi epic at its most iconic, as intellectually gripping as it is action-packed, as flashy as it is sincere.  Sequences of conflict act as masterworks on the part of its stunt choreographers, the human drama tense and, sometimes, even sardonically funny.  This is what an action blockbuster should be: analytically sizable, pulse-pounding, and with just a hint of self-mockery.  It's oily and professional - the genre doesn't get much better than this.  \n\tAnd with a new and improved heroine (Hamilton transforms herself from meek damsel in distress to muscly renegade), a relentless villain, a peak Schwarzenegger, and a child performer at the front and center that matches the scrappiness of the material, just about everything in \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" enthralls on levels so potent that we have to remind ourselves that it isn't an action staple simply because it's a sequel; it's an action staple because it is awesome, in every sense of the word.",

I liked Terminator 2, but everything I absolutely loved about the first - the intrigue, the minimalism (obviously not in regards to the action scenes, but the course of the plot itself plus few characters, all in LA), the heightened suspense - it just wasn't there in this one.  Not that I don't enjoy movies that are more elaborate, because I certainly do, but in the case of the Terminator, I liked that it didn't spiral off.\n\nTerminator 2 just sort of tumbled on for me, taking off with no solid direction so I became less invested in the story the more the plot branched off. The Terminator was so succinct; this movie felt like three in one - which isn't necessarily bad, but it threw me off since my love of the structure of the first one is what drew me to this one. The action scenes were thrilling, of course, and I was so glad to see that the special effects were much better, because I will say that the first Terminator did not age too well, but god, once they gave the Terminator a personality, paired with James Cameron's habit of being too heavy handed with his dialogue - especially when he wants to convey a theme - and I immediately was not as invested in the sequel as I was in the first.  I'm all for sentimentality (speaking of James Cameron, I'm unnaturally obsessed with Titanic), but maybe because the first had so little of it, I was expecting the second to be like it, and it was not.  \n\nAnd once again, Cameron just can't handle sentimentality all that well.  In better hands, maybe it would've been more effective for me, because I did feel my emotions riling at the end, but I wanted a crisp, dark, sci-fi thriller and instead I got an annoying teen 90s boy driving me crazy with his dated slang and his bromance with a robot. Wasn't feeling it. I did like the movie.  I just think The Terminator was so much better than its sequel.  It went from a Blade Runner feel to Independence Day, and I guess I prefer Blade Runner.",

Another attempt is made to assassinate her son (played by the squealing Edward Furlong) and now it's Arnold to the rescue. We're introduced to a new villain in the shape-shifting T-1000, an advanced Terminator model which can quickly repair injuries and disguise itself as people or objects. The visual effects used for this purpose are outstanding.\n \nAlthough I still prefer the darker tone of the first film there's no ignoring how good this sequel is. More accurately, it's about the most perfect blockbuster action film I can remember seeing outside of The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The action scenes are ramped up considerably from the original but are balanced with well-paced character and plot development. The casting is excellent and the writers did a great job of adding depth to the storyline. We learn more about how the machine uprising occurs as the characters continually take steps to prevent it. \n \nI get the impression that James Cameron did his best to prevent further sequels, the conclusion here pretty much wraps things up with a bow. It's no surprise that someone eventually picked up the torch in a money grab, I just can't believe it took twelve years. (segue)",

The difference comes down to genre type. Shifting gears from sci-fi-horror to sci-fi-thriller, these continuing adventures play out more as an action movie than slasher flick to stellar effect. This pulse-pounding action, however, rivals the suspense generated by the first perpetual motion machine. Turning audience expectations on their heads, Schwarzenegger's iconic Terminator now becomes the guardian of the intended victim. It's such a genius twist on the formula that the series never stands a chance at reaching these vaulted great heights again. Putting forth basically the same story, this sequel nonetheless achieves a greater level of depth and emotion in making part two more of a survivor's tale.\n\nIn this R-rated sequel, a Terminator (Schwarzenegger) gets sent back in time to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), the boy destined to lead freedom fighters of the future including his mother (Hamilton), a quintessential survivor who has been institutionalized for her warning of the nuclear holocaust she knows is inevitable. \n\nIn a great turnabout from being the heavy, Schwarzenegger imbues the role with an indelible amount of character. As the liquid metal monster T-1000, however, Robert Patrick exudes menace with every precise step. Linda Hamilton made Sarah Connor more than just a hapless victim in the first chapter, but what she does here - becoming a cold killing machine herself - is superb. The pioneering computer effects remain the star, however, wowing 2015 viewers just as much as the weapons-grade digital work today. The script loses a couple of points for sentimentality in regards to young John Connor, but its nonetheless one of the greatest sequels ever.\n\nBottom line: Rich in Iron",

There were scenes that, to this day, have stuck with me. I remember the ending almost shot-for-shot as I rematch it some 16 years later.\n\nI like the first Terminator film a great deal, but it has that '80s feel to it and it's very dated. But the 1991 sequel is ahead of its time. And 24 years later, It holds up perfectly--just as my memories of it as a child.\n\nIn this movie, a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger), looking exactly like the one who tries to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film, is sent back to the past to protect her son, John Connor (Edward Furlong), who is being hunted down by a more advanced evil cyborg (Robert Patrick) who can morph into any person or metal object.\n\nThe plot is more developed and longer. We realize that there is more at stake here. We know the background already and know who must live and who must die. At 2 and a half hours, the movie never seems to overstay its welcome.\n\nSchwarzenegger has never been more perfect for any role he's played. He's truly at his best and even displays his comedic talents. Patrick, playing the main antagonist, creepily stalks Sarah and John throughout the whole movie, evoking true fear from the audience. \n\nThis is a near-perfect cinematic experience. It's one of my favorite films and it's even better watching it with more context than when I was a child.\n\nTwizard Rating: 100",

Just wait until young John Connor tries to teach the Terminator how to smile. A lot of humor revolves around the John Connor/Terminator relationship within the film.\n\nAlso, the new gender-neutral liquid-metal Terminator is bad-ass, but I also think the worst aspect of the film is with that Terminator in the third act of the film. The evil Terminator is really bad at trying to kill the Connors and/or the Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator. There are points where the new Terminator just stands there when he can be attacking his targets. He takes an unnecessarily long time to get to his targets, and I guess this is so that he may be destroyed.\n\nI've heard the films following this one in the franchise are not as good, and honestly I can't see another Terminator movie being made that can top this one.

With technical achievements and some fine acting performances this becomes not only better than the first in the series, but also just one of the finest entries into the much paved action movie catalogue. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns from the first and so does Sarah Connor, and both are well played and make this story exciting, action packed and even quite surprisingly, emotional.\n\nThis movie is to be fair all about the destruction of John Connor, but I mean that in a way where Robert Patrick is thrown back from the future to try and kill the future human rebel leader. This time the T-800 model otherwise known as the Terminator is back, and now he's had a change of heart, no not really he has just been reprogrammed by John Connor in the future. This plot can seem a little confusing but trust me it is not, it's actually a fine story full of fun moments but a whole lot of down right action fuelled adventure.\n\nThe young man playing the well, young John Connor is Edward Furlong, and he gives a pretty nasty yet good performance, mixing the juvenile teenage rage with raw emotion to create an all together nice feel. Arnie returns with fist pumping muscle and some massive guns and becomes the stuff of legends(quite literally, he makes this classic movie icon). The director, James Cameron, the writer James Cameron(plus William Wisher), and oh my what a movie he has created. He finely crafts this with a fine touch, he never lets this get boring and somehow makes a movie that is exciting from the first minute to the end.\n\nDoes the movie lack anything?, well yes, yes it does. It for me lacks a slight bit of depth, it does it well and anyone who see's the relationship between the Terminator and John will be all quite happy for cyborg-human relations. I do however feel this isn't as intelligent as it maybe thinks it is, and for that point and that point alone, it makes this oh so close to perfection, without being perfect. Now of course saying all this, many many people will give this 10/10 and the such, I think it is incredible and truly a movie to behold so don't hold it against me that I don't think this is 100% flawless, it is for me, probably one of the best movies ever.\n\nWhen you think of a sequel you think many things will return from the first and not only that but also, the sequel will not be as good. It's wrong on the point of it's not as good as it's predecessor, but it also feels new and unique, very different to the 1984 first in line \"The Terminator\" which although I felt was good, is not a patch on this one. It feels slick, new and all together more thought out, Cameron seems to get his act and give it another level meanwhile Hamilton, Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick etc, also do the same.\n\nTerminator 2 is one of those movies you don't forget after watching, I recommend this not only to action fans who maybe haven't ever seen it, but also any movie fan, this is top class stuff. I never thought I'd be saying that an action Sci-Fi was so good but I can't deny it anything, even the score from Brad Fiedel deserves a shout out, all together top notch work from all departments involved.",

Arguably his last great film, the movie is often held as proof that Cameron truly is a great director, as opposed to an effects genius and talented copycat with too much money and power. The argument can ultimately swing both ways, as T2 is really a fantastic film, even if it does begin to show the logical cracks that would destroy the Terminator franchise. The film offers another great cast and a slew of groundbreaking special effects sequences that would fit themselves into the pop culture for years to come. Arnold is once again, fantastic in a quite clever reverse role, while the villain is a successful upgrade, even if his abilities seem to often convenience the script. The primary issue seems to be the over-focus on the mechanics of the story, which abandons the uber-simplistic and minimalist premise of the first film as it attempts to world build for a franchise that probably had no business going anywhere after this film. The results are still fantastic and utterly watchable but for a critical thinker, the demise of Cameron's career as a good filmmaker (as opposed to the rich man's Michael Bay) can be seen here in T2, which tried perhaps a little to hard to set the stage and one up its predecessor.",

            "content": "You could argue that 'The Terminator' didn't really need a sequel as it seemed rather self contained, despite the massive scope it was on but who would have guessed it would have been as iconic and as influential as its predecessor? Sequels are generally expected to improve on the first but the first film was defining when it was released and so was this film, 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', is as much of an iconic classic as its predecessor. With all of the classic lines, new classic lines, and classic moments like crushing the skull.\n\nI think the trailer should have kept it a secret but it might seem somewhat of a clich\u00e9 to new viewers that they take the villain from the first film and turn him into a protagonist but not only is it explained, it adds another layer to the film, not only in terms of action, but in terms of emotion. Seeing T-800 interact with John Connor is honestly quite touching and they share good moments with one another. It always annoyed me that Sarah Connor was put in a hospital, they do explain it somewhat, but surely they would have seen the wreckage at the facility that was in the last film but she did try to bomb a computer factory, so there's that. I mean, sure, it would sound crazy and you feel sorry for Sarah that Kyle burdened her with knowledge but really, no evidence? \n\nBesides Arnold as the Terminator, obviously, the only main cast member to return is Linda Hamilton who probably not only jumped at the chance to return but the character is actually played by the same actor for once. I know many years passed between sequels and things take place in different parts of the timeline, but like I've seen others say as well, it's kind of irritating to see so many people play one person. The cast is great, and like it says with the introduction of Edward Furlong, he does a great job as well with Robert Patrick's villainous T-1000. The effects for this film are groundbreaking still hold up excellently well; it's consistent and has so many little flourishes that add to the style, like when T-800 reveals that shotgun from the box. The action is very memorable and has spectacular set-pieces. It earned 4 very well deserved Oscar wins and the others it lost went to 'JFK' and I remember seeing a documentary about them saying the film was too long and that they took a frame out every so often and they were surprised with how noticeable it was, it just all adds to the bigger picture.\n\nThe script is smart; it gives a clever story with many little parallels and references to things that happened in the last film, like the dogs barking and there was one point where Sarah Connor turns into a Terminator herself. In a similar situation to the last film, you wonder how the T-800 could beat the T-1000 but given the fact that it is two machines going up against each other leads to more action possibilities than the first film, however, I also feel like it takes away from some of the tension, eerie feeling, horror and film-noir elements of the first. Two machines fighting each other are more evenly matched than a machine fighting against humans and that coupled with the fact that the T-1000 seems to disappear for a while takes that away also. Don't get me wrong; however, he is still a ruthless villain that has your attention whenever he is on screen and you still feel tension because of how strong he is, but comparatively speaking, it isn't the same. However, I don't think it was meant to be the same, he loses track of them, and we see that, and then the scenes after are character building, and always make sure to ask for ID when asked something by the police, John also had a good friend. It's something small but I liked that it introduced us to the pin machine John had early in the film, it's needed later in the film as well but, not only is it not drawn too much attention to, he just has it and it's useful, but as we see it being used earlier, it doesn't just come as a shock that he pulls it out of nowhere when it is needed. The film has its humour and he says 'I'll be back' but it works and isn't played up for a joke, although he didn't say please to that person at the start, like I thought he would have after that fight happened; and it has that, 'To Protect and Serve', shot on the police car again. I didn't really like that 'insane world... sane choice' line, it felt a little cheesy.\n\nIt looks like the film is about to end when a character gets frozen but then it carries on for another 20 minutes, the whole film wraps up with a rather heartbreaking ending that is perfectly put together. There is an alternate ending to this film and the way that is staged pretty much would cancel out any sequels, but you know Hollywood would find a way, and they did. I personally would have had the film end with the shutting down screen but I liked the final line and the road footage is symbolic. Some could just say it is sequel disguised as a retread but this film adds so much to that concept and gives it a whole new meaning. One of the only films where the director's cut, the version I have on DVD which is an excellent buy, actually stands up to the original, or may even surpass it. But of course Rotten Tomatoes has to change the poster and the near perfect score of course was ruined, but that always happens. 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' is as smart as it is exhilarating, with its innovative visuals and important themes; it is perfect just like its predecessor but in very different ways. An action classic that I've seen many times before and I'll see again many more times again.",

If you were either born or lived during the nineties, then chances are that you must seen this by now with its amazing story, to the kickass action scenes, and even the characters that were absolutely stellar with their performances. So the premise for this one is that Skynet sends back a T-1000, played by Robert Patrick, a higher model brand of Terminator to kill 10-year-old John Conner in 1995. Despite that fact that this kid looks way older than that, but whatever. However John Conner himself sends back his own Terminator to protect his younger self and survive. Thus begins a new 2 and a half hour of badassness from beginning to end. Let's get this review underway, shall we?\n\nAs I said earlier, the actors who play these characters in here are absolutely fantastic, spot-on with their roles, and never feel wasted for one second. My personal favorites in this film are Robert Patrick as the T-1000 and as Linda Hamilton Sarah Conner. The T-1000's appearance may look deceiving  at first, being less muscular and smaller than the Terminator, but is way more powerful with his liquid metal abilities by taking various forms and shapes to using a wide variety of tools and stabbing weapons to take out his targets. The CG work in here is great as well, especially for early nineties standards. It is a fine example of computer graphics that is used the right way. Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Conner who comes a long way from being the defenseless waitress in the first film to this soldier of fortune paranoid badass who would break you in half if you were to cross her. All the characters in this movie start somewhere and end somewhere else personality wise. For example, John Conner starts off as this wise-ass little bastard and ends up being this sweet sentimental kid after bonding with the Terminator. Overall, this movie goes beyond my five star rating for various reasons. In fact, I put this film in my Top 15 Greatest Movies of all time.",

The direction of where the characters have gone is very well thought out. Sarah Connor is now one of the most badass chicks to ever be on screen. Her arc is so fascinating. I love the idea of taking the unbeatable evil machine from the first film and having it protect them in this one. The action takes several steps up into the right place while each scene is intensified by either the subtle score or the incredible camera shots. Arnold Schwarzenegger is an even bigger badass in this one. He becomes more of a superhero than before. I don't think the new T1000 is as scary as the terminator from the first film however he is still frightening in other ways. It is very sad to think the franchise derailed from here because these first two films are a self contained story on their own and did not need useless sequels to present the most captivating story across. This one is more fun to watch and enjoy than the first while still being sadder and manages to stretch upon that horrific view of the future. The subtle ways Cameron pushes the underlying story across is highly needed because without it there would still be pieces missing. It is also an interesting turn where Arnold's Terminator becomes the real main character. While watching T2 it becomes evident that he is the reason to watch even more so than Linda Hamilton's prominent female lead. Either way, watch this film, it's a must.",

It is actually one of the few films to hold a unanimous rating on Rotten Tomatoes. So it was pretty much impossible to make a worthy sequel. Or so it seemed.\n\nThe sequel revolves around a mission similar to that of the first movie. The machines set to destroy humanity send another cyborg back in time to kill John Conner, the leader of the human resistance. This time, they send a more advanced model to kill him as a child. However, the humans are once again, one step ahead of them. This time, they send a reprogrammed terminator, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, back to protect him.\n\nSchwarzenegger once again makes this role his own. The fact that this time he is playing the good guy allows for him to play a character who is more than just intimidating. It was also in this movie where he says some of the character's most iconic lines. All in all, it would be very difficult to imagine anybody else playing this role.\n\nThe movie itself has plenty of action, and there is some tension since it is uncertain how the good terminator will kill the seemingly indestructible bad one. James Cameron's directing takes  The characters are also handled very well. One of the standouts is Sarah Conner, John's mother. In the first movie, she was mostly helpless, but now the events of the last movie have made her a complete bad-ass and a more interesting character.\n\nThe movies story also makes good use of its intriguing premise. There are plenty of plot points that are able to elevate the movie beyond formulaic. The movie is sometimes exciting and sometimes interesting, but never boring, and never loses the audiences attention. There are even a few emotional scenes; the movie pulls off the difficult task of making the audience feel for an emotionless robot.\n\nThis is the ideal action movie. It is one of the best sequels of all time, and probably the best for the action genre.\n\nJaythemovieguy.blogspot.com",

This time Sarah Connor is not the target but her son John Connor, a wise cracking street kid. What follows is 2 and 1/2 hours of sheer rollercoaster action which only occasionally pauses for breath.

To avoid's Skynet future plans, they are trying to get rid everything about it and move on. Suddenly, T-1000 came, as it is programmed to terminate the young John Connor. Now this film gets intensified. The plot is simple yet very straight forward. Like there's no more bullsh*t and just being straight to the point. And the action scenes are pretty legit. It is over the top, but very realistic in terms of explosions and gunfights. The chasing scenes are one of the most memorable chasing scenes ever in an action film. You kinda feel for everything, especially for the characters. The relationship between the kid and the cyborg is funny yet cute to watch. But then, easily one of the most well made sequels ever made. It's gripping, and it's a nail biter till the end. Tops my list of the most bad ass action films ever. 5/5",

            "content": "When you don't see a movie for a long period of time it's easy to assume that nostalgia was making you think highly of it, and that it would not hold up if you revisit the film decades later. T2 offered none of the expected disappointment, in fact I might have liked it even better now. As a passionate fan of all forms of time-travel in film, I am naturally inclined to like these movies, but the story goes well beyond time travel. It delves into deep human emotions and asks us to question what we are willing to sacrifice in order to save the future. They even have complex relationships, including a child who feels abandoned by his mother and in desperate need of a stable role model. Forget the fact that the role model he seems to choose is a cyborg, it works really well as some character growth among all the chaos of the battles being waged. The cast is all spectacular, including Arnold in one of his best roles. In this installment he is allowed to blend his action movie and comedic styles, and the occasionally wooden tone he uses works to his advantage because he is not playing a human. I also like that Linda Hamilton gets to play such a wide range of emotions. She is legitimately going a little crazy, she is physically and emotionally tough, but she is also extremely protective and loving to her son in other scenes.\n\nWhat Cameron did in Terminator 2 is absolutely brilliant, in fact I wish more sequels were this smart. It perfectly plays on the audience's expectations from the first film. In every way it sets up like the original Terminator to the point where you fully expect Arnold will be killing John Connor. And then, almost 20 minutes into the film, the first confrontation occurs and the script is flipped completely. Suddenly you realize things are not at all as you suspected. It is so perfectly executed that, if I were to make any complaint about this film, it would be the trailer. It's not that it fails to make the movie exciting but it does spoil the excellent twist, that the nice honest guy in the cop uniform is even more dangerous than the killing machine we saw last time. Every moment in this movie worked for me. They managed to get me emotionally attached to a machine, and to make me terrified of Robert Patrick. The effects worked extremely well, especially considering this was made in 1991, and the set pieces are bombastic but shot in such a way that I never lose track of what is going on. When I watch an amazing film like this I can't help but feel discouraged that James Cameron seems so determined to devote his career to those stupid Avatar movies when he can do so much better.",

I get that it's about time travel so a little mind fuckery is expected, but the Terminator franchise is just all over the place and doesn't know what it wants to be. \n\nAnyway, Terminator 2 is great. The special effects were ahead of their time. CGI and liquid metal work well together, just like stop animation and robots. The action is so intense and destructive it's like watching a war and each machine represents a whole army. The chase scene is fantastic. It's a David and Goliath action sequence that really puts you at the edge of your seat. Arnold is adorable, Robert Patrick is intimidating, Linda Hamilton is badass and one of the better movie heroines, but unfortunately Eddie Furlong is kind of annoying with his whiny voice.",

            "content": "Most sequels never live up to the hype or recreate a true succession to its source material, Aliens example, is widely regarded as the best sequel of all time, which i dont agree with. But aside from Mad Max 2 and The Dark Knight, only one film really managed to take all the great elements of their predecessor and build on them in such an impressive way, broadening the scope of the source material, ramping up the action and fleshing out the characters. That film was Terminator 2. With a much larger budget that the first one and an artistic freedom that the first film and Aliens allowed him, due to box office success, James Cameron goes to work here, remaking certain elements of the original to better fit his idea, while building upon the story massively. John Conner, now a teenager, lives under the supervision of foster parents, his mum Sarah is locked away in a mental asylum for trying to blow up Skynet and rambling about a future robot war that nobody can really get their heads across. This time 2 Terminators are sent back through time, one that has been reprogrammed to protect John and the other a new sophisticated killing machine that is made of liquid metal and can shape shift. As these 2 killing machines battle it out to achieve their goal John and Sarah must bring down Skynet once and for all, before its too late. As i mentioned earlier, Cameron does go to great lengths to recreate some of the first movies elements, the future war for example is redone with all new shiney model work and live action practical effects, it actually looks and feels like a future that is possible. Sarah voice overs the events of the first, rendering it needless as this film really can stand on its own 2 feet without it, Cameron also builds upon the films core ideas and really goes in depth with them this time around. If the original was a mixed genre that opened our eyes, T-2 is is well refined new model. Parralelling the Terminators themselves, using their ability to not only highlight the shift in time but how redundant the original can be, in some comparissons to the newer, shiner model. With the directors cut, the film is almost doubled in length, which gives us time, something the original lacked, allowing us to wrap our heads around what was going on, much like it refines its look and feel. This is science fiction action at its finest. Its shiny, gory, the score is huge, it feels more human. Even with Conner's attempts to humanize the T-800, allow Arnold to be more than just a killing machine, while staying faithful to the source. Arnold puts it a game changing performance and Robert Patrick as his nemesis is terrifying as the Liquid Metal fear machine, that just wont stay down. Patrick's mannerisms are perfect, for example when entering a new location he scans his field of vision from left to right, reading all the information he can, the way he runs after Conner with his hands in a pointed manner, makes him look like a preying mantis, even his ability to become vaguely emotional to convince people he is real is brilliant. He manages to give of just the right amount of doubt throughout his perfomance and at points, you really feel like the trio are completely fucked. The main star of the show is Sarah, Linda Hamilton is now allowed to go to town with her acting chops, shes no longer some clueless woman thrust into a situation that makes no sense, she is a hardened warrior, fearing for the future and her sons safety. She plays with her emotions to get what she wants and you can physically see she is a broken mess, trying to juggle everything as the world she tries to save just wont allow her. It's a huge leap forward for her in terms of character and although i wouldnt expect this level of depth in the original, he performance here makes that look shambolic. The action is the film is, for its time and even to this day, epic! Dont worry if you liked your relentless chase sequence from the original, this movies exposition comes while characters move from set piece to set piece, each on growing in scale and horror. The car and bike chases are outstandingly huge, helicopter chases, swat teams, mini gun rampages, 2 machines battering the shit out of each other. It goes balls out here and you know all about it. Stan Winston is allowed to go to town using his effects team and his make up and effect work is flawless this time around, as Arnold progresses through the film we see him become more battered and bruised, Stan shows this perfectly, no more plastic looking model work, here its all face masks, make up and prosthetics and it looks stunning. Cameron also has tightened the reign and allowed for a more focused and choreographed film. There are however some flaws, flaws that although may not have been such an issue at the time, certainly didnt age well. Where to begin? Edward Furlong, although he does better than a lot of child actors, here his character is written with yet again typical James Cameron cheese, spouting lines like \"Dickwad\" and \"Awesome\" every five minutes. Its cringe worthy to watch him teach the Terminator, look at it one way and its a master stroke of genius, but look at the language he teaches him, \"Asta La Vista Baby\" \"Chill out\" and \"Dickwad\". It shatters the greatness going on here as Arnold just flat out repeats the lines in a comical dead pan fashion but its like Cameron didnt know that phrases like that only stick around for a year or so, making them redundant in future years. Furlong is at his best however when Cameron writes his lines like an adult and here we get some great work between him and Arnold, as he tries to convince a machine that is solely built to kill to be a person. Also, i'm sorry but it has to be said, for the time the liquid metal effects looked good but god dam, relying so heavily on them makes this film shamelessly dated. The effects were ground braking for the time, now however we are tugged straight out of the movie every single time Robert Patrick turns silver. Its a minor gripe, i know, but it really is frustrating to compare Stan's work with the visual effects team and to note that CGI, just cant compare. Regardless, T-2 is a masterpiece, it broke our minds back in the day and today is hailed as one of the classics, mention Terminator to anyone older than 16 and if they had no idea what it was, it would be acceptable to slap them. Although not as rugged as the original, this shiny new model, is more refined and intricate, much like its new antagonist.",

The acting is surprisingly better even though the first movie is great.

The characters are very memorable,  Sarah Conner is even more bad*bleep*, and the Terminator is really cool while having some memorable one-liners. The action scenes are more exciting, and the soundtrack is even more catchy. It's investing to watch, and it has an even more memorable villain.

While Terminator 2 is faster and more entertaining than the first installment, the acting is lacking (mostly John's character) and the plot is less than stellar.  I suppose it didn't help that I was able to guess the ending of the film without watching it.  Immediately after figuring out the Terminator was made of liquid I knew there could only be one solution.  But not only that, all of the twists and turns were also predictable.  To some extent Terminator 2 is just a rehashing of the original Terminator.  And finally, can we talk about how terrible the young John Connor is!  He's a cussing prick, for lack of a better word.  He is by no means endearing, or particularly relatable, and while James Cameron tries to create a likable character by introducing character development, it just slows down the action.  Unfortunately, we are unable to look past the characters continuing flaws.  \n\nNow I'm sure your wondering: Why did you give this movie four stars if you hated it so much?  Well... the action is wonderful, especially in the first couple scenes.  And of course the animation is bar none for the time.  You can easily see where the Matrix got many of it's ideas from.

To avoid's Skynet future plans, they are trying to get rid everything about it and move on. Suddenly, T-1000 came, as it is programmed to terminate the young John Connor. Now this film gets intensified. The plot is simple yet very straight forward. Like there's no more bullsh*t and just being straight to the point. And the action scenes are pretty legit. It is over the top, but very realistic in terms of explosions and gunfights. The chasing scenes are one of the most memorable chasing scenes ever in an action film. You kinda feel for everything, especially for the characters. The relationship between the kid and the cyborg is funny yet cute to watch. But then, easily one of the most well made sequels ever made.

But Terminator 2: Judgement Day is not only an excellent sequel but also establishes a landmark in blockbuster cinema-making. Despite belonging to different generation this movie was almost 10 times more entertaining to watch than today's Transformers like crap. The highlights of T2 are its ground-breaking visual effects and awesome sound effects, surprises me that this movie was released in 1991. I know that visual effects only is not a measure of the quality of a film, but one must respect the achievements of T2 for establishing such great use of CGI for the very first time. Keeping aside the effects, the movie is still an excellent sci-fi action with a heart-touching story and memorable characters. Also should not forget the first terminator film which inspired all these sequels, of which only T2 makes remarkable use.\n\nIt is almost impossible to talk about the plot without giving away one of the biggest shocking moments of cinema history.I really did not see that twist coming. Thus, leave the plot as it is almost a rehash of the previous one. Two guys sent back from the future to finish off John Conner so that he doesn't become leader of the Resistance. Well last time target was John's mother, this time target young John himself. Despite having similar story-line what makes it interesting is the relationship between the characters and great performances especially by Linda Hamilton and also Arnold. Edward Furlong also was lovable as 10 year old John. The action sequences are much grander here than in first film and terminator much more deadlier. Also lot humor thrown in all of which makes it more likable in general. Still the movie has enough sci-fiction elements which make us think and emotional themes to make it heartfelt.\n\nBrad Fiedel's score with slightly improved effects was fantastic.All the Oscar's this film got for its effects were well deserved. Unlike the first film which was much more focused and incredibly original, T2 covers different grounds of humanity, love, emotions and relations that kind of dilutes out its dreadful elements of the Terminator which were the focus of first film. Also T2 is much longer than T1 but it has enough content packed. The climax felt a bit prolonged, yet the ending was emotionally satisfying. Cameron has done a outstanding job with another great sequel, it gets all the things a sequels must do spot on. A big thanks to him a creating such an excellent sci-fi world with these 2 films, which gets ruined by its unnecessary and disappointing third and fourth installment. Cameron said his vision ended with this film and he was damn right. Both the Terminator films and 'Aliens' are his best films till date.\n\nRATING: [4.5/5]",

This second Terminator film truly is greater in every way. \n\nIn comparison with the first Terminator film is this second installment much better when it comes to action sequences, practical effects and storytelling. The major improvement is of course the villain: the T-1000. He's so scary and awesome at the same time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are all spectacular actors, and their characters are so incredible and you really feel close to them. The actors are much more professional now than in the first film. There's a massive amount of action in this movie, and there's a huge amount of cool and unique things at the same time. The action is much faster and there are spectacular practical effects that just look incredible. The first Terminator film got some doll models, but this does not. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a highly entertaining and well-made film that got a touching story and even some humor! The opening scene and the ending are both great, even though the ending felt a bit to rash. The soundtrack is also great, but it could have been even groovier, which could have made the film even cooler and dramatic. \n\nThis movie got it all: great science fiction, awesome action sequences and fantastic storytelling. Not to mention the incredible script.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day gets an 8.8/10.",

            "content": "This was amazing. So much better than the first one; it's almost like the first one existed to set up for the sequel. When I first heard the plot of the sequel, I was a little skeptical, wondering why it's considered so great if it's essentially the same plot. To me, it seemed as if the plot for the sequel should deal with the actual war years later, which ended up being the plot of Salvation.\n\nLuckily, the story was a lot different. There was the whole subplot of them trying to take down Skynet, which was really cool. As long as you don't think about the continuity too much - if they prevent Judgment Day, then how did the Terminator originally come back, etc. - it wrapped up really well. But I actually enjoyed how the continuity wasn't too rigid. It reminded me of Looper in that closure and a great story took precedence over strict continuity. Of course, maybe the other sequels dash that and explain the continuity more clearly, but I've heard mostly bad things about the sequels, so I probably won't watch them.\n\nThe thing is, though, even if that entire subplot (it is arguably a subplot) was gone from the movie, it'd still be a really solid rehash of the first installment. Virtually everything about this one is better. Sarah Connor gets to be extraordinarily badass. The emotions are so much more complex; the Terminator's relationship with Sarah and especially John is much more interesting and thoughtful than Kyle and Sarah's relationship in the first movie. The movie is hilarious throughout, finally taking advantage of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Terminator's comic potential. And then there's the special effects, which are just phenomenal. I was shocked to see such great effects in a 1991 movie. There are so many aspects of this movie that are so perfectly done - the characters, humor, action, and plot are all so superior to the first movie. And I LIKED the first movie.",

The better part is open for debate but there is no denying that Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a worthy successor to one of Sci Fi's greatest films. T3 and T4 are not horrible movies but compared to the T1 and T2 they are absolute garbage, in the same way that Godfather III is a decent flick but does not deserve the name Godfather. Arnold became a star as a bad guy and now he returns to that role but this time he is programmed to be the hero. The action and spectacle is top notch and the new baddie T-1000, played by Robert Patrick, is very scary. A shapeshifter who can take down Arnold's T-800 model with relative ease. As I said in my review if the first one, the best performance in that flick was Linda Hamilton. Going from the happy go-lucky early 20 something to the tough as nails mother of the Savior of the human race was pure genius. She picks up 12 years later(Terminator timeline is the only thing that doesn't make sense) I am saying 12 years because that's how old Edward Furlong's John Connor looks, 12 years later Sarah is a mental patient and her son is with a foster family. She knows the end is coming and this doesn't drive her insane, it drives her to be more determined but it also calls for her to wait for her moment by playing along. As soon as she sees the T-800's chiseled face, she knows her son is in danger and she springs into action. Cameron has always been a fan of strong women and Sarah Connor is his strongest. The Terminator really is her story, at least thru the first two. Other than the timeline issues, this a well thought and written script and as cool as Arnold is a bad guy, I'd rather root for him than against him.",

The most interesting character was Sarah Connor and her transformation from soft waitress to military commander was the highlight. However, even that was spoiled by the fairly cheesy emotionalism of the scene where she confronts the scientist in his home. Whenever a serious film gives a 12 year old or so a major part you know it's not going to be very good and the decision was made for marketing (as is so obvious with a crassly commercialized film like Star Wars Episode One). I have nothing against little kids in films, but they really are best in films that are made for kids. Too many productions try to appeal to everyone and slather on a load of peripheral marketing (like HappyMeals), yielding a soft overproduced TV movie quality result. The sequel should have been more gritty, not less. Why weren't we in the future, after the nukes?",

            "content": "I'm torn about my eating for this movie, I think it wa definatly as good as the first in many ways and better in others, but I simply didn't like the enemy terminator.  He was too si-fi, and basically invincible.  His ability to form anything his size and do stuff like form his arm into a sword just didn't go well with me. If he was just a more advanced but similar terminator to the original it would have fared better with me.  But besides that the movie was very good.  The effects were far improved from the original which was nice and it was cool to have a terminator on the good side who's learning from the people he's around.  The story was of course cool, and it was interesting to see how they go after the maker of the technology that made the world destroy itself.  The action scenes were good, cool like the first movie, and there is never a lack of unexpected twists.  The action scenes are all chases, which are good for suspense, and there is never a lack of the good Terminator doing awesome things while he fights.  If there is ever a choice of the single most badass awesome action character, it's the Terminator, and he's more badass in this film than the original in my opinion.  Some scenes shouldn't be there, but they are short and few.  The last battle is pretty cool, with a desperate fight to save John Connor that looks hopeless, and makes you wonder mabey he actually won't make it.  But we know know with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines that no matter what the machines will rise somehow, so unfortunately all the destroying of all the secret technology dosen't save them as we expect.  But that dosent mean the end of the film isn't sad and heroic.  That final scenes when the good Terminator asks to be lowered and is lowered into a pool of boiling liquid steel is so sad and perfect, and we really believe that the future filled with deadly machines won't end up happening.  But we now know it does, but the movie itself was great, not as good as the first one simply because I didn't like the invincible enemy terminator.  But the movie was great as a whole and I recommend watching it.",

The performances from Arnold to Robert Patrick are SUPERB, the story gets more original and intense and adds more to Judgement Day from the last film, the special effects and action hold up so well that it won FOUR OSCARS, the emotions get very strong with John Connor and the T-1000 (or the Terminator), the tension gets even higher, and the sequel that looked to have ended the two films.

The action is exciting, and very fun to watch. It's not one big chase scene though, the film slows down at times to give its characters more depth, which is something that wasn't as heavily used in the first.

            "content": "Unlike a lot of sequels, T2 feels more like a mulligan for the first film than a foray into its universe. The plot is essentially identical: two heroes are sent back in time to duel for the fate of John Connor. This time, Cameron makes good on the potential of his premise. Every character is given a complex psychology and plenty of time to explore it. The Terminator's arc is mostly played for cutesy robot moments, and John Connor doesn't swear quite enough to overcome his whiny quippy shit kid status, but Sarah Connor emerges from the mental ward cocoon as a beautiful militaristic conspiracy nutjob butterfly. \n\nI love how the film handles her character. Cameron creates a classic wrongly accused victim narrative; we root for her since we know all her \"delusions\" are real, that she isn't really crazy. But as the true narrative imposes its reality on the world of the asylum, Sarah retains elements of her \"insane\" persona that don't actually jive with that narrative. She is obsessed with military solutions, applying hammers to scenarios best approached with finesse. In this she is not too far from the Terminator itself, and it is up to John to show them both back to the middle way, the reasonable human value set they're all working to defend (Miles Dyson offers a mirror inverse of the effect technology has had on the Connor family). John Connor rolling his eyes at her militant feminist rant is the best bit in the movie. \n\nWith more interesting characters and a few ideas and value sets moving around, it's a bit easier to get drawn into the action scenes. These are, in my opinion, generally more creative and intimate than anything in the first film. The long sequence from Sarah's breakout to the elevator stabbing nightmare to the car-T-1000 footrace is brilliant. Even the hammy minigun and mortar barrage of the police barricade has some character relevance. The final action sequence is a bit too long and hammy for me, and I'm still not sold on the blue/red lighting scheme, but it's a definite improvement on the sequence it mimics from the first film. \n\nIt's not perfect or amazing by any means, but it redeems the mistakes of the first movie and lives up to the potential of its premise. There are enough characters and thematic materials woven through the action to humanize and tense up those scenes. I enjoyed it.",

I mean shit Sarah Conor is more badass then Sylvester Stallone in most of his roles. It feels so refreshing to watch this movie because it has so much. I never found myself questioning the liquid metal robot which is something to take note of considering I just called the T-1000 a \"liquid metal robot\". I mean how did Cameron pull this off? I will tell you how cause he knows to build off and original concept that involves one main antagonist and take it to the next level with incredible action. Watch Aliens if you need more evidence of this phenomenon. All in all it's one of the best movies you will ever see because there are just so many moments where you can say \"Holy shit that was dark\" or \"Holy shit that was sad\" or \"Holy shit that was cool\" or \"Holy f*cking shit did you just see that liquid metal transform into another person and stab him in the f*cking face o my god!\"",

I showed this movie to my step son recently and he'd never seen it before. He didn't know what year it was made and halfway through he said \"the effects in this film are amazing!\" That's what really amazed me about it, it's over 20 years old and it looks better than a lot of modern blockbusters. Arnie is fantastic as the Terminator and the rest of the cast hold their own also. The scene in the biker bar at the start has to be one of my favourite scenes of all time.",

            "content": "I'm convinced that if James Cameron had somehow ended up directing Robocop 2 back in 1990 and Highlander II: The Quickening in 91, the world would be a vastly better place to live in! What I'm saying is, James Cameron is seriously good at making sequels. So much so he should be the go-to person in Hollywood for anyone looking to make a franchise entry. Maybe set up a consulting firm or something, and spare us from terrible sequels forever more!\n\nI base this complete adulation for Mr. Cameron's superior ways of the sequel on Aliens and Terminator 2, and you'll find my ode to awesomeness that is Aliens here.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day is the perfect sequel in my opinion. Essentially the same plot as the first film, in that a highly skilled and powerful assassin is sent back in time to kill the person, in this case John Connor( Edward Furlong), responsible for the human's victory over the machines in the future. As before, a lone protector is also sent, but this time around, James Cameron has a little fun by keeping our time traveler's roles a mystery until it's time for the big reveal.\n\nHe also doesn't just stop with a simple repeat of the first films plot, he builds on it. In Judgment day we get to know more about how the machines became our uber intelligent mean-spirited overlords! We even get to meet the one man responsible for the machines intelligence, and then debate over the pros and cons of his death. Add to that some pretty vivid and shocking imagery of a nuclear blast in downtown Los Angeles, and it's clear this sequel hasn't just been thrown together to make a quick buck.\n\nTerminator 2 takes everything that was great about the first film, and makes it better. It's slickly made, looks fantastic, and the action is staged perfectly. It was one of the first films to make use of CGI technology, and the makeup effects are a vast improvement over the original Terminator movie. Beyond the Oscar-winning technical aspects of the film, it's also a showcase for a fantastic performance from Linda Hamilton, and Brad Fiedel again provides another superb score.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you liked the original, I'm pretty certainly you'll be okay with the sequel. T2 isn't as raw or as Tech-noir as the original, but the action is staged better, and it punctuates its story with some really nice moments of humor. Terminator 2 isn't really suitable for younger audiences.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is a big screen movie all the way. How else will you properly enjoy the Oscar nominated photography? At home a HD viewing is recommended. When this came out back in 91, I saw it 6 times at the theater!\n\nBest moment: << spoiler! >>\n\nThe scene where Sarah Connor dreams about a nuclear attack on Los Angeles is both breathtaking, and disturbing. Especially when the blast wave hits and abruptly cuts off Sarah's scream, and her flesh is torn from her body leaving behind her skeleton still holding onto a fence.\n\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, killer robots from the future, early 1990s. Do you realize what this means? If you guessed cartoon, what the fuck? No, this is a big-budget action movie with growing-in-popularity CGI effects. Probably the definitive film of that category, among the early 1990s. Terminator 2: Judgment Day switches the T-800 (AWRNULD) from being an unstoppable death machine programmed to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) to being an unstoppable death machine programmed to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah's son. The robot set to kill John is the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a robot structured by metal that can melt at near room temperature. This means that the T-1000 is a shapeshifter. John is the future leader of the human army, fighting against the man-made robots in a future war. In the present setting, John is a ten-year-old rebellious brat with a thrill for action. Sarah is in a mental institute, as a result of the events of the first Terminator film. She is fearful of what the future holds -- Judgment Day, when a huge explosion wipes out most of the human race. Caused by the actions of Skynet, a corporation responsible for creating the killer robots, the Connors aim to prevent development in robotic technology so that Judgment Day and the war between humans and machines never happen. Whether that is possible or not is left ambiguous, a smart choice on the screenwriters' parts.\n\nFrom more recent experience, I find James Cameron's stories to be dull, perhaps in relation to how he uses films primarily as means of reaching new technological feats in cinema. He has admitted this, too. Terminator 2 is thankfully an exception. The first half-hour lays out the stark, apocalyptic world resulting from Judgment Day. A middle-aged John Connor sends a lone robot to the past to protect himself. Which robot? I spoiled this already, but the film introduces the two terminators in a fashion to trick you. The slow-mo moment before T-800 and T-1000 fight for John Connor is very suspenseful. From there, the action satisfies my appetite for destruction. Speaking of which, the music, be that Brad Fiedel's familiar Terminator music, George Thorogood, or Guns 'n' Roses, fits perfectly well with the similarly hard-hitting action. The best action is when the T-1000 isn't operating some random vehicle. This is a shape-shifting robot. James Cameron does not need to drag out car chases, for the sake of everything, \"making sense.\" The big explosions, which look as amazing as one might expected from James Cameron's wallet, aren't only employed for look-at-the-screen action. Sarah has a nightmare of what happens on Judgment Day. Fiery, city-devastating, and skin-melting, it's quite a horrifying divergence from the relatively clean action.\n\nAs with other classic action films, the calmer moments are entertaining too, kinda.  Schwarzenegger isn't much of an actor, but his best role just may be the T-800. Oddly, he seems most human when under the mechanical constraint. His naivety to human interactions is refreshingly funny at some times, and heartwarming at other times. I'm not even that fond of fish-out-of-water jokes. John Connor does not help matters though. I'm rewriting this review to take him into account. While Sarah Connors holds out on her own finely, John is, as I said, a brat. For a future warrior, I wish he amounted to more than a comic relief kid with annoying lingo. Only now do I realize that I did not give a shit about his safety. How is that good for a plot based entirely around the life and death of that character? I suppose it's okay, as I found the \"hasta la vista, baby\" moment to be beautiful. The film isn't a comedy or even that light, though lighter than its predecessor. Terminator 2 deserves enough credit for both standing out separately from the first Terminator in its greater interest towards awesome action and evolution of the cinematic sci-fi robot, while also following the story by smartly establishing stakes that may result in the extinction of the human race, and how to terminate those stakes.",

The loads of unforgettable action scenes and stunning special effects are impeccable, making this film a must-see blockbuster. Director James Cameron reunites Arnold Schwarzenegger (Predator), this time as the good cyborg, and Linda Hamilton (Dante's Peak) as Sarah Connor, in an epic battle to safe humanity's future. Other cast members are Robert Patrick (The Faculty), Joe Morton (Speed), Jenette Goldstein (Aliens), Xander Berkeley (24) and introducing Eward Furlong as John Connor. Make sure to see the special edition where there's a scene with Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). He told us he's be back!\n\nThe year is 1995 and ten year old troublemaker John  Connor (Furlong) is living in Los Angeles with his foster parents, Todd (Berkeley) and Janelle (Goldstein). His mother Sarah Connor (Hamilton), who was preparing him for his future role as leader of the human resistance against Skynet, got arrested a some time ago and is imprisoned in a mental hospital. \n\nTwo Terminators are sent from the future. Skynet's T-1000 model (Patrick) is instructed to eliminate John Connor, while the other is the T-800 (Schwarzeneggger) that is reprogrammed by the rebels to protect the boy. The T-1000 consist of liquid metal and can take on different shapes. Both Terminators track down John in a shopping mall. After a pursuit the T-800 model is able to escape with John, who learns that the other Terminator will stop at nothing to get to him. His foster parents are dead.  Fearing that his mother's life is in danger, John orders the T-800 to help free her. And so they go to the mental hospital, where Sarah is already put into action her own plan to escape. How will the woman react when she sees her son with a cyborg that looks like the one that tried to kill her all those years ago?",

Characters are more fleshed out, the plot is really intriguing, the director makes better use out of his actors, and the action sequences are just plain fun.\n\nThis time around, a short explanation of the concept is given at the start of the film, which is useful for newcomers, but also helps to set the plot. I enjoy a little explanation, and this film does it well, both at the start and during the film. You get just enough information to figure out why everything is going on, and it never detracts from the action or character.\n\nSpeaking of characters, we got some great ones. Schwarzenegger's Terminator is back, but has more lines and a very interesting arc. Hamilton's Sarah Connor really shows how the events of the previous film affected her; she is definitely fighting for the right side, but is far from saintly. Edward Furlong's John Connor both typifies what a ten-year-old would do in these situations, but also sets up his character's future prospects (I could have done without all the cursing, though.) Robert Patrick is very intriguing as his character (I can't reveal much, since there's a really cool mislead in Act I). Finally, a notable standout in the supporting cast is Joe Morton as Miles Dyson. He really squeezes a lot of nuance out of his character.\n\nThis movie has a cool story (complete with surprises), awesome action, and rock-solid character. I now understand why people enjoy the Terminator franchise.",

            "content": "After the success of the previous film and the consecration of its Arnie as an action superstar, Cameron does the most sensical thing by resurrecting the franchise and casting him in the role of the hero. The audience is now forced to accept without questions asked that the same cyborg that had been sent to kill Sarah Connor in the previous film was now sent back in time to protect her son against an even more advanced and indestructible mean cyborg who wants to kill the child. The film was, of course, a box office hit and is commonly regarded as the best of the Terminator film. Full stop. Yet, apart from the disappointment in having been almost too naturally force fed a plot twist that is more implausible than other sci-fi film controversies from the 'Greedo shot first' one of the Star Wars films, there is a little less appeal in seeing Arnie play a more 'child friendly' version of his badass Terminator - the version he had portrayed in his 1984 performance and that was arguably most responsible for making him a star. Yes, Terminator 2 is a greatly entertaining film with its fair share of spectacular sequences and breathtaking CGI that certainly make the most out of the increased budget that was certainly greater than the one Cameron had made the 1984 film with. In fact, nothing can be said about the film's commercial appeal and the gripping pace of this film. Yet, at the same time it is precisely this radically more commercial approach that makes this Terminator film less influential at its core than the previous movie, where everything seemed perhaps more genuine and more inventive as well as amazingly darker and less dumb brained and overworked to suit the popcorn munching audiences. Terminator II: Judgement Day represents the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of blockbuster science fiction action flicks, yet despite of its reputation it ain't quite as groundbreaking as you would expect it to be.",

This great action sequel Terminator 2 Judgment day is about the decade after Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) destroyed the original Terminator, a second unstoppable killing machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives from the post-apocalyptic year 2029. But this time his mission is to stop an even deadlier Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), made entirely of shape-shifting liquid metal and determined to kill young John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance. Sarah, John, and the Terminator counter by going after the scientist responsible for developing Skynet, the computer system fated to destroy humanity, leading to an explosive and spectacular clash with the fate of humanity in the balance. Whereas James Cameron's original THE TERMINATOR was a low-budget marvel of efficiency and speed, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is an action-packed blockbuster with some of the most amazing stunts ever filmed and ground-breaking, Academy Award-winning special effects. Star Schwarzenegger was paid in the form of a $15 million dollar jet to revisit his most famous role as the Terminator, this time made kinder and gentler against the silent, relentless T-1000. One of the most popular films of the 1990s, James Cameron's action masterpiece is both a thoughtful look at violence in human nature and an exciting, nonstop thrill ride.",

This film, for me, hearkens back to a silver age of cinema where directors had something to prove - where their passion was poured into their work because they knew they had to do the best that they could or no one would pay attention.

But 'Terminator 2' has always been cherished by a larger audience because, owing to several crucial reasons, it reaches higher than that of any other throwaway action flick.  Coming in three years before 'Jurassic Park', the effects in this movie were also amazing for their time, and with the decision of making Arnie a good guy, the Austrian-born actor was established as an A-listing action hero.  Equally marvellous is Robert Patrick as the evil terminator, and while teenage John Connor is a little shit, the friendship between him, his mother, and his leathered-jacketed guardian, lends this film a great depth of human character which was virtually non-existent in the first film.  Although still shockingly violent at times, the film carries a certain sense of morality - amazingly, Arnie doesn't kill one person in this film - and in my opinion, this makes T2 all the more enjoyable.

Continuing the story of the first film, Terminator 2: Judgment day finds The Terminator played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, sent back in time from the future again, but this time switching sides to become the protector of the human race's future hope John Connor. Meanwhile Connor's mother, who tries to spread the knowledge of an apocalyptic future that she acquires in the first film, is deemed insane and confined to an institution. The action is almost nonstop with shopping mall shootouts, truck/motorcycle chases, and various other action set pieces produced throughout the film.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the film that made CGI effects the standard and as such, can be considered a major influence of all big budget action effects movies. Its greatest technical achievement is the shape-shifting T1000 character who pursues John Connor and makes it necessary for The Terminator to act as protector. The film continually ratchets up the tension to the next level as the T1000 comes closer and closer to destroying young John, making Terminator 2 a thoroughly exciting thrill ride basically from start to finish.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile playing the character with the same serious expression as in the original, Arnold obviously relishes the chance to be the good guy in this one, and the script provides him with plenty of silly one liners to provide the otherwise dark film some levity. Linda Hamilton turns in a frantic performance as a desperate mother locked away because everyone thinks she's insane. Terminator 2: Judgment day is another classic produced from James Cameron without a doubt.",

            "content": "The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather Part Two are two sequels that many could argue are better than the originals. I think you can add Terminator 2 Judgment Day to that list. The Terminator was a blockbuster film and a sequel needed to be made. The story was too deep and detailed not to be made. The first movie mentioned John Connor a lot but obviously he wasn't born yet. This movie we see him as a kid and one of the most intense villains in movie history is out to kill him. Another version of the original Terminator also goes back in time to protect John Connor. We got an indestructible cyborg fighting another indestructible cyborg, yes please.\n\tOnce again the movie starts out with Arnold and the T-1000 going back in time, getting clothes and going after John Connor. The movie followed the same formula but Arnold is now the good guy, which I think is great. Arnold is given more material to work with and in the first one I said he was great as an emotionless robot and that was perfect because there was only one. Now there are two and his relationship with the kid is great. John's father is obviously dead and the Terminator plays the role as his father. Great, it worked, and I love how they even addressed is. I was a little worried about the kid because child actors can destroy a movie. I'm sorry but it's almost a proven fact but this kid worked. I didn't want to jump through the screen and kill him myself so there is a plus. The way he tried to make the cyborg \"human\" and gave him some personality was great because that is probably what would have done. He gives Arnold the idea of another memorable line that millions of people around the globe impersonate. \"Hasta la vista, baby.\"\n\tThe T-1000, this guy is awesome. The first time he kills somebody with his metallic arm sword I almost pooped my pants, really. This guy knows how to kill somebody and he is stronger than Arnold was in the first movie, and more deadly. The only reason I think he wasn't as good s because he basically acted the exact same as the first one. He played the emotionless bad guy and is the heartless robot, cool, but it's been done. I'm glad he was the way he was but I like the original better. \n\tWhen we first see John he lives with his foster parents making the audience ask the big question, where is Sarah Connor? Well, she is in a mental institution and her character has been completely transformed into a crazy killing machine. She is crazy. Perfect. I did not expect that but the road they went down worked perfectly. The end of the world and the fact that her son is the only hope of the human race gets to her and she lost it. Props to the actress too for bringing this character to life. She is delusional with her seeing Reece and her dreams of the actual end of the world. The scene where she is at the park behind the fence and the bombs go off is actually scary. The first time I saw it I was scared.\nOne of the best moments in the movie she tries to escape, the lights go out, Arnold walks through the door in slow motion, and Sarah flips out. That entire scene was suspenseful and turned into an action packed car chase with guns blazing. I really liked Sarah in this movie and is my favorite character. I really liked the kid, Arnold was a lot better, but Sarah takes the cake. Her relationship with John is a little weak and is lacking but it's understandable because she is off her rocker. \nThere are great characters and the action is better than ever but how is the story? Hmmmm, better than ever. The story in the first one was so good because of the back story and learning what happens in the future so how can they top that? How about preventing the future? Yes! In T2 we learn all more about Skynet and how the end of the world happens so the whole point of the movie is to prevent Judgment Day. The idea alone is hard to wrap my brain around. I am a sucker for a mind blow and nothing blows my mind more than time and time travel. \nFinally, we come to the action. The first movie had great action and special effects for the 80s and this tops that by a lot. The T-1000 takes a shotgun shell and looks like a soda can that got shot and he morphs back together like a jellyfish. I can imagine the 1991 audience with their jaws dropped, mine almost did. The Terminator is in its skin a lot more, meaning Arnold gets more screen time and the cyborg skeleton isn't fully shown. I liked that that and seeing one real eye any the creepy red eye is really cool. The car chases are better than ever and the explosions are great to. I understand John didn't want Arnold to kill people but there is one scene where Arnold is blowing up cars and using a minigun and there is no way he didn't kill anybody.\nOverall, Terminator 2 Judgment Day is a goldmine. Almost everything worked and it is one of my favorite movies. James Cameron is one of those directors who can mesh action and story really well. In most, if not all of his movies he can have great characters and special effects to back it up. It is very rare a sequel can be better than the original movie but there is no question about T2 and there is no question that Terminator 2 gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",

That Cameron, he sure does know how to make a good sequel, and he does not disappoint here. This film boasts the greatest special effects of its time, proving to stand the test of time very well since the effects were far ahead of their time to begin with. The performances are once again terrific: Arnold Schwarzenegger's new T-800 is now the good guy and proves to be pretty badass doing so, plus gives the character an ironic bit of humanity through his relationship with John Conner (even if I did prefer Arnold as the merciless killing machine in the first film, it's nice to see the tables turn and have the best of both worlds, so to speak). Linda Hamilton's Sarah Conner has been hardened by the truth of the inevitable bleak future that faces mankind and is now as cold as the Terminator that tried to kill her, and therefore, gives a much stronger performance (an interesting switch, I thought). Robert Patrick as the T-1000 is as cold and calculated as the T-800 in the first film, thus making for a great villain. And last but certainly not least, Edward Furlong gives a convincing and rather heartfelt portrayal of John Conner, despite the inexperience due to his young age. The only gripe I really have with this film is that it lacks the gritty bleakness of the original film and feels more like an upbeat action film (the action is still great though, nonetheless). But despite this, the actors fantastic performances and Cameron's great sense of direction give the film heart, preventing the film from becoming a mindless explosion fest. Plus, the film touches more upon the thought-provoking philosophical questions that the original raised and that make the series so substantial. Overall, in my eyes, this is easily one of Cameron's best films and almost as good, if not as good, as the original.",

Arnold Schwarzenegger this time depicts a good guy and delivers a terrific performance, while also allowing the other actors to shine in their own moments. Robert Patrick depicts the villainous T1000 and steals the show whenever he appears. The special effects are highly improved from the first, while the story is also much more epic, putting forth further questions and answers, while also delivering more incredible action scenes. The film also ends with the possibility that maybe this franchise was better as two films, instead of continuing it with further sequels without James Cameron.

In 1984, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) was originally targeted for termination but failed. Eleven years later, her son John (Edward Furlong), who is ten years old, is now the new target when Skynet sends a much more advanced Terminator called The T-1000 (Robert Patrick), that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s composed with \u00e2\u0080\u009ca mimetic polyalloy\u00e2\u0080\u009d liquid metal that can take shape or appearance from anything it touches, while the future John sends a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), identical to the one that tried to kill Sarah, to protect his younger self and attempt to prevent Judgment Day. I was two years old when it came out in July 1991 and it was first out of all the films I saw when I was probably eight years old. I would sometimes have to imagine Christian Bale, who later goes on to play John Connor in TERMINATOR SALVATION, watching this movie when he saw it on the big screen when he was seventeen years old. Robert Patrick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s T-1000 is one of my favorite movie villains, next to Jeremy Irons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Scar and Jim Carrey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Riddler. I remember almost everybody from my high school preferred T2 than T1 and T3, and this were before T4 came out; maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of Arnold playing the \u00e2\u0080\u0098good\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Terminator. The 1st one is a classic, but TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is, hands down, the best out of all the Terminator movies.",

The nemesis is a new series of robot, the T1000 played by Robert Patrick who lifts the perils to a new level playing a liquid metal robot who can mimic any object it touches.\nThe pacey direction from Cameron continues over from the first film.  That man knows how to tell a story.  Linda Hamilton this time plays a much tougher character.

From the moment they introduced her new \"BA\" personality in T2, obviously the result of her experience in T1, I couldn't take her seriously. At all. The acting, even for the time, is way off in my book. It's laughable how much they try to make her an action heroine a la Sigourney Weaver in the Alien franchise. It's super distracting.\n\nBut, that aside the movie is great. Strong performance from the child actor, Edward Furlong. His character  represents everything that is a 1991 kid, and his dialogue is nostalgic. I liked the humanizing of Schwarzenegger's character: a complete 180 from the cybernetic killer from T1.\n\nPersonally, I think the movie dragged on a bit. I found myself getting anxious to do something else about 2 hrs in. But, T2 put an emphasis on character development which pushed the climax with the antagonist further down the plot. If I'm going to get picky, I would also add that the antagonist of T2, while iconic and scary as all hell, was MIA for large chunks of the movie, as opposed to in T1, where Schwarzenegger was nipping at your heels around ever corner. I think the antagonist's impact was lessened a good deal because of it. I found myself thinking towards the end: \"Oh yeah. I forgot about that guy.\"",

An action level at the top of the range, with fantastic scenes and real, and with impressive visual effects for its time, with an intriguing and fun story.\nSchwarzenegger devastates with its role in the 1st movie he saw as a killing machine in service of evil, in this one, we see him as a machine of destruction trying to save the world.\nIn my opinion, this is one of the best (if not the best) action films ever made, pure fun, with a litlle of drama and a intriguing story.",

Edward Furlong is certainly the weak link of the cast, but he gives an earnest (if sometimes annoying) performance that hits the right beats when necessary. Here's a movie that puts story and theme first, and uses incredible makeup, puppetry, and early CGI to great effect. The ending is a real tearjerker. The gold standard of Hollywood blockbusters.",

But what makes it all interesting is the hefty relationship between punky Furlong and machine Schwarzenegger (who is or isn't incapable of emotion). The stars are played with gusto, and film has some terrific action set pieces and an overall grand exuberance, but unsympathetic characters ring it hollow (and the startling freshness of the original is absent).

The movie is very cleverly set up and plays with your expectations, keeping you on your toes and consistently surprising you. It turns up the juice on everything that was good about the first film and switches the genre from a horror film to an action film. To back up this change, James Cameron utilizes cutting-edge special effects that still hold up today. You can find a little bit of everything here blended seamlessly, from puppetry, to computer generated imagery, to prosthetics and miniatures. There's three great car chases, several great adversaries for our heroes (so for our likeable heroes we have numerous villains that more than fit the role), some very funny moments and a lot of brains too. The film asks a lot of smart questions like \"what makes us human\" and \"can you judge someone for something they haven't done yet?\" but introduces these subtly, so you're distracted by the gunshots and explosions and then when it slows down a bit you realize that you just heard a whole lot of intelligent dialogue too. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their roles and they're even better the second time around. It's without a doubt one of the great time travel films and a great action film so treat yourself and give this one a watch. (Extended Edition on Dvd, January 30, 2013)",

It's as good as the first, which is something very few sequels can claim. There's a lot of cool stuff going on in this film, from the T-1000 to endless action. It all works extremely well in keeping the viewer glued to the screen. The story in this one may even be slightly more intriguing than that of the first. \n\nIn T2, Sarah Connor begins in a mental hospital because of her ranting and raving about the approaching Judgement Day. Her son, John Connor is under the care of some foster parents. Two Terminators come back to find John. Ones(T-1000) mission is to kill John Connor. The other(The Terminator, who was supposed to kill him in the first film), is rewired to protect John. The sweeping action and storyline is definitely a spectacle to behold as The Terminator and the T-1000 battle for the life of John. We also see a new addition to the film in bringing a human element to The Terminator.\n\nJames Cameron is obviously a skilled director and this and his first Terminator film may be the movies that define his greatness best. Sure, he's made other great movies, but for some reason these are the ones that stick in peoples heads the best. This movie is an exercise in visuals, in action, in suspense, and in pure filmmaking glory. It's perfect.\n\nT2 is one of those movies you just have to see before you die. There's not a second of downtime in the film and yet it's not just another mindless action film that puts blood and guns before character and plot. Instead, it combines the action and character, blood and plot to make an action movie that rivals the best to ever be made. It's truly that good, and if you don't believe me; just watch it. You'll soon be a believer.",

Sarah Connor does not have to face this terror alone, the human resistance has sent another terminator programmed to be just as implacable in its defence of the boy as the cyborg's foe in its mission to destroy man's last hope for survival.\n\nThe movie plays a grim future in which 3 billion human live will end on a nuclear war on 29 August 1997, a day which survivors will call judgement day.\n\nAll hell break loose in an extravaganza with special effects, making a spectacular movie which has broken all box office records.",

Arnie's Terminator is pitted against Robert Patrick as a shape changing robot that proves to be almost indestructible. Linda Hamilton brilliantly reprises her role as Sarah Connor here and grabs any acting credits that are on offer. She's great as the battle scarred, psycho-mum that is proved to have been right all along. There's a fair amount of chasing around giving Arnie plenty of opportunities to deliver those corny one-liners that have become his catch phrases. The budget for this movie was splashed around on state of the art special effects and huge explosions which make for a thrilling couple of hours as long as you don't examine the ludicrous plot too carefully. This is definitely one of those movies from the 90s that can rightfully be called a blockbuster and it still holds up today. If only they'd stopped here!",

Schwarzenegger's strong rough and tough character as Terminator Series 800 combined with timid scared Sarah and John makes one of the most outstanding cinematic casts against an undeniably evil and chemically-advanced villain, the T-1000, using strong special effects. In addition, the inclusion of Miles Dyson getting forced into destroy everything he has been determined to create enhanced the film's plot. This is a superior improvement over the first film, a rare accomplishment in Hollywood. In addition to being an improvement over the 1984 original and being a spectacular action blockbuster all about a little boy trying to save the world with his dangerously noble killer robot bodyguard, Rise of the Machines, Salvation and Genisys have never come close to matching the sheer brilliance and special effects of T2, which will always remain the best American action movie ever, no one can outdo it even if it again stars Schwarzenegger.\n\nJames Cameron seriously should have prioritized Terminator 3 and 4 over Avatar so that he could have prevented Rise of the Machines and Salvation from taking those positions in favor of better movies.",

In other to differentiate the two terminators a lot of visual and computer effects had to be used.  The first Terminator film was done in 1984 and fewer effects can be seen used to portray the Terminator character. Here in this 1991 sequel titled Judgement day more graphic effects had to be employed to portray the nature of the T-1000.\n\nThe T-1000 is a mimetic poly-alloy (liquid metal) structure, who has the ability of shape shifting into another human or morph into almost anything it touches. Such visual effects led to the movie winning Best Visual Effect in the Academy Awards and British Academy Film Awards.\n\nTerminator 2 follows the story of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who had an initial meeting with a Terminator who was sent back in time to kill her unborn son. Her son John Connor (Edward Furlong) who is now born and in his teen years, is also under a new threat a new, more advanced Terminator made of liquid metal and who is also a shape shifter a T-1000 Terminator (Robert Patrick) has been sent back in time to kill John and prevent him from becoming the leader of the human Resistance against the machines. \n\nTo help Sarah and John an old, less advanced Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) which Sarah had to battle with is also sent back in time to help them.\n\nCameron took the machine from the first movie, and made it to a machine with a purpose, the change from a villain to a hero is one that Schwarzenegger pulled off so well, making good use of his voice and his statue to pass the message that this T-101 is not someone you want to mess with.\n\nWith a whooping 94 million dollar production, Terminator 2: Judgement Day made over 500 million dollars in its theatrical run, making it one of the highest grossing movies in the world, and it holds a 98% approval rating in Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day is a classic Sci-Fi movie to own, watch and love. The perfection in the acting and the fun in the script made this movie one to place in the record books as one of the best movies of all time. \n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",
