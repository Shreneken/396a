    "summary": "This fall, everyone's favorite leche-loving, swashbuckling, fear-defying feline returns. For the first time in more than a decade, DreamWorks Animation presents a new adventure in the Shrek universe as daring outlaw Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet. Academy Award\u00ae nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Soft Paws (Oscar\u00ae nominee Salma Hayek). In their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided--against their better judgment--by a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perro (Harvey Guill\u00e9n, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldilocks (Oscar\u00ae nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, \"Big\" Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos).",

I was not expecting to like this movie as much as I did, especially because I have grown tired of spin-offs, sequels, and multiverses at the box office. However, this movie delightfully surprised me, and is great on it's own. I loved how like the Shrek franchise, other fairy tale characters are incorporated and modified in unique ways, like Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The animation was entrancing, and I enjoyed how the storyline addressed dark issues, such as death. Overall, this is a great film for children and adults alike, and I am excited to rewatch.",

It has wild half anime visual style, crazy action scenes, fairy tale craziness (although that shtick has dropped off since the original Shrek).  The humor is not wall to wall, but organic, and almost always lands.  But more importantly, it has more mature themes of coming to grips with mortality and life priorities.

Life lessons are learned in this movie and characters actually grow. For me the Wolf and Goldilocks really stand out but almost every character is worthy of a shout out.

It was the first movie that I watched twice in cinema which says something, can't wait for Shrek 5 hope they'll use the same animation and have an interesting plot.\n\nI really wish that we would see Kitty and Puss getting married in Shrek 5.",

Not the best movie, The Prince of Egypt and A Beautiful Day in The Neighborhood are the best movies I've seen, but Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is a must-watch. Even as someone who didn't like the first movie, I think this movie soars in every aspect. Puss, Kitty, and Perrito are a great cast of main characters, each of which feel grounded and entertaining at the same time. This movie having 3 villains could have made it feel overstuffed and like it was doing too much, but no one villain takes time from the others and they're all so well written. Jack Horner is a refreshing villain, he is completely irredeemable and evil, something that Disney should do more with its villains if they ever decide to have an actual villain again. Goldilocks and the 3 bears are incredibly sympathetic, well written characters, they're some of my favorites. Wolf was so threatening, generating chills any time he was onscreen. The animation of this movie is so stylized and gorgeous and puts what the first Puss in Boots did to shame. The music is great, \"Fearless Hero\" is one of my favorite songs from a movie, there's a reason everyone remembers this song after seeing this movie. I could go on and on, but you get the point. Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is an uncontested masterpiece, by far my favorite Dreamworks movie",

The reason it did not win an Oscar was because its animated style in some parts were too much like Spider-Man's multiverse animation movie. Which wasn't too good.

Behind all of the bright colours of the gorgeous animation, making all of the action scenes an absolute spectacle to feast your eyes onto, is a simple plot with an absolutely massive impact. \n\nThe story is light hearted enough so kids can get enjoyment out of it, but it also treats its audience with maturity, not playing safe and having the \u2018bravery' to insert extremely deep messages. One of which is the over-arching theme of mortality and how we need to appreciate what we have.\n\nThis theme is represented beautifully through its characters. The protagonist puss in boots learns how he has taken his lives for granted. He learns this through the other characters such as Perrito. \n\nAt first glance he seems like the clich\u00e9 annoying side character for comic relief, but turns out being a warm, friendly and extremely likeable little chap. The fact that he does not have a wish, along with some other character traits, shows us and puss how he is content with the life he has, and only looks forward to his simple dreams, letting the rest develop along the way. His dream is to become a therapy dog, which is an important detail to note further into the film. \n\nOf course I cannot review this movie without mentioning Death, one of the best animated villains I have seen in a while. He shows puss his hatred towards him for taking his lives for granted, and enjoys inflicting fear into other people. In his introduction scene he is extremely close to taking puss' final life, coming as close to a scar on his forehead, with one drop of blood slowly creeping down to his shocked face. (Another example of this film's maturity) in this scene we see puss experience true fear for the first time in his life, as he is petrified of dying right there, right then. This is the moment he comes to realise how much he has taken for granted, and it was all at the fault of this menacing wolf character.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there, he constantly torments puss, showing up throughout random parts of the film, in which every appearance, send massive chills down puss' and my spine, with his truly uncanny whistle. \n\nOne of these appearances leads to what is in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in the film. Puss begins to run away in a state of absolute to panic before coming to a stop. We see that he is struggling to breathe, and his vision is blurry. Perrito is the only one there, and without any dialogue, Perrito simply rests his head on puss' chest, and in a slow decent into calmness, puss regains his control. Perrito has completed his dream of being a therapy dog. The shear realism of this scene, along with the mature dealing of the situation is what makes this scene, and this film in general truly one of a kind. \n\nTo finalise, we also have many other great characters, most notably, Goldi the three bears, the redeemable villains who learn to appreciate their family, and Big Jack Horner, the pure evil villain who does not appreciate what he has at all, to which he learns to consequences. Overall he is an extremely funny character with a \u2018charming evil' to him. All of these characters are balanced out perfectly through the films perfect pacing. Nothing seems to drag on at all.\n\nTLDR:\nThis movie is an incredible creation. All the characters are amazing in their respected ways, the animation is a true spectacle of passion and creativity, and the plot is simple, but truly impactful with the balance of light hearted humour and the downright mature themes. \n\nPersonal experience:\nI have never felt so much towards a film before, the mature themes especially hit hard and really made me look over how I spend my one life. I would honestly not recommend this film to really young audiences, because this film is best experienced when you truly understand the mature tones and messages. I absolutely adored this film, and I hope you did as well.\n\nP.S. this is my first proper review of a film, so sorry if some parts are a bit confusing, and the pacing on this is no where near as good as the films lol. There's so much to say but I don't want this to be too long. But still if you made it this far, even if skipping to the TLDR, thanks for reading, hope i expressed my opinions well enough.",

I don't think I really have any real big problems with this film because the animation is super vibrant the characters are lively, even the villains, Jack and death are some of the best, animated villains or even just villains in general that I have seen in a long time there's a big complaint about this movie being too crowded but I think it's just fine. The first half really makes it feel like a Puss in boots film but by the end, it really flashes out all the other characters in Waze I didn't expect, and I love this film for doing that. I really don't know how Shrek five would top this but if it does, then respect because this film was incredible I don't think it's as good as Shrek two, but it is darn close also, I watch this film with my friend after I watch this film you'll never guess what I watched after I watch this film again for a second time it's that good 9/10",

Death is an extremely dark villain and there is some bleeped swearing but that makes this movie the best. This movie took risks and after being stuck in hell for years.

It takes a character you've probably never heard of despite being a real poetry character \"Little Jack horner\" and turns him into a heartless villain with no tragic backstory, just straight up evil, and it makes his character really funny, while still having other villains that have motives like goldilocks, who wants to have a real family, and death who wants to take puss's life because he doesn't appreciate it.

They did a wonderful job telling the story. Even the parts I initially thought would be annoying were great. It was perfectly balanced and had such good messages throughout. \n\nThis movie reminds you to appreciate life and what you have, to live in the moment, to make the most of the time you have, to not let fear control you but that it is ok to be afraid sometimes you just need to work to overcome it. It supports strong family connections, whether that family is biological or not. The antagonists/villains are superb.  It's really funny but still gives the emotional moments time to breath. And this is from a sequel movie to a spinoff about a swashbuckling cat. \n\nSo many movies are the equivalent of junk food and we just keep accepting it and getting more of the same.\n\nMovies like this need to be praised and supported. It's the only way to send a message that we are tired of the constant junk thrown at us.\n\nEnormous thanks to everyone involved with the creation of this gem.",

Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Florence Pugh, Harvey Guill\u00e9n, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura they're all just fantastic. I was genuinely invested in the characters and not solely on nostalgia. not that this film does a few callbacks but those aren't some cheap fan-services but something that add a little substance to the greater story.\n\nnow, the animation and the cinematography. ughhhh, it's so freaking beautiful !!! spiderverse swung in style so puss in boots could land perfecttly on it's feet. there is clearly inspiration for the animation here but instead of some cheap rip-off, it really feels like an artistic choice and comes off as an artist's fairytale come to life here. the movie literally starts with the words \"this is a fairytale...\" and lives up to it! the cinematography too is something to look out for. this film haz better shots than I can spot in a big budget Hollywood blockbuster these days. DreamWorks atleast never fails in that department and always manages to exceed expectations!\n\nto be honest, I wasn't really expecting anything from this film because the shrek cinematic universe has been near-dead for so long, but this film gives me hope. this film gives me something to put my faith in. you'd think that years of development hell would usually mean bad for a film but not for PUSS!... IN BOOTS!\n\njust go and have a good time with this. and if you haven't yet seen the trailer for the film, don't do it. just go into the film blindly like I did. It will surely give you a few surprises! in my opinion, this is the best film in the Shrek Cinematic Universe since Shrek 2, which isn't saying a lot, but it should since Shrek: Forever After was the only good film after Shrek 2.\n\nP.S.: the new DreamWorks intro is so good. I just love it!",

When he come on screen and the whistling just gave me chills it was perfect, its was like i were being hunted by the one and only death like i can feel the fear he carries. Great project for a kids movie, it add a lot of story to puss like the way he revealed his true colors at the end of the movie and the friendships he have along with the adventures he have, showing that puss is a huge character in the Shrek universe even one of the strongest he last against death in a battle. I really like how they end the movie, SPOILERS they way death gave him a chance at life because he showed who he really is and hes not that overconfident guy who think he can work alone, he shows that he have heart. Death was no longer searching for that same guy anymore he saw his true self i love that, instead of just making it where they made death surrender or die OR show that hes weak. The moral of the story and the text make a lot of sense and was inspiring truly an experience.\n\nThe villain in this movie is really scary and the whistling sound that he make gave me chills. I could feel the fear that he carry, like I was being hunted by Death himself. This movie is a great project for kids because it add a lot of story to Puss in Boots' character. We see him reveal his true colors at the end of the movie, and the friendships he have along with the adventures he go on. This show that Puss is a huge character in the Shrek universe and even one of the strongest because he last against Death in a battle.\n\nI really like how the movie end.

The moral of the story and the text make a lot of sense and was truly inspiring. The movie is a great reminder that it's important to show our true selves and that we can all change for the better.\n\nIn conclusion, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a great movie that you should definitely watch. The story is engaging, the characters are interesting, and the villain is truly scary. The movie add a lot of depth to Puss in Boots' character, showing that he's a strong and complex character in the Shrek universe. The movie's ending is satisfying and inspiring, reminding us of the importance of being true to ourselves. If you're a fan of Shrek or just looking for a great family movie, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is definitely worth a watch.",

It doesn't harp on at the audience; it doesn't lecture, and it doesn't reiterate the typical \"environment good, white men bad\" rhetoric that Disney has been repeating since they turned awful. Puss carries a genuinely essential and universal message about making the most of your life, overcoming hardships and bad luck and coming out all the stronger for it with an appreciation for what you have. It may be hard for modern audiences to relate to putting others' needs before your own instant selfish gratification, but it's nice that that's also a theme.\n\nIt's fantastic, and I would love to see more studios returning to a more wholesome and honest approach to making movies.

            "content": "I watched the movie for the first time a little under two months ago and can I just say, I was in awe. I was in Florida, visiting my grandparents for vacation and it was one of the first things I wanted to do with my grandma while there. I had heard a lot of praise for the movie from my friends (age range 14-20) and since I'm an enjoyer of animation in the first place, I went to go see it. Now, I will say I went into this with little background of how the first movie went - I had watched it once, and that was several years prior. Good thing about The Last Wish, though - you don't need too much background information, so to an extent it can work as a standalone movie if you really want it to be. Going into the actual movie, WOW! The animation was absolutely stunning. They definitely took a lot of inspiration from Into The Spiderverse regarding the animation, mixing the 2D and 3D together. I've seen several reviews saying that made it \"hard to watch\" or \"look cheap\", but it was quite the opposite, quite dynamic! It was also very colorful and very detailed, but not too much so - \"just right\", as Goldilocks would say. Speaking of Goldilocks: regarding the characters, I think they were also very well done. It's easy to root for Puss, he's not one of those protagonists that you get bored and annoyed with, especially with Kitty and Perrito supporting him in his leading role. The villains of the movie were also very well done: Death (the wolf) was quite ominous and accurately embodied Death, \"straight up\". Goldilocks was a flawed character rather than an actual evil one, and it was nice that her story and wish was resolved at the end in a sweet way, though I will say if I have any critiques at all you could see that from a mile away. Jack Horner, though being the most unapologetically evil character, is also one of the funniest and most memorable of all. Killer design, funny lines, John Mulaney did such a great job voicing him. In fact, all of the voice actors and actresses were flawless - they fit their characters and fit the tones perfectly. \nA lot of reviews against this movie say it's too dark, but I think that's what makes this movie so beautiful. Yes, one of the main topics is mortality, and if that's not something you are ready to talk about with your child - assuming that's who you're going to bring to the movie - then do not bring them. However, if you want them to be able to discuss and see the topic of mortality in a healthy, safe way, this is definitely the movie for you. A lot of media these days struggles in how to discuss death. I think The Last Wish definitely illustrates how ominous and scary the topic of death may be, with its personification of death (the wolf character). At the same time, Puss is able to tackle his fear of death in the end. \nAll things considered, this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park. There is so much to enjoy out of this movie, from humor, fun characters, sweet moments, dynamic fight scenes (which do NOT take up the whole movie, by the way!), absolutely GORGEOUS animation, and a killer soundtrack that doesn't get enough credit...and of course, the fact that there is a lot to think about after watching it. \nI highly recommend this movie. Treat yourself and/or your loved ones and go watch it.",

While I admit the Wolf may be slightly too scary for the age range it appeals to in its more vibrant child-like audience, I think it fits into a wider family film that has its laughs for the kids while not being afraid to make an emotional effect on the grown-ups. Kids and grown-ups love this film alike, just what a FAMILY film should do. Family films are now more kid's films that grown-ups watch out of necessity, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is hopefully the start of animation going back to being a family occasion and not just a kids-only appeal. Dreamworks could be onto the renaissance of animation, and if the same team is working on Shrek 5, I am definitely on board.",

            "content": "This is the first time where I have seen the audience scores aligned with the critic scores. Normally, I would say critic scores are trying to be cooperate-friendly and be as nice as possible to the movie(the exact opposite of what a critic is ironically), but I have to say, the critic and audience score is very justified. I may or may not update this post, because I have only seen this movie once.\n\nSo right now, I am going to be upfront, and write my critiques out of the way so I can talk about the good stuff after.\n\nSo, I don't know if it's the effects of my sensory issues and loud movie theater speakers clashing, but it induced a bit of anxiety in me. It could've just be the first few minutes kind of rushing through along with other effects, or it was just loud speakers and my sensitive ears colliding. I really don't know, I would have to rewatch so other time to see. The first few minutes are kind of just a fuzzy memory to me.\n\nI also don't know why they didn't just address the problem between Puss and Soft-paws earlier in the movie. There isn't necessarily anything bad about it, but I feel it would've been better addressed earlier.\n\nThat's really my only concerns, not even a problem really.\n\nI think that all the villians are all pretty solid for there being multiple villains. You know what. Scratch that. They aren't just solid villains. They are all really good villains. Plain an simple. \n\nJack Horner isn't trying to be relatable at all. He doesn't have some sad back story that tries to get you to sympathize with him. He is just pure evil. He believes only he should be entitled to his power, doesn't give a damn about anyone else, and would do anything to get what he want, even if it means needlessly putting others lives at risk, even those who dedicate there services to him. It is a bit more refreshing to see that we aren't being guilt tripped through a story, and we are being shown that evil isn't made because of bad things. It can just be made in anyone, regardless. Plain and simple. \n\nHe also isn't 2 dimensional either. He might not have a conscious telling him what right and wrong is, but you are shown he has a reason for doing it, even if you don't understand his ideologies or reasonings. It is showcased in ways that you understand what he is doing and why. He knows that once he gets his hands on the power, no one will be able to stop him anyway, and he is confident he can get it.\n\nOhhh\u2026 and death. Death is just amazing to watch on screen. He literally gave me the chills anytime he was on screen, and I love it. That's how you right a villain. When his presence on screen is so intense, that you get chills just seeing him. He is just a badass. Through and through. Nothing else. And I don't mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way. He is a total badass. Straight. Up.\n\nHe has so many memorable quotes, I just can't help but reference them as I am writing this review! He is genuinely that fun and memorable as a villain!!! \n\nHe also has a motive that isn't just clear like Jack Horners, but you understand why. And you don't just understand why, his motives are almost justified. You almost root for him at times.\n\nNot to mention Puss in Boots arc where he goes from arrogant ass who doesn't truly value his lives until he realizes he doesn't have any to lose, to one who would like to spend his life wisely and happily, realizing what life is.\n\nEveryone going after the wish has a reason to go after the wish, and then they realize they had what they wished for, and it's just so good. It shows that you could learn to look at what you have and not take it for granted.\n\nI could go on for hours and hours why this movie was such a good movie. But I bet you probably came here for a shorter review just to see if this movie. You didn't come for a whole essay. So I am going to cut it short here and save everyone including myself time. This movie is going to be one of the highest ratings I may ever give to a movie. It's that good. Watch it as soon as possible.",

His menacing presence and cunning tactics make him a worthy adversary for Puss in Boots and his new allies.

And the addition of new allies like Dulcinea (voiced by the delightful Tiffany Haddish) adds depth and heart to the story.\n\n\u0e07\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be a DreamWorks movie without stunning animation and plenty of humor. \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" delivers on both counts, with breathtaking visuals and plenty of laughs to keep audiences of all ages entertained.\n\nIn a world where animated movies are a dime a dozen, \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" stands out as a true gem.

This movie was one of the last movies that I thought was going to be really good but I'm very happy that it went above and beyond what I thought it was going to be. The story is pretty cliche and generic yes but it's everything around the story that makes this film so good. The animation is incredibly. The Spider-Verse style works very well for this film and it still stands out from Spider-Verse in its own unique way. The characters and their own respective arcs are great. There really isn't one weak character here. Puss himself gets some excellent development and his journey of grabbing with the concept of death is very emotional and well written. Kitty Softpaws also has a really good arc and chemistry with Puss and Perrito has some really great moments. All of the villains here are great. Goldilocks and the 3 bears all have a good arc and Jack Horner is one of the funniest characters ever included in an animated film and works amazingly well as the irredeemable villain but the real standout here is Death. Death is probably one of if not the best Dreamworks villain. To have Death be personified and built up the way it is in the film is just something else. His interactions with Puss were always amazing. The humor was great as well. Pretty much every joke from Jack landed and all the other jokes were really great as well. Everyone involved with this film felt like they really cared about the characters and the story and that's what makes the film so great.

The animation was superb, with a slight action style that added a unique spark to the already beautiful visuals, which had such a variety of themes. Plus, the character design. I'm still getting over how amazing the wolf looked, absolutely horrifying but so fun to watch. The direction was one of the best I've seen in any animated movie, with stunning shots that I'm shocked other films haven't used. The worldbuilding was so compelling, with elements of fantasy and adventure so interesting and thought-provoking, and ideas so brilliant I've truly never seen anything like it. The voice acting was perfect, casting celebrities that are actually good at voice acting, and actors I've never seen before that still were great. The characters were set up so well, with emotional sequences and character building that was heartfelt and realistic, despite the movie being about talking animals and fictional creatures. The comedy was wonderful, with Disney parodies and fairy tale references, plus sequences that were extremely funny. There's practically nothing wrong with this movie- everything was so riveting and fun to watch, always entertaining you while keeping you in suspense. Overall, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, animated or not. I was invested throughout the entire experience, rooting for characters in their toughest moments, and genuinely tearing up multiple times. This movie is outstanding.",

It won't hurt wasting my time watching this.\" \nAfter I have watched this movie I had felt something which also occured to me when I watched: \"How to train your Dragon the Hidden World\" Other than the fact that the animation of the movie and the casting was just purely stunning, It really went sodeap. I never tought that I, who watches in my age World War movies and documenteries would feal such passion towards an animated movie. This movie made me watch \"The Adventures of Puss in Boots\" andthe original movie again. The love between Puss and Kitty or Puss and Dolcinea is for me even comparable with Hiccup and Astrid. There is so much to add to this movie. I couldn't imagine how someone wouldn't want to watch this movie. I would really recommend this mvoie for anyone, who is seeking to live his childhood life again.",

I didn't have high expectations - I decided on a whim to see it after two recommendations in separate, unrelated YouTube videos. I didn't even remember this is a sequel. Nevertheless, it was fantastic, and a fantastic standalone film. The animation style is delightful, and similar in many ways to Into The Spiderverse, with an overall painterly, comic book aesthetic and creative use of variable frame rate and colour. The story brilliantly balances real heart with cracking jokes. The characters are all super endearing and energetically acted - suave Puss and his old flame Kitty, effervescent Perrito, relentlessly, comedically cruel Jack Horner, surprisingly familial Goldi and her three bears, and the spectre following Puss everywhere. The story is interesting, taking someone who has grown to think himself untouchable and challenging him to stop thinking about himself for once, and along the way a loner learns to trust again, a dog with the saddest backstory finds a loving family, and an adopted child comes to appreciate her found family. So much else to love - the Shrek cameos, the touching portrayal of a panic attack, the in-universe theme song (\"He is your favourite fearless hero\"), the touches of anime in fight choreography.

I have seen very few films that have successfully nailed such a strong balance of comedy, action, poignant moments, and -- surprisingly -- legitimate horror; that TLW manages to pull this off while being a mostly-child-friendly animated film is deserving of praise. While it doesn't quite reach perfection, it comes remarkably close. A must-see for anyone with even a passing interest in animated films.",

I'm always an active critic, yelling in my mind on why the movie is terrible and unrealistic while I'm watching it, yet I didn't do that at all while watching this. \n\nThe story plot line is perfect, it is somewhat bit more fast paced but there is 0 filler or unnecessary moments. Each and every part seems to contribute to a lesson or meaning, and really builds each of the characters that we see in the short amount of time (less than 2 hours). The buildup is solid and the ending is amazing.\n\nThe voice acting is flat down some of the best I've ever heard for any animated movie, fantastic and describes each character exactly. I actually never noticed this about any other movies but it really stood out to me from this one. \n\nOverall the movie is a 10/10, from a solid critics viewpoint.",

            "content": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a masterpiece. The movie was over 10 years in the making and it shows. Not a single part of it feels rushed, forced, or poorly done. It has gotten stellar reviews on all fronts because the movie is flawless in every regard. It's no wonder that a fantastically executed depiction of one of the most consistently beloved characters in history makes for the greatest movie of all time.\nThe movie utilizes an animation style inspired by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a movie similarly praised by critics, nigh on universally for its fantastic art. Dreamworks used this same system in the production of Puss in Boots, another example of why the decade-long wait after its original announcement contributed to how truly spectacular the movie is. The painting-like style of art created an atmosphere that felt very much like a fairy-tale as opposed to the just-off-reality vibe that CGI movies of the past had, or the totally devoid of realism style of completely hand-drawn movies such as Aladdin or the Lion King. Dreamworks gave us the best that there is in the animated world by refusing to hold back on the art style. The fact that all movies with higher acclaim amongst critics happen to be live action only serves to illustrate why this movie isn't considered better by so called professionals.\n\tThis art-style helps contribute to the simply stunning fight scenes in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. However, the visuals are not the only thing that makes the swordsmanship in this movie stand out. Unlike other movies using swords, The Last Wish holds a great degree of accuracy to real life swordsmanship. In every single fight, it is clear who is attacking who, who is on offense, who is on defense. Puss can be seen parrying, and then counter attacking with a well executed riposte just like in real fencing. Puss' fight with Death at the end of the movie is the most spectacular fight throughout, with both characters showing off the true height of their ability, utilizing their respective advantages in speed, dexterity, strength, size, cunning, and more and not just pointlessly slapping sticks together between them. What's more, Puss' use of a so-called \u2018gatito blade' in his offhand, is highly consistent with the use of parrying daggers, which were quite popular in Italy and Spain for use in rapier fencing. Such historical accuracy is quite rare in TV shows and movies, and for it to be found in a children's movie where that is rarely a concern just goes to show how much effort was put into the movie. Finer details such as these serve to show just how great of flawless masterpiece this movie really is. What's more, every fight in the movie serves a purpose other than just violence for the sake of violence. They help create exposition, advance the plot, and develop characters, whether that be by showing \u2018Big' Jack Horner's ruthlessness, the strengthening of Three Bears familial bonds, or galvanizing Puss to be brave and value his lives and the time he has with his friends.\nThe message of the story is found in the final fight scene. Without having to be explicitly said, the message is still clear, you should cherish every second. The movie also has much to say about how it's ok to be afraid, a lesson many young boys, and all men really, need to hear. It has a flawless and nuanced depiction of a panic attack, something that can't be said for most movies, and shows us that we don't always have as much control as we thought we did, and that's ok. Therein lies the elegance of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. It is, at its heart, a children's movie, and therefore has the obligation to leave the audience with a clear and positive message. This is no easy task for a movie to accomplish without being heavy handed. Luckily, for the Last Wish, the movie is far from heavy handed, with every message in the story being flawlessly woven into the very essence of the movie, instead of being carelessly stapled on top like so many other movies do. The reward of being appropriate for all audiences and for leaving them all with a positive message is incalculable and one of the many reasons Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is greater than any other movie, despite their higher approval amongst critics.\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish is a work of art. It is not only accessible to all audiences, but entertaining to them as well. It surrounds a beloved character that is a known-quantity in his beloved status amongst all, and does him justice in innumerable ways. The movie's attention to detail, and sheer visual beauty set it apart from any other animated movie ever made, while its character development, positive messages, and ability to stay within a PG rating puts it far ahead the dark live action movies that dominate the highest rated spots amongst movie review websites. Dreamworks didn't hold back on this one and, on God, it shows.",

The animation style was refreshing for the franchise, the humor was more balanced with the character-driven story, and despite maintaining three different villains the film feels solid rather than clunky. Instead of frequent pop culture references and dodgy jokes that pad for time in the later Shrek films, this Puss in Boots sequel weaves the influences of classic Spaghetti Westerns and swashbuckler films with a family adventure storyline and affirmative, positive themes about appreciating life and those around you. It knows when to be lighthearted and when to be serious, and introduces us to one of the coolest original villains in family animation - a wolf embodiment of death - by not holding back on the menacing aura and instead focusing on it; hopefully the sense of danger will encourage other franchises to stop oversanitizing their films. If I were in the movie's target audience, it would probably be a film I would swear by for the rest of my life (sort of like Shrek 2), but in this case I'll just call it a very good family movie that came out of nowhere.\n\nI hope you're all ready for more Shrek because now it's basically guaranteed to happen. And they will likely be disappointing. (3.5/5)",

It seems like it brings back our childhood memories. Due to the technology, the animation is better than the last movie 10 years ago. Puss in Boots is a cat with boots, a brave hero with nine lives. The movie starts with a fighting scene, and he lost the eighth life in the opening battle, and he only has one life. He started to be afraid to die and he wanted to find the wishing star that can give him back his nine lives.\n\nOn his journey finding the last wishing star, there are a lot of adventures awaiting and he meet unexpected characters, the one is his lover and the other is a dog, he named him Pero or Perito which means dog in Spanish. His life story shocks to the audience, but he has positive thinking about everything he faced in his life. Apart from Puss in Boots, there are villains who are trying to find the wishing star. There is also a villain is the Big Bad Wolf named Death who is trying to take Puss in Boots's life instead of trying to find the wishing star. If you watch the whole movie, you will know Death is not a villain. The fighting scene between Death and Puss in Boots is epic. Every time Death appears, it makes my bone chill. His style and background music are so artistic.\n\nIt is interesting that who got the wishing star, and you will find out because it is unexpected plot twist. Overall, this movie is really good and more than a just fun cartoon movie that a family gather and watch. The animation style and the story line of the movie are great, and I want to say Puss in Boots is coming back with great success.",

And that's because it's a movie for everyone who's protagonist just happens to be your favourite fearless hero, Puss in Boots. \nI haven't seen a film deal with this theme so maturely in so long. The acceptance of one's own mortality being a reason to find things worth fighting for in your one life. \nPIB might be the best interpretation and dealing with said theme i have ever seen. \n\nAnd at the heart of it all is a film that doesn't take your time for granted, being around 100 minutes long, short for this current age of cinema, keeps the pace going whilst allowing for those slow moments to make you feel Puss' every thought and feeling on his latest adventure. \n\nAnd plenty of fun and entertainment to be had. \n\nNo matter how old you are, you need to go see this movie",

I watched 'The Bad Guys' , and thought it was definitely a new step for DreamWorks, as it showed us what animation can give if done correctly. Puss in Boots, The last Wish didn't just do animation correctly, it perfected it. It has a great story which at sometimes can be dark.  Great Character's with well written and each has there own charm. Humour which is funny for children and adults. And best of all, animation with heart, soul and passion put into it. Whether that be it's cinematography, backgrounds, characters, art style or world building, it's those little details like that, that have given animation itself a better name. It's movies likes these that gives me hope, that the animation  industry will wake up more, and realise that people actual want effort for a change, and not the same old way to make money.\n\nAnimation - 10/10\nStory - 9.5/10\nCharacters - 10/10\nHumour - 9/10\n\nFinal Score - 10/10",

I am one of those people who loved Shrek 1 and 2, deciding not to watch the sequels and spin offs after so when I heard about this Puss in boots movie, I wasn't jumping to see it. My partner saw the trailer and was eager for me to watch too. Once I'd seen the trailer I knew there was something special and different happening with DreamWorks this time!\n\nObviously the visuals were the no.1 thing that drew me to the film. I loved the inspiration they took from Into the Spiderverse. I also see a bit of Arcane and Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr fox! The fight scenes are epic like Attack on Titan.\n\nThe characters are hilarious, and I loved the themes that played throughout. If you've ever experienced anxiety or depression and have started therapy, this movie will probably stir up your emotions (hopefully in a good way). I absolutely recommend everyone see this movie. If DreamWorks keeps this creative team, I'd be excited to see what they'll make next. This is the kind of creation that Disney is falling behind on.",

However, the animation style wasn\u2019t better in my opinion. I know many people enjoyed the more cartoony style in this movie, but I think I prefer the older one. This one had frame rates that were slightly too low for me and sometimes the action felt like the theater was experience screen lag. I also appreciated the detail in the first one more.

I'm shocked at how spectacular this film was. It's nearly tied with Shrek 2 as my favorite Shrek related film, it's not quite as good, but it came pretty close. That alone should tell you how good it is. The animation has a \"Spider-Verse\" like feel,and the action scenes were spectacular. Now lets get to what EVERYONE is talking about, the villain, the literal personification of DEATH. Death is honestly such a scary villian for a kids movie. I was shocked at how intense and suspenseful his scenes were, everytime you heard his whistle, you new stuff was about to go down! I liked Jack Horner as a surprise villian, he's existentense was kinda spoiled by social media, BUT I won't spoil anything here. Goldie locks and the three bears were a fun addition. I'm shocked the film didn't feel overstuffed. Puss in Boots was very good, having to face his mortality and some heavy subject matters. Kitty Softpaws also had a good arc about trust(and the world trust wasn't said a million times like a certain Disney movie) Perito was a funny addition that never got annoying. I love how optimistic he was considering his backstory. This movies story was dark, about Puss being down to his last life and looking for the last wish, and Death hunting him down. This is a MUST SEE, for all ages. 10/10, one of the best DreamWorks and Shrek related films.",

Also goldilocks and the three bears crime family thing was weird in a good way they had some very heart warming moments like when Goldilocks said that she wants a real family and not the bears, the bears were sad to hear her wish but they agreed to help her later on Goldi saves kid bear while saying that the family she has is just right. Big jack horner not a lot to say casual rich power hungry character just that he is a maniac he doesn't care for his crew or anyone really besides himself and to my surprise he isn't annoying just a grown up child (sad backstory though). Death, there isn't really anything i can say about him that wasn't said before he is the perfect villain he terrifies Puss THE LEGEND who was \"never touched by a blade\" fear for for his life Puss ran away to Mama luna's cat house some time (story happens) Puss meats death while seeing his previous lives as they mock him for being a coward and not the legendary \"PUSS IN BOOTS\" and he keeps convincing himself that the wish will make him the legend once again and then Death arrives remembering their previous encounter Puss starts to run (he also saw Death when he kitty softpaws and the bear family jack horner fought for the map) he heard Death's and took off. Puss fights Death one last time but this time he appreciates his last life then Death leaves and he says to Puss \"You know we'll meet again right? I know Lobo (Lobo =Death) \" .so yeah good movie perhaps i jumped places hear but good movie Puss's relationship with Kitty is very good Perrito is amazing he is so positive that he doesn't realize that his tragic past is tragic. Good jokes very good fighting scenes (similar to \"spider -man :into the spiderverse)\nGo watch it in the theater it is the best movie now 12/2/23 for the American 2/12/23 it is worth a watch in the theater make this movie earn why it deserves which is more the Avatar way of the water\nOne of the best movies i have ever seen a 10/10 for what it's trying to be and a 10/10 for a movie",

(Obviously, they don't use the words, it's just a bleep.)\nThe violence is very cartoonish. The main villain might spook a child under the age of five.",

Puss in boots is at its core a story about the idea of \"laughing in the face of death\" and coming to terms with our undeniable mortality and a story of living your one (or nine) lives the best you can. It's a story that juggles anxiety and panic attacks paired with the feeling that death is looming around you constantly, waiting to strike. And it's a film about what fear does to you and what it does to your relationship and your life\n\nPuss and boots starts with Puss going on a normal adventure,  throwing a party and then killing a giant. But then he dies. Which he seems completely unfazed by until he realizes he's on his last life. And is prescribed \"retirement.\" \n\nI've never been a fan of the dreamworks art style. Its just never stood out to me. But with Puss In Boots  The Last Wish  I genuinely enjoyed the way they animated it. Their use of the more 2D art style in a mostly 3D animated film was gorgeous and definitely did more than offer a nod to Spider-Man into the spiderverse. It genuinely excites me that one of my favorite animated films, Spider-Man into the spider verse, could be having such an effect on animation and the industry. The animation in Spider-Man into the spiderverse genuinely made me so happy and I thought the scenes were absolutely gorgeous. I've been animating for multiple years now and I've won competitions for my animation and I LOVE animation analysis and both of these movies really stand out to me.\n\nNot only is this movie gorgeous but it's also smart. This movie,as I said, tackles bigger topics and enthralled you with its gorgeous animation but it also appeals to the right audiences. Because of course it's a kids film so kids are going to watch it but who's taking them to the movies? Adults. How do you appeal to adults?\" That's a question the animation industry has been looking at for years. They've tried things such as, more adult jokes, which the shrek universe is famous for. But in the end they just feel like cheap laughs. I took my dad and my sister to see Puss In Boots the first time I watched it and my dad genuinely laughed at parts. He found lots of teh humor amusing such as, The Jiminy cricket sketch and the Goldilocks dynamic. This movie appeals to lots of people and does it well. ANd they have the numbers to prove it.",

It's an absolute pleasure to watch and I recommend it to everyone.\nThe story is great, despite being an animated movie deeply connected to ones made previously for children, it doesn't sway from tackling more deep and challenging problems. The main characters go through a lot in this movie and it is reflected by their behaviour.\nThe sound design is immaculate, certain sound cues being played at perfect times to signal danger, fear, or comfort. It is perfect to the point of the whistling one character does becoming very iconic, and every time it appears you know they are near.\nThe animation is top notch, workers at DreamWorks clearly putting in a lot of effort to create the best in a long time. Characters move through the environment clearly, interacting with it as they go, making us feel like they really are there instead of just being pasted in later. The animation is fluid, so when an enemy moves with less frames per second you can tell they are dangerous and clunky, and when later the same animation style is done to the main character while escaping you know they are the ones in danger. The animators doing little tricks like the one previously mentioned shows just how skilled they are in the art.\nThe characters are all memorable, each one's personality being very defined and different from the other's. This leads to some conflicts but also is a nice way for them to interact without it feeling forced. The new additions to the cast - the little dog, the main villain and others don't feel shoe horned in, instead feeling simply like extensions of the world we just haven't seen before.\nThis movie was masterfully done in all aspects, and I cannot recommend it enough to everyone. You should most definitely watch it or you'll miss out on one of the most amazing movies I've seen in a while.",

It's a very good character who makes sense for the plot and other characters evolution. The villians - BASE! Both Jack Horner and Wolf catch the eye, it was so brave to do that serious villians, I respect that. The animation, the music, the drama, side characterrs, locations designs, jokes, Shrek and farytales references - I noticed that all, and all authors hard work. Dreamorks is back on track and ready to meet Disney on the animation battlefield again, like back in early 2000s.

The visuals were a stunning mix of 3D animation, watercolor, and that Spiderverse-ey style.\n\nAs far as story goes, it serves its purpose of humbling Puss and develops his character in a believable way while still keeping him as the same lovable feline.\n\nI admit, I initially thought Perrito would have been the stereotypical annoying Kevin Hart side character, but I couldn't have been more wrong. He was surprisingly lovable and endearing. He even helped Puss through a panic attack in the same way REAL therapy dogs do. \n\nJack Horner was absolutely hilarious, Goldilocks and the three bears were surprisingly wholesome, and Death filled me with pants-shitting fear every time I heard his whistle.\n\nPuss in Boots: the Last Wish is altogether an incredible movie, 100% a must watch.",

John Mulaney fits the role for jack horner, and Death sounds so good! every character feels like if the animation speaks without any person voicing it! mouse syncing is very good too!\nVillains: 11/10, no explanation here, Wait no, 11+/10 it's not gold IT'S DIAMOND!\nAnimation: Animation is SUPER GOOD! like how they use a similar style with one of the best movies out there, Spiderman into the spiderverse! but instead of making the visuality looks like a comic book, they made the visuality looks like a fairy tale book, it looks so bright and actually give that art made out of paint/ fairy tale book vibe!\nPlot: 12+/10, the plot is what brings together this magnificent movie, so no explanation same for the villain!\nAction: 100/10 this is like an anime type of combat/fighting, fast paced, effects that is more likely to make you watch every single part of the scene and sounds in those scene are so satisfying!\nSoundtrack: 8/10 fearless hero is a banger, my favorite out of the bunch is horner heist, no context.",

Okay, a kids movie about a cat with boots was not one I expected to hit every single mark I have in order for a movie to be considered \"great.\" \n\nAnd yet, here I am.\n\nEverything about this movie is really phenomenal. I wasn't going to go see it, but heard good things and thought, \"well, I haven't been to the theaters in a while. Why not?\" So glad I did. I will be going again. The storytelling is literally PERFECT (or puurfect? ...sorry). It doesn't treat the audience as stupid, everything just flows so perfectly, and there's no lecture telling us what the moral of the story is--instead, the movie trusts in its own ability to tell a story. The villain/s are fun and interesting. The humor actually lands. I actually cried. Who knew an animated movie about a cat would bring me to tears?\n\nThis movie hits home on so many levels, addressing so many raw, human fears that are incredibly relatable. It has a good moral, and good sub-morals. And it's fun. It's so much fun to watch. Highly recommend. I'll definitely be buying this on DVD when it comes out.",

It set the tone for the whole rest of the movie.  All the clever humour and emotion that appealed just as much to the adult audience was gone and replaced by Hanna-Barbera type cartoony action.  Maybe mildly entertaining only for kids below the age of 7.  Also without meaning to sound ageist, Banderas and Hayek's voices were simply too old and croaky to be fitting for the characters, unfortunately sounded more suitable for grandad/grandma type characters.",

Death. every single time he was on the screen he stole the show. from the design to backstory and his signature eyrie whistle the designers knew exactly what they were doing by making Death as bad ass as he is. \n\nthe story and characters all though excellent would not have been as marvelous if the animators stuck to the original Shrek style. instead, they overhauled it and went with a much more spider verse style which perfectly complemented the story and action to a tee. i love that the company understood what made the last puss in boots movie so flawed and set out to make perhaps one of what must be the pinacol of animated movies up there with the likes of how to train your dragon and toystory. everyone i went to watch this with was talking about the animation and characters for hours after our first watch and i personally can not wait to watch it again as well as draw some fan art for this movie \n\nDreamworks pride yourself on a movie made perfectly and please keep up the top work. additionally if i could give you a higher score i dam well would.",

Perrito, the dog character, is so beautifully written it's amazing how you can sense the pain through his innocence (any person who has a dog can see the innocence in him). I found myself laughing out-loud right after having cried, and there are very very few movies out there that can do that to you. \n\nThe new anime-inspired fight scenes add beautifully to the overall artistic rendition, and the writing is just top-notch. Nothing to say about the voice-acting. From Banderas to Moura and Hayek, it's just perfect. \n \nI don't give reviews often, but it is an absolute must-watch (watching the first movie helps keep track of the story, so it's also recommended.) 10/10",

The action sequences were so quick and comic-like, and the colors popped. Beyond the look, the story was quite good as well. Dreamworks picked a good handful of messages to deliver and they did it well. I especially liked the arc with Goldi and the Bears, but the very real and very persistent personification of Death was also\u2026fun? Maybe not the word, but I was very interested. There was a great blend of heart and humor and the voice cast was outstanding, especially Florence Pugh and John Mulaney.

There is some excellent combination of 3D animation with 2D styles that I have not seen before. The combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than I was expecting. Action was top notch with some incredible set pieces and superb choreography.\n\nThe Last Wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated children's movie. Death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here. From panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. The journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members.\n\nWith most DreamWorks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. I did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. This would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.\n\nI genuinely believe that this movie has restored the Shrek universe and can propel the future projects upward. Hype has officially been restored for Shrek 5!\n\nScore: 86%\nVerdict: Great",

            "content": "The only explanation I have for all the positive reviews this movie is getting is that most of them come from adults who watched it with teens or without children. We went to the cinema with a group of 6-10 year old children (trusting the \"6 and above\" rating this movie got in Germany) and it was an awful experience for them.\n\nCopious amounts of violence (some cartoonish and played for laughs, some way too intense for kids), references to and portrayals of gambling & alcohol, a lot of swearing & rude language (sometimes censored, sometimes not), references to animal abuse (partially played for laughs) and an anthropomorphic wolf character who symbolizes death and who's significantly too terrifying for young children. Multiple kids in the cinema started crying, had to be escorted out of the hall, or had to close their eyes for large stretches of the movie. At one point a character calls another character a \"p*ssy\" - which is a somewhat lame cat pun in the original English, but in German that's lost in translation and ends up being straight up vulgarity that has no place in a movie rated 6+. Beyond those crassly child-unfriendly elements, the plot of the movie and the underlying themes (living the life you got, facing death & fears) were neither interesting to nor understandable for our kids. Another issue was the fake Spanish accent of the main character. Since we saw the movie in German I can't judge the original voicework, but in the German version the main character was sometimes very difficult to understand even for the adults.\n\nThis movie illustrates a larger problem: age ratings have become practically meaningless, and we essentially need to pre-screen every single movie we're considering to show to our kids to make sure it's actually age-appropriate and won't cause pedagogic issues. In this case, trusting the German film rating board (the FSK), reading reviews and watching the trailer beforehand was evidently not enough, and we regret taking our kids to this movie. Thank you, FSK, for deciding that a movie that makes our kids leave with the mental image of someone drowning a puppy in a river is appropriate for ages 6 and above... \ud83d\ude44\n\nThose issues aside, from an adult perspective this movie was thoroughly \"meh\". The comic-book animation style was neat for the first few minutes, but became jarring later on since it was applied very inconsistently. The plot was somewhat bland and the characters didn't really stand out (with the possible exception of the dog). The side-plot of the bear girl and her adopted family felt tacked on, and the ending felt somewhat satisfying but very telegraphed. Most of the jokes weren't offensively bad but didn't really land either, and most of the references just served to remind us of older, much better movies that we could have been watching instead. The quality of the voicework (keep in mind I'm talking about the German version specifically!) ranged from okay-ish to aggressively poor.\n\nDefinitely not a movie we're going to see again, and definitely not a movie we would have shown our kids had we known what we were getting into beforehand.",

The Soundtrack as well is outstanding! Every single song on the album is a worthy hit which deserves to be replayed again and again, don't believe me, go check it out on Spotify or YouTube! Anyway, as much as the film was a flavorful and visual expressive ball of energy, it knew the perfect moments to slow down and take in impactful moments, and allow their audience to take it all in. Which leads me to discuss the topic of the film, Mortality, and by the stars! They encapsulated it perfectly. I was moved, for I believe it is something all ages and walks of life can understand, the inevitable and looming presence which death holds within all of us. The anxiety which we hold until we too are at that pass which we face the inevitable. Nonetheless, we continue and decide to make the most of the single life we are given, to fight for the life we want with those we love and care for. I have not seen a film tackle such a hard and difficult subject in quite some time, and successfully I might add. In conclusion, this is an outstanding and captivating film which deserves to be talked about for years to come.",

This movie is about characters trying to get the wish they want and they are doing anything to get it but while Puss is trying to get his wish, we see how scared he is of the new villain Death and how much fear he gets. We can see how Puss is trying to get his 9 lives back while meeting his old wife and making a new friend to get the wish. At the end of this movie, we get to see how Puss matures and leaves the last wish while fighting Death to let go of the fear of dying. This movie is truly special and shows you not to be scared of something and to fight back.",

I even enjoyed watching several episodes of the TV series that followed, with my daughter, who is now 8-years old.\n\nThis sequel was disappointing on so many levels, not the least of which was: editing) it was too long; 2) story line -- a bit thin, even for an animated feature; 3) and this is the most important, the writers/directors didn't seem to understand the kind of film they were making. While I understand the nature of the Puss in Boots created for the first film (which I love), as being a heroic and hopelessly non-self-reflective figure (which makes him so wonderfully funny), the sequel seemed to think it was produced by Marvel Studios, filled as it was with over-produced action sequences that were simply boring and repetitive (hence the need to cut 10 minutes). \n\nThis will make a great case study in film school on how you take a sure thing and screw it up.",

I really like how this movie handled the theme of grasping onto your mortality and realizing what's actually important in life and that it's more than just \"living up to your own legend\". It really made Puss look a look at himself and forced him to realize all that he took for granted in favor of his pride. \n\nThe animation was great! I love it when animation strays away from hyperrealism and gets experimental like this. I wish more movies to be inspired by Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse and I want it to be a trend. Humans are very artistic creative!! We should express that more!\n\nMy only gripe is that while I actually enjoyed every character in this movie, I kind of wish the Bear family had less screentime or not exist at all in favor of focusing more on fleshing out Puss, Kitty, or Perrito. I was way more invested in those three than the B plot, but honestly the Bear family was enjoyable enough anyway. \n\nAll in all, I loved the movie and while I feel some of its potential was untapped I think this is a great step forward!",

The story itself was unexpectedly deep. I must say that, for a children's film, the themes and symbolism are all quite complex and powerful. If you are an adult watching with children, I strongly advise you to pay attention. The morals of the stories at the end are all very heartwarming.

Death is without a doubt my favourite villain to be brought to us definitely this year and possibly of the decade, leaving me a young adult even a little uneasy at times which is the only reason that this movie is getting anything below a 4 star rating as many parents were worried thinking that death was too terrifying for a PG movie, but please do not let this put you off as this movie is masterpiece.  Not only does it have amazing character development it also has amazing animation with dream works implementing a unique style to the movie with flashy colours.\n\nI'm conclusion I would without a doubt recommend this movie as a must see as I watched this movie about 2 weeks ago now and I couldn't get it out of my head how truly great this work was, even motivating me to write a review for the first time in hopes that more would take up the chance to experience this masterpiece with big releases like avatar overshadowing the movie when in my opinion puss in boots is a far greater movie than avatar was",

It made in my opinion the perfect villain, the death, being present only a little bit but enough for you to not forget him and when he does show up he'll always make you worry for Puss and remember every scene with him in it. He's exttemelly powerful and movie  acknowledges this by not letting Puss defeat him. Other two villains the bear family and Big Jack Horner are great as well and both complete opposites of each other, while one has goal that can be understood and in the end gets redeemed the other one is straight up evil for no reason other than power. Puss also gets great character growth going from someone lone wolf who thinks they're better than everyone else to someone who wants someone he can spend rest of their life with.

It's clear Sony's Into The Spiderverse was a big inspiration for the movement, camerawork and stylization. They do their best to make the fights as dynamic as possible with long shots with a camera as well animated as the characters as they swing and jump around the scene with impressive fluidity. \n\nThe movie aims for a step above the more lowbrow elements of the Shrek franchise while retaining all of its defining charm and creativity, making it one of the most impressive accomplishments of the DreamWorks team alongside Shrek 2 (another incredible sequel).",

A Grim Reaper haunts him everywhere he goes, reminding him of his possible death. Puss learns of a wish he can make on a star, which he decides he will utilize to receive more lives.

Imagine my surprise then, when I sat down to watched the feisty feline's latest cinematic venture, The Last Wish, and got a massive kick out of it. I don't have anything against the character, he just happens to be a secondary player in a film series I never liked, so he was never on my radar. But his newest film is, from what I've heard, superior to the original, and certainly more well regarded than the later Shrek flicks. Its not only got a lot of great comedy, but it manages to have its share of serious moments, and treats them with respect. When the characters are musing on the importance of family, loyalty and the perils of mortality, the film isn't constantly throwing in one liners of making obnoxious gags that take you out of the moment. As such, the characters feel real and, for lack of a better word, human. The quest is fun engaging because you know what each individual wants and why they want it, the animation, borrowing heavily from Into The Spider-Verse, uses imperfections and roughness to make things look more like classic fairy tales, and when the comedy hits, usually unexpectedly, it gets big, well-earned laughs. Unlike Spider-Verse, it's not a game changer, but the effort that's been put into its appearance, it's story and its characters, makes it more than worth your time.",

I went with a friend as a joke just hoping for something half-decent and was shocked at how much I genuinely enjoyed it. The animation was beyond incredible, specifically during fight sequences, but also just in general. Dreamworks has been hitting it out of the park recently as far as animation goes and this may be their best yet. I expected a cute but corny kids movie and got a commentary on embracing life in all of its brevity. The protagonist's story line was devastating, the villain was terrifying, I laughed out loud and cried multiple times, and walked out of the theater wanting to be a better person. The visuals, the voice acting, the story line- there's nothing wrong with this movie. I have never called a movie perfect before, but that is exactly what Puss in Boots: the Last Wish is.",

            "content": "THIS MOVIE IS THE BOMB!! \n\nFor one, this movie handles serious topics such as anxiety and death very maturely and isn't all in your face about. Best of all, it doesn't degrade or ruin the character in any way. It gives actual character development and makes it so relatable to watch!\n\nTwo, this movie has great characters with depth and deeper layers that help make them more likable and better to see. For example, Goldilocks wanted a family of her own blood but throughout the film, she realizes that she didn't need a family like that and finally learned a family is connected by love rather than DNA. Now THAT is depth right there!\n\nThree, the animation is amazing. It is so refreshing to see Dreamworks step out of their comfort zone in animation and try a new style to a point where everything is more vivid and colorful instead of the typical semi-realism we see in Dreamworks films.\n\nFour, IT HAS A GREAT VILLAIN! I know it may sound like a not-so-big deal at first but once you really think about, the villain is always the hardest character to write and organize because everyone has a different idea of a villain and how they can give audiences a fearful presence. Well, Death was a perfect example of a villain because he was bigger and felt thrill in being the bigger person and scaring Puss. Plus, his Whistle of Death is terrifying and can absolutely be frightening to both Puss and the audience. The writers also were so good in giving Death a vibe that communicated clearly to the audience that in a way, he was there and he knew that Puss was foolishly wasting his lives. \n\nFifth, it gives a fresh breath of air to character tropes that are rarely used today and actually makes them well-written! Jack Horner is a very good example of that because he is a psychopath who is beyond redeeming and chooses to be evil and blunt with his motives instead of relying on a tragic backstory to back him up. That, my friend, is how you make a good unapologetically evil villain. No relatable, no tragedy, just a fun but psychotic villain. \n\nAnd finally, the voice acting. I love how Dreamworks actually doesn't rely on famous people to boost their film but rather on them boosting it on honest work and good writing like any decent movie should do. The voice actors/actresses all did an AMAZING JOB in delivering the right presence into each character only seen through concept work, and that my friends, is difficult to achieve so a VERY BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO THEM!!!\n\nSo overall, this film is amazing, genius and very original and ground-breaking with its mix of animation but maturity and I hope Dreamworks can continue making masterpieces such as this and that these guys are currently celebrating their victory at the box offices! SO PARENTS, KIDS AND TEENS PLEASE WATCH THIS FILM! IT IS GORGEOUS AND SO WELL-WRITTEN!!! I LOVED IT SO MUCH AND VERY MUCH MUST YOU LOVE IT TOO!!! :D",

The animation is beautiful, something I hope Dreamworks carries on for more cartoony movies in the coming years, and is very colorful and atmospheric when it needs to be. The 'bad guys' all correspond with differing antagonist tropes in ways that feel seamless allowing them and their stories to not overlap in ways that feel forced, not to mention we get to see the classic Shrek2-esque spin by taking known fairytales and giving them modern twists. Extremely excited to see where Dreamworks goes from here and with El Gato con Botas.",

            "content": "This movie is an absolute masterpiece. \nLike, I aint gon lie. . . however, the movie perfectly contains sum form of social critisism. In the beginning, we can see Puss going to that ol lady and living a normal live, where the lady and the house represent current society and its function to keep its ppl safe, as it is also somehow shown in Hobbes social contract. More over, it shows that living autonomous life means to know oneself and take on burdens n stuff. So we see on that lil map that everyone has to go a diff path, since everyone has to live their own lifes the way it beneftits themselves the most. but what i think makes the movie special, is that ur not alone on youre path and that your path is not always seperate from the others but that there is lots of intersections. \nWhat i find most interesting about the paths is the goal of it. Youre said to be granted a wish, if u finish ur path. However, what i think the movie ist trying to say is that wishes/short cuts are for lil pussies. The goal of the path is not ur goal, but to find your meaning. The goal of the path is in a sense the beginning of your life. wich can also be seen in puss' path. Theres a stop where he's trapped in that lil hole an with his past lifes and the death. The Station is calles lost souls or smth. U can think that it only means \"lost lifes\" or smth. But i think what the movie is trying to say is that unless you find your own goal in life(reach the goal of the map path thing) ur lost. This is seen by the introduction of death. He said something like puss was hiding from death in more life. From running away ur basically lost, since your life has no meaning. Therefore the goal of this path is to find urselfe and your goal, what u want. Thats why that girl and her bear family had to visit a replica of their old home. \nwhat fascinates me about that scene is that the map says to look forward.But looking forward shows ur past, meaning that to be able to take steps in life u have to know where u came from and who u are. Thats sum crazy stuff ngl. \nLastly, I wanna finish of with the Death. Obviously, the coolest character in the film, since he got cool swords and a badass design. However, he is not a acting character in the film, he's just the visualisation of the death. So he doesn't kill, but jus is there to show that death is there(?) if you know what I mean? \nHe's the character that said that puss was hiding in life. What I find cool about him is not the usual talk, that u can only worth ur life when u know death. This film is greater than that. It is trying to close the binary between Life and Deaht. It is trying to show us the hierarchy that we've created, that life > death. But dont understand that both live from one another...\nSo its not that life n death are two different things, but that life inherits death and death life. In the sense that stuffs kinda mixed up: Life isnt just the absence of death. But death is the thing that makes life worth... oh wow ok it is the typical stuff, but i gotta say that the way it was portrayed was super cool. Or maybe it is different. When i watched the film, i remember that i understood it differently. Im sorry Im a lil tired. \nTo sum up, films great 10/10",

I didn't watch the original Puss in Boots and I've forgotten the plots of the Shrek sequels, but it was enjoyable and not confusing at all. You could take your kids to see this without having to rent the entire Shrek franchise for them beforehand. I like how the animation was more cartoony, stepping away from the uncannily realistic style of past Shrek movies. The voice acting was also great. Every character has a pretty distinct accent but not to the point where it feels mocking or grating, and the celebrity voice actors don't feel like they're just there to pull in a bigger audience. The theme of the movie, that we can't escape from death but shouldn't spend every moment fearing it, is something I needed when I was younger. Too many family movies are afraid to talk about death, so I enjoy the recent trend in animation where this topic is thoroughly addressed instead of avoided. Overall, a great movie made with heart, and a sequel that isn't a soulless cash grab.",

Behind the camera, directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado direct a rich story dealing with death and what it means to live.  They also use the allegory of a wish effectively, showing how all those seeking it already have what they want already if they would just look for it.

So you will have a lot to think about after watching it. And the main antagonist is one of the best antagonists in cartoons in general. His movements, look, and charisma make you scared. The sequel does not depend on the events of the first part and the series of Shrek cartoons. It tells a new story on its own, about a well-known fairy-tale character who, having spent his 8 lives, is afraid to lose his last one, running away from death itself. Visually, the cartoon is bright and fabulous. It was very unexpected that the director of the failed projects Trolls and The Croods: A New Era\" Joel Crawford, was able to make this masterpiece and wipe Disney's nose.

Didn't have any high expectations at first and wow was I in for a surprise. This film is my all-top favorite of 2022. The animation, the story, the characters. Nothing seemed shoehorned here. Even the Spanish lines --which I have little knowledge of -- didn't detract from my experience, but rather added to it. This _is_ a Spanish-based fairytale, so it makes sense. For me, the main villain in this film is the protagonist himself. Puss' own arrogance catches the attention of our supposed villain, Death disguised as the Big Bad Wolf, who gives Puss a \"boot\" of reality and makes him realize that he squandered his past 8 lives. The film does a great job of evoking fear every time Death appears on screen. The movie also tends to very effectively tug at your heartstrings here and there. One such moment is towards the end when Baby Bear thanks his sister Goldilocks for saving his life, and afterwards when they all give a heartwarming family hug. My favorite character has to be Perrito. He isn't exactly your average comic-relief as the film superbly depicts him as a supportive sidekick. He's an extremely likable character. Great, great film overall. I hope this does well in the box office because I would certainly like to see more subsequent films in this series!",

The updated animation style is awesome, the characters are all endearing and interesting (even the ones I thought would be annoying turned out to be great), the story is engaging and well written - and can I just say, both villains in this movie are incredible. A movie about heroes needs good villains, and where so many recent movies have failed, this movie succeeds big time. \n\nI was a bit nervous when I realized they were starting to follow the Marvel formula of \"chase the glowy-thing\" - but I ended up loving the concept of the Star Map and the deeper meaning it had towards revealing character motivations without every little thing having to be spelled out in an exposition dump. Simply brilliant storytelling. \n\nAnimation continues to be one of my favorite mediums for storytelling. Maybe because it always feels more thought out. Maybe because the blend of humor, heart, and action, is more seamless in animation. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish truly stands out as spectacular, and I highly recommend it.",

I think this movie did a much better job than most other childrens movies with themes about death, trust, and the idea that love is what makes life worth living. The characters were also very well-done and I enjoyed the introduction of several new characters (which were, really, new faces put to old characters) \n\nHonestly, I would love to see Dreamworks make more fairytale spin-offs.

Man was this movie a HUGE surprise and honestly a fantastic expierence. The first is the visuals, wich are obviously fantastic, with inspirations from Spider Verse and a continuation of what Bad Guys first looked like. The colors pop and Puss looks better than ever before. The story is mainly about how puss has selfishly gone trough 8 of he's 9 lifes (how clever honesly) and now puss must take good care of his last live. This makes for a great foundation for character growth, and boy does he get trough that, mainly with the help of Death (yes, the litteral characterisation of the death) who is a wolf who follows puss around, making him nervous and anxious everytime he does hes signiture wistle. With other fairytales and nursery rhymes like goldilocks and the three bears and the main villian jack horner, everyone wants to have a map that leads to one wish wich can be whatever you want. We also see the return of kitty softpaws, who also get more development than ever. With the two main characters and the addition of perrito, wich is a lovely, way to optimistic dog serving as a great friend and character, they all fight for that last wish. I wont spoil the ending, but that might geniunely be one of the best endings ever to a film. This is a great movie that talks about important topics such a trauma, trust issues and the realisation you also one day will die, and that that thought is okay to have sometimes. A movie that has so little wrong that i cannot think of a single thing that geniunely bothered me or limited the expierence. Truly a near perfect movie, and that is insane to think about, but i am really happy that it is.",

My favorite parts of the movie were the antagonists, specifically how they use three different villain types without any of them clashing. Even as an adult, the wolf antagonist gave me chills. The relatable villain had an amazing redemption arc as part of the movie's B plot. I could say plenty more about Puss' character development, but I'll leave that to the movie itself.

There are no characters who feel \"left out\", with each and every one of them having enough screen time to make you connect and like them even more.\nThe humor and desperation are also mixed perfectly. No jokes are made out of place (and, believe me, the jokes in this movie will certainly make you laugh at least once), and the rush of every character, especially Puss in Boots while facing his main fear, is transmitted to the audience flawlessly.\nDefinitely a 10/10, and one of, if not the, best animated movie DreamWorks has ever made.",

I love all of the characters and they all have some great arcs, especially Puss. Everything in this movie is amazing. Its an exhilarating thrillride that you never want to stop.

There are consistent themes of death, you can even see him in the background of some scenes. I love the art style. It's so bright and colorful, and you can even see the paint strokes. The story is heartwarming, although I believe the scenes with death are anxiety inducing and could be scary for young children. But I did love the references, like death putting coins over the eyes like the ancient Greeks. I was surprised by some scenes (like them going over each of Puss' deaths), but I really liked it. I think it's a good movie that shows how animation isn't just for children, and how adults can enjoy it as well. I hope more movies like this come out in the future.",

Joel Crawford faz um \u00f3timo trabalho ao mesclar 2D com 3D, trazendo o mesmo efeito visual de Homem Aranha: No Aranhaverso (2018). Gato de Botas tr\u00e1s o retorno triunfal de personagens que amamos como Kitty Pata Mansa (Salma Hayek), o protagonista Gato de Botas (Ant\u00f4nio Bandeiras), e nos apresenta a Perrito (Harvey Guill\u00e9n) um cachorrinho abandonado que \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel n\u00e3o se apaixonar, al\u00e9m de trazer a ess\u00eancia da DreamWorks e da Franquia Shrek novamente, brincando com contos de fadas e trazendo grandes refer\u00eancias e apresentando Cachinhos Dourados (Florence Pugh) e os Ursos, O Grilo falante e inclusive um vil\u00e3o completamente arrepiante e macabro e que transmite medo. A \u00daltima vez que a DreamWorks fez isso foi em 2014 em Como Treinar o Seu Drag\u00e3o 2 com Drago Sangue-Bravo. Gato de Botas 2: O \u00daltimo Pedido \u00e9 um presente para as fam\u00edlias, crian\u00e7as e f\u00e3s de Anima\u00e7\u00e3o em 2023. Se voc\u00ea vai assistir em 3D, compensa muito. O Roteiro e a mensagem que o filme transmite s\u00e3o excelentes, e ainda vem com um musical divertido de se assistir e com uma surpresa incr\u00edvel no final.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 I should start by talking about animation. Joel Crawford does a great job of mixing 2D with 3D, bringing the same visual effect as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018). Puss in Boots brings the triumphant return of characters we love such as Kitty Pata Mansa (Salma Hayek), the protagonist Puss in Boots (Ant\u00f4nio Bandeiras), and introduces us to Perrito (Harvey Guill\u00e9n) an abandoned puppy who is impossible not to fall in love with, besides of bringing the essence of DreamWorks and the Shrek Franchise again, playing with fairy tales and bringing great references and featuring Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Bears, The Jiminy Cricket and even a completely creepy and macabre villain who transmits fear. The last time DreamWorks did this was in 2014's How to Train Your Dragon 2 with Drago Bloodblood. Puss in Boots 2: The Last Order is a gift for families, children and Animation fans in 2023. If you're going to watch it in 3D, it pays off a lot. The script and the message that the film conveys are excellent, and it even comes with a fun musical to watch and an incredible surprise at the end.",

I also really liked the main villain, he was actually scary. I loved his whistle/theme and I loved seeing him and Puss interact. I very much enjoyed seeing Puss's character development throughout the movie and it was really interesting seeing Puss actually afraid. It was nice seeing Kitty again and Perrito is such a sweetheart! This movie had the same charm and humor as the first one. I loved all the hidden details and foreshadowing. I will definitely re-watch it again and again, this is a new favorite for sure. I really hope to see Puss and the rest of team friendship again soon!",

This is from the guy who has intentionally low standards for things to remain fair in judgment. I'm not just going to like this solely because it's a Shrek spin-off. The first film, I would do. This is a sequel for a spin-off film from 2011, and even that one was outdated because it was extending from a franchise in which most of its films were released in the 2000s. It was already outdated for the progression of culture, intolerable enough for reasons that aren't being a spin-off just by itself. Add to something outdated by itself, however, and it ends up like this, with there being no attempt at being real with anything anymore and realising that the public eye has grown less capable of critical thinking.",

I know, I know, a week ago I'd never have thought I needed to see this kids' movie but everyone's been saying \"It's incredible\", \"Best animated film I've seen all year\" and \"Best picture of 2022!\" Got it.  Then they grab me, trembling, \"If you don't see it in a theater you'll never forgive yourself!\"  So I saw it and... good Lord, it's amazing!  I knew Avatar would be visually spectacular, but this little sequel, it's so funny, so innovative in its animation (Spiderverse has launched a revolution in jazz-like style), so engaging in a story that seems lighthearted at first but really tugs at you by the end.  I can't think of a moment that wasn't perfect.  That's right.  It's perfect.  I wouldn't change a single frame.\nEvery aspect of this fairy tale contributes, from evil Jack Horner (horrid freak) to Goldie and her three-bear crime family, but ever-on-his-heels (er, paws) is a bounty hunter with red glowering eyes that... I won't spoil it for you, but the film hints at Cervante's Don Quixote and his helper Sancho, valiantly trying to preserve himself, his model of being a hero, but the world is suggesting he's a relic.  There's a metaphoric death of the dashing swordsman, but something better is born.  All the while you're laughing at every scene.  It's a triumph.\nSpecial mention goes to Perro, the little dog-dressed-as-a-cat helper (like Sancho Panza).  This side story of being yourself, winning by not opposing, victory by being incredibly naive or believing in the best at all times, it's a masterful stroke that adds to this ridiculously stunning work of perfection!  Perro's animators and story writers should get Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars.  Now get to a theater before it leaves, you'll be begging everyone to see it as well!",

Also an awesome antagonist which was the perfect representation of the fear most have.\n\nThe fact it made the kids laugh and be a little scared, without making them terrified, and made adults talk about whether they fear death means the story has resonated.\n\nWatch it.

The 2 villains are very dark, so much so that younger kids may cry during and get nightmares after watching.\n\nMaybe your kid is old enough for this material, if so please disregard.  I have one 6 and one 10.  The 10 yr old enjoyed, the 6 yr old cried and is still freaked out of the dark now (wasn't before).  \n\nPersonally, I think DreamWorks scriptwriter should punch themself for this content.\n\nWithout giving away too much, the 2 villains are unstoppable embodied death (embodied as a stalker wolf with scythes) and a psychopathic murderer who shoots people.\n\nNot sure what the creative team was thinking, but this seems unnecessarily dark and brooding.  The sociopath murderer was twisted, but the death wolf -- every time he appears, Puss (protagonist) has a panic attack.\n\nAs a fan of kids animation, there is a fine line where jokes / story may go over kids heads & is meant for adults, or times the kids get it and then have a lot of confusion trying to interpret.  This was pronounced here.  The moral of the story could have been delivered without traumatizing the youngest in the audience.\n\nI've spoken to other parents, some had to take their youngest kids crying out of the theater, many had to deal with crying scared kids & try to sit thru the movie.\n\nGo F Yourself, DreamWorks!!",

For me, the animation was most similar to what I had seen in Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, but it was executed in such a unique way by alternating between being animated on 2's for the action sequences and being animated at full fps for the dialogue and subtle interactions. The fight choreography and dynamic camera movement, while being chaotic, never left my eyes wondering where to look. \n\nIn terms of the story, it approached complex and difficult questions, like the concept of mortality and the value of your own life, or what it means to be family, and it served me the answer with ketchup and fries. It made big questions easy to understand. The topics and themes were definitely mature, but would still be understandable for younger audiences.\n\nEach of the characters were as unique and interesting as I've come to expect from Dream Works. The Last Wish really shows the difference between a \"Villain\" and an \"Antagonist\".\n\nOn a less positive note, it seems the furries have gotten attached to the wolf character... Oh, well.",

Puss struggling to deal with his anxiety and fear of death is written so well. I know I wasn't the only one to start crying during the scene where he has a panic attack.

Like I stepped through a portal and became a kid again. Puss is an amazing character, the story and supporting characters are great, and (spoilers) some of those Death scenes were actually pretty scary. They also included the mild language too, was worried they would water it down and not have that but they pulled through and had it. All in all, great movie, great experience, a certified Dreamworks classic! P.S. was that a Shrek 5 teaser at the end?? I think so and it just makes it all that much better.",

As someone that has dealt with anxiety for most of their life, a lot of scenes hit close to home for me and I have to say it was handled perfectly. This movie is full to the brim with emotional moments, high octane set pieces and fight choreography that rivals the likes of anime shows like Demon Slayer.

So, I give this movie a 10/10 absolutely must watch this movie, just a great, amazing movie. I would sell my left kidney to watch this movie again, I can only say that about one other movie.",

Its a great family movie not woke or anything no suggestible or questionable themes or characters.  Just wholesome family movie for everyone. Its like where the movies left off from Shrek and the whole puss in boots spinoff movie and tv show previously and this one is now one of the greats. I recommend you go see it. Get your popcorn drink hotdogs and nachos on! Support the movie studio and crew and your local favorite movie theaters as this is the movie to watch if your a Shrek universe lover or want a family friendly movie. You will be glad your saw this movie and be wanting another sequel like we did. I will be buying the Blueray copy!",

This movie was so damn good and it was surprising that a kid's movie was \"Kids first, Adult second\" which is something Disney is tripping on.

Middle s schoolers can probably handle it, if you dont care about the above. \n   But the audience members seeming to enjoy it the most were the 20s-30s. I heard some of them say it was their second time, and they wanted to see it on the big screen again. I went with a couple of others- 56 & 65\n     I really enjoyed the allusions to other stories and movies. (For example, Pinnochio, The theme from the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.). It was clever, animation of Puss looked like he was 3-D. I hate chihuahuas, but I learned to like what Id thought would be an annoying character.

The visuals are amazing; think Into the Spiderverse combined with Shrek, but in a good way that makes it feel grounded and realistic but still with color and style that pop out like a comic book cover, yet for the whole movie. The plot was also very engaging; I felt interested the whole time. And the biggest thing for me was how the movie felt comfortable having more mature concepts in a kids movie, which I remember when  I was 7-10 years old I loved seeing in movies, and a young relative who also watched it agreed with me on that too. It wasn't completely flawless, but truly the pinnacle of what kids movies can be.",

Like other reviewers (and I could only relate to this after seeing the show) , the red eyed wolf grim reaper could leave kids with nightmares.   \nBest over all description for this movie is 'weird'   it was a Missed opportunity.    I cant call it a bad movie..  But it is definitely weird based on the things above and I would not take my kids to see it.

The animation is great, with the action and art style taking on an aesthetic reminiscent of Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse at times. Said animation might look a bit choppy at times, but it helps to sell the over-the-top nature of some really impressive action pieces.\nAside from that, the story's pretty good and surprisingly emotional at times, and even contains some intense moments that could almost pass for light horror (no surprise that these tend to happen when the wolf character see in the trailers appears). Without giving anything away, the story also has a good message about life itself that's a good takeaway from the whole movie.  There's still plenty of funny moments, but don't go in expecting it to be a full-on comedy like the past Shrek movies and spin-offs.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time with this, and I also recommend seeing this on the big screen if you can.

The characters and the story itself had moments of joy, laughter and tears. The humor was particularly relatable and funny, again, for both adults and children.

The animation style is very similar to \"Spider Man: Into the Spiderverse\", but is also significantly different enough to mean something else to the audience.\n\nSo many creative choices that span across the whole movie, and creative choices that stick to certain scenes, are incredibly well-done and lovable. The choice to personify death is one of my favorite villains of all-time; and he is so well done it legitimately brings me to tears. The scene where Puss in Boots is fleeing from the Cave of Lost Souls and is comforted by Perrito, the choice to legitimately make a heart-wrenching and emotion-packed scene is so awesome when I know that adding a tension-relieving joke would have been so easy. \n\nBut it's not all serious, after-all it is a kid's movie. But to call it a kid's movie is a strawman- it is so, so much more. The jokes are well-done and the references to pop culture (\"Not the bees!\") are both cringey and lovable; just how I like them. The wish plotline is a common trope, but is so well done in this movie through the incredible relationships between characters. Goldi and the Bears are a group that want the wish to have a family, but already have one. Kitty Soft-Paws wants the wish to trust someone, but through the journey she gains that naturally. Puss in Boots wants the wish to get more lives, and to make his glory-days last forever, but learns that this isn't what he truly wants. Jack Horner is a greedy doofus and genuinely has some great jokes, as well as serving alongside Death as a sort of \"Time-Keeper\". \n\nIncredible movie. The 10/10 rating is overdone but I legitimately think this movie was pulled off nigh-perfect, and is an incredible addition to the animated movies world.",

The message of having one life, and appreciating it is great and the movie doesnt beat you with it. The plotline with Kitty having trust issues is actually very well done, many movies, like for example \"raya and the last dragon\" these days try to feed it to you through a tube while screaming at your face \"DO YOU GET THE MESSAGE?\". Death as a character is one of, if not the best and most scary villians from dreamworks movies. In the first scene with him i had litteral chills when they showed Puss bleeding, i was not expecting them to show something like this in a kids movie,The idea that litteral death is trying to kill you, is terrifying. I expected to hate the supporting dog character, but i didnt. Its nice to see a such a positive character interacting with all those sad and bitter (for the most part) characters. His backstory was so tragic, it almost made me cry T_T.  Easily one of the best movies by Dreamworks. 12/10 would watch again",

        {
            "content": "I'll get this out of the way first. This movie is fantastic. Plain and simple. It's great. It's creative, it's funny, it's touching, it's scary, it's mature, it's intelligent, it's entertaining for both kids AND adults, it's... A goddamn Puss in Boots The Last Wish. I think we can all agree that this is the last title anyone here can associate with top notch quality. I mean it's a sequel to a spin-off movie from over 10 years ago. A rather mediocre one at that. And yet this movie goes far and beyond ANY expectations and makes itself into probably THE best animated movie of 2022. But then again. This is coming from a studio that made Kung Fu Panda series be known as one of the finest animation series as well.\n\nBut let's get to the details. First being the animation. It's gorgeous. It's amazing how well this movie looks with it's Spiderverse like animation and further proves how chasing after realizm in animated movies is at this point a fool's errand that kind of misses the point of animated movies. But it's not just a rip-off Spiderverse in looks. Oh no. When that movie looked like a comic book that came to life, this one feels like a Illustrated Fairy Tale book. The paint brush aesthetic looks great, it's colorful and feels alive. It's animated in a fantastic way and I think it's best described in saying that the fight with the Giant from the trailers is NOT the best part of this movie. Oh no. It only gets better from there. 10/10 on visuals.\n\nNow to the characters. I love pretty much all of them. Puss in Boots of course takes center stage here and his character is at it's best here in terms of depth and humor. He is cocky bastard at first, but as he loses his next to last life he quickly gets humbled and reminded of his now very apparent mortality and his character goes through great amount of growth. It's very nice to see his character evolve like it does in this movie. Another stand out I say is the Wolf who I can already tell will give several children nightmares (and that's good, you know a good fairy tale from the amount of scarred children it leaves in it's wake). People that made this DO NOT hold back with how scary they make this character. He is by far the best thing in the movie from his fights, the change in mood whenever he appears and the music that accompanies him. He is definitely one of the best villains I saw in an animated movie (but I could argue if it's okay to call him one, but that would mean getting into spoilers). Other characters such as Kitty Softpaws, Goldielocks, Three Bears, Jack Horner and Perrito are all VERY fun as well. Goldie and her family are a very sweet family that go through their own journey in this and could be said they are deutragonists of this movie, I really enjoyed them, their chemistry and their sweet development. Jack Horner though... I say this. He is by far the funniest part in this movie. He is a bastard, plain and simple and he is hilarious because of it and a certain character that is alongside him for a good chunk of the movie. As for Kitty, it's very nice to see her back and her story tied with Puss is very interesting and I like how they do not linger too long on her drama with Puss and resolve it in a more real way that doesn't derail the movie in any way. And then there is Perrito who many probably thought was going to be an annoyance, but he is by far the Heart of this movie and he is involved in probably the most touching scene in the movie. You will know when you see it. All in all characters another 10. It's incredible how there are so many of them and all of them are fun and likeable in their own way.\n\nThe story itself is very simple. It's a race to get the Last Wish from a fallen star. It's as Fairy Tale-ish as you can get. But the way it's executed, the way each character changes (well most of them at least) on this journey and how imaginative and creative the setups and environments are make it feel fresh and it really leaves an impact on you. Don't be fooled by the marketing. This movie deals with VERY heavy subjects such as death, mortality and appreciating one's life and acceptance of Death. It's a heavy movie in terms of themes, but it's so great to see that with it, it still is a very entertaining movie. With many clever jokes, great pacing, fantastic music (oh my God the music is GREAT in it as well. Heitor Pereira did a A+ job here) and colorful world and characters. It is a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and that is something that is so good to see today. And this movie VERY well utilizes it's PG rating. Kids NEED Parental guidance in this movie, it is not a movie you put on to shut them up. You put it on because you want to show them something great, something they can have fun with, be scared of and learn from. And I think a lot of adults can sympathize with struggles characters face in this movie and laugh at the more adult jokes as well. Overall from story standpoint it's also 10/10. It's not a new story or message, but it is told in a way that makes it FEEL new and fresh and it tackles it in a mature way.\n\nAs for flaws... Ehhhh... Hard for me to find really. To me it's as perfect as animated flick can get. Again PUSS IN BOOTS THE LAST WISH. God is this a weird thing to say. Maybe there are some pacing issues with Goldie's story and her family conflict being resolved quickly during climax and one character is pretty damn 1-dimensional, but I would argue it's to add to the comedy and charm of said character since that one is not meant to be seen as anything more serious. It is not one the same level of greatness as Prince of Egypt obviously, but as far as Shrek movies go or most Dreamworks movies go... or hell, most animated movies go overall it's pretty damn close to the top to me. In Shrek franchise it's on the same level as Shrek 2 to me and it's a high, HIGH praise.\n\nI have to say. I always preferred Dreamworks over Pixar. Yes, they do have FAR lower lows than the animation juggernaut, but to me they had higher highs with movies such as Prince of Egypt or Kung Fu Panda movies (and the fact that I can say Kung fu Panda series is one of the best pieces of animation is hilarious) and I found their good movies to be far more rewatchable than Pixar ones. But since then they kind of went down with quality sadly, but recently with The Bad Guys and now this movie I think it's safe to say that they are officially back and maybe better than ever. This movie I think proves how great movies from Dreamworks can be today and I think if they keep on going in this direction we may get more VERY special movies from this studio. And I wish them the best of luck on this road and for this movie to become greater and greater success, maybe even winning an Academy Award (as meaningless as that became as of late).\n\nWhat can I say anymore it's about 9.5 to 10/10 to me. I love it. And I think many people will love it as well. Probably not to the same degree as me, but I think this will make your day and the new year that much better. It's worth your money, it's worth your time, it's worth your attention and by all means it's worth watching more than once.",

Moving, sad, happy, frightening, overwhelming, and calming each in their own scene. So many emotions throughout one story, and none of them felt forced or out of place.\n\n[SPOILER WARNING]\nSome specifics I especially liked:\n- Death. The metaphor of death and the disliking of multiple cat lives embodied as a fearsome wolf on the hunt is one of the best ideas this movie could've used. The character itself, when looked back on, is blatantly obvious, but the viewer might not even know what they are facing until it's clearly told. Their ambition and hunt-thrill build a compelling obstacle character who isn't straight up evil. Their motif isn't inherently to kill Puss, but to punish someone who hasn't valued their life while they were thrown so many chances to do so. I respect that.\n- Perrito. I don't even know where to start. Our pup is so blatantly traumatized they don't even notice it. The support they provide to anyone who crosses their path is amazing, especially since they've had noone who wanted them up until the movie's story. They also represent a part of quite a lot of people's life, where they rely on therapy animals to go about their days and be able to overcome anxiety attacks, get general emotional support, or maybe even thoroughly aided help, which a companion can provide. The scene where Puss had a meltdown and Perrito laid on them felt real in atmosphere, just as in accuracy, as anxiety aid companions often apply pressure to help the body calm down. I love what Perrito stands for.\n- The animation. It is dynamic, it isn't a constant, and that's what makes it so compelling and satisfying to look at. The framerate constantly changes, the simplified special effects give an entire different tone to a scene, and the ever changing flashing colors make for an amazing environment which doesn't stop moving when a good fight comes up. The camera work is so well done, it's always clear to see what the power of the current shot is. As an animation nerd myself I bow to this cinematic masterpiece.\n\nI've talked enough, all in all I can only recommend this movie.\n\nGet your tissues ready because you'll be in for an emotional rollercoaster!",

            "content": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" was one of the biggest surprises of 2022. This was not a movie that anyone was asking for, yet it was incredibly charming and fun. The film merges two animation styles, which are both gorgeous and cutting edge. There are moments of traditional DreamWorks animation and others that are similar to \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\".\n\nThe characters introduced in this film are reminiscent of those in the first two \"Shrek\" movies. Each character is carefully thought out, and evokes an emotional response, whether that be hope, fascination, or fear. From the confused Goldilocks to the adorable Perrito to the fearsome Lobo, everyone brings something new to the table.\n\nThere is honestly not a lot to criticize about \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\". The film hit darker notes than previous \"Shrek\" films and there were moments in the theater when kids shrieked. Some of the scenes are a little drawn out, but the story itself is strong.\n\nFor those with small children, be aware that there is a strong use of \"hell\" and some cleverly censored words throughout the movie. Otherwise, the film is perfectly appropriate (more than some other \"Shrek\" movies) for kids.\n\n\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is the best animated film of 2022 and the best \"Shrek\" film since \"Shrek 2\" (not that the competition is very stiff). The animation is stunning, the voice-acting crisp, and the story is interesting for both children and adults. Even if you haven't seen the first \"Puss in Boots\", go and see this movie. You will not be disappointed.\n\nAlso, the new DreamWorks opening is excellent.\n\nBest Character: Perrito\nBest Scene: Reading the map\nBest Quote: \"Maybe one life is enough\" - Perrito",

From character designs to the environment. \nAs for the plot, it was heartfelt and charming. The feel of the movie felt grounded and not too over the top with the humour. Definitely something people of all ages would enjoy.\nThe Villans were all entertaining to watch, one of them clearly stands out from the rest. (don't want to spoil it)\nI generally recommend this movie for any fan of animation or anyone wanting a sweet distraction for an hour and 40 minutes.\nGood movie overall.",

This movie is on par with Shrek 2. I loved the antagonists and all the side characters like the dog perrito and Kitty Softpaws. I loved the main antagonists being Death and Jack Horner. Allthough i didnt know who the character \"Jack Horner\" was he was a very funny characters with his design and the way he acted with no regard for his goons. I also loved the way they described \"Death\" in this movie. They describe them as a scary character that has the motive of \"Death will always find you\" and \"wherever you run i will always find you\". This movie also has alot of character development, for example the protagonist; Puss In Boots is shown at first as an egoistic self centered person who sees himself like a living legend who doesnt fear death. But later when he dies and is down to his last life he encounters actuall death and is scared for his life running away, and as described in the movie, always comes back for him.

Most movies can't develop a single character properly in an entire 2h movie. This movie manages to develop and make you interested in 3 villains and 3 main characters all while advancing the film. I've never been a fan of children movies because of how simple their messages are. However, this movie is a one in a million.  Seriously great stuff, enjoyable for all the family ( lots of more mature jokes that land very well). It is as good as Shrek 2 ( and that is saying a lot!!!!).",

BUT OH MY GOD I LOVED THE WOLF. LITERALLY one of my favorite anganonists/villains of all time. he had such a relaxed and cold personality no fear just confidence in what he could do. he wanted to teach puss in boots to value your life and do be grateful. and once he understood he backed away, then pus and him agreeded that they would meet again because is death \"straight up\". the wolfs distant whistle such a simple tune is like death slowly creeping up. i loved jack horner too, he had such an amazing and funny design and personality. perito (the dog) was so cute too i loved pusses new start with kitty soft paws. overall such an amazing movie and it made me cry honestly, very funny as well.",

Even the payoffs to goofy plot devices like Perrito learning dough eyes was well used. The antagonists and villains were so spot on. And the bounty hunter arch was amazing. The first few scenes were so fantastically done that I didn't think it would keep it up through a few sections, but it just kept being amazing. \nIt really feels like the producers were told to just make a good movie, and that's what they were done. I don't feel the hand of the studio in this at all, just an amazingly well done animated film. And an absolute see in the theaters experience, as well.\nThe low frame rate, Spiderverse style animation moments made me feel like they were going to try to pointlessly capitalize on that style, but they really utilized it to elevate the action sections, even using the style to contrast standard animation motion to push parts of the narrative and character development.

So when I heard there was going to be a sequel I hoped and hoped it would live up to the expectations of my childhood. WELL IT DID. the animation is beautiful and full of life. It's colorful and doesn't feel synthetic or corporate like the latest disney movie animation has been. The jokes are actually funny. There are definitely a few jokes only adults would understand and they used very very mild curse words but it works! The dialogue fits the movie in my opinion and I loved how they also used a lot more spainish in this movie! They also made sure there wasnt english subtitles so those jokes are only for the spainish speakers in there hehe (me included lol). The characters were also really good, none of them annoyed me which is suprizing because usually in cartoon movies there is some kind of side kick or something that just gets on my nerves but there wasnt any in this movie! The character design is one of my favorite aspects of the movie. And the jabs at Disney were really funny aswell. The story also really hit home and made me tear up a bit since I deal with some of the things that were talked about in the movie (spoiler?: mostly puss's anxiety of death and living up to his \"legend\" also the therapy dog reminded me of my cat who is kind of like my therapy animal lol). Anyways the story was 10/10, everything was 10/10 and I would definitely watch it over and over again. And I hope DreamWorks continues making great sequels and movies like this!!!",

            "content": "Where do I even begin. I walked into the theater expecting a mildly interesting action adventure movie about a talking cat wearing boots and I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is absolutely amazing, and I don't say that lightly. For starters, the writing for the characters was simply outstanding. When I saw that there was many characters, I was worried that some of the characters would be tossed to the side a little too easily and that others would receive too much spotlight but no! Each character had depth and added something interesting to the movie. I didn't dislike a single character and not once did I feel like any character under/overstayed their welcome. I also enjoyed the humor. Many movies targeted towards children nowadays just use crude, unfunny humor to try to appeal kids but this movie is actually funny. The jokes don't feel forced and I found myself audibly laughing at many gags. The animation left me speechless. It was incredible. Not a second of screen time was wasted and every frame was vibrant and full of life. Some scenes, you could see every hair on Puss's face and on others, unshed tears glistening in his eyes. The style was definitely inspired by Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse but didn't feel like a copy. The film takes that comic book style and warps it into its very own unique version. The paintbrush aesthetic adds so much color and depth to each scene, giving the viewers some amazing scenery. The fight scenes were action packed and well choreographed. During many of them, especially during Puss's final fight with Death, I could feel my heart pounding in anticipation. Will he win, will he loose? The fights keep you entertained and on your toes, it's outrageously good. While the plot felt a little simple, it feels intentional so that the movie can focus more on the compelling characters and settings. The forest where most of the movie takes place is such an interesting concept, the landscape changing depending on who was holding the map led to some great animation and ideas. The movie took a huge risk with three main antagonists and it thankfully, pulls it off well! I adored Goldilocks relationship with the three bears and her emotional inner turmoil was a great addition to the story. I also enjoyed John Mulaney's role as Jack Horner and while he did feel like the weakest villain, he makes up for it by being incredibly funny. I don't even know how to describe the third antagonist, the wolf, who was the embodiment of death. The wolf was genuinely scary. His bright red eyes standing out against the darker tones of the scenes he was in was so visually pleasing. Watching death himself stalk Puss the entire movie was chilling and compelling. From the very moment he appeared on screen, I could tell he was going to be one of the best parts of the movie. Watching Puss run away from the fight and have a full blown panic attack in the woods truly showed the audience just how much of a threat the wolf was. The movie didn't treat the wolf like a joke and didn't present him lightly. He is death. I don't mean that metaphorically, or rhetorically, or poetically, or theoretically, or any other fancy way. He is death. This review is crazy long and I am starting to ramble so I will end this with an overall rating. \n\nHumor- 9.5/10\nCharacters- 9.5/10\nPlot- 8/10\nAnimation- 10/10\nOverall- 9.5/10\n\nI strongly recommend watching this movie. It is 100% worth the watch. It is a great movie to let loose and forget about boring day to day life too. Let yourself be immersed in the colorful, compelling world with fun meaningful characters, great music, funny jokes, and amazing animation.",

I think it's visually beautiful much of the time.\n\nMost of all I love the bold, Thoreau-ean message, beautifully manifested into a literal fight sequence at the end of the film: that we must learn to cherish, defend, and embrace-- with passion and without fear-- the one short and precious life we have, and stop passively wasting our time away, wishing for an easy fix.",

And I am sitting there blown away by the scenes and wondering if anybody else is getting it too? \nThe character death is a manifestation of Puss's fear and anxiety collected over his past lives. In this journey, his old identity went through a whole breakthrough and he had to face his fear which he has avoided for all his lives. It was pretty summed like a Dark of night the soul? Then there was the character Perrito which really shines through the story, whom was the exact epitome of innocence, joy and purity? Even after going through such a tremendous sorrows, he was still vastly unaffected and is able to keep an attitude of unwavering positivity and lightheartedness? That, truly, is a character of enlightened nature. I feel that his had so much to teach all of us, that despite whatever that happens to us, it was perception that created our reality.",

I never would have expected a Puss in Boots sequel of all things to be about panic and anxiety and existential dread. Every character is given just enough development for the purpose they serve without feeling like they are overdeveloping someone, or ignoring someone who needed more depth for the part they play. This movie was full of characters, and the fact that they managed to somehow neatly place them all into the story baffles me as an aspiring writer. The wolf is obviously incredible and horrifying. His presence mixed with Puss's fear, amazingly brought to life by the character animation, puts you right into the scene with them. Even Perrito is a fantastic addition to the cast. Making him the only character who frequently curses is a hilarious subversion. I also think that Jack Horner is really funny. I haven't seen him talked about as much but I find his irredeemably cruel personality really great, especially since it fits the whole -death- theme of the movie.

The sequel to that mediocre movie about the funny little cat from Shrek that came out over a decade ago?\" My entire family laughed at me when I told them I was going to see Puss in Boots 2 in the theater. But please trust me when I say that this movie is a masterpiece for kids and adults equally. Nothing I say can prepare you for how unironically and extraordinarily good this film is. I cannot believe it hasn't even grossed a tenth of what Avatar: The Way of Water has worldwide. We need to support this movie so that Dreamworks understands that we see it and that we want more like it.\n\nOn the surface, it may seem like a quaint little movie about Puss and the frankly generic hero's struggle with overcoming an inflated ego, but it's so much more than that. Without giving away too much, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish dives headfirst into very emotionally mature topics in a way that I seldom see in movies- animated or otherwise. Throughout the film, Puss grapples with the reality of mortality, and it's genuinely terrifying and impactful.\n\nI feel like this movie really showed off how animation is a medium that deserves respect. There are some aspects of this movie that just wouldn't work in a live-action film, and I adore that. The exaggerated anatomy during fight scenes, a certain red-eyed wolf villain, and the incredible character acting are all things that I can't imagine being executed as flawlessly as they did in the limitless medium of animation. The painterly brush strokes in the environment and characters really fit the fairytale genre. I was just blown away by the beauty packed in every single frame.\n\nThe fact that the pacing was so flawless despite there being 3 main villains and 3 main protagonists to give appropriate amounts of screentime was absolutely insane. At no point did it feel like we spent too long or too little on one character, and everyone's motives and actions felt in-character, justified, and well thought out. To me, this is what cinema is. This is what it's all about. Not a wasted shot, not a wasted line, not a wasted second. Perfect intention in every moment. Every second is dense with beautiful visuals and rich storytelling.",

Reviving an 11-year dead franchise with a mediocre spin-off franchise's sequel film? That's nearly unheard of. And somehow, they made it work.\nThe Last Wish is the greatest representation of anxiety and PTSD I have ever encountered, and that's coming from someone with an anxiety disorder. Puss's anxiety attack was so real. His fear blinded him, and the comfort of those he was near to helped him through such a traumatic experience.\nAgain, the revival of the Shrek universe wasn't something I was looking forward to, but DreamWorks brought their A-game. The vibrant animation style, enticing soundtrack, well-written characters, and beautiful story is amazing.\n9.5/10. Watched twice and tempted to go for a third. Expect me on opening night for Shrek 5.",

People need to go see it in theaters so that it succeeds in the box office. DreamWorks NEEDS to make more films like this one!\n\nSpoilers below!\n\nFirst off, the animation is stunning. It's stylized, similar to Spiderverse but with it's own flair. It has a very pastel like feel to it which greatly compliments the fairy tale theme.\nThe action is top notch! They purposely lower the frame rate during high action scenes. It helps to exaggerate the look of fast motion, and let's you feel the weight of blow. The choreography is great! The very first fight scene is very reminiscent of Levi fighting the titan on the rooftops in Attack On Titan, and the action only gets better from there.\nThis movie has not a single bad character somehow! Even the dog, who you'd think would be annoying, ended up being genuinely heartwarming and has funny moments. Never during the film was I disappointed to cut away to a different character because they were all good and all had an appropriate amount of screen time. The character arcs were compelling, the villains were incredible- I'll get back to the villains- not a single second of this film was spent on a character that brought down the experience.\nThis film has a lot of villains. You would think that with that many villains to juggle, the film would miss the mark, but no. It all balances out quite nicely! And they're all distinctly different from each other! Jack Horner is a hilariously irredeemable crime boss, Goldilocks and the three bears have a genuinely heartwarming message, and the wolf is by far the best animated villain I have ever seen! Maybe even the best villain period! If you have small children, this might not be a good film for them because the wolf is scary. And I don't mean that metaphorically, poetically, rhetorically, theoretically or any of that. I mean he is straight up scary.\nThis movie's themes about death and making the best of the time you have left on this Earth is handled really, really well and maturely. It has Puss having to come to grips that one day, he will die. Now that he's on his last life (since cats have nine lives), he has the fear death in him. Seeing him grow and realize that death comes for us all, and accepting that feels like a major and well deserved accomplishment.\nWhile I absolutely adore this film, there are a couple cautionary warnings that I feel I have to express about this movie. While it is advertised for kids, it has a lot of darker themes, suggested swearing, morbid humor, and an intense villain that parents may not want to expose their younger children to. That said, if you think you're child is old or mature enough to handle some somewhat more intense themes and action, then this is a movie that both the parents and the kids will enjoy.\n10/10 stars, go watch this movie!",

It is also absolutely hilarious! \n\nEvery character is extremely well written for the roles they play in the film and the main antagonist is a new top tier Dreamworks villain. The stylization of the art and animation is fantastic as well! The best movie from the Shrek Universe since Shrek 2 in my opinion. Overall a great movie!",

I also wanted to go second time to support dreamworks which is extremely underrated and my favourite animation studio. I think It's the best animated movie since like Idk more than 10 years. Definitely recomend watching I'm in love with this movie currently and I don't think 5 start is enough beacouse It's a 11/10 movie. BUT there is a problem with this movie. It's too short I mean It was perfect for what it is but If it was like 2h It would be my favourite animated movie ever and the top 3 are practically the same at ranking. so If it was longer It would be a perfect movie",

Especially the scene where Puss has a panic attack due to Death chasing after him and Perrito comforting him, I don't know why but I felt like I was gonna cry because it was such raw and realistic representation of anxiety disorders and panic attacks, as a person who suffers from GAD. Every character was so interesting and I never felt like their presence onscreen was a waste of time. This is one of the best modern movies coming from Dreamworks, and should I say one of the best animated films that came out this year, probably even better than GDT's Pinnochio (which I'm also a big fan of).

It tells a story of an arrogant, selfish adventurer, whose ego and carelessness led to him burning through 8 of his 9 lives, then going on a quest to get them back, and along the way, learns that he doesn't have to be the Legend, always alone, always being self-centered and egotistical. Puss goes on a journey to the Wishing Star, which will grant one wish to whoever gets to it first. He is joined by Perrito, a dog who, despite being treated like crap all of his life, is very upbeat and happy, and just a little too trusting for his own good, and he meets back up with Kitty Softpaws, his old flame, with some understandable trust issues. But they are not alone in the search for the Wishing Star, because there are 3 main baddies after our feline hero. First is Little Jack Horner, or rather Big Jack Horner, a giant psychopath bent on getting all the magic in the world. Next is Goldielocks and the Three Bears Crime Family, a smash-and-grab operation and a real family, as they took Goldie in and made her a part of their family. And finally, no fairy tale would be complete without Wolf, who may be more than just a bounty hunter. The movie is good, it's really good, it's really incredibly really good. The character development has really advanced in this movie, the story has some serious messages while also having lighthearted moments. They even swear in the movie(Don't worry, the really bad ones are bleeped out{Yes, the bleep sound effect is in the movie!) After 11 years, the Legend has returned. He's back, and better than ever. The character arcs are beautiful, with Puss, Kitty, and Perrito all going through noticeable changes throughout the entire movie. And there is a sub-plot with Goldie and the Bears, and Kitty too, involving themes of family and trust respectively. The movie doesn't dumb down the themes, not laying them out like a Thanksgiving banquet. It shows the themes, instead of telling them. Big Jack Horner was a genuinely funny villain, and even though he didn't have his own character arc, he was no less of a villain than the others. Over, the movie is exceptionally-great, with amazing animation, fun and complex, the stories are very compelling, with themes that are shown instead of told, like fear of death, appreciating your life, what family really means.",

This movie is all I have thought about the past day after seeing it and just cause of that I might go see it again due to it being so amazing.

While \"Puss in Boots:  The Last Wish\" does have its problems, it is still a very well made and entertaining movie.  Antonio Banderas is perfect as the voice of the title character.  Salma Hayek is terrific also as the voice of Kitty Softpaws.  The supporting characters are clever and well done.  The character of Perrito (voiced by Harvey Guillen.) is also a welcome addition to the long list of comic sidekicks we see in these types of movies.  One other highlight is the character of Death (Voiced by Wagner Moura.).  The writers on this movie handeled the character very well.  The resolution with the character was quite good.  My only criticism of the movie is its rather formulaic storyline.  In the beginning of the movie, Puss only thinks of himself and could not care less about anybody else.  However in time he comes to realize his selfishness is wrong and he needs to change his attitudes towards others.  Nothing we have not seen before.  However this minor flaw is made up for by a well done climactic fight sequence.  It has just the right amount of thrills and does not become too drawn out or overblown.  Over two decades after \"Shrek\" Dreamworks is still able to keep the franchise going with some good entertainment.  If you are a Shrek fan as I am I think you would like \"Puss in Boots:  The Last Wish\".",

Puss in Boots 2 is marvelous in terms of animation, anyone with eyes and a bit of creativity could've seen that; however, the story and characters really sink in just how much love and effort was put into this film. Puss is the perfect depiction of growing out of who you once were into something better, coming to terms with the fact that you need to cherish the one life you have with the ones you love. The pacing is just right with only one moment in the beginning feeling just a tad bit drawn out. Overall we had a lot of fun watching this film and finding our own ways to connect with the different characters in the film.

            "content": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the \"Shrek\" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. \"The Last Wish\" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original \"Puss in Boots.\" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, \"The Last Wish\" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you.",

Voice work is a knock-out, and the animation style feels like a classic fairy tale book coming to life for most of the duration, which is a nice, magical touch.

The scale of scariness and dark characters tipped over in my opinion for younger viewers and unfortunately, the good moral may be lost in the sea of scariness.  One little girl who is 5 was telling me how scared she was of the wolf and didnt want to see the movie ever again and of blood on the cat.  Its all she could recount from the story line and I guarantee it is a one and done viewing for her - no interest in seeing, renting it or wanting any merchandise from it.  Im glad my kids are grown now.  But, when they were younger, the movies we took them to were ones that inspired them and they found characters they wanted to be like and theyd watch the movie- no joke- 20 times or more!  I wish for those kind of characters again for this next generation of you g kids - not ones that keep them up all night with the lights on",

This movie traumatised all the kids in the cinema when Puss died, the way he died was very violent because he got shanked up by   wolf. The movie tickets were not worth the 3.65$ that I payed for, I could of put that money together to by my wife diapers because she is getting old. I hope dreamworld fixes this movie and this is a warning for everyone.\n\nSincerely \nJohn Pentavious Mars",

            "content": "\"This is a fairytale.\"\n\nThe narrator states, matter-of-factly, in the beginning of the film. And of course you'd think a talking cat in boots fighting giant tree-stone monster while holding a concert is a fairytale, right? \n\nBecause if you think so you're wrong. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a surprisingly deep and relatable story about the meaning of death and of life. \n\nWith a mix-and-mashed version of a few well-known fairytales, the writer showed audiences of all ages some otherwise done-to-death morals, that life is to be cherished, that the real wish is the friends we made along the way, to stop and smell the rose, etc. etc. They are, of course, not the main parts of the story, but they have set a heartwarming ambience to the narrative, and did so successfully, making it insightful even to an adult.\n\nThe central piece to the story, then, is Death's overarching pursuit for Puss in Boots. Character, animation, and sound designers reached for the best of the best in making the appearance of Death as horrifying as possible, because to Puss in Boots and possibly most of us, he is. Although he was personified in the film, the way different visual elements worked together still made it easy to interpret the story in a figurative way and read its moral that life is to be cherished.\n\nThe film's pace seems somehow rushed, but I don't see it being a bad thing. Fast-paced storytelling does not mean an incoherent narrative, and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish did a nice job in picking up any loose ends before the resolution. If anything, I'd prefer its quick pace of narration over a Hollywood action-adventure-scifi-romcom that has a thousand character arcs and spans over three hours.\n\nAll in all, take those morals or not, you're still going to enjoy the occasional jokes, top-tiered graphics design, interlinked story arcs, and finally that part of your childhood, revisited. \n\n9/10",

He had left his feline cat at the altar and loved being the centre of attraction when he did all his heroic deeds. \n\nThere were plenty of villains all taken from the nursery rhymes and there was a good v evil plot and in the end only one real nasty - the others changed.

            "content": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is a fun adventure in the \"Shrek\" universe! I gotta admit I have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the \"Shrek\" films as much as many do\u2026 so I went into this with mild expectations. And honestly, I had a good time; it was cute! Do I think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? No. But it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! The voice cast was awesome, especially John Mulaney and Florence Pugh as the villains, Jack Horner and Goldilocks respectively. And of course Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots is iconic as ever!\n\nThe animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. I love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3D CGI realism. You gotta respect \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! I loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! I would love to see the \"Shrek\" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. This movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like I was watching a story in a fairy tale world.\n\nNow, of course I have to admit I didn't love this movie. Something about it felt off to me, I couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. Sure, it was fun, it was cute, and I enjoyed myself while watching, but I never felt like I truly connected with the film. The opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and I wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. I get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. I don't really feel that here \u2014 they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline \u2014 but it never actually worked in my eyes. Everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant I wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why I wouldn't enjoy it as much. I have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! I'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as I was told it would be.\n\nI think the movie tried to do a bit of what Pixar is known for, the whole \"trying to be deep\" thing. The movie involves Puss in Boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. Instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. And the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of \"maybe I don't need the thing I wanted all long and it's the friends I made along the way that count\" seem all the more predictable. Even Puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. Although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. The chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in \"Shrek\". Still the adventure was quite fun, I just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like Pixar's \"Up\", \"Finding Nemo\" or even DreamWorks' \"How to Train Your Dragon\". \n\nPerhaps I am being too harsh, I feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. I really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. The animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man I loved the little nods to the \"Shrek\" movies even if I was never a huge fan of those. If nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another \"Shrek\" film. I do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!",

            "content": "After seeing the overwhelmingly positive response to this movie, and all the great critics reviews, all I can say is that I must have seen a completely different movie. This was not only not amazing, it was actually pretty bad. I'm not even mad that it was bad, because Dreamworks hasn't been making good movies for about a decade now (sadly), so I wouldn't have bothered to see the movie except for the great reviews. And it is exactly as dumb as I originally thought it would be. If you think Puss in Boots 2 is a really great movie, trust me the bar is so much higher. Go watch the Dreamworks back catalog pre-2011, or Pixar pre-2010. If you want to watch a great animated movie made more recently, check out Spiderman Into the Spiderverse or The LEGO Movie. Also, GDT's Pinoccio was actually pretty solid. I don't want to demean anyone's tastes, just know that if you love animation and loved this movie, there is so much more great things to see so don't set your bar here. As for Dreamworks, I gotta say I'm so sad to see where you've ended up. I really miss the quality of movies you used to make. Prince of Egypt, Sinbad, El Dorado, Spirit, Kung Fu Panda 1&2, How to Train Your Dragon, Megamind, and even Shrek (I guess) these movies will all be remember long after your mediocre cash grabs such as Puss in Boots 2 are long forgotten.",

Kitty Softpaws and Puss's dynamic is hilarious yet beautiful, and their arc throughout the movie is incredible. I'm not even going to try to describe how amazed I was at Puss's development throughout the film, how he goes from an adventure-driven, self-obsessed and reckless swashbuckler to a more humble and introspective (but still swashbuckling!) cat, having learned from his experiences throughout all of his nine lives and through his encounters with death - literally. \nI loved this movie so, so much and I could probably talk about it all day, but I won't keep you.

It wasn't awful, I just didn't have the energy that I wanted. Turns out, The Last Wish is everything that I wanted from the first Puss in Boots!\nThe animation is quick yet detailed, a lot of the comedy is really dark and really funny, the action sequences are incredibly fast and creative, and the movie has a lot of great drama and heart.\nThe movie does have flaws though. Because everything feels so fast, the pacing can often times feel really rushed, and some of the comedy can come off as a little annoying.\nBut still, this movie was better than it had any right to be! This is almost everything that I wanted from a Puss in Boots movie and, although it's no game changer, it is satisfyingly fun!",

The story is solid but I think more than anything I liked the emotions the film genuinely is able to earn with its characters and messages.

I'm not kidding.\nSure, it has some jokes aimed at kids (being a kids movie and all) but the movie quickly turns around to show you either the most beautiful and dynamic animation you've seen since Spiderverse, or the most bone chilling and thrilling fight scenes.\nAlso the story is so heartwarming and honest with it's themes that you'll shed a tear at least once.\nAnd the music is excellent, just like the first movie, making use of it's Spanish influence to bring you some great bops.\nJust watch it, it's the holidays and you'll have a great time.",

The animation is obviously inspired by Spiderverse, and it gives the film a sense of kinetic energy and striking spectacle that I was really hoping to see more of from the studio after the brilliant presentation of Bad Guys. The emotional beats accomplish their goals pretty well, especially when it comes to a certain family, but a little more depth to the main antagonist would have been appreciated to make the final confrontation feel a touch more meaningful.

New fun characters, wonderful animation, and a unique story make this film worthy of the titular legend feline. \n\nI really appreciate the characters, especially two outstanding villain characters (Arguably, some of the best to come from the studio ever), no spoilers. There was no character I didn't like, which is a rarity. It was also very funny at times, I even had to hold back laughter in the theater. \n\nThe art style, especially the backgrounds, reminds me of the original way the settings were done by hand painting on animated films such as Disney's Bambi (1942). This film brings back such artistic styles which founded animation; Styles that have been replaced and critically forgotten over the last few decades. It is a similar animation style to that in Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse (2018), yet it was more painting-like and less comic book-like. It truly did make me feel as if I was inside a fairytale world.\n\nAddressing some fellow audience critiques, one villain in particular definitely sent chills down my spine when he appeared, enough so that any child might want to advert eyes for a second or two. This is a true villain character. It is important to recognize that even if a villain may be scary, that is the point. As far as that kind of villain being in a movie with children in mind, if you think about it over the years films have lacked such despicable characters, especially looking back at some earlier animation films from big studios including Disney. Therefore, this really shouldn't be a factor in limiting any child to see this film under your advisement (It is PG for this reason). \n\nAfter seeing this unexpectedly great film, I wouldn't be opposed to a sequel or other future films, especially with the same style as in this film. Perhaps even, this is further motivation to prepare for the 5th installment in a particular franchise in the same universe.",

Bonus \u2764\ufe0f for Perrito & Ethical Bug.\n\nReview: Part 2 - Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was a much better movie than what I thought it was going to be. The movie really does start to step back into the Shrek roots and the animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to pull the feelings into the occurring character development. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a solid return to the world that began in Shrek and features great voice-acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for one wild ride.",

Two characters deserve some criticism, I didn't care for big Jack at all, his physical size was off and didn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie and the wolf, whom I loved, i thought his character was for a much older audience as even the subject of death was a bit much for my kids.",

Where the first movie a decade ago lagged, this one zoomed. Also, the music was great and I was disappointed that I couldn't find the intro theme anywhere online after seeing the film this afternoon. See it if you're debating!",

Being a cat photographer at local animal shelters, I particularly appreciated the scenes of mucho cats at the crazy cat lady's rescue home where poor Puss ended up in, and a subtle revelation by Kitty Soft Paws on the sadness of having declawed paws. I want to see this movie again, and again...and again.",

Only negative, It can get a bit cliche in a few places.\n\nDefinitely recommend this when it officially releases in a few weeks \n\n8.5/10 Stars",
