            "content": "Minha opini\u00e3o: Um filme que \u00e9 um #remaker E da mesma forma que aqui temos uma constela\u00e7\u00e3o de atrizes em 1994 tamb\u00e9m havia. Winona Ryder, Kirsten Dunst, Trini Alvarado, Claire Danes, Susan Sarandon e Christian Bale. Agora nesta vers\u00e3o de 2019 temos Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh Emma Watson, Eliza Scanlen, Meryl Streep, Laura Dern e Timothee Chalamet. Este filme de 94 n\u00e3o assisti. Comecei a ver com grande expectativa o filme, talvez coloquei muito, por isso tenha exigido mais. Confirmo que n\u00e3o fui na totalidade preenchido com a expectativa. Mas n\u00e3o deixa de ser ruim. As atrizes de maior destaque s\u00e3o Ronan e Pugh e Chalamet. Medianos Watson e Scanlen e Streep, Garrel. Abaixo da expectativa Dern. Um filme que passa na \u00e9poca da guerra civil americana, onde os pais das irm\u00e3s esta na guerra. Vivem elas e sua m\u00e3e desde a junventude at\u00e9 mocidade. Os sonhos a levaram cada um por um caminho. Jo vai a cidade grande tentar ser jornalista e escritora, Amy vai a Europa, Meg se casa e Beth se torna pianista. E neste momento existe amor n\u00e3o correspondido e correspondido que envolve Laurie. At\u00e9 que o destino tras ela de volta al\u00e9m do pai que regressa da guerra. Ai lavam a roupa e se resolvem. O filme tem v\u00e1rios cortes de tempos em tempos. E isso n\u00e3o da a profunidade necess\u00e1ria para o filme, pois no momento que parece que vai dar sequ\u00eancia ela corta e passa mais anos e volta. Para mim isso n\u00e3o deixou que se apronfundassem. Uma pena, talvez pulassem menos per\u00edodos e aprofundasse ficaria melhor a estoria. A participa\u00e7\u00e3o de uma atriz como Emma e ser colocada como coadvante de 3\u00ba escal\u00e3o e depois de fazer um filme como a \"Bela e a Fera\" onde teve uma interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o digna de Oscar.\nRoteiro e enredo muito picotado o roteiro. N\u00e3o utiliza de forma boa as atrizes que tem.\nVale apena assistir? sim\nNota: 7",

            "content": "This beautiful journey weaves together multiple subplots to create an emotional and well-executed film. While the movie initially jumps around, by the second half it settles into a rhythm that is emphasised by the talented casting choices.\n\nDespite the grace and elegance that the film exudes, it occasionally misses the mark. Frequent cuts between angles and scenes detract slightly from the emotional impact of some of the cinematic moments, which would have been better served by longer tracking shots.\n\nFurthermore, a consistent theme throughout the movie is lust and hurt, which the film score could have explored more to enhance the story's impact. The film missed an opportunity to elevate itself in the same way that La La Land and Marriage Story did. \n\nOverall, this film is a well-crafted, fantastically acted emotional journey that is much worth the watch.",

In this version the story of the four March sisters (Amy, Jo, Meg and Beth) in the 1860s is told through flashback from their later lives, which at times seems a little confusing and unnecessary. Still, the Jo and Laurie storyline is as heartbreaking as ever in that Anne of Green Gables and Gilbert sort of way. The cast in superb with the March girls really inhabiting their characters. Saoirse Ronan is wonderful as the feisty and energetic Jo, determined to find her own truth in the world and Florence Pugh makes me dislike Meg that little bit less than usual.",

Jo is made to look much prettier than she should be, a fault of both the casting and costuming, and makeup departments. My two biggest issues with the movie are the time jumps which make it hard to understand the movie and how that affects how we see the characters grow and become better people. The movie does not live up to Louisa May Alcott's original vision and message of sisterhood and familial love as the cast has very little chemistry with each other. Even worse is Timothy Chalamets portrayal of Laurie. It's not a bad movie. Its a mostly enjoyable watch. But overall it has many flaws that just don't make it the Little Women we all know and love.",

The camerawork in this movie is incredible, the acting of everyone is so good, with Saoirse Ronan of course as the lead performance and probably the best performance. The production design is just gorgeous, heads off. This movie is so emotional and I am pretty young still, but I watched the movie with my mom and I hit her really hard, I love this movie.",

This is a very good movie, but by comparison I find it too quickly paced, lacking in character development, and just without the heart of the 1994 version.  In particular it's difficult to swallow the decision cast the parts in such a way that they normalize all age differentiations.  I haven't read the book, so I can't say if this choice makes it less faithful but I'm guessing it does.  Obviously the sensibilities of modern times make some of the relationships in the 1994 film cringe worthy, but it is more faithful to the times.  Making everyone seem almost the same age sort of erases the motivations for the characters to be who they are.  For me there's just no substitute for the 1994 version.  I'll cry every time when Claire Danes gives her big speech, but that's because the character was developed without the need for hurry.  This sounds like a terrible review but I'm still giving it 4 stars on its own merits.  Compared to the 94 version it would be 2 stars, but that's a tough movie to be compared to.",

There are not much of difference to the plot from the original book - \"Little Women\" written by Louise May Alcott. This American coming-of-age period drama film really knocked me sideways was despite of the flow of the movie was soothe, the intentions for describing feminisms, women rights, and their role in the society was fully drawn. Personally, I find a scene of Meg, which myself find it was a stroke of exquisite, was when Jo persuaded Meg cancel her marriage to become an actress, though Meg said: \"Just because my dreams are different than yours, doesn't mean they're unimportant. I want a home and a family and I'm willing to work and struggle, but I want to do it with John\". To my mind, feminism nowadays only focus on how women have to have the abilities and positions like men, therefore, housewives are old-fashioned, a waste for future. The character Meg played by Emma Watsons is a brilliant example to clarify the actual - modern definition of Feminisms. In a nutshell, my experience with the 2019 film was satisfy, and I highly recommended this movie.",

The cast is pretty decent overall, with Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Meryl Streep, James Norton and Timothee Chalamet also present. I like that the story has at least an element of female empowerment about it, particularly at the very end. I did cringe at the really 'girly girl' aspects of it and indeed, of course, if your not keen on 'twee' period dramas with giggling female siblings and the like then this may well not appeal to you but even so, I felt this was a well made film and it has enough going for it for the rating I gave it. It won't be for everyone, so I wouldn't outright recommend it to all but if it sounds of interest, if you liked the book perhaps or your keen on the cast, a fan of period dramas and curious about this, then yes, it probably is worth seeing but otherwise, maybe not so much.

The answer is a simple one\u2026 you let Greta Gerwig write an updated screenplay and then let her direct a feature film of her screenplay!\n\nLittle Women was written by Louisa May Alcott and first published in 1868.  It tells the story of the March sisters (Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth) as they transition from childhood to womanhood.  They reside in their childhood home in Massachusetts during the timeframe of the American Civil War.  Their father is away serving as a chaplain in the Union Army.  As the story opens, the four sisters are living in their childhood home with their mother, Marmee.  When word arrives that their father has contracted pneumonia, Marmee heads off to Washington DC to nurse him back to health.   The four little women are now left to their own devices to take care of each other while also determining their fates and futures.  \n\nIn Gerwig's 2019 film, the sisters are portrayed by Saoirse Ronan(Jo), Emma Watson (Meg), Florence Pugh (Amy), and Eliza Scanlen (Beth).  Each actress is absolutely wonderful, and the relationships between the sisters are complex and fully fleshed out.  Mother Marmee is portrayed by Laura Dern, and the girl's crusty and wealthy Aunt March is portrayed by Meryl Streep.  The film captures the era perfectly and the period costumes are simply divine (Best Costume Design would be the film's one Oscar win).  \n\nHuge praise is due to Gerwig for her ability to update the story in ways that resonate with a modern audience.  She deftly cut the story into a non-linear one, bouncing back and forth between time periods.  And her clever twist on the film's conclusion was both interesting and satisfying.  No spoilers!  This movie was a wonderful example of great storytelling, superb acting and topnotch directing.  Despite my familiarity with the story and having seen other versions on-screen, this film was a class act and well worth the viewing.",

The movie was set up to go back and forth between the years as Jo March, one of the main characters, writes her book. One thing I noticed about this film and actually liked, was how they kept the main actors in to play the young versions of the characters when going back in time. It showed how talented the cast was and the range in which they can act. Overall I think it is worth the watch if you are a fan of this heartfelt story. 4/5 stars.",

And more ...\n\n In short, this is a film about the status of women in the mirror of history, and the execution in it is great, whether in the opinion, ambition, and skills that are expressed here in its good script, or in the excellent photography, the amazing acting, and the excellent costume design.\nThe transition between times through flashbacks adds emotion and longing and to my taste was well done.\nNow, in my opinion, this is not an amazing film, but it is on the borderline of very good and amazing, and that is because I think it would not hurt to shorten the script and film by a few minutes.",

            "content": "Little woman 2019, is a drama movie directed by Greta Gerwig, the movie is one of the seven adaptations of the Louisa May Alcott novel of the same name. The main characters are the Four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy and their friend Laurie. They are played by, keeping the same order: Emma Watson, Saoirse Ronan, Eliza Scanlen, Florence Pugh and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. \nThe film tells the lovely story of the March sisters, it takes place in Massachusett during the 19th century. The story tells how they grow up and change, but it also tells very interesting and deep lessons of life with the help of little scenes from the sisters' lives. Some people can find the plot boring but I don't, because the way in which the timeline of the film was shot is different from the one in the book. In the book, the first half follows the March sisters when they are young girls, and the second half consists of their adulthood. In the movie, we have two separate timelines that start in 1861(past) and 1868(present). I must admit that it's a good idea because it helps to get into the film immediately. The plot is a little bit predictable but that doesn't change anything because even if we expect it, it doesn't make the film less moving. \nI think the acting was perfect, all the actors fit in their characters. The scenes were well done and very real thanks to the acting. All the actors managed to give life to their role in this movie, they made them sentimental, sad, angry, all that very well. \nThe shooting techniques are really wonderful, a result of the fact that the film is relatively new. My favorite shots are the ones where you can see the landscape that seems unreal in the background or the ones where you see the four sisters together. All the soundtrack has been realized by Alexendre Desplat. The soundtrack helps a lot to enter into the wonderful atmosphere of the movie. Somes of the music is happy and some are not, it depends on the scene but all the music is adapted with the movie. In my opinion costumes are really important, they can tell a lot about a character. We can see the ones who are negligent, like Jo or the ones who take care of how they look, like Meg and Amy. We also can see the characters who have a relationship with another, like the fact that Jo and Laurie are sometimes wearing the same clothes, it shows that they are close friends. It's also important to be able to find your way in the history and to realize that the film takes place in the 19th century. \nThe film has a lot of messages, each character has something to learn in the movie, for example, the message of Jo's story is that life can be hard especially for a woman and you can't always get what you want but that's not why you should give up. I really like the message of Meg's story, I find it touching, the message is that you don't need to be rich and in high society to be happy, you need to be surrounded by the people you love. \nGenerally, I really think this film is fabulous, maybe one of my favorites. I recommend this film to anyone who loves old drama movies. For the ones who read the book, the film is very similar so if you liked the book go watch the movie. If you haven't seen it yet, you now know what you're missing.",

            "content": "Little Women is a film that I passed on seeing many times, whether it be with friends or with my family, I always chose to not watch it as I figured I wouldn't enjoy it. But boy was I wrong. I watched this film in 2 parts because I was too tired to finish it, but it was the only thing on my mind until I started it again the next morning. That's how you know you're enjoying it.\n\nThe first thing to be noticed is the costuming. Wow. Jacqueline Durann is known for her ability to create period piece costumes, and she was the perfect choice for Little Women. The costumes are seriously gorgeous. Alongside costuming, the set design is beautiful. Greta Gerwig did a great job on picking what this film would look like visually, as every room and landscape is gorgeous and seems to actually be in the right time period.\n\nThe acting in this is phenomenal. Every single character is acted to perfection. The chemistry between each and every actor/actress adds so much to the film and makes it seem so real. And a lot of these are A-list actors and that's very evident because across the board the line delivery and choreography is astounding. Kudos to this entire cast!\n\nThe style of filming is stunning, with scene transitions and offset cameras and long exposure, it's a marvel. With a cinematographer who has not done many big films, he showed off his style in this. I really love how light the scenery and honestly everything is in this entire film, it brings joy and makes for a really fun watch. The camerawork is great too and reminds me of a Wes Anderson movie, very symmetrical and very careful camera movements. \n\nThe last twenty minutes of this film have to be the most magical moments in any film I've seen recently. It's so joyful and so heartfelt and it's hard not to feel so emotional while watching. I could rewatch the ending over and over and over again and never get bored of it. The score and the acting work so perfectly that it's impossible to not want to cry. I'm a sucker for endings that make me cry so here we are. \n\nThere's not much more to be said about Little Women aside from how good this story is and how well it was produced, you just need to see it for yourself. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and I plan on rewatching it soon!",

The relationship between Jo, Amy, and Laurie is so touching my heart that I want to feel that again and make me order the little women's book. Emma as meg and Eliza as beth is also a fantastic performance for them. It was a really weird experience for me because all the way watching this movie. I can't tell what is the main conflict of this story. It is just about a family with 4 sisters trying to pursue their dream. But what makes this movie so beautiful for me is the journey and how the movie takes us there to the conclusion of each character. It is charming, funny, happy, angry, and sad. Amy is the character that can become annoying in the movie, but her annoyance is just pure childish and heartfelt. It doesn't make me mad but instead smiles as another sister also smiles because of the stupid and funny thing she did and said. Any other bad decision that Amy makes and causes pain to another character also becomes something that we can understand why she did it. All I can say is that this movie makes me smile the whole damn movie. And the casting for me in this version is better than the old one with Kristen Dunst as Amy. (maybe it is because I watch the 2019 version first too) Anyway, this movie makes me smile the whole damn movie. So yes it become one of the top 10 films that I love personally.",

            "content": "You burn the only copy of my manuscript, you're going in the ground \u2014 I don't care if we're family. Josephine \"Jo\" March (Saoirse Ronan) showed immense restraint throughout the film, not only by refraining from murdering her younger sister, Amy (Florence Pugh) after she commits the cardinal sin mentioned above, but also by pursuing her dream of becoming a self-sufficient writer during a time when she was expected to marry young (and hopefully rich) and have children. Little Women has been remade six(!) times now. Had it not been for the stellar cast and excellent director (Greta Gerwig), I likely would've never thrown it on. The setting doesn't hurt the film at all. In fact, I enjoyed the outfits, whether they were for fancy balls or something to throw on to go ice-skating, and it made me want to get into vests\u2026 I also found the dialogue to be enjoyable and shots of rural Massachusetts, New York City, and Paris appealing. I like Chalamet in everything, even if the film itself isn't great. I found Pugh to have the most noteworthy performance, however, as the petulant Amy. In a smaller, but not insignificant role, I really enjoyed Tracey Letts as Mr. Dashwood, the publisher. I'd actually like to take the time to give a shout-out to Letts: the guy always delivers and he doesn't seem to get enough recognition. Watching how Jo's book was made is craft porn. I empathized with her when she held it in her hands for the first time \u2014 number one will always have a special place in a writer's heart. My biggest gripe with the film is the timeline, which seems to be a common complaint. It's disjointed and sometimes disorienting, but not even coming close to approaching Tenet levels. Took me a while to get to it, but I highly recommend Little Women whether you think this is your cup o' tea or not.",

The story makes use of it's setting in it's entirety. The struggle with ones aspirations and dreams, with societies  expectations and constrictions, familial and romantic relationships interfering  with friendship makes this story into the work of art it is. \nI recomment this story if you like romance or drama movies in general, stories about emancipation or just the setting during the 19. century.",

It makes no sense to do it in this story. Florence Pugh is awful as Amy. She is forceful when it comes to giving her lines and comes across as mental rather than a child. They should have hired a child actor then adult for Amy. Saoirse Ronan as Jo is also unbelievable though she was better than the others. Emma Watson's feminist ideologies get in the way of her providing a thorough character for Meg. She seems uncomfortable in her skin and it shows. Her performance is greatly lacking. The costume design is horrendous and not Oscar worthy.",

            "content": "THE FATE OF THE MARCH SISTERS\n\n\n\nOver the last century, the novel 'Little Women', written by Alcott, received the attention of a lot of filmmakers. Various films have been made, based on the same storyline of that novel. Sadly, not all films were as successful as the recent film Little women, released in 2019 which was directed by Greta Gerwig. The lead actors delivered an astonishing performance, and the acting skills were incredible. Honestly, I've never been interested in films that are based on novels, because they're usually focusing on the main storyline, instead of bringing the novel into reality. They're almost never as good as the novel itself, which is why this film has been one of the best films I've ever watched. Another reason why I love it is because it's much different from the films of the last decade that mostly involve teenage problems, such as new technology, social media, school, teen romance... On the other side we also have films like 'Little Women' that show us the real side of the old world, mostly about their struggles and economic differences between people. We can see how different poor people and rich people live. That is the main reason why I love this film. \n\n \n\nThe film is based on an amazing but also surprising life of four young sisters, named the March sisters, who are neither rich nor poor. They lived in a happy household with their mother and their maid. Their dad was traveling a lot because of military purposes, and they repeatedly got letters about his well-being, which made them stay connected to him. These young girls had different ways of looking at the world, and they all had dreams that they wanted to pursue. A few involved marriages, love \u2026 but the second oldest sister, Josephine March (also called Jo), had a much different purpose in her life. She wanted to see the world, be adventurous but mostly enjoy life at its fullest without having to give up her freedom. The sisters also wanted to show their artistic talents to the world, such as writing, playing instruments, acting and painting. Once Jo met the young charming boy (named Mr. Laurence), that lived across their house, things began to change and their life got more complicated and mostly exciting. The story of these young girls is an interesting and incredibly beautiful story and is definitely one of the best old like movies ever made. \n\n\nMy first reaction to the film was that I was genuinely surprised about the acting, mainly because of how they managed to fit their roles perfectly. Another reason why I was amazed is that unlike other stories that are made about the 19th century is that this story shows how differently women are treated in the modern days. The story is mostly based on the girls, they're the main characters of the film, which makes them more powerful. In this film the men are more on the sidelines of the story, but they're also there for love interest and role as spectators. Even though the girls still had to deal with sexism in their path, they were strongly enough to break the stereotype that was involved with women at the time. That is something I really liked about the story. Something that made me very happy but also emotional, is how good you could see that the sisters were so close with each other, they lived like best friends. However, the youngest sister Amy and the second oldest sister Jo, had a rivalry or some sort of competition about who would be better because they were very equal, which made the relationships very interesting. Lastly, the thing that made me love the movie even more is how well the March family treated each other and mostly how they were so welcoming to other people around them. They made every single person feel a kind of warmth because of the love they gave, and that brought me a good perspective of how kindness can change the world. \n\n\nDuring the film, I had a lot of questions that made me think about how the story would end. I thought to myself, \u2018What will Jo actually do with her life?', \u2018Will Jo sacrifice her dream and marry a rich man to support her family?', \u2018Will she pursue her dream and actually be an author, or will she give up her dream very easily?', \u2018Who will Laurie get married to?', \u2018How will the girls' life's eventually end and what will their future hold?... Luckily all my questions had been answered at the end of the film, and I was left speechless because of how great the film is. Although there were a few sad scenes, which I personally couldn't accept and that got me very emotional. Lastly, another reason why I loved it, is because every actor was so good at showing the characters' emotions and focus on the fact that this isn't a modern film. They were all dressed heavenly and delivered a lovable performance that made everyone fall in love with them. Therefore, I can say that the film is absolutely stunning. \n\n \n\n\nTo conclude, I can say that the film is much more different than other films. The story revolves around the four girls and has a very interesting storyline. The actors gave us an impression as if it was their live, and they looked breathtakingly gorgeous. We can also say that the big star involved here, is Greta Gerwig. She directed the most entertaining and unique film, alongside the amazing costumes and feminism involved in the story. What I find really disturbing and sad is that she has not been nominated yet for these great performances and works, because I can honestly say that this is one of the best films ever made. This film is a film that I would highly recommend to anyone who likes equality and lovely stories. If you want to feel a lot of emotions at once, this is the perfect film for you. Ultimately, I can truly say this is a cinematic masterpiece.",

Beth passes away, making the sisters see each other after years apart. \n\nDuring their lives, they learn to love, to be independent and to manage the struggles of life. Jo publishes her book and while founding her own school. \n\nThe film was really good, and the cast was on point, and the events that were shown were very similar as the ones written in the book.\n\nI recommend this movie for the people that like love, sadness and adventure all at the same time.",

We've got Emma Watson as Meg, and Laura Dern as the mom: Wild at heart and Blue Velvet spring to mind.\nI can't stop seeing Hermione when I look at Emma Watson..or simply as Emma Watson, but she warmed to the role.  Laura Dern as \"Marmy\" is trite.\nJo's character was anemic. Amy's shrieking had me wish she wouldn't surface. \nAunt March wasn't nearly the cantankerous, familiar old~Pill we all came to love or at least understand. Beth seems like a cardboard cut-out, pale in personality as well as countenance. Would anyone miss her, really?  Though I must admit when she got smallpox she seemed to come to life at last.   Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet was an adequate Laurie, as much as he was allowed to be. Mr. Lawrence was reduced to a distant presence as well. \nEverything moves at a frenetic speed in this latest rehashing of Little Women; including the actor's speech:  Even when Their father returns from the war, he and Laurie enter the room at a breakneck clip before the family descends on them replete with the requisite shrieking that seems to erupt every time any issue arises in this film.\nThere seems to be an awful lot of emoting going on in this film but not much of it felt authentic.\nI feel this version of Little Women glosses over many important moments in the book;\nAll is blatant, with little nuance, while the sound appears to be voiced-over or dubbed in. \nI'll admit, there are poignant moments in this version. Mr. Lawrence with Beth when she plays the piano and the beach scenes between Jo and Beth were quite touching.\nFor a moment or two, I found myself captivated. \nI must admit; I did love the ending.  Jo got her man, [what a cutie Mr. Bhaer is.]\nThe ending was a joyous celebration of the family, with nice upbeat classical music and zero histrionics! Yea!\nP.S.\nFor my money; the 1994 version of Little Women with Susan Sarandon and Winona Ryder will always be the stand-out version, It's heartwarming and truest to the storyline., Don't miss it! \n\n\n.",

Being only Gerwig's second film, she is able to bring a sweet, mature, and lively story back to life from its original creation. This film achieves a lot, but one of the most notable things to me personally are the characters. The four sisters- Meg, Amy, Jo, and Beth -all are unique and stand out from one another. This is, of course, due to the original novel, but it is enhanced by the performances of all four actresses. I believe, of the four female leads, Florence Pugh (portraying Amy) brought forth the strongest performance. Though she is in her mid-twenties portraying an often pre-teen character, her acting was believable, charming, and relatable. In fact, I think what makes the characterization so strong is the ability to relate to them. As a teenage girl myself, I found myself comparing my identity to that of the March sisters, which made me feel closer to the story as it progressed.\nAnother strong aspect of this film was the lighting. I really liked the change in lighting that occured in between the flashbacks and the real scenes. As a viewer, it made it easier to distinguish between the settings and also helped paint the past as good, or at least as a time of nostalgia. This allowed me to further resonate with Jo as she reflected on an earlier time in her life, and helped me put myself into the perspective of the characters.\nOverall, I thought Gerwig was able to create a touching tribute to the original works of the author. This movie, which I have now seen three times, remains one of my favorite for these aspects and more.",

            "content": "(Espa\u00f1ol /English) \n\n In this version of the novel Little Women, the director Greta Gerwig makes two interventions: a permanent alternation between the two times in which it passes (which first disconcerts) and the inclusion of metafictional elements; but at the same time she respects the conventions of romantic melodrama and that combination of innovation and classicism ends up working.\n\n Mujercitas aborda ciertos avatares en la vida de las cuatro hermanas March, sus padres, amigos y pretendientes a partir de la Guerra de Secesi\u00f3n. Una de ellas, Jo,  escribe y se propone ser una escritora independiente (Saoirse Ronan); Amy pinta (Florence Pugh); Meg act\u00faa (Emma Watson) y Beth toca el piano (Eliza Scanlen). Por el momento su madre, Margaret (Laura Dern) se las arregla sola ya que el padre (Bob Odenkirk) se encuentra en el frente, lo que no le impide permanentes tareas solidarias. Hay una t\u00eda acomodada por parte de padre (Meryl Streep) y unos vecinos ricos: un abuelo y su nieto Laurie (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) que siempre anda orbitando a las hermanas.\n\nTanto en la novela original de Louisa May Alcott como en la pel\u00edcula planea el tema de qu\u00e9 grado de independencia econ\u00f3mica pod\u00eda lograr una mujer en esa \u00e9poca y qu\u00e9 oportunidades ten\u00edan de canalizar sus vocaciones, siendo el matrimonio aparentemente el \u00fanico destino posible (y no necesariamente salvador). Algo as\u00ed como el universo de Jane Austin pero en EE.UU. y con las nuevas inquietudes de la \u00e9poca.\n\nCon por lo menos dos versiones cinematogr\u00e1ficas anteriores, en \u00e9sta, la directora Greta Gerwig realiza dos intervenciones fundamentales: una, en la manera de narrar, ya que alterna permanentemente la \u00e9poca de adolescencia de las hermanas con otra posterior a la Guerra, con las chicas m\u00e1s adultas. Este ir y venir crea en principio confusi\u00f3n, ya que toma al espectador por sorpresa. Por otro lado, en la primera parte de la pel\u00edcula, las escenas son m\u00e1s bien corales, lo que sumado al permanente quiebre temporal atenta contra el crecimiento de los personajes y la empat\u00eda por ellos. En la segunda parte, en cambio, y ya costumbrados al mecanismo y con abordajes m\u00e1s focalizados, esta forma de relatar crea paralelismos interesantes y el relato se afianza. (Con una historia muy diferente, un planteo temporal similar funciona desde el comienzo en El jilguero, por ejemplo)\n\nLa otra intervenci\u00f3n, enfatiza el car\u00e1cter autobiogr\u00e1fico de la novela en la figura de la escritora Jo creando interesantes instancias metaficcionales.\n\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1 de esas intervenciones, la realizadora respeta las convenciones del melodrama rom\u00e1ntico, que es el que termina cobrando fuerza con sus desencuentros amorosos y rivalidades. De este modo este relato cl\u00e1sico pero intervenido termina funcionando.\n\nLas actrices j\u00f3venes se lucen en sus interpretaciones, Laura Dern luce expresiva y contenida, la t\u00eda de la infalible Meryl Streep es la voz del establishment y Chalamet aporta un encanto rom\u00e1ntico esencial para su personaje.\n\nLa construcci\u00f3n de \u00e9poca es primorosa mientras que la m\u00fasica de Alexander Desplat es innecesariamente enf\u00e1tica.\n\nEs interesante comparar esta pel\u00edcula con El seductor (The Beguiled), de Sofia Coppola, donde un internado de se\u00f1oritas dirigido por Nicole Kidman acoge a un soldado durante la misma Guerra de Secesi\u00f3n.\n\n..........................................................................................................................................\n\nLittle Women addresses certain vicissitudes in the lives of the four March sisters, their parents, friends and suitors from the Civil War. One of them, Jo, writes and sets out to be a freelance writer (Saoirse Ronan); Amy pint (Florence Pugh); Meg plays (Emma Watson) and Beth plays the piano (Eliza Scanlen). At the moment her mother, Margaret (Laura Dern) manages on her own since her father (Bob Odenkirk) is in front of her, which does not prevent her from permanent solidarity tasks. There is a father's wealthy aunt (Meryl Streep) and wealthy neighbors: a grandfather and his grandson Laurie (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) who is always orbiting the sisters.\n\n\nIn both the original novel by Louisa May Alcott and in the film, she plans the issue of what degree of economic independence a woman could achieve at that time and what opportunities they had to channel their vocations, marriage being apparently the only possible destination (and not necessarily savior). Something like the universe of Jane Austin but in the US and with the new concerns of the time.\n\n\nWith at least two previous film versions, in this one, the director Greta Gerwig makes two fundamental interventions: one, in the way of narrating, since it permanently alternates the time of adolescence of the sisters with another after the War, with the girls more adult. This coming and going creates confusion at first, as it takes the viewer by surprise. On the other hand, in the first part of the film, the scenes are rather choral, which, added to the permanent temporary break, threatens the growth of the characters and empathy for them. In the second part, on the other hand, and already accustomed to the mechanism and with more focused approaches, this way of telling creates interesting parallels and the story takes hold. (With a very different story, a similar temporal approach works from the beginning in El jilguero, for example)\n\n\nThe other intervention emphasizes the autobiographical character of the novel in the figure of the writer Jo, creating interesting metafictional instances.\n\n\nBeyond these interventions, the director respects the conventions of romantic melodrama, which is the one that ends up gaining strength with her love affairs and rivalries. In this way this classic but intervened story ends up working.\n\n\nYoung actresses shine in their performances, Laura Dern looks expressive and restrained, the infallible Meryl Streep's aunt is the voice of the establishment, and Chalamet brings an essential romantic charm to her character.\n\n\nThe period construction is exquisite while Alexander Desplat's music is unnecessarily emphatic.\n\n\nIt is interesting to compare this film with Sofia Coppola's The Beguiled, where a boarding school for young ladies run by Nicole Kidman welcomes a soldier during the Civil War itself.",

But that's all I enjoyed.\n\nThe time jumps are infuriating and a poor choice by the director. You have to pay attention as the characters look exactly the same 7 years ago vs the present time, so if you doze off for a second you may not realize you're in the past. They should have just kept the story linear to not confuse viewers.\n\nMy other issue is that they somehow made all the sisters the most annoying people of all time. In the book, you love each of them and how they make up the family unit even if the characters are not loveable. In this film, I can't feel that they are sisters nor do I feel they love each other. Jo for example does not feel like a tomboy and comes across as a very rude to everyone. Instead of feeling like an older sister, Meg comes off as very fixated on money.  Beth isn't the shy angel as she is in the book, and some of her lines come off as whiny. If they wanted me to hate Amy, well they did a wonderful job because the tone of voice they had the actress use makes me want to plug my ears up. She sounds incredibly rude in every scene. \n\nI love Little Women, but this film's characterization is an insult to the book and the actors.",

            "content": "The 2019 Greta Gerwig film Little Women takes the story of the beloved March sisters and twists it into a barely recognizable film that attempts to please fans of Gerwig's other films. \nDespite being set during the Civil War, there are simply a multitude of mistakes in regards to hair and costuming. For one, anyone with basic knowledge of fashion during this era knows that around the age of thirteen, girls start to wear their hair up. At the beginning of the film, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are 16, 15, 13, and 12 respectively. Meg, the eldest, is supposedly the \"perfect\" sister and follows societal rules but has her hair down for multiple scenes throughout the film. This created an inaccurate portrayal of the eldest March sister which causes confusion as moments later, we see her lecturing Jo about the societal do's and don'ts at the party the sisters go to. Does she care about how she is viewed by society or not? The mistakes made by the costuming department again reflect the lack of accuracy to the time period. In the scene where they deliver food to the Hummels, they brave the cold Massachusetts weather without accurate winterwear. They're poor but how are they to be warm?\nAlthough there is a stark contrast in lighting between the flashbacks and present times, many audience members can easily become confused if they are not familiar with the story or do not pick up on this element. If you are not paying attention, it is not particularly noticeable until halfway through the film and by that point, you are most likely confused about what is happening. The stylistic choice is a good attempt at warm versus cool lighting but could have been introduced after the main characters were established, not used as a form of introducing the March sisters. It yet again creates confusion for the audience.\nThis switching between the past and present is not the only problem with the construction of the film. The timeline of events is inaccurate to the books and makes major disputes between the sisters seem like small childish quarrels. When Amy destroys Jo's novel, the two make up in the next scene as if no time has gone by since the incident. Generally speaking, characters are simply written inaccurately to the original character in the novel. The original message of family and the bond between sisters turns into a modern and inaccurate adaptation. This is perfectly exemplified with Marmee's line \"girls have to go into the world and make their own minds about things.\" This is the Civil War, not modern 2019. \nIn sum, Gerwig tries to make a beloved classic into a modern crowd-pleasing film while giving up the integrity of the characters and the original work. The message of family and its importance is lost upon the audience. Instead, the audience roots for the sisters as individuals instead of as a family. Overall, it is a poor attempt at a beloved classic.",

I actually thought that the entire character fell flat this time around. Also, Amy was much too old. The flashback scenes of the girls younger days made the movie seem rushed and it took away from all of the great character development we get to see in the other versions, when it starts out at the beginning instead of flashing back and forth. It may be a trend to remake old classics with their own spin on the story, but this was a classic that didn't need to be spun, at all. Honestly, it didn't need to be remade to begin with, but if you insist on taking on something like this at least find actors and actresses who can do it justice. The actress who played Jo was tolerable and Emma Watson was lovely, but that's it. I would tell anyone to skip this newest version and instead watch the 1994 and/or the 1949 versions.

And Gerwig too does a great job at capturing the romantic tone of the novel and the ambiance of the period.  However, it tries to get a little meta in its shifting time frames and parallel storytelling; which can get kind of confusing.

But we reckoned without the consummate skill of writer-director Greta Gerwig, who finds an unexpected approach to the story that would sound oddly meta in the description but that works superbly in execution. It helps, of course, to have such a stellar cast - one which proves the need for 'Best Ensemble' awards; it's redundant and unfair to pick one performer from the almost universally excellent line-up. Throw in some beautiful cinematography, and this is a beautiful, warm embrace of a film that still emotionally satisfies. There are occasional misfires: the cursory nod to slavery and racism seemed tokenistic to me, but I may have misread that. And Meryl's Streep character and performance seem to me to lapse too much into genre trope territory in an otherwise nimble film. But ultimately this is a film that leaves you smiling, the sort of thing you'll want to watch and rewatch over Christmas holidays, seeing something fresh each time and enjoying everything that feels familiar in all the right ways.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this movie! I did not know the story as I had not read the book nor watched previous versions so to me it was all knew and it got to me. The story is a little confusing at first with its many characters and some jumping through different time periods but after some time introducing the main characters, the film finds its pace and becomes lovely. The center of it is a young woman, Jo, who has three sisters and the dream of becoming a writer. Her family is poor but seems to be one with large amounts of love, freedom and creativity that makes these girls so different from the apparent average of the 19th century. Jo is a writer, Amy is a painter, Meg is an actress and Hannah plays the piano, talents that not all of them treat as their future, maybe because being a wife seems to be their only possible vocation. These characters are so naturally powerful that you don't really question how rare it must have been to find this level of freedom in women in an age in which dreaming of anything other than marrying a rich man sounded outrageous or nonsense. People did not expect women to succed and it is clear right in the first scene, when Jo tries to sell a novel to a publishing company and the editor likes it but believes no one will want to read about a woman that does not get married or dies in the end (any other option simply does not make sense in his mind). Jo's best friend is a rich a young boy who is a neighbor and shares some of its wealth with her family. The couple has a connection that feels true and natural but she seems so focused on finding her independency that love takes the second plan in her mind. In a way this to me is the main theme of the movie: how the idea that marriage was a financial decision for women had large impacts on their lives and dreams. Some of them might understand that marriage should be lead by love and not wealth, others might fight so hard against it that love becomes an almost neglected feeling, many might succumb to the pressure. However, any path that is taken has a strong presence of this overwhelming feeling that women just won't get there alone. The movie flows very well after a slightly slow start when its base is being built, then it is wonderful. The photography is amazing and at several moments it just seems like you are watching a paiting or even reading poetry, the acting is fantastic with an incredible cast, the dialogues are powerful and beautifully written even when it seems that too much is being said to us. I loved Lady Bird as well and I cannot wait to see what Greta Gerwig will do next.",

This style brings a rich meaning to aspects of all of the characters and their relationships. I love the way this was done. Of course this period piece is full of beautifully videographed scenery and it is obvious that a lot of attention was given to detail. Delicious. \nWhat I thought I might find here in the way of complaint was that in order to follow the events and the flip flopping between past and present, it seems necessary to have read the book and if you have read the book, You may have already formulated an image of Amy. And Amy might not seem like you imagined her - or at least she wasn't as I imagined. This version of her was a much stronger character with sharper edges. I personally didn't fall in love with her  or sense the passion between her and Lori but was amazed at the believability of the youthful as well as the grown up Amy. The acting in this film was real talent. Often, I am annoyed by the casting of recognizable actors and actresses in films like this but Meryl Streep and Emma Watson while recognizable and solid in their parts did not overact or steal attention from the others. No single role stole the show. It was a well balanced story of all characters. I was drawn in. I had to love it.",

Time kept jumping back and forth in this version, and I had to look for clues to see where we were in the timeline. It also seemed like they kept interjecting political talking points at random spots in the movie. I'm not against political messages; it just seemed particularly forced here. The emotions didn't seem real here, either. Sometimes they came across as Hallmark characters on Prozac. The Christmas breakfast scene seemed logistically impossible, and that really bothered me. I had the same problem here as I did with the previous versions: the plot for this story just isn't all that compelling. The photography, clothing and set design were great, though, so there's that.",

We are blessed with a surprising allstar cast, beautiful cinematography, typically sharp writing and directing and a well-paced story where everything feels essential, all as always. I disagree with those who say it's overlong but agree that it's main flaw it it's confounding nonlinear structure set in the blue end of the timeline and the yellowish-orange 7 years prior. All the jumping around is confusing, as well as how vaguely we are told of events and how it intertwines with the author's stories. It doesn't add much to jump around so much, other than to challenge it's audience to figure out it's complex timeline. The ending also felt abrupt, but as I am new to the Little Women property, I cannot say if this was in the original novel or millions of screen adaptations before. I absolutely reccomend it nonetheless. 8.75/10.",

The side characters were diverse and also incredibly well acted, one in particular did so well that his character was my favorite. The costume, make-up and stage design team brought the 1860's to (though in kind of a prettied up and Disney like fashion). The narrative was engrossing and kept me entertained throughout. \n\nThis movie is clearly a romantic drama, but doesn't feel like it relied on any of that genre's tropes. There was a really fascinating dual timeline element, that kept you guessing and helped the pace of the movie tremendously.

It is the first adaptation I've seen that doesn't make Amy out to be a villain but instead dives into the complexity of each girl and represents their own personal struggles- something the book had clearly done. The rearranging of the timeline was done in the most tasteful way, marking time jumps with an obvious yellow filter and differences in the characters' wardrobe and hair styles. Arranging it in this way allowed for audiences to see the parallels between the childhood and adult girls and how they were shaped to become who they are. It caused me to think completely differently about a story I thought I knew by heart. Her writing was also completely immersive. Paired with the outstanding performances, the film was completely natural, allowing a full immersion into their world for the full 2 hours and 15 minutes.

I can usually hang tight with films that go back and forth in time, but I found this to be an annoying approach in this film. I know what the writer and director, Greta Gerwig, was trying to do, but I don't feel she pulled it off all that particularly effective. Flashbacks and movement of different time periods in a film need to be perfectly fluid and timed (pun intended), and I just found that was not present here (if interested, a perfect example of successfully accomplishing this film technique can be found in the sublime film, THE HOURS). But LITTLE WOMEN is hardly a bust.  Ronan as Jo is terrific, although she really can't hold a candle to Florence Pugh's unadulteratedly and ambitiously robust performance as Amy.  Pugh takes a truly annoying character like Amy and gives her heart, gives her all kinds of crazed character colors, and this is because Pugh is an actress of great range and depth. Pugh just blew me away in last year's MIDSOMMAR, and she just keeps getting better and better one brilliant performance after another and is undoubtedly Oscar-bound. And I supe- loved the ending of the film, watching Jo's book getting published in that old way that books were once published with bindings and glue and fabric, basically before self-publishing and blogs and online readings found their place.  It gave me chills, and the character of Jo inspired me to always stay true to my artistic vision, NEVER compromise, and to ALWAYS and ONLY write from my heart and my truth and my soul.

            "content": "From director Greta Gerwig, coming off her 2017 critical darling \"Lady Bird\", comes the sixth cinematic adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's beloved book \"Little Women\". Following the goings on of four sisters in 1868 Massachusetts seeing their journey from childhood to adulthood, experiencing love and sorrow as they must come to terms with what lies ahead in their future. Thanks to the masterful oversight of Gerwig we get to observe said journey in such an authentically beautiful way. \n\nThe film already feels like a classic that one might look upon with nostalgia, perhaps this can be accredited to the film's heavy thematic attention to nostalgia. Jumping between present day and the past, it gives the feeling that these flashbacks are childhood memories reappearing as the characters think back on a simpler time. Thankfully Gerwig shows constraint to not force feed us through text appearing on the screen reading \"a few years earlier\" or use blatant expository dialogue, and despite this the non-linear plot never feels confused. The choice to construct the story in such a way makes for great engagement and pace, helping to maintain the audience's attention.\n\nThis distinction of time is successfully achieved thanks to cinematographer Yorick Le Saux's expert attention to colour. The warm hue of the past reflecting the joys and splendours of their childhood creates for a stark contrast to the blue coldness of the present. But while these periods differ so significantly, they are both composed of equally beautiful components. One can give much praise for this to the choice to shoot using film as opposed to digital. Giving the illustrious costume and production design of the film its true medium in which to shine. The grain of the filmstock works well in tandem with the 19th Century period of the film, giving further depth and life to the warmth of the candlelight and the snow-covered exteriors. The way the camera is able to capture the materials and colours of the period reminiscent of a great painting of the time. You can give partial thanks to Steven Spielberg for this who not only suggested, but practically begged Gerwig to utilise film once he caught word that she would be adapting the story to the screen.\n\nBut what the film is dependant upon to tie all of this together is the characters, and the respective actors who have been tasked to portray them, and they are nothing short of stellar. Each member of the cast brings such charisma to the screen, and the comradery and feeling of true sisterhood from the central four characters is palpable. While many film casts will say how well they got along on set, for \"Little Women\" you can feel a genuine sense of chemistry. They feel like a real family, bickering back and forth, laughing together, and caring for each other. It is the great care that the characters show for one another which is so infectious as the viewer finds themselves becoming deeply invested in the lives of these four sisters. \n\nThe two standouts however would have to be Saoirse Ronan as Jo and Florence Pugh as Amy. With Ronan displaying expertly the range of Jo's journey from joy, whimsy, and passion, to devastation, cynicism, and rejection. Whilst Pugh gives genuine humanity to Amy as she grows from a mischievous child to a mature woman. \n\nIt is refreshing to see such a sweet, warm, and ultimately uplifting film. While one may say that at times it is bordering on saccharine, that would be doing a disservice to Gerwig and the casts ability to engage the audience with captivating drama and emotion. One moment the film fills you with a sense of childhood joy, the next emphatic sorrow for its characters, but never does it feel tonally inconsistent, conveying the masterful work of Gerwig's adapted script. \n\nWhilst watching the film it appears as a mere slice of life, simply observing the days in the life of these sisters, the film in the end reveals how throughout its runtime it has been building up to a satisfying and almost profound feeling of a clearly defined journey from beginning to bitter sweet end. Displaying how it was ultimately about growing up, developing some semblance of autonomy, and figuring out one's place in the world. With all this Gerwig has truly shown the world how to successfully adapt a classic novel to the contemporary cinema scene.",

No, just, NO! Zero chemistry there. I didn't know Bob Odenkirk was going to be in this and I about busted out laughing when I saw him on the screen.  All of Joe's outfits looked like something from an Anthropologie catalog, and this won an award for costume design? Laurie looked and acted like he was 15 years old the whole way through; showed no signs of maturity and by the end he was supposed to be married? It was just not believable.

How dare you disparage such a classic story with your dull wit? The work of Greta Gurwig is not meant to be trifled with! Truth is, while this movie has a lot going for it, I do have some problems.\n\nLet's talk about the good stuff first, though. There is some truly stellar acting here. Everyone pulls their weight, and ensemble scenes are just everyone raising each other to new heights. My personal favourite was Florence Pugh, she played the \u2018bratty but excitable younger sister' role exceptionally well. Another standout was Laura Dern, who has really been killing it lately with her roles.\n\nThe story is nice, too. There are high points, and low points, and even a nice framing device. You end up loving these characters and you understand their motivations very clearly.\n\nMy issue lies with the editing. You are constantly jumping around in time, and the cues you are given to understand these jumps are inconsistent. I still don't know at what point Jo cut her hair. Also, it seems to me that [CENSORED]'s death should have been the emotional climax, but because of the editing, we see them again after the death scene? It just doesn't work that well for me.\n\nIf you don't mind non-linear storytelling, you will likely appreciate this more than I. Provided, of course, you can get over the fact that they are all full-size women.\n\n*runs out of the room as books are pelted at him*",

All these highlights in this story of family and neighborly lovingkindness. An oh-so-much-needed reminder that such grace can be known and told in these venomous times. Yet, I agree with viewers that the  flashbacks and fantasies (Jo's dream of Beth's recovery, for example) gave the story a bit of a jagged edge.

Saoirse Ronan is solid as always, serving up an empowered version of Jo March, as Alcott's fictional alter ego.  While Florence Pugh adds strong supporting work, playing Amy with welcome dignity.  Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper headline the senior roles, providing the gravitas lacking from the 1994 version of their characters.  Only Timothee Chamelet seems miscast as a too boyish Laurie. \n\nGerwig deserves all the credit she's receiving for somehow reviving a staid story in it's 7th (12th including TV versions?) go around.  Her version possesses superior character development, and most originally, her masterful use of time jumping vignettes.  She basically cut the book up and pastiched it back together in a more cinematic manner. Bravo! \n\nUnfortunately she eschews more deliberate identifiers, like date/location stamps, for more subtle hints, like alternating colour hues between scenes and stylistic changes for the characters. While the increased activity adds welcome excitement to her telling, it also results in a periodic sense of displacement too.\n\nThose viewers familiar with the source material will follow, and newcomers will find their way. But the challenges persist in pivotal scenes involving the relapse of beloved sister Beth, and when Jo negotiates a deal while the character in her book lives out the editor's requested fantasy ending.\n\nThis is a bold return to Alcot's seminal work, loaded with vibrant energy and cinematic beauty.  Gerwig's occasionally unwieldy screenplay distracts, but recreating such classic source material is no simple task.  And the result feels both vital and timely.  Who knew these little women had it in them.",

I saw it the first time with my mom, whose movie interests run very narrow (she's basically only into period dramas/romances and romantic comedies). Neither of us was familiar with the Little Women story before watching this movie. The things I liked: the acting was fantastic. Ronan is consistently one of the best actors around. Dern is indomitable in everything she does, Chalemet is an annoyingly charming and capable performer. Florence Pugh is going to be a SUPERSTAR - I couldn't take my eyes off of her (in this or any of her other performances this year). The script was great - it felt modern in a lot of ways, which I appreciated. I appreciated the transitions between warm and cool tones to differentiate between scenes in the present and those in the past. The direction of the ball scene was super cool. And I super enjoyed the open/vague ending. If this is a Gerwig innovation (haven't read the book), it's really brilliant. The things I didn't love: I understand that she's done 8 trillion films and is consistently excellent, but I'm tired of Meryl Streep. Emma Watson was the acting weak link. And as modern as the story felt at times, as much as they tried to at least (lightly) reference the cultural/political context of the period, as compelling as the acting was... very little of this felt fresh. It's been done. It's been seen. I am ready to see more stories about non-White, straight cis women navigating patriarchy and love and independence and friendships and family dynamics in this time period (and others) in ways that aren't deficit-based, clichd, or solely about their suffering. It's why Portrait of a Lady on Fire felt like such a breath of fresh air. These Little Women got to be so human, and it was beautiful to see I felt moved by it throughout the film. And I want to see it happen across more identities and about people that are generally approached with less nuance and humanity. And I want to celebrate, make visible the people doing that work already.",

Saoirse Ronan is one the most brilliant aspects in this movie as Jo March and as soon as I see her character on screen I instantly hooked, not to forget Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson, Laura Dern and practically almost everybody giving a great performance. The scores really fit in every scene, scenery, setting and the beautiful costumes blend within a great camera work. However, despite all of those great things I personally lost sense of time in a couple of scenes, I couldn't figure out which scene is the flashback or the one occurring in the present because there's no clear clue in the film except the beginning of the first act, unfortunately, the confusing timelines happen in some of the crucial scene resulting in a little bit drag in the pacing. Overall, it's still an entirely wonderful movie.",

The plot of this movie was so well written it made you want to see what happened next, and the tragic death of Beth was so sad it almost made me want to cry. The one problem that I had was I got a little confused when they changed from past to present. I do understand the transitions now, but I wish the transitions were a little more clear. It was very smooth when they went from present to past or either way, but I still couldn't understand some of it.

The changes here weren't too ham-handed, I thought anyway.  My biggest beef with it was that it was kind of confusing.  I know the story well enough that I wouldn't have thought that possible, but they were jumping back and forth between timelines and they used the same actors throughout--we were supposed to buy into adult women playing the child versions of the little women--and it was pretty hard to follow at times.  And if you DIDN'T already know the story it would kind of....ruin it for you.  I didn't quite understand the logic of presenting the story in this strange order other than to be...interesting.  I'm a traditionalist, I know, but I feel like telling the story in chronological order allows you to build up the right kind of relationship with the characters.  Otherwise, the acting was amazing, the casting was great, the costumes and the cinematography were beautiful.  My 11-year-old daughter and I both really enjoyed it.

The film is old-fashioned while also being quite lively and fun, and it is technically gorgeous to behold \u2013 the costumes are absolutely amazing, the production design is splendid, the score is very good and the attention to detail in recreating its time period is remarkable. Its heart is always in the right place, its portrayal of women is complex and profound, and the character development is truly phenomenal. The standout aspect is the perfect casting with everyone delivering a terrific performance \u2013 Saiorse Ronan is incredible as complex Jo, Emma Watson is lovely as very likable Meg, Timothee Chalamet is quite charismatic in the role of Laurie, Meryl Streep is hilarious as wealth-obsessed Aunt March and Florence Pugh herself is a revelation, playing fascinatingly complicated Amy with a tremendous confidence.",

            "content": "Greta Gerwig does something different with her adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's \"Little Women\". With so many adaptations in existence, she needed to do something to stand out. The adaptation works completely.\n\nAmy (Florence Pugh), Beth (Eliza Scanlen), Jo (Saoirse Ronan) and Meg (Emma Watson) are sisters growing up during the Civil War. Amy is the feisty, youngest sister who dreams of being the best artist; Beth is the musically talented sister with the most health issues; Jo is the writer who defies all traditional female roles and Meg wants to live a domestic life. The story begins in the future and is told via flashbacks starting seven years prior.\n\nApparently some found the use of the flashbacks confusing, but once the film truly gets going it's easy to differentiate between the time periods. I've read the book so I knew what was the past and what was the future. Still, I thought it was easy to differentiate between the time periods regardless. Most of the scenes that take place in the past involve the sisters' neighbor Laurie (Timothee Chalamet). The cinematography is also bleaker in the future as it matches Beth's declining health.\n\nGerwig does a great job of making all the characters sympathetic. She also does a great job of showing that all the sisters' life decisions are worthy in their own way because they're living their truths. All the actresses do a great job as well. Ronan has the difficult job of portraying the strong willed sister that has few moments of vulnerability, and those moments she really lets her emotions through. Watson and Scanlen also do great in their roles. The standout for me was Pugh. She portrays Amy as a young girl all the way to being a young woman and she is able to portray that childlike wonder while also showing us her maturity once she's of age.\n\nThe main focus of the film is womanhood. It shows that every woman might desire something different from someone else, and regardless of the decisions made, they're valid. Some of the sisters also end up doing something vastly different with their lives than they initially imagined. The problems they faced as women growing up in the 1800s are in many ways still relevant today. Gerwig portrays all of these ideas masterfully.\n\nThe film has beautiful moments as well as heartbreaking ones. The sisters never feel like caricatures regardless of their life experiences.",

            "content": "I loved Little Women! I went into this movie knowing nothing about the source material and in most cases I probably wouldn't have been interested in seeing it at all, yet alone in theaters. However, when I saw Greta Gerwig was directing and Saoirse Ronan was playing the lead, I made sure I saw it as soon as I could. \n\nLike I said, I knew nothing about the story going in, so watching all the character work and plot developments unfold was deeply captivating. The March sisters and their entourage are all likable and the story doesn't feel antiquated at all, despite being 150 years old. Its one of those escapist period pieces where you just feel immersed in the time period and want to spend more time there. You wanna spend more time with this family. It's over two hours long, but it doesn't feel like it. The film breezes by on whimsy and charm. The cast is surprisingly star-studded and the acting is all top-notch. Saoirse Ronan has quickly become one of my favorite actresses. The life and personality she brings to the role is just incredible to watch. Everyone embodies their character so well that I didn't even mind Emma Roberts' accent slipping from time to time.\n\nMy favorite character was Jo, played by Ronan, which makes sense because the Little Women Personality Test said I'm a Jo. She's definitely the focus and I would be lying if I said her relationship with the young aristocrat Laurie didn't have me swooning and rooting for romance. \n\nGerwig 100% got robbed for a Best Director nomination. To take this Civil War-era story and make it feel fresh is no small feat and she achieves it seemingly without effort. I doubt all the adaptations are this good! The setting and costumes are so simple, yet there's so much life in them. When it's warm, it feels warm. When it's cold, it feels cold; not just in the visuals, but in tone. \n\nIn conclusion, Little Women is excellent. It doesn't feel old and it's not too harsh, so anyone at any age can enjoy it. It's about women, but don't think that makes it inaccessible to men, who I genuinely think will like it as well. Its funny when it needs to be. It's emotional when it needs to be. It's relatable, surprisingly timely and overall, it's just a good time. Go see It because I want to see more movies like this. Call me selfish, I don't care! I want Gerwig-Ronan movies every Oscar season for the next 20 years! More Little Women's & Lady Birds can only be a good thing",

I'm a feminist, but seriously women weren't speaking like that in that era. I'm not a huge fan of the jumping between time that movies love to do these days. People who never read the book can easily get confused. It takes away from the story. I greatly prefer the version with Winona Ryder as Jo, and Susan Sarandon as Marmee. I honestly can't fathom how it got nominated for an Academy Award. Besides the Scenery and Costumes, it was very disjointed in it's storyline. It did deserve the Academy Award for Costumes.

The moments where the women \"made a stand\" to say something about the society's restrictions also felt cheap and manufactured. Gerwig could have done so much more with this story, even without \"changing\" it to some sort of activist message.. just develop the characters into real people rather than spoiled, privileged people who say nothing of importance - nothing we haven't already heard before. The film was a cliche snooze in nearly all aspects. I should note that I am a queer feminist too.. this film worked to uphold gender stereotypes, cliche notions of love, cliche notions of people who step outside of leading a \"normal\" existence. It pointed to the sexism inherent in any patriarchal society, but it didn't do enough to critique it in my eyes. The woman changes the book at the end to fit into the stereotyped stories for and about women (and therefore men).. separating the sexes even further. Gerwig does nothing that makes any sort of new cultural insertion into this conversation. I would suggest not giving this film your time.",

Emma Watson could just not pull off the part of the  proper, reserved oldest sister, Meg. Laura Dern, as  Mrs March ( the mother)  came across as shallow and plastic. And of course the brief conversation her character has in a scene with a black woman, near the beginning of the film, about how she was ashamed, and is still ashamed of America, came from no part of this classic novel, and was just another vehicle to spew Hollywood hate. \nThe young actor playing \"Theodore Lawrence\" looked far too young and effeminate for the part. He did the best he could in a part for which he had been miscast. \nThe way the movie unfolded, starting practically with the end of the novel as we have known it, then jumping back and forth to flesh out the characters and lend explanation to events, was irritating. And unless you are already familiar with this classic story of the March family, I think you might find it confusing..\nI have never seen a movie that so compelled me to voice such negative review. Until now.\nDon't  waste your money.",

Each with their own well developed personalities, you may think it would be tricky to truly explore everyone in 2 hours but the director did a fantastic job. Little Women chronicles the lives of four sisters over about a 10 year period, and instead of playing the story chronologically, the movie is arranged connecting moments from the girls childhood to their adult years. You may think this constant switching back and forth would be confusing and hard to follow, but the production team made it clear by aging the characters and displaying events from the girls childhood with a warmer filter and events from later on with cool tones.\n\n\n\nI saw this movie with friends and we all throughly enjoyed it.

The fourth big screen adaptation Alcott's novel, written and directed by Greta Gerwig, finds a fresh approach to the lives of the March sisters without making any major changes to the well-loved story. Gerwig uses a flashback structure, a steady and lively pace, equally lively performances, and a lovely score by Alexandre Desplat to make this period drama easily engaging to a modern audience. \n\nGerwig begins her film near the end of Alcott's story with Jo (Saoirse Ronan) living in New York trying to carve out a career as a fiction writer. Her sisters are scattered and wrapped up in their adult lives. Meg (Emma Watson) is raising a family and keeping a house while struggling with money. Amy (Florence Pugh) is learning painting in Europe. Only selfless and caring Beth (Eliza Scanlen) remains with their parents at the March family home in Massachusetts. Then the film flashes back to where to the novel and other film versions begin, with the sisters as adolescents living together under one roof with their mother, Marmie (Laura Dern, with infinite patience and warmness and wisdom). Their father is away serving with the Union army in the Civil War. It is seven years before we began with Jo living in New York.\n\nThere is real joy and emotion in the scenes of the March sisters together (that's the appeal of watching any version of Little Women) but we get time with each of the sisters on their own. We get to know them as individuals and are privy to what is in their minds and hearts. Gerwig put together a fine ensemble but Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh have been singled out by the Academy with Oscar nominations in the Lead and Supporting categories, respectively. This is no surprise since Jo and Amy are the two showy roles.\n\nRonan brings just the right kind of energy to the rebellious, strong willed, sometimes abrasive, but always charming, Jo. She is full of life and personality without becoming a caricature. On the other hand, I found Florence Pugh's performance as the youngest sister Amy (a child when the novel begins) so broad as to be distracting. Pugh plays Amy throughout the film, but the younger Amy's behavior and actions have not been altered in any significant way. So, in the flashbacks we see an adult Florence Pugh speaking and acting like a child even though she looks like a teenager at the youngest (even with her Cindy Brady haircut). This unfortunately makes the younger Amy come off as odd and extra bratty.\n\nTimoth\u00e8e Chalamet is a perfect fit for the role of Laurie, the dreamy and charming boy next door destined to be intertwined with the March sisters. Chalamet brings a lively physicality to his performance, moving his long, slender body with a lilt that matches the energy of the movie. In smaller but no less entertaining roles are Meryl Streep and Tracy Letts. Streep plays the intimidating and acerbic Aunt March, who is rich enough to be able to speak her mind. She is full of 19th century quips and zingers that are delivered wonderfully. Letts plays a grumpy New York publisher that is willing buy Jo's stories if they are spicy and if Jo's female main characters get married at the end, or die. Jo's conversations with him are entertaining but also come right up against being too meta for the movie's own good (if you weren't sure about Jo being a stand-in for Alcott, these scenes leave no doubt).\n\nI have to admit that as much the jumps back and forth in time work for the overall structure of the film some of the cuts are not immediately apparent and it takes a moment to figure out where you are in the timeline. Once you get into the rhythm of the pacing, however, you'll find yourself caught up in the film's enthusiasm and love for its characters. Right from the start this version of Little Women lets you know that it is not a pageant, not just another recreation of a familiar story, but a new perspective on a classic story that gets to the core of what makes this story timeless. The climax of Gerwig's adaptation, is not whether or not Jo gets married and to whom, but how she is able to stay true to herself and her dreams and her family.",

Wow.\n\nMake no mistake, despite the wealth of talent around her, this is Soirose's movie. She gives the performance of the year, male or female, as Jo, in this delightful adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's beloved novel. \n\nFlorence Pugh, nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, is also magnificent as the bratty Amy. I was unaware of Pugh before this film, but she is one to watch. \n\nDirector Greta Gerwig was overlooked, perhaps partially due to some backlash over the frequent time shifts in the film (to be honest, there are times when it took me a minute to two to figure out what time period we were in), but she does a terrific job of bringing these oft-portrayed characters with a fresh look. This was a surprising treat and is one of the best films of 2019.",

Little Women worked for me on the same level that most Jane Austen adaptations work. It has several moments that get boring, but I get so involved in the characters\u2019 lives that I want to see how their story ends anyways. Ordinarily, I\u2019d say there was a risk of me falling asleep with a movie like this, but I cared about the titular women (which makes all the difference.) The cast in this adaptation is quite good, and there are a number of powerful moments that they deliver with all the emotion required. I liked the inventive way that they bounced back and forth between the present and the past. At first it would take a moment to ground myself and figure out we had changed time period, but eventually there were key indicators you could count on to place yourself in the timeline. Unfortunately, I found myself crying much less in Little Women than I would expect for this kind of story. There are several moments that were clearly meant to bring out the emotions, and I worried that I should have brought more tissues, but I barely got misty-eyed. That is unlike me, but I think there was something lacking in the way they were presented, because I could see every one of the moments coming. My other big complaint with the way this film was presented is some of the clunky ADR lines they shove in for no good reason. Over the past few years, I\u2019ve become painfully aware of when the director dubs in a line when we can\u2019t see a characters\u2019 mouth move, and pretends it was there from the start. The two most blatant occurrences of this technique were throw-away lines that added noting to the film. In fact, one of them was answered mere minutes later on screen. So, it wasn\u2019t a perfect film-going experience for me, but the quality of the story-telling and acting were such that I enjoyed myself anyways.",

This showed in every scene; Gerwig and her Actors created the joyful chaos of a house full of siblings. The bickering, the talking over one another and the laughter. Shot in film instead of digital was a brilliant choice for a period piece and the cinematography was breathtaking. Costume design was a highlight for me. The sumptuous materials of the dresses looked like were flowing out of the screen and could so easily be touched.  Stand out performances from Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Florence Pugh. Both seem so effortless in their genius acting choices. Disappointingly Gerwig has not been nominated an Academy award for directing and neither has it's Cinematographer however it's costume designer has so we may have a winner here.",

            "content": "The most overrated film of 2019 by far. I wand to preface this review by saying that this instalment was the first version I saw of \"Little Women\" and I have not read the book. I am just baffled by the good reviews this director and consequently this film has received and it makes me wonder who is really writing these reviews and what credentials and knowledge about film they actually possess. Gerwig misses everything when it comes to character development, plot, theme and even following a coherent storyline. The flashbacks are so awkwardly integrated into the story that it becomes very difficult to follow. The fact that the actors/actresses don't seem to age (Florence Pugh playing also the younger version of Amy March in a rather childish and awkward performance) does not help, nor does the lack of any kind of maturing process. All roles seem to be caricatures and ideas without any substance. We are unaware of inner or outer conflicts until they are presented to us in the end. Lori was in Love with Jo...I didn't know. Jo was in love with the professor...I didn't know. Jo was dying to go to Europe...I didn't know. Jo was facing prejudice as a female writer...I didn't know. Meg wanted to be an actress...I had no idea! It goes on and on. I didn't care about Beth dying, I didn't care about any of the characters because they were not developed at all. One has to go back to the 1994 version to really understand and get an idea why this beloved novel had been turned into a film so many times. And it's so simple. One look between Christian Bale (Lori) and Wynona Ryder (Jo) and his love for her is clear. The most basic forms of storytelling are simply missed. When Beth dies, I had no emotional connection to her because I didn't get her struggle. She was completely irrelevant and I also didn't get her connection to her sisters and what she represented. What did I miss? How did I not care about someone dying? If anyone watches Clair Danes in the 94 version, one cannot keep their eyes dry not only because of a wonderful performance, but because we feel for her, we know her, we understand who she was within this family. Gerwigs film doesn't even scratch the service not only of these characters, but the theme altogether. I was shocked by the mere absence of what the novel supposedly set out to do: to tell a story about women empowerment in a time when women were meant to do nothing else but taking care of the home and the children. Gerwigs decide to change history and present us with a newspaper editor who presents to conflict to the theme whatsoever. We are presented with a family dynamic that seems everything but surpressed. We are presented with women who are already free to choose, without the pressure of finding a rich husband to secure their future. What is the point of this film? What is it trying to portray or tell the audience if no conflict is present in regards to female empowerment and yet this director and the film are plastered with MeToo praises in a world that turns mediocrity  into a weapon...but an ineffective one. So many of these actor's performance are rendered bizarre and useless as the writing turns them into mere result driven puppets. If anyone truly wants to understand and feel these characters to the fullest, please go back and watch Gillian Armstrong's rendition of it. Sadly, this female director didn't have the fortunate circumstance to make her film in a \"MeToo\" era and yet should be much more praised for making a feminist film with wonderful female characters in a time when it wasn't fashionable. It's should be about the quality of what we make, not about who is behind it.",

But to me the way she tried to fuse the two just didn't work: the scenes that were most faithful to Alcott were sentimental and diminished: and then in scenes she wrote herself, the dialogue sounded akin to what women would say a hundred years after the films time. I also did not think the scrambled chronology worked: I know the story well and yet was unsure from scene to scene where we were: childhood, teen years, or adult years. Back and forth, in and out: the jumping around kept me from connecting with any of the characters: It would be like a person changing their clothes every 15 minutes over a long lunch: so distracting! What a shame. I loved a few things: the sets and historical details were very interesting to me; I found the male characters, especially Laurie, compelling and less confusing than the women. And some of Jo's bravery was moving; but while critics and viewers seem to love this version, I just felt it was a flop. I still think Greta is a wonderful artist-look forward to seeing whatever she does next.",

It delves deeper than any other version focusing on siblings Amy and Beth's character arcs more than we've seen before. It was refreshing especially as Amy is notoriously disliked. Gerwig shot in film which was perfect for this period drama; It would have felt odd watching it any other way. During rehearsals Gerwig insisted the Actors bond through improvisations and sharing a home during filming. This preparation shows; Gerwig and the Actors capture a chaotic household of sisters perfectly; the squabbling, the talking over one another and the laughter. It's joyful to watch. Unlike other versions, Gerwig chose to skip back and forth through time. A brave choice to make but it works excellently by the use of clever editing, melding past and present together with different intent.  The costume design is breathtaking. The clothes are sumptuous making you want to reach into the screen and touch them. Standout performances from Timoth\u00e9e chalamet who plays Laurie and Florence Pugh playing Amy. Both effortless in their acting choices. Laura Dern (Marmee) is brilliant as always. I hope this picks up at least a couple of Academy awards this year.",

As expected, the whole cast is phenomenal, but Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet not only deliver the best performances of the film, but their characters carry the most compelling arcs. With so many people, it's remarkable the level of detail, complexity, and depth that each character has. However, some storylines are not as captivating as others, and the pacing suffers from these less exciting stories, which bring the movie down for some moments. The past-present transitions are mostly well-handled but a few are too confusing and abrupt. The contrasting tones of each timeline are consistent throughout the runtime, and the costume design steals the \"technical spotlight\". Overall, it's a pretty good romance, so if you enjoy the genre, I can't see why you shouldn't enjoy this one.\"",

This is a stunning film with effective pacing and an extraordinary cast.\n\nThe decision to tell the story of the March sisters in a nonlinear way creates emotional ebbs and flows that drive the plot flawlessly. The talent and chemistry of the entire cast blew me away. Florence Pugh and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet gave stand out performances as Amy and Laurie. Pugh's portrayal of Amy as a daydreaming, impetuous pre-teen who grows into an intelligent, passionate young woman is utterly charming. It's impossible not to get butterflies while Chalamet is on-screen. Even while portraying a stumbling drunk Laurie, he moves and speaks with elegance.\n\nAlthough I have not read Little Women since before I can remember, it is my understanding that Greta Gerwig did a great justice to the book, which is now on my re-read list. I am so grateful to be introduced to such strong and incredible women who are encouraged to be themselves and follow their hearts and minds on their own terms.",

Gerwig crafts her female characters in a way few writers can, and directs a film with cinematography reminiscent of Victorian-era paintings. The story has something new to say about being a woman in a man's world, the pains of growing up, and where we find true love. Not only this, but it does justice to Louisa May Alcott's story in a very (fascinatingly) meta style. This movie is engaging, insightful, well rounded, full of astounding performances/dialogue, and it is a film I will hold dear to my heart for a long time.",

The set and costume design was perfect.

However, sudden tonal shifts and time jumps made the movie somewhat confusing at times.\n\nLittle Women is great with its characters. All of the characters are distinct and are played by great actresses. As I mentioned above, Saoirse Ronan is a stand-out among the others and is one of my favorite performances of the year. Furthermore, the story handled emotion really well and made the movie interesting to watch. I enjoyed the use of period-accurate clothing and set pieces. Some of the shots in this movie were shot really nicely. Near the end of the movie, I started becoming more invested in the story and the characters. The final act is a wonderful piece of movie, I'd recommend it for this alone.\n\nWhile I enjoyed this movie, I did have quite a few issues. First off, the sudden tonal shifts felt abrupt at times. I mentioned above that this film handles emotion well. Still, it never seems like the movie can stick with a mood for more than a few minutes. There were also odd uses of time progression, often leaving me confused about when this was compared to other events. I haven't read the book, so, it's possible that some of this might have made more sense to others. While this isn't something that ruined the movie, I was also bothered by how much they complained about how poor they were while they were putting on fancy clothing. Most of my complaints are focused on the end of the first act and the start of the second. After that, I enjoyed it the whole way through.\n\nThat being said, I really enjoyed this movie overall. It tells a great story and is presented well for the most part. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has or has not read the book. It's an emotion-filled movie with great acting and a wonderful final act. I'm giving this movie a 3.5/5 because some of my complaints bugged me more than they should have. Still, it is a great movie, I would recommend it.",

They all look the same age when Amy should be 12 at the beginning of the story and Meg 16. The new \"twist\" on Amy, meh. She is a brat in the book because she's 12 and her actions are immature because of her age, nothing wrong with that. You see her mature and grow as a character, However Saoirse's Jo was amazing and Timothe as Laurie great casting, best chemistry from the entire cast (like in the book). Everyone else for me seemed forgettable. That's just my opinion not attacking anyone, but not my favorite film of the year or favorite adaption of the book.",

I want to see it again while it\u2019s still in theaters as well. I love the cast, which is crazy because films that have an all-star cast like this tend to suck even if the actors by themselves are good.

Sure Saoirse Ronan is great as always, and Laura Dern just won the Golden Globe for her supporting role...oh yeah, and...Hermyoney...was in the movie...too. But Pugh manages to turn the most objectively annoying character in the movie into a wonderfully complex study of sisterhood. If she were the only leg the movie had to stand on it would be entirely adequate. However director Greta Gerwig assembled an amazing cast including everyone's favorite twinkie emo boy Timothy Chalamet, and I couldn't believe I was looking at Bob Odenkirk from \"Mr. Show\" in a heartfelt Hollywood adaptation of a classic piece of semi-proto-feminist literature. It truly is the BerenstAin universe at this point.\n\nAfter turning out one of the finest movies of 2017, LADY BIRD, Gerwig had some great expectations to top it, and I can't say I'm terribly surprised to see she exceeded those expectations and decimated them. This is easily one of the most moving and universal stories put to screen this year. It kind of ticks me off that I have to wait months at a time to see something as good as this, and when it comes out there's about four or five other films released the same week that absolutely kick me in the gut. Movie distributors need to take a leaf from Gerwig and learn a better sense of pacing. I get pretty ticked off by time jumping narratives, but for some reason the way LITTLE WOMEN unfolds is so optimally timed and perfectly accents the juxtaposition of the girls' adolesence and their burgeoning adulthood. Now let's see if Gerwig can handle a STAR WARS spinoff or maybe a 7th phase Marvel movie. That'll be a true testament to her skills as a filmmaker.",

This ranks with Pride and Prejudice as the most endearing, and enduring, stories in literature. Jo Marsh and Elizabeth Bennet are definitely my two favorite characters.\n\nFlashback Score(0.5/1) An interesting, and new, way to tell the story. It was effective in Beths death scene was confusing at some other points.\n\nConquering Ourselves Score(20/20) The movie never shoves it in our face but its always there \u2013 the desire to become a better person. From the first Christmas, through Megs determination not to be poor(and to have a dress), and Jos desire to curb her temper, and Jos selling of her hair(and her Moms pride in her, and her later anguish) and the constant pointing out of flaws in Lauries character, the upward are is always on becoming our best self, on conquering our weaknesses.\n\nGods Will Score(20/20) Well, God hasnt met my will yet\u00a0 Jo thinks her passion will carry the day, that she can heal her sister with her fervor. And, yes, sometimes youll rush downstairs and find Beth and the kitchen table, but sometimes all youll find is your weeping mother. So what happens when our will meets Gods will. We bow. We can do nothing else.\n\nRelationship/Mise en Scene Score (30/30) The heart of the movie. Gerwig makes an interesting choice to reveal Jos rejection of Laurie early on. So there is no suspense about that relationship. This leaves us free to consider the question of fulfillment how do the characters conquer themselves?\u00a0 Meg finds that even a marriage relationship doesnt always satisfy, she still wants the pretty dress even at the expense of Johns coat. But she learns to take satisfaction in the relationship and to relinquish possession of the fabric.\n\nREPORT THIS AD\n\nBut Jo is at the center of the outworking of this question.\u00a0 In the central scene of the movie she rejects Lauries proposal. He goes and leaves her alone on a hillside. Alone except for the church in the distance and as she sits on the grass she places herself under the church.\u00a0 Because even in the absence of the human relationships we want there is a deeper yearning. Not just a will to which we can bow but a love in which we can immerse ourselves.\u00a0 It is this relationship which makes the quest to conquer ourselves not just a question of ethics but one of a perfecting love. We dont just strive to comply with an abstract set of norms, we strive to know and love the one who made us.\nJo beautifully expresses a tension in the film, Women have souls, and ideas, and they should be able to express them!\u00a0 But Im so lonely!\nThere is a relationship that encompasses both of these yearnings, that invites us to be all that we were created to be.\u00a0 But which still acknowledges that its not good to be alone. In their enjoyment of family and their yearning to conquer themselves and their(sometimes stiff-necked) bowing to Gods will Jo and Meg and Amy and Beth and Marmee and Laurie testify to the joy and sadness we all encounter on the journey to find our better selves.",

Despite all the plaudits, it felt to me like a pretty typical period melodrama. People argue over money, over love, over career choices or whatever else comes up. The dialogue is often frantic and spoken by many characters in close proximity, so I had trouble keeping up with a lot of what was happening, and the films insistence on constantly jumping back and forth between 2 times periods quickly became tiresome. Sometimes its hard to know which point in time we're supposed to be observing. It's completely unnecessary, and having the film take place in chronological order would have made the character development much more convincing, rather than having them abruptly shift from one emotional extreme to another. The acting is great, as you'd expect from this cast, though I was less impressed with Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet, who always seems to act like the spoiled, smug rich brat who nobody really wants to have around. His romances don't feel very convincing, partly because of the films spontaneous time jumps, and also because there doesn't seem to be much genuine emotion in their interactions. When he does get married it feels more like an obvious rebound than anything else. I suspect many will enjoy it more than I did, and while there was plenty to admire, I just wasn't taken with it.",

            "content": "From books to plays, to films, the Little Women story is one of those stories that just keeps getting updated, which isn't a bad thing, as long as they are doing it for a specific reason and not because they are out of ideas. Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\u00a0\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\u00a0\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\u00a0\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\u00a0\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.",

Rejigging the original tale and making it relevant, Gerwig's approach is handsome and smart. Whilst the film really only pulls together properly during the second half, nothing can be taken away from the cast and crew's efforts, with Ronan and Chamolet really shining. Laura Dern continues to prove David Lynch correct in saying she can do anything.  Probably most interesting about this adaption is how the sense of individuality all four girls have; nobody is sidelined or treated as an afterthought, and for the occasional frustration you feel, you never detach from the characters. Surprisingly snappy rendition of a classic for young girls to grow up with, and for boys to learn from.",

I have sadly never had the pleasure to read the novel but I definitely will after familiarising with this adorable story. The main characters are superbly portrayed by Saoirse, Timoth\u00e9e, Emma and Florence, and Alexandre Desplat's score gives the story the magic only he is able to convey. Gerwig's innovative adaptation seems more progressive and makes the sisters have a more modern and fresh feeling of freedom. It may well have a good chance of winning for Adapted Screenplay.

However, I've never read the source material, nor have I seen another version of this story. Therefore, I can only review this as I would any other film. Having said that, this is a well made film in all regards except the story. The characters are rushed in, to the point that almost 20 minutes into the film there's voice over that has to be accompanied with a quick shot of the actor just so you know who it is talking. You are asked to care about characters before you've really even memorized their names. There's way to much exposition. Motivations are obvious and carried through dialogue.   Character traits have to be visually portrayed with such means as having messy hair. I guess I could blame the source material but as an adaptation screenplay could things not have been done in the process of adapting it to make it better? Besides the storytelling problems the film is fine. I'm not sure why it was made if there are other versions of this same story. It's like Les Miserables, every time a studio wants a prestige film they just do another version of something most people could care less about and which by today's standards isn't very well written to begin with. My rating was the \"Meh, it passed the time\" rating...it fits. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't get a Best Picture nomination. There were more films by far more deserving. See it if you haven't seen any other version of \"Little Women...\" or don't. It's not really a good story to begin with.",

This film somehow felt incredibly indie to me, something I love seeing in these films, and I now completely understand the anger of her directing snub. The acting was outstanding, especially from Florence Pugh. To sum it up easier, I thought I'd be asleep in the first five minutes, but yet I was captivated the entire film.",

I was glad I saw it, and have recommended it to others, but I dont feel like Id bother watching this version again. It may prompt me to re-read it again...And I hope it gets others to eard it, as well as her other novels!\n      The scenery, settings, costuming were terrific. Aunt March perfectly acted! Laurie never did age. Prof Baer, although good eye candy, was too attractive-seemed too young for what I remember reading. The Pickwick Club scene was my Absolute Favorite!!!!! \n   So, a variety of how much I liked a variety of things. Ill quit here. Go see it. Enjoy it, and dont try to analyze like asked to do here!

All those beautiful settings, and every camera shot was a straight on shot.. like watching a play, instead of a beautiful period piece. I give it a solid meh.

            "content": "Adapting a book like \"Little Women\" which has been adapted to the screen so many times previously with the George Cukor version being possibly the best is a seemingly insurmountable task. Greta Gerwig seemed like the dream choice to serve as both writer and director of the film as she could inject her fresh, modern perspective and write dialogue that sounded quotidian. When the film's trailer was released I had immediate doubts as the spewing of feminist ideals with little consideration of the period the film is set in and Saoirse Ronan's odd accent put me on edge. In 2019 the film opened to rave reviews so I assumed that I would love it but I felt deflated and sad after watching the film as all the expectations I had for the film were not met.\n\nDuring the American Civil War in Concord, Massachusetts, the spirited and strong willed young writer Josephine March, Saoirse Ronan, struggles to express herself within a patriarchal society. She has an antagonistic relationship with her younger sister Amy, Florence Pugh, as March has more opportunities than Amy and the two both have a close bond with Theodore Laurence, Timothee Chalamet. March's older sister Meg, Emma Watson, is the most sensible member of the family and marries the poor but noble John Brooke, James Norton, but finds it difficult to let go of the pleasures that come with having money. Finally, the youngest sister Beth, Eliza Scanlen, dies of an illness that her sisters had tried to prevent by earning enough money to pay for expensive medical treatments. Years later Amy falls in love with Laurence while in Europe but still suffers from an inferiority complex in relation to her sister and feels that she is seen as second best. Meanwhile March writes her first book and develops feelings for the older teacher Friedrich Bhaer, Louis Garrel.\n\nOne of my issues with the story of Little Women is that I am inclined to dislike the main character with all of her haughtiness and supposed literary talent. It is hard for me to like her and I was overwhelmed with joy when the great Katharine Hepburn molded her into an immature, flawed young woman who still has a great zest for life and love for her sisters. In this film I found March intolerable as Ronan's portrayal wavered between second rate Hepburn impression and overly mannered but emotionally cold line delivery. There were points in the film where it seemed that she was just reciting her lines in a monotonous tone and at moments that should have been greatly impactful the audience has a muted response. Her scenes with Pugh in particular should have an undercurrent of hatred between two sisters who are rivals but Ronan will toss off lines that should be cutting in a casual tone and has that amused little half grin on her face. All of the elements of the character that I dislike are played up in this performance with March's arrogance and superiority being present throughout while her better qualities such as her passion for the arts not being projected as well by Ronan. \n\nAnother issue with the film is that while I did not want to be in the presence of March the rest of the characters in the film did not hold my interest. Amy is set up as the major supporting character and her conflict with her sister and romance with Laurence should be captivating and present us with a different perspective on womanhood. Unfortunately Amy is saddled with most of the feminist rhetoric and while I am a proud feminist myself I would like the theme of feminism to be presented in films without feeling that I am hit over the head with it. The scenes in which Amy expresses her opinions on the position of women in society felt preachy and lacked form as Pugh is left to angrily shout about her lack of financial means and dislike of the controlling men around her. I half expected her to start talking about \"intersectional feminism\" with how modern all of her speech was and I felt like I was watching a TED talk or listening to an article from Ms. Magazine read aloud. Gerwig did not fold the rhetoric about this important topic into the film successfully and that is a shame because it is rare that a film that centers female characters like this gets so much recognition. I would have preferred to see the sisters represent their feminism in more subtle ways and to have scenes devoted to the issue that feature dialogue that sounds natural and not overly written.",

My mom's first comment was \"well, that was a disappointment\" and that about sums it up. \n\nI love the book Little Women (although have always been partial to Little Men). And I'm always cautious about movies based on books, since they invariably do something that veers wildly from the expected plot. \n\nThis time, at least I went in knowing that that had been part of the point of this production (although I didn't know *how* until I saw it). \n\nI have four main problems with the movie. \n\n1. The time jumping was really hard to follow (minus the short period of time where Jo had short hair). I spent what felt like half the movie (or half of every scene) trying to figure out when it took place. \n\n2. Everyone looked the same the whole movie. No one aged. Even though it takes place over a course of 7 years. Seven years where Amy is now 20, which means the earliest scenes show her as 13. Show me one 20 year old who looked the exact same at 20. \n\n3. The end didn't make sense. Jo is stating one thing for her book, but possibly choosing a different tack in her life? Or is the movie we've been seeing actually supposed to be the book that she was writing? It's not clear. If she's writing their story, does she feel her character needs a different outcome than what she wants? And she and Frederik spent no time together. Their relationship was just odd. \n\n4. For some reason Gerwig decided to have Beth live much longer and in the end it made her death have a lot less impact on the story and characters. Which felt overly emphasized by the fact that once Amy finds out and is (supposedly) upset and grieving and in a rush to get home, what does she do instead? She gets married. \n\nFor bonus, randomly three characters speak directly to the camera at various points, for no reason. Breaking that fourth wall can be effective, IF THERE'S A REASON to. What the reason was here, I couldn't tell. \n\nAll of that said, sure, there was some good dialogue moments. And there was some good acting. But those don't fix what was a fundamentally a difficult movie to follow where the choices just felt like someone was reaching to try to make their version standout and be \"artsy\" and less about telling the coherent solid story the book tells.",

            "content": "\"Adorable women\" Greta's new film is an epic epic, beautiful and playful that despite many setbacks and casualties always tries to keep up with hope and passion.\n\nThe script, which is based on a book that has already had other adaptations for the cinema tells the story of a quartet of sisters, their loves, difficulties and disagreements, never hiding the tragedy but always looking for the happy part, Greta introduces us the film with a sentence saying that it tells happy stories because it has lived many sad times, and that is a perfect allegory to the film and the metalanguage produced by him in the figure of the book of Job.\n\nEach sister has her own personality that is intertwined between them, J\u00f4 is the sister who seeks independence and the different, the sister who does not accept the status of the situation and wants to change constantly, extroverted and charismatic the actress who lives J\u00f4 incorporates her character and gives a show apart, the young actress is the beating heart of the film, contrary to what J\u00f4 represents we have Amy, the most spoiled of sisters, who dreams and preaches the pattern, getting married and living a beautiful and artistic life, lived by florence who makes a wonderful performance, incorporating all the perks that her Amy lives for, plus a great performance for the young actress, we also have Meg who dreams of love and starting a family, lived by Emma Watson who is very well in the feature , and finally we have Beth, the youngest and most innocent of the sisters, and in turn the most perfect for not containing the evil and malice of the others.\n\nGreta directs her film very smoothly, counting on an incredible artistic direction, with great hair, makeup, great costumes, her great direction is even a little lost among all this production, another highlight is also the great soundtrack and magnificent photography, which mixes different shades of colors between the narrative lines and the mood of the feature, these changes are small, but they are able to situate the viewer very well.\n\n\"Adorable women\" It's a great film, a shame that came out in a year of so many great films, which ends up somewhat obscuring its prominence, but we have great performances and a beautiful story, we left the cinema happy and satisfied, knowing that we saw something pleasant, touching, an allegory to life very well acted and directed, with a beautiful artistic production.

Lady Bird was at least 5 times better than this peace of crap. If Greta Gerwig can make Lady Bird decent then make this a drunken mess, she deserves no reward. There were only a handful a scenes that I paid attention to, the rest sucked. I would have walked out of the theater but I wanted to see how it ended and I was disappointed. I passed time on my phone cause I was the only one in the theater. Stay away from this movie, I would only recommend it to seniors over 65.",

The linear narrative of the original story benefited little from the many flashbacks used to contrast the happy adolescences of the March sisters, to the more bleak early adulthood. Gerwig missed the opportunity to develop a more convincing relationship between Jo and Laurie as she quickly established that they were friends, and nothing else. It is obvious that the chemistry between both the actors exists, as evident in their wonderful partnership in Ladybird, but this previous success was too heavily leaned upon and fell flat. Yet, Gerwig had done a wonderful job in developing Amy, giving a more humanised depiction of her to which I enjoyed. Overall, this film has heart, the acting from the cast was fantastic and is an enjoyable watch, but can come off as confusing and rushed at times.",

Timothee as Laurie and Saoirse as Josephine were absolutely wonderful, however the actress chosen for Amy came off much older and more mature than the lines she was being told to say, and it didn't feel cohesive to me. I also felt that Emma Watson's character as Meg wasn't given enough lines or screen-time to feel well-rounded, and the director's choice to go back and forth in time makes her come off instead just a bit materialistic without it making sense as to why. So little things like this took away from the believable charm and connection of the 1994 sisterhood.",

The cinematography was entrancing and I loved how I felt like I could emphasize with the female leads. I think it truly brought to light many factors that I missed in the earlier movies, such as Amy's struggles and a further study of Jo's character. It did, at times, feel slightly rushed- but overall it was cohesive, largely owing to its familiarity. I want to see more movies like this, that lift me up and inspire me to do my best. Movies that give me, a seventeen-year-old girl, some semblance of hope in a world where fire drills can mean a school shooting and the statue of liberty no longer stands for equal opportunity. I appreciate the work and dedication that went into this production, from the ensnaring costuming to the delicate dialogue that simultaneously tore my heart in two and put it back together again. I come from a large family, so the ideals of hope, happiness, and support resonated with me and inspired me to try my best, even when I feel lost, to find joy and make the best of the world. To be strong and brave and to follow my passions. To adhere to my principles, to learn from my mistakes. It may sound flowery and verbose, and I doubt anyone will read this- or even care- but I felt an unrelenting need to share my thoughts. I want to thank the actors, in particular, the March sisters, for giving me this. \nI'm the oldest child in my family and I always aspired to be like Meg. But to see her struggle and her flaws and watch her and her sisters' journey through all that was so much more impactful. To witness lines such as the opening scene of the novel, directed in such a way that it did not feel like 'the perfect model family', sitting beside the fire and bettering themselves of their flaws in a way I could never hope to match- it felt like watching me and my sisters, while we tried to come to terms with not having as many presents as we would like on Christmas, though we all knew we were lucky to have anything at all. It felt like my family when I watched the March sisters tumbling on the floor and laughing and talking over one another. It felt like home. The story of this family has given me so much hope throughout my childhood, but this rendition surpassed anything I've gained before. I just wanted to say that, to anyone looking for light in the dark, I would suggest this. It is by no means a perfect film. But I think it is made better by its flaws. \nI've been away from my family for a long time, and when I miss them, I try to reflect on the time spent together. I try to enjoy the times when we are all together. And this movie encompasses that. It's a bildungsroman so similar to my own situation that I cannot help but feel like it's my lifeline. And perhaps this is just me. But I hope that this review will tell those who worked so hard to create this that it was not for naught. You've helped me.",

No way could anyone be prettier than Elizabeth Taylor in the 1949 version or Katherine Hepburn's strong, steadfast as Jo in the 1933 version or the realistic Jo of Winona Ryder in the 1994 film. After twenty minutes I was confused because the women we are seeing aren't 'little women', they are grown women.\n\nThis is the only way that the director/screenwriter Greta Gerwig missteps in both categories because at times it becomes confusing at moments--important moments, otherwise she has kept everything under control from the perfect cast to keeping all important parts of the book.\n\nMost people reading this are familiar with \"Little Women\" either from previous movie versions or actually reading the classic book and if you aren't I don't want to spoil any of the film so on to the cast.\n\nSaoirse Ronan, as Jo, projects a strong women of yesteryear and today and has scored her 4th Oscar nomination. Emma Watson as Meg, Eliza Scanlen as Beth and Florence Pugh, who won a best Oscar supporting actress nomination interact as sisters do while Laura Dern as their mother is warm, stern and her own woman. Meryl Streep is playing Maggie Smith's role from \"Downton Abbey\"!\n\nMost of the men, except Timothee Chalamet who plays Laurie, and is prettier than Elizabeth Taylor or anyone in this film, captures the audience in a heartbreaking scene with Jo. Louis Garrel as a language professor in a few short scenes shows he can stand up to whatever is thrown at him. Chris Cooper, as Laurie's, grandfather, opens himself gradually until we get to know this intensely private human scene and Tracy Letts as Jo's first publisher  and James Norton as Meg's husband support the women. \n\n\"Little Women\" will take hold of you about 30 minutes into the film and hold on to you for the next 105 minutes.",

It is heartwarming and has great storytelling in the screenplay, adapted from the Louisa May Alcott book by director Greta Gerwig. I liked this take on the classic book made into a movie. All the scenes were so true to the time period and shot beautifully. The bond between the sisters seems genuine and deep.\n\nDuring the Civil War, many husbands and young men go off to war, leaving their loved ones to struggle to survive. Scarlet fever is killing people rapidly. It seems people are either really wealthy or really poor. This family in the film comprises the mother and four sisters who are the \"Little Women.\" They love, play, laugh and grow together. They deal with starvation, illness and love.  They pull together to help their neighbors in time of need.  You see the challenges they face of this time period, and they question the way things have been, facing issues such as marrying to help their family or marrying for love. Or whether to pursue a career or not. \n\nThis film really takes us back to this time period, and we are able to get an understanding of the struggles of young women of those days. At first I didn't catch that the film was moving from past to present. The time switches made it a little hard for me to follow, but that did keep my attention as did the sets and costumes.\n\nThe actors did phenomenal work in their roles. I really felt the civil rivalry, love and bond between the siblings.  The main character in this film is the oldest sister, Jo March (Saoirse Ronan). She aspires to help her family and to be a writer, so she writes stories and submits them to a paper. She was great to watch in this role. The other sisters are Meg March (Emma Watson), Amy March (Florence Pugh), who loves to paint and draw and who looks up to her sister Jo, and Beth March (Eliza Scanlen). Aunt March (Meryl Streep) is a well-to-do, snooty widow. She is really funny, annoying and uses her money to her advantage.  \n\nMy favorite part of Little Women is when the man that works at the paper company wants Jo's book. He thinks he is smarter than she. \n\nLittle Women is about young sisters growing up, facing life challenges, making mistakes and forgiving.  It really is good for all young ladies and women to see this film.\n\n\nI give this movie a 5 out of 5 stars rating and recommend this movie for ages 12 to 18. Reviewed by Ivey H., KIDS FIRST!

The biggest difference between the two films, and honestly it made Greta Gerwig\u2019s special, was making the decision to tell the story in a non linear style. Jumping from the present to the past, successfully pairing the two.  Something as simple as Jo burning her dress in one scene in present time and then jumping to the past having her dress burned right before she meets Laurie. A touching pairing (spoiler) was when Jo nurses Beth back to health after getting Scarlet fever, juxtaposed with Jo\u2019s attempt to nurse Beth one last time and failing. There isn\u2019t a major attempt to show physical changes since both time lines are only 7 years apart so the director uses a summer hue for the past and a gray/blue winter tone for the present. This makes it real easy to follow. Another important factor is that they introduce a character like Friedrich earlier, so we aren\u2019t left wondering why Jo ends up with a character that shows up in the second half of the story. There\u2019s more to talk about but this is running a little long. This film is playing at Maya, and Edwards, take your daughters. It\u2019s worth watching.",

To start, the back-and-forth from present to future... whhyyy??!! It was completely unnecessary, and what made it difficult to tell which time I was in was that the actresses all looked around the same age throughout. I thought Saoirse did an ok job, my mom (who I watched the film with) said she \u201coveracted\u201d lol. The kid who plays Laurie is good but he never aged in the future either, I\u2019m not even sure he can grow facial hair. And Bob Odenkirk? Seriously? I\u2019m a huge fan of Bob but he in no way belonged in this movie, especially in that role. I\u2019m also a huge Laura Dern fan but she was my first disappointment on the screen. Her acting was just subpar, I don\u2019t know what the hell happened here with her. Meryl Streep was amazing, as usual. It did occur to me that Susan Sarandon probably could\u2019ve played Aunt March, or even Marmee again now that I think of it. I don\u2019t know, it was a casting nightmare with a big budget. It seemed like Greta put in her indie favorites and threw in whatever a-listers she could get whether they were right for the role or not. Wait for streaming or redbox.",

Starting in future and jumping back to the past then jumping to the future??? It ruins the whole emersive experience that the true Little Women story provides.\n\nThe reason that the story has attracted so many young girls is because that's when the story starts, when they are little girls and draws you in as they grow, learn and mature.\n\nNext, the dreadful casting of characters that do not capture the true essence of the sisters! The terrible idea to have younger Amy and older Amy played by the same actress makes the younger Amy extremely unlikeable. And although I am a fan of Saoirse Ronan, her portrayal of Jo was completely inadequate, scatter-brained and weak.\n\nThe others so blended into the scenery they're not even worth critiquing with one exception. The one star was given for Meryl Streep.\n\nEven if I could get behind the chaotic way in which the story was told and the drab choice of actors and actresses, I absolutely draw the line at Greta Gerwig's choice to merge the life of Louisa May Alcott and the character Jo March!\nThis is where the chunk of my feeling of betrayal comes from. If Greta wished to make that creative choice she has all right to do so but then Greta Gerwig cannot call this movie Little Women! Because it is not!!\n\nGreta has 'adapted' the original story to the point where the story has shifted perspective from the central theme being family to it being about women's rights.\n\nIf this is the story Greta wanted to tell then she should have done a biographical movie about Louisa May Alcott without riding on the coat tails of Little Women!!!\n\nGreta Gerwig's explanation that she used materials from letters and diaries of Louisa May Alcott is just insulting. It's all the more reason that it should have been a biographical movie of Alcott's life.\n\nCritics and Reviewers are commenting on what a wonderful movie this is, and it may be in its own right, with important themes being represented, but it is not LITTLE WOMEN and should not be misrepresented as such!!!",

Gerwig's adaptation is faithful, and brings with it a strong knowledge of film grammar, a logic different from chronological literary narrative, to create a film experience that is a cognitive as well as a visual treat. While details of production design, costuming and music are all close to perfection, it is the work of the central performers that impresses the most. If we can say it is a film where Streep's performance is the closest to caricature of all, we merely point out how stunning the women, most notably Saoirse Ronan, in fact are. The work of Dern and the actors portraying her daughters, is subtle and nuanced where the great work of Zellweger ('Judy') is conscious and hammy. There's no sense of 'look at me, I'm acting'. Their world becomes our world. The narrative is true to emotion and the human condition, and has a validity that makes it more universal than the more male-centred cinema dominating awards conversations. This adaptation, this film, will, I think, outlive those ephemeral award winners.",

I was a little bit confused on why Emma Watson still had her British accent even though the movie takes place in Massachusetts but besides this I would highly highly recommend this movie to anyone.  I wanted to see this before the Oscar nominations but even though I didn't get a chance to do that, I still think it deserves all of the nominations it got and that Greta Gerwig should have also gotten a Best Director nomination as well.",

This movie feels like that special piece of art.

            "content": "Greta Gerwig's \"Little Women\" is a smart, heartwarming and moving adaptation of the beloved literary classic. With her latest feature, writer/director Greta Gerwig has crafted an astonishing adaptation of a beloved book. Using a finely tuned script and excellent ensemble cast, Gerwig captures the essence of Louisa Mary Alcott's timeless story. It is the director's first stab at creating a period piece set in the 1800's, but she pulls it off effortlessly. Through gorgeous production design, Gerwig draws viewers into the lives of the March sisters. The sets, costumes and musical score are pitch-perfect, capturing the time period accurately. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is at the top of its game. Saoirse Ronan delivers her finest performance to date as Jo March. Strong, charming and resilient, she captures the free spirit of the iconic character. The supporting cast, which includes the fantastic Florence Pugh, is also worthy of recognition. Although \"Little Women\" is incredibly well-made, ultimately it is not a film without flaws. At nearly two and a half hours, it is slightly long and suffers from a lengthy running-time. Moreover, it's non-linear narrative has sudden time jumps that may be confusing for viewers that haven't read the book. Nevertheless, fans of the beloved book will definitely enjoy \"Little Women\" and so will movie-goers seeking heartwarming entertainment. At a time when female-led films are a rarity in Hollywood, it's reassuring to be reminded that movies like \"Little Women\" are still getting made.",

But from the start it is certainly a delight, it's very charming and crafted with extreme care. You could wonder if we really do need another remake of Little Women as the much loved novel has been adapted many times. And quite possibly we honestly don't need another one. But this film is so well directed and written and acted that I am very happy that it exists. Plus I have never read the book or seen previous film versions so for me it was a fresh slate. For those that don't know the film is set in late 19th century Massachusetts. Told in two parts, the first part deals with the March family. Primarily a mother and her four daughters as the father is away fighting in the Civil War. They are not well to do and we meet four women of totally different personalities who have dreams of a larger life. The most prominent daughter being Jo, who wants to be a writer. The second part takes place 7 years later as we see how life has treated the family. Some good, some bad. The unique part of this film is that the two sections are not handled chronologically. We jump back and forth in the timeline. It's a fresh approach and I think adds extra weight to the drama. In just her second film Greta Gerwig shows she is a film maker of remarkable talent. She frames the film beautifully and the writing is spot on. Production design is exemplary too and the film truly glows with a wonderful spirit and charm. Plus the topic of women trying to make a mark in the world is more relevant than ever. The struggles they face is still certainly timely. This is especially the case in the free spirit of Jo, the true centre of the film. She is played by the superb Saoirse Ronan, surely one of the greatest acting talents of this era. Also wonderful are Florence Pugh and Timothee Chalamet who also shine in their roles. This is a film to enjoy on many levels. It's a joy to watch but it also has sad moments and moments of good humour. A film that is good for the head and the heart.",

            "content": "When I think of Katharine Hepburn's Jo, in George Cukor's delectable \"Little Women\" of 1933, what I remember is not her chatter, as raucous as a raven, but her impromptu fencing match in a drawing room, or the galumphing (moving in a clumsy, ponderous, or noisy manner; inelegant) rumpus she makes when, at her mother's call, she clatters down the stairs.\n\nRonan is less loud than Hepburn, but she has inherited some of her hustle and bustle, and anyone who admired Ronan in the title role of Gerwig's \"Lady Bird\" (2017) will note a similar fixity of purpose in her portrayal of Jo. Katharine Hepburn is a very hard act to follow but Ronan exudes the role brilliantly.\n\nIn the latest film, Amy is played by Florence Pugh, whose star, from \"Lady Macbeth\" (2016) to \"Midsommar\" (2019), has continued to rocket. (Next spring, she will battle through \"Black Widow,\" as Scarlett Johansson's sister. A slight change of tone from the Marches.) Pugh is twenty-three but seems older, with her frightening poise and the pass-me-a-smoke throatiness of her voice, and while the innocence of Amy, equipped with long blond braids, is a stretch for her, the willful tenacity presents no problem. Florence Pugh's Oscar-nominated portrayal of Amy March was a stand-out. Her performance is tremendous.\n\nThe other actors who complete the March quartet--Emma Watson as Meg, and Eliza Scanlen as the vulnerable Beth are perfectly cast. Both were women are superb in their roles.\n\nLaura Dern, who plays Marmee and Meryl Streep as Aunt March, Laurie (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet),and his sad grandfather (Chris Cooper), Professor Bhaer (Louis Garrel) round out the notable ensemble.\n\nGerwig's adaptation is not chronological: to and fro she darts across the years, chopping the plot into flashbacks and flash-forwards, and keeping us on our toes. Gerwig isn't afraid to let her audience work a little. She trusts our intelligence and our curiosity, and also her own command of the medium. It kept the story fresh and I applaud her storytelling. Brava Greta !\n\nLittle Women is made with so much heart, love and enthusiasm both behind and in front of the camera that even the deeply sad scenes still fill you with joy and longing. It's an explosion of emotions, from loss to love to everything in between. Gerwig's smart, delightful film seems on its way to becoming a classic.\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig Writers: Greta Gerwig, Louisa May Alcott (based on the novel by) Starring: Abby Quinn, Bob Odenkirk, Chris Cooper, Eliza Scanlen, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, James Norton, Jayne Houdyshell, Laura Dern, Louis Garrel, Meryl Streep, Saoirse Ronan, Timoth, Tracy Letts 10/10\n Nominated for six Academy Awards including best picture.",

This is a sumptuously designed, beautiful-looking saga of love, possibility and the yearning for what could have been, featuring some standout performances from nearly every cast member (though high praise goes to Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh and Timothee Chalamet, in particular) and a truly winsome screenplay and vision from Gerwig herself. Tender, yet pleasant, sad, but still joyous, and challenging and crowd-pleasing all at once, this is most definitely one of the best of the calendar year that was 2019, and yet another reason why Greta Gerwig is one to look out for in terms of burgeoning filmic talents.",

The new 2019 one that's in theaters...well let me tell you. We have the character Amy being played by a TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD ACTRESS....where in the book and 1994 version she is supposed to be TWELVE YEARS OLD. HOW DOES SOMEONE LOOK PAST THAT. I literally was sitting there laughing at this 24 year old women on the big screen, talk and act like a 12 year old little girl, it was absolutely ridiculous and ruined her character completely! Made me so angry.   Also, how in the world did this actor who played Laurie get the role? He literally looks like a 16 year old little boy. Horrible casting choice. Beth also doesn't have enough screen time in the movie to be the deeply spiritual and loving person she is in the house that she is in the 1994 movie and book. I didn't even cry when certain scenes with her happened. THAT SAYS A LOT. I brought Kleenex to the movies...for nothing. All four girls HAVE DIFFERENT HAIR COLOR. Did \"Marmee\" sleep with four different men? Like, at least make them all look alike. Beth had flaming red hair, Meg had dark brown almost black hair, Jo had dirty blonde and Amy was blonde...like really? Also, Orchard House (where they live) is also missing some meaning that was really profound in the book and 1994 version of the movie. All the girls look the exact same age which they're obviously not supposed to be, everything seemed to be so rushed. Some iconic lines that we're supposed to hear, are meshed with everyone else trying to talk at the same time. \"Marmee\" didn't seem like the caring, compassionate and devoted mother she is in the 1994 version aswell. So disappointing. The ONLY thing I like, was that they added a few more scenes in this movie that were actually in the book. Anyway, rant over",

I went in to this picture so excited and ready to love it. Sadly, I was ready to walk out within the first 10 minutes.

The editing of the movie is very well done, it is an edition that holds the viewer in the story. Saoirse Ronan is amazing in this movie, it's a fantastic performance, a well deserved Oscar nomination. Florence Pugh is doing very well too. The other secondary performances are decent: Emma Watson, Eliza Scanley, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Laura Dern, Maryl Streep, Bob Odenkirk.

It was a more interesting presentation of this well-trod tale, rather than just telling it in a linear fashion. Lots of other good things about it, too. But,\u00a0I spent the first half of the film sulking a bit, realizing that I'm probably prejudiced against the source material. American literature from the 19th century, be it Alcott, Twain, Hawthorne, or any of their lot, has always been my least favorite genre, even though the single best teacher I've ever had was for junior year high school English which was American literature and while she set me on the path of thinking critically and expressing myself with words, even she couldn't get me to love most classic American novels.

The film tells a very relevant story of the changing roles for women during the 1800s but at its core it is a very personal story of Louisa May Alcott, her sisters and her family. History in the movies is still too often understood from the male perspective - famous generals, battles, heroes of warfare. Little Women tells the other story. This is a terrific film.  Go see it.",

            "content": "I'll try to keep this vague so as to not spoil it too badly for those unfamiliar with the story. I love the book Little Women and have mostly enjoyed film adaptations of it. This adaptation was both unneccessary and disappointing. It seems like a vanity project. The acting was good, as was the look of the film, but the so much of the story's charm was lost by the flashback nature of the narrative. Even for someone familiar with the story, it was hard to follow and frustrating. I left the theatre very upset by what had been done to a beloved story. The only thing I really liked was that Amy's romance, which always seems like an afterthought, got a great deal of focus. Beyond that, it was painful. Meg's romance seemed one-dimensional and Jo's romance was rendered practically ridiculous. The flashbacks made it hard to tell, but she seemed to barely speak to her love interest before reaching an absolutely horrendous scene (it made me cringe) where everyone told her she loved him and then she chased him down at the train station. The character of Jo was further diminished by the way she dealt with her loneliness at one point. I also felt that Laurie's grandfather was misrepresented as if he had been sitting at home waiting to be invited to join in the jolly antics next door. His character, although more of a background character, has a more complex journey than that. To me the absolute travesty of this film was the casting of the actor to play Laurie (aka Teddy). This was a huge mistep. I didn't like him from the start, but could accept him when Laurie was a teen, but when Laurie was a grown man in his mid-twenties, both when living wildly and when taking responsibility, it was abasolutely impossible to take his character seriously when he still looked 13. I'm not sure that there are enough words to decribe how much I disliked this adaptation of Little Women.",

The beauty of the story is that the feminist narrative is natural, and is evident through plot and character but Gerwig is more concerned with over the top speeches and declarations. Anyone who has read and loved Alcott's novel should be severely disappointed with the very shallow character development, and confusing stop-start storyline. Despite the star studded cast, a number of whom I think are brilliantly talented in other movies, not a single actor impressed me in this. Saoirse Ronan was tolerable, but chalamet was a disaster, as was Pugh and *gulp* even meryl Streep. After the Winona Ryder/Christian bale version this was an unwatchable let down.",

            "content": "Enjoyed it but did not love it. Felt some of characters were miscast. Actor  playing Lorie looked too young for the part. He did not look like a romantic suitor for Jo. There was no real chemistry with him and Amy either. Relationship with Any was not developed enough to suddenly blossom into a romantic one.   Actress playing Amy looked too old to play Amy when a child. . Especially with that deep mature voice. Even actress playing Beth did not encompass the shy introverted Beth in the book. As much as I very much like the actress playing Meg, she did not come off as the older, more mature sister. In fact they all seemed to be the same age. Also did not love the new twist that Meg as a Mother is not happy with her less than easy life with her husband due to finances.  It seemed mismatched with who Meg was and the expectation of women in the day. \n\nAlso felt the movie was disjointed and more difficult to follow since the director kept moving between the women as adults and then flashing back as younger girls. They always looked the same age. At times hair style or length of hair was the only way to be sure what year the scene took place. There was not enough to delineate time periods. For younger audiences especially it could be hard to follow. \n\nFelt Jos relationship with the professor is not clear at the end due to her discussion with the publisher regarding the ending of the book she wrote. At one point she says Jos heroine does not marry Lorie or the Professor at the end of her somewhat autobiographical book because her heroine  kept saying she would never marry. In fact, Jo said the same through out the movie. Yet, we are lead to believe she ends up with the professor. This was a scene the director added, but I felt it did not imply what the director hoped it would that Jo did not allow her heroine to cave to the mores of the day where women were meant to marry. In reality, Louise May Alcott never did marry. It might have made sense if her Little Women ended with Jo single as the author was, but in the movie it did not make sense to try to support this singles lifestyle when in fact Jo ends up with the professor or so we are lead to believe.  It was confusing.\n\nIn general, when dealing with a classic it is difficult to make changes that do not fit with the basis of the original or the time period it was written. To modernize it changes the story. Jo does not think she will ever marry not because she is pushing a feminism viewpoint  but rather more because she feels introducing others to the family, namely spouses, threatens the closeness she has with her sisters and family. She fears losing these people she feels so much for.  She wants to hold on to what she knows and does not want change. As she matures into an adult and expands her world and experiences true love, she realizes she will never lose the love or relationships she has with her family and in fact adding others to the family only enriches it and life.  \nThis is the basis of the book to me. It is about family, relationships and growing up. It really was not about womens rights. I understand why the director chose in this day and age to update the story line to address the suppression of women, and normally I might agree it was a clever addition. But in this case, I feel it clouds the point of the book and changes a classic read.",

            "content": "While the story is not preachy, this is a scathing indictment of American maltreatment of women around the Civil War. But the story is much richer than that, posing a tapestry of American life, of families, siblings (both love and rivalry), of love and war, of rich and poor, of sense and sensibility, of darn near everything. Alcott and Gerwig have a real American masterpiece here, and the superb acting includes Saoirse, Dern, Pugh, Chalamet, Cooper, Watson, Letts and Streep. It's even set in Concord, Mass., to emphasize it is a bigger American story than four girls growing up -- yes, that Corncord, which with Lexington are in the history books as the flashpoint that started our 18th-century revolution. Even the title is  based on an affectionate name a father at war has for his four daughters, Little Women. But it also means an American era in which all Women were of Little value -- no vote, no property, no rights over their own children, few jobs, etc. It was actually breathtaking how much the central character, Jo, was taken by the throat by Saoirse and dominated the whole movie, not by force, but by her personality, spunkiness, humanity and determination -- and willingness to suffer for the path she chose, while vulnerable to struggle with romance and loneliness, too. Bravo. If not the  best movie of the year, it's darn close. And the love for offspring and people embodied by Laura was palpable, even visceral. I happened upon the 1995 version on TV, and while the cast was impressive as Winona Ryder was Jo, Susan Sarandon was Marmie, Christian Bale was Laurie, Eric Stoltz was the penniless teacher who married Meg, Trini Alvarado, Claire Danes was the pitiful Beth whose music could not keep her alive, and Amy was played young and old by Kirsten Dunst and  Samantha Mathis, and Gabriel Byrne played Jo's final love interest as a German prof, not French, I'm afraid it can't hold a candle to this one. Saoirse as Jo represents a kind of every American girl who longs and works to become an everywoman who charts her own course based on her aptitude, ability and skill and is not hampered by an oppressive society and culture that trivializes, even infantalizes, women. It's a hundred years since women got the vote, but I think that they'd tell you today that while they've come a long way, baby, they haven't come all the way, even in 2020, making this story not just relevant but also timely, though set 160 years ago.",

            "content": "Greta Gerwig's take on Louisa May Alcott's classic book is a beautiful heart-warming tale about Jo March's ambition to become a published author, but also about the domestic lives of herself and those close to her. \n\nThe screenplay for this film is incredibly well written by Greta Gerwig, with the concept of having a non-chronological storyline really blooming for the promise of the themes and storylines in this film. An example of this was Amy's chat with Laurie about why she's giving up art was directly followed up with her talk with Aunt March years earlier about how she is the only hope left to be the economic back bone of her family, a true stroke of genius from Gerwig. However, during the film it did at times become unclear as to whether the scene is taking place before or after the last scene and roughly how long before or after which makes you think about how the story is working rather than letting yourself delve into the blissful world of the story.\n\nAs with great direction, comes great editing. Nick Houy does an excellent job assisting Gerwig in letting the different complex emotions and atmospheres of the scenes seemingly flow into another. However there were moments of sloppiness. In the first Christmas breakfast scene there is an abrupt change in atmosphere and the audience can tell two shots were acquired from different takes, rather than making it seem like it was one take, which often isn't the case in cinema, but is the goal to edit it to make it look like it is. Though that could be claimed as nit picking, as it is really, however the scene between Amy and Laurie where Laurie is wearing a green scarf is anything but. His scarf seems to magically change knots when the camera goes back to him. This lack of care to detail in continuity by both Houy and Chalamet takes you out of otherwise a beautiful scene.\n\nAlexandre Desplat does an incredible job of creating a beautiful score that perfectly weaves into the scene it's used in and it accentuates atmospheres/emotions in a scene, or in the case of the two Beth Christmas breakfast scenes, harsh contrast to really get the most out of the performances given by the cast. Yorick Le Saux does a sublime of capturing the action between the frame lines, with each image of the countryside looking blissful, the use of vibrant colours contrasting with dull colour palates also beautifully creates the atmosphere, credit here also goes to Nick Houy and the set designer, Jess Gonchor, who created incredible locations for the shoot making it seem like we were actually in the 19th century.\n\nThe acting in this film was overall really solid, with Meryl Streep (Aunt March) putting in a good performance as you expect of her to do. Saoirse Ronan (Jo March) puts in a flawless performance creating a person of flesh and blood that the audience can invest into. An actress that may get looked over in this film is Laura Hern (Marmee March) who also puts in an incredible performance as a caring mother who has to paint herself as braver and better than she is for her children. Emma Watson (Meg March) also puts in a really good performance in this film, creating some beautifully heart-warming, and sometimes heart-breaking scenes with her incredible nuanced work with James Norton (John Brooke).\n\nOverall, Gerwig's take on 'Little Women' is a tale of female identity and how companionship is a help to us rather than a hinderance as it may seem. This film will make you laugh with the characters and cry for them, this is easily the best film released at Christmas time within the last decade.",

In the end, while I really enjoy a lot of the cast and aspects of Gerwigs version, I didn't feel like I wanted to re-watch it again and again. \n\nAmy's scenes stole the show, as did Aunt March (I mean, c'mon. It's Meryl). As great as Saoirse Ronan was as Jo, Amy's character was just a lot more dynamic and surprising in this version. Chalamet measured up very well to Christian Bale's performance. Laura Dern as Marmee was a big misfire. She was too bubbly compared to the serious-natured and wise Marmee from the book. Beth's drawn out death/memory scenes were a little watered down. There was no tear-jerking speech goodbye from her.  And Poor Emma Watson really got the shaft. Meg was so bland and forgettable.  \n\nFinally, Bob Odenkirk as papa.... it was a distraction. When he came on the screen, is when I finally told myself this version just isn't as good.  That said, worth watching, but I doubt I'll see it again.",

The script felt quick and lively and held attention throughout, its been 30 years since I've read the novel and yet I still felt like it was a story I'd never heard because the acting and characters were so compelling they drew me into the world onscreen. Can't recommend enough, and bonus points for bringing some male company with you! This is a universal love story about family and independence, it deserves to be seen by all.",

It keeps skipping back and forth, randomly, between different years in the girls lives. So its very confusing and doesnt tell a logically connected story. if movies were still shown on reels of film, I would say that the reels been totally mixed up in the order they were shown.  I dont know if this was the directors vision for the film or just bad editing. It really was a total waste of the talents of some very fine actresses.",

Amy especially is supposed to be such a young child! Also, the constant flashing back and forth damaged the potency and power of Alcott's narrative and was at times confusing. Not to mention the ending, which was cheesier than I felt it should be. Additionally I found the random direct talking to the camera towards the end to be distracting and inconsistent - it felt like an amateur, unnecessary move.

I love the opening shot of the main character standing outside the room that holds her future and then at the end of the movie she is standing outside the same room with that feeling of success. As far as the scenes were shot in the past they were very fast and it was completely appropriate for the tone of the past but in the present the characters are more slow and sad. Because of the characters sorrows the shots were more long and dragged out. I thought this was the perfect way to capture the True Tone of the past and present.

It made no sense because John Brooke is in the film a ton and they discuss him a ton, but never show their romance in any way.\nBeth: I didn't even get choked up when she died because they don't portray her as a painfully shy and compassionate, so she's got no character traits and is utterly forgettable.\nAmy: Horrible casting. She's a full grown woman with a super deep voice playing a 12 year old. She also conveys zero emotion in her scenes, despite getting a huge chunk of the movie dedicated to her. She also seems to lack any traits other than \"artist\".\nLaurie: Timothee Chalamet is probably the best Laurie I've seen despite the terrible screenplay. He definitely shows what a philanderer Laurie is. Unfortunately, it starts in the second scene before we even have a chance to fall in love with the character. Also, it's hard to believe he is madly in love with Jo when all of his scenes are pretty much with Amy. Jo and Laurie seem like barely more than acquaintances.\nFrederich Behr: Dude doesn't say anything the whole movie except that he doesn't like Jo's writing and then somehow Jo is magically in love with him.\nMarmie: Has almost no scenes and doesn't come off as having any notable characteristics. She sobs after Beth dies but they mute it and cue the music, thus effectively destroying the one chance Laura Dern has to convey emotion.\nAunt March: Meryl Streep stole the show in her 4 scenes. Well done. She manages to show the character's personality and motives with just a few minutes of screentime.\nGrandpa Lawrence: This guy should have had way more screen time, he did a great job.\nMr. March: I don't even know why they bothered putting him in the movie.\n\nAnd there you have it... The character driven movie's terrible character development and character relationships. How is this getting rave reviews? Watch the 1994 version. It's amazing.",

Instead of the main focus being the 4 sisters, we have the journey of Jo March to ultimately writing this story and truly being herself. I appreciate how each sister gets a moment of focus, almost like their own chapter of the story. \n\nThe way this is played, you really do see the growth of everyone's characters. I appreciate how the relationships all make sense and characters like Meg March are much clearer and well-formed in the story. Florence Pugh does an exceptional job of taking one of the most controversial characters in literature, Amy March, and making her much more three-dimensional and understood. There are some things that are inescapable, but at least I don't leave despising Amy (like I usually do). Timothee Chalomet is phenomenal as Laurie. He really does an exceptional job of making us understand WHY he loves Jo and how he could potentially move on to Amy. The Jo-Laurie-Amy problem still exists to some extent, but it is actually addressed and I think in a lesser actor & filmmaker's hands, it would be troubling. Saoirse and Timothee have such amazing chemistry, it is a perfect casting. \nSaoirse does an amazing job as Jo and even layers in some things I never even considered for the character. Overall, I think if you are a FAN of this work, you will love this. Those new to the story might get a little confused, but it is well worth watching no matter what.",

            "content": "Listen to the girls.  So this is the story of four sisters growing up together in a household.  One is a writer (Saoirse Ronan), and they say write what you know, so she's going to tell her story.  Now I've managed to go 33 years of my life without experiencing this story.  It wasn't by design, mind you, it simply wasn't on any of my reading lists in high school.  I've never seen any of the other six film adaptations, so even though this is a tale that is over 150 years old, it is still new to me.  I can't say that I generally connect with period pieces, but every so often there is an exception to the rule, and Little Women is most certainly that.  Now the two biggest reasons I adore this film as much as I do are the acting and the direction.  This is helmed from Greta Gerwig who previously directed Lady Bird, and she has only honed her craft since then.  She knows when to go into deep focus and knows when to pull back, and she should be a serious contender for Best Director this year, despite being snubbed at the Golden Globes.  She works well with her actors to get some fantastic performances, and there isn't a weak performance in the bunch.  These are subtle yet powerhouse performances delivered from an all-star cast, and I was very much enthralled from start to finish.  Every single one of these girls has a lot of personality, and even though you're jumping from sibling to sibling, you feel like you know each and every one of them.  I typically get on period pieces for being stuffy, but that is absolutely not the case here, and I think that has a lot to do with how the script was adapted.  Now that I'm critically thinking about this in retrospect, I don't really have any major complaints about this.  The story is told out of order, which I suppose may be confusing for some people, but I had no trouble following.  In fact, I think it actually works as a positive to make you feel the correct emotion in the flow of the narrative; you see exactly what you're supposed to see when you're supposed to see it, and because of that, Little Women ends up being emotionally successful.  I give this a big-time recommendation, and you should absolutely watch this.",

The reviews have been exceptional, and I was drawn to see what all the fuss was.\u00c2 \nI was not in my comfort zone watching this movie. I even thought this movie took place in England, and I thought there was more then four girls. I quickly got confused with the story. It didn't help with having a ton of flashbacks. Not knowing the story, I wasn't sure if I was in the past or present or both.\nI finally decided to sit back and just enjoy the ride. The dialogue was a bit tiring, and having a group of girls all talking at once was distracting. What I did enjoy was the absolutely fantastic cinematography. Many scenes were akin to looking at Impressionist or Americana era paintings. Mind blowing.\nThe relationships with the sisters brought back memories of my girls growing up. Like the characters in the movie, my girls all had very distinct and strong personalities. I got a bit emotional at the right moments...insert small tear here.\nI did enjoy the film like reading a good novel. Just ask my wife about how I wanted to read the ending before it was over.",

The March sisters have always been strong women of their time (and any era) but the downplay of Frederick was ridiculous, since he very much influenced Jo's work, something that didn't show in the movie.  The era also influenced the story, eg. the March/Alcott families were temperance people, you wouldn't be sneaking a drink at a small family wedding.\n\nthe 1994 version was shorter than this one yet was slower in telling the story and hit all the same major plot points without a lot of squealing, underwhelming conversation. \n\nThe cinematography was very good as were the costumes.",

            "content": "Very subversive for the late 1860s and the 1870s in more ways than it might appear at first glance.  Little Women (2019) is a well done piece of filmmaking. The casting is spot on, with our 4 March girls, being lead by Saoirse Ronan as Jo. I think Laura Dern as the mother, Marmee, is particularly affecting. The cinematography, art direction, and score all do a fine job transporting the viewer to a Concord Mass, New York, and Paris of the 19th century.  I have a few quibbles. The chief one is that the aging of the characters is sometimes weakly communicated. The films in an intercut set of sequences 7 years apart, and it feels to me as though the characters who are going from roughly 16 to 23 would transform more physically more than some hair styling.  The result is some moments of confusion when trying to figure out what time period a scene occurs in. There is an exception in the styling of Florence Pugh's Amy, who maturation from pig tails to married woman is very striking. I cannot quite put my finger on why the language and body moments seem anachronistic. Given that LW and Downton Abbey no doubt share a similar fan base and are separated by 55 years or so, they feel worlds apart with the Little Women seeming the more modern. Speaking of Downton, it struck me very early how each of these films executes a lovely romance dance on the veranda away from the hustle and bustle more conventional party goers, portraying the same \"we are the outsiders\" message.  Saying that Little Women is very good, but didn't blow me away seems like faint praise.",

What point was the film trying to make about how fiction will only sell if any female heroine is either married or dead by the end?? The film simply ends up affirming both propositions. How did Amy go from 'marriage is an economic transaction' and 'I will not be the person you settle for' to declining Fred's proposal three seconds after Laurie gave her 'that look'?? And since when was Laurie ever interested in Amy at all??? (And don't try to tell me that I should read the book \u2013 a movie must be able to stand on its own.) \nIf the film had spent more time giving its pivotal final scenes, including Jo and Friedrich's relationship, greater nuance, it would have come out much the better for it.\nThe acting, production and costume design are otherwise splendid.

There is the book based on the Alcott family about the Marches as Loiuisa in it as Joe but then there is Louisa herself apart from the story in her book and she is now allowed freedom to tell the story as she would have liked.

Not ugly crying tears, but the kind that make your eyes well up because you feel so much for what the characters are going through, or want so much to tell them to choose a different option even though the story is already set in stone. I found myself luck to be in an empty theatre late at night and i was fervently yelling at certain characters throughout the movie.

Watching this movie was like anticipating a beautiful 10 course meal at the best restaurant in the world with a partner you love, but arriving to be served each course randomly, dessert first, only one bite at a time, and it turns out it's not from scratch chocolate mousse, it's some grocery shelf chocolate pudding. Continuing with this metaphor, you know early on it's going to be poorly executed and you're sitting through it hoping it turns around. This movie puts all other storylines/courses in rapid fire, social-media-feed, random chaotic order, with the lack of complexity passion and coherent storyline and message, and as a result, an incredibly frustrating experience for the watcher wherein your head is spinning and you cannot emotionally attach to the material over the two hours you are required to sit for this. The March family character profile was so singular and vanilla it was difficult to differentiate between sisters, a disappointing result with this quality cast. Amongst an outstanding cast, there were no moving portrayals save Mama March losing her daughter (again a very brief moment). The music is irritatingly jumpy and not aligned to the content of the screen material. The best part of the movie is the book binding scene, the worst is the attempted feminist message at the end that the audience is completely unprepared for throughout the smiley/too light progression until that point.",

Alcott's literary classic, I'm practically a virgin as I've avoided reading the books or watching any of the numerous screen adaptations, and if it wasn't for the Oscar buzz, I probably wouldn't have bothered with this one either. That's because the story of the four March sisters, each with their individual personalities and ambitions, struggling to cope with societal pressures as well an uncertain future after the US Civil War is, as expected, an old-fashioned and conventional melodrama that I feel I've seen before. What is refreshing and impressive, however, is how Greta Gerwig's adaptation extrapolates, condenses and re-jiggles the various storylines, originally presented in a linear and chronological structure, into a non-linear one that jumps around and between two time periods seven years apart, and blows off the cobwebs to reveal a far more reflective and contemporary film. Quickening the pace and cutting down the hefty source material to its leanest form, it manages to retain its essence, though written 150 years ago, that still resonates with viewers nowadays. It also helps that it looks amazing and sumptuous, with stylish framing, beautiful costume designs and Alexandre Desplat's classy score. Saoirse Ronan's Jo anchors the film well while Florence Pugh's Amy is re-conceived as a more sympathetic character who's practical and worldly; but I find Timothee Chalamet's Laurie a bit too contemporary and out of place. Ultimately, this is Gerwig's film and by amping up its feminist qualities and infusing it with a sense of modernity, this latest incarnation justifies its existence by being thoughtful and pertinent, and I am almost ready to forgive its corny and generic plotting by the time we reach the slightly reworked ending that straddles the line between being faithful to the original and an ending that this book truly deserves.",

This is particularly true for its almost-laughable screenplay, whose contemporary dialogue doesn't even begin to adequately suit the film's 19th Century setting. The nonlinear storytelling approach often doesn't work, either, given that there are few recognizable distinctions to separate different time frames from one another. And, while many of the portrayals are solid -- Florence Pugh, Laura Dern, Timothee Chalamet and Meryl Streep -- one can't help but cringe at the overwrought, award-baiting performance of Saoirse Ronan, whose mugging for the camera becomes tiresome quickly.

Some scenes look like paintings.  And the story is great, life affirming for me! The costumes, score, cinematography. This should (no, I say this will!) get nominations for all of that as well as some acting, adapted screenplay and best picture.

I know this story inside and out and I can\u2019t tell what the director was trying to do here. What a waste! The only saving graces were the few original story elements that were accurate, the acting by Emma and Saoirse, and a few randomly added comments about economic equity, plus the scene showing the Hummels\u2019 poverty. That said, Laura Dern was a horrible Marmee and Chris Cooper was a terrible Mr. Laurence. Oh it pains me to see these beautiful characters so misrepresented! Besides the incredibly choppy and confusing timelines that deflated every opportunity for intimacy or connection, the actors were so clearly not their correct ages. Timothee looks like he\u2019s 13 years old throughout the movie, even at the end when\u2019s he\u2019s supposed to be holding his baby! And Emma Watson as Meg was ridiculous when all her sisters looked older than her, not to mention that they all looked like they were adopted from different families! How are we supposed to believe they\u2019re related?! Also annoying was the inconsistent language style, sometimes going for modern and quippy and other times trying to sound old and proper. Holy cow, it was so bad! I really don\u2019t know what the director thought she was doing with this slap in the face attempt at one of the best novels and stories in American history.",

There also wasn\u2019t enough music in the score to carry the depth of the plot and emotions along and help connect the scenes either. The sets and costume designs were great, too, though some of the actors did not visually suit their roles as well, and the story painted every character as a wonderful character, almost unrealistic.

First, if I did not know the story I would be very lost because of the continuous jumping back and forth from past to present literally throughout the whole picture, that is the format the writer/director chose, unfortunately.  Second, the actor who played \"Teddy/Laurie\" was much too young and very slender.  He had this sweet baby face and never grew up, but remained looking like a 17 year old young man even when he should have been in his mid-twenties and bulked up a bit with maturity.  Third, Jo's relationship with the older professor she meets at a boarding house in New York barely scratches the surface.  The only scene really she has with him is when he is reading her writing samples, gives them a harsh critique, she gets mad and leaves the city to go back home to attend to her sick sister Beth.  You don't see him or hear of him again until the very end of the movie when Jo is supposedly \"in love\" with him and her sisters tell her to chase him down before he leaves for California.  Complete lack of character development on that one!  My favorite film of this great story is the 1994 version with Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, and Christian Bale as \"Teddy/Laurie.\"  It is worth checking out!",

I've never read the book and I don't think I've ever seen any adaptations of this but I may actually read it. I just found the story of the March sisters absolutely compelling. A story of love, loss feminism in a time of great inequality, coming of age and so much more. The movie speaks volumes to any who would see it but especially women. The movie is not preachy by any means and I was surprised at how entertaining it was funny, sad, emotionally resonant and completely engaging. The performances are just stellar across the board. Laura Dern is solid in a subtle turn as the mother. Florence Pugh of last year's Midsommar adds another great performance to her roster and Emma Watson has truly never been better. Meryl Streep is also great in a smaller role and Timothy Chalamet of Call me by your name adds another mesmerizing turn. But it's Saorise Ronan as usual who steals the show. Her Jo is modern, inspired, layered and passionate. Everyone has amazing chemistry together and the film is just one of the best I've ever seen. From the inspired cinematography like the scene on the beach with Jo and Beth to the effective score and confident, inspired direction it's truly a masterpiece I didn't see coming. Definitely the best film I've seen so far out of 2019.",

We all know the story but never has this material flourished in the medium that is cinema. Saoirse Ronan was a literal force of nature in the lead role. Florence Pugh offered forth a radiant elegance when her character had the maturity to showcase it. Emma Watson is always so adorable and this part suited her magnificently. I really have to applaud all the charms that Laura Dern brings to the world. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is ever so dashing as Laurie. As for the brilliance that is Meryl Streep, I think anyone who is endeared to movies will forever be at a lost for words regarding her imperishable legend. Newcomer Eliza Scanlen grows up right before our very eyes, to become the true heart of this film. And Bob Odenkirk with mutton chops? Yes please.

I especially liked how the film focused more on Amy and Laurie's relationship, and revealed Amy as a much more complex character than the bratty child she was portrayed as in the novel. The flash-back structure of the film allows us to reflect with Jo on her life and instills the film with nostalgia. This is an important theme in the novel, and especially for many viewers, who having read the novel as children are now adults and can relate to this sense of nostalgia for their own childhood when they first encountered this story.",

But they must try and either succumb to expectations of settling down with a man and getting married. Or to fight against the power of men and make it on there own. Wow what a beautifully crafted movie with so much warmth,charm and fantastic acting lets talk about this more in depth.\n\nFirst of all the films cinematography and aesthetics were stunning. This film was simply stunning to look at. It was so simplistic and yet so effective, i felt like i was in a massive story book. With also breathtaking dance routines and costumes that really caught your eye and left you in awe of what you were watching.\n\nNext the film was actually fairly funny and it also had a fantastic amount of emotional weight to it as well. The family dynamic between the four sisters and the mother bought a lot of relatable humour for me. As i have two sisters which made me connect slightly more with the humour that was being used. Florence Pugh who we will be talking about again soon bought me the most humour as her brutal honesty bought a few much needed chuckles. And the film also had a perfect blend of emotional weight to it as well. The film spent so much time developing all of the sisters stories that you couldn't help feeling emotionally connected to each of them. And to see the collapse of the youngest sister ( Eliza Scorn) health was incredibly heartbreaking, and seeing her death and the impact on Jo ( Saorise Ronan) was heartbreaking but also inspiring as this is what motivated Jo to right her most impactful and successful book.\n\nNext the film had a charming tone throughout,and the script was phenomenally clever and impactful. As previously mentioned seeing the family dynamic and the bond that the whole family had was truly charming and heartwarming. As it reminded me of the bond i have with my family which made me feel comfortable and at home whilst watching. And the script wow was phenomenal. Despite it being set a long time ago the script felt so modern and reflected on society today. With some brutal truths of the roles of women in society in the past and today. With some impactful lines from Saoirse Ronan and Florence pugh.\n\nNow before i get into my final positives. I do just have to say my one negative that stopped the film from being perfect for me. The film slightly overused its usage of flashbacks. So it firstly made it fairly confusing at first to know what time period you were in. And then it made the narrative slightly clunky. But this was only occasionally so didn't really effect my overall opinion of the movie. \n\nNow time for my final positives. The casting was perfect. All the performances were great and i had 3 standouts in particular. I thought the films casting was perfect for every character. And it was filled with both experienced talent and up and coming talent perfectly. And everyone did a fantastic performance. So i haven't mentioned Eliza Scorn,Emma Watson,Laura Dern or Meryl streep in my key standouts but they all did great jobs. But my key standouts were Saoirse Ronan,Florence Pugh and Timothee Chalamet. Saoirse's performance was incredible and oscar worthy in my opinion. She put so much effort and passion into her performance that you believed everything she said and did throughout the whole film making her character truly inspiring. Florence pugh was phenomenal really showing her acting versatility. With both the serious and funny moments making me excited for her future roles she takes on. And finally Timothee Chalamet who held his own in a rightfully so female dominated movie. He was charming throughout. And he also showed a great contrast with his character of the mischievous and troublesome side to him, but also his sensitive and charming side and Timothee portrayed  this perfectly. Also making me excited for his future work.\n\nOverall despite a slight over usage of flashbacks. Little women is a visually stunning,excellent crafted and acted cinematic masterpiece that deserves to be an awards contender.",

            "content": "I'm a Chalamet stan, so admittedly I'm a bit biased. But he manages to immerse himself in his roles so effortlessly that by the end of the movie I actually find myself rooting for Theodore Lawrence instead of Timothee Chalamet. It goes without saying that the acting in this movie is spectacular. Meryl Streep got to play the comedic side character, and it was refreshing and enjoyable to see her be able to shine in a different way on the big screen. Saoirse Ronan was simply delightful to watch, as expected; I'd seen her in Lady Bird, and I was pretty much blown away in laughter and tears. It was no different with Little Women; her portrayal of Jo March filled me with sadness, loneliness, mischievousness, and empowerment all at once.  \n\nTo me, the standout character in this remake of the classic tale was none other than Amy March, acted masterfully by Midsommar breakout-star Florence Pugh. Contrary to how many felt about the character in the 1994 film, this version of the character didn't annoy me one bit. In fact, at times, I sympathized with her. I know what it's like always being the second-best, and the one who never gets invited along with the bigger siblings. Pugh, although in her mid 20's, was able to perfectly encapsulate the image of a young, innocent yet mischievous pre-teen that only ever desired the hearts and attention of her sisters. It was even better to see her all grown up, sophisticated and in near-total control of her feelings. [kinda SPOILER] Although I was a little sad to see how Jo and Laurie's story turned out, it was relieving to see Amy finally get one of the things she truly wanted. \n\nOverall, the movie gave me so many feels. I felt like I was sitting in a living room with all of them, warmed by a nearby fire and the stories they told each other and laughed about. It was a movie not only about empowerment and self-reliance, but about learning when to let go of your childhood prides and fears and realize what makes you happy. Don't be afraid to chase after something even if it doesn't align with what you've been working toward; go with your gut. I left the theater feeling glorious but somehow empty at the same time. I will definitely be watching this film again.",

Standouts include Saoirse Ronan as Jo March and Timothee Chalamet as Laurie, though the whole cast is terrific. Over the course of the film, you become immersed in each sister's story to the point that even relatively low stakes situations feel cataclysmic. It's an intimate and deeply human tale that Gerwig brings to life notably. Still, the many plots of the movie feel disconnected and it never coalesces into something truly satisfying.

            "content": "4.5 Star Review: (No Spoilers here)\nIn what is sure to be an Oscar contender, Greta Gerwig masterfully directed and wrote this coming of age story of Jo March and her sisters as they deal with family hardships, love and coming to terms with how easily life can change in an instant. Set in the post Civil War years, Greta Gerwig's film is told through 2 distinct timelines set 7 years apart. Initially I was thrown off by this as there are no clues on screen for this back and forth in time save for the single caption that appears once saying \"7 years earlier.\" From that point forward, the March sisters' story is masterfully juxtaposed with what is happening in the present with the adult sisters with the scenes in the past using color hues of orange, yellow and red contrasted to the present color hues of blue, white and black. The film's cinematography and editing help in successfully telling the story in this back and forth fashion. I was very impressed how this technique in storytelling paid its dividends in a major scene involving the youngest of the sisters, Beth. The back and forth time jumping as these events unfolded with Beth made for a powerful moment in the film that may not have been otherwise possible in a linear form of storytelling.\nLittle Women is based on the 1868 novel by Louisa May Alcott of the same name. I have never read it so I can not say how much it closely follows the book or not. However, as a film it is a wonderfully crafted movie. Casting a stellar ensemble cast to portray the March sisters, Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlon all have their moments to shine in their roles but it is Ronan's role as Jo that stands out the most. Jo March is adamant about living her life the way she wants to without being bound to the societal constructs of what they deem she should be. Jo is passionate about following her dreams and becoming the author she knows she was meant to be.\nMy one quibble with the film is that of the character Laurie and how certain characters appear to be infatuated with him. I found him to be obnoxious most of the film and the way his story arc concluded did not appear to be earned, in my opinion. The ending, while cliched, was well done and will likely have many of the female fans loving how it ended. I would have preferred the ending Jo had originally intended for her book to be the same for the film. Nonetheless, Little Women is still a very good film with a stellar cast. Expect Oscar nominations for this film.",

            "content": "Heartfelt performances despite ridiculous editing choices.\n\nGreta Gerwig's period drama Little Women (2019) is a beautiful film with tender direction and powerful acting performances from a phenomenal cast. However, the editing within Gerwig's version is so rapid fire and oddly cut that I felt she rushed the story as scenes cut right when lines end with no room to breathe. Sometimes characters talk over one another as scenes are not allowed to affect you in the muddled first half until the strong second half. Gerwig is a fantastic director, whom I love and respect after seeing Lady Bird, but she fumbles Louisa May Alcott's classic tale told better in the 1994 version of Little Women starring Winona Ryder, Kirsten Dunst, and Claire Danes. Gerwig's Little Women will move you with devastating acting that made me cry, but it takes a while until those scenes get there.\n\nAside from Gerwig's striking direction and visuals and the awful editing, Alexandre Desplat's score is sweeping and inspired. He carefully fits every song to the emotions on screen with subtle musical cues that make effective scenes even more affecting. Gerwig's writing modernizes Little Women with strong speeches on the opportunities for women as well as professing the virtues of owning your own art's copyright. Some of her choices to make Amy more feminist instead of Jo feel out of place for the character, but overall Gerwig keeps things iconic and classy for her sweet Little Women. Greta Gerwig should continue to direct original concepts instead of adapting novels as Lady Bird is a stronger piece than Little Women.\n\nSaoirse Ronan is likable and gripping as Jo March. She feels like a young woman striving for a career as Ronan is as touching as Winona Ryder's portrayal of Jo. Saoirse is the greatest actress of her generation and outdoes herself as always. Laura Dern is subtle and tender just as good as gentle as Susan Sarandon's Marmie. Timothee Chalamet matches Christian Bale's iconic Laurie with a moving performance that made me cry at least three times. He may be my favorite aspect to Gerwig's Little Women. Chalamet is certainly the greatest actor of his generation after roles like Call Me by Your Name and Little Women alone. Chris Cooper is really sad and tear-jerking as Laurie's grandfather. I found him surprisingly moving.\n\nFlorence Pugh may be miscast as Gerwig makes the baffling decision to dress Pugh like a little girl to play both young Amy and older Amy in Paris. Pugh is commanding and pretty as older Amy, but ridiculous and unbelievable as young Amy. Pugh puts on a childish voice that does not convince you she is much younger despite a little girl's dress being on and her fake childish voice. Kirsten Dunst was a revelation as young Amy March, so Pugh does not compare. Florence Pugh is much stronger as the older Amy scolding Laurie for not understanding her position on marriage. I also loved Pugh during the scenes where Laurie proposes to her both times.\n\nI really enjoyed Eliza Scanlan's Beth March. She is realistic and soft spoken letting you believe she is sickly and frail. Scanlan is nearly as good as Claire Danes in the same role. Emma Watson is fine as Meg March, but she's nowhere near as good as Trini from the 1994 Little women. Meryl Streep is okay as Aunt March, but she's given nearly no lines.\n\nI did not care for Louis Garrel as the professor since he gets few lines and no development, especially compared to Gabriel Byrne's professor depiction. The man Meg marries in this is completely forgettable and not likable at all compared to the wonderful actor in the 1994 version. Bob Odenkirk is cute as the March father, but he gets little to say. I think Gerwig wasted some of her cast, but the main leads are all so resplendent, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn all, Little Women is a story near and dear to my heart as I genuinely relate to Jo and Laurie a lot, but the 1994 film is a timeless classic. I did enjoy Gerwig's movie, but it has too many odd choices to be flawless.",

            "content": "Greta Gerwig established herself as a talented director with Lady Bird (2017), but while that film had boundless charm and excellent performances, it never enraptured me the way her expertly realised sophomore film does. Little Women is brilliant. It is brilliant on a structural level, brilliant on performance level, brilliant on a design level. Greta Gerwig's adaptation is a charming, all-consuming joy. There isn't a moment that doesn't sweep you away. I left the cinema feeling lighter. It will be the film I'll watch every year on the sofa.\n\nLittle Women is a film that is alive. It is alive in the ink-stained fingers and always messy-haired Jo (Saorise Ronan) or in the scrunched-up nose, and often petulant, Amy (Florence Pugh). It is alive in the quiet spark of Beth (Eliza Scanlen) and in the girly shrill of horror when Meg (Emma Watson) has a curling iron accident. It is also alive in the way Marmee (Laura Dern) peels away her warm scarf and stuffs it into a blanket for somebody that needs it or the way Mr Laurence (Chris Cooper) sits on the staircase, stifling a cry, as the girl that reminds him of his departed daughter plays on her piano. Based on the classic novel from Louisa May Alcott, the characters are brought to life in every frame, helped by a collection of great performances and cosy attention to the details that make 1860s Massachusetts burst off the screen. The film has the colour and care that a painting has, and it often looks like one. Every corner feels lived in and the March house is the epicentre of this, crammed with the passions and laughter of the women that live there.\n\nSaorise Ronan re-joins Gerwig from Lady Bird and imbues Jo, and lynchpin of the story, with the perfect blend of messiness and fiery ambition that has made the character so endearing across generations. You feel the artistic desire that fuels and burns inside of Jo, and Ronan is naturally suited to puffing it out in moments that see her nervously waiting in the doorway as a love interest reads her work, bristling with jittery excitement only to fly into a tantrum of rage when the pompous man tells her he thinks her writing is no good \u2013 Little Women is sewn together by these small bites of character and all of them feel real.\n\nFighting Jo in the film as the jealous sister but also fighting Ronan for best performance is Florence Pugh as the young, sometimes brattish, always determined Amy. Pugh cements her excellent year with another scene-stealing performance, instilling a new-found charm and vulnerability into a character that would otherwise be spiteful and jealous. It is both a testament to Pugh's gifts as an actor and Gerwig's as a talented, observant writer. The same attention is mostly given to the other women, with Eliza Scanlan dealt a difficult hand playing the doomed and shy Beth, and yet in the brief scenes she has, she finds a way to steal a little of the spotlight\u2026 and your heart strings, building a brief and sweet relationship with Laurie's Uncle, Mr Lawrence, a fatherly figure mourning the death of his daughter. Emma Watson is reliably good but out of the four women Meg feels the most underdeveloped, although Gerwig still finds time to make you care about the direction her life has taken and what she wants, but more importantly, what she's had to sacrifice to make her cute but tested and relatable marriage with John (James Norton) work.\n\nGerwig sets down her creative marker early by opening the film with eldest sister Jo already making her way into a male dominated publishing world, hiding behind the pretence that the work she presents, her work, is courtesy of a friend. There is a small but sharp and impactful turn from Tracy Letts as the stubborn editor, slashing through half of Jo's story with a frozen glare that's certain to send a chill down any aspiring writer's spine. The film then breezes along, flowing between past and future, showing the women as squabbling sisters with clashing dreams and the different paths each of them took. The timelines are framed intelligently using colour and clothing; warm oranges and yellows flood the past, whereas the future is cloudier, the house darker and the skirts purple and blue. Structuring the script like this is the first of many decisions from Gerwig that freshens the source material and gives the timeless classic a sense of renewed energy and modernity.\n\nThe love in Little Women is tactile, charming and never soppy. Gerwig shows it in a hand entangling another, the four sisters cradling each other at their mother's feet, pillows thrown across the room or a playful punch to the shoulder. Lose yourself in the first dance between Jo and Laurie (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), a joyous piece of classical dancing and free-spirited, loose-limbed modern raving. And despite the incredible cast of women and their performances, Gerwig's secret wild card is Chalamet, who twirls through the film like a storm, his carefree arrogance and open heart both in tune and at odds with March sisters, and is, like the rest of us, pulled helplessly into their lives\n\nA standout scene, of which I could honestly choose any, sees the entire March family barge into Mr Laurence's estate, each of them caught in their own little world, enrapturing the men all at once by their sudden presence alone. In this scene it is as if the women have woken the men up from there dull and serious lives. It all just glows with warmth.\n\nIt is Gerwig's generosity to all the little things that make the book timeless, and make a great film, that ensures this adaptation reaches and soars beyond all those that have come before it. No character feels forgotten, and each have their place in the film, their own little moment in the spotlight, right down to the wonderful, joyful process of printing and binding a new book. I have no doubt that Gerwig's Little Women will reach modern classic status within a couple of years and maybe it already has.",

It seems like Gerwig wrote/directed this with the assumption that everyone who will watch this is familiar with the  novel.  In addition, there may have been certain opportunities  for humor or attempts at being funny but I think Gerwig lacks the talent for that.

For instance I normally don't like Laura Dern, but she was perfect as the mom, and Chris Cooper was great as the Lauries uncle. The movie just did a much better job than the others in developing the multitude of characters.  Another thing i particularly appreciated was the way the director chose to not tell the story chronologically.  They start the movie near the end, and then throughout the movie go back and forth from the early days to later points in the story.  This really helped you to better understand the characters and their motivations.  I must say that in this version I had a much greater appreciation for the characters of Amy and Beth.  Amy is normally just a spoiled brat.  But Florence Pugh does an excellent job playing her both young and a bit older with different motivations.  In sum, everyone on my family loved it.

Saoirse Ronan is the perfect Jo, but it is \"Midsommar\" (2019) star Florence Pugh as Amy whose character arc indelibly defines this take. They're both so strong it hardly matters that Emma Watson as Meg and Eliza Scanlen as Beth are merely good. Featuring a heart-meltingly dashing Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Laurie, Meryl Streep as a perfectly curmudgeonly Aunt March and Tracy Letts as kind-hearted Mr. Dashwood, this \"Little Women,\" with its nonlinear storyelling, is a feel-good triumph of the female spirit.",

            "content": "Little Women shows to me that I need to pay more attention to Greta Gerwig as a director. She used her direction to craft a faithful and emotional adaptation of the classic novel. Each and every performance in the film was great. Saoirse Ronan was fantastic as the lead character and Emma Watson and Timothee Chalamet do great jobs as a sister and a friend. Each character felt unique and it was interesting to watch each of them reach their lowest of lows and then reach their highest of highs. The story flows pretty smoothly although the runtime is a tad bit too long. The film is about 2 hours and 20 minutes and it really felt like it should have been just 2 hours. That's mainly due to the film's slow pacing. That being said though, there was something in each scene that interested me whether it was the lighting, cinematography, or performances. I also too slight issue with some stylistic choices in the beginning. There is a scene where Jo Marsh is running down the street and it changes to slow mo for 2 seconds and it felt weird. From the films from Greta Gerwig that I have seen, she loves using themes of love and relationships with our family a lot. She expertly hides these themes within her screenplay for the film. The film manages to pull off a lot of emotional weight. Certain scenes in the film are intended to be emotional and they worked great for me. Some directors probably wouldn't have been able to pull it off but Greta Gerwig did. The cinematography, although not the best of the year, was great. Almost every shot was interesting to look out and there was always something to pay attention to. The costume and set design are fantastic. The costumes look great and authentic to the time period while the set design is warm and inviting. The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is fantastic. It feels authentic to the time period and feels unique. Overall,Little Women is a great take on family relationships with great performances, an intelligent script, fantastic musical score, and good cinematography.",

I think for people who have not read the book or seen the 1994 or 1949 versions of the film, this film jumped around a lot to the point where a friend of mine was confused during some sections. I was even confused when the movie began, thinking perhaps the projectionist put the movie on in the middle. Then later on, it was clear that it was going to be a long series of flashbacks.  The \"romance\" between Friedrich and Jo felt forced to me. Like they tacked it on at the end as an afterthought. None of these are really enough to making me dislike the film.

Alcott's words on the subject were beautiful and succinct- you should have used them.\nWhoever was in charge of hair and costumes should be drawn and quartered- or at least never let near a period piece again.

I know the story and it was hard to follow or figure out what was going on as it went forward and backward in time constantly with no rhyme or reason. The cast was not thought through especially for character of Amy as she never changed age and seemed like the oldest more mature of the sisters.

I plan on watching the Winona Ryder version to cleanse my brain of this horrible rendition.",

She has extracted some truthful and valuable themes and lines of dialogue from this classic story and told them in such an eloquent and powerful manner. \n\nA magnificent ensemble of some of the best and most favourite actors and faultless filmmaking in every aspect elevate the total joy and poignant moments there are to be had watching LITTLE WOMEN.

            "content": "Little Women (2019) Review:\n\nGreta Gerwig writes and directs the beloved story of four of sisters coming of age in the aftermath of the Civil War.  The story is told through flashbacks and present tense mainly through the eyes of Jo March (Saoirse Ronan), Amy March (Florence Pugh), and Meg March (Emma Watson).  I really like the story of Little Women.  In 1994 we got a version with lead actress Winona Ryder and I liked that one last time I saw it.  Greta Gerwig proved to be a fantastic director with 2017s Lady Bird.  She was the only female director nominated for best director that year.  I really hope she gets nominated again this year and I think it would be amazing if she could win.  Gerwig has a way of directing to make everything feel real and personal.  I was invested in the story and the characters.  Every performance is practically flawless.  Even with Emma Watson occasionally slipping to her British accent, she still provided a great performance.  There's three performances that really stood out to me.  First off, Saoirse Ronan is perfect in every role that I've seen her in.  She is the perfect Jo March and brings life to the screen.  The sparks of creativity that lead her to write we're all genuine.  Those sparks were her becoming Jo.  I just loved her.  Second, and another actor that is perfect in every role, is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.  He plays the main love interest, Laurie.  He embodies this arrogant but fun man who is trying to get the stubborn Jo March to fall in love with him.  Chalamet's performance isn't getting the recognition it deserves.  He costarred with Ronan in Lady Bird and those two have a real chemistry.  Their energy is just perfect together.  I loved his Laurie and how he interacts with everyone.  Finally, my favorite actress of the year, Florence Pugh plays Amy March.  From what I know, in the book we're supposed to not like Amy and she's annoying.  However, Amy was my favorite character in the whole film.  Florence Pugh is a fantastic actress.  In Midsommar she gave a gripping performance and also another good performance as Saraya Knight in an underrated movie this year, Fighting With My Family.  I love her so much and she is well deserving of the Oscar for this performance.  Since the film is shown through flashbacks and present, we get to see this change of character from young her to adult.  Younger her would whine and joke around.  I loved that aspect of her character.  There's a scene where she's crying outside and then comes inside and is joking around.  I was dying of laughter.  But for every comedic part there's always something dramatic.  If Hollywood needs an actor to cry for a scene, she's the perfect choice.  In Midsommar she practically cried throughout the whole film and then parts at this.  Her crying feels real to me because it's not the typical cliche crying we usually see.  That may just be me but that's what I think.  Like I said many times, I love the performances.  The story was adapted very well and Greta Gerwig deserves the praise.  The only problem I had with the story was when it goes to the past it doesn't show that it's the past until we look at the characters and what story is happening.  There were a few attempts where the tone in the cinematography changed but there was one instance where it went back and forth sort of frequently and it was hard to keep up.  It's something you sort of have to get used to.  Speaking of cinematography, I liked it.  There's some really gorgeous shots, in particular some beach sequences.  Alexandre Desplat's score is beautiful as always.  I think he's one of the greatest composers and there's no doubt he'll get a nomination for his work on this.  Some of the songs are emotional and help with the tone.  It wasn't just the sad scenes and great performances that made me cry, but also his score.  I urge anybody to listen to his score, or any score in general, rather than some music on the radio.  People should really appreciate them more.  Listening to it before watching the film I felt some emotion during some of the songs.  I basically only listen to film scores and this is my message to get you to take some time, sit down, and just listen to the beautiful music.  If you don't know the story, I'd suggest bringing some tissues into the theater.  That goes for those who know the story as well.  I think basically everyone in the theater was crying.  This goes back to Gerwig's direction of making everything feel real.  I cried a few times.  The emotion is all there and there's no denying it.  Overall, Little Women hasn't had an adaption better than this.  I'd highly suggest seeing this.  It's made it to one of my favorites of the year.  There's no way to be disappointed. \n\nMy Grade: A",

The amalgamation of Jo March (as we know her from the book) and Louisa May Alcott is introduced for the first time. This iteration's Jo emphasizes the progressive thinking of Louisa May Alcott, her determination and sense of self, pride and worth. Certainly her struggles as a women during the mid to late 1800's drives the plot, however, they are universally relatable, as all people, at one time or another, question their sense of self, pride and worth. We see struggles through the lens of each of the March sisters, who are mirrors that allow us to see versions ourselves as we are and/or who we hope to be. Some struggles are singular to each of their artistic gifts, while others apply to women, in general, during that time period. The acting was superb! The nonlinear structure was fresh! I left the theater feeling hopeful and ready to start the new year with a sense of self, pride and worth and the belief that I have grown into the big dreams I had as a young girl!",

            "content": "An enjoyable film and I'm happy to see new themes highlighted in this generations iteration. \nWhat I liked:\n1) The cast is strong overall. I have a preference for Winona Ryder but that does not take away from the performance of our new Jo March. Meg is well performed by Emma Watson. She is unexciting but contrary to what some reviews say, I appreciate that as it reminds us that there is nothing wrong with not being exciting and that we all value different things and have varying goals for ourselves. Mr. Brookes is played with much more dimension than the previous versions, this is due to the performance but also the added length of time spent focusing on the little women as adults.\n2) I loved that it showed that you can be a feminist and still be a homemaker, an aristocrat, quiet and gentle, or fiercely independent.\n3) The edit to have Jo negotiate the same book deal Alcott did is an excellent addition and is made even better beside the randomness of the marriage she ends with. It demonstrates the marriage is not really meant to be part of the story but is simply added there to please publishers.\n4) Many of the lessons of the book and directly quoted dialogue are well covered.\n\nWhat I did not like:\n1) The cast as an ensemble. While the performances were great as mentioned above, the actors do not fit together as the characters should. Laurie looks far too young and it really is just not realistic to have Amy played by one actress throughout. She starts the story at 11 years old and is 20 by the end.\n2) Laurie was the disappointment of the cast. He was childish and boring to watch when he is meant to be just as exciting as Jo.\n3) The bouncing around with the timeline (especially with no effort made to age the cast appropriately) is confusing (especially I would imagine for those that have not read the book) and takes away from the emotional impact as well as the appreciation for the struggles and growing up that is done.\n4) The edits to make viewer more comfortable. The reality of the time is women married young and men tended to be older for example. Jo's love \"interest\" is meant to be an older German professor. We do not need to make the life of the past identical to our own to watch it. \n\nOverall, I love this story and enjoyed watching. I may rewatch in the future but the 1994 version remains my first choice.",

And it's not just the story (which has been adapted for film too many times to count already)- it is very clearly Gerwig's direction, detail, comedic hand, and amazing ability to balance the story in the most captivating way. Pugh, Ronan, and Chalamet are also absolutely captivating and PERFECTLY cast for their roles.

            "content": "By my count, this is approximately the 182nd version of Louisa May Alcott's Civil War sisterhood. There must be something universal about the trials of the March sisters and their struggles for independence, agency, love, and happy endings on their own turns. Greta Gerwig, fresh off her Oscar nominations for Lady Bird, has given Little Women a decidedly modern spin. The story flashes back and forth between past and present, sometimes in consecutive shots, and feels full of authentic youthful energy. It's also the first adaptation I've watched that has fixed the problem of Amy (Florence Pugh, affecting), widely regarded as the least liked sister. Through Gerwig's telling, she becomes a self-determined woman, just like Jo (Saoirse Ronan), who recognizes the social trappings holding her back but chooses to do her best within this unfair system rather than rage against it. It's like an empathetic reclamation for this often reviled character. The enjoyment of Little Women is how vibrant and different each of the March sisters is and how an audience can see degrees of one's self in each little woman. Jo is by all accounts our lead and her struggle to be a successful writer pushes her against conventions of the era. There is an invented and very amusing bookend where Jo bickers with a blowhard male publisher (Tracy Letts) about \"women's melodrama.\" It's a meta commentary on Alcott's book herself, especially with the helping of marriages and happy endings by story's end. Ronan is a force of nature in the film and sweeps up everyone around her with charm. Meryl Streep is supremely amusing as an older rich aunt bemoaning the girls won't get anywhere without marrying a wealthy man. The limited options for a working-class family are given great consideration, but it's really a movie that seems to pulsate with the exciting feelings of being young, having the world stretch out before you, and chasing your dream, rain or shine. It's also gorgeously shot and feels so assured from Gerwig as a solo director. There are a few detractions for this new 2019 Little Women, the biggest being how confusing it can get with its melded chronologies. If this is your first exposure to Alcott's story, I fear you'll get lost more than a few times trying to keep everything in order. The love story with lovesick pretty boy Laurie (Timothee Chalamet) feels tacked on even though it's a feature of the novel. This newly structured, reinvigorated, charming remake of a literary classic feels definitely of the period and of today. It's the first Little Women adaptation that made me realize how timeless this story really can feel in the right hands. It may be the 182nd version but it might be the best one yet.\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

Laura Dern is flawless, didn't realize that was who she was, and overall, very good. Glad the professor is finally a hunk and not a tired older gentleman that Jo \"settles\" on and in terms of the way it is written, glad for the further explanation in this one, that she does go back and forth about Laurie.  A good adaptation, much better than the one a few decades ago, Katharine Hepburn will also be \"Jo\" for me, but a really pleasant movie.",

I attended this film as a recompense for taking my wife to Star Wars IX. My wife is a fan of the original Little Women film but was just as bored as me watching this remake. She spent most of the movie fiddling with her phone and asking when it would be over. \n\nI tried to concentrate hoping that there would be some payoff, but the film's big climax was the main character staying up late and writing a book by candlelight. Spoiler: the book she writes is Little Women. It's a movie about a book where the author is writing about herself writing. It's recursive and paradoxical, but not a fun or interesting paradox like Kyle Reese becoming the father of John Connor. \n\nMy largest complaint is that this movie jumps around between flashbacks and it is hard to distinguish where you are in time. You have to pay very close attention to keep track. The only clue of timing is that the actresses' hair changes. My second big issue is that it doesn't show any of the relationship forming between Jo and her suitor. The only early scene with him is when he critiques her writing and she is insulted and storms off. He doesn't appear again until the end of the film when he makes a random visit tohher family's house and her family explains to her that she is in love, which promptly leads to a marriage proposal. \n\nI think this movie could only be appreciated by someone who read the book. The movie is too muddled to understand or care about the characters without the back story. Anyway, I should probably wake my wife up now that the movie is over.",

This version of Little Women is much more feminist in that even Amy in her debate over wether to marry Fred articulates a full awareness of the state of womens rights at the time and the transactional effect it had left on marriage.  Both she and Jo comment on the impact this has had on their own decision making.  As much as I adore Laurie, it was satisfying to hear Amy call him out for the hypocrisy of a man judging a woman for being  pragmatic about marriage rather than waiting for true love when he and every other man know very well how risky it is to do otherwise, as we see later when even Jo has second thoughts which I also thought was great to include because it was realistic as to what would genuinely be going through her mind- but I also love the speech she gives at that same moment when she is talking To her mother that the true reason she is even reconsidering marriage is once again nothing to do with love but just an attempt to break out of the little box her society has put her into.   She says it right then that civil war society refused to allow a world where a woman can have love and ambition, and it is creating that sense of loneliness.

But Emma Watson's Meg is colorless and inconsequential, Florence Pugh as Amy is too contemporary in appearance and demeanor to be believable as a 19th century woman (which could also be said of Laura Dern as Marmy), and there's nothing memorable about Eliza Scanlen as poor Beth. She and all the sisters, in fact, suffer from the plot jumping around over 7 years but the same actresses playing them and there not being much distinction about what age/plotline is being shown. I've asked 2 people unfamiliar with the story if they knew what was going on, and they said no \u2014 there's a lot of assumption by Greta Gerwig that everyone knows the book. Chalamet rescues Laurie, but poor Friedrich is reduced to a clownish figure whose appeal to Jo makes no sense. But here's the overarching problem, for me: The heart of the story is the love among the sisters amid a father away at war, coping with challenging, humble circumstances. This March family seems to lack for nothing \u2014 warm lovely home, beautiful clothes, travel to the seashore, etc. That provides a less convincing backdrop for Alcott's story.

Instead of telling the story in a linear fashion, Gerwig begins in the present and then flashes back and flashes forward and back again, etc., unpeeling layers of meaning and emotion in the process. The cast is superb--Saoirse Ronan is dazzling as is the camera work and musical score. Why would Gerwig choose to present the narrative complexly rather than in a straightforward manner? The latter approach has already been done ad nauseum, for one. Secondly, Gerwig has made Jo into Alcott's alter ego, and as Jo struggles to get published in New York, she reminisces about her adolescence and early adulthood in the March family. When one thinks, there are no time constraints--you can be anywhere, anytime you want and jump freely as your thoughts inspire you. As the audience for the film witnesses this random sequencing, we experience new anticipations, meanings, and insights not possible in a linear presentation. If the movie frustrated you, I urge you to watch it again with these ideas in mind at a bargain theater or certainly on cable--the experience will be rewarding.",

Good Lord, I would imagine, if you were not entirely familiar with other versions or the book, it could be confusing, esp since the characters really don't change pysically in the decade they are portrayed.  Laurie/Teddy, looks like a 16 yr old Eurotrash boytoy model all the way through the decade..same with Amy who looked 20 yrs old as a 12 yr old. \nThis version, for me anyway, was not able to bring any investment from me to the characters..esp the men portrayed, but also to the sisters and Marmie. Everything was gorgeously shot, nicely acted and terribly dull and lifeless.\n\nOh and please, don't get me started on Amy's feminist speech, or Marmees \"I'm ashamed of my country\"...so they could squeeze in a line for a person of color and call it a day. Making sure to be inclusive and self aware of women's social status of the era lest we as an audience somehow are unaware of this or think the filmmakers are unaware and get our collective panties in a wad.\n\nInstead of making another Little Women movie, I think the producers and director of this movie should have made a film about Alcott's life, her struggles and how they influenced the shaping of Little Women..that would have been interesting and I think they would have done that justice..but not here, not with this movie.",

The movie cuts back and forth between time periods over 10 years and it was a challenge to pick up where we were in the chronology.

I also was disappointed that so many non American actors were used for this quintessential American story.  While I love Emma Watson and Saoirse Ronin, and the latter was amazing in this piece, their American accents failed them at times and was distracting for this particular story.

I have not read the original novel, nor have I seen any of the previous versions of this, so I watched the film with no preconceptions. When I watch a Gerwig film I feel like I am being guided into a special place, and this film is no exception. She is a brilliant director who gets the most from her actors in this film about these 4 women finding their voices in 19th century but feels relevant. Jo March (Saoirse Ronan), the oldest, is strong-willed and trying to establish herself as a writer with her own unique voice. Her publisher wants her to make sure that her writing ends with the woman getting married and her aunt (played by the wonderful Meryl Streep) tells her that marriage is her only option. Her sisters are Meg (Emma Watson), who wants to be an actress, May (Florence Pugh), who aspires to be a famous painter, and Beth (Eliza Scanlen). They are guided by their mother, played by Laura Dern, to be true to their own inner voices and to find their own paths, not those that have been pre-determined for them. The actresses playing the four sisters do a great job, especially Ronan who carries the film. Timothee Chamelet, who plays the rich neighbor Laurie, is excellent in his supporting role as the young man who finds joy with the women. The cinematography and score are also excellent, and Gerwig makes interesting and effective use of alternating between past and present to tell the women's stories. I loved the film - it is a thoughtful period piece, with just the right amount of humor, that gives center stage to the energy and determination of women. Kudos to Gerwig for crafting a film that leaves you feeling really satisfied when the film is over.",

            "content": "An ensemble you'll fall in love with.\n\nFUN FACT:\nThere have been 8 film adaptations of the Louisa May Alcott novel and 5 of them are rated a 7.2 on IMDB. Also, 3 of these film adaptations have been within the last 3 years. For reasons unknown these facts amaze me.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\nA story of Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) coming of age with her sisters while trying to support herself with writing stories for the newspaper and attempting to live outside of the social norm of what's expected of a woman during the 19th century.\n\nREVIEW SUMMARY:\nThis was a lovely cast with lots of chemistry. I started off really enjoying the film and would've rated it higher if it had not veered off of the strongest part of the story. In my opinion, Jo March's story was most interesting along with her friendship/romance with Laurie (Timothee Chalamet). Although they do make her the main character of the story, I felt they took a little too much time with some of the other sisters. I wish they did less with Meg March (Emma Watson) and Amy March (Florence Pugh) had a situation where her half of the story could've been really interesting, but it almost felt like a huge important chunk of her story was left on the cutting room floor. With that being said, the movie was very sweet, but I think it's going to fall a little bit outside of my top 10 for this year. 7.4/10.\n\n-------------------------------------BREAKDOWN------------------------------------------\n\nDIRECTION:\nGreta Gerwig is a solid director, but between this and \"Lady Bird\", she isn't necessarily a name I need to go out and see work from. I understand that these two films have been very critically acclaimed, but I have yet to be convinced through the direction. There's nothing that I see and think \"wow, no other director could do that.\" In fact, between these last two I think there are quite a few that could successfully pull these films off. There have literally been 7 other directors of Little Women (even if this has the highest rating of them all). This is more of an editing flaw, but there were times near the beginning where I wasn't quite sure which time-period we were in. Like, we're flipping between present day (in the film) and 7 years prior and though I had a hunch which point in time were at due to the color difference, I still struggled a couple of times. Also, why was Timothee Chalamet's hair all \"cover of GQ magazine?\" I was waiting for him to pull out his iPhone 11.\n\nWRITING:\nNow Greta Gerwig strived here in the writing. Give credit to Louisa May Alcott for the original story, but Greta Gerwig did write the screenplay. It's always hard to adapt a book into a movie and it's impossible to compare when you're like me and haven't read the book. As I mentioned in my review summary, there were flaws. Specifically with the character of Amy March. There's a subplot of the story with her and someone else where I don't really know how the transition from 7 years prior to present day happened. It really didn't make sense to me and that's all I can say without spoiling it. That's why I feel like there was possibly more to her story that would patch that up, but it wasn't in the movie and that's unfortunate, because her story might've been the most interesting, if not for Jo's story.\n\nACTING:\nEverything is amazing her except for one minor thing. Emma Watson does not have the American Accent down. Clearly they weren't going for a Mid-Atlantic accent as people had during that period, so her having trouble with the American accent through me off slightly. Again, very slightly, not enough to make me hate it or anything and I could never hate Emma Watson. She might be my dream girl. Her natural beauty is something of angels. *clears throat* Anyway, the acting in this film is so good otherwise. Timothee Chalamet is A-List and Florence Pugh kills it. Honestly, I wouldn't be mad if anyone in this film was nominated for an Oscar, but I don't think any of them should win an Oscar. I could most definitely see this film winning a Best Ensemble award.",

Pugh's more willful Amy often stole the scenes from Saoirse Ronan's Jo.    This version also expanded on the relationship between Amy and Laurie, so their final love seemed more deserving and natural than the other version.  The ending was also more crowd-pleasing than the 1994 version: everyone lived happily ever after, so much so that I felt this version should have been a Disney movie.",

The synergy between the sisters in the original, Susan Sarandon as the archetypal mother, Winona Ryder winning the hearts of so many women with her performance as joe; but like any lover of that film; I wanted to see how this one stacked up. \n\nSaoirse (sp?) did a brilliant Jo, even if she can't approach Winona. Emma Watson was a respectable Meg. But the casting of Beth and Amy were flawed. To ask the audience to believe Florence Pugh (as Amy) is 8 or to care about Eliza Skanlen (as Beth) after her minimal screen time and impact were foul plays. No one will see the same woman who so adeptly plays a witch on big little lies as a convincing Marmy...Dern felt hollow. \n\nNow Timothy Chalamet...he really blew it! While this kid can act, in this film he gave us but one narcissistic and immature note. Perhaps the role to which he played a man child was intentional as this was a reinterpretation, but the result was someone I preferred not to see more of, and with whom I couldn't sympathize.\n\nSaoirse and the beautiful costume and cinematography plus attention to historical detail made this film. While it won't be one I'll rewatch again and again, it was a highly enjoyable 145 minutes where Saoirse succeeded in getting at the heart of Jo March- a woman who was brave enough to be herself in a time this was a heroic act. That story is fresh all over again, in a time when women have renewed reasons to feel unsteady with our place in society.",

This is directed by Greta Gerwig who did one my favorites Lady Bird (2017) and she absolutely knocked it out of the park with this one. Little Women is the story of four sisters and their coming of age story. Set during the late years of the Civil War we follow Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) an inspiring writer, Meg (Emma Watson) the eldest sister who wants a family, Amy (Florence Pugh) a talented artist, but always feels she's battling it out with Jo, and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) who is excellent at playing Piano, but very much a quiet and to herself kind of person. The four girls live with their mother Marmee (Laura Dern) while their father (Bob Odenkirk) is away during the way. The movie is shown in the present time with all four sisters away trying to find themselves Jo is out in New York trying to be a writer, Amy is off at Europe with their somewhat mean Aunt March (Meryl Streep) learning more about art, Meg has married, but lives close by to their original home and Beth has stayed home because her health is declining. When a letter reached Jo that Beth has gotten deathly ill she drops everything and returns home which in turns churns memories of their times as kids seven years past. Jo recalls meeting Theodore 'Laurie' Laurence (Timothee Chalamet) the grandson of their neighbor Mr. Laurence (Chris Cooper). Laurie has always been very close to the March family and is in a bit of a love triangle with Jo and Amy. Jo has to finally decide by the end whether or not a women like herself can be sufficient by herself, or does in fact need a man like Laurie. There's obviously way more to it, but I've already said too much about the plot here. I really loved this movie a lot. The performances are outstanding. The four sisters are very believable as their interactions are very sibling like. We get a lot of arguments, but we get a lot of love. I liked how you really felt for them as they were going through their own issues. Beth is probably the character we get the least out of, but it fits her character since she's the least spoken out of the four. Timothee Chalamet is absolutely fantastic as Laurie. He really embodies this character and you get a feel for what he's going through especially after a harsh turn down from Jo. I liked this film and through it has a great plot (based on the novel) as well as some outstanding performances. This is one not to miss. Definitely, check this one out while it's in theaters!",

Greta Gerwig truly is one of the best young writers and directors working today.

Lady Bird is one of my favorite films of 2017 and definitely one of the best that year. Honestly, I didn't expect anything of this film, and I believed that I would end 2019 not even having seen it. I haven't seen any of the previous adaptations, and frankly this story just didn't interest me. My biggest fear was that I would be bored with the film, but gladly that wasn't the case! I really enjoyed this film; I was engaged the entire time, mainly appreciating the phenomenal script, amazing performances, and the beautiful costumes and 19th-century set pieces. There is a framing device used of jumping between flashbacks and future events, with the flashbacks being brightly lit, and the future events being a lot colder, in more of a grey tint. Toward the film's end, the cuts between time periods tend to jump a bit sporadically and the colors blend, so it's likely some may get lost in what is happening on screen. This is the film's biggest flaw for me, and yet is still full of wonderful, warm, tragic, and heartbreaking stories.\n\nEliza Scanlen, Laura Dern and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet are excellent in their roles. Florence Pugh is a STAR and I'm always excited to see what she has coming next. She has had a brilliant last couple of years, everything she has done, one amazing performance after the next! But this really is Saoirse Ronan's film. Her chemistry with the rest of the cast, her sisters, other family members and friends is great; such a treat to see these stories unfold as the cast works off each other's passion. Again, just as with Lady Bird, she gives an out of this world performance. This team of Greta Gerwig, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Saoirse Ronan will always make magic, I'm sure. So glad to say I enjoyed this film so much, ending my 2019 film journey on a positive note! I definitely recommend seeing and supporting it.",

Jo was the only believeable character - and I'm even a fan of Laura Dern. But no, this part was not for her.\n2. The monologues when the characters were reading letters was cringy to put it in my daughter's words. Out of place, awkward and did not fit with the rest of the movie.\n3. Why not just tell the story from start to finish, like the book, instead of doing 3-time-warp-flash-back-and -forward until the viewer's head is spinning. The only way you can tell time keeps swapping back and forth is the length of Jo's hair.\n4. Laurie looks like a 14-year-old boy throughout the entire movie.\n5. Amy looked like a 30-year-old woman throughout the entire movie, she's too rough around the edges, not believable as one of the little women. Nothing about this actress says Little Women, not her voice, her looks, her acting. Terrible casting.\nMajor disappointment. There's several hours and $25 of our life, wasted.",

It unequivocally affirms my worst opinion of Rotten Tomatoes, which positively rates this movie at 95%.\n\nThis movie is all-round bad. Its poorly written script fundamentally changes the original story just to inject a faux feminist overtone. So is its casting. In trying to distinguish it from previous movie adaptations (and presupposing its audience already knows the story), this movie randomly flips the timeline and sequence of events back-and-forth. Not only does it kill plot cohesion, it fails to give most actors a chance to develop their roles. Purporting to address the issue of feminism of this era (Massachusetts during the Civil War in 1860's), it blasts marriage as merely an \u2018economic proposition', which is true - except it does so casually in 3 lines of one dialog. \n\nIn my view, the 1949 (Elizabeth Taylor) and 1994 (Susan Sarandon) adaptations of \u2018Little Women' are fantastic classics. Why they bother to make such an inferior one in 2019 really beats me. Only guess is : director Greta Gerwig has no clothes !",

The narrative maze can be disorientating at times but there are strong visual clues to guide along the way and pays off quite incredibly.\n\n'Little Women' is a phenomenal tour de force of cinema - don't miss it.",

            "content": "Little Women\nLittle Women is a timeless story told through the lenses and pen of the talented Greta Gerwig. Do we need a new version of Alcott's masterpiece? It's the question that everyone, included me, asked when the project was mentioned in 2018 and indeed we needed to see for the first time Alcott's characters be freed of the commercial stereotype of what a women's novel and their fictional ladies must do to be liked.\nBeautifully shot in Massachusetts, the place where Alcott grew up, we see the March sisters story develop not in a linear narrative but through the eyes and experiences of each sister in different points in their life. This decision fleshes out Meg, Amy, Beth and Jo, we truly see what drives each character included their passion and fears, we no longer vilify Amy as a spoiled brat, we can understand her frustration of not being quite as talented as she hoped for in her paintings and Beth and Marmee are more human; they finally acknowledge the injustice of Beth's fate which makes it easy for Marmee to say \u2018that she is angry everyday', this characters are no longer porcelain dolls but human beings.  \nJo March the fearless leader who was portrayed with great pathos by Saoirse Ronan is no longer the focal point of this story thanks to Gerwig's direction we finally see the story of the other characters develop in their point of view. Meg's story is of sacrifice and patience what most women's story was about at that time when they married for love, Beth's innocence and Amy's ambition and frustration of wanting more in a world in which women weren't allowed to be themselves. The male gaze is well represented through their companions, but no one shines brighter that Chalamet's Laurie a vulnerable and lost boy who is adopted and cared for by the March family and who later matches Amy's bravado and accepts Jo's friendship.\nThis story was brilliantly told through flashbacks and we can see the golden glow of childhood when hopes and dreams are built and the gray palette of adulthood. This film is a masterpiece of dialogue adapted by Gerwig and finally be told like Alcott would have wanted, it took 151 years but the story of the March sisters and their complex relationships and life was finally set free of romanticism.",

Over the 150 years since it\u2019s 1868/9 publication, Little Women has been made into multiple movies, stage plays, television series and even an opera. How can this uber familiar story possibly be told again? We all know the plot, the characters and the raison d'\u00eatre. Little Women was the choice for our family\u2019s going-to-a-movie-every-Christmas-Day tradition. Entertain me. Educate me. Encourage me. Please. And it did! The scenery gorgeous, characters delightful, story irresistible. I can understand why Little Women offered a now tame, but in the day a groundbreaking invitation for young ladies to envision and expand their life possibilities. At the same time, a woman\u2019s traditional, domestic lifestyle, challenged by feisty, brilliant Jo was preserved by beautiful, bright Meg. The revolutionary notion introduced by Alcott is choice. The film follows the March family \u2013conventional Meg (Emma Watson), writer Jo (Saoirse Ronan), pianist Beth (Eliza Scanlen), artist Amy (Florence Pugh) and doting mother Marmee (Laura Dern) as they come to maturity during and after the Civil War. Rounding out the central figures are lad Laurie (Timothee Chalamet) a wealthy, orphaned neighbor who becomes a de facto family member and prosperous, spinster Aunt March (Meryl Streep), the self-appointed guardian of social pedigree, looking for at least one niece who will marry well, salvage the family name and keep the \u201cFamily March\u201d afloat. The flashback, nonlinear way the story is told caused me some confusion but I finally came up with my own cues to alert me to time shifts and guide my tracking. It\u2019s no fun to be left behind, stuck in the past when the action jumps to the future. Hey, where\u2019d everybody go! The film is full of romance, unrequited and realized, tragedy and comedy, poignant moments and outrageous indiscretions. Little Women was the perfect Christmas Day movie.

            "content": "Now, I've never actually read Little Women by Louissa May Alcott, but I have vague memories of seeing a play of it when I was little and I've just now skimmed the Wikipedia expert so I guess I'm an expert now.\nThere's a lot to love about this new adaptation about Meg (Emma Watson), Jo (Saoirse Ronan), Beth (Eliza Scanlen) and Amy (Florence Pugh) March. The movie cleverly intertwines both the past and the present, contrasting the cheerful youth of the four sisters with the more dreary present. The flashbacks are all coated with warmer tones giving a sense of coziness to the girls memories in sharp contrast to the cold blues of the present. Little Women is not the first movie to have flashbacks in a different color tone than the main story, but Greta Gerwig manages to make all the colors come from the natural environment, making both the flashbacks and present day feel very real despite looking very different. \nThe movie, like the story, centers around the second oldest sister, Jo, as she grows up over the seven-some years that the movie covers. Jo is tomboyish and generally opposed to playing the feminine part that society wants her to play. The movie begins with her struggling as a writer in New York, writing harsh and violent stories in an effort to make her writing relevant in a world of men. Despite managing to sell many of her stories, she is told very early on by a fellow tutor at the home that she works at teaching children, Friedrich Bhaer (Louis Garrel), that her stories simply aren't good. The movie never admonishes her dislike of traditional femininity, but over the course of the movie she learns that it is possible to embrace her life as a woman and all that entails while still maintaining her sense of identity. Ronan excels both at her hard resilience against the marital institution and all other misogynistic institutions and the softer, more sensitive side of Jo that loves her sisters and eventually \nLittle Women ends up being both a celebration for both women who fight against society and push for greatness and women who choose to live a domestic life with a husband and kids and women who choose to live both lives. The movie begins with Jo's publisher saying that if she is going to write a female protagonist that she has to be either married at the end or dead and it's treated as if it's another example of the suppression of women's stories. Then, at the very end of the movie, when Jo has brought her new novel, an autobiography or memoir finally allowing Jo to embrace her domestic side, to be published, the same publisher insists that if Jo needs to marry off her protagonist, an extension of Jo herself, saying that marrying the protagonist off isn't patriarchal, it's romantic. Once again there's a hint of misogyny, but Jo amusedly agrees to the marriage as the movie intercuts to her chasing her recently discovered love Bhaer to the train station. \nThe rest of the sisters build off this film in their own ways. There's a flashback early on in the movie where each girl through some way or another announces their passion and what they want to do with their lives. Meg wants to be an actress, Beth wants to play music and Amy wants to be a painter. Out of the three, Florence Pugh is easily the strongest as Amy. Amy has similar ambition to Jo, but also loves elegant life and realizes that she will have to marry rich in order to provide for her family. Pugh manages to turn what would otherwise be an annoying, selfish character into a real person who's attention seeking as most younger siblings are while also ambitious and yearning for genius or something that could let her make her mark in a world of men while also being very aware that she'll have to marry some rich man simply to have money that she can take care of her sisters and family with. Pugh becomes almost a second lead to Ronan, rivaling her in depth and growth in character. Unfortunately, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen get less to do with Meg and Beth respectfully. Emma Watson plays Meg similarly throughout the entire movie and although there is some sort of sub-plot of her learning to settle for domesticity with her husband John Brooke (James Norton), it doesn't quite feel that she's grown from the experience or changed at all. Scanlen does a fine enough job portraying Beth but unfortunately, the movie doesn't do quite enough to endear us to her besides the occasional nice thing that she says followed by all the sisters saying that \"Beth is the best of us\". The fact that Beth never quite comes into her own as a character diminishes the emotional punch of her death somewhat and makes her appear as more of a narrative device to allow Jo to embrace domestic life more. Nevertheless, Scanlen portrays the shy warmth of Beth very well and, what the script lacks, she is able to make up.\nThe rest of the supporting cast fares about as well as the sisters, with a few shining while a few others disappoint. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet excels as Laurie, playing both the lazy, rich boy along with the endearing neighbor and love interest. Chris Cooper does a fine job as his grandfather Mr. Lawrence and Meryl Streep turns in a very entertaining role as Aunt March. It's Laura Dern however, that proves to be the weakest, not that she isn't trying, but it is simply hard to believe her as the mother to the four girls. As for Bob Odenkirk and Tracy Letts, they play such insignificant roles that you wonder why they're in the movie at all even though Amy needs a love interest and the sisters need a father. The movie might have benefitted from cutting them all together, because as it is it's asking the audience to have some connection to characters that almost don't exist.\nIn the end Little Women will be very poignant for some and a enjoyable enough use of two hours for others. This isn't a movie that's going to blow a lot of people away, but what you're left with is a well crafted story of family and femininity that gets better and better the more you think about it.\n\nP.S. Emma Watson really struggled with an American accent, I'm not normally the type of person to pick up on these things but it was painfully obvious at many points.",

I thoroughly enjoyed watching the young ladies recognize (and give voice to) the impediments that women faced in their time (and to a certain extent, currently) - and how they overcame them. \n\nThe acting was first-rate by all. Although he had a relatively small (but important) role - I liked Chris Cooper and imagined the Bourne Identity guy gets older, mellows and meets the Marches. I've liked Emma Watson in many of the things she's done - and she doesn't disappoint in this movie.  Saoirse Ronan was spectacular.  I'd never seen (nor even heard of) either Florence Pugh or Eliza Scanlen - but they did fine jobs and I'll look for them in future movies.\n\nAs (necessarily) with all movies of great books - I found the plot/character development to be a bit thin. Why did Amy get to go to Europe instead of Jo? Did young Meg really want to become an actress - and if so, how did John Brooke woo her away from that ambition? What did Beth actually die of - and over what period of time?  I'm sure these and other questions were more fully developed in the book. I think it's the sign of a good movie when it makes me want to read the book(s) on which it is based - and this one did.  I think that the idea of telling the story in a series of flash-backs and flash-presents was a good one (my wife, who has read the books, tells me that the story is presented in the books in a strictly chronological manner).\n\nAll in all - it's an engaging movie that is part 'buddy' movie and part 'family' movie that shows how a group of ambitious, plucky young ladies find themselves and overcome both emotional and societal hurdles to reach a (mostly) happy ending.  I'd recommend it to everyone.",

Here is what I have a hard time wrapping my mind around: Amy is too old in this version. She looks the oldest and her voice is quite deep, therefore, she comes across much older. Because she comes across as a 20-something-year-old, versus a young girl, it's hard to root for her. When she threw Jo's work in the fire, she just appeared as a witch. The love that these sisters have for one another never comes through. Plus, the scene where Amy is in school, and gets hit, she looks so out of place because she looks too old. I never felt anything for her. She just comes across as a spoiled, entitled brat. Laurie and Friedrich were cast too young. Especially when they shared the scene with one of the sisters. The mother, Mary March, says that she spent nearly 40 years working on her temper. There is no way that Laura Dern looks 30ish. The camera did a close-up when she said this, and all of Laura's wrinkles and neck was in full display. The ending, when Jo and the editor turned to talk to the camera, was ... cringy. It was so out of place. So too was the scene when Freidrich came by Jo's house, and she turned around and faced her family, then they raced to the train station. The movie got so corny towards the end. ",

I won't say that about her take on \"Little Women\", a telling of the classic that gives her plenty of space to deliver a very beautiful film.\n\nSaoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, and Laura Dern, are just part of this critically successful cast that walks us through the path of the March sisters as they grow up and make life changing decisions through the good times and the bad.\n\nThe material is no trouble for this group of all stars, but Gerwig paints us a beautiful period piece that makes this world both happy and world when needed, as well as cold and devastating as our characters move along. There are some wonderful shots that moves us through fancy French parties and Christmases in the March household with little trouble.\n\nWhen you combine the talent that is everywhere in this film, along with the direction, there just isn't any space for this movie to fail. And I haven't even mentioned Meryl Streep.\n\nOf course, this story won't be for everyone and it's not \"The Fast and Furious\", you're going to have to work with this film's slower pace.\n\nBut if you have the patience, I think you'll find \"Little Women\" to be quite enjoyable and that really falls on Gerwig.",

The visuals are great, mostly, but the story is told out of order to try to group the emotional moments together (?) and draw parallels. This not work for a couple reasons - it destroys the character development... we know that Jo declined Teddy before it happens and that Jo likes to dance with a man. The make-up (or lack there of) makes it difficult to follow when was 'present' and when was 'past.' While there is a 7 year span covered all the actors appear to be the same age the whole time. And while the performances were fine is a bit understated it was hard to believe that Beth was on death's door.  On the other hand script and performance of Aunt March is an improvement on the 1994 version - which I much prefer on every other aspect except the lovely expansive visuals and Aunt March.",

It was a feel-good (mostly) heart-felt story with (mostly) attractive actresses and heart-felt true-to-life emotionality/sentiment. It was definitely a tale of sentiment and sensibility a la Jane Austen. I would say it was most like her Pride and Prejudice in terms of mood and content and characters. There was tremendous sympathy and understanding to the point that even fairly insensitive guys should be able to connect with the lead characters. Joe was a lot like Elizabeth Bennet. I liked the way intellectual and artistic (painting and musical) pursuits were treated with respect.  Note also that the general foci of historical fiction was inverted in this case so that what is usually found in the foreground, the war, receded into the background and what was usually in the background, the domestic life, moved to the foreground. Incidentally the tragedy involving scarlet fever was similar to what my dad experienced as a boy though he survived and lived to the age of 82.",

Jo settled for some professor we don't even know and for some reason Laurie and Amy ended up together. My mother also found all the flashbacks very confusing. This is not a powerful or original film.

On the negative side, this film jumped around between flashbacks and it is often hard to know where you are in the storyline even for a true fan let alone my father who was a trooper in seeing this film over something with more fire power. Greta is a brilliant writer but the cinematic direction lacked detail and moments of quiet where the actions of the characters could speak for themselves. I was very displeased with the last 15-20 mins. Felt it was written with an inside joke/ or on a cultural note of today without being true to the novel.

From what I heard, the ending was supposed to be different from the original \u2014 Greta Gerwig supposedly gave Jo the ending she would have liked. I don't see how \u2014 she still gets married to the immigrant professor she meets in New York.

This is not something that other adaptations have missed. And there are some big problems with Amy. In what world would they have the same adult actress play the 12 year old girl. It just does not make sense. And there are very pivotal scenes with Amy and Beth, where you just do not care, and I was shocked at how those plots were not developed.

Case-in-point reviewer from WSJ refers to Mr. Laurence as Laurie's father (he's his grandfather.) The movie is very hard to follow unless you know the book/previous movies. Their relationships and interactions are far too contemporary/modern. It's missing the chemistry in the relationships - that of the sisters (key!), Marmee and the girls and romances. Completely shocking with all these A-list actors. Seeing roots Demarcation in Marmee's hair in the first scene was a distraction out of the gates. Casting was odd overall. Very little character development. Jo was the best character. Emma Watson's Meg had some nice moments, too. She had inconsistently in her accent. Which is a bugger. Too much telling - not enough showing. It was a little preachy at a few spots - which was an unnecessary addition to drive home feminist slant of the story that tells that on it's own merits. There were parts that were very visually rich. The soundtrack got better about 1/2 way through.",

I'm sure those who know the classic novel's story by heart will more likely immediately love the playful tweaking by screenwriter/director Gerwig, though, and I enjoyed and appreciated her adaptation technique much more when I saw the film again a week later. Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern and Timothee Chalamet are standouts, but really everyone featured here has their shining moments. One noticeable thing that bugged my best friend and I:  we saw and heard absolutely nothing that kept this from being rated \"G,\" and it would've added to the quiet joy of an escape from modern snark this film is to have been one of the very few \"G\"-rated grown-up films made in recent decades.

And personally I really like 2018 modern version.\n\nLikes:  Laura Dern as Marmee .  Emma Watson as Meg.  \n\nTimothee Chalamet is perfect as Laurie.  Best of any version.  He is Larie from the book.\n\nMeryl Streep as Aunt March of course.\n\nI liked how it showed Amy always being in love with Laurie and how he falls in love with her, instead of just suddenly they are married.\n\nI thought it gave better depth to the characters.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nThe timeline jumps around.  It would be hard to follow if you haven't read the book multiple times.\n\nProfessor Brehr is too young.\n\nAmy isn't pretty or flighty enough.\n\nBeths character is not as fleshed out as the others so her importance to the family is lost.  And there is no death scene for Jo and Beth. You just see jo and marmee crying and then standing at the burial.\n\nWierd juxoposition of jo and an editor and makes it seem more like her imagining/writing a fictional story, then the characters living the story.\n\nOveral, its good...but not magical.",

For some difficult to characterize reasons, Emma Watson did not warm up to the character she played (a frequent complaint), while the other sister actresses did so easily. The only person I thought was miscast was Chris Cooper, mostly because his voice and manner of speaking were jarring and did not seem to blend in easily in the late 1800's setting, although his role was supporting not a frequent distraction. Saoirise should easily get nominated for best actress (probably with Margot Robbie for Once ... in Hollywood), and Laura for supporting actress. I will probably see it again in the next week.

The characters I just recently came to know and love in the first book are beautifully portrayed by the four actresses in the title roles. Charming and heartwarming, the film shines the brightest when the performers effectively and heartfeltly showcase the central relationships of the book (sisterly, romantic, and platonic). A solid supporting cast, beautiful visuals, and a sincere tone throughout round out some of the many positives of this film. \n\nI do have one negative aspect of the film to mention. My mother, who has never read the book, was understandably confused with some events of the film. Structurally, the film frequently bounces between the events of the first book, and seven years later (which is the focal period of time of the film). If you find yourself easily confused with stories that frequently bounce between events in time like this, I would advise that you at least read the first third of the eponymous book. This helped me immensely during the film (it's also a fantastic read anyway). If you neither have the will or the time to read it, I believe you will still get much from the film.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend lovers of the book, period-piece viewers, and anyone with a palate for a heartfelt story about a loving family to see this film. It is deserving of the praise it is getting.",

Another beauty worthy beholding is Alexandre Desplat's beautiful score that paints a beautiful soundscape for the characters' journey.
