When his second-in-command, Officer Dixon -- an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence -- gets involved, the battle is only exacerbated.",

            "content": "McDonagh is a master of style and atmosphere but here I feel he was out of his element tackling distinctly American social issues ultimately too big to receive proper treatment as filaments in a muddled tapestry. As a result there are several ham fisted attempts to beat the audience bluntly over the head in order to point out themes which the thoughtful viewer should already have been aware were boiling in the background. A well made film from every technical and artistic angle which I felt failed to deliver any meaningful message, unlike masterpieces Bruges and Banshees, which exhibit what McDonagh is capable of on more comfortable turf. Likewise, where Seven Psychopaths succeeded due to its willingness to not take itself seriously, here McDonagh attempts to expand on his foothold of Americana by injecting the more emotional elements of his typical work into that violent wacky comedic framework - and fails to bridge the gap.",

Her character is multi-faceted, initially coming across as unyielding, but as the plot unfolds, her actions reveal a sense of childlike desperation as she seeks answers for the act.\n\nThis movie boasts a powerful plot that delves into a range of issues, such as race, morality, rape, domestic violence, and the painful grief associated with murder. However, despite the dark nature of the story, the film injects rare but dry humor into the mix, creating moments of levity amidst the emotional fallout.\n\nAbove all, \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing\" is a captivating exploration of mid western small-town America. The plot is gripping, the humor is sharp, and the performances are top-notch.",

            "content": "The fictional town of Ebbing, Missouri takes centre stage in Martin McDonagh's gritty story of one mother's quest for justice in this intense crime drama. The film has been decades in the making, when McDonagh was first inspired by accusatory billboards in 1998, asking about the murder of a woman named Kathy Page. Assuming the billboards were put up by Kathy's mother inspired McDonagh, combined with his desire to create strong female characters. Academy Award winner Frances McDormand leads a talented cast that includes Woody Harrelson, Sam R ockwell, Peter Dinklage, and Lucas Hedges.\n\nSeven months after the rape and murder of her daughter Angela, Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is frustrated with the lack of progress in finding her daughter's killer and decides to take matters into her own hands. She rents three billboards near her home as a way to ask the police department why no progress has been made in the investigation, calling out police chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) by name. As expected, the billboards rattle the population of Ebbing, with Mildred being harassed daily, but one person takes particular issue with the billboards, Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell). As tensions in the small town grow, Mildred begins taking extreme risks to ensure justice is served, but will her determined efforts be successful, or will her daughter's murder remain unsolved?\n\nFrances McDormand's Oscar-winning performances is arguably one of the actress' best turns in recent years. She portrays the grieving mother as the impulsive and resolute woman she is, creating a character that audiences can really sink their teeth into. Sam Rockwell brings the complex character of Jason Dixon to the screen, earning the \"Moon\" actor his first Academy Award. Rockwell's turn as the controversial police officer makes for one of the film's many highlights, even more so during an intense one take scene in which Dixon goes on a rampage which him violently throwing Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones) out of a window. The powerful performances from McDormand and Rockwell are joined by a marvellous turn from Woody Harrelson as the Ebbing police chief, and a criminally underused Peter Dinklage.\n\nWriter and director Martin McDonagh creates an impressive screenplay that perfectly balances the film's hilarious black comedy with intense and emotional drama. However, the film's ending can't help but feel like a little bit of a let-down, as if McDonagh couldn't figure out how to end the film or if he just gave up, leaving audiences to guess what happened. Cinematographer Ben Davis (\"Eternals\", \"Cry Macho\") crafts gorgeous visuals, and combined with the crisp editing, courtesy of \"In Bruges\" editor Jon Gregory make \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" an extremely enjoyable visual experience, even if you're not invested in the story.\n\nIf it wasn't obvious from the film's premise, \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is a searing story about how far a woman will go to get the justice she deserves, with Mildred turning to burning down the police station in order to get her message across. However, the fact that Mildred had to put up the accusatory billboards is potentially a testament to how, sometimes, the police can be lazy when it comes to investigating certain cases, which can be backed up by the fact that Sam Rockwell's Officer Dixon doesn't take his job seriously, with the character reading comics and messing about until he's fired.\n\nMartin McDonagh delivers a tour de force with this 2017 crime drama. Showcasing knockout performances from both Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell, the film tells a harrowing story of one woman on her quest to get justice for her daughter's brutal rape and murder. With McDonagh's next directorial effort \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" set to be released later this year, we can only hope that the British-Irish director's skills transfer effectively from this gritty drama to a 1920s comedy drama set in Ireland.",

It's a beautifully constructed script, character and plot beats paced out with subtle precision; and it looks subtly beautiful, cinematography, colour and lighting coalescing to haunting effects. It feels redundant to say that Frances McDormand is superb; at this point in her career, she's an actor whose excellence is guaranteed. It's also more than a little influenced by the crime dramas of the Coen brothers - in tone, plot and much else, it's easy to imagine this as one of theirs. All the characters in this film feel as if they're trapped in a situation they want out of but can't navigate the way, their solutions are always just out of reach. It's as melancholy as it is funny, and it's never short of compassionate human insight.",

            "content": "Pretentious and melodramatic, could've been far better if the director had dialled it down a couple of notches.\n\nI finally got around to watching this film and ended up being disappointed.  The set-up is terrific: the billboards, the unspeakable crime, the victim's mother and her implacable anger. Woody Harrelson brings complexity to his portral of the besieged police chief and you're all set for a deeply satisfying tense portrait of the effects of this tragedy on the members of the town, or so you think....\n\nThere are those moments in a a book or movie that strike a wrong note and you discount them - maybe it was just me? - then another one happens and another....  The wrong notes for me were the characters doing things that real people simply don't do.  When the police chief confesses to the bereaved mother that he has cancer her bitter callous response is shocking.  Hmm, okay so she's a REAL hardarse. Then she attacks and mutilates the dentist because he suggests she should take the billboards down.  This is almost played for laughs but it's okay because....he's fat? And therefore ridiculous and so it doesn't really matter if he's mutilated because of a careless remark.  It gets worse, no one seems to care that she did this, certainly not the police, they seem to think he had it coming.  Police departments simply do not work like this. Later when a cop smashes windows and almost kills a citizen - right across the road from the police station whats more - passersby seem to barely notice, certainly not the new hot shot cop in town who seems only mildly interested.  There is no outcry, his fellow officers don;t rein him him in which they would do even for there own sakes so as not to bring themselvs into disrespect. However the new hot shot cop does get to deliver some cool lines in a a cartoonish exchange that had me nearly rolling my eyes at the absurdity of it.\n\nI diagnosed what I think is the problem fairly early on. Director McDonagh is Irish and as an outsider has learned what he knows about America by watching movies and TV shows and to me lacks the subtlety and understanding of the culture he seeks to examine. Like fellow theatre director Sam Mendes' patronising American Beauty he trades in egregious stereotypes - the stupid racist white cop, the cool black lieutenant, the drunken toothless hick mother  - but  presents it as if he's giving you the \"real deal\" on the \"real America\". \n\nThe theatre background explains a lot, everything is turned up to 11 all the time, McDonagh needed to ease it back and give the actors and material some space.  It came across like a Tarantino movie at times - \"pointless sadistic violence is cool! It doesn't even really hurt!\" - and Wild at Heart era David Lynch with city actors portraying small town people as a bunch of two-dimensional yokels.  You can see McDonagh is trying to avoid cliches and stock characters but what he ends up doing is taking stock characters to begin with and then simply making them to unlikely things.  \n\nI'm not even American and I found it patronising and ultimately quite silly.",

This film takes place in a small town and for a film that was released in 2017 the dialogue consists of a lot of risky things, things that most people are scared to say. But that's whats so great about it, they go for it and don't hold back so you get these very open characters that don't care what they say and it makes for some extremely good scenes. \n\nThe lead character Mildred played by Frances McDormand is this foul mouthed, broken but fearless mother, that doesn't take smack from anyone. Frances is phenomenal as this character and gives one of the best performances I've seen in a more modern film. Woodie Harrelson and Sam Rockwell are also extremely good in their respective roles. Although he wasn't in it much I enjoyed the scenes involving Peter Dinklages character, made for some hilarious moments.\n\nMartin McDonagh the writer and director is incredible, she sets up this town extremely well and gives us some great cinematography along with it. \n\nThe film is also unpredictable, I kept thinking I knew what was going to happen next but was very surprised when what happened wasn't what I expected. \n\nIf you are a legitimate movie fan you will enjoy this film. The way it dives into the setting and the characters is extremely well done and entertaining. If you are looking for more of a action filled fun ride I'd probably skip this one. \n\nMy one gripe with the film is the ending. I was extremely invested in Mildred and when the film ended although I don't think it's a bad ending, I was hoping for something a little more neat. I wish they could've given us just one more scene to rap it up just a little better. But all in all an incredible film.\n\n9.5/10",

Three Billboards does its best, and although the subject matter is bleak ( A desperate divorced mother bankrolling an ad campaign to find her daughter's killer) McDonagh's incredible ability to weave such blatant black humour around the narrative is spellbinding.

            "content": "So the best way to watch this movie is to not know what it's about \u2014 it's one of those that's best served unknown and just let the film take you for the ride. All you need to know is that it's got a dream cast of Francis McDormand, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell. All three of these actors are top notch, and I'll go out o my way to see a most movies that any of these three are billed in. \n\nAlso, this is the most Coen Brothers' movie that the Coen Brothers didn't make. It clearly pulls a TON of inspiration from the likes of Big Lebowski, No Country for Old Men, and especially Fargo, just without the snow. \n\nI love Francis McDormand. She's easily one of my top three favorite actresses of all time, and this just might be my favorite role of hers. She plays a hardened and grieving mother who lost her daughter to a murder/rape. And throughout the whole movie, you can see her pain, but also her anger. And all she has to live for is to see justice brought down on whoever committed the crime against her poor young daughter. \n\nAnd it's the type of film that's filled with colorful characters who are all connected to this tragedy in one way or another. And it's also the kind of movie where no one in particular is the bad guy. I mean, Sam Rockwell does play a loose cannon of a cop, but as Woody Harrelson, as the chief, keeps saying, he's a good guy at heart. Now, I love this movie, but there's no proof or byline that actually suggests that Dixon is good in any way. \n\nThroughout the movie he proves to be a racist buffoon who fights unfairly and just has a big chip on his shoulder. He does some things in this movie that in real life, he would have been arrest for, yet he gets discharged for a very small offense. So that would be my problem with the movie, is that it's not consistent with the Sam Rockwell's character of Dixon. \n\nDon't get me wrong, Rockwell is great in his role. He convinces me that he really is a lowlife who needs to be socked in the teeth, but I feel like he's written too conveniently to help the story along where it needs to go. \n\nNow, despite there being a dark shadow looming over this movie, what with the rape and murder of Mildred's daughter and Chief Willouby's terminal cancer, and the personal pain that every character is dealing with in their own lives, it's still a funny movie. There are unexpected punchlines, and brilliant comedic timing. And perhaps that's WHY the jokes work in this movie, because they contrast so much with the otherwise dour mood of this film. \n\nThere's a scene where Mildred, Frances McDormand, walks into her house and she's all, \"Hey, Robbie, I think that midget wants to get in my pants. Father Montgomery.\" And there's the priest sitting in her kitchen. Her line delivery and shock was just perfect. \n\nWoody Harrelson as the police chief, is just great as usual. He plays it both tough and friendly. He finds such a great balance, especially while his character is dealing with dying soon and his good name being being borderline slandered because of what's written on the billboards. \n\nAgain, there's no real antagonists in this movie, and usually when a movie is devoid of antagonists, that means that it's got complex characters in its place, and that's exactly what this movie has. These are usually the best types of movies, because complex characters, like real people, are often unpredictable, and unpredictability goes a long way in making a great movie. \n\nAnd because this is a better movie than most, it even goes into the backstory of Mildred's failed marriage, and she comes face-to-face with her abusive husband who's dealing with his grief in his own way by driving fancy cars and banging 19 year olds.\n\nI'm not ashamed to admit, I relate to Mildred. Thankfully I haven't lost a child, but life has turned me against people and made me calloused in a lot of ways. I'm not as outspoken as her, or as condescending, but she really has a tender heart. She flips a cockroach over that's stuck on its back, she admires the beauty and purity of a wandering deer in the field and she talks to it. \n\nI'm usually cranky most days because I'm not where I thought I'd be in my life. I'm working on it, but yeah, I've got anger issues. However, I'll bring home lost kittens and swerve out of the way of a bird in the road. My daughter and I buried a dead mole we found outside just a few weeks ago. \n\nSo yeah, I related to Mildred. And I think everyone will find a character to relate to in this movie, that's how diverse the characters are. \n\nNow, as great of an actor as Woody Harrelson is, I don't think he does voice over very well. After he kills himself the rest of the movie sort of relies on him reading his separate suicide notes to each person in his life, and he has no inflection or charisma in his voice. It's as though he got mad that he wasn't in the rest of the movie, and he didn't want to be relegated to just a voice, so he didn't put much effort into it. That's just a little nitpick, nothing major. \n\nAnd you know who's a delight in this movie? Peter Dinklage! Yes, he's in this. Now, I don't watch Game of Thrones, but I loved him in Elf. And he brings so much charm and humor to this movie. His last line delivery is so emotional and raw, that he comes dangerously close to outshining the his three costars. \n\nFun side note. I worked with and became pretty good friends with a guy who roomed with Peter Dinklage when he lived in New York jumping from audition to audition. My friend talked about Pete saying that he worked hard, hardly ever slept, and never gave up until he made it. I think that's really cool that he knew someone before he became a super mega star. And I think it's even cooler that a mega star like Peter Dinklage still showed up for an almost thankless role in this movie, but you've got to wonder if even he saw how great it was by reading the script. \n\nNow this movie has the most ambiguous of endings. It's no mystery, per say, but it just sort of ends before the grand adventure begins. I know there won't be a sequel, but I would have loved to get another 25 minutes where we got to see Mildred and Dixon hunt down the rapist together. \n\nAnd if there were a sequel, I'm sure it would be about the aftermath of Mildred and Dixon murdering the rapist in Idaho and his family would demand their arrest, and that movie would be called Three Billboards Outside McCall, Idaho. \n\nBut I'm not going to be bemoan an ambiguous ending \u2014 I'll leave that for everyone else. Because this movie was good enough as is. We should be so lucky that a movie this simple, yet great is in existence. \n\n\nAnd now it's time to rate this movie. I think it's pretty clear that I'm going to give this a very high rating. So far I haven't loved, or really even liked any of the movies I've reviewed for Should You Watch It?, but even if I'd been watching movies that I love, this would still rank significantly high. Now keep in mind that as I rank more movies, the scale will grow from 1-10 to 1-20 and so on. But as of now, until I come across something that's even better than this, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri gets the top slot at first place. I'm rating it a 1. \n\nYou can find me on YouTube, just type in Should You Watch It?

Because the author has combined the scriptwriter and director in himself and saw the idea as clearly as possible. As a result, we get ground-breaking drama.\n\nIt is especially worth noting the play of the actors. You have to watch this film at least for its cast: Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and my favourite actor - Woody Harrelson. Two of this 3 won an oscars for this film: for lead acting (Frances McDormand) and supporting acting (Sam Rockwell)\n\nIn my opinion, this is a really gripping and thought-provoking film with unexpected ending, which is based on a deep thought: 'Anger breeds anger'.",

The cinematography is also beautiful, as is the score. The pacing is fantastic too. All that is without even mentioning the cast, who are outstanding.\n\nWhat a terrific performance from Frances McDormand, who I always remember from 1998's 'Madeline' - one of the first films I recall watching at a young age.

Small town where everyone knows everyone, country as fuck, and possible corruption looming within the police department really helped this movie.\n5.The humor. Many funny moments provided by the three leads. Great balance even though the subject is dark.\n6. Caleb Landry Jones as a racist, sexist, or scum bag is undefeated in cinema.\n7. Lucas Hedges just cause.\n\nTHE BAD\n1. The connection to the daughter.

Unhappy with the progress of local police investigations, Mildred paints three unmistakable billboards reading, \"RAPED WHILE DYING,\" \"STILL NO ARRESTS?\" and, \"HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?\" Tensions quickly rise between Mildred and Chief Willoughby as the pair attempts to navigate their undoubtable chemistry mixed with their professional dissatisfactions with one another.\n\n\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27'\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1e: This is one of my favorite academy recognized films of the decade. The cast is loaded with remarkable actors delivering peak performances, as is evident by the film's Oscar nominations and victories. Consider this: the only reason Harrelson didn't win Best Supporting Actor is because his co-star Rockwell won the award for his performance in the same movie. McDormand waltzed into a Best Actress victory with an on-screen presence that is incontestably at the highest level of acting. In my opinion this was one of the biggest Best Picture snubs in Oscars history due to an academy nod at the creative, niche (and, in my opinion, entirely overrated) film \ud835\ude1b\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude30\ud835\ude27 \ud835\ude1e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33.

McDormand and Rockwell both received Oscars for their performances while Harrelson was nominated. These characters take this film's compelling story and sell it tactfully and beautifully. The mastery of the directing and cinematography makes for a very gripping motion picture. Overall, the only qualm I can nitpick with this film is the unsatisfying ending. The intensity and drama of the entire film leads us down a path towards what could be an amazingly satisfying ending, to only leave us wanting a few minutes more. However, with that being stated, the ending is left open enough for us, as the audience, to create our own ending for the film.

Frances McDormand is Mildred Hayes, a Missouri woman who rents three billboards to call attention to the local police and the town for the unsolved rape and murder of her daughter. Woody Harrelson is the police chief and target of her wrath. Sam Rockwell is a racist police officer with a penchant for brutality. McDonagh presents the material as a black comedy, but there are almost no laughs here and the movie comes across as callous and glib. McDormand said she based her performance on John Wayne, but she's playing a single-minded, humorless Wayne mixed with a vindictive Charles Bronson. Mildred acts smugly in a way that really made me resent the contempt the filmmakers show for the audience. The redemption of Rockwell rings false and the fate of Harrelson is melodramatic. Of the three main actors, only Harrelson is convincingly able to bring out his character's humanity. Won Oscars for Best Actress (Frances McDormand), Supporting Actor (Sam Rockwell).

It wasn't boring, self serving or pointless. The characters were well written, the actors were superb and the performances Oscar worthy.\n\nWhere it loses me a bit is that, at the end of the film, the only thing those 3 billboards did was aggravate the police and get 2 people seriously injured. If you came into the movie wanting there to be police corruption in the murder of the girl, there was none. If you came into the film hoping the killer would be caught because of the billboards, you'll be disappointed. The police aren't what they seem and the main \"bad\" guy is a reckless drunkard cop with a serious superiority complex. Even Woody Harrelsen's character, the Sheriff isn't a crooked cop.\n\nSo in the end you find yourself asking yourself who was the antagonist in this film? Who do you root for? For a film about 3 billboards, I was hoping they would have gotten some answers. Perhaps them being for the most part ineffective was the point of them in the main plot - that sometimes murders take time to solve, and as hurt and desperate you may become, sometimes the police did everything they could do. Sometimes the police aren't the bad guys.\n\nOverall, if you can put the billboards aside, as they start the plot moving but become more ineffective as the film progresses, there is enough emotion, gripping dialogue and tension to easily make this one of the better films of this nature released in the last few years. It doesn't rely on a big budget and special effects to drive it forward - the performances are enough to keep you hooked.",

It's a film much like the, often focused on, tied back undercut of Frances McDormand's hair; it very much presents two diametrically opposed things at once, one on top, one underneath and it lets us feel the way we want about them. Frances' Mildred may very well have been crazy before her daughter was killed, we don't know as we're mercifully and brilliantly dropped in months into her grieving process. People don't generally write slice of life films like this unless they're true stories, which intensifies the proof of skill writer/director Martin McDonagh has with writing nuanced, balanced, flawed characters. He manages, from his background writing plays, to not waste a single scene, there is not one moment in this film that doesn't bleed into another at some point and every moment gives weight to the next in the kind of suspense, surprise and momentum that other films just dream of having. The film uses its small microcosm of Ebbing, Missouri, and it's small incomplete story, to subvert film cliches effortlessly. There's a moment where Woody Harrelson coughs blood in the middle of a tough interrogation scene and the artificiality of his demeanour and that moment is just killed dead; his face shocked like a little boy's, his subject actually instantly taking pity on him. I've seen this in real life, I've never seen a moment like this in film, a construct built on artificiality, to use that construct to break it, just to show how human these human-like artifices are, is as close to magic as cinema gets. What am I talking about? I mean, I know, do you? And if you do, can you explain it to the next guy, cos I can't.",

The characters are really well done, some of them are too easy to hate but at the same time you feel shame and even empathy for them, they are not just predictable characters that you know how they are going to end, instead you feel like they really exist because unfortunately this difficult situation could happen in real life. And finally I love this movie for the performance of the protagonist, she reach what the movie needed, she showed a clear and strong case of female empowerement, because whichever way you see the situation about the protagonist she was in disadvantage but she was full of anger and frustration so the only thing she was looking for was to do visible the negative position in what the women of her town find themselfs.

During the movie I laughed hard and often, and then I cried, and wince, and laughed again all almost the same time.\nFrom my point of view, the dialogue and the screenplay were amazing, well connected to the space, to the characters in fact to the story itself. I am a hundred percent sure that this movie can make you realize if you are doing something wrong with your loved ones, if you are not taking care of yourself enough, even if you are wasting your time and you are not enjoying the life.\nThe only think I don't like so much was the name, in my perspective it's a little clich\u00e9 and literal, however if you see it for first time it's pretty obvious and maybe ingenious, but can make you feel stupid. \nI send my congratulations to the directors, to the producer, the writers all the team in general for do an excellent work and show us a little part of how real life works and how people suffers.\n",

            "content": "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a film directed by Martin McDonagh known for other great films like Seven Psychopaths and In Brudges. The film came out on 2016 and has been regarded as a cult classic ever since. It tells the story of Mildred, a mother of two whose daughter had been murdered and raped; as there is a lack of interest from the local police on the murder of her daughter she decides to take justice in her own hands and push the police to restart the investigation in the form of three billboards with messages against the chief of the town. Little does she know that everything will go off the rails from there\u2026.\nThe movie on itself is a pretty worthwhile experience, there is plenty of good acting, specially from the main leads played by Frances McDormand (in probably her best performance to date) and Sam Rockwell. Their characters, despite having differences on their perception of justice, manage to deliver a solid and believable hate relationship that evolves in such a natural scheme that you find yourself astonished on how almost perfectly everything plays out for them at the end of the film.\nThere is always a feeling of unpredictability to it, you never know where the story is going to go, you could certainly say that most of the movie is composed of plot-twists but it is mind-blowing to know that they don't feel forced at any moment as the story progresses with a pretty light pace without feeling over-stuffed during its whole runtime.\nThe technical aspects are breathtaking, McDonagh proves to be a masterful director once again with a familiar story that takes a bizarre approach to its subject matter. There is plenty to enjoy from masterful directing to a beautiful soundtrack composed of country and classic music that turns Three Billboards into a remarkable craft.\nMotherhood, vengeance, redemption and regret are only a handful of the themes touched in Three Billboards. The emotional parts hit you hard most of the time because everything about it feels so authentic, it is an authentic work of passion.\nConclusion: Three Billboards is probably the best movie to come out on 2017 and its impact will remain as one of the most heartbreaking black comedies of the decade, the conflict feels real and the characters, the heart of the film, make it worth a watch.",

I had high expectations upon watching this movie mainly because I was aware of the huge acclaim the movie has received and I also think Frances McDormand is one of the best actresses in movies today.  Upon seeing this movie I was impressed by the very strong performances mainly from Frances McDormand (Very good, but not deserving of an Academy Award as she was for \"Fargo\" in my opinion.) and Woody Harrelson as the struggling police chief of Ebbing.  On the other hand, I was not all that impressed.  I understand the motivation of McDormand's character Mildred Hayes.  She is distraught and angry over the brutal murder of her daughter and is angry that her killer or killers have not been brought to justice.  When people get into situations as these they tend to loose all civility and act erratically.  I would not mind that so much if the people in Ebbing were not so intently awful.  I also don't get how a police officer can damage property and throw people out of windows with dozens of people witnessing the event and the police officer is not held accountable for it in any way.  Also Mildred can commit arson and get away with it.  It just could not buy it try as I may.  In the end, I think the movie is well made and acted, but rather overrated.",

            "content": "I mildly enjoyed In Bruges (2008) instead of loving it as some people do and I had the same experience with this film. It was good, definitely, and yes I found it's treatment of Sam Rockwell's character a little odd but I would not have given it a Best Picture nomination. Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson give great performances and the screenplay contains some real gems which are the main reasons why you should watch this film. I wanted slightly deeper exploration of certain characters' motives and backstories and I would have liked it if the lead character was less one note but unfortunately this was not to be. Not the most memorable film in the world but features a lot of great talent collaborating and is very watchable despite being about some graphically violent subject material.\n\nMildred Hayes, Frances McDormand, has grown increasingly frustrated over the lack of progress in the investigation of the rape and murder of her daughter Angela. She places three billboards emblazoned with accusatory statements in a field leading into their town and comes into conflict with the town's reasonable police chief William Willoughby, Woody Harrelson, who is dying of cancer. Volatile, racist Officer Jason Dixon, Sam Rockwell, assaults the homosexual man who allowed Mildred to place the billboards but when tragic circumstances lead to the loss of an important figure Mildred and Dixon will have to unite.\n\nAt the beginning of the film it was easy to empathize with the lead character's anger and righteous indignation but the introduction of the flawed but sympathetic Willoughby made the film more layered. We see him as a family man and I fully expected him to be the rapist and killer based on this portrayal but when a shocking twist of another nature occurs I felt quite emotional. Harrelson is a great actor, as shown by The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and his brief role in The Thin Red Line (1998), and here he is likable and affable while still seeming like a jaded police chief. The scenes in which he interacts with his family felt mawkish but this was mainly McDonagh's direction and the character serves as a nice counterbalance to the main character.\n\nMcDormand is very good in her role as an angry, aggrieved woman but I wanted to see some moments of her relenting or being slightly less than extremely angry. The main character journey in the film is that of Dixon as we see his efforts to track down Angela's murderer become more concerted after he survives a raging fire. This development could work in a film that feels less sentimental but the treatment of his character initially, as a comical racist, makes it strange when we are meant to emotionally invest in his character changing. Obviously he faced serious physical damage but we never see any mental repercussions for his assault of a gay man and when they are placed together in the hospital I did not pity him. Although the final scene is entertaining and suggests that Mildred will be fulfilled I didn't think it should have been as cut and dry as it was when we are meant to see him through new eyes.\n\nMcDonagh's direction is assured and the film is paced well despite most scenes ending with Mildred physically abusing someone. The straightforward attitude that McDonagh takes to filmmaking is positive in this day and age where every filmmaker seems as though they are trying to be a young Christopher Nolan and uses non-linear storytelling. The colors of the film are fresh and vibrant with red being the dominant color and the image of the three billboards standing out starkly against the greens of the field. The score didn't have much impact when considering the fact that it received a Best Original Score Academy Award nomination but it's better to be irrelevant than extremely present and awful like in River's Edge (1986).\n\nThis is a decent film that you can watch with parents and friends but it's not worth paying extra for, try to catch it on television or on Netflix. I'm glad that this film finally earned Rockwell huge amounts of recognition but I'm not so hot on Vice (2018).",

            "content": "I can't even begin to describe the depths to which I hated this film - mostly because it was almost unanimously salivated upon by the mainstream of salaried media critics who couldn't have possibly been more automatic in their cultural gullibility.\n\nWhat you get in this albeit competently executed film (the acting is alright, the cinematography is sufficient), is a British playwright rummaging around American culture, trying to position himself as a purveyor of rural culture studies, then pulling the old trick of having absolutely nothing to say about it.  Seen by his gullible cultural elitist peers in media, this is an avant-garde move, sophisticated and edgy.  To normal people, it's a huge bore.  Speaking for myself, and estimating the reactions of sane people, we couldn't care less about a single character conjured up for this movie that's about nothing at all.  Frances McDormand has clearly gotten the aristocratic keys to the kingdom, and cannot do wrong:  critics have always fawned over every flinch she ever made, probably built on the good will of her public virtue-signalling, so there you have it.  Peter Dinklage is just thrown into this casting mix for a minor part, always lusting for the unlikely target of Frances, because...hey, look at him?  How woke is that?  And the cancerous sergeant's wife is just there to be pleasantly supportive, then vilified, and never relevant.  There is tone-deaf melodrama, virtue signalling, wink-wink irony, and operatic underscore dumped onto two spots, but absolutely nothing of value in this film (besides the currency of proclaiming you \"get it\" when there's nothing to get besides popularity).\n\nIt's one thing when major critics sell their souls and fawn over mainstream tentpole ultra-violent superhero movies.  Of course they have to, staying on payroll.  But when they drool on pretentiously banal drivel like this, it's a sign of creepy corruption in media.  Don't trust them, and don't read them.  Newspapers and magazines are dying off anyway.",

The only 2 things which griped me a bit was the moment with the CGI deer that broke the movie's immersion for me. CGI animals always break movie immersion for me when they clearly look out of place. Also, the ending... I wanted more of a cathartic crichendo, a bit more runtime to the movie, rather than the ambiguous happy-go-lucky trail-off which it delivered, although simultaneusly I can appreicate the way it did end, as it served as a good resolution between the two main characters. I could nitpick the movie a bit more also... such as the ex-husband's arc which I wanted more of a resolution to, such as him getting some punishment for his behaviour. The movie had touches of elements from The Hunt, which I would have liked to have seen more of an exploration of, but maybe that's the long-burn Deadwood/Firefly fan in me talking...",

In Martin McDonagh's Oscar-winning tragicomedy, we are treated to some very peculiar events in a fictional Missouri town, populated by extreme people (played by superstar actors).  The tone is comic but the content is dark, very dark - perhaps this allows us to face it more easily?  Frances McDormand plays a woman whose daughter was raped and murdered and who seeks to push the police to solve the case by putting up billboards to humiliate them.  Woody Harrelson is the police chief who is dying of cancer and stymied by the case.  Sam Rockwell is the not-too-bright but racist and hot-headed officer who butts heads with McDormand.  An assortment of excellent supporting players fill out the cast.  Each of the central figures follows an arc that shows some personal growth - and we are asked to contemplate how grief (and impending death) affect people.  McDormand and Rockwell show us some reactions.  Wittily, Harrelson attempts to foresee how others will react to his own death.  Although we may not get the ending that we hoped for (a good thing, perhaps), the film as a whole is refreshingly blunt (led all the way by McDormand's brash portrayal) and a setting/cast that could easily spin-off a quirky miniseries.

This helps keep the film focused while allowing the audience room to breathe around such a heavy topic. Frances McDormand is stunning in showing the unpredictability of a grieving mother. While not a stereotypically likeable character, McDormand is unbeaten in showing both the softer side and more destructive sides of Mildred Hayes, to the point where you are behind her even at her darkest moment. Sam Rockwell's character of Jason Dixon is also fascinating, the transition from racist cop to a seemingly redeemed character on the verge of vigilantism is done well, and in a way that almost makes you sympathetic towards him.

            "content": "I went to see 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri', directed by Martin McDounagh, on the 23rd of October 2018 at the Curzon theater in Oxfordshire and I was particularly impressed on how the director was able to achieve a heartwarming and thought provoking narrative through filming techniques - tackling mature subjects.\n\n\n\nOne thing to make clear off the bat. This was my second viewing and, therefore, this review will be written through the point of view of a second watch. The prior knowledge of story beats and character arcs allowed me to become more invested in the pacing, camera movement, and use of colour. As well as the compelling performances.\n\n\n\n'Three Billboards' follows the story of Mildred [Played by Frances McDormand] a grief stricken mother who places a message on three billboards in order to get a rise out of the police department to find the killer of her daughter. The Billboards themselves serve as powerful imagery in the film. The use of a colour, of a vibrant red, to emphasise the violence, hatred and passion associated with them and the use of words 'Raped whilst dying' add to an uncomfortable feel for both the audience and the police department. I was particularly impressed by how nature was used within this film. When Mildred feels hope for her plight, flowers blossom; animals are present to show the forces of nature support her actions. However, when Mildred is lost in despair the Billboards are surrounded by the uncertainty of fog, Mildred cannot see past this fog and cannot predict what may happen in the future. Finally, in times of  intense despair such as the Billboards catching fire or the fight with her son it is filmed at night - illuminating the darkness which represents the overall mood. Nature is cleverly used as a physical way to demonstrate Mildred's mood rather than it being explained through dialogue.\n\n\n\nMoreover, I was fascinated by the character of Dickson [Played by Sam Rockwell] a racist. immature, violent man. Martin McDonagh has cleverly constructed a deeply flawed character that the audience are able to empathize with based off his retribution and anagnorisis towards the end as well as his juvinle outlook on life. . To establish Dickson's violent tenancies McDonagh uses the colour of red to subconsciously imply his hatred and violence - in most scenes he's in there is a tint of red. Furthermore, the scene where Willoughby commits suicide is instantly juxtaposed by the lighthearted comic relief of Dickson dancing to ABBA completely oblivious to the outside world. McDonagh cleverly uses this editing technique to highlight Dickson's immaturity.\n\n\n\nHowever, one limitation associated with this film is the stereotype perpetuated within middle America that they are racist, homophobic, and dismissive of police duties. The issue of this is exacerbated by the knowledge that 'Three Billboards' is a British Film. This blatant stereotyping, although makes flawed characters which are interesting to watch, highlights either a scarce amount of research or an intentional insult. Saying this though, it was not something I noticed on my first viewing and is easily ignored based on the rest of the content.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, I want to discuss the ending of this film and the huge impact it had on me. The ending details Dickson and Mildred travelling together to kill a supposed rapist. Even throughout their dialogue it is clear that they are hesitant of carrying out with it. The film ends on a cliff hanger that will never be resolved - the audience don't get closure. And although some people may dislike this I think it directly contributes to the effect of the film. Not only does it allow the audience to have a more personal connection to Mildred as they too will never have closure but it causes the audience to think about the film after their viewing - to discuss its themes, its characters, its direction. And I think, considering the context of this film, that is incredibly important. The theme of this film is to never forget the tragedy and use it to develop as a person and grow. To not neglect your duty. As the police should not forget Mildred's daughter, neither should we. We should use this film as a guideline to react to crimes of that nature, to prevent it from ever happening in the future and McDonagh through character, pathetic fallacy, colour and structure show this perfectly.",

            "content": "I always seem to start these reviews with a bit of an aside and this aside will focus on Sam Rockwell.  Sam Rockwell is one of my favorite actors, personally.  I don't wanna say this without sounding like I'm insulting him, but he's also not one of the best actors I've ever seen.  And I really don't mean this as an insult, because I'm comparing him to, say, someone like a Daniel Day-Lewis, whose dedication to his craft and the characters he inhabits have made him the best I've ever seen.  Sam Rockwell isn't at that truly elite level, but he's only a few slight notches below that.  The thing about Sam is that, regardless of what type of role he has to play, he always delivers consistently great performances, even if the movie ends up being absolute shit.  He's one of those guys that I can watch in absolutely anything and I would be fine watching it because Sam Rockwell is in it.  There's very few actors I can say that for, at least in my own case.  Having said that, I felt that Rockwell was snubbed of an Oscar for his performance in Seven Psychopaths.  You don't know how fucking great this guy was.  Hell, he was even snubbed of a NOMINATION.  Like, seriously, watch Rockwell in Seven Psychopaths and tell me how he DOESN'T, at the very least, deserve a nomination.  That's not to say that I don't think Rockwell didn't deserve to win it for this movie, as he was fantastic in his portrayal of a troubled and violent cop, but in a way I think it's also to make up for not giving him that nomination for Seven Psychopaths.  I suppose it's not fair to talk about this movie and, quite frankly, not mention the absolutely amazing performance from France McDormand.  Another well deserved Academy Award win for an actress that, quite frankly, I think a lot of us sleep on.  And that's just a shame, because she is absolutely incredible and proves it once again in this movie with a layered, nuanced and beautifully angry performance as this hardened woman who seeks justice for her daughter's rape/murder by putting up three billboards putting Chief Willoughby on blast for not making any arrests in her daughter's case after seven months.  And, lastly, I have to talk about Martin McDonagh and his innate ability at drawing career-best performances out of the actors in his movies.  He did this for Colin Farrell in In Bruges (which I need to see again).  He did this for Rockwell in Seven Psychopaths.  And he did this again for McDormand (who's had a stellar career) and Rockwell again.  He truly is an actor's director and there's no way that can be denied.  And, obviously, his ability at writing incredible dialogue that tell stories that you immerse yourself in.  In short, as if it wasn't obvious, I absolutely loved this movie.  Sometimes, there's movies that you watch and you're like 'damn, this is why I love movies' and this is one of those.  And this is taking into consideration the fact that I HAVE seen better movies than this and, yet, for some reason or another, this makes me happy to love movies as much as I do.  Which is a strange thing to say about such a dark movie.  That's the thing, this movie isn't really afraid to go to some dark places in terms of exploring the relationship between Mildred and her daughter (that was contentious to say the least), Mildred's relationship to her son and Mildred's relationship to the town of Ebbing, who seem to turn their backs against her as a result of her actions.  Interesting ideas to explore, given that the town itself rallies around Chief Willoughby as a result of his cancer diagnosis.  In many ways, it reminds me of the whole deal with NFL players kneeling at the national anthem and people taking it as some sort of unpatriotic move disrespecting the memories of dead soldiers.  First of all, no soldier ever died for the anthem, let's get that straight.  Secondly, the fact of the matter is that these NFL players are standing up against injustices committed against the black community and these NFL players are just calling attention to that, where those responsible for these injustices do not pay for their crimes.  And that reminds me very much of the outcry the billboards cause around town.  Mildred isn't insulting Chief Willoughby or anything of the sort, she just wants answers for her daughter's rape and murder.  She hadn't heard anything from the cops in seven months until she put the billboards up.  Now they're all over her.  Things are further complicated when Chief Willoughby kills himself to avoid wasting away due to cancer and the town, unfairly, blames Mildred for adding more stress to his already precarious situation with her billboards.  As I already mentioned, the movie is impeccably written and cast, so in spite of potentially touching on some very touchy subjects, I think the movie does so with an incredibly adept touch that doesn't disrespect its characters or the situations it presents.  Having said that, this movie is also very funny.  Ironically enough, it's something like the Coens would make.  And I say ironically, because Frances McDormand is married to Joel Coen.  I'm not trying to suggest that this movie is, in any way, a ripoff of the Coen brothers, but you can see the similarities.  Martin McDonagh still has his own unique touch and wonderfully offensive dialogue that makes it stand out.  I love the character development in this movie.  Because Mildred gives off this vibe of being a tough, hardened woman and she really is, but you can tell that this is eating her up inside.  She is a woman that has been pushed to this point by the cops' inability to find the person culpable for this crime.  She's very vulnerable character and you get to see brief glimpses of that and it's great to see, because it shows you that Mildred, in spite of this vibe she gives off, is a woman that is really hurting.  But you can tell that she is a very caring woman as well, as given by her response to Willoughby after he accidentally coughs up blood in her face.  Or her scene when she talks to a deer.  Really great character and, obviously, amazing performance Frances to give live and heart to this person.  Willoughby is also an interesting character in that you can tell that he's a good man, that he feels for Mildred's situation and how he wishes he could find the one(s) responsible for what happened.  His suicide was also quite unexpected as well.  There's these scenes when Willoughby's wife, Dixon (Rockwell's character) and Mildred all read suicide notes that are all quite heartbreaking, lovely and funny all in equal measure.  I think his letter to Dixon is probably the best of them all as it really inspires a change in a man that, really, seemed to have no redeemable qualities.  He basically tells him to let go of the hate and embrace the love.  The movie also raises some interesting question, because Dixon comes across someone he thinks might be Angela's (Mildred's daughter) murderer, later in the film after he suffers severe burns as a result of Mildred burning down the police station.  He takes some DNA from the guy after purposely getting into a fight with him.  But, sadly, it turns out that he was not the guy.  Dixon apologizes to Mildred for getting her hopes up and then they set off on a journey to murder this man who is innocent of Angela's rape and murder specifically, but he is still a rapist.  And that brings an interesting question to mind as to whether, for Mildred at least, killing a rapist and, most likely, a murderer too, just not her Angela's rapist and murderer, would be enough to give Mildred (and Dixon, to an extent) some peace of mind.  Tough question to ask, really.  Well, there you have it.  I don't really think I can say much else about this movie.  I thought it was fantastic and it features some of the best acting you'll see from any film from 2017.  McDormand is out of this world.  Rockwell is incredible.  The rest of the cast is impeccable as well.  Writing is fantastic.  This has everything you could ask for and then some.  This is quite the easy recommendation.  It's that fucking great of a movie.",

Straight away, the most intriguing thing about this film is the characters. While the plot and visuals themselves seem exciting enough (huge explosions and beautiful cinematic filling the screen) McDonagh has clearly focused his time on developing his characters, and rightfully so. By struggling to pinpoint a clear protagonist and having one's empathy stretched to characters one would least expect, the audience is forced to recognise that no everything is black and white, making for an engaging viewing. With few words left to write I want to quickly focus on the importance of socially realistic films. While Three Billboards may not force its social message down the viewer's throat, it encourages conversation about topics that are not always the easiest to discuss. And even though I may have some issues with elements of the film, the conversations that will stem from it trump any of those issues.",

She knows how to stand her ground, and is quite rough around the edges. This was very fitting with the role her character has, the intensity of her character, and how we are supposed to sympathize with her. \nThis film has a lot of action and is a very intense watch. It includes rape, murder, suicide, adultery, domestic abuse, and long-term illnesses, challenging topics explored in the narrative. The convincing characters draw the audience into feeling very involved, and this consequently makes the plot more thought-provoking.\nI would highly recommend this film, but feel it is important to know that it is not a 'light watch' and will likely leave you feeling heavy-hearted and will provoke lots of thoughts and emotions.",

            "content": "I am a huge, HUGE fan of IN BRUGES, the marvelous movie from Martin McDonagh, who both wrote and directed 3 BILLBOARDS. It's got lots of violence and \"crime action\" with some really terrific anti-heroes, great dialogue presented by actors doing their best work (Colin Farrell has never been better), an off-kilter romance and nice plot twists and a dark-comedy \"happy\" ending. Great stuff.\n\nI also love Frances McDormand, and I think Sam Rockwell is a seriously overlooked & underestimated actor. So I was completely stoked to see this movie, and then so disappointed. I think more than anything, it shows that the delicate balancing act McDonagh had with IN BRUGES, where awful behavior from awful people could actually be made sympathetic and exciting, is harder to juggle than one might think.\n\nIn the film, McDormand plays a mother whose teen daughter has been murdered. She lives on the edge of a small Missouri town, and rents 3 nearby billboards and uses them to call out (in large letters) local law enforcement (particularly sheriff Woody Harrelson) for their lack of progress on her daughter's case. These anger billboards stir up major resentments throughout town, and McDormand responds with a level of vitriol that is a sight to behold. This part is perfect for her in so many ways...it's as though her OLIVE KITTERIDGE character has become an avenging angel. She's got such a great combination of smarts, sarcasm and foul-mouth. Yet when the script calls for moments of vulnerability, she nails those too, and can be pretty heartbreaking.\n\nRockwell is sensational, His role appears to be very skin-deep but he continues to evolve before our eyes, and his character progression ends up becoming the most interesting. He plays the role of a sheriff's deputy whose resentment for McDormand and his own seething anger at himself are all tangled up. And as the sheriff, Harrelson is convincing and often touching. Frankly, everyone is pretty darn good. Lucas Hedges, Peter Dinklage, Caleb Landy Jones and on and on. Everyone tears into their juicy parts with gusto.\n\nThe problem is the direction (and maybe the underlying script). Remember the balance I talked about with IN BRUGES? Well, it's all off here. Some bad things happen or people do bad things with really bad consequences. And it's not entertaining. We suddenly stop by sympathetic for people we were set up to root for. I suppose one could argue that the film shows how anger, resentment, revenge, etc. just never work out...but the film fails to demonstrate WHILE keeping our sympathy. The events of the story (rather than the characters) become too much, too mean-spirited. Towards the end, moments that should have been \"tear-jerkers\" are just hard to tolerate. Characters literally get away with things they shouldn't. As the plot unwinds, the plot turns feel unearned and arbitrary. McDonagh reveals a mean streak that's not terribly attractive or engaging.\n\nI suspect the film will be nominated for lots of awards, particularly for acting. And they are deserved. This is far from a terrible movie. But I also suspect many nominees will remain just that...nominees and not winners. (The best shot for a win is Sam Rockwell, and I'd be okay with that. He's pretty amazing in this film.) By all means see it...but not if you have delicate sensibilities. If you're okay with lots of people behaving badly, swearing a HUGE amount and things not working out like you'd prefer...you should find plenty to admire.",

It is still very much a Martin McDonagh film, you can tell by the way the characters speak to each other and the language that is used but this movie has a whole lot more heart behind it. It's a story about both forgiveness and revenge that finds Frances McDormand's character rent the 3 billboards of the title to goad the police into action regarding the death of her daughter.  I thought Frances McDormand was superb as was Sam Rockwell, playing a character so filled with rage and contempt for those around him who only through tragedy finds the person he could have been all along.

(During the last scene I personally found myself whispering to the characters Mildred and Dixon, \"Please come to your senses, make the correct choice!\")\n       I doubt that anyone who views this film will be able to be indifferent about what they have just witnessed. There are a few plot points that are questionable.. but overall, very effective.\n        For very personal reasons, from the few Oscar Best Picture nominees that I've seen,   I wish CALL ME BY YOUR NAME would pick up the statue for Best Picture, but it doesn't stand a chance.\n        Sam Rockwell is definitely going to win best supporting actor, he's a fantastic actor and it's a VERY showy role. (although I still think Michael Stuhlbarg should have been nominated and should have won the Oscar for best supporting actor for his amazingly beautiful/understated performance in CALL ME BY YOUR NAME).\n      I have no doubt Frances McDormand will win the Oscar for Best Actress and with her fierce uncompromising performance as Mildred Hayes, she probably deserves the award. The only thing is.. I still haven't seen THE SHAPE OF WATER and I always LOVE the work of Sally Hawkins. \n        If you haven't seen THREE BILLBOARDS.. do yourself a favor and go see it or rent it. However, if you are sensitive to strong violence and rough/foul mouthed language (McDonagh's dialogue makes playwright/screenwriter David Mamet's language seem tame) you may want to pass on THREE BILLBOARDS.\n         One final note: The scene with the deer still moves me immensely, no matter how many time's I've seen it (it's in the trailer for the film). It's a fantastic scene!",

No quantum entanglement can match the interaction between this indelible linkage. I have personally been blessed with witnessing this bond form recently when my daughter gave birth to her first child. The movie, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri', Is a poignant story that examines the amazing strength of maternal love and devotion. In a year where movies have broken box office records raking in billion-dollar profits for the studios, a film of this stature comes up on cinephiles quietly, apparently out of nowhere. Much of the attention paid by the media concentrated on the high-octane action/adventure movies many derived from the pages of comic books. It is true that the cinematic substance of this genre has improved to the point of qualifying many of these super hero films to rank among the best films of the year. Still, it remains an incredible experience to watch a movie crafted as a means of emotional expression. the story told by 'Three Billboards', dissects the most powerful emotions, hatred, prejudice, fear and love to produce a film that is enthralling, mesmerizing in its ability to capture the attention of the viewer and entirely command their full involvement in the lives and plights of the characters. It should come as little surprise that this film was produced by a division of a major studio devoted to providing deserved attention and recognition to independent films that would otherwise remain prominent only on the festival circuit. Fox Searchlight made it possible for the inciteful story to become nominated for the industry's highest honors including four nominations for the upcoming Academy Awards. The movie studios have realized that there is a lucrative market for independent films. While that decision was predominantly financial the result is bringing movies like this that previously were only available in select art house theaters. Typical of such films the best nature of indies is represented here, a story driven by a deep, unblinking exploration of humanity.\n\nMildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is a woman who is trying to survive an unimaginable pain, among the worse things possible. For any parent surviving your child is heart wrenching. As a mother Mildred is facing an impossible emotional trial, the rape and subsequent murder of her teenage daughter, Angela (Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand), was assaulted seven months ago and the perpetrator has yet to be brought to face justice. It is only human to lash out, seeking an emotional outlet for the anguish that is crushing down. This understandably natural but when a psychological component present, the feelings are greatly exacerbated. In this instance Mildred is certain that the authorities have not been fully vested in doing their job is pursing the murderer. The epicenter of her rage is the town's sheriff, Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), during the intervening seven months the investigation was stalled, no discernable progress was made heaping frustration on the already crushing grief and anger which has become Mildred's life. Deprived of any sense of normalcy, Mildred expresses her dissatisfaction by renting three roadside billboards upon which the following statements:\n\n    Raped While Dying\n    And Still No Arrests?\n    How Come, Chief Willoughby?\n\nThis expression of a grieving mother's distain was not received well by the townsfolk especially the sheriff and his deputy. The citizens of Ebbing had concerns over the efficacy of the sheriff resulting from the open secret of his medical condition, pancreatic cancer. It was not possible to muster much trust in his officer. It was commonly known that Dixon was an alcoholic and raging racist. Chief Willoughby is not unsympathetic of Mildred's desperation and anguish. Theirs's is a small-town police force ill equipped for such a heinous crime. He considers the billboards as an unwarranted personal attack on his character. Dixon reacts in a way that belies the myopic and vindictive mindset of a man motivated solely by his hatred and prejudice, unable to directly attack a inconsolable mother he lashes out by attacking those close to her. The negative pressure brought to bear upon Mildred and her depressed son, Robbie (Lucas Hedges). Despite the mounting disapproval, Mildred remains unwavering on course, refusing to remove her public indictment shaming the complete lack of progress forwarding justice. The owner of the billboards, Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones), is unduly pressured to remove the offending messages. Dixon's campaign of intimidation then focuses on her close friend and co-worker, Denise (Amanda Warren) on trivial marijuana possession charges. The harassment is unrelenting as Mildred's abusive ex-husband Charlie (John Hawkes), escalates her burden by blaming her for the torture and death of their daughter.\n\nThe way in which Martin McDonagh manipulates the circumstances intertwining it with a richly detailed character development is exceedingly rare. His resume is terse with only two feature length films prior to this movie. His 'Seven Psychopaths' was an enigmatic masterpiece whose almost recursive narrative engages the audience completely. He goes into this award season already possessing an Oscar for Best Short Film, proving he can condense a story to the essentials as well as exploring the nuances in exceptional detail. Following the story as it unfolds reminded me of walking around in New York City's Greenwich Village. The streets are set as if laid out at a tavern nearing closing time. They curve in occasionally crossing themselves is a delightfully wonderful maze. This film demands your complete attention. It is not for a casual afternoon viewing. Each frame contributes a crucial piece to the overall story, carefully crafted for maximum effect. This attention to details extends beyond the principle cast allowing the audience a realistic appreciation of the supporting characters. An example is an acquaintance of Mildred's, James, magnificently portrayed by Peter Dinklage. One of the most sought-after journeyman character actors, eljko Ivanek, plays the Desk Sergeant at the police station. Mr. McDonagh can attract a selection of the finest artist the industry has for his projects. The inclusion of these details proves critical elements to motivating the characters and advancing the narrative. The Chief's terminal diagnosis transitions into the resolution of the character allowing the organic infusion of his wife, Anne (Abbie Cornish), into this intriguing tapestry. It is nearly impossible to consider that Woody Harrelson became a familiar face to the public in a television sitcom, 'Cheers'. He has matured into one pf the most intensely powerful actors of his generation. This opus is the epitome of the independent film reaffirming the need for telling a story for the sake of the cinematic expression as an artform. For all film aficionados in dire need of a respite from the special effects dependent movies saturated with imagery and audio that challenges the senses, this is a work of drama that will touch the viewer on an intimately human level.",

            "content": "There is so much pent-up rage over the handling of rape, and police behavior in general, that I think Frances McDormand's character in this film really struck a chord with people.  She's on a crusade for her daughter who was raped and killed, and yet no progress has been made in the investigation.  She doesn't care who she offends, she won't be intimidated into silence, and she'll stand up for herself in some violent ways.  In an interesting twist, the police chief (Woody Harrelson) has pancreatic cancer, so aside from being called out on his investigation, he's dealing with that.  The scene McDormand and Harrelson have in an interrogation room, and a specific moment of that is easily the film's best.  Harrelson provides a voice of wisdom in the film, and the three letters he pens are also quite touching.  There is humor as well, in just how boneheaded one of the policemen (Sam Rockewell) is, and the gem of a moment when Peter Dinklage, otherwise largely wasted, utters the line \"Penelope said 'begets'?\", in a subtle burn of the 19-year-old now dating McDormand's ex-husband.\n\nThe film started strong, but along the way started losing me.  It suffers artistically from a lack of restraint, and everything seems exaggerated.  The profanity.  The characters, who start becoming cartoonish.  The level of violence.  The coincidences.  It seems to me that McDonagh's writing is a real issue here.  Her last words to her daughter were \"I hope you get raped,\" really?  To leave that in the script is egregiously bad, and an insult to the viewer's intelligence.  The Molotov cocktails, really?  The guy being in the station to begin with, and of course wearing ear buds, really?  A man thrown out of a window, and no arrest, really?  And on and on, until an ending which is pretty awful if you think about it.  It's just tough to appreciate the message of the film or its cast in light of all this.  It was entertaining to watch, but in my humble opinion, not worthy of all the acclaim.",

            "content": "Inspired by spotting some billboards about an unsolved crime, McDonagh, writer and director of films In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths writes and directs another sharp, quick-witted, bittersweet comedy that\u2019s probably more drama than funny. I\u2019m a great fan of his work and always look forward to his films but I never know quite what to expect. Our protagonist is Mildred, mother of a murder daughter who stubbornly challenges the local authorities for not concluding their investigation and failing to bring anyone to justice. Now she\u2019s incredibly obstinate, calculating and impossible to ignore, especially with her latest stunt of the three billboards that upset some of the locals and obviously the police department. She\u2019s abrasive, verbally aggressive to a vivid level, making her an absolute treasure to watch as she attacks, sometimes not just verbally, everyone that challenges her. She has that presence that demands attention and strikes fear into those who share it. The clash of attitudes and egos is abundant with Mildred going up against not only the police chief Willoughby (Harrelson) , but his bigoted, arrogant officer Dixon (Rockwell) her ex-husband and some of the town\u2019s people such as the dentist. But there\u2019s also that glimmer of a hurting and tragic human being, in fact; the audience is constantly bombarded with such strong performance of character you could (but you really can\u2019t) miss McDonagh\u2019s slips of humility that happen right at the perfect moments that keep this film well grounded. The story is totally captivating and engaging with surprising twists and heartfelt revelations that evoke powerful mixed emotions throughout. Harrelson and especially Rockwell are amazing in support and opposition. But every character here is perfectly portrayed and well balanced. It\u2019s a bittersweet drama that\u2019s often awkward, feeling uncomfortably happy especially when it\u2019s sometimes brilliantly inappropriate. It\u2019s full of remorse and eventual compassion, the journey the story takes and the character transition become incredibly touching and strangely uplifting towards the conclusion. McDonagh\u2019s regular composer, Carter Burwell, provides a brilliant western themed and often somber score that could be easily put to a modern western with cowboys and saloons. It\u2019s accompanied by a small mix of country, folk and pop music with tracks from Joan Baez, ABBA Townes Van Zandt and Monsters of Folk with a great scene for Dixon\u2019s love for soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming amazing voice. McDonagh\u2019s absolute masterpiece is storytelling in it\u2019s utter brilliance brought alive by McDormand and cast. But especially McDormand. [EDIT] It\u2019s an unsurprising and well deserved Oscar for McDormand who was originally reluctant to accept the role even though her part was originally written with her in mind. Equally well deserved Oscar for Rockwell too. Quite the accomplishment for a film to receive Oscars for both leading and supporting roles.

Frances McDormand deserves all the accolades she has received for this performance, and Woody Harrelson continues to amaze me in how much he has grown as an actor since his time as affable Woody Boyd. What has made me choose to take a few moments to share with people that may be considering watching this movie/story is the craftsmanship of the film itself.  There is a profoundly disturbing core to this movie.  A family is devastated and many times people treat each other in despicable ways however the film maker (Martin McDonagh)  finds subtle ways to show the underlying nature of both the main characters and supporting characters.  Each may seem a cliche of midwestern stereotypes at first glance but they also have moments that show who they are.  I could explain, but watch it and judge for yourself. By the way I am from Missouri - so no grief about the stereotypes comment. (I believe the film was actually filmed in West Virginia - so this is not a \"HOMER\" review.)",

            "content": "- It shouldn't take Three Billboards -\n\nThere is something to be said for a woman who doesn't need your approval but demands your respect. Frances McDormand (Fargo, Burn After Reading) does it best as grieving mother Mildred Hayes in Martin McDonagh's multiple prestigious award-winning project, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\n\nTrigger warning: It's a movie one shouldn't see unless they are prepared for several graphic descriptions of sexual violence or domestic abuse.\n\nI went to see this movie by myself, which was probably for the best. At the initial reveal of the third billboard's message, I began thinking in bullet-point notes. There are many ways we can fight the good fight, like by posting a status that says #MeToo or addressing the sheriff of a town on a billboard. In today's current climate of awareness around sexual misconduct, McDormand's portrayal as a mother and a victim of domestic abuse brings life and raw energy to the collective voices of women overcoming pain.\n\nThis powerful message is further fueled by the vision of Anglo-Irish director and screenwriter, Martin McDonagh. In an interview with The Guardian (which also addresses some concerns about race relations in Three Billboards), McDonagh was asked about the inspiration behind Mildred's brusque character. He said, \"As a kid, I used to idolise actors like Marlon Brando and James Dean. I used to try to model myself on those men. And little girls just don't have those kind of characters to emulate.\"\n\nUltimately, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri jolted me in the most painful yet confounding way. I was torn between empathy and disgust at the amount of crudely humorous lines that most of the white, male characters such as Sheriff Willoughby, played by Woody Harrelson (War for Planet of the Apes, Wilson), and Dixon, played by Sam Rockwell (F is for Family, The Dark Knight), were given.\n\nAs a woman looking forward to a future unsilenced, I was most affected by McDormand's memorable performance, which put a metaphorical megaphone to my ear and said the words I hope to one day hear from society: Your pain and experiences are valid, and you deserve to be listened to.\n\nThough this line wasn't actually delivered to me during Three Billboards, I did get to witness how a small fictional town reacts to the disgusting murder and rape of a young citizen, and their reactions are nothing short of revealing. While it may be difficult for some viewers to digest the movie's unfortunately commonplace subject matter, what made it worth it was the heaped reaction of a community to tragedy. While few were able to get through to Mildred, the entire town played a role in bringing the movie and fictional case to a close - albeit not one that I found satisfying or properly resolved. Still, I'm glad I bought myself a ticket to this jaw-dropping expos\u00e9 of emotion, abuse, and accountability.\n\nIt may have taken three billboards to wake up a fictional sheriff to the unresolved mystery of Mildred's daughter's death, but the following sentiment (and my favorite line) from Mildred to a newscaster felt like enough to wake up even the most passive audience: \"This doesn't f***ing put an end to anything, it's just the start. Why don't you put that on your Good Morning Missouri f***ing wake-up broadcast, b***h.\"\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri, and was written by Camilla Jeremie.

Because it's so bad and the critical reviews and critical acclaim for this movie are so good that I had to  throw in my two cents.  Where do I even begin with this?  \nI struggled to make it to the end of this movie because the script is so painfully awful.  The vast majority of acting in this movie is so bad and I can't tell if it's the actors or the horrible script.  Take the ex-Husband's girlfriend, for instance.  Take Dinklage's lines in the restaurant.  Take the lines of the office assistant at the advertising agency.  The list goes on.  People say the dumbest things in this movie.  \nIt's all so over wrought.  The script.  The acting.  the stars-aligning twists and turns.  The improbable behavior of ab-so-lutely everyone in this film.  it all has me asking how any critic anywhere can stomach this?  it's like a preachy lifetime movie with much better production quality.  \nThis movie is a movie that only a critic could rave about because critics are largely too afraid to knock anything with a positive message.  They all seem to believe that if a movie has a strong political message--like that racism is bad or homophobia is bad--they cannot say a bad thing about it because it's the same as dumping on the message.  that is nonsense.  However, it's the only reason I can see that someone can praise this cliched, improbable train-wreck of a film.  Having finished it, I am genuinely sorry that i didn't shut it off when dixon threw red out the window.  And, not to spoil things, but it ends with characteristic anti-climax and you know that the critics dig that tripe too.  I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how this got an academy nod for best picture.",

In reality, she would be likely be found guilty and spend most of the rest of her life in prison.

In real life, he is arrested, and charged with attempted murder, but alas, in this movie world there is no accounting of his actions.

The thing that really hooked me was the initial reveal of the full contents of the message on the billboards. It really conveys the utilitarian but desperate and deep sadness felt by the mother and lead played immaculately by Frances McDormand. Immediately following this I wanted to follow the story unravelling around these characters. \n\nThe plot plays out in a very organic way and isn't driven by setpiece narrative having the emotional and visual beats carried by excellent but restrained scenes of endearingly damaged characters who regularly step out of their mold which leads to a lot of surprising and occasionally brutal moments. What I mean by this is characters that in a lesser film would have leaned into their role of 'offensively ignorant but ineffectual comedic hate figure' or 'the hard boiled town stubborn Sheriff' and either got their comeuppance or played out the same until the end of the film, they have legit character arcs and do things that sometimes unsavoury out of sheer emotionally charged events.\n\nThe film is like a textbook presentation of the grief and suffering of family members and those around them whilst trying against the odds to get answers and carry on with life after one of the most horrendous conceivable events has happened. As grim as that sounds though somehow the film balances the gut wrenchingly sad moments with utter hilarity without it feeling forced. \n\nTo sum up I can't recommend this film enough. It might get you in the feels though depending on your constitution so be prepared!",

And, this movie will make you uncomfortable at times for things even beyond that unsolved crime. Even so, it's engaging, and interesting, and just when you think things will go one way, they go in a direction you hadn't imagined.\n\nMy only complaint about the  movie is the ending [SPOILER ALERT AHEAD]. While I know that plenty of crimes go unsolved year after year, when I see a movie, I don't like loose ends at the end. I didn't need a warm, fuzzy, tidy ending, but I needed some better level of resolution. I knew it probably wouldn't end in the clean way it felt like it would at one point, but I didn't expect to be left hanging either. It's even more disappointing to end that way after a film I've enjoyed so thoroughly up to that point.",

            "content": "I am, frankly, confused as to the mass praise this mediocre film has garnered. I was excited about this film after seeing the trailer several times, in spite of the fact that Martin McDonagh films have never been interesting to me. I stopped watching \"In Bruges\" mid-film. I went to see \"Seven Psychopaths\" in the theater and was bored.\n\nThe performances in \"Three Billboards\" saves this film from itself. Frances McDormand, while not breaking new ground in her character, she is a joy to watch, as always. Sam Rockwell is the most disturbingly enjoyable performance to watch as his behavior is so uncomfortable that one has to wonder how he got into such a mental state to be so unappealing. Woody, too, carries some of the most intense scenes in the film with a fantastic portrayal as Chief Bill Willoughby.\n\nWhere this film loses me is in its unnecessary and unsuccessful attempt to be \"quirky\" and toy with its audience. It's such an embarrassing attempt at \"artsy\" that it comes across a first-year screenwriter trying entirely too hard to be \"edgy.\" Yes, I get that irony of having \"Ebbing\" as the fictitious name of the city in Missouri in which this whole story takes place, as the entire perception and emotions of the main characters ebb and flow throughout the film, confusing the viewer into developing a belief or emotions about a character before zig-zagging into a completely altered perception of the character. This intentional mind-f*ck is elementary, poorly written and, frankly, hidden by how well the actors perform.\n\nThe bottom line of this film is that the viewer is supposed to see Frances McDormand one way, Sam Rockwell in the opposite way. Then, when the spindle of the film, the centerpiece, Woody Harrellson, dies, situationally, things change to alter how the viewer sees Frances' character and how the viewer sees Sam's character. There are many plot points used to create the details around why we see these two characters the way we do that, in this climax of Woody's death, are abandoned as \"irrelevant\" when we are made to see them a different way. Without going into a lot of details, the plot devices used are offensive, racially charged, homophobic, just disgusting on every level, which are items we've come to anticipate in movies from people like Quentin Tarantino, but they always seem to be relevant in the character and/or the plot. Here they are incredibly insensitive items, but then discarded as pointless for the sacrificial sake of forcing the viewer to change their opinion of these two characters. In the meantime, those plot devices are left there and leave so many unanswered questions, that one can't help but blame horrific writing for such careless use and resolution of those plot devices. It's astoundingly poor writing.\n\nIn the end, while the film intentionally doesn't end it the way most people would expect (which I'm fine with), and forcibly makes you realize that this film is about the change in its characters rather than wrapping up a typical storybook end, the flaws radiate more than ever.\n\nAs a result, I don't recommend anyone pay money to see this film. I also hope the white-dominant Academy and Hollywood Foreign Press see this film for what it is and not focus so much on the spoon-fed redemption, then judge it accordingly.",

Well, the police don't like it, most part of town does but there sure is raising some smoke from a nearly dead fire. We get to know some great figures. Woody Harrelson is the dying cop, Caleb Landry Jones is the sneaky billboard man, Sam Rockwell is the pretty worthless cop and Frances McDormand is the iron lady. Clarke Peters from \"The Wire\" is another great feature among smaller parts - the casting is magnificent.\n\nThere are a lot of humor hidden in this dark story. It's vivid still sad, believeable yet spectacular. The script is rock solid but for me Rockwell and Landry Jones are making such efforts that they both may get away with an Oscar. Cool, since they both have been off the radar for a while.\nI like the colors a whole lot and the pace got few problems. There are 20 minutes or so in the middle of it that makes it a bit draggy, though.

I personally found it entertaining throughout, and the performances from McDormand, Rockwell and Harrelson were brilliant. The storyline was also well put together but I was slightly disappointed with the ending. Although the subject matter was quite serious, the witty script made it a joy to watch, in a black comedy type of way, and it really does prove that you don't have to have a huge budget to make an entertaining movie. Anyway, the movie is about a mother, Mildred (Frances McDormand) who has become a recluse after her daughter is brutally murdered. After waiting 7 months for the police to come up with some results, she decides to take matters into her own hands by putting \"RAPED WHILE DYING\", \"STILL NO ARRESTS\" and \"HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?\" on three billboards, hence the title. The billboards upset a lot of people in her small town, including Chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), and officer Jason Dixon who is a racist and a violent alcoholic. As Bill was unable to solve the case, he is pushed to investigate the murder again, after the billboards cause a huge impact in the town. Whilst suffering with pancreatic cancer, Bill decides to take his own life after finding out that the cancer has progressed, which leaves Mildred with no answers about her daughter. After another violent event, Jason is sacked from the police but he decides to look into the murder after reading a note that Bill left him before he committed suicide. Out of frustration, Mildred decides to burn down the police station, not knowing that Jason is inside but he manages to escape with severe burns around his body. Whilst in a bar, Jason hears a man bragging to his friend about being with a girl around the time Mildred's daughter was killed, so he gets into a fight with him to try and get his DNA. After finding out that the DNA didn't match, Mildred is left with no leads but she is still determined to find out what happened to her daughter, even though everyone is telling her to drop it. Frances McDormand was perfect for her role, along with Sam Rockwell who was funny throughout. The cinematography was also perfect for the movie and the various cameos were great additions to this unique movie. It could have easily been a depressing, downbeat film because of it's emotional backdrop, which is why I was surprised with the outcome. Because of the amount of awards that this movie received, I hope that other directors follow suit, especially in this day and age of loads of sequels and remakes. A great watch!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was written and directed by Martin McDonagh, who also brought you In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths. Judging by his previous movies, Martin is definitely one for dark comedies but I doubt that he was expecting such a success with this movie. With Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell winning Academy awards for there roles in this film, which they thoroughly deserved, I can't wait to see what this director will come up with next. \n\nBudget: $12million\nWorldwide Gross: $158.6million\n\nGenre: Crime, Drama\nCast: Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Abbie Cornish, Caleb Landry Jones, Kerry Condon, Alejandro Barrios, Zeljko Ivanek, Peter Dinklage, Amanda Warren, Sandy Martin, John Hawkes, Clarke Peters and Samara Weaving. 8/10",

The \"bad\" guy, the sheriff, is the most sympathetic of the main characters. If this were supposed to be a clever flip, it wasn't communicated in the film. The film is well-paced and worth a watch. It's just that it's something you watch as an observer of how crappy people are to one another, and not because you care about what happens.

It won five awards, including Best Film and Outstanding British Film (making it the only film along with The King's Speech to win both awards since the latter category was reintroduced in 1992) while both McDormand and Rockwell won the Lead Actress and Supporting Actor awards respectively. \nIt was nominated for four awards at the 24th Screen Actors Guild Awards, winning three, including Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. \nAt the 90th Academy Awards it received seven nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actress for Frances McDormand, Best Original Screenplay for Martin McDonagh and two Best Supporting Actor nominations for both Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson. McDormand and Rockwell took home their respective awards.\nIt was named one of the top 10 films of the year by the American Film Institute. At the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, the film won its top prize, the People's Choice Award. At the 2017 San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, it won the Audience Award.\nThis movie is a RENT. I'm not 100% sure if it is worth buying as it may not be worth multiple viewings.

            "content": "A canonical class on character development, performances and direction\n\nA game-changer. I have just witnessed one of the- narratively speaking -more intense feature films ever, one that, surprisingly, doesn't require Parisian landscapes or delicate photographs to be the most effortlessly acidic film offer in a very long time, one incorporating a really powerful drama and a delicious caustic black humor, putting you as a voyeur of the pain of others, a depraved buy purgative activity.\n\nWithout a doubt, the greatest strengths of this towering work are in its script. The plot places us directly at the heart of the matter: three polygonal and outdated billboards that serve as a purifying instrument for characters and audience alike. A succinctly-shaped storyline of this kind must be reputed as a narrative milestone, for as a result of a tragic event, a mother drowned by grief and her voracious desire for justice will be the perfect machinery for executing finely-chained maneuvers, prioritizing a down-to-earth plot that will keep interest at its highest level. I'm still seriously disturbed by this fascinating, groundbreaking and invigorating screenplay; it's some time now since an American-British screenplay with a level of humanity and moral complexity as outstanding and superb as Martin McDonagh's latest opus is, who in addition to directing, is credited as the absolute artifice of this emotional purge. Thanks to this man, the world has been able to enjoy situations surpassing the epic drama, crowning moments, allowing each actor to show off their major talents, without falling into shameful exaggerations. While an interesting and ambiguous morality traverses each of the corners of the story, factors such as loss, guilt and grief compose this human-immersion treatment, setting up captivating parallels that become this film a real re-visitable and laudable-to-death experience. What makes the script feel so close and real are its characters, a plausible human mimesis, and by imitation I refer to the most basic instinct of tragedy, which is to portray the feats of  a hero in a lofty way, his complications, his detriments, his victories; here the variable is that the purposes of tragedy and comedy are interspersed. The film talks about substantial issues from known perspectives but presented in unusual ways: injustice, police corruption, mourning, past and future, the consequences of actions, the weight of consciousness, the power of media, ignorance, egocentricity and forgiveness are condensed into an incisive one-hour-fifty-five-minute critique that, even when it reveals countless messages and sad realities, is masterfully enhanced and justified by the coherent and functional assemblies that allow to find truth through fiction ironically, one that seems to be malformed and satirized, without realizing that this \"irregular and hysterical satire\" is our planet, it's called humanity, and you and I, my dear friend, have an important mission in all this trouble. For the person who has already watched the flick, will be clear that the three big stars pop up on screen with an almost-measured time, winning over audiences with just a few minutes. Out of respect and honor, we must begin with the matron and already glorified Mildred. Lately, some harsh reproaches shake cinema elites due to the lack of high-powered female roles, however, now we're witnessing a hopeful reawakening for all the females, not only in the form of crew members, but also empowered characters that enlighten and frighten, fictional women conceived, in this particular case, by a man paradoxically. The leading role of \" Fargo\" wonderful actress Frances McDormand, which will surely lead her name to global media focus, she expels strength, even when her heart is broken into hundreds of pieces. This impetuosity is precisely the agent allowing an almost instantaneous connection from the first scene on the road, that imperfection, remorse and feeling, seeking vindication in such emotional ways that announces the establishment of a new Ellen Ripley, for indie-drama genre, her brave nature, supported on the grief of a mother, stirs up a sensational feeling from which the film drinks on several times to achieve an unbeatable narrative cadence. This lady is on fire when she appears on the screen, her lines are as sincere as cutting, her motivations are tangible and they move away from an implanted affliction as much as they can. Mildred could be the film female character of the year, surpassing an incredible number of warriors such as Diana Prince from \"Wonder Woman\", Lady Bird McPherson from \"Lady Bird\", Elisa from \"The Shape of Water\", Kay Graham from \"the Post\" or Tonya Harding from \"I, Tonya.\" And although all these women use peculiar tools that allow their characters to become symbols of equality and hope, but Mildred's keys are the pain of the death, the blow of loneliness, the defects of pride, the constancy of convictions and the withering faith, which are reflections of difficult reality. \"Those billboards aren't gonna bring her back, Mildred\" -  says Charlie angrily -but those three geometric revealing billboards will satisfy her desires by serving as a balm for her open wounds. The second great discovery is underestimated-actor Sam Rockwell. The last and first time I remember this surprisingly-sedulous actor on screen was three years ago, starring a disappointing and moderately-acceptable kind-of-remake of Tobe Hooper's enigmatic and disturbing masterpiece, \"Poltergeist\", an attempt to renovate it directed by Gil Kenan which flopped because of its poorly congruent relations trying to touch new audiences as the 1982 classic did. Rockwell played a one-dimensional family grappling with supernatural phenomena which are depicted through creepy branches, smart televisions or sinister clowns, relegating his role to a protective father who wants to bring his daughter back. However, sometime later I had the pleasure of witnessing that his fellowship with the director dated back several years, exactly with \"Seven Psychopaths\", a crime comedy that anticipated a true blue-eyed filmmaker's interesting voice, with all the requirements this holds. Now, Rockwell returns with a worthy-recognition role, a really big one, Dixon, an alcoholic sheriff who doesn't frequent good manners, an arrogant policeman who doesn't care to pass over the world to be victorious. Needless to say, this actor executes one of the most powerful moments of the film at the hands of his character. The sequence in which he attacks an innocent, naive and crafty Red, interpreted by \"Get Out\" terrifying actor Caleb Landry Jones, must be framed up; The edition, the setting, the cinematography and the sequence itself radiate pure cinema, his sudden actions scare you while involuntarily perk up our innermost violence senses, we feel an inexplicable pleasure with his immoral behaviors, because in advance we know that his actions will provoke him a much more painful purge, but more exciting for us. A timeless shout-out for this troublesome and abrasive character who returns to put Rockwell on the front page. Last, but not least, is a not-remotely-unusual player, as most of his performances get to touch the overwhelming, the really overwhelming. Hoarding more than 93 credits as an actor and a wide range of nominations from different festivals and ceremonies, Mr. Woody Harrelson, about to debut in \"Star Wars\" canon and DC Comics flicks, hits the mark his latest role. Willoughby is a police chief who failed to fully resolve a murder and rape crime, moreover, he's outweighed by repercussions that cause the three billboards of the protagonist and a life-or-death decision, here a controversial debate rises up, to confront a dreaded fatal fate. There is also a palpable charm between this man and the director/writer, who had also collaborated in \"Seven Psychopaths\", because although the character pops up on screen relatively a short time, achieves the unimaginable in a pic of this genre: he affects through fear. His determinations, narratively, stir up the emergence of other valuable important ones, however, the final twist leaves us desiring much more about his character, a nonchalant, dominant but respectful dude, a human who would represent, in a good way, the middle class. Conservative, loving and a little too sexual, these human facets, like those of the previous two characters, are the ones that make the film feel so close, so phenomenally real. There is no doubt that this gentleman is one of the best post-modern actors, so let us pray that, henceforth, he may sign up for adventures as endearing as Willoughby's.\n\nA huge praise deserves some set-pieces pushing beyond the mettlesome narrative development. The film is rich in sequences that transmit by means of the pictures, and although it's almost impossible to avoid spoilers, it can be said that such strong points are distributed proportionately between the scenes where supporting and leading characters are involved- of course, all the terribly enjoyable performances -in other words, between sequences that don't focus only on the bad-ass protagonist, even though, indirectly, all the moves lies on her. A mother, two local sheriffs, flames, explosions, love affairs, three billboards on deep-scarlet background and serious lettering, a surly dentist and a hired murderer are the ingredients used for the construction of a film which is based on its potent and articulated screenplay, it's unimaginable what can be capture from this breakdown, even if it doesn't require multiple readings or esoteric meanings, because what the screenwriter-director wants to take for us is there, on the surface, the problem is that there are so many things to catch that seems unattainable to process and enjoy with one single bite.\n\nIt's worth emphasizing on the analytical and emotional display and the mechanisms employed to reach the purifying conclusion of the story. Elements as simple as that three subsequent billboards motivate a staggered succession of narrative steps, with the general function of preparing the way for the development of characters, because it's precisely these which gear Anglo-Irish playwright's movie, they are, most of all, those who make this indie low-budget experiment a master class of character construction, which thus become it a significant achievement for modern-day cinema. Besides, in the end, It doesn't provide an explicit solution to the leitmovit itself, however, the most demanding audiences aren't in search of fairy tales, because the film isn't a crime thriller in which you must find the guilty and take revenge ala Liam Neeson, no, this is a fantastic real-life drama, a work that shows how human relationships can be integrated or broken down each other, it must be understood that it is not a severe rule to apply pyrotechnics into the narrative to breathe power, here, it's simply the reaches of man are the core motivation, digs into the deepest (painful) parts of us to demonstrate what, even being \"fiction\", we can do moved by anger, pride or sadness; McDonagh's feature film is a sincere and satisfactory portrait of the motivations and repercussions of human action, which is attributed to characters of such three-dimensional characteristics that could well exist in our reality. It's amazing that someone reminds you how cinema can break the barrier between reality and fiction.\n\nThe score is brutal. From the start, I have considered musical accompaniments as key pieces for the success of transmission of emotions, of truth; A filmmaker must get to most possible resources to make sense of the specific and general purposes of the story, so I personally think that a simple melodic structure supports fabulous acting and creative task. Carter Burwell, who curiously had also worked with Mr. McDonagh in \"Seven Psychopaths\", has behind him gold scores of the stature of \"Carol\", \"Anomalisa\" and \"Mr. Holmes\"; Now, he reappears with full hands through compositions that are rightly coupled with the most heartfelt moments of the film, His score for this story express, on many occasions, more than pictures, because from masterful and harmonic sounds he transmits grief, tribulation, intractability and madness accompanying the characters, while potentiates his chances to opt for the coveted golden man. We will have to keep a close eye on this New Yorker, as he insinuates being the next monster producing excellent soundtracks for deep films thanks to his undeniable talent.\n\nIn particular, there is an audiovisual effectiveness and impact meter inside every person. Personally, that phenomenon is in the depths of my chest and arises when I sense the final minutes of an inspiring adventure, it's like a chip that only turns on if I feel that the journey, regardless of its context and text, has really paid off, there is a mix between happiness and sadness, emotion and anxiety that emerge from a really good film, however, only a privileged few - surprisingly, 2017 has been an excellent year for cinema with social purpose -control such a position. So I have the pleasure and humility, coming from a lover of cinema, to announce that the humor and dark drama of this film touched my heart and mind in priceless ways. \"Three billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" written and directed by Martin McDonagh will make history in my review Watchlist as the first motion picture in which I didn't evaluate technical or visually artistic aspects, which clearly are executed in a beautiful, crude and stunning way, however, I haven't considered them as a fundamental part because this film is purely story and characters. I was skeptical about a true audiovisual production mustn't be made up of visual, narrative and creative art, however, this work has shown me that art can be conceived by putting some components a greater importance than others, but finally, they are all there. A blistering catharsis led by top-notch performances and a glorified direction, this film is the most human, poignant, shocking and coherent drama I have seen in a long time, a major achievement for cinematographic narrative that reveals the potential emergence of a feasible writing maestro, while it serves as a magnet to unite a hugely talented group of people who make the film what it is.",

It depicts a strong-willed grieving mother who will do anything to find her child's dead body. Three Billboards also stresses a cliche theme in pop culture regarding police racism, and police distrust.

It is written by an Engishman who probably never met anyone from the rural midwest and who demonstrates his biggoted perception of rural midwesterners through his script.",

It has a rather bizarre take on human behavior, trying ultimately to convince us that love and forgiveness are the most important human emotions, but along the way showing us mostly brutal and stupid human beings engaged in the most outrageous behavior with the most inexplicable lack of consequences much of the time.  There are numerous issues of logical inconsistency or contrived situations that play out in ways that make little sense, not just that they are unexpected but that they are loony and abhorrent.  Frances McDormand is an excellent actress, but here she plays a character who is unconvincing as a bereaved mother who, in her grief over the loss of her daughter, is not just righteously angry but downright mean and undeserving of our sympathy the more we learn about the investigation into that murder.  Woody Harrelson plays a sheriff who is the target of McDormand's character as she faults him for failing to find her daughter's killer, but the film wants us to see the sheriff as a very decent guy who is the loving core of the film. Yet he can't even discipline his racist, lazy officer who runs amok much of the time.  Sam Rockwell was given awards for his portrayal of that rogue cop, played in a way that is more freakish and hateful than sympathetic.  I don't consider this a bravura performance at all; it's more of an oddball play for dark humor that just doesn't work well.  The final scenes are more unbelievable than redeeming in a film that can't manage to make enough sense.",

Just the same old stereotype of \"southern\" cops being bad cops.\n\nThere were just so many things that I wasn't buying, i.e. wasn't believable. The constant harassment of Sam Rockwell of Caleb Landry Jones, like in the middle of the street, or in the bar. Just didn't buy it would ever happen.\n\nLike the priest scene. Never would happen. Only in fantasy writing land.\n\nLike the dentist was gonna use torturous methods against Frances. None of this would EVER happen. Just made no sense and poorly written.\n\nThis movie was one not believable scene after the other. For example, the Police chief coughing up blood and spitting it in Frances face. Never would have happened.\n\nWriters: STOP WRITING DIALOGUE AND SCENARIOS that never would happen.\n\nThe one scene that actually felt real, was the daughter scene needing the car and they started arguing about it. But to go to another scene that would NEVER happen. Ex-husband throws over the table and tries to strangle Frances, then the son take knife to ex, and then the new girl (way too young) makes a \"comedic\" entrance and reacts totally in a way no one would ever react.\n\nUnfortunately, it was soooo painful to watch, but I guess with so many worse movies out, the below mediocre films get a lot of praise.",

She is 60 and could easily play 70 but not 50.\nThere is only one marginally believable and likable character in the movie and he kills himself.  By this time, I was thinking of joining him.  The cast of police officers contained not one memorable character.  The much touted bad guy cop who is somehow reformed by a letter from the dead sheriff and getting badly burned just never becomes real to me.\nThe Mother does insane things ending with firebombing the police station.

All the main actors, and even some of the minor ones, really gave it their all. Solid, beautiful performances all around. We need more characters like these. Characters that feel human, that are whole and complex beings.\n\nThe story pulled me in from the get-go. It didn't waste any time, every moment in this movie felt right and in its place, a part of a larger complete whole. The tonal shifts felt amazing and human. The comedy was done just right, the drama was done just right, the mix in between was great and felt natural. I'm actually really satisfied by how well all these tones meshes together here. Shows they did a good job. The story also shifts and progresses in such an engaging way, but steers clear of an ending that's tied up too well. It's so confident in what it aims to achieve. You could see that it's a project that was done after the people involved were completely satisfied with what they had. It looks like a great passion project.\n\nThe cinematography was unexpectedly gorgeous, yet subtle. The songs complimented the movie well. The visuals were all very crisp and alive. The editing helped tie this movie together as well as it ended up. No complaints here. Loved it.\n\nSam Rockwell better win that damn supporting actor Oscar.",

But the film just isnt up to the task of  dealing with its grim subject matter.  I could be wrong but one would think the rape and murder would leave a small town like Ebbing shattered for years after.  And likewise the police department would not be brushing aside the event as unsolvable but instead doing all they could to not leave a black mark on their record.  But for some reason in this movie the Sherrif and his staff seem only mildly annoyed about the crime that happened less than a year before.  And the townspeople strangely turn on the mother of the victim when she has the billboards put up.  So right off the bat i thought the film was very hard to believe . Likewise when it tries to suddenly turn into a quirky colorful comedy it left me wondering...wait wasnt this a film about a rape and murder?  No doubt its a difficult task to get a story rolling after such a  horrific crime its starts with but that still doesnt excuse the film.  It still needs to tell a reasonably believe able story.  And then we get that the sherriff has terminal cancer.  I mean I normally dont get into understated films but this one goes in the other direction.  Its like it was made by Marvel comics.    The story goes on from there with more broad stroke comical turns in the story (bad cop turns into good cop etc.)   At least one scene -where one cop reads a poignant letter unaware that flames are building around him-is apparently unintentionally funny.  And Frances McDormand doesnt add much depth to her role.  She just glares coldly and angrily.    I dont know.  Maybe this film was supposed to work as a metaphor?  Maybe i am just missing something.     But I was really expecting something here like No Country for Old Men.  Something gritty with character and layers of meaning.  Didnt get any of that here,.",

I thought that the movie was going to make a statement about Willoughby and how he was beloved in the small town because overall he was a nice man and a good person but yet he was also compellable in the crimes associated with his gang (a.ka. the police). At some point Willoughby said something to the effect of \"oh if I didn't hire racists I wouldn't have any officers\" which reads as a lazy generalization on the part of his character to not do better due diligence on the hiring in his force. So, sure he's a nice guy... but he's compellable so he's actually not the hero the town is making him out to be.  \n\nFurthermore I though the movie was going to demonstrate the social backlash of speaking up when you witness racism or calling the police out when they're not doing their jobs properly. Mildred's son demonstrated how he would prefer to remain socially compliant over outspoken because of the social pressure to conform around him whereas Mildred felt increasing pressure to fall into the social norms and behaviors of her small town. \n\nI was really impressed with the movie up until none of this above actually happened. What did end up happening was that the racist cop got some strange, confusing redemption arc and became the main focal point of the movie that we were expected to sympathize with. \n\nWhat a complete disappointment",

            "content": "Frances has a thing for dark comedies. Watch out, Joel!\nTHREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI\nI love that Oscar season bring us some true, well-crafted gems that mix a considerable amount of dare with a fresh voice that is fully aware of his influences. I do think Oscars do tend to rely on simpler movies that are way more straight-forward and oscar-baity, but every year there are some captivating and out of the blue picks. Three Billboards stands out as a fully realized film with one of the strongest screenplays of the year which connects with a watchful director that works with his actors to develop characters in a way that feels overarching to us. And although Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson's performances are levelled representing what a supporting actor should be all about, Frances McDormand's takes the cake. Her character is one of the most gratifying and enrapturing female character of recent memory, with a woman whose emotions are played out through subtle movements, body posture and a foul mouth that makes her entirely genuine. It's enthralling to watch as Mildred deals internally with her anger and how she decides to make her actions the continuation of the fire we see in her eyes. That goes along perfectly with the movie's greatest theme: the duality of anger. We start to be fondly aware of anger, it's our way of laughing and connecting to her. Then, the movie realizes that anger is not the answer but acknowledges its importance in the process of grief. And it's in this town that is a character by itself where Mildred furthers her anger and interacts with the police force who seems ineffective. The film faultlessly develops anger throughout it and balances with a dark sense of humour, finding wit in grim situations and the playfulness of our condition as humans that don't really understand how to deal with each other. It understands that anger is inherently connected with laughter, as they fought for attention like Inside Out. Ultimately, it's the reminder that the solution in our pain isn't in the world around us and that, nonetheless, we have to make it suffer before we're at peace with ourselves",

A unique portrayal of a vindicative, strong and completely broken mother who chooses to grasp the sharp edges and form the answer to the unsolved rape and murder case through blood and tears directed by Martin McDonagh. \n\nNevertheless, the contradictory fight for revenge, or else justice, bounces back upon her shoulders as a rope of distraught reputation of her son, public scandals and agonizing loathings in town. The portrayal of the mother by Frances McDormand is indeed phenomenal. As its reflected in her sincere glance, an unspoken code of motherhood is revealed in her caring yet hidden. The fragility and loss of a lonely individual slips out rarely, nevertheless leaving a clear mark of pathos and empathy in the audience. \n\nThe bleak, sand, grey shades of the image only reinforce the idea of fading people in a fading, decaying town. \u00abThree Billboards\u00bb de-romanticizes the idea of a maudlin tragedy which has become increasingly popular nowadays in cinematography, capturing the vivid good versus evil cases of sacrifice, suicide and sorrow. The mature approach that reveals the darkest, sharpest edges and the complexity of conflict over human emotions, relationships and actions. \n\nThe film may reveal footsteps of long-gone humanity and faith in it to one part of the audience, whereas the other will only recognize a disappointing feature of egoism, cruelty and giving up. The sincerity and flawed nature of the characters makes the story reflect reality, a believable, painful and anarchic case of the consequences, not the crime. \u00abThree Billboards\u00bb leaves you in an inexorable search for human values, morality and humanity.",

            "content": "The whole thing misfires completely - racist, crude, insipid, 100% UNREALISTIC  \n\nI don't know where to begin with this criticism. After all the hype it was very disappointing. \n\nThe entire cast - with the surprising exception of Weed aficionado Woody Harleson - are miscast, Frances McDormand included. It is like they were staging the production with an under attended drama group, so they had to shoehorn various unsuitable people into the roles. \n\nThe film is uniquely broad in its racism. Of course the first type is blatant against the nasty white man, this will be why it did so well at the BAFTAs etc, with the film embodying a gloriously unsubtle yet well established paradigm that all white male cops in the South are just racists or restrained-racists. Secondly, we have the insipid racism - clearly lost on the good people at BAFTA - towards the back people. This is demonstrated by McDonagh's failure to allow them any major roles or much screen time bar the short appearance of the new black chief of police. The black peoples live as adjuncts to the benevolent good white people. It is really like a film set in pre-Revolutionary times where their only hope is for a white person to be nice or take an interest. It was infuriating. Oh and throw into the mix a small person or 'midget' in the form of Peter Dinklage so what does McDonagh do... include him as a normal person? Or make a spectacle out of him... you guess. \n\nThis culminates in McDormand and Rockewell throwing about the N-word randomly. This is a dicey thing for any actor to do, and here, it just feels forced; as though McDonagh has jammed it in to generate some shock laughs. Well congratulations Martin, you wrote down a naughty word. For a film that takes itself so seriously on racism and has tried to stand as a virtuous tome for the oppressed the nonchalant approach to it feels fake as hell. \n\nThe main issue with the film is the entire premise: A young blonde woman/girl (she is 18 at the time of the crime) is gang raped, murdered then severely burned or murdered by the incineration itself, and seven months later, the mother applies greater pressure to the Police Department of the local town to spend more time finding the unapprehended perpetrators, while the townsfolk take against the mother for trying to get the cops to do their job... Let me ask you, you live in a sleepy small town in MO where a girl has been gang raped, murdered and her body largely destroyed by a fire. Would you A) want the police to get their act together and  do everything within their power to find the rapists/killers EVEN IF THIS TAKES DECADES, (WHILE YOUR TOWN SLOWLY RECOVERS FROM THIS DEVASTATING OCCURRENCE!) or B) express universal displeasure at the mother and her pleas for greater attention to be given to the crime, and side with the ineffectual police force, and just forget about the un-apprehended rapists/killers... to the point that you assault the mother and vandalise property!\n\nMoreover McDormand's surrounding family seem to have been afflicted by the same blas\u00e9 attitude to this egregious crime on their sister/daughter. The estranged husband is much more interested in his new and unbelievably young girlfriend while the son is unhappy about it all, because 'some guys on the team' have been giving him hassle  about the fuss McDormand is now making. This is so bizarre!!! \n\nWoody Harleson is good as the chief of local police, he brings a warmth to the role. But his B story involving him having cancer and killing himself by a gunshot wound to the head is bizarre. The guy is healthy enough to romp about with his (again) strangely young and bizarrely accented New Zealander wife, but then after leaving her on the sofa in their living room he nips of to write seemingly enumerate Last Letters, then pop up to his barn and kill himself... oh with just enough time to let his horses out of their stable. No good reason, perhaps some metaphor about freedom but again it just seems weird. Him having cancer and dying is a strange counterpoint to the narrative of the young girl's rape and murder, one I do not get the point of. Aside it's place in the story, McDonagh cannot know much about cancer and how it affects people. \n\nOur Best Supporting Actor winner is fine in the role but there is little depth to it and again he seems miscast, i.e. far too old to be playing a young cop. He beats up black people, he uses pejoratives, he's seemingly corrupt but also of course stupid and only able to live with his old Red-Necky mother. Cheer's Martin, lets all set about and have some good ole Red Neck bashing in this really sophisticated and nuanced way! People have a problem with his conversion to good cop, (the incident is again bizarre as he is seemingly oblivious to the roaring fire, started by multiple petrol bombs, that grows and surrounds him) which is actually one of the more believable parts of this movie for me. He gets a letter from his dead friend finally praising him as well giving him some stern advice, if anything would make a person change, a correspondence like that would.  But his whole story-arch is just so one dimensional, its like 'The Hero's Journey' for complete beginners, not Academy Award Nominees/Winners! It is so contrived and false I just cannot entertain it.  Continuing the unbelievable theme; Rockwell seriously injures a guy for no legal reason, he almost kills the man in broad daylight in the middle of the town, but that goes unchallenged! and he is only reprimanded for being disrespectful to the new police chief! Again, as with the subject of cancer, it is like McDonagh has no concept of violence or its ramifications other than what he knows from the television. \n\nI have a general problem with the deifying of Mildred. This woman is kind of a loser, she is a rude and generally unimpressive person who kind of just slobs around, getting gauded into random acts of violence... This is the woman Selman Hayek lauds as a paragon of female virtue. \n\nEven odder than all this is the handsome stranger who appears midway through the film. It seems like this guy who threatens McDormand in a mind bogglingly blatant way is crucial to the whole story! But why does this happen, why threaten her and make himself known? He must be very important right, and he is the same guy that Rockwell takes the DNA from AND he bragged about raping a woman... But according to the DNA it is not him who raped Angela... So sorry what was the point of him at all? To give something for McDormand and Rockwell to bond over? Why did he threaten her, why if he is from Idaho is he in Missouri?! Was he there to give McDormand a chance to enact some vigilante justice? Well we never get the chance to find out as the film just stops.  \n\nWhile not a terrible film, it keeps a good pace largely, with some touching and emotional moments; there are just so many problems with the production that I for one cannot over look; even if the masses seem to have been seduced by the rampant white dude bashing. \n\nWhat has film come to?",

As if to drive home the point that these cops are RACIST, they must use the n word, more than once.

            "content": "(4 out of 4) Three Billboards was one of 2017's most critically acclaimed films and I can agree with the praise it has received. The film centers around an angry mother dealing with the loss of her daughter who was murdered months ago. She is frustrated with the police's inadequacy with how they are handling the situation, so she decides to take matters in her own hands by renting out three billboards that send a message to the chief of police to do their job. It causes an uproar in the city. The billboards act is at the start of the film and movie focuses on a series of events that unfold that occur after the act. The first praise goes towards it having one of the finest casts of 2017. It stars Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, as well as other recognizable faces. No characters feels out of place and they all act accordingly with the films tone. I will say that the character with the most moving performance is from Rockwell as a corrupt cop who undergoes a character arc that is at times devastating. It's always a challenge for a filmmaker to get you to feel for an unpleasant person, but the movie pulls it off by letting you spend extra time with the character and allowing you to witness his redemption. When it comes to what the movie is about (not the plot, but the themes), there has been debating about it. From my perspective, the movie seems to be about redemption, justice, and having the guts to take action. At the beginning, It seemed like it may go a police brutality route because of some things said by characters at the beginning, and adding on the fact that it is a topic discussed profusely in our culture. There may be something in there about the idea, but to be honest, I don't think it's about that. If there's anything else, I may have to look harder. Despite my confusion, I can say that the drama is always riveting and I was always curious to see how the movie unfolded. I love when a film transcends traditional narrative structure and avoiding falling under one genre. It's mostly dramatic, but offers dark comedy as well. It's among my Top 5 of the year.",

It's funny in that effortless way that Tarantino used to be able to do and makes the characters all feel instantly more real and rounded as a result.  The central trio of  McDormand, Rockwell and in particular Harrelson are really brilliant and I was completely enthralled throughout.

I can see why he won.",

I would be afraid to go to this small town, where girls get raped and burned, deputies are racists, sherriff's stiff arm everyone, and people throw molotov cocktails at the police station.  What a violent place.  For the most part this was a weird movie, that didn't really develop any sympathy from me, and left me feeling confused as to the point.",

When we talk about the script, something that awakens our attention, we expect the script to be adapted, but we are surprised to know that it is an original script, which makes the film even more interesting, since it opens many margins for the good director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh, telling the story of a mother indignant at the death of her daughter unresolved by the police, the film creates a context, and within it inserts its characters, some very caricature, but all very deep, or at least with some development, in addition, the long builds characters to then break, weaken and raise them again. The film talks about racism, violence, abuse of authority, homicide and domestic violence, of course, a pure feeling of impotence to be fought, the film is a machine gun for criticism, even though they are all exaggerated in absurd contexts. it is no longer a critical movie. Technically, the film is very good, with a greater emphasis on its great editing, composition of scenes, and great angles, open, with planes sequences, traveling, the camera of the film behaves perfectly, in addition to a photograph that warm, remembering a good old western. Frances McDormand is completely amazing, frightening and crazy, the character scares, and makes the viewer buy his idea, besides showing his sweet and ferocious moments, the other highlight goes to Sam Rockwell, who for me is the best character of the film, a character broken by nature, a class on how to build an antagonist, without vanity or modesty, Woody Harrelson too, is charming and captivating, even having little screen time. Finally, \"Three ads for a crime\" is not perfect, far from it, has problems, has scenes explained that do not need to be explained, has moments that is disconnected with the context that created, but still, it is a very good movie .",

            "content": "One thing is for sure. If you ever decide to go into the advertising billboard business don't plan on using  Ebbing, Missouri as your launch pad. They make would-be advertisers use giant sized billboards on a back road where no one will see them and where eventually they will obviously fall into disrepair. This is where Mildred, (Frances McDormand) comes in. A curmudgeonly and waspish woman, who is seeking action from the local police in finding her missing daughter's abductor and, we must assume, her eventual killer. Mildred decides to rent the billboards to grab police attention and advertise in oversized black text the lack of police commitment.\n\nThe numerous preposterous situations in this film can be attributed to a lethal combination of a writer who feels ill at ease with story telling and fatally treats his words as holy writ. He should have had a strong director with him to flag up the flimsy logic and horrid clich\u00e9s. A director who wouldn't let him get away with it.  Unfortunately, when the two of them got together, their admiration for each other's work was so intense and resilient,  they just couldn't bring themselves to openly question the other's thought process. But they must have both had their suspicions about each other because the flaws want to sort themselves out as the film goes along. Tanker loads of midnight oil must have been burnt beavering away on adding bits to get the plot to catch up and explain itself.\nSadly, this film lacks that thread of logic that must exist for an audience to truly believe in the plot. Logic should be the cornerstone. Give an audience a logical story and they will follow. Toy Story, Superman, etc. all fantasy, but all fiercely logical.\nIn any event, both the writer and the director finally gave up on logic and relied instead on three huge, sleight of hand performances to cover any inconvenient truths.\n\nThis film is a mass of contradictions. It has no sense of location. For a start there are few stores in this town.  There are no grocery stores or McDonalds or anything - or if there are we don't get to see them. We just don't know where we are - or even in what time zone.  But hang on, I'm forgetting that's not necessary because it's in the title. It's Ebbing, Missouri. And it's about Three Billboards. And they're outside town. \n\nNow, just like the lack of stores in Ebbing, the townsfolk are sparse and a weird bunch too. There aren't that many of them but all have presumably been extras in Westerns for most of their lives and as a result stand around on Main Street watching meekly as one of Ebbing's finest, a twerpy, semi-literate cop (Sam Rockwell) inflicts violence on the aforementioned, mild mannered citizens. \nBut no one notices. No one complains. It's as though a part of this town has been set aside to allow a manic theatre troupe to indulge in a sub-culture of idiocy of truly Truman Show proportions.\nThere's the obligatory drunk police chief - no wait a minute, that's Sam Rockwell, he's the drunk but he's not the chief. The police chief is Woody Harrelson and he has a terminal illness but other than that, only the scantest of other clues to his character.\nWe know he is married to a young Australian girl (Abbie Cornish). Who says Hollywood can no longer contemplate a ludicrous age gap? But the Cornish character was presumably on a doomed domestic flight from Sydney to somewhere when she found herself stranded in the twilight zone that is Ebbing.  \n\nHarrelson and Cornish have two children who are cute and play a curious fishing game by themselves on the edge of a lake. This allows their parents  to treat themselves to some off screen hanky-panky and because of this their childrens' safety is rather secondary.  Harrelson's quiet performance, in a wonderful white shirt, has echoes of Jeff Bridges in 'Hell or High Water'. Although that's where the comparison ends. He really exists only in the mind of the director or writer,  or both of them, to compose three hand written letters that will get our director or the writer off a troublesome hook and make everything right for everybody. \nThen, finally there's Frances McDormand as Mildred , our Three Bill Boards girl. Now, anyone who has seen Ms. McDormand in previous productions will have fond memories of Fargo and Blood Simple and Olive Kitteredge and so on. But, and let's be clear about this,  Frances McDormand could waltz through this sort of script while asleep. On a stretcher. In the dark.  A ground breaking performance it is not.  It's as though she planned to try something else but, and Pavlov was right on this, as soon as an actor sees a red light and hears a bell many of them just can't help but deliver their stock performance. \nIn McDormand's case it's from her Sour and Harsh canon and regrettably she will not develop beyond this now as an actress.  \n\nSo what does all this strange little film add up to? Probably, just like La La Land, it proves you can fool all of the people some of the time - even an Oscar jury.\nMy memory of Three Billboards will be the indulgent script and lack of editing and Sam Rockwell's strange haircut and Frances McDormand's relentless bandana and strange haircut and Clarke Peters flashing his cop's badge a little too early -  so when an elderly 'Sidney Poitier' shows up in town our surprise \nis muted. \nOddly, and this is a clue to how a film can mask the insubstantial talent of the writer and director, the minor roles here only serve to amplify the massive theatricality of the principal performances and the production as a whole. \n\nAnd so it will fade away and get an Oscar for something, the fraud is complete and the game can go on.",

First let\u2019s talk about the good. Pretty much all of the acting is top notch. Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell are all fantastic and deserving of whatever awards they win. Martin McDonagh did a great job of getting the very best performances out of his guys. The plot is also very interesting and allows the film to explore some very complicated themes. Now for the bad. The film covers some very heavy topics and when any film does this, it is important for the audience to believe the world so that these topics are taken seriously. I felt that Sam Rockwell\u2019s character was so over the top that is was unbelievable. This subsequently makes his transformation unbelievable and his transformation is a crucial part of the movie. I feel that most of the characters are a bit over the top is this made some of the scenes and character arcs less believable for me. In the end, the acting and plot are good enough for me to see past the over the top characters, but those problems do keep the film from being something truly special.",

Because 1. the acting is great and 2. critics are so blinded by their politics in 2018 the actual quality of a film doesn't matter.

            "content": "Bordering somewhere between a dark comedy and being overly dramatic, \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is a not-so-feel-good film that takes viewers down unexpected lesser explored roads in our modern film-making era.  The main plot: bereaved mother Mildred Hayes pays for three billboards that blatantly call out the town's police chief as she desperately wants to know why they're not doing more to find her daughter's killer. And from there, a spawn of ideas and emotions get strung out for the viewer to follow along with.  \n\nWhat I mostly loved about this film was 1) that it paints small-town life in the middle of our country in a realistic and beautiful fashion; 2) that Frances McDormand's performance is solid; and 3) that it's presenting a story about reconciliation that I didn't see coming.  But most importantly, 4) the story has multiple layers to its narrative that enrich it more than I'd expected.  For example, at one point a character has ear-buds in and is listening to the song \"Chiquitita\" by ABBA.  When it started, the audience giggled because it seems humorous.  But a few hours  after I saw the film, I looked up the lyrics to \"Chiquitita\" and saw that they fit the story-line at that point in the film so well that I was almost mad at myself for not catching the connection while I was watching it.  Another example: at the beginning of the film, a character is reading the short story collection \"A Good Man is Hard to Find\" by Flannery O'Connor, and that book's title becomes a supporting theme throughout the entire movie. \n\nThe only things that didn't work so well with me were 1) the pervasive language -- after hearing the characters use the F word about 500 times, I was beginning to wonder if we'd run out of words in the English language; and 2) the politics of our current era were a bit more present than I'd have cared for -- Really? The seemingly bad guys are both a racist policeman and a war veteran?  Really?! -- Folks, I go to the movies to escape the pain of our nowadays, not to be reminded of it.  HOWEVER, one thing this movie does that few films pull off is this: you think you're rooting for one or two characters at the beginning of the film, but by the end you might find yourself rooting for the opposite characters.  And this ability to consider all sides of a story, argument, or discussion is something that America desperately needs to re-learn. (On a side-note: the film's writer/director is British.  Just sayin'...)\n\nAll in all: it's an extremely well-made movie, but it was a bit too dark for me to want to watch it again anytime soon.  [3/5 stars]",

An idealistic, uphill battle against the other driving force, the phrase \"Anger begets greater anger\" which seems to win over its opponent for the majority of the film. \n\nEvery action in \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" has a reaction from another character & almost all reactions are of the negative side.

            "content": "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of the greatest films of 2017 and an eye-opening account of a woman trying to seek justice for her daughters death. Set in the small town of Ebbing, Missouri, a woman, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDermond) decides to rent three billboards to bring attention to her daughters rape and murder after no convict was brought forward. She receives a great deal of backlash from the community and the police force which features Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell). All of the performances by these three leads are outstanding, and it is no surprise that they have all been nominated for numerous awards for their roles. Harrelson's character has many other tragedies to deal with in his life besides the case, and is easy to forgive and be sympathetic towards once we find out his entire story. Rockwell's Dixon, is a very racist and ignorant officer, but his story grows dramatically over the entire film. McDermond's Mildred is a very strong woman, but the film does a great job showing her resilience and determination in seeking justice for her daughter. The film is very much a dark drama and gives great insight into what life is like in the small towns of the American south. There is a lot of foul language and unpunished crime, but this is just what life is like in the Deep South. The story is very interesting and sympathetic, and deals with real life issues and tragedies. The pacing is good as events build off one another and storylines connect. The dialogue is also top notch, which the writers and director should be given credited for. The ending leaves many question unanswered but seems a fitting way to wrap up this dark and sympathetic tragedy. Overall, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a masterpiece. The performances are top notch, the writing is excellent, and the film does a great job of shining light on tragedy and small town life in the Deep South from multiple perspectives.",

The dialogue is sharp and the characters are incredibly fleshed out. All three main characters have clear flaws and it makes them such a treat to watch. it helps that the performances are incredible. Frances McDormand (Mildred Hayes) is unbelievable. She's winning all the awards and I get it. It's not just the single best performance of the year, it's one the greatest I've ever seen. Woody Harrelson (Bill) brings a sympathy to his character. He's a cop, who are the group that Mildred is at odds with, but you feel for him and his condition. It's not a major scene, but the one of him and Mildred in the interrogation room is very moving. Sam Rockwell (Jason) does fantastic as the racist, alcoholic officer who seems irredeemable, but turns things around quite nicely, giving him a fully developed arc. The script does a masterful job of balancing the dark, heartbreaking stuff, with just enough comedy. There's a realness to everything that happens that adds so much to it all. Also, I want to commend the people with the smaller roles. Samara Weaving (Penelope) was hilarious, Peter Dinkalge (James) was his great self, and Abbie Cornish (Anne) showed a lot of emotion in her short screen time.\n\nWeaknesses: If I had to pick an issue, it would be the ending. It's not a bad one, but it just kind of feels like it falls a bit flat. As you watch the movie, you're expecting it to lead to something big and instead, it kind of just ends.\n\nOverall: Even with an ending that I wouldn't exactly consider perfect, it doesn't do enough harm to take away from just how incredible this movie is. It's gripping, emotional, and real. It's packed with so many stellar performances and you can't peel your eyes away from it all.",

Director/Writer Martin McDonagh really gets the best out of all his cast in this film. Sam Rockwell, who is always great, was better than his normal brilliance, and a shoe in for best supporting actor. The story is small but shows what a parent who has lost a child is willing to do to capture the perpetrator. I love the mood and fine throughout this picture and can't wait for the next film from McDonagh. The bug negative I had was with the casting of Woody Harleson's wife. She is obviously young enough to be his daughter and had an Australian accent that had no business in the movie. Other than that the film is a triumph and will find plenty of love come award season.

While I do have a problem with how McDormand's character was written, she still gives a fantastic showy performance and Sam Rockwell's character is the only character in the film who \nhas any sort of arc. \n\nMcDonagh's script does a mostly great job at balancing between being very Dark/dramatic and comedic. I do think that there are moments in the movie where dramatic tension was undercut with jokes, at times it felt like he was trying to mimic the Coen Brothers. I also found the some of the writing to be ham fisted at times. \n\nMy biggest problem with this movie though is its ending. After the movie ends I felt that the movie was lacking something. Throughout the film we are building up to something only for the movie come to an abrupt ending. It felt like he was trying to go for a sort \"No Country for Old Men\" ending. \n\nI also had problems with \"No Country for Old Men\" ending but the more I watched it the more I liked it.

The theme is any parent's nighmare, a child murdered, but handled by the folks living in (and just outside) Ebbing, Missouri, the topic is handled with the kind of shaky laugh we all may do when stressed. Sam Rockwell is outstanding, like a train wreck with bodies, we shouldn't look but can't help but look and love what we see. Woody Harrelson also delivers a great performance. The story leaves the viewer planted to the theater seat waiting...an ideal ending for the film. Must see.",

This movie is about a mother whose daughter was murdered 7 months ago and no police advancements had been made.  In anger she rents out three billboards calling out the police.  The rest of the movie is everyones reactions to these billboards.  It is hard to say what happens without spoiling the movie but I'll try.  There was three different explosions, one suicide, five different beatings, someone getting thrown out of a window and a whole lot of swearing.  Frances McDormand (Best Actress) gives a wonderful performance, but there is one main problem.  There is no character development, she stays in the same spot at the end of the movie that she was in at the beginning.  On the contrary, Sam Rockwell (Best Supporting Actor) gives one of the best performances of the year with his racist attitude that changes throughout the movie. The real shining star of the movie is definitely Woody Harrelson(Best Supporting Actor).  He gives the best performance of his career by far.  He is funny and heartbreaking at the same time.",

We follow Mildred as she confronts the police with their failure to find her daughter's murderer and as the extent of the pain of the memories she is dealing with is revealed. Sam Rockwell is, as always, consumed in his character as Officer Dixon; a contemptible, ignorant and racist thug. Although the evolution of the character of Dixon in the film has been criticised, this does not diminish Rockwell's ability as we come to question whether Dixon would be a different man under influences other than his own ignorant and poisonous mother..The emotional ping pong of the script and the beautifully constructed visual images and sequences produce an atmosphere that gets inside your head.",

So in order to focus the mind of locally respected police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) she hires some dilapidated old billboards on a little used road outside the local town of Ebbing, Missouri, USA.\nMcFarland delivers a fantastic performance not only in grief and revenge but a black humour.\nHarrelson starts the film looking as if he will be an unpopular character but when it is revealed he is dying from cancer he displays a more sympathetic and at times humorous performance.\nWilloughby is aided by apparently racist cop, Dixon (Sam Rockwell). Rockwell to delivers a great performance as his character turns from low IQ/racist cop to concerned investigator after his sacking and death of Willoughby.\nI had one major gripe with this film. The debatable ending.\nNow I prefer more black and white endings.\nThe simplistic film title has now caused mass attention and debate after viewing and for this I commend the film.",

I was shocked (by the violence and subject matter), depressed (for almost every character in the movie), and confused (by Peter Dinklage's purpose and by a scene that felt like it was key to the plot, but turned out to be seemingly extraneous). But I also felt satisfied and as always, I was impressed by Frances McDormand and frankly, the rest of the cast. To echo many critics, the movie is beautifully acted all-around and that's its driving force. The writing is a bit too on-the-nose for my tastes and it's fence-hopping between being a dark comedy and a darker drama leaves your vision blurry at times. And the more I look at it, the more I feel like Three Billboards is Martin McDonagh's attempt at a Coen Brothers' movie. But it had solid pacing, subtle use of music, tons of charm, and....Frances McDormand. Would this one stand the test of time? Absolutely not (it'll be a hard-to-remember trivia answer in five years), but it's still worthy of its multiple nominations.",

It felt like a scene from \"In The Heat of the Night\", hell I was waiting for him to say \"They call me Mr. Tibbs!\" (for Christ's sake it's 2017 even in backwater towns in MO, not 1969). The guy who they think is a rapist, why did he confront Frances in the thrift shop? Clearly he did not kill and rape her daughter and clearly he was just passing thru town so he didn't know and could not be upset that Frances allegedly pushed the Sheriff to kill himself (it was a bullshit scene designed to mislead and manipulate the audience). And who are those two to decide to go kill someone for an alleged rape of a different girl he may or may not have committed?!? She's an irredeemably poor excuse for a mother and an arsonist to boot who almost murdered Sam Rockwell and he is a racist, sexist, violent attempted murderer already...if they are looking for justice they should start with themselves. And what kind of hillbilly version of Keystone cops do they have in that town (can't solve a rape case, can't charge a deputy for attempted murder committed in broad daylight on Main Street in front of scores of witnesses, beat up innocent citizens for sport, racist as hell and can't solve an incredibly simple arson case)....hell I'm going to get rich by robbing banks in MO because, according to this film, they are all a bunch of idiots! Also, who drives around with a giant fire extinguisher in their car...I mean that thing is huge? And speaking of huge, she owns a big beautiful house (look at the exterior shots) yet its kind of a shithole on the inside and she watches the local newscast on a tiny tv from the 80's (complete with dials to change the channel)...I mean, a small flat screen is  cheap as chips at Walmart....are you telling me those shit kickers don't have a goddamn Walmart in that town? And speaking of money (Wendy pointed this out) considering that the Sheriff planed to kill himself and leave the family with no breadwinner, was that really the time to waste $5,000 on a freakin billboard? Didn't you think that money could for, um I don't know, perhaps your widow and fatherless daughters instead of a bad and expensive joke...just a thought Sheriff  (I could go on and on but have to get ready for work). This is the worst Best Picture nomination since \"Crash\" won that Oscar (Three Billboard my ass...I'd of settled for one plausable plotline!)",

Months have passed, and the local law enforcement is ready to write the case off as being unsolvable because they have no leads.  She decides to push the issue and rent three billboards so as to remind the police that this isn't just going away.  Now this was one of the movies that I was most looking forward to all year.  It's from Martin McDonagh who has written some of my favorite dark stories not only for the screen, but for the stage as well.  He clearly has some personal demons that he exorcises through his writing, and I highly recommend you take time with both In Bruges and The Pillowman.  This is his new original work, and it did not disappoint.  I know I must sound like a broken record at this point, but I have to say it again: this is yet another movie that was pitched to me as a dark comedy, but it features a subject matter that really didn't allow me to laugh all that much.  That said, I could tell what this movie really was about pretty early on, so I was able to adjust fairly quickly.  This is a pitch black heavy story that is not afraid to get in your face.  It is all brought to life with some knockout performances, especially from Frances McDormand.  This is the best she has been since Fargo (which is saying something), and she is excellent as this tough-as-nails woman with a vendetta.  I don't think there is going to be a whole lot of surprises this Oscar ceremony, because I think that she is a lock to win for Best Actress, and she really does deliver that flooring of a performance.  Also worth mentioning is the performances of the local police force in Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell.  They are effectively playing country folk to the point of being natural, and that makes it all the easier to get into the story.  I do really like how you can see multiple points of view in this and understand where everybody is coming from.  I know this has faced a bit of backlash due to one of the characters having a racist history, and to be fair, there is plenty about this that will make you cringe, but it does make it feel authentic.  Realistically, if you are dealing with people that are this backwater, you're going to see deep seeded racism that has been passed down for generations, and that just is something that you can't tiptoe around.  There is a lot of emotional weight to this, and I could easily see this being translated for a stage production, it is just how Martin McDonagh writes.  This is an uncomfortable drama that has a number of great scenes to it, and I recommend it.",

            "content": "Many people have labelled Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri as one of the best films of the year. Upon seeing it, I can certainly verify that this is a very good film. Academy Award winner Martin McDonagh directs this ambitious flick, which succeeds as a balance of black comedy and harshly realistic drama. The story tells of divorced mother Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) who wages war with the police department with her town, instigated by three, inflammatory billboards questioning a lack of clarity in her daughter's murder case. The film does not sound fun and in many ways it isn't; at points, the film showcases scenes of raw emotion, interspersed with often surprisingly brutal violence. At other times, the film is a deliciously black comedy; the two tones successfully work together, not combating but complimenting eachother. The real achievement of this film is the performances by its veteran cast, led by Frances McDormand whose performance as tragic Mildred Hayes ranges from blunt hilarity to sheer passion and emotion. McDormand is simply fantastic, both determined and defeated; what this actress can convey only in a stare is astounding. Sam Rockwell, an Oscar favourite for his role, is very believable as thuggish cop, Dixon, despite a slightly unbelievable redemption that does come too easy. Woody Harrelson is also great, as are the rest of the cast, despite some, such as Lucas Hedges playing Mildred's bullied son, feeling underused. Three Billboards, though providing us with some incredible scenes and expert cinematography and design, is prone to subplots and tangents, such as Mildred's relationship with her ex-husband, which, while sometimes benefiting the main narrative, sometimes crowd the screen and hinder the film. Halfway through, the film enters a rather chaotic sequence which gives the film a disjointed feel that it fights hard to redeem. \nDespite its mistakes, I find it impossible not to respect this film in its ambition, honesty and deft execution. This film is very funny, but its also very heart-breaking and real. The film is successful in its ambiguity of its characters; characters like Mildred and Dixon are pretty horrible in many things they do, but beneath their acts you can clearly see their motivations and how it is not out of malice that they do what they do, but out of the toxicity of rage and hurt, which McDonagh presents so thoughtfully.\nOverall, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri may not be the best film of this year, but it remains a film that is humorous, delightfully brutal but also very beautiful in its own way, striking and remarkably thoughtful.",

Ebbing is a setting, a myth or archetype of a place where decent people fade in to the background, barely noticed by the bitter denizens of this mythical location.  The angry dominate the foreground, while intriguing multi-dimensional characters, get ignored, beaten or harm themselves.  The movie is engrossing.  The dialogue is taut and the acting is superb throughout.  If you want to bask in existential sorrow with humans desperate for connection but unable to find it, those tossed to the purgatory of regret, of opportunity missed in relationship and profound, unbearable regret, this is your film.  It is powerful, poignant and you will leave with a distinct experience, a take on the film, stirred up and even a bit befuddled.  No clean endings, no clear hero or villain except the unknown assailant who committed the atrocity proclaimed on those 3 billboards. The billboards, they stand like the trinity crying out for something holy, and like a Springsteen song announcing that this is a town for losers, and as a last ditch effort for a mother to find salvation from her own family failings.I recommend the film without hesitation.",

I watched through a series of relentless sadness, unpleasant characters and indefensible actions on all (well, most all) ends, waiting for something to take away from the film, something besides all the misery.   But plot points came and went  without ramification or meaning (e.g., someone starts a serious fire late in the film, everyone knows who did it, but even the culprit's enemies don't press an investigation - why is that?).   And the dialogue is frequently embarrassing, depending on a slew of expletives to show down-to-earthness and anger and ignorance and love.  I'm not kidding, be prepared for a parent to cuss at his little children to show affection.  There are great performances here, but  Ms.McDormand can't compensate for the fact that she plays a relentlessly unpleasant character that stubbornly refuses to develop.",

This is a place populated by small men of dubious morals and intelligence, which include an amusing, bumbling Sam Rockwell and a sanctimonious Woody Harrelson in outlandish dumb cop, twat cop roles.\n\nMcDonagh has a whale of a time poking fun at these hapless, trigger-happy goons, but he never loses sight of the fact that a serious and somewhat grizzly tragedy sits at the centre of the film - not the murder, but the waning lives of Ebbing's miserable players.\n\nBeneath the surface of an admittedly very thick, funny veneer of darkness is a series of tormented, confused souls who each get a chance to grapple with their own touching transformation, tragic misfortune, or both.",

And collectors swoon, because it might be the next big thing. Buy a can of the artist's s***. ..... ..... I think I\u2019ve studied and created a fair amount of art, and I can report that McDonagh has spent his life, not studying art, but swirling his finger endlessly in his own fetid s***, and then flicking it on a wall to see what he\u2019s got. He comes up with stuff from this that people still think is the next big thing. Here\u2019s the key: this method avoids the difficult work of coherent composition, coherency being needed to create the depth of real art. His composition is ragged.

            "content": "What the hell???????? First off, Martin McDonagh has never been to rural America and if he has, he's never spoken to a single person there. Also he clearly didn't get a beer there because no goddamn dive bar would ever serve an $8 beer in rural Missouri. That's New York City prices. It's also clear from the poorly written dialogue, which is unrealistic and bizarre - they all talk like inner city chavs but with southern accents. Americans don't banter the word 'cunt' around to their damn parents in loving jest, lord almighty. Also who the hell writes a suicide note about how wonderful it was with \"me inside of you and you on top of me and barely a fleeting thought of the darkness to come.\" The dialogue in this movie is big-time trash.\n\nThen there's the completely insensitive and equally nonsensical 'commentary' about women, race and cops. All broken up with moments of tone-deaf levity because ha-ha we're all here to have fun and learn, guys! For a movie that's about a woman who was raped and murdered by being set on fire, it clearly doesn't give a shit about her. The only scene we see is how this daughter calls her mom a cunt and says \"I HOPE I GET RAPED\" before she leaves the house. Wow great character building.\n\nAnd as for the racial commentary.... theres like three black characters here who are all interchangeably nondescript and then there's \"Latino 1\" and \"Latino 2\" in the cast list which I think kinda shows you the depth of the 'commentary' there.\n\nTHEN you have the 'bad cops' who are dumb as bricks and violent because gosh darn tootin' thats just what they do! And like, listen, there are SO MANY corrupt cops out there in real life, but to dismiss them as so stupid they wouldn't be able to tell if a windowed building they're inside of is being fire bombed until it was too late like.... It undercuts any actual points you want to make about police violence. These idiots exist and there's plenty of real life examples with real life 'excuses' and 'explanations' for why they act like disgusting pigs. Why did McDonagh feel the need to sketch from his head when theres literally stacks of real life material to work from?? Why would you throw those real life examples (that you can find by even googling like 'police violence,' bare minimum) out of the window for a wile e coyote-styled violent casual racist with no rhyme or reason other than stupidity the likes of which doesn't even exist. And then take that character and save HIM and redeem HIM of all characters at the end of this waste of time? Nothing changes for the mother what so ever but this motherfker gets a redemption arc and all of the spotlight at the end of the film??? Wow, great and wonderful. Glad this movie that was meant to be about a raped and murdered young woman solves a lot of things for this idiot man and allows him to grow.\n\nSpeaking of - then this movie ENDS as if the entire point of this garbage fire was just a lead up prequel for Dirty Harry: Missouri or some shit. like, cool. Great. White people working together. Im so glad this overly progressive yet stoic 'rural'-caricature of a mother of a murdered woman and this racist cop who threw a man out of a window could see eye to eye. God bless America.\n\nWhat a waste of time and talented actors doing their worst. I can't handle movies like this that treat their audience like morons.",

The vivid depiction of characters, meticulously rendered storyline, implicit yet overwhelming emotion presented by the main characters, each of the above added together to form the solid structure of the movie. Yet, what captivated me the most was the conflicting human nature.\n \nMildred's aloofness and Dixon's toughness were their strongest shields which formed as they walk through thorns and thistles in life. But who we really are is a question we sometimes don't even know we are asking. \n\nRight vs wrong, evil vs righteousness, two scenes with one Dixon threw Red out of the window and another one where Dixon safeguarded the investigation file. Soft vs hard, warm vs cold, Mildred's response when Willoughby told her that he had cancer and Mildred's reaction when seeing Willoughby cough blood. It was so clearly presented that they are, and we all are, much more complicated than we think. One could argue that their personalities have changed. I prefer the idea of \"to be, or not to be\". The deepest question for a human soul to answer lingers on after the movie was finished with the final question asked: \"Are you sure about this? (killing this man)\". \n\nI wouldn't recommend the movie to those who want a chill night and a few laughs before going to bed on a Saturday night, but for those who are always exploring the deep conflict of human nature, it's not a movie you could bear to miss.",

At the end of the film, I think the director could have gone further and I would have liked a good 'ol hand to hand fight between the mom and her daughter's killer. The film kinda leaves the audience hanging at the end for a real resolution.\nThis was an impactful film but thankfully not too impactful.

Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri takes this to heart, beginning well after the murder that incites the action takes place and after the failed investigation has all but folded. Feeling the world is moving on from her still-burning rage, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) rents the titular billboards, personally shaming police chief William Willoughby* (Woody Harrelson), who is dying of cancer and has perhaps the most screenwriterly name ever devised. The billboards scandal ripples throughout the town, perhaps nowhere more than in the police station, where the short-tempered, racist, and punnily-named deputy Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell) gets angry seemingly on Willoughby's behalf. But the driving background behind each character, from Hayes' tragedy to Willoughby's illness to Dixon's racism, are all established quickly, sometimes awkwardly, through dialogue to cut to the chase. Director Martin McDonagh isn't interested in great tragedies nor is he particularly interested in police abuse. He's interested in how communities function, how defensive they can be to social upset, how putting their members into boxes begets violence. But maybe a bit of interest in the former would have helped.\n\nThree Billboards has been marketed as a black comedy, but never finds an even tone, oscillating drastically between wallowing in melodrama and poking fun at bumpkins. Sometimes this tonal whiplash works: when Mildred's violent ex-husband escalates a situation only to have it defused by his young girlfriend cluelessly asking for a restroom, McDonagh keeps the scene going for a hilariously uncomfortable amount of time. At another moment, a sudden intrusion of Willoughby's illness during an interrogation provides the most intimate moment of the film. However, while a few of the performers find the right nerve to strike (notably the now-ubiquitous Caleb Landry Jones and Samara Weaving), many others never quite find it. Some, like Peter Dinklage's alcoholic salesman, serve one scene and otherwise hang out on the margins, which does give the town a nicely lived-in feel. But others, notably Abbie Cornish as Willoughby's far-too-young and implacably accented wife, feel air-dropped in from a movie-of-the-week. Compared to McDonagh's fantastically odd and dark In Bruges, Three Billboards is just too sincere to read as comedy.\n\nThree Billboards commits to its second-act focus in the end, arguably cutting to black pre-climax. But before it gets there, it engages in some acts of forgiveness that have caused a fair amount of controversy, of which a lot of digital ink has already been spilled. A lot of it comes down to whether a certain act is read as redemption or a step forward, and for my money the film engages with the difficulty of redemption even after attaining self-awareness. It builds up a racial element only to unharmoniously sweep it under the rug, but it rather frankly asserts that atonement isn't simple. The parallels it draws between its two most broken characters are legitimately interesting, although handled less-than-deftly. Thanks to the character of Ebbing itself, it's certainly not a boring ride to get there. It's just not as riveting as the material could have been.",

It makes you feel for every character, and when one comes through redemption you too do not hate that character anymore.

Very Coen-esque, and not just in that it stars Frances McDormand, who's appeared in half a dozen of their films and is actually married to one of the brothers. Most notable is the way director/screenwriter Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) gets us familiar with dozens of rounded, colorful characters, fleshes them out and makes us care about how their paths intertwine. Or, in most cases, how they collide, break apart and ricochet into the next unsuspecting object. This really gets going in the second act, when a core character makes a profound decision that results in a solid hour of nonstop chain reactions. But it's not all dark gristle and angry monologues. Often, it works as an effective black comedy, which I realize is a tough thing to recognize after admitting it's about a rape investigation. Such tension-breakers are crucial, though, to keep us from getting too bogged down in the solemnity of it all, and to maintain a sense of momentum. Wonderfully shot, with plenty of time dedicated to exploring the beat-up small town at the center of all the drama, it's also expertly paced, brilliantly acted and continuously surprising. A deserved favorite for the Oscars.",

With Three Billboards, he's trying to marry that authenticity with a heightened sense of storytelling, specifically in the stylized dialogue and detailed characters. This exercise results in some inescapable messiness throughout the movie, yet there's so much compelling and highly entertaining filmmaking on display here you barely notice.\nMcDormand turns in a powerhouse performance as a vengeful Midwestern mom who buys three billboards in her town that shame local law enforcement for not doing enough to find the man who raped and killed her daughter. With dark subject matter and colorful humor bedding together, it's not an easy movie to take in. Yet despite the film's groove taking a minute to find, those complexities that make it difficult are what make it great. A lovely look at what small-town America really acts like, the characters' motivations and intentions are revealed slowly, and there's not a bad performance in the bunch. Harrelson's character is strongly upright yet deeply sad, and Rockwell brings immense depth to his racist, drunk Barney Fife role.\nAnd the film's edges are as rough as its characters. Metaphors are thinly veiled, characters change when needed, subtext becomes text. However, because the movie, at its core, is just a morality tale, everything is there to support its main point: tragedy changes lives, but vengeance destroys them. And luckily that central message is more open-ended, allowing the movie to sit with its audience long after the individual issues have been washed away.",

That fantastic element doesn't fit the rest of the frame. His answer to their racism is that being a good cop is all about \"love\"-yet how loving is it to only teach them that *after* you die, *after* the cop has thrown someone out a window and brutally tortured a POC? Oh, and let's get to that: The movie is racist. Not just the cops in the movie; the movie itself. All the suffering experienced by the black characters means nothing to them-they just bounce back with a smile, la-di-da, here I am back from a false arrest without another word to say for it-rather, it only occurs for the benefit of the white characters. And even then, the white characters don't quite grow from it, their redemption remaining utterly repugnant.",

Whether amongst McDormond's hate filled mission she takes time out to put a upside down bug back on it's feet to screaming at the Chief Of Police than instantly finding common humanity amongst tradegy.\nA story of good people all reacting to circumstances that life has handed them and acting accordingly the only way they know how from their grass roots.\n\nIt's truly a stand out out performance by Francis McDormand that has to earn her a Oscar Nomination she's frankly that good. Her face never stops working, when ever she's spoken to her face is still processing, expressing and captivating a woman in constant torment from the first shot to the end she's working 100%.\nWoody Harrelson is on top form delivering a performance which like the film is comedic and sad with also one of the best character arks of the narrative along side Sam Rockwell as the racist child like deputy who does some growing up on the way.\nThis is storytelling unlike anything were normally used to from Hollywood. It's Bold, Engaging, Risk Taking Power House Drama that will surprise and leave you pondering long after it ends.\nIt won't be everyone's cup of tea but that is defiantly the point.",

The acting - most notably from McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell, and other support is solid - is a strength.\n\n\"Okay\" points: I didn't mind the ending itself, and really didn't want to see additional 'resolution' to this story...was happy it ended. I don't mind that they attempted humor, and was mostly okay with coarse language. At least, I'm not automatically turned off (or on) to it.\n\nThe bad points? Where to start. The humor just did not work. Very little of it provided relief and most of it was not too clever (even though fairly acidic in most cases) or appropriate to the situation. I think that this writer/director was MUCH too impressed with himself and did not care too much about the intelligence and conscience of his viewers, or about weighty issues that he \"explored\" in a half-assed way.  This was NO \"Fargo\" - an inventive masterpiece of dark humor. This movie - a quip or two aside - was not funny, and not humorous.\n\nLessons learned? In this town, you can hurl Molotov cocktails at a police station and almost kill the (racist scumbag admittedly, till his miraculous epiphany) former cop inside and suffer no consequences.  In this town, you can (if a racist scumbag cop) beat an innocent man almost to death in broad daylight across from the police station and suffer no consequences other than losing your job - and turning in your badge when you get around to it.  You can also (though kinda justified...kinda) kick high school students in their privates with no recriminations. And on and on...\n\nThis film mostly worked for me as I watched it, but as I reflect on it...just one day later...the script was bad, and it was written from a very dark place - without any real depth to it.",

First things first...when is this movie supposed to be set? the time period was very confused. The ambulance looked as though it was present day but some of the stylisation of peoples homes looked like it was from the 80's and 90's. On top of that some of the attitudes of the police charcters was like something out of the 1920's or 1950's. On that issue, I am sorry I don't believe that aspect of the story was true to life at all. That the police are these open racists modelled on something from the era of segregation. That aspect of the story was too far fetched. Yes there are racists in the modern times but they are subtle and hidden, not these 2-D predictable characters. I really like sam rockwell and he has a natural affinity for providing levity in films however I foud the humour in this film misplaced because the subject matter was so serious it felt out of place. On the good parts of the movie I thought the dialouge was excellent with some really funny lines invloved. There were really interesting characters also. The ending of the movie however is dreadful. To go through all that with such a depressing subject matter to be fobbed off with an 'open to interpretation ending' was a very dissapointing cop out. So in the end because the ending was so dissapointing I apprecited the humour in this movie more because there was nothing left to cling on to. Even although I didn't agree that a movie of such seriousness should have humour so prominent in it. I also thought at certain points the movie was going to be an SJW diversity feauturette but to be fair the movie turned it around and gave fair credence to everyone involved. Apart from all that a very confused movie with a really poor ending.",

Sam Rockwell's Dixon is so hateable and lovable at the same time, but he definitely earns all his awards with that complex performance. The dark comedy is hilarious and the drama is strong.

All-round excellent acting and direction- not a duff character in sight for the whole film- and some memorable characters - we loved Woody Harrelson as Willoughby and Sam Rockwell as Dixon but there's another 6 or more actors who just gave superb performances\n3. really good plotting and script-writing - many times you expect one series of events, and get another, but in such a convincing way, and the characters just keep developing and becoming more complex and more HUMAN as you go- beautifully observed, and the film just doesn't let you get away  with easy binary thinking - you are pulled into the complex lives of humans- their motivations , actions and reactions, and you cannot help  but see them as PEOPLE, whatever your first reactions to the character are.\n3. great cinematography - not a poor choice of shot on show\n4. relevant- contemporary comment on modern America and historical tropes - \n5.  we want to see it again\n\nGO see it folks, you can't go wrong",

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has the perfect balance of character driven movie and script driven movie and addition to this, an unpredictable one. Martin McDonagh; the writer-director, brings out something new in this genre that has never been witnessed, he plays with his characters and tracks like he is juggling and even his short characters too will make you feel for them (Peter Dinklage and Caleb Landry Jones) which shows the range of the characters and the actors. Frances McDormand oozes power like never before; she is brutal, arrogant, sometimes wrong and surprisingly funny. Woody Harrelson is straight out stunning in it but the real trump card is Sam Rockwell; he almost has a parallel role to Frances and he justifies his presence till the last frame. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri stands out alone in its genre for its unpredictable script, brutal characters and amusing conversations.",

It wants to be both a black comedy and tragic drama, but these two genres never fluidly collide, making for an awkward and overall unsatisfying journey. One minute you are grieving for this woman over a very tough subject and the next, someone throws out a deeply unsettling attempt at humor. It all feels too darkly whimsical to give the story the proper due. I don't mind black humor, but I do mind a consistent tone and a more smooth meshing of the genres the film is aiming for. Those not familiar with the directors sensibilities will be left out in the cold and the affect of the film is one with a deep lack of an arc. Frances McDormand is brilliant but her arc is non-existent. Sam Rockwell is the most fleshed out in this film and he will deserve the awards he will undoubtedly win.

It shows the best and worst of human nature and the imperfect beings we are.

It is still a touching, as well as brutal, movie but is let down massively in my opinion by the ending. For me it didn't even feel like an ending, more like the picture cut out and you're still waiting for it. Maybe it was meant to be a clever ending, where we are left to wonder what will happen but it is the wrong choice in my opinion and didn't round off the characters' emotional journeys.",

Estas son las inc\u00f3gnitas que plantea 3 anuncios por un crimen (Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri, 2018), una de las pel\u00edculas que arras\u00f3 en los Golden Globes , incluyendo el premio a mejor pel\u00edcula dram\u00e1tica, y candidatas a llevarse varios premios en la pr\u00f3xima entrega de los Oscars. La trama da inicio cuando Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) luego del asesinato de su hija adolescente decide colocar tres carteles al costado de la autopista dirigida al jefe de polic\u00eda William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) cuestion\u00e1ndolo por su falta de profesionalismo a la hora de investigar el crimen y buscar a los culpables. El simple hecho de la presencia de esos carteles en el peque\u00f1o pueblo campesino de Ebbing, Missouri, generar\u00e1 un gran caos y rechazo no solo por parte del departamento de polic\u00eda sino tambi\u00e9n de gran parte de la poblaci\u00f3n debido a los problemas de salud que afronta el oficial Willoughby, por lo cual por momentos la pel\u00edcula no gira en torno al asesinato de la hija de la se\u00f1ora Hayes sino a las consecuencias de la mera presencia de los tres carteles.\nSi hay algo que no le falta a este thriller es la presencia de humor negro con una gran cantidad de gags y situaciones pol\u00edticamente incorrectas que permiten alivianar la situaci\u00f3n que est\u00e1n viviendo los personajes. \nEs importante destacar las enormes actuaciones de Frances McDormand y de Sam Rockwell quien interpreta a Jason Dixon, un ebrio, violento y racista oficial de polic\u00eda. Ambos obtuvieron estatuillas a mejor actriz y mejor actor de reparto en los Golden Globes y en los Critics' Choice Awards y tienen grandes chances de llevarse tambi\u00e9n un premio Oscar. \n#threebillboardsoutsideebbingmissouri",

            "content": "A film that, on closer inspection, seems to be dissembling much more than it is revealing; distracting, much more than it is amplifying; an awful lot of sound and fury in the end signifying nothing.\n\nThink of Ebbing, Missouri - not a real place, but selected as the more-or-less midpoint, north-to-south of the United States.  Think then of a racist character named Jason Dixon, and reflect on the Mason-Dixon line that once denoted the demarcation for the legality of slavery, once Pennsylvania outlawed it.  Conclude that this film must therefore be about race, and have important and weighty things to say about it; Ebbing, Missouri as microcosm, as synecdoche.\n\nThink about the subversive-seeming scene where wooden structures are burning in a field in middle America.  But here there was no KKK.  It feels like that scene must be undercutting something, must be symbolic of something.  What is it symbolic of?\n\nThink of Woody Harrelson, facing his own immediate mortality in the company of his horses.  Think about how that is symbolic, and of what.  Think of the deer appearing at Frances McDormand's side.  Again, ponder how it is symbolic, and of what.\n\nThink about the specificity of the town name in the title - and think then about Fargo, North Dakota.  Think about Frances McDormand in the starring role.  Consider if there is any reason for this that is not utterly superficial.\n\nThink of a character introduced reading Flannery O'Connor.  Think of Psycho - \"no one comes this way anymore, since they built the highway\".  Reflect again on where this film is positioning itself in a literary canon.\n\nConsider the themes the film purports to be about - race; rape and murder; cancer; death; grief; vengeance.\n\nThen reflect again.  You're being told at each turn that this film is of an oeuvre; is standing on the shoulders of giants.  You're distracted, again and again, by its referents, its indebtedness.  Examine closely what this film is actually about.  Is it about death?  About cancer?  What about racism?  Is it about vengeance?  About guilt?  About grief?  Think about what exactly about those things is explored, is revealed.\n\nAnd then conclude, finally, that it is about none of these things.  Just because people die in the film does not mean it is about death.  Because someone has lost a daughter does not make it about grief, or guilt.  Subject matter alone cannot lend gravitas to a work - that comes in the reflections and meditations on these things that emerge from the film.  I see none at work here.\n\nJust because a film-maker has seen the films of the Coens Brothers, or Alfred Hitchcock, or Tom McCarthy; or read the work of Flannery O'Connor does not mean he is their equal.  \n\nA film whose ideas are murky, under-cooked; a film maker who knows what he wants to talk about, but without any idea of what he wants to say about these things; and hopes to disguise that truth with flag waving, with sleight of hand, with constant reminders of the works of artists who were clear about what they wanted to say.  This is the work of a confidence trickster - full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",

In today's political climate I do not feel that the character was written into the story very well so that is what docks major points from my review which is a shame. The movie itself was enjoyable and I was having a good time watching Frances McDormand as the grieving with anger mother. I felt that her character was portrayed very well and the same can be said for Woody and Sam Rockwell's performances, I believe I had more issue with the writing than I did Sam Rockwell's performance.

Frances McDormand is superb as the grieving mother of a dead teenager who tackles head on a police department she believes is under performing. One of the police officers is played brilliantly by the ever talented Sam Rockwell. His character is pretty deplorable but there is an interesting story arc in store for him. This film is about redemption and salvation. It's about inaction and the moral decisions we make. There are some story holes but it moves at a pace that still pleases.

            "content": "It takes a film that's small-scaled with a given decision to wait for a home viewing to instead be given a chance to see a theatrical viewing thanks to its growing, literally award-winning reputation, particularly during the helpful awards season. Presenting the latest dramatically crafty cinematic experience that proved theatrically worthwhile is \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\".\n\nThe supposedly dark comic drama tells a crime story that rages war within a small town community between an unsatisfied mother looking for justice and the local law enforcement with a sympathizing, ailing chief. Around the aftermath months of her daughter's death and rape with no justice served due to no culprits turned in, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) took a bold action of renting the three billboards along the town's entrance path with a controversial message directly addressed to the town's revered Chief Wilhoughby (Woody Harrelson). His second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) becomes the bad cop when getting involved with a taste for violence and fueled the war-mongering flames between Mildred and law enforcement.\n\n You'll find \"Three Billboards\" a similar experience to a typical drama with the said dramatic craftsmanship and occasional expressions of the filmic power's peak, and it's the usual pick to hold it off till it's available for a home viewing. But that's the case of underestimating the value that turned out to have a perfect decent scale at the cinema. It's that good of a movie filled with tense and committed emotions along with a touch of unsatisfactory but passable truism, memorably by emotional impact with a gruesome point and sealed fate.\n\nThe only work I've seen of writer-director Martin McDonagh is his short film \"Six Shooter\", and his directorial skills from there had enlarged through the unseen \"In Bruges\" and this film under the consideration that it's easily his best yet with a unique scale that was presented. The atmospheric tone from still wide shots at different angles to a personal aroma perspective is expressed by the elegance in music, with the original score composed by frequent collaborator Carter Burwell (who deserved the current award-winning recognition). There's a sense of perfection in those scenes, stylized by excellent cinematography, with a fitting jukebox and charming score, displaying the usual powerful peak of one dramatic story with a continuous shot of harsh grief, and difference in lighting from after a pivotal flashback.\n\nOne of the few main factors that drawn me into seeing this film is the cast glorifying the reputation with their excellent performances into really good characterization. The performances of the cast really has a way of putting a spectator in their shoes within their spaces to separately feel their mentality and reacting to their actions that are gripping and unnecessarily irrational - with one action being formulaically predicted based on the heat of the case. The obvious standouts are McDormand and Harrelson, and Rockwell in particular as the latter radiated a lot of energy into his provoking actions while the former shows conflict in her ideal emotions that are understandable.\n\n\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" excels with a storytelling value that teaches filmgoers to not underestimate one film by its scale. It consists impressive cinematography from craftsmanship and aesthetic direction that positioned the three billboards in a symbolic meaning, along with the human soul counterpart bringing out emotional performances from its excellent cast. Although it could've been rated higher if it weren't for the irrational acts despite that they proved pivotal to where it ended up and make the film beautifully powerful with grit, which genuinely makes this one of the very best of 2017.

            "content": "Following my viewing of the Golden Globes, and more recently, the SAG awards, I decided that watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri would most likely be a good idea. The film has performed exceptionally well so far this awards season, consistently winning many of the awards it was put up for. After being fortunate enough to see it, I can understand why.\n\nI feel it is worth quickly adding that, while watching this film, I was quite tired. I'd seen Coco earlier that same day, and I rarely go out for that long a period. The fact that the film still made such an impact on me in that state is impressive.\n\nOrdinarily, this isn't the sort of film I'd be attracted to. I didn't really recognise many of the actors going in, nor was it based on an existing property. To put it bluntly, it was a proper, standalone film. After seeing it, I was genuinely impressed.\n\nOrdinarily, I would list highlights of a film, then delve into the issues. Now, however, I'm perplexed; the film did everything well, at least to an extent. There was only a few things I found issue with. The CGI (which was used incredibly sparingly) was often rather jarring. It didn't fit with the rest of the gorgeously shot world. Though the locations are never astounding, Ben Davis makes even relatively mundane countryside look beautiful.\n\nThe characters shown within this film are rather fascinating. The events leading up to the film could almost be a film in themselves. Despite what reading a synopsis may imply, however, this film isn't a murder mystery. The murder of Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand)'s daughter isn't the focal point of the film. Instead, the main focus of the film is how the event impacts various people, and how they go on to deal with it. Each main character is rather layered, and could arguably be the lead in their own film.\n\nBringing these characters to life is a brilliantly talented cast. Frances McDormand deserves each award she receives. I feel the trailer actually does her character a disservice; after watching it, I felt that she was simply a vulgar, hateful woman taking her frustrations out on those around her. In reality, she's a far more sympathetic character, who isn't nearly as abrasive as the trailer makes her out to be. Woody Harrelson's Chief Willoughby was probably my favourite character of the film, who, despite playing the straight man in many scenes, is able to bring levity and humour to the dark situations in which he finds himself. Sam Rockwell's Dixon is also wonderful, though many people have taken issue with his character's arc. Personally, I enjoyed it greatly, though it's something to note.\n\nMany of the supporting characters are hit or miss. I feel Peter Dinklage was brilliantly funny, though some of the others failed to steal a chuckle from me. The rest of the audience seemed to enjoy them, however, so it's most likely a fault of my own.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how violent this film is; the trailer makes it seem that violence is a punchline to a joke, but at times, the movie is genuinely brutal. It's probably more violent than most modern horror films.\n\nThe soundtrack was actually rather enjoyable. The original scoring was great, and fit the setting perfectly. The other songs added each served their purpose, oftentimes accentuating the comedy within a scene.\n\nFor the most part, I found the writing great. The characters spoke like real (if dramatised) people, though occasionally there was some odd lines.\n\nTo conclude the review, I feel this was a truly impressive film, and I understand why it's getting so many nominations. If you love film, I must recommend you give this one a watch. Thankfully, this isn't one you need to see in the cinema; I think it could work just as well on a smaller screen. If you need a concrete ending, however, you may need to steer clear; it's rather open ended. I feel Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri deserves a 9/10, and I look forward to seeing more films of a similar quality to this one.",

This is one of Best 5 this year, a serious political drama against a corrupt government and comedy, a bit too much violent like Quentin Tarantino or Takeshi Kitano. Last December I went to the Play The Beauty Queen of Leenane written by Martin McDonagh. 1996 Olivier Award nomination and Best leading Actress of 1998 Tony Award winner. The Queen's Mather on westcoast of Ireland looks like Dixon's Mother at Ebbing. Frances McDormand exists in Almost Famous, Mississippi Burning and Fargo. Mildred must be a local Wonder Woman of Hope, fighting Ailens. Missouri recalls Winter's Bone, Jennifer Lawrence, Scots-Irish in rural Ozarks. A countryside images North Dakota of The Cut by Fatih Akin. Justice makes her drive on the right way with a partner. We can learn the real life going on. Welcome to my twitter @cinemawishtokyo.",

This probably colors my review some, but not completely.\n\nOverall, what struck me is how much hate and anger there is in the movie.  There is tons of strong cursing, including using certain words that are pretty much never used in movies.  There is blatant racism.  There is homophobia.  There are dwarf jokes. It portrays law enforcement in a very negative way. There are multiple acts of extreme violence that are somewhat stunning to imagine.  You put all of this together and I just had a hard time enjoying the movie where pretty much all of the characters are vile.  Overall, it portrayed America at its worst touching on nearly every sensitive topic in society today.\n\nThe ironic thing is I like movies like Tarantino movies that have harsh language and tremendous violence. I think what made this movie less enjoyable is those movies tend to be fanciful and I don't think of them as reality, whereas this movie comes across like it is portraying every day life in small town America and, in that context, these things are hard to bear.\n\nThere were a number of strong performances, but I just couldn't enjoy the movie.  It was just too dark and cynical for my palate.",

I challenge anyone to give me a coherent plot summary.

After Woody Harrelson shoots himself, we are treated to, not one, not two, but three different suicide letters read in his voice over, which he TOTALLY PHONED IN.\n\n5. As stated before, the plot is all over the place. My wife and I kept turning to each other and asking, \"What is going on???\"\n\n6. Woodey Harrelson' s young model wife whose performance was almost as boggling as her bizarre Australian/Missouri accent.\n\n7.

The story revolves around Mildred Hayes who is disillusioned with the local police force\u00e2??s attempts to track down her daughter\u00e2??s killers. She rents 3 billboards where her daughter\u00e2??s body was found to provoke the police into action. \r\nFirstly let\u00e2??s start with the cast; Mildred who is played by Francis Mcdormand is a power house. She plays a very real believable character who takes you on this journey. All moments of real gravitas or levity are centred through Mildred so anything less than a stellar performance could sink this story. Francis \u00e2??performance is the centrepiece (rightly so) of this impressive indie film and cards on the table I believe she will win best actress at the Oscars in a few weeks. Sam Rockwell once again picks clever indie films and at times and at times steals most of the scenes he is in. He plays the sometimes deplorable Jason Dixon and at times ignorant police officer. What McDonagh and Rockwell managed to take this character on a journey from irredeemable to someone your almost feel for. Woody Harrelson gives a real heartfelt performance and is one of his better roles from recent memory.  The rest of the supporting cast including peter Dinklage are also on form here.\r\nMartin McDonagh ultimately has written and directed beautifully one of my favourite films of 2018 and we are in January!! The story is simply gripping and it never goes into too much detail about Mildred\u00e2??s daughters demise which I feel is a clever move. This film feels like there is no real resolution, no finish with a tidy bow on top which grounds this in reality and plays out exactly how this film needed too. \r\nTo conclude Three Billboards is a film that has real heart that will make you laugh , cry and everything in-between.",

Non ci sono personaggi positivi, ognuno di loro dimostra a gran voce la profonda verit\u00e0 nascosta dentro l'essere umano, tema che mi ha ricordato molto le riflessioni sull'uomo dei fratelli Coen. Il difetto principale del film \u00e8 un umorismo finto e convenzionale, che mi ha fatto storcere il naso pi\u00f9 di una volta. Le emozioni arrivano soprattutto nella parte finale, in cui l'evoluzione degli splendidi personaggi raggiunge livelli inaspettati e nuovi. Mi aspetto grasse candidature agli oscar, soprattutto per attori e per la cinica sceneggiatura.",

            "content": "From the writer/director that brought you Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges, Martin McDonagh has made his finest film yet in 3 Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. It is the blackest of black comedies punctuated with genuine moments of anger, sadness, fear and suspense.\n\n7 months after the death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes takes matters into her own hands placing controversial ads on three billboards outside her town of (you guessed it) Ebbing, Missouri. 7 months and not arrests for the murder of her daughter and her finger (and billboards) are pointed right at the widely respected chief of police Bill Willoughby. This sets off a chain of events that has consequences in store for all that have a part to play in the incident, from the grieving family to the clueless police force. \n\nThis film has three standout performances that propel this film beyond its premise. Woody Harrelson is brilliant as the small town sheriff with the heart of gold, his humanity and rye humour ground you in the reassurance that while McDonagh is taking a far darker route than his previous two films, the rich vein of wit is still present in Three Billboards.\n\nSam Rockwell is one of the finest actors in Hollywood with an incredible depth of range in countless performances, this one could be his best yet. Rockwell, plays Jason, a local cop with a short fuse who causes more problems than he solves. \n\nFrances McDormand really shines in this film as Mildred, her harsh exterior and dry dialogue hides a woman who is deep in grief and she tows the line between these two things perfectly.\n\nI honestly can't fault this film at any point, anyone who has seen McDonagh's two previous films will know the man is an impeccable writer who creates dialogue that actors would love to say on a daily basis. He has not yet put a foot wrong on the silver screen and this is probably his best film to date when he wants to make you laugh he does, when he wants to get you thinking you think and when he wants you gripped by visceral scenes of violence and suspense, you are on the edge of your seat. I can not recommend this film enough to anyone who has a passing interest in cinema, believe this is two hours not wasted.",

            "content": "A rare gem that I wish I saw before 2017 ended. \n\nAfter months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Academy Award winner Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Academy Award nominee Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police. When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated.\n\nThis was one of those Oscar buzz films that I had no information about prior. I knew nothing about this film other than the fact that numerous amounts of people had told me to watch this. As a film major now, I've done my best to watch everything I can, which has been especially helpful now with MoviePass. Anyways, if I had watched this film before the year 2017 ended, it would've easily made my top films list of the year, as it was certainly one of the best of the year. \n\nTalk about dark comedy because I wasn't expecting this film to have any laughs at all. The comedy is dark, vile, and crude but it works so well. It's easy to push boundaries but to push boundaries in a way that's actually funny and emotional, that's astounding. I was able to have plenty of laughs throughout this film but it never detracted from the story or the dramatic / emotional side of the film. \n\nYes, this is one of those hybrid genres that works so fucking well. It's a comedy mixed with drama, mixed with emotional, mixed with dark, mixed with mystery. It's a character study and a thematic watch that never forgets what it is. It's able to bring all of these elements together without ever detracting from the other. That's such a rarity to have these days; a film that knows exactly what it is but still manages to breed together different genres and emotions. \n\nThe screenwriting was absolutely brilliant in this film. It was unpredictable and an amazing way to tell a story. The dialogue was brilliantly written, along with the interesting characters and intriguing storyline. It's a great screenplay, one that I'm certainly not capable of writing (which isn't saying much). But I think this film will be able to be enjoyed for a variety of reasons, one being the screenplay.\n\nIn general, this was just a great gem. I'm sad I saw it so late but I'm glad I saw it at all. I certainly loved this film and I feel that it's a must see for moviegoers galore.",

            "content": "This is an intense experience. The \"three billboards\" in the title suit the focus of the film very fittingly in a number of ways. These billboards become instruments of the bereavement, frustration, and unrest in the heart of a mother (in a truly epic performance by Frances McDormand) whose daughter had been raped, burned, and murdered several months prior. The audience soon learns that the mother's afflictions are justified as these billboards and the message they are chosen to convey act also as a foreboding introduction to this troubled town and as a catalyst for further events to occur and ancillary tensions to brew. The town is centered around a corrupt and discriminatory police force that has neglected their difficult cases and have yet to find a resolution for the death of the mother's daughter. Simply through this, the billboards are transformed into an advertisement of grief, an intended wake-up call fueled through anger, a symbol of injustice on behalf of the Ebbing Police Department, which leads to what this film is really about. It focuses on and explores the effects of grief and injustice on people and the ones around them while highlighting the extent these people will go to make things right or even just to have closure. The film is very forward and blunt in expressing itself, enough to the point of even feeling a bit offensive. However, throughout the course of the film, things happen, and the audience comes to sympathize with these unforgiving characters and smile at their black humor. Through these feelings, a deeper moral in the film is translucently revealed in that perhaps what this town truly needs is its fair share of love and forgiveness, a realization that would have never come to light had it not been for those three billboards. This is a fantastic and powerful film, deep-rooted in its subject and determined in its message while also clearly and realistically aware that, like many murder cases, grief is never truly resolved. Definite Oscar Best Picture nominee here.",

Even In Bruges's Harry had principles. I would however argue it serves well in your struggle to debate Mildred's closure. McDonagh however has tested our conscious before and it is commonly whether or not we think Colin Farrell should die.\n\nSo could it have been happier? Without a doubt, but should it be changed?

Whether amongst McDormond's hate filled mission she takes time out to put a upside down bug back on it's feet to screaming at the Chief Of Police than instantly finding common humanity amongst tradgedy. \n\nA story of good people all reacting to circumstances that life has handed them and acting accordingly the only way they know how from their grass roots.  \n\nIt's truly a stand out out performance by Francis McDormand that has to earn her a Oscar Nomination she's frankly that good. Her face never stops working, when ever she's spoken to her face is still processing, expressing and captivating a woman in constant torment from the first shot to the end she's working 100%. \n\nWoody Harrelson is on top form delivering a performance which like the film is comedic and sad with also one of the best character arks of the narrative along side Sam Rockwell as the racist child like deputy who does some growing up on the way. \n\nThis is storytelling unlike anything were normally used to from Hollywood. It's Bold, Engaging, Risk Taking Power House Drama that will suprise and leave you pondering long after it ends. \n\nIt won't be everyone's cup of tea but that is defiantly the point.",

Unfortunately, there was just too much exposition on Dixon that I didn't find original and perhaps even stereotypical.  The molotov scene, too, didn't ring true.  It all wrapped up a bit too pat for me.  (One too many logic gaps, as well, that I couldn't get past.)

It seemed off that there was no closure to Dixons character. Although he redeemed himself a bit through trying to catch the murderer, it seemed odd that the story overlooked his big anger issues. The backstory of his character was just swept aside. Then he just became friends with Mildred. Kind of odd. Apart from that I will say that I enjoyed the movie. The actors/actresses portrayed their characters really well. I really enjoyed Woody Harrelsons character! There were some funny moments and some serious moments. Overall I gave the movie a 3.5 star rating. I enjoyed the acting, but would have enjoyed a larger climax and closure towards the end of movie.

            "content": "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri is the 3rd movie directed by Martin McDonagh. And is about a woman named Mildred, who after the police in Ebbing Missouri fail to catch the culprit responsible for her daughters death and rape puts up three billboards asking the chief of police why there have been no arrest in this case. Now because its a small town everybody knows about them the next day. Now certain people are on Mildreds side and certain people are on the side of the police and this town has no problem saying quite a few inappropriate things. But when the spotlight is shown on them fpr being complacent in solving a very important crime while also not being as complacent when it comes to committing other crimes they dont like that. Now I was looking forward to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri because I absolutely adore Frances McDormand and I think Martin McDonagh is a very good director. And I have to say this is one of my favorite films of the year. What makes Three Billboards so great is that though it explores a lot of deep dark territory it has a suprising amount of dark humor to it. And because the film uses the element of dark humor to tell its story it makes it sort of easier to watch. Another great aspect to Three Billboards is the performances especially from France McDormand. This movie was hands down her best role since Fargo (1996). In all honesty they could not have gotten a better person for this role. In my opinion McDormand should absolutely wim an Oscar this year for this movie. Also Sam Rockwell is another actor in this film who does a great job. But not only because of his performance but because his character definitely has the best arc in this movie. But aside from McDormand and Rockwells performances the films suporting cast of Woody Harrelson, Lucas Hedges, Abbie Cornish, John Haynes, Peter Dinklage, and Kathryn Newton all do an excellent job as well. Now the best part about this movie is the fact that its completely unpredictable. Like there are literally times in this movie were you think you know where somethings going but it doesn't go that way. In fact while watching the movie I just stopped trying to predict where it was going because its that unpredictable. Now Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri is absolutely not for everyone. And I say this because not only is the film dark and depressing. But because it is very politically incorrect. And though the film is politivally incorrect to prove ots point it can come off as offemsive to some. In fact some of the things that are said in this movie I was utterly shocked by with how they got away with. However you may not even care because the acting is so on point and the films story is so investing. Now I do have one flaw with this movie however its sort of a spoiler so I just wont say it in this review. In the end Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri was excellent. The film was tense, it was emotional, and even funny at time (I'll admit i laughed more then i expected with this one). If you are looking for an original, well acted, unpredictable film with great characters and that will keep you guessing till the very end I highly recommend Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri to you I gurantee you will not be disappointed.",

The center of the story, from a plot perspective, was Mildred's relationship with the police (individuals and the force more broadly), but her character was totally incoherent on this fundamental lever. The police are overstepping in torturing black suspects and busting her friend for nonsense, but also need to create a national DNA registry? Her son should have had more to do, though the actor may not have been up to it. Every black character was a mannequin, existing only as an avatar to signal the goodness of various (white) townsfolk and not as characters in and of themselves. Finally, there too GD many characters. Are we really adding Peter Dinklage for two scenes and a whirlwind fight in the final act? Zoo girl? Cedric? It was distracting.",

Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell also had some very funny, sometimes serious chemistry in the scenes that they were in together, and it was very entertaining to watch. Sam and Woody also performed wonderfully individually as well, and both of their characters really engaged me. One scene I especially loved involved Francis McDormand's character and a beautiful dear, and I am not going to reveal why, but it was heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time. Three Billboards was a very emotionally moving and powerful movie with a storyline full of twists and turns along the way, and although I did enjoy I, Toyna slightly more, this movie was truly a great cinematic experience. - 90%",

McDonough got his start in theater but this is his third feature film. Before this he has directed In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths and he has already developed a clear style. His scripts focus around very complex characters who find themselves in dark and at times humorous situations. \n\nMcDonough has been able to get the very best out of his all star casts in each of his films and Three Billboards is no different. The cast is absolutely phenomenal in this film. Each plays off the next eloquently never stepping over each other. Each character's through line makes sense and feels honest to the character. They never do anything just to advance the story or to directly benefit any of the other characters. \n\nMcDonough uses Carter Burwell once again to score his film. Burwell seems to have a grasp on the atmosphere McDonough is going for here and compliments it perfectly. My only slight qualm would be that there are moments where the score sounds eerily similar to previous scores Burwell has done for McDonough. Especially the score for In Bruges. \n\nIt is very easy for people to be off-put by McDonough's writing style. It is excessively vulgar and has no sense of restraint. But his characters are honest and sincere. They feel real and they have important things to say. If you are not someone who generally enjoys this style I would still implore you to watch this film.

The open ending can sometimes work but absolutely doesn't. After creating such a convoluted and slightly soppy second half to the film, the plot becomes drained of intellect, so why then leave an open ending. The director has already nailed his emotions to the mast, so at least give us the stupid, rousing ending the film seems to be hurtling towards. Instead, having already created a ridiculous build up, the film then ends without the courage to let us know whether the characters have been truly reformed by the chaos that has preceded.

The humanity is totally stripped from the victim and her character is used as a MacGuffin of sorts, and there is no resolution or redemption to any of the mess. Some powerful scenes were already in the trailer and made more sense out of context. Most scenes had characters who only felt what the scene called for them to feel at that moment, and the depth of their character was constantly undermined by the almost vignet-like quality to the scenes. At one point, the protagonist's ex husband makes an unexpected visit, her son is VERY enthusiastically excited for this unannounced visit, (he's in his late teens,) and this encounter turns into an almost brutally violent assault where the same son is prepared, almost as if it were normal, to slash his father's throat. Later, all characters behave as if nothing happened. This type of thing happens many times throughout the film.\n\nThis film is a consequence-free experience for every character, while the main plot device is allegedly an attempt at seeking consequences for perpetrators of injustice.

Frances McDormand's Mildred Hayes is full of humor, pain, and restraint at various times; a masterclass, for sure. Woody Harrelson gives an excellent character turn with lots of heart; a performance that keeps on giving. But the hidden gem that you only discover in the third act is Sam Rockwell's performance as Jason Dixon, a stereotypical racist redneck cop that has the biggest arc of any character.\n\nThis film is written very well, except for a few times when characters seem much wittier than they should be, or a certain phrase pops up word for word from two characters with no real justification. There's a hell of a lot more comedy than you'd expect from a film about a mother demanding justice for a murdered child. \n\nThe film is well shot, with a handheld camera used during a particularly unhinged action sequence, giving you a sense of the loss of control. \n\nIt does have a slight twinge of Oscar Bait to it, and it's a bit on the nose with the social commentary, especially in the first act. As we go further into the story, the characters grow on you, thanks to the amazing acting performances by the supporting cast as well as the three mentioned at the top.

When you know that the only real part of the movie are the billboards which were in a small town in the south, the movie becomes much more about how the writer (and I would imagine Hollywood in general) views rural and small-town America. I enjoyed the movie at first when I thought all the injustice in this town was being exposed (it was inspired by true events after all). However, it was so farfetched that I had to look it up. When I found out none of it happened, it just becomes the usual moral signaling from immoral Hollywood and specifically the writer Martin McDonagh. It's interesting all the stereotypes he uses as he tries to point out the injustice of stereotypes. One of the more notable ones was the scene with the Catholic priest. The overly romantic view of suicide really didn't sit well with me. The scene with the dentist was probably supposed to be funny, but was just unrealistic and extremely dark when you know it wasn't something that actually happened (but who cares since \"no one cares about Dentists\"). While I didn't like the messaging of the movie, the elements of movie making were done well. If you have the same hopeless view of life as McDonagh, then you'll probably love it as the main character uncompromisingly backs down from no one while taking on all manner of abuse and injustice.",

Moonlight last year suffered from the exact same effect. \n\nThe whole premise of the billboards is just plain dumb; she singles out the police chief for not making arrests when there was zero evidence to convict anybody. That's literally how the law works. He tells her this and she doesn't offer any valid solutions. And yet despite this, and despite the fact that the person she singled out is dying, she still keeps the boards up, coupled with her generally shitty attitude, just makes one care very little about this protagonist, who we're supposed to sympathise with (I think??).\n\nFurthermore, the film shifts backwards and forwards in tone so much that its hard to distinguish exactly what its trying to be. There were scenes that were so crazy in the sense that I think they were played for comic value, but they just came across as awkward and bizarre. At one point, Dixon, walks right across the street, beats a kid up to a pulp and throws him out of the window, in front of not only several witnesses including the police chief, but his own police station, before returning and closing the door. He was later reluctantly fired. Fired. Sorry, but that man would have been arrested on the spot for battery and attempted murder. I know corruption, negligence and police brutality is a problem in the states, but that whole scene was just straight up bonkers. Furthermore, this very same character suddenly develops a redemption complex that we're supposed to sympathise with, and its so out of left field that its just plain confusing.     \n\nWhat's more is that the film tries to bring up themes like racism, but instead of actually providing much needed commentary on it, it just merely mocks the fact that one of the officers was known to be a white supremacist who beats up black people and gets away with it. The actual concept of these actions is literally used in a scene for comedic effect. This, coupled with the fact that they brought Peter Dinklage (a bloody good actor) in just so they could throw around some midget jokes for kicks, shows you the level of competence in the humor department for this film. \n\nThe more I think about this film, the more I dislike it. Even the name is pretentious. Don't be fooled by the buzz.",

            "content": "I want to start by saying right off the bat this is not a comedy.  Despite it's label of being both that and a drama, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is most assuredly a heavy drama tinged with some black comedy instead of the other way around.  There's a reason it was included in the best picture category or dramas.  With that out of the way, Three Billboards is one of the best acted films of 2017.  Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, go ahead and add this to the list of his already stellar list of obscure, small-town, odd-ball films.  I've reviewed nearly all his films from The Guard to In Bruges to Seven Psychopaths; all of them are just as enjoyable as the last.  \n\nWhat makes Three Billboards a little skewed from that small sample size of films is the focus on a more serious event.  This is a movie not for the faint of heart.  It draws on a terrible occurrence within a town still beating with a smidge of racism, homophobia, and prejudice from many of its town folk.  Mildred Hayes, played by the wonderful and possibly soon-to-be award winner Francis McDormand, has lost her daughter to a rape and murder.  With the case still unresolved, she takes to three billboards on the outskirt of town on a road less traveled to put forth a challenge to the police.  It's a wonderful act of defiance from a character we may not love in the end, but certainly can admire and respect along the way.  McDormand doesn't quite play Hayes as someone with nothing left to lose, but it falls more into focused recklessness.  She has a clear mission in mind with revenge being the most prominent.\n\nThe cast outside of McDormand is top notch.  Sam Rockwell plays a scummy, ignorant cop, but his character arc by the end of the movie almost turns him into affable.  There's a scene Rockwell delivers with such intensity about halfway through the movie that it leaves you a little shaken knowing he's probably not far from reality.  It's easy to see why he should also be up for some supporting awards playing Officer Jason Dixon.\n\nThe rest of the cast from Woody Harrelson, Abbie Cornish, Lucas Hedges and company are firing on all cylinders even if their screen time is limited.  McDonagh even came out and said this movie was doomed if McDormand wasn't going to be in it, and you can easily see why she is the rock of the cast.\n\nHowever, despite offering us an in depth look at a small town in Missouri and focusing on the fallout from one particular event, I felt a little aimless toward the end without a finite resolution.  McDonagh may have spent plenty of time on getting his main characters to interact, but I was left hoping for a bit more inclusion of some of the minor townsfolk to really engross me in the environment.  The open ended finish felt a little to parallel with McDonagh's mindset; he probably didn't quite know how to tighten everything up himself.\n\nOutside of the gruesome events leading up to the reason for the main plot and the harsh language used to  exemplify a bit of the times in a small-town setting like Ebbing, Missouri, Three Billboards leans heavily on its cast to push the drama while using well written dialogue and well placed droplets of black comedy to keep it from becoming too overbearing.  Whether some vote getters think it's too controversial for best picture, it certainly deserves to see a nomination.",

Humour is perhaps our most essential tool for discussing the dark issues we face in life, and this is a movie filled with Writer/Director Martin McDonagh's trademark dry wit and talent for combining scathing comedy with serious subject matter. Frances McDormand is a terrific lead, full of venom and thinly-veiled bitterness, scowling and sneering at those who wrong her. Her situation is understandable, as is her consternation at what she sees as a slack approach to it from her local police force, which she goes head-to-head with. Brilliant supporting roles are provided by Woody Harrelson and especially Sam Rockwell, who is the quintessential snivelling, ignorant bigot, who is given a chance to grow beyond his raw hatred and finally do some good with his life. The story itself seems to take too many digressions in the 3rd act, but I liked the uncertainty upon which it ended, and the questions it forces the audience to ask. I don't mind a perfectly happy ending it if feels right and fits the tone, and it certainly wouldn't have here. The jokes are, in keeping with the material, harsh and even cruel, but what's being presented is unpleasant, and the movie never tries to lampshade it. It never feels overlong and surprises keep popping out of nowhere. Being a huge fan of In Bruges, McDonagh's cinematic debut, I'm glad to see he is keeping the tradition of highly observant dark comedies alive.",

            "content": "At some point, I bet you've been in a conversation with a person who made a crass or racist comment, one which was inappropriate, offensive, or even hateful. In response to the incredulous stares or angry reactions at the comment, this person opens their arms in apparent surrender, a sheepish-yet-smug look on their face, and says something like, \"What? I was only joking. You're being too sensitive.\" They may mutter something about how \"Everything is so P.C.\" these days, or how folks don't appreciate dark comedy. Perhaps this person is a family member or co-worker, someone you find yourself around in social situations on a regular basis. Perhaps this is life-draining for you due this person's tone-deaf lack of self-awareness, not to mention their inability to empathize or understand others around them.\n\nWatching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is like spending two hours with that tone-deaf jerk without the ability to have a fruitful dialogue or relationship-you can only listen to their offensive monologue without being able to respond. Even if their arguments are eloquent or passionate, it's exhausting (at best) and infuriating (at worst). Director and writer Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) has some Important Things to Say; he's written the message in all caps and with plenty of f*cks to get our attention.\n\nThese f*cks spew forth from Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) with bitter vitriol. She's made a permanent dwelling in the \"Anger\" stage of the Kubler-Ross grief cycle following the rape and murder of her teenage daughter. As a few months have gone by without a culprit, Mildred wants to send a message to the local police department, particularly chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). She pays a local advertisement agency for the titular three billboards, which send a direct message to the chief in the form of two questions: \"Raped while dying and still no arrests? How come, Chief Willboughby?\" One could read this as a public lament were it not the attitude and subsequent actions which come from Mildred, who is set on kicking the hornet's nest. McDormand's performance is fierce and vicious, albeit not particularly complex. Her character has the subtlety, complexity, and charm of a middle finger. She was an angry, isolated, bitter person before her daughter died; she adds \"violent\" and \"malicious\" to those traits over the course of the film.\n\nHer counterparts are Willboughby and Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), two good ol' boy Southern police officers. The beloved chief is dying of cancer, hence the controversy behind the billboards. More offended by Mildred than Willboughby is Dixon, a violent, ignorant reprobate who is introduced as having tortured a black man in custody and gotten away with it. \"He's a good cop,\" Willboughby tells an unnamed associate (Zeljko Ivanek), and perhaps this is what McDonagh is aiming for. Even racist, violent police officers are human beings; some can even have pretty Australian wives and get cancer. McDonagh frames these characters with a sense of sympathy-we are meant to empathize with them even as they continue to do morally reprehensible things. A critical choice Willboughby makes midway through the film is portrayed in such a way as to not only excuse it, but perhaps to make it seem laudable or heroic, even redemptive (particularly for Dixon). Later in the film, Dixon throws the billboard advertisement manager Red (Caleb Landry Jones) out a window and beats him bloody in the street. Dixon is not arrested or charged, or even really reprimanded for his actions; indeed, he never addresses, nor shows remorse, nor is held accountable for his violent behavior and racist beliefs. That Rockwell manages to elicit some sense of sympathy for Dixon shows just how wonderful of an actor he is. I'm afraid he'll win an Oscar for his performance here when he's done so much better elsewhere (Moon, The Way Way Back). Same with McDormand and Harrelson; these are fantastic actors whose performances elevate the material enough that it may cause audiences to miss the atrocities this film commits.\n\nIf I'm reading this film correctly, its foundational message is this: racism isn't so big a problem that suicide, vengeful murder, and a few laughs can't solve it. Note how Three Billboards portrays and views people of color, and black people in particular. McDonagh may be attempting to speak to American racial tensions here, but the form in which he does this is entirely through focusing on racist white people not actually come to terms with their prejudice, then using black characters as tools to witness the (false) redemption of his white protagonists. Note also how the film treats women, who are repeatedly battered and abused, often for the sake of attempted humor. Peter Dinklage, a phenomenal actor, seems to be present only so McDonagh can make a few \"midget\" jokes. Finally, note how the film portrays justice and redemption-what does it mean to be good in this world of Three Billboards? Where has it led us with Mildred and Dixon? Do they have character arcs? I suggest they have character spirals, circling further into the depths of human depravity while the film frames them in sympathetic terms. Yet even with this sympathy, McDonagh appears to hate his characters. They're written with broad brush strokes and thin dimensions-like a billboard!-and the \"twists\" audiences may assume are smartly subversive are mere manipulation and tonal whiplash. Tone deaf and abrasive, McDonagh is more like a cat toying with a mouse than a storyteller guiding an audience, gleefully enjoying the cruelty.\n\nAre bigots beyond redemption? If the gospel of Jesus is true (and I believe it is), then the answer is clear: the grace of Christ extends to and is available for anyone and everyone. No one is outside the reach of salvation; all may be redeemed. There are plenty of bigots in the Bible, and there are plenty of well-crafted films about deeply broken people who experience redemption. Three Billboards is not one of those films. It's an anti-redemption film, a cynical tale about how, as one 19-year-old mistress once read off a bookmark, anger begets more anger. What Three Billboards suggests is that we're all bad people; everything is terrible, nothing will get better, so we might as well get a few laughs while we watch it burn. It's a billboard of a film-shallow, artificial, intrusive, and an offensive eyesore to the cultural landscape.",

Even Cornish, Jones, Hedges and especially Dinklage get chances to shine.

I also don\u2019t think any of them are redeemable at the end. The point at the end is not that they are suddenly \u201dgood\u201d, but that maybe they are opening the door to begin the healing process. ",

I could not empathize with the character Lady Bird and while I have not had anything as severe as what happened to the lead character in Three Billboards, I have had some tragedies happen to me.

The story was incredible, the dark humour was hilarious at times and I must highlight the performances of both Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell as they were incredible.

The ability to create sympathy for a racist, spiteful, and angry cop was exceptional.

The film is written and directed by Martin McDonagh and follows Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand), a mother who instals three billboards delivering a bold message to police chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) who after months has failed to catch the culprit who murdered her daughter. The film boasts incredible Oscar-worthy performances from an immensely talented cast and characters that are so well written you wouldn't be wrong to think they are real people. McDonagh executes some of the best character development of the year as everyone has a meaningful arc and a number of layers. The story is riveting from start to finish and paced fantastically, also there is a careful balance of drama, emotion, and humour to where neither one overpowers the rest. It is accompanied by a score helmed by ____________ that perfectly compliments the tone of every scene.\n\nThe writing here from McDonagh is phenomenal, he takes this seemingly simple one-note concept of one woman going up against a police department and takes it in a number of directions you never thought it would go in a very grounded and real way. The unpredictability leads to surprises around every corner and you never know where things are going to end up. The pacing is consistent throughout, never skips a beat or spends too long on one detail. All of the characters are written with a level of depth that that makes each and every person unique and intriguing in their own way. There isn't an under-utilised character in here as everyone has a meaningful story behind them giving them flaws and making them starkly human, grounding them in reality. \n\nThe performances across the board are some of the best of the year, and it's no surprise from an experienced talented cast. Frances McDormand is phenomenal in the lead role and commands the screen the whole time. Her character is the one who establishes the tone of almost every scene and she conveys all of the pain and emotions her character is going through with the subtlest of gestures and facial expressions. But for me the standout here is Sam Rockwell as he puts in a definitive Oscar-worthy performance. He exhibits so much range in his performance that he displays all of the layers of this complex character with ease. Other performances from Woody Harrelson, and Caleb Landry Jones are fantastic and share a tonne of chemistry between the other characters they interact with. \n\nThe movie is thoroughly enjoyable and it only gets more and more entertaining as time goes on. Certain characters grow on you with each passing minute and you begin to get more invested in their lives as you learn more about them. The plot is riveting and there is never a moment of downtime where I wanted things to move on. The comedic moments are perfectly integrated through character interactions and don't feel out of place with the more sombre or somewhat darker dramatic moments. It's a very deep and thought-provoking film that will most definitely be widely featured come the Oscars.\n\n9.2/10",

            "content": "Although Martin McDonagh's last film, Seven Psychopaths, had a fervent fan base I was very disappointed in it; narratively it was all over the place and I found the humour to be extremely forced. With Three Billboards... it's good to see that McDonagh has taken stock and decides to deliver something a bit different this time. Like his brother John Michael did after delivering laughs with The Guard, he followed it up with a more serious tone in Calvary and it was a magnificent change of direction. This doesn't quite hit the same level as his brother's aforementioned film but there's still plenty to admire here.\n\nPlot: Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is an angry, grieving mother who demands justice for the rape and murder of her teenage daughter. But after months have passed and still no arrests, Mildred \nmakes a bold move and has three billboards erected that accuse the local Sherrif (Woody Harrelson) of doing nothing about it. This causes a feud between Mildred and the local law enforcement that only escalates over time. \n\nAs the title suggests, we open on said three billboards which serve as the driving force behind the film's plot developments. Although the message they contain is a striking one, they essentially serve as a self-reflective, moral question that eats away at a number of the small towns inhabitants - none more so than Francis McDormand's mother of the deceased and Woody Harrelson's Police Chief in charge of the investigation.\n\nWhat McDonagh manages to capture here is a fine sense of small town America and how such a tragedy can be so impactful and devastating. This is ultimately the strengths within the film as well as some excellent acting from its three principle leads in McDormand, Harrelson and, the always reliable Sam Rockwell. There's also some fine support in the mould of Caleb Landry Jones, John Hawkes and, the infinitely appealing, Peter Dinklage. To accompany the cast of oddities we have a wonderfully fitting score from Carter Burwell that's reminiscent of his contributions to the works of the Coen brothers. The Coens this ain't, however. McDonagh isn't able to balance his film with the same finesse as the Coens. As he did in his previous films In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths, he includes some offensive racist jokes in one hand while bordering on sexism in the other. As if that's not enough he has Dinklage on the receiving end of one-too-many \"midget\" jibes. If handled with a bit more subtlety then they might have been acceptable but it's the needless repetition of these remarks that make them unpleasant. These were the issues I had with the film as they create tonal shifts that feel uneasy and show that McDonagh is trying too hard to be funny when there's really no need. When he's not concerned with humour, however, McDonagh is actually delivering a solid low-key drama and thankfully that's what takes precedence. Essentially, the film is split into a three act structure \n\nMcDormand hasn't been offered a role this good since her Oscar winning turn in Fargo but, as good as she is, I'm not understanding some of the glowing, five-star reviews the film itself has been receiving - much like I didn't understand the love for Seven Psychopaths. Maybe it's just me but McDonagh really needs to work on his tonal inconsistencies which play havoc on an otherwise great concept. There are contrivances and some plot developments that simply don't work but as a commentary on the state of modern America it's quite astute and while it explores some mature themes, I just can't get past the overriding feeling that McDonagh has yet to grow into a mature filmmaker. This is a good film but it just lacks that cutting-edge spark to make it a great one.\n\nMark Walker",

Unlike that film though, the emphasis here is reversed, with the sporadic humour, used to cushion the impact of what would otherwise be a relentlessly bleak tale.\n\nThe three lead characters, all offer distinctly tragic contributions to the story, yet the magic of McDonagh's writing is in how he dispels any stereotypical character arc - Sam Rockwell in particular manages a journey towards almost redemption by the end, which is not what you would expect, given his crude introduction, and Woody Harrelson's role too is not what you perceive going in. His fate ultimately steers the film in a certain direction, and provides the conflict central to events in the latter parts of the movie.\n\nIt is McDormand's film though - I'm actually one of those who find her a bit of an overrated actress - Fargo in particular was massively overhyped, but here she is masterful. She balances that fine line between psychopathic and sympathetic to perfection. It is a flawless performance, which really is an apt adjective for the film itself. A great start to 2018.",

Also, what the hell did the billboards accomplish? nothing. Yet the narrative is drawn out as this triumph over the system because of Mildred's persistence and forcefulness, yet when they even get a hint of hope in the case it has nothing to do with that, it was pure luck. I just feel like this movie said nothing.\nPeter Dinklage and Caleb Landry Jones were great in their small performances. Sam Rockwell was good too.",

They accuse the Sheriff of doing nothing to catch the killer.  This causes a largely adverse reaction amongst the town's folk , not least one of the sheriff's deputies, the hot-headed, irascible Jason Dixon.\n\nHeaps of potential, much of which is wasted.  The movie is intriguing and entertaining from the outset - the murder mystery, the town dynamic, the interesting array of characters, all presented with dark tongue-in-cheek humour.  Just from the trailer this reminded me of a Coen Brothers movie (not just because it stars Frances McDormand and feels Fargo-esque, or because McDormand is married to Joel Coen) and the initial part of the movies goes some way to reinforce this.  \n\nHowever, writer-director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) never quite matches the effortless slickness, tightness, engagement, focus and story-telling ability of the Coens.  Most tellingly, the plot seems to stumble along, with no clear direction.  Yes, there is the murder mystery, which is intriguing to the very end, but the sub-plots around it seem disjointed.  Moreover, there is little in the way of clear themes.  Even at the end, the messaging is confused and seems to be more a case of McDonagh having a bet each way, rather than making a solid point.\n\nA little bit of focus would have gone a long way.\n\nCan't fault the cast though.  Frances McDormand is excellent as Mildred Hayes, as is Sam Rockwell as Dixon and Woody Harrelson as Sheriff Willoughby.  Good supporting cast which includes some biggish names - Peter Dinklage, Abbie Cornish and Kerry Condon.",

This is dark territory but infused with levity, the viewing experience is not just entertaining but humanistic by the end. McDonagh has proved to be a master in combining violence and humour in absurd situations and making them exciting and real, and after the mis-step that is The Seven Psychopaths, he is back on fine form here with an intriguing and engaging story that takes unexpected turns with nuanced and realistically drawn characters that are played by a terrific cast that also boasts Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell at their best. With a script that takes very unconventional and brave decisions more than once in its narrative plotting, it even finds an ending both appropriate and satisfying for someone like me who generally consider ambiguous ending a cop-out. It probably won't do this film justice to call it the best Coen Brothers film they didn't made, so let's just say McDonagh has managed to channel his inner Coen muse and come up with his best film so far.",

            "content": "THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI-2017(R)-Dec. 24. By:Clem The Movie Guy. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was inspired by one of writer & director Martin McDonagh\u2019s road trips through rural America during which he observed two billboards expressing rage similar to that of main character, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand.) Still grieving over the brutal rape & murder of her teenage daughter, Angela (Kathryn Newton) seven months prior, Mildred Hayes expresses her outrage & frustration toward Police Chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), & rest of the Ebbing police for their failure to determine who was responsible for the horrific crime against her daughter. She rents three abandoned billboards outside of town & issues a challenge. Despite their sympathy toward Mildred, many of the townspeople disapprove of the billboard\u2019s content, particularly since Chief Willoughby is dying from pancreatic cancer. Volatile Officer Dixon & Mildred\u2019s violent ex-husband are particularly incensed by her actions & are drive to take actions of their own. As writer & director, Martin McDonagh has crafted a masterpiece, a film that\u2019s deeply captivating, darkly funny, & compellingly human. Three Billboards also features Peter Dinklage as James, Samara Weaving as Penelope, Caleb Landry Jones as Red Welby, Darrell Britt-Gibson as Jerome & Justified\u2019s Nick Searcy as Father Montgomery. The performances from this stellar cast were TERRIFIC & both Frances MacDormand & Sam Rockwell give the best performances of their careers. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of these films that you may want to see more than once. Three Billboards has been nominated for six Golden Globe Awards including: Best Picture, Best Director & Best Screenplay (Martin McDonagh), Best Actress (Frances McDormand), Best Supporting Actor (Sam Rockwell), & Best Original Score (Carter Burwell). Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is an ABSOLUTE MUST-SEE FILM that will be high on my list of the Best Films of 2017..",

They just threw in a whole bunch of crap and bad humor.  How about some of these unanswered questions:  How does Woody get such a young, attractive wife in the middle of rural Mo?  Who is she and where did she come?  Why does she have a southern/Aussie/S.African/English accent?  Why does she smile as Woody cusses non-stop in front of their two little girls?  Why do they leave the girls alone on a blanket by a lake with an unsolved rape in town?  Why wasn't Officer Dixon arrested for assault or attempted murder?  Why did the replacement chief simply watch the assault happen and not help the injured man or call for an ambulance or arrest Dixon?  How come Frances wasn't arrested or questioned about arson, or for her assault on two high school students?  Why did the dude from Idaho make a scene in the gift shop and talk like an idiot in the bar?  Why did they make it seem like Idaho was right next door to Missouri and you could get there on a nice little road trip?  We should have waited the extra 30 min to see Darkest Hour...",

This movie is that well done.  The movie balances dark humor with tenderness, racism, revenge, and rage, sometimes all in the same scene.\n\nWhat makes this movie especially impressive to me is its unpredictability.  I see a LOT of movies and can usually guess what's going to happen.  Not with this film.  Characters made surprising choices and scenes unfolded in ways I never would have imagined.  For me, that's a delight and why I love movies so much.\n\n                                                           \n\n\nTips for parents: \nTONS of profanity.  Soooo many F-bombs.\nUse of the \"N\" word and lots of other racial slurs.\nDisrespectful talk of homosexuality \nTalk of civil rights\nTalk of rape and abuse\nRobbie talks so disrespectfully to his mom all the time and uses extremely ugly language about her.\nSomeone commits suicide.\nLowest body count (2) in a Martin McDonagh film.\nVery strong, tough female lead. She basically stands up alone for what she believes against an entire town.\nUplifting theme: \nLife, death, and everything in between\nParenting decisions, family\nChoices and consequences\n\"Hate never solved nothing.\" - Woody\n\"Anger begets greater anger.\" - ex husband\nHope\nJustice, revenge\n                                                      \n\nThings I liked:\nFrancis McDormand is amazing as always.  She thought she was too old for the role and initially declined, but her husband said, \"Shut up and do it.\"   \nEntertaining conversations.\nWoody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell are extremely entertaining, as always, and the entire cast knocks it out of the park.\nWhile the movie title suggests that it was filmed in Ebbing, Missouri, the location was actually Sylva, North Caroline, where my mother was born!  I read that the production staff welcomed the locals in Sylva to watch the filming.  After a scene was shot, the actors would sign autographs.  Woody Harrelson gave an impromptu guitar performance.\nPay attention to books people read and TV shows that people watch.  They actually have meaning to what the characters' motivations are.  I love that\nMany of the characters have arc, which is what you want to see in a movie.  There is personal growth and understanding, which gives the film depth and meaning.\nI first noticed Zeljko Ivanek in the popular TV show Madam Secretary: Season 1 and have liked him ever since.\n \n\n\nThings I didn't like:\nI couldn't quite figure out what kind of accent Abbie Cornish was going for.\nThe excessive profanity is tiresome (for me), although appropriate for the film.\nThe ignorant racism towards African Americans and bullying of a gay man is jolting.\n\nFunny lines:\n\n\"I don't know what the compensation scheme is before you throw a guy out a window, Ma. I guess I shoulda looked into that beforehand.  I should Google it.\" - Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell)\n\"Do you think I care about dentists?  Nobody cares about dentists.\" - Sheriff Bill Wiloughby (Woody Harrelson)\n\nInteresting lines:\n\"You aren't trying to get me to believe in reincarnation or something are you, cuz you're pretty, but you ain't her.\" - Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand)",

I get that witty, vulgar dialogue is something this director is known for, but when the subject matter is this dark and there are so many scenes that don't really move the plot along, it kind of loses its punch and starts to feel tiresome. I guess the critics saw something I didn't? Like.. it's not a horrible movie by any means. I like the themes of dealing with anger and how no one is really the \"good guy.\" Now, excuse me, I'm going to walk across the street and throw someone out a window... in broad daylight... across from the police station.

It's racially inappropriate.  The sheriff's wife has a southern accent that turns gaelic for some unexplained reason.  The story line meanders with pointless scene after scene that fail to push the plot forward.  The fact that Rotten Tomatoes has this rated as a 93 i'm assuming out of 100 shows the weakness of this service in its ability to rate the quality of a film.  There are about 20 scenes that will leave you completely dumbfounded on how bad they are like when the sheriff's deputy walks drunk in broad daylight into the second floor of a building and throws a man (the man who rents the billboards) out of a window on to main street in front of the new acting Sheriff with no repercussions.  Just another day in the life of a small town I guess.  One more thing, the film never ends...It goes on and on and on.",

            "content": "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a brilliant film that takes you on a roller coaster of emotions for the entire two hours. I cannot remember the last time I have watched a movie where my opinions on the characters have shifted around so dramatically from one scene to the next. I found myself liking most of the people in the film at some point and disliking those same people at different points. Perhaps that is because the one thing Martin McDonagh pulled off in this film more than any other is making characters that felt like normal flawed humans. This led me on an emotional journey that was delightful. I laughed a lot, I cried a little, and I approached outright anger at one point. This is the kind of thing I wish more movies could accomplish because it takes the medium of film beyond something I passively watch, to become something I connect with on a deeper level. I felt involved in this story because I cared about these characters and was dying to know what would happen to them next. The great thing about Three Billboards is that it doesn\u2019t fall into the easy clich\u00e9s of any genre. It would be simple to boil this all down to a murder mystery and have that become the sole focus, but every moment that you expect one thing to happen, this movie takes you down a road less traveled. I love a good mystery movie, so I\u2019m surprised that this story never bugged me in the way it refused to take the easy way out by becoming more traditional. Frances McDormand is the closest you will get to a protagonist in Three Billboards and she delivers the kind of hard-nosed and strong performance that drives the plot forward, but also makes you question if (or when) she has gone too far. Woody Harrelson is wonderful, in fact this might be my favorite performance he has ever delivered, as the police chief who is trying to juggle dozens of problems at once. Sam Rockwell is perfect as the racist redneck police officer that you love to hate. Every other performance works as well, including Lucas Hedges who I\u2019ve struggled with believing in past film roles. If you asked me to come up with any criticism of Three Billboards it would be difficult if not for one thing. I wasn\u2019t overly fond of a couple speeches in the film. One of them felt out of place in tone and a bit rambling, like it was trying to say something but didn\u2019t have a genuine purpose in the plot. The other was a much better speech but it aggressively highlighted a different scene in the film so felt reverse-engineered to make the plot more simplistic for the audience. (I\u2019m trying to be vague here because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything.) Since the rest of the script was so smart, it was slightly disappointing that it stumbled in these small ways for me. I wonder if, on a second viewing, these moments might prove more satisfying for me, but for now I see them as minor missteps. In every other way I can think of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a nearly perfect film and easily one of the best I\u2019ve seen in 2017. I\u2019ve already recommended it to many people, and I can see myself suggesting it for years to come.",

The crime goes unsolved. She takes it upon herself to rent three billboards to call out the local Sheriff and his deputies for their perceived incompetence. The local townsfolk quickly turn on her and she responds with insults and occasional violence. As the story progresses we see how self-destructive her crusade has become and it is revealed that some of the police are more sympathetic to her plight than she realizes. Three Billboards has been given that Coen-esque label every hack assigns to an off-beat film of this nature, and while it certainly has its moments of dark humor, it's a bit more direct, earnest, and less artistic than Coen Brothers pictures. Frances McDormand is the reason to show up and she gives a bravura outing as a hard-edged mother with a destructive impulse and a vengeful streak without falling into vigilante clich\u00e9s. Every line on her face tells a story and NONE of them are pleasant. Woody Harrelson seems to enjoy himself as the crass local sheriff with a heart of a gold and a terminal illness that threatens his plans. Sam Rockwell plays a deputy controlled by both his mother and an aggressive, violent personality that almost matches the protagonists'. Colorful supporting characters by great actors such as Peter Dinklage help the small town seem like a real, breathing place. Martin McDonagh is no stranger to directing brilliant and underappreciated films such as In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths and his confident hand is seen here, keeping events at a rapid but steady pace. Some may find the ending a bit anti-climactic, but it is in keeping with the tone presented and thematically it works. There are no easy answers for these characters and mostly - there are no answers at all. This is sure to receive awards recognition, so I recommend a quick look if you have the time.",

            "content": "In Bruges is quite simply one of the finest movies ever made, managing the difficult task of being rip roaringly hilarious and gut-wrenchingly emotional at the same time, often in the same scenes. This is Martin McDonagh's signature and he's held it through every one of his films. I admit I wasn't so much a fan of Seven Psychopaths (comparatively), but I think I just need to see it again. Nonetheless it didn't squander my anticipation for his next filmmaking adventure; Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which is getting a hell of a lot of Awards attention, and that couldn't make me happier. Three Billboards is quintessential McDonagh; dark, hilarious, emotional, shocking, quotable, filled to the brim with characters that ooze depth and development. It'll have you laughing and crying at the same moment, on the edge of your seat, and wrapped up in the worlds of each individual character and their own personal story.\n\nThree Billboards follows the tale of Mildred who seeks justice seven months after her daughter's rape and murder. Angry at the local police department's perceived lack of action on the case, she buys out three billboards outside her home to call out the sheriff and make her stand. It splits the town, between those who support her, and those who are angered by her actions, and those who just get caught up in the middle, like her son, and the advertising company who owns the billboards.\n\nMildred is an enthralling character to watch. On the surface she's an extremely unlikeable person. She's brash, angry, foul-mouthed, and lacks any kind of tact. She's so blinded by her own grief and anger that she can't see the effect her actions are taking on those around her, whether those actions are morally or legally right or not. But she is only one of many interesting characters in this movie. Three Billboards only has one, unseen villain; the rapist/murderer, and no heroes to speak of at all. Every character exists in their own spectrum of grey, from Mildred herself, to the angry, racist cop Dixon, to the dying Chief Willoughby, to the unsure of himself, but morally grounded Red. None of them are quintessentially good, and none of them are quintessentially bad; just normal people reacting in sometimes expected and other times unexpected ways, as people do.\n\nI'll skip to the acting now, because that's also such a huge part of these characters. Frances McDormand deserves every accolade she gets over the coming months for her performance as Mildred. In lesser hands Mildred's character could easily have fallen flat, deep in the realms of unsympathetic protagonist, but McDormand takes this woman and makes her so oddly easy to root for. Sam Rockwell is the other standout. I've been singing his praises for years, as he's always the best part of any movie he's in, but as Dixon he's only eclipsed by McDormand. At first a bumbling idiot quick to anger, Rockwell manages to handle the one-eighty with such convincing dignity that it feels natural and real, and that Dixon is still there. He was a smart guy after all, just not very good at communicating. Woody Harrelson is also fantastic as Chief Willoughby, keeping the film firm in it's moral foundations. The supporting cast are all great as well, from Peter Dinklage to John Hawkes to Caleb Landry Jones (who's had a hell of a career so far). The only real weak link is Abbie Cornish who doesn't really know what to do with herself, and whose accent is so bizarrely confusing it's hard to understand where she's meant to be from.\n\nBut the exceptional character work is only a part of what makes Three Billboards so good. Narratively McDonagh manages to craft a story full of unpredictable turns without convoluting itself with twists, and never feels the need to answer anything (including a plot-cliffhanger of an ending). The way Three Billboards manages to balance dark, serious, violent, and shocking, with funny, silly, and even a dash of slapstick is fantastic, and there's so many moments that completely subvert expectations. One example is an interrogation between Mildred and Willoughby as they play off one another, brought to a halt by a sudden cough of blood, and the tone just shifts with the click of the finger. Mildred goes from smarmy smartass to mothering human being without missing a step. Another is a sudden escalation of domestic argument that results in a knife to the throat, but is quickly interrupted by an injection of humour from someone walking in unexpected and apologising.\n\nIn lesser hands these shift of tones would feel haphazard and jarring, but McDonagh somehow manages to keep it all tied together. It doesn't matter that a serious interaction is interrupted by humour (and vice versa), because everything shifts so quickly. For every line that makes you laugh (\"Penelope said begets?\"), there's a line that punches you in the gut (\"I hope you get raped too\"), and it just adds to the unpredictability of the story. There's never a moment that ends exactly the way you think it will.\n\nThree Billboards is definitely a triumph of filmmaking. It's not perfect by any means (Abbie Cornish), but everything it does right, it really does right. Few movies will take you on as much of a rollercoaster as Three Billboards, and fewer still will drive that rollercoaster by characters as deep and interesting as Mildred, Dixon, Willoughby, Red, Robbie, James, and Charlie. The story, the music, the dialogue, the shifts in tone, the acting, the cinematography (that tracking shot, man), it's all fantastic. I give Three Billboards an unquestioning 9/10. What a start to 2018.\n\nhttp://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",

            "content": "My score for; Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is an 6.5 out of 10. Three Billboards is an extremely well acted black comedy of a grieving mother. That would have worked much better as serious drama with comedic moments. Three Billboards revolves around a mother looking for answers for the rape and murder of her daughter. The performance given by Frances McDormand as Mildred the grieving mother is her best since Fargo. I loved the frankness of her character, and how she would let no one push her around. Her character did what so many of wish we could do in life, or do more often, and that\u2019s tell people how we feel about anything. The cast overall is wonderful, and delivered excellent performances. Sam Rockwell stands out though as the town racist police officer. He is a great example of what a person can become by those influences around them, especially their parents. The character is more of a simple man who was never challenged or taught to handle life, and due to circumstances is forced to make some what seem to obvious, but to him hard choices. The journey this town goes on is a funny one. At times it seems as if everyone is an idiot to one degree or another. When the comedy work it really works. There are moments where you feel like should I really laugh at this, but it is played out so well you can help but to laugh. The movie does a good job of taking jabs at issues many have with law enforcement these days, but at the same time showing there is still respect for those who do it the right way. The film is hurt by playing such a serious matter as the rape and murder as a comedy. While I understand the director/writer Martin McDonagh\u2019s intention with the route he took. I feel the gravity of the subject would have worked much better as a drama. The direction of the film made any of the characters at times hard to care for, or have any sympathy for. The direction of Woody Harrelson\u2019s character while ultimately serves the story. I feel could have been handled in a much better way, and probably the film would have ended with a better outcome. The music choices at the opening of the film, and towards the end feels off for the setting, and types of characters we encounter. This is a film that should have earned Frances an Oscar nomination, and it may still will, but the tone of the film ultimately I believe will hurt her chances. Some will feel the ending is hard to process, but I think it is one thing they did get right. I normally not a fan of the type of ending used, but I feel it serves this movie, and it\u2019s characters well on their continuing journey. ",

But a great performance by a great actress and an intriguing premise do not make a great film - not when the lead character is so mean and spiteful that she physically assaults people (adults and juveniles alike) and burns down a police station (nearly murdering a police officer). Rage is not attractive and, while writer-director Martin McDonagh seems to realize this, he doesn't allow McDormand's character Mildred to learn much of anything or reform. In the final scene, she joins forces with a cop (Sam Rockwell) we've been told repeatedly is a racist and drives off to Idaho to possibly kill a military veteran who is definitely a jerk and may be a rapist. There are so many idiocies in the plot it's hard to keep count. First and foremost, the three billboards in question exist on a road that nobody uses much because of the nearby highway and they haven't been rented in more than three decades; yet Mildred waltzes into the modest advertising company that owns the billboards and offers to rent them for a year at a cost of $5,000 a month. (That sum probably would have more than covered the entire year.) And when the billboards are set ablaze, somehow there are back-up panels that can easily be repasted up good as new. (Didn't the wood under the posters burn in the raging fire?) Finally, when Mildred can't come up with $5,000 for month two of the rent, the sum conveniently arrives from an anonymous benefactor, who we learn later was dying police chief Woody Harrelson. (So a small town sheriff, who couldn't make much money, gives away $5,000 as some kind of \"joke\" on a woman who hates him when he knows that he's about to leave behind a full-time-mom wife and two young children?) There are just so many eye-rolling aspects to the plot as it unfolds, or perhaps I should say unravels. Rockwell is excellent as the brutal bumbling deputy, as is Harrelson as the doomed sheriff, but Rockwell's character makes no sense. Is he really racist as described? Is the momma's boy who listens to Abba a repressed homosexual? Is he really not going to face criminal charges for tossing an innocent man out a second-story window in front of numerous witnesses (including his new boss)? Does he actually not blame Mildred for setting the police station on fire and causing him permanent disfigurement? McDonagh, the filmmaker, has a quirky sensibility and that's fine. I'm all for quirky. But the story and the characters need to make sense. And they don't in \"Three Billboards,\" which in the end is just a pretentious movie about a mean-spirited woman that wastes the talents of an excellent cast.",

I am a big fan of writer/direct Martin McDonagh's prior films (\"In Bruges\" makes my top 100 of all time), but this one failed to live up to my expectations. It includes all his signature elements: a quirky tonal mix of humor and drama, sudden and shocking deaths, and a dwarf... but it doesn't all come together like his past films have. McDonagh does dark comedy better than any filmmaker out there, but this one didn't work as well for me because it's not really a comedy, dark or otherwise... it's a drama, and a slow one at that. At its core, it's about how people handle grief and loss in different ways. It does have funny moments, as well as some truly heartrending ones, but it all feels very scattershot. The tone is all over the place and I never quite wrapped my head around what kind of movie I was watching. All the good press this movie is getting has to be due to Frances McDormand's performance, which of course is wonderful and reason enough to see the movie. To be honest, that's not really saying much because she is amazing in everything she does, but this role is really perfect for her. Her character is tough as nails, but she brings an emotion and humanity to this coarse character that could easily be lost with a lesser actress. In addition to McDormand, the movie boasts a fantastic cast (though Peter Dinklage is criminally underused). Unfortunately, the writing isn't very strong, and nearly all the characters are reduced to caricatures of racist hilljacks. Even people in the tiniest, most rednecky town would not behave the way the people in this movie do. There is so much that happens that's so over-the-top, it's downright silly. McDonagh's stories tend to have a surrealist quality, but this is the first one that I thought was just too much. Even if the characters are genuine, you can't have a realistic story if they act in such unrealistic ways, and expect the audience to stay with you. It's a good enough movie, but I just could not get lost in the story, and consequently, I didn't enjoy myself very much. But as a vehicle (and almost certain Oscar win) for McDormand, it's worth watching.",

I was thoroughly entertained and think the actors, story, sub plots, and writing were all very good sans the ending. There were just a few major conflicts, for me, that prevented emotional & comedic continuity to flow evenly through out the film. You walk in knowing her daughter was killed so her behavior/dialogue works as dark comedy. But then you find out she didnt let her daughter have the car because she (the mom) wanted to go out drinking with her friends. The resulting pain & guilt from that decision paints her in a totally different light. Not as a \"bad mom\" but as human being in self inflicted, immense pain. Knowing that, her boorish, brooding behavior isnt funny anymore. Every parent can relate to her, her guilt, and responsibility and cracking jokes aint it. Even \"dark comedy\" has a line and this film suffers from not knowing where it is. To compound that error, it is that same self inflicted pain that cries out for a solution. Redemption. Closure. Justice. But instead we're left with conjecture and her continuing suffering. If any film needed a quasi happy ending.....its this one.",

Om gosh the cast I hope this movie wins best ensemble Frances reminds me so much of ricky bobbys mom, Napolitano dynamite grandma, woody Harrison, Sam Rockwell, Peter Dinklage who's roll is small but impact full. It's a story that revolves around Frances daughter's death. See several months have gone by she see no justice so inorder to keep the investigation going and not for gotten. She orders 3 billboards out side her house. I could go in to more but why this is a movie u should see and enjoy. Very memorable characters the only thing that might piss u off is the ending but if understand what ur watching u know it wasn't about what ur seeing but the resolve that came of it.

Almost every single white was either hateful, obscene, depraved, profane, contemptible, degenerate, brain dead stupid. This film is deliberately anti-Southern rural white and anti-police. With a few brief possible exceptions almost all the whites were unregenerate and beyond redemption.\n\n It fulfills every Hollywood leftist view and stereotype of Southern whites.\nI would have been mad and asked for my money back, but saw it 'free' cuz my Moviepass.com paid for it.\n   The 2 'good guys' were the black replacement Sheriff and the white 'midget'.\n   Could it be that setting it in (Ebbing) Missouri is a deliberate allusion to the FERGUSON, MISSOURI refrain that a Policeman 'deliberately murdered' an unarmed black 'child'? (A lying refrain continuously repeated by our 'divisive' former President Obama?)\n   I have no doubt that (yet another) Hollywood Leftie like Woody Harrelson enjoyed playing the part of the disgusting 'Southern Sheriff'.\nI hated it so much that i'm going to deliberately release some Spoilers:\nThe murder is never close to being solved.  And the only 'suspect' who is overheard 'confessing, bragging' about committing a similar offense of Rape/murder/burning alive turns out to be an American Serviceman who was 'overseas' at the time, in some place 'sandy'. The implication being that he was an American warrior bragging about committing a similar atrocity (which is the familiar accusation of the Left and enemies like ISIS).\n    And the movie is riddled with over-the-top unbelievable actions and dialog that are beyond belief that any sane persons would act or talk this way.\n  This movie should do well as propaganda overseas in places where anti-American bigots and enemies run most rampant.\n  I'm giving it a 1/2 star out of 5 possible on my RottenTom scale, but only because it is not possible to give it a lower, or negative score.\nI would polish this 'review' but this movie isn't worth the effort.",

            "content": "With 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths', writer/director Martin McDonagh proved himself a master of poignant black comedies, the kind that generate laugh-out-loud moments from the darkest of situations without sacrificing the integrity of his characters. That precarious balancing act is on full display in his latest project, which charts a grieving mother's aggressive attempts to make the local police solve her late daughter's murder. Frances McDormand gives a volcanic performance in the lead role that's worth the price of admission alone - whether she's quietly simmering or allowing her righteous indignation to erupt in flames, she's a force of nature that refuses to me ignored, making her few moments of vulnerability all the more devastating to behold. Rising to McDormand's challenge are Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell, both outstanding as smalltown cops who find themselves directly in McDormand's crosshairs. As the scope of the story widens and we meet other Ebbing locals (played by the likes of Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes and Lucas Hedges), McDonagh reminds both us and his characters the importance of empathy and how recognizing other people's pains doesn't negate our own. This otherwise stellar film is not without its faults: tasked with keeping so many plates spinning at once, the movie shortchanges a couple of its characters' personal journeys. [Also, in both 'In Bruges' and here, McDonagh seems uncomfortably fond of making little people the butt of his characters' jokes...what's that about?] Those quibbles aside, THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI is a gripping comedy-drama that finds much-needed humour in its fiery tale of grief and redemption.",

            "content": "Going into Three Billboards I had high hopes. An intriguing trailer, a high score here on RT and a cast of outstanding actors (seriously, who doesn't love Frances McDormand?), what could go wrong? Quickly, I realized exactly what could go wrong for this movie... THE SCREENPLAY. This movie was so bad, it prompted me to make an account here on Rotten Tomatoes so that I could give it the review it deserves. Without further ado:\n\nThe flaming turd that is the script for Three Billboards demonstrates scene after scene just how desperate writer/director Martin McDonagh is to wring some \"comedy\" out of his completely unbelievable characters. He loses all credibility (or what little he had left after Seven Psychopaths) by shoehorning in scenes that would never happen given the characters he has \"crafted\". Furthermore, it is made apparent that McDonagh has most likely never stepped foot outside a major city and has no idea what middle America is like. Case in point: the catholic priest.  This is the first red flag showing that the writer knows nothing of his subject matter. Early in the film, Mildred (McDormand) comes home to find her son (played by an under-utilized Lucas Hedges) confiding with a catholic priest. The problem: Everyone knows that Missouri is firmly situated in the Bible Belt. Anyone who knows anything about Christianity, knows that most American Christians are not Catholic. That rings especially true in small towns in the Bible Belt (aka Baptist Country). Missouri is one of the least Catholic states in the country. What little Catholics they do have are in the city, not out in rural small towns. The only reason McDonagh places a catholic priest in his screenplay is so that he can shoehorn in an anti-Catholic rant for Mildred to introduce how badass she is and how many f*cks she gives (zero).\n\nOk, a priest where a preist would never be, I can look past that. But then Mildred's ex-husband is introduced and we are forced to suspend even more reality. Remember how McDonagh firmly established Mildred as a badass chick who is willing to do anything (including burning down a police station) to fight the power? Would you believe that this woman who doesn't take shit from anyone just got out of a decades long marriage to a man who beat her and made her life a living hell? A marriage where no single shred of evidence exists that there was ever even an ounce of love between them? No? Neither would I. The family that McDonagh has created could never exist as it does in this film. It would have broken up many years ago. The children would have moved away long before they turned 18 and the father would have been out of the picture long before that. But no, McDonagh forces us to watch this family coexist in one room. A room where everyone gets called a c*nt and somehow the greasy, woman beating father/ex-husband has a hot 19-year-old seemingly normal girlfriend. Yeah right. It's these unbelievable scenes that take the viewer out of the movie, pulls back the curtain to reveal the writer's obvious intentions.\n\nSo, if you're keeping score, McDonagh is desparate to disparage catholics, fathers, and what's next? The police. You thought the family dynamic was unbelievable, wait until you see McDonagh's police force. Sam Rockwell plays the most moronic police officer ever put to film (don't worry Sam, I know it's not your fault) easily surpassing The Simpsons' Chief Wiggum with none of the lightheartedness. Rockwell's Dixon is literally too stupid to function, let alone be employed by a real-world police force or employed anywhere for that matter. At one point he throws a man out of a two-story window in broad daylight with dozens of witnesses including police and there's pretty much zero consequences. In the real world he'd be arrested and sued on the spot, but not in McDonagh's world where police are special-ed drop outs who live with their mother. Mcdonagh couldn't make it any more obvious. Subtlety? Nah, McDonagh despises police in America so much he doesn't care how obvious it is. \n\nAnd then comes Woody Harrelson to save the movie, right? Wrong. His character is ruined by McDonagh as well. Harrelson's Sheriff Willoughby is clearly supposed to be the saving grace of the police force, but for some reason he has faith in the utterly incompetent Dixon and the other forgettable incompetent policeman which drives the problems with McDonagh's police force in the first place. In addition to that, Willoughby is for some reason married to an attractive Australian (who also happens to be the weak link in the chain of good actors) who is half his age. Because, you know, bald, 55-year-old, middle of nowhere sheriffs can get any girl they want. I don't know what would be harder to find: a catholic congregation in a small town in Missouri or an Australian who for some reason permanently resides in Missouri. I'm gonna give the benefit of the doubt to the casting director and assume that it was McDonagh's idea to cast an Australian who can't act in a middle America role and for some reason keep her accent.\n\nFinally comes the climax. Just when you think McDonagh has given us a glimmer of hope of seeing some justice for Mildred and her late daughter, he decides: nah. A character is introduced that fits completely with who Mildred's daughter's killer should be, he even brags about committing the EXACT same crime. But then McDonagh decides, for no reason, it's just a coincidence. And by the way, the sicko is a veteran too. McDonagh shit score: Catholics, fathers, police, veterans.\n\nThe Icing on the cake though, to drive it all home that McDonagh hasn't a clue of what he's talking about: the Idaho license plate. The sicko introduced in the third act is from Idaho. He drives to Missouri, pops in and out of Missouri every now and then. Mildred and Dixon decide they're gonna go murder him over in IDAHO. They're gonna take a nice afternoon DRIVE TO IDAHO. FROM MISSOURI. Clearly McDonagh never took American geography. Clearly McDonagh was thinking of Iowa, a state that shares a boarder with Missouri. Not Idaho, a state that is a THREE-DAY DRIVE away from Missouri. Mildred and Dixon, in the middle of the afternoon, on a whim, as if they were driving to the next town over, decide to go on a (at minimum) week-long road trip together. Very believable. I'm in awe of this world you've created McDonagh.\n\nAnd this movie is getting good reviews. FACEPALM",

            "content": "It isn't very often that you see a movie like Three Billboards Outside Ebbings, Missouri. Defying easy description, it treads a fine line between tragedy and the blackest of humor to tell a richly nuanced tale of mourning, vendettas, forgiveness, and small-town insanity.\n\nMost of the insanity comes from hard bitten single mother Mildred Hayes, who rents out the titular billboards to demand why the police haven't solved the rape and murder of her teenage daughter months after it occurred. This doesn't sit well with the local PD, or with the many townspeople who adore the long serving, easygoing Chief Willoughby. The tensions this generates drives the story, along with many ill thought out hijinks.\n\nOur humble protagonist is not the most likeable of people. She's cynical, foul mouthed, possessed of an acidic wit, and not particularly concerned what anyone thinks of her. She's also never been the kind of woman to let decency, common, sense, or the law stop her from doing anything, which she demonstrates repeatedly. Yet on some level this is what makes her relatable. She's may be a complete B, but not an unfeeling one. And she has a very good reason for her pain and anger.\n\nWhen her anger fades and her dark wit fails her, we see that she is a woman deeply in mourning, with only the barest hope of closure. Particularly heartrending are the flashbacks to the bitter fights with her daughter, when she was still alive. It's amazing that she's able to carry on under the weight of such sorrow and guilt. She certainly hasn't chosen the healthiest outlets for her grief, but I suppose we all have our ways of coping. Frances McDormand's performance as Mildred is utterly brilliant, and I hope she takes all the awards she's been nominated for.\n\nSam Rockwell is likewise a real firecracker as the drunken, brutally violent Officer Dixon, who is the closest thing this movie has to an antagonist. He is truly a sight to behold when he gets all riled up, his fists flying as he cusses up a storm. It's hard to believe that he hasn't ended up in his own jail long ago. But as with most people in this movie there may be more to him than first impressions would suggest.\n\nWoody Harrelson provides a sharp counterpoint to McDormand's acid wit and Rockwell's explosive violence as Chief Willoughby.  Friendly and easy going even in tough times, his infectiously good-natured charm permeates the film long after his character has made his exit. His letters to Mildred and the other key players are filled with wisdom and humor, made funnier by the circumstances in which some of them are read. And oddly enough, they do more than anything else to drive personal growth and change in their recipients. It might even be enough to put Mildred on a slightly brighter path, though I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that frequently makes you laugh, then makes you feel bad for laughing. It's a testament to the director and writer's brilliance that the movie can find humor in material this bleak. Or it might say something about their mental state. Three Billboards is also the kind of movie that constantly subverts your expectations. Every time you think you know where the plot is going it suddenly reverses on you. Characters develop in ways you never would have imagined. The best bits of humor- and the deepest bits of pathos- frequently come without warning. And the ending is a stroke of genius. It's nothing you'd expect, but it's the perfect one for this movie.",

Throughout Martin McDonaugh's 2017 black \"comedy\", Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, said realization began to creep in like an unwanted guest not too far into this tale about a small town mother (Frances McDormand is good with the limited material she is given) seeking justice for the unsolved murder of her daughter. Since the 2008 release of In Bruges, McDonagh has been praised for his unique voice and style but before, with his tales of gangsters and hitmen (he retreaded similar character types with 2012s Seven Psychopaths), the writing and direction fit perfectly like a bullet in a gun chamber but with his newest feature it's all blanks that are being shot. Tonally inconsistent-never comfortable with the balance between drama and jokes-a lack of rhythm is one of the films first obstacles to overcome, never really finding any footing until very (third act) late into proceedings where things finally seem to flow but by then it's too little, too late. Sam Rockwell gives a nice performance (town idiot that borders on parody most of the time) but even then due to the schizophrenic nature of the inconsistent tone it all feels like that-a performance-that is being put on display with no natural investment. He epitomizes the film in many ways as the experience is all show so when the story gets to the meaty drama it feels like pure manipulation. This jarring nature of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is bound to find enthusiasts but you'd better be off sticking with McDonagh's far superior previous features.",

Revenge and vengeance is something many people have to have, even before justice, and that is what this movie is all about at the core of it.  To get there, this movie goes through some messed up stuff.  There are almost too many statements that the film is trying to make.  I mean there's race relations, homosexuality, poverty, sex, police control and a few others and some just simply don't have any resolution.  Thank goodness there is a good amount of  humor in this thing, or you would be leaving the theater feeling all kinds of depressed.  I've always enjoyed films that take a chance and go for something more then a neat and tidy ending, and this film certainly does that.  It's so well acted, even if some of the casting choices are a bit strange.  The strength of the movie comes with this great cast, and it is a very good reason to go see this thing.

Instead, we get little doses of criticism and commentary here and there, but with a larger spotlight shown on the complicated, non-binary mechanisms of human morality and behavior that operate in and around these facets of discussion.

Forgive the sloppy styling, grammatical errors and general upheaval of my writing. While I do try and write something cohesive and obeying film review etiquette, mostly, I say fuck that. What I love about theater going, is going is the surge of emotions I experience, especially during a particularly bad or a truly great film. I try (and likely fail) to translate that feeling into my writing but hey, I warned you. You can stop now and I'll never know.\n \nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\nWatched 12/8/2017\n \nI absolutely love Martin McDonagh, his films in Bruges and Seven Psychopaths are some of the most clever, shocking, human and hilarious films I've had the pleasure of viewing. I've been waiting years for his newest, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\n \nIt didn't disappoint.\n \nAt its base level, the story is straight forward enough. A young girl was raped and murdered, her corpse mutilated. A viciously heinous crime that tore a small town a part. A year later the case is closed and not one suspect is apprehended. What I thought would be a typical \"whodunnit?\" it morphed into one of the most intense and emotional films I've seen. I knew McDonagh could deal with controversial subjects, but I am not certain I was fully prepared for the film to follow.\n \nI should've known better than to put McDonagh in a box, I knew he would surprise me especially with the power house cast working with him. Woody Harrelson plays the small-town sheriff, while you may already have a preconceived notion of what a Harrelson sheriff would look like, I think this is Harrelson's best performance in years. He represents a force we do not agree with but does it with an edge, humanity, and humor that makes it feel real. One of the most gut-wrenching parts of the film is we are supposed to hate him, but he is written and performed so well, that we feel for him perhaps more than anyone else in the film. Sam Rockwell plays abhorrent, racist, violent cop Dixon. I've seen Rockwell in an unlikeable role before, but he always has a certain charm about him...In Three Billboards, he is an absolute tyrant. It's difficult to watch his scenes.\n \nAnd then we have Francis McDormand. Her portrayal of Mildred, the murdered girls mother is incredible. She is fearless and smart and relentless in her quest for answers. She takes no prisoners stopping at nothing to get some semblance of justice she feels so entitled to. It's only then she witnesses the injustices going on right before her.\n \nSimpler minded folk, may think this is when the film gets on a moral high horse, or is stereotypically holding a mirror up to society. But those are simpler minded folk. This is a film of the 21st century, mainly the past few years. It creatively challenges and audience and slips in messages of hope and change with its subject matter in which you'll likely be offended.\n \nThe language and slurs used will have backlash for McDonagh and crew. We just live in that age, that even if you're a proponent for diversity and change, a proponent for civil rights, even if the message is positive, there are certain words that will immediately have a percentage your audience close their brains and just propel hate and ignorance for a project. We live in a very sensitive time, and this film will push your buttons. The language and actions that take place are not done in an exploitative manner and I think that's all the difference, the words are very much a product of real characters, not simply delivered for shock value, but delivered with a purpose. I applaud the bravery and risks being taken with this film and I am glad McDonagh and McDormand, and Harrelson and especially Sam Rockwell have the guts to stand behind their work and refuse to apologize. You need to see this film.\n \nIt so much more than just a revenge story. It gives us hope that people, even the worst people, can change and be touched. That hatred isn't natural but a product of an unnatural, unhealthy environment. Three Billboards not only flooring emotionally but also witty and funny. The beautiful balance of comedic and dramatic tones is everything I wanted and more from McDonagh. It takes a talented person who can add humor to a script like this and it breaks up the tension so well. The actors knock it out of the park. McDonagh is one of the best story tellers working today I can't wait to see what is in store for us with his next project. But I think I'll watch this a few more times while I wait.",

It begins assertively with McDormand looking and acting tough.  ranges through a roll call of controversy- policing, discrimination, rape, violence, suicide, free  speech, institutions.  At times it strikes false notes, as when the Dinklage character is the subject of too many jokes at his own expense; or when ageing small-town males are paired with improbably young and glamorous women. The Harrelson character is yet another in the well-trodden formula of older white male spirit guide. Most of the roles including McDormand's character soften as the show goes on: ok these other shows weren't comedies, but compare the unshakenly-written roles of Fonda in Georgia Rule, Hunter in Strange Weather, Redgrave's n Secret Scripture, or Huppert's in Valley of Love, all concerning older mothers dealing with great loss. This screenplay smooths everything down eventually. The soft-centre approach weakens the depth of the black comedy, and the power of the comment.  That makes it easier as a conversation piece. But unlike the great classics of social criticism through comedy, in the final result this show does not thoroughly mean it.",

These descriptions can also apply to Mildred (deftly played by Frances McDormand), a woman bent on uncovering the truth in a horrible tragedy that claimed the life of her (she got it honestly) angry daughter. To be frank, this film doesn't forge through its material with a PC touch and it goes for the raw, offensive nerve in just about every situation. This is actually one of the film's strengths, as it posits a volatile town where there are still tensions (a fleeting reflection of true Americana in its current political climate). The police are portrayed as bumbling, bad men (all white) until their onion is peeled back to reveal layers of complexity, even with some of the more rotten badge-holders (Rockwell in particular, turning in a delightfully offensive performance). It is chief Willoghby (an amazing Harrelson) that actually lends the local police its strong, moral backbone. It is clear that he sees the good in his patrolmen, which is why some of them are still employed. He also is nearing the end of his life which also suggests that he just doesn't really care to bother with new hires considering how much time he has left. And yet, when the Billboards go up, he is the least offended even though he is singled out. They spark an interest in taking another look. Meanwhile, the billboards spark all sorts of ugliness for most of the other characters. \nA final thought, and hopefully I can leave it without spoilers. The billboards, while blatantly targeting the police, may also serve another purpose for Mildred. A sense of redemption by way of the heat she receives for putting them up in the first place, perhaps the billboards are also a way to help her overcome her own grief and guilt in her daughter's gruesome demise. It's worth the viewing to see the complexities of guilt at multiple levels amongst multiple characters, and the varying ways these characters confront it.",

It seems the camera only pulls back long enough to show the space where they're about to wreck some physical or emotional havoc.  All the characters are great and complex while their actions and attitudes change from good, bad, or really, really, grey.  The three billboards put up in the beginning appear to provide the catalyst for the shakeup, overshadowing every character in bold black and red.  While everyone blames Hayes for shaking up the community with her billboards, they lose sight of what she's trying to communicate, that her daughter's death shook up the community but couldn't be solved, and everyone is trying to bury the memory for lack of success.  Hayes refuses to let the memory be buried, and the town reacts in different ways.  Pacing is great, and no scenes are wasted.  \nIf this film has faults, it struggles composing solid nature exposition shots to really set the mood and put the characters in a place of receding misery.  With even a scene dedicated to the deceased victim, this film is an excellent character drama.",

Ebbing is a small town where everyone knows each others' business. It's no secret that it was Mildred who put them up, and now she is under fire for her brazen attempts to be heard. Not even the local priest is happy with her. She has zero time for anyone that doesn't want to help her. Adding fuel to the fire is Officer Dixon (Rockwell), the quintessential racist cop who believes he runs the town. All Mildred wants is to have closure, yet that's hard to come by in a town full of secrets, selfishness, and intolerance.\n\nIrish playwright Martin McDonagh won audiences over with films like In Bruges (2008) and Seven Psychopaths (2012). He writes a wickedly dark sense of humor into his scripts, and that is very present in Three Billboards. It's the kind of snappy, and sometimes vulgar, comedy that may turn certain audiences off. It always feels appropriate for his characters garnering that cringe-worthy shaking of the head at the same time. Much like the Coen Brothers, his characters are offbeat but always grounded in reality. They're gems for any actor to play as they're wholly original and McDonagh gives the actor everything they need in the script. He's assembled an exceptional cast of some of the best character actors working together who are able to ride the line of making them unhinged, yet never turning to caricature.\n\nFrances McDormand gives a staggering, Oscar-worthy performance as Mildred. She is captivating from start to finish. She can stare down any character leading you to question just how far she will go like any mother or father would in her situation. She effortlessly nails every zinger McDonagh throws her way when Mildred refuses to back down. During one scene, she is startled by the presence of the priest in her home. It ends with a topical monologue about the idea that if you're a member of some group, you are culpable regardless of your innocence. There was an actual mid-movie applause by the audience as she takes down the priest. She goes toe to toe with Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell who both appeared in McDonagh's Seven Psychopaths. Woody Harrelson brings out the conflicted side out of Willoughby, as he understands Mildred's message but doesn't always agree on her methods. Rockwell gives one of the best performances of his career as racist cop Dixon. It is a treat to see him soar with such an uncomfortable character. Watching McDormand and Rockwell spar is a master class in acting. He rightly deserves award consideration for his performance going up against her. Joining them are Oscar nominees John Hawkes (Winter's Bone) and Lucas Hedges (Manchester by the Sea) as her ex-husband and son, respectively. Peter Dinklage also shines by playing the polar opposite of his Game of Thrones character.\n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is less about trying to solve the case of who raped and murdered Mildred's daughter, but more of an examination of how a small town reacts when it's shoved in their face again. It's easier to sweep it under the rug claiming they tried when they didn't really fight for her. It's an eye-opening look into the role hate and power can play in a community. How often do we hear about characters like Dixon who let the power that comes with being a cop overtake them? Add into that someone fueled with hate toward a different race and they're a ticking time bomb. Power is also played out when Mildred faces someone who could be her daughter's rapist. He's a violent man who knows who she is and completely uses his power on her in an attempt to scare her. We don't know if he's guilty or not of that crime, but he's sick enough to use it to his advantage.\n\nMartin McDonagh has written a compelling and original script oftentimes taking the audience in a different direction than expected. You'll probably find yourself laughing more than expected given the material, but that's the McDonagh way. Every one of his actors gives a top-notch performance, and I expect McDormand and Rockwell to be among those talked about around Oscar time.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Frances McDormand is always worth a trip to the movies.\n\nRATING: 4.5 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

I loved In Burges, but this is Martin McDonagh best directing and screenwriting (but I have to admit that this is so Coen like in tone and dialog that it would not surprise me if some of it was not \"helped\" by one (or both) bothers)...but either way the screenplay will get the an oscar nod (and likely win) as well.

As soon as I heard Martin McDonagh was directing a new murder mystery set in the south, I knew it was going to be that type of film. McDonagh is known to be a playwright first and a film director second, but you would never know that if you saw his movies. In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths were both refreshing and entertaining fun, and a served as a great directorial debut. His solid track record and, of course, the reviews were the reasons I was so confident in the third entry of McDonagh's filmography: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Frances McDormand plays a grieving mother named Mildred who's daughter was brutally murdered six months prior to the beginning of the film. The local police have been unsuccessful in finding her daughter's killer so Mildred publicly addresses the issue by putting up a large message divided between on the outskirts of town. The message is brutally raw, and it's directed at the sheriff, Bill Willoughby (played by Woody Harrelson). McDonagh is clearly well-versed in writing because the pacing, dialogue, plot, and characters are impeccable. There is no clear villain because there are always two sides to every story, and McDonagh takes this concept into account by providing us with several three-dimensional characters. As this amazing story is unfolding, you'll discover the added bonus of killer performances from Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell, all of which deserve Oscar-nominations at least. Three Billboards brings to mind the most primitive form of storytelling genres, created over two millennia ago: comedy and drama. McDonagh has mastered the concept of genre by fusing the two into one glorious package. At face value, it's about grieving through the will for revenge. By the time the credits roll, you'll realize it's actually about grieving and finding a way to move on. This is essential viewing for anyone looking to laugh, cry, or be witness to one of the most meaningful movies of the year.",

            "content": "I honestly thought Three Billboards was a Coen Brothers movie. It's a quirky dark comedy starring Frances McDormand, the lead of Fargo and Blood Simple. Three Billboards, however, is a movie by Martin McDonagh, the Irish director behind In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths, yet it manages to be better at being a Coen Brothers movie than the actual Coen Brothers movie this year, Suburbicon.\n\nThree Billboards is a biting and often bittersweet social commentary on criminal justice in America, specifically the rural south. Each of its characters fills the archetypes you'd expect, but each one of them carries hidden pains that makes the movie personal. All of the actors turn in standout performances, with the exception of Abbie Cornish, who has odd traces of her Australian accent despite pulling off a perfect American accent in Geostorm, of all movies. Complementing the captivating performances is an equally captivating cinematography. A one-shot of Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths) builds up heart-pounding momentum to his erratic behavior. However, there are moments where the editing makes it falter. An equally suspenseful moment with Rockwell later on loses its momentum when the scene is repeatedly interrupted by cross-cutting.\n\nIt shouldn't be hard to understand what the script and the acting are trying to convey. This is a very straightforward and literal-minded movie. There is very little subtext to the dialogue. Its structure, themes, and references all bear the hallmarks of theater, rather than film. That's not necessarily a problem. After all, Martin McDonagh is a playwright, and he uses that experience to bring a literary style to cinema. However, it runs the risk of becoming to easy to follow. About a third of the way through, I was afraid of being left unimpressed.\n\nThen, the movie arrives at an unexpected turning point. It ends up subverting not just your expectations, but also the conclusions you formed about the movie over its first half. This subversion challenges the audience and even makes the narrative uncomfortable. You're forced to reexamine everything you thought you knew about the movie. You may even end up changing your mind about certain things. Theses hidden layers of complexity are what makes Three Billboards one of the more memorable movies of 2017. It deserved to have the weekend all to itself.",

The first, which could overlook if it weren't for the second, is that the characters do, or don't stuff, that don't make any sense. For example, when Dixon throws Red out of a second story floor, in uniform, across the street from the police station, he simply walks back into the station. Even if the cops didn't want to arrest him there were witnesses everywhere-who also, by the way, did nothing. When a creepy guy walks into Mildred's store and all but admits to the rape, she lets him walk out when they get interrupted. Doesn't run out and get the license plate number, doesn't call the cops. If Dixon wanted the suspect's DNA, why not simply wait for him to leave and grab his empty beer bottle? How can you repost on a billboard that's just been burnt down? How can the police station still be used after its burned? Stuff like that. But the worse is the ending. Totally ruined the movie for me. I get that its an indy and the writer wants to be edgy and not do a typical Hollywood ending but anything is better than what we get. Not only does it not make sense, its almost as if there's another 10 minutes that they just lopped off. Very disappointing.",

            "content": "In the first scene of writer/director Martin McDonagh's (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) new film, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Pierce (Frances McDormand) drives past three billboards that are falling apart on an old road outside the titular small town she lives in that no one has used since the freeway opened. Hell, the last time a company even utilized the billboards for actual advertising was Huggies in the mid-eighties. Due to the contemplative look on Mildred's face we know the inciting incident is set to occur at any moment, but more important is the fact we take in the appearance of Mildred. Her hair is down, her clothes rather casual, and while Mildred never seems like she was ever the kid of woman to get too made-up, she looks to be in a certain place in her life that, while not peaceful, is one where she's come to terms with the reality of her situation. You see, Mildred's daughter was murdered a year or so prior to the beginning of the film and the investigation by her local police department seems to have waned over time-Mildred stating she hadn't heard a peep from them in at least seven months-prompting her to take matters into her own hands, but not in the manner of a revenge fantasy a la The Punisher or a recent Quentin Tarantino flick, but more in the vein of calling out those responsible for seeking her daughter's killer and rapist and holding them accountable for failing at their civil responsibilities. If you've seen the trailers you know Mildred does this by renting the three aforementioned billboards to send a very clear message to the Ebbing police department, calling out Police Chief George Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) in particular. Once Mildred goes through with this though, her look changes and, in turn, so must her mentality. No more does Mildred ever look as casual as she does in that first scene. No more does it feel as if Mildred might ever be at peace with what has occurred in her life. Rather, from the end of this scene on through to the end of the movie Mildred pulls her hair up into a tight ponytail, the back of her neck now shaved as if to say she has no frills about what she's doing. Never again do we see her in public with her hair down or her wearing anything resembling khaki or flannel, but rather Mildred only wears her industrial work uniform and bandana. This outward exterior that takes no crap from no one is key to her surviving the ramifications that come from her actions and the complexities she didn't expect as a result of those actions. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri takes on this exterior as well, but don't be fooled as this is one of the most brutal, funny, dark, sad, and best movies of the year.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

Never heard of any family use C word towards one another nor wish their own daughter raped. Being nit picky but the locations looked nothing like Missouri. Save your time and money.

If nothing else, viewers are treated to a phenomenal performance from Frances McDormand. While she may play another riff on the tried-and-true \"rigid person hiding an unexposed warmer interior,\" the audience's heart goes out to her when she does allow those psychological/societal blocks to yield. As for the other main names in the ensemble, Sam Rockwell can provide some good laughs in certain roles, but even as the part he played grew on me, I don't think it was as revolutionary as it is being made out to be during awards season. On the other side, I was far more pleased to see Woody Harrelson as his character. Although his part is minimal, he makes a good impact as the sheriff in the flick. I did appreciate, as well, how the film does not force the viewer to pick a side in who is right in the main conflict in the movie; one could feel equally bad for both parties in the situation of an unresolved case of murder and rape. In summary, while it was not my cup of tea, the flick was certainly powerful and still worth seeing, though.",

To me, the best part of the film is it's unpredictability. As a person who sees over 100 films a year, i am generally able to predict what is about to happen. I did not see a single thing in this movie coming (except one thing). It has an incredible cast including Frances McDormand who plays a woman who has lost her daughter and is always able to come up with a joke on the spot, and Sam Rockwell, playing a dipshit racist mama's-boy cop. Another thing that I liked about this film is that everybody has their flaws. Even Frances McDormand's character has her bad qualities. Sam Rockwell, the racist cop, even has his good qualities. This film acknowledges the fact that everyone has their good and bad qualities making the characters feel more human. The film overall is sad, but the last 20 minutes of the movie are especially heartbreaking. I am not going to say what happens because I want people to go see this movie for themselves because I cannot think of a single thing that I did not like about this movie. \"Three Billboards\" is the second best film I have seen this year and definitely deserves 5 stars.",

Mildred (Frances McDormand) buys three billboards close to her home to ask Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) why haven't they found her daughters killer. Mildred's signs soon get some attention when the news reports on it. Not everyone likes the signs especially another policeman named Dixon (Sam Rockwell). Even Mildred's son Robbie (Lucas Hedges) doesn't entirely agree with everything going on. Soon enough the police keep putting pressure on Mildred by doing just about everything to screw her over on the signs. I enjoyed the film. At times it's a dark comedy, but it's largely a drama. It goes a lot into what someone will do especially ina  time when they are very guilty about what happened. McDormand is really good here as Mildred. She's a \"don't give a F**k\"attitude and says everything that's pretty much on her mind. You learn more about her throughout the film and you really do just feel for her. I especially liked the performances by Harrelson and Rockwell as well. Harrelson has a really tragic story to his character and although you're rooting for Mildred to find out who the killer is you know the Sheriff is doing everything he can do. Rockwell as Dixon too is a tough one. He's not very smart and kinda  an asshole, but you see the reasoning behind it all. He's longing to fit in even though he's a kid at heart still. Overall, this film has a great plot and although it doesn't quite answer every single thing by the end of it it has a message about how life is and how you kind of have to keep hope alive. I enjoyed this one a lot and highly recommend giving this one a look!",

            "content": "November 24, 2017\n\nIt's been seven months since Mildred Hayes' daughter was raped and burned to death, and one day, while driving down a remote country road just outside Ebbing, Missouri, she gets an idea: use the three billboards on this quiet, secluded route, which haven't been rented since 1986, to call out the Ebbing police department and ask why they aren't doing their jobs, because her daughter's killer still roams free. Mildred (Frances McDormand) gets the ball rolling almost immediately when she storms into the Ebbing Advertising office, with $5,000 in hand, and emphatically tells the young pipsqueak manager, Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones), she wants to buy time on the billboards and here's what they should read: \"Raped while dying\"; \"And still no arrests\"; and \"How come, Chief Willoughby?\".\n\nOf course, Mildred's little stunt cause an uproar with the police department and the other locals who support them. But in a town like Ebbing, there isn't much to lose, especially for a woman like Mildred, who's already lost so much. She's a bitter divorcee and a single mom to Robbie (Lucas Hedges); works a dead-end job at the local gift shop; and lives with the added humiliation of knowing her abusive ex-husband (John Hawkes) is now dating a 19-year-old. Her grief for her daughter has morphed into anger and resentment, and she wants justice already, or at least a better pursuit and investigation toward it. In a town where she thinks the police officers have nothing better to do than harass black people or prop their feet up on their desks, she thinks it's high time they get their priorities in order.\n\nTwo of the officers Mildred specifically targets are Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his second-in-command, Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), the former because he's the head of the department and should be a more capable leader, and the latter because he's a known drunk and racist. Willoughby, a family man and respected member of the community, tells her there was no DNA evidence to make an arrest for her daughter's rape and murder, and pleads with Mildred to take the posters down. But it goes to show just how relentless Mildred is when she pays Willoughby no attention and instead suggests he make a database cataloguing the DNA of every male over the age of eight living in Ebbing (despite the civil rights violation) and start looking for matches. Clearly, Mildred has thought this through, and she's not about to back down. \n\nThe slow-witted, mamma's boy Dixon, meanwhile, thinks the police have the authority to take the posters taken down themselves since it's defamation of character, but one of the desk sergeants (Zeljko Ivanek) points out, \"It's not defamation because she's asking a question.\" Whether Mildred's question finds an answer, leads to an arrest, or just causes her more grief remains to be seen, but it certainly shakes up the town.\n\nAll this sets the stage for Martin McDonagh's peculiar and offbeat \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" which is technically a drama but also has moderate doses of comedy and violence. This is the type of off-kilter story McDonagh (\"In Bruges\", \"Seven Psychopaths\") is used to telling, and his earlier works proved the filmmaker's varying tones could make for stirring and rousing cinema, but with \"Three Billboards,\" he seems to have diluted his ambitions somewhat because the film often succumbs to incredulous contrivances just to get a rise out of us. As attention-holding as it is, thanks mostly to the strong performances, there's something off, perhaps even fraudulent, about the way the story plays out, and some of the events within McDonagh's screenplay are so far out there and unbelievable, the film as a whole isn't able to render the harrowing emotional or intellectual impact it wants. \n\nI think one of the issues is that we're never quite sure whether we're supposed to take the film as reality or as some kind of fantasy in which Mildred is the underdog-turned-hero. Some scenes, for instance, are raw, serious, and embody deep truth and humanity, as when Mildred becomes sort of a mother figure to Willoughby after he reveals a secret he thinks no one else in town knows about, or when Willoughby makes a major life decision that subsequently influences the behavior and compassion of others. \n\nMost scenes, however, only start out as if they will have something powerful to convey before descending into such brazen incredulity that we can't help but feel they're going too far and the movie is all too willing to compromise its own reality just to push the audience's buttons. For starters, I didn't buy the whole dentist office fight scene, which seems better suited for a horror film than a human drama. Or ta potential domestic abuse scene between Mildred, her ex-husband and Robbie, which ends up feeling more awkward than effective-one minute, things are violent; the next, everything is okay and nobody is talking about what just happened. And then there's an entire arson scene that comes off as loud and over-the-top, not only with regards to the action, but also the aftermath when James (Peter Dinklage), the \"town midget,\" as he is known, saves the would-be victim, who just happened to insult James earlier in the film. And then for the new sheriff (Clarke Peters) to believe James' story after the fact seemed kind of ridiculous.\n\nAnother flaw is the way young women are portrayed in the film. They're painted as either ditzes or bitches with no room or opportunities for them to prove otherwise. As Mildred's ex-husband's 19-year-old girlfriend, I doubt Samara Weaving is as clueless as the screenplay makes her character out to be. Would she really not know the difference between polo and polio? The same goes for Kerry Condon as the office assistant in the advertising office and Kathryn Newton as Mildred's daughter, who we see in a flashback. The only woman in the film with any kind of depth is Mildred, and perhaps the others were given less weight and dimension to make Mildred stand out that much more, but this strategy draws negative attention to their characters.\n\nUnfortunately, \"Three Billboards\"' fallacies get the better of it and they're what we remember most when leaving the theater, which is a shame because the film's acting and energy are so good. Each performer is on the top of his and her game here, displaying conviction, enthusiasm and presence in every scene. McDormand, Harrelson, and Rockwell have good chemistry with one another and are perfectly suited to their roles, always in control and never overreaching.\n\nThe same cannot be said of the screenplay, the events of which are just too convenient and leave us in a state of disbelief and disappointment. I'm all for the mixing of genres (why can't a tragic story about rape and murder also have darkly comic undertones?), but the various genres mixed into \"Three Billboards\" can't quite find a way to co-exist in a believable way so that we buy what the movie is trying to sell. McDonagh is no doubt a gifted filmmaker and I'm confident he'll return to a higher form of storytelling, the kind that seeks to arouse us with truth instead of play us with pretense.",

And really, that's what movies are for in my opinion, to get a specific emotion out of the audience.  Three Billboards was one of the most effective films of the year in that regard.  I felt every emotion the film was trying to convey, and to the film's credit, that was a widespread range of emotions.\n\nClassified as a dark comedy, Three Billboards is about a mother still grieving over her daughters rape and murder 7 months ago, so she decides to put up messages on billboards directed at the town's police department, and their lack of effort towards arresting the perpetrator.  A powerful synopsis at that, but the film never takes itself too far in one particular direction in emotion.  There are a few laugh out loud scenes but I was never taken out of the film with misplaced humor.  There were plenty of dark themed sequences and discussions had throughout the film, but they were far from being emotionally manipulative.  In that sense, this is easily one of the most well-balanced films of the year.\n\nLet's talk about the cast for a second, because it almost sounds too good to be true.  Frances McDorman plays the mother of a murdered child who is cynical and suppresses her emotions.  Woody Harrelson plays a hardened cop who is well-respected around town.  And Sam Rockwell is the lazy and vile cop who constantly doesn't live up to the expectations set by his peers.  Those three alone are perfect casting, and that's not even mentioning the supporting cast.  Director Martin McDonagh did a wonderful job of bringing Oscar caliber performances out of the three of them.  \n\nHe also manages to direct the film in an unconventional and unpredictable way.  Several times I was stunned by some of the decisions these characters made, but then after sitting down and thinking it through, it's exactly what those people would have done in those particular situations.  When a film can surprise you while never letting that surprise be manipulative, that's the sign of a great director.  If he's not nominated for best director, I will be very disappointed.\n\nAs I said up top, I want to be emotionally moved by every film I see.  Whether that be laughing, crying, or on the edge my seat with overwhelming enjoyment, that's all I can really ask of a film.  As Jim Valvano once said, there are three things you should do every day: laugh, think, and cry, and Three Billboards managed to put me through those three things several times in under 2 hours.  That's one heck of a movie.\n\n9.5/10",

The Amish parents of the children killed in the school massacre not too many years ago. Another example of a real hero, the ultimate hero- Did you hear about the woman who took in the killer of her son, and adopted him as her son?  Sure, women can be just as bad-ass as men.

            "content": "Mildred (Frances McDormand) is a divorced single mother working in the small town gift shop of the small town of Ebbing, Missouri. It's also been seven months since her teenage daughter was raped, murdered, and set on fire. She rents out three billboards on a rarely used side road to advertise her frustrations with the slow pace of law enforcement. The billboards say, \"Raped while dying,\" \"Seven months and no arrests,\" \"How come, Chief Willoughby?\" The chief (Woody Harrelson) tries to pacify the grieving mother while keeping his loyal officers in check from retaliation. Deputy Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is trying to apply pressure to get the billboards removed by any means. The small town loves their sheriff and turns on Mildred, which suits her just fine. The more people that disagree with her the more it helps fuel her sense of righteous indignation. Mildred engages in an escalating series of battles with the police and town that might just make justice impossible.\n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri feels like a Coen brothers' movie played straight, and it's borderline brilliant in its depiction of homespun characters allowed tremendous emotional latitude. These are people with complex depth who are allowed the power to be contradictory. They can be vicious one moment and kind the next, wise one moment and impulsive and self-destructive the next, capable of great acts of mercy and cruelty. This achieves two things: 1) making the characters feel far more convincingly drawn, and 2) making the characters consistently surprising. This is a messy movie but I don't mean that as any intended insult. It's messy in scope, messy in tone, and yet it thrums with the messy feelings and messy complications of human tragedy. What happened to Mildred's daughter is utterly horrifying and her rage is righteous; however, that doesn't sanctify her. She makes mistakes, pushes people away, and can be cruel even to her own family. I was expecting Harrelson's police chief to be a sort of villain, either incompetent or conniving, willfully ignoring the murder investigation. This is not the case at all and he is full of integrity and rightfully beloved in his community. As happens in many criminal cases, the trail of evidence just ran cold, but Mildred would prefer every male in the city, state, and even the country be blood tested to find a culprit. Her demands are fundamentally unreasonable and Willoughby points out the many civil rights protections in possible violation. Just because Mildred has been wronged does not make her the hero, and just because Willoughby is the face of local law enforcement does not make him the enemy. They are people with much more in common than they would ever admit. The awful circumstances of the plot have pit them against one another in an escalating tit-for-tat that serves as projection for Mildred's blinding fury against a world that would rob her of her daughter.\n\nThe dichotomy of sweetness and terror is best exemplified in the transformation of Mildred and Dixon, one of the most satisfying and engrossing film experiences of the year. Thanks to writer/director Martin McDonagh's deft handling, these two characters start at opposite ends and grow before our eyes. Mildred tests the limits of her resolve and anger and makes costly mistakes. Dixon begins as the screw-up with a badge (hat he literally misplaces) rumored to have tortured a black prisoner in jail. He seems like the dim-witted poster boy for unchecked masculine privilege. He feels like an enforcer of the corruption we (wrongfully) assume is at work in this small town. As Mildred descends into darker decisions, Dixon ascends and chases a redemptive arc, which is amazing considering the damning behavior he engages in at the halfway mark. These two characters start as adversaries and develop into begrudging allies in a completely organic way that doesn't blunt either character. That transformation is thrilling to watch and terrifically satisfying on its own terms. By the very end of the movie, I was ready and willing to watch its hypothetical sequel setup, especially if it meant I got to spend more time with these carefully crafted people.\n\nMcDonagh's film juggles many tones, effortlessly switching from laugh-out-loud comedy to crushing drama and back again. I was genuinely surprised how many times I laughed and how hard I was laughing. During my second theatrical viewing, there was an old woman in the back who was quite vocal in her bafflement about how anyone could be laughing. And if you were told the specifics of the plot and its heavy subject matter, I would tend to agree. McDonagh has a preternatural feel for how to find humor in the most unlikely of places. The humor dissipates as the film marches into its second half, a natural byproduct of having to raise the dramatic stakes and make things feel serious. This is the first grounded drama in McDonagh's filmography (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths). He doesn't shortchange the impact of his drama by weaving in more heightened comedic moments. The characters feel realistically developed and portrayed and are allowed to exist in moral grey areas. There's a minor character played by Peter Dinklage who is positioned as a romantic option and a bit of a fool, but by the end you feel degrees of sympathy even for him. Even this most minor of supporting characters (not a comment on Dinklage's stature) has earned your emotions. That's great storytelling but it's also tremendous execution from the director. Another sure sign of McDonagh's command for tone is that he undercuts his story's moment of triumph. I'll dance around spoilers but Three Billboards looks to end in a way where several characters would claim a hard-won victory, and McDonagh casually strips that away. Even though this is a movie, and even though there are moments of broad, irony-laced comedy, the complexities and disappointments of real life emerge. Even to the very end, Three Billboards doesn't follow the expected rules of How These Things Go.\n\nThe excellent acting gives further life to these tremendous characters. McDormand (Fargo) is radiating with ferocious resentment and indignation. Her character is a walking missile that just needs to be pointed in the right direction. Her stares alone could cause you to shrivel. McDormand hasn't been given a character this good in years. She opens up the full reserve of her deep acting reservoir, able to flit from great vulnerability to intense repulsion. She has plenty of big moments where she gets to tell off the disapproving townspeople and media members. It's ready made for easy laughs, but McDormand is so good that she shades those moments with subtler emotional nuance. You get the laugh and you also get further character insight. It's a performance of such assured strength that I imagine you'll be hearing her name often during the awards season. Rockwell (The Way, Way Back) has also never been better. He has to play a similarly deep array of emotions, from idiot comedy to heroic dramatics, and at every point Rockwell is stunning. He makes every joke twice as funny. When Dixon becomes a larger focus of the story is when he undergoes more intensive introspection. He goes from buffoon to three-dimensional character. Harrelson (War for the Planet of the Apes) also delivers a worthy performance as a proud yet wounded man who is trying to do right against a world of pressures and self-doubt.\n\nThree Billboards is an impressive, absorbing, searing film gifted with some of the best-developed characters in 2017. The portrayal of the characters is so complex and given startling life from such amazingly talented actors. You'll watch three of the best performances of the year right here. You get a really strong sense of just how life has been irrevocably altered from this heinous crime, not just with Mildred but also for the town as a whole. Things cannot go back to being the way they were. The characters you like can make you wince. The characters you don't like you might find yourself pulling for. Thanks to the complexity and nuance, the film delivers a raft of surprises, both pleasant and painful. These people feel closer to real human beings. McDonagh's brilliant handling of tone and theme is a remarkable work of vision, cohesion, and execution. This is a darkly comic movie that can make you bust out laughing and an affecting human drama that can make you cry. It takes you on a journey that feels authentic and wildly entertaining. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (which should have simply been called Three Billboards) subverts typical Hollywood clich\u00e9s by making sure, even during its wilder flights of comic fancy, that everything is grounded with the characters first and foremost.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

While it has some great moments, they are amongst some questionable performances and crazy plot turns that make this film unbelievable. Frances McDormand is the highlight of the movie with most of the best comic moments and heartfelt touches with Sam Rockwell also doing a good job and a nice performance from Peter Dinklage. Woody Harrelson is sadly miscast and pretty polarising as he can often be, especially with this jarring script of weird unrealistic dialogue that takes you out of the moment. Many of the characters face actions without consequence and while its black comedy sometimes works on the whole it lets down the drama and makes you wonder, what the film's message is trying to be.",

With a Coen Brothers type feel he created a fantastic movie. With a tremendous script and heartfelt acting from the fantastic cast this movie could have been about the literal life of a Billboard and I\u2019m sure it would have been enjoyable. The character development is great, the cinematography is unblantantly beautiful and the emotion is raw. Each character is felt for, even the ones you want to hate, by the end. Only complaint in this film and the reason it\u2019s not a 9-10, is the ending. Although I\u2019m a fan of an open ending, it\u2019s the way it was resolved that made it a bit more ambiguous than it should have been. It seems that there\u2019s only one way to read the ending but the way it was shown was that there\u2019s some alterior message to be received. Perhaps it was missed. I\u2019m curious to find out. McDonagh clearly had a vision when creating this film and that vision was perfectly executed. Martin McDonagh is quickly rising to the top of my favorite Directors/Writers list and I\u2019m excited for whatever project he takes on next. ",

So I have this secret film that is more brilliant, fresh, and funny than 99% of the cinema floatasm released this year, and yet I cannot share the parts that would be spoilers. It's is killing me!  Three Billboards defies some conventions of A to Z storytelling.  Yet, most of the visual camera pulls and tracking shots are within the movie making norms. The music from quiet piano work to pop, rock, and  classical background tracks are perfectly selected. All the movie making components point to character and story. At no point did I feel like I could have 100% confidence in what characters would do next. The characters are NOT 2-dimensional.  I don't know if this is best picture material but there are a number of performances that must be tapped for actor nominations. Chief among them is Frances McDormand as the aforementioned Mildred. She is fowl mouthed and kind of broken. Sam Rockwell is the wow of this movie with what may be the oddest gay undertone that I've ever seen in film.  Woody Harrelson, Lucas Hedges, Peter Dinklage, and others do really good supporting work. What can I say, I am kind of fond of slightly weird people.",

In Bruges, The Guard, Calvary, and War on Everyone - none of those were shown in the OKC metro area. I'm glad this one was, and theater was packed for an 11pm start time. Hope they show more like it. anything McDonagh Brothers do is great, same with JC Chandor. \nAnyway, Three Billboards is superbly cast and acted, nearly all performers were in previous McDonaugh movies. Rockwell is the star of the movie IMO. His portrayal of dark, unhinged characters is unlike any other actor.\nI haven't read about the making of the film yet, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was filmed in Ozark Country in Missouri, and it lends much authenticity to a film that very much drifts through shades of grey as there are no good guys or bad guys, everyone meandering through the shade of grey that reflects real life, where moral codes are bent and erected at surprising intervals. \nThought provoking films are the very best films, and Three Billboards is certainly that and infinitely better than CGI loades artificial pornography for idiots that lack both critical or creative thinking (like the superhero marvel BS)",

AND WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE SEE IN JOHN HAWKES? AND WHO CAAARES? i wont even bother replaying some of the other absurd moments in this film (woody with his wife at the lake with the kids - just make it stop) and does peter dinklage actually say \"little boys room?\" that was it for me. i could take no more.",

            "content": "I am, frankly, confused as to the mass praise this mediocre film has garnered. I was excited about this film after seeing the trailer several times, in spite of the fact that Martin McDonagh films have never been interesting to me. I stopped watching \"In Bruges\" mid-film. I went to see \"Seven Psychopaths\" in the theater and was bored.\n\nThe performances in \"Three Billboards\" saves this film from itself. Frances McDormand, while not breaking new ground in her character, she is a joy to watch, as always. Sam Rockwell is the most disturbingly enjoyable performance to watch as his behavior is so uncomfortable that one has to wonder how he got into such a mental state to be so unappealing. Woody, too, carries some of the most intense scenes in the film with a fantastic portrayal as Chief Bill Willoughby.\n\nWhere this film loses me is in its unnecessary and unsuccessful attempt to be \"quirky\" and toy with its audience. It's such an embarrassing attempt at \"artsy\" that it comes across a first-year screenwriter trying entirely too hard to be \"edgy.\" Yes, I get that irony of having \"Ebbing\" as the fictitious name of the city in Missouri in which this whole story takes place, as the entire perception and emotions of the main characters ebb and flow throughout the film, confusing the viewer into developing a belief or emotions about a character before zig-zagging into a completely altered perception of the character. This intentional mind-f*ck is elementary, poorly written and, frankly, hidden by how well the actors perform.\n\nThe bottom line of this film is that the viewer is supposed to see Frances McDormand one way, Sam Rockwell in the opposite way. Then, when the spindle of the film, the centerpiece, Woody Harrellson, dies, situationally, things change to alter how the viewer sees Frances' character and how the viewer sees Sam's character. There are many plot points used to create the details around why we see these two characters the way we do that, in this climax of Woody's death, are abandoned as \"irrelevant\" when we are made to see them a different way. Without going into a lot of details, the plot devices used are offensive, racially charged, homophobic, just disgusting on every level, which are items we've come to anticipate in movies from people like Quentin Tarantino, but they always seem to be relevant in the character and/or the plot. Here they are incredibly insensitive items, but then discarded as pointless for the sacrificial sake of forcing the viewer to change their opinion of these two characters. In the meantime, those plot devices are left there and leave so many unanswered questions, that one can't help but blame horrific writing for such careless use and resolution of those plot devices. It's astoundingly poor writing.\n\nIn the end, while the film intentionally doesn't end it the way most people would expect (which I'm fine with), and forcibly makes you realize that this film is about the change in its characters rather than wrapping up a typical storybook end, the flaws radiate more than ever.\n\nAs a result, I don't recommend anyone pay money to see this film. I also hope the white-dominant Academy and Hollywood Foreign Press see this film for what it is and not focus so much on the spoon-fed redemption, then judge it accordingly.",

Needed a script by someone with at least a basic familiarity with rural American cultures and human nature. There are scattered moments when the actors get to work without being dragged down by the script, and in those moments it's easy to grow hopeful about the whole endeavor. Sadly, there's always a tone-deaf set piece nearby to break the spell. By the end, I was rooting for the actors against the script and direction, losing any engagement with the ostensible story. Excruciating 90% of the time and frustrating in its moments of brilliance because one always knows they'll be fleeting. But if you assume that all Americans are barely sentient, hyper-violent toddlers with severe personality disorders (and there are certainly arguments for that position), you'll get to see those prejudices writ large here.",

Mildred Hayes is a hard, sassy talking, take no bull from anyone, headstrong woman who doesn't give an inch and gets laughs just by the way she delivers a zinger.  Her daughter had been raped, killed and burned alive 7 months before and the case seems to be cold and she won't stand for it.\nShe rents 3 billboards on a very seldom driven road stating 1) RAPED WHILE DYING 2) AND STILL NO ARRESTS and 3) HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY? Along with everything else Mildred has the guilt of the last words saying to her daughter, \"I Hope you do get raped!\" in anger and frustration with her. As horrible as that sounds you are on her side no matter what she does and says and you never know what that will be!\nAs good as McDormand is, and she is good, Woody Harrelson, as Chief Willoughby, matches her anger, frustration with the absence of leads and not being able to help the woman though they are alike in many ways. He has problems of his own to face and there is a 2-3 minute scene between him and his wife Anne, played by Abbie Cornish, showing what love is all about. He also, obviously, loves his 2 daughters.\nGiving Harrelson and McDormand a run for best performance in this movie is saying a lot and Sam Rockwell as a dim-witted, racist, violent police officer does just that. Caleb Landry Jones as the advertiser who rents the billboards to Mildred is fierce though seems to be a bit too young for the role. John Hawks, as Mildred's wife beating ex-husband Charlie and his new 19 year old girlfriend Samara Weaving are just two of the townspeople against her and the billboards. Lucas Hedges, as the son of Mildred and Charlie, definitely his mother's son, Clarke Peters is a new police chief while Peter Dinklage is a car dealer who gives Mildred an alibi when she needs one and Sandy Martin as Rockwell's mother all add to the movie.\nThis is a deep movie in spite of the foul language and the many laughs from situations, but it has many dark moments, a lot of violence, resolved and unresolved relationships and though all the characters are frayed in one way or another you come to care for them because of the screenplay and direction by Martin McDonagh.\n\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", aside from its cumbersome title, will be mentioned in many categories during award time and is a must see.",

As we saw in Logan Lucky earlier this year, peepuhl hoo tawk inna suthurn draawl is funneh. Look, I'll be the first guy to express my disdain for small-town, small-minded people with their antiquated political leanings and general ignorance of global socio-political realities. But they aren't all stupid, and watching somebody who I know probably has a house in Beverly Hills act like they're a redneck rings a bit false to me. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri certainly has that underlying the drama and dark humor. Many may know that director McDonagh hails from London, and in the past he has managed to effectively inject his UK sensibilities into the genres of crime drama and black comedy. It is a combo genre that has been defined and refined by the likes of Danny Boyle and Joel and Ethan Coen and rarely improved upon - with a particular exception in McDonagh's directorial feature debut In Bruges. That film seems to perfectly ride the line of gravity and levity in a setting\nhe knew quite well, whereas Three Billboards... just seems like the director is a out of his element. Don't get me wrong, Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell have always pulled off the rural American without trouble. It's just that everything surrounding them - the town, the political commentary, the minutiae -\nappear to be a cosmopolitan parody of small town life. There are so many moments where a character says something stupid because of their presumed, cartoonishly redneck idiocy, and the character opposite them, who is obviously more intelligent, tells them off in a smug, unequivocally concise manner. They do it so unflinchingly and premeditated that it rings false. Telling off a straw man, even if it is in service to criticizing the police state, racial tensions in America, and just plain, hateful ignorance, is still just telling off a straw man. The film might not have the lived-in authenticity of a film like Blood Simple but the frustrations and motivations of each character are fully realized. The story doesn't play out in a typically satisfying fashion, and the film ultimately becomes a rumination on closure and how we seek to attain it in a world where we take so much for granted and let things slide by. Our angers, our fears, our responsibilities - our procrastination of the soul and a pervasive sense of incompleteness eventually come back to haunt us. In that sense, in the face of it's subtle flaws, the film is existentially satisfying, if a bit depressing.",

The story becomes about the enabling and the redemption of a criminally violent male cop instead of treating the real theme with any sensitivity.  Trampling other sensitive issues such as race and dwarfism along the way. Everything from the young wife of the chief of police and \"young n dumb\" teenage girlfriend of the ex husband has guy goggles written all over it.  The only believable character was the alcoholic mother of the violent cop. The fact that this movie was given the budget to cast every talented indie actor you have ever loved and is now being touted for Oscar success says everything we need to know about how well the industry is dealing with gender parity.

This will also most likely be Martin McDonagh's opus in his entire filmmaking career, because topping this will be very difficult.

Every character was so genuinely human; I felt the emotions they experienced and understood everyone's motives and moods. The dialogue is sharp and just as brutal as the violence we see in the film. The tone perfectly fluctuates between serious and hilarious, and McDonagh entirely understands how to balance the two. Some scenes actually had me crying, then I found myself laughing without finding the shift in tone jarring, unlike other films that have trouble shifting tones effectively. The performances are absolutely top-notch, and worthy of some Oscar wins. I would not be surprised if this wins Best Picture, and I'm seriously hoping it does. I loved it. I really cannot speak more highly about it. I can't wait to watch it fifty more times. Seriously. Go watch this movie and support it. It is worth the ticket of admission.",

            "content": "I SAW THE SIGNS - My Review of THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI (3 1/2 Stars)\n\nWriter/Director Martin McDonagh (IN BRUGES) has never met a scab he hasn't picked.  He favors in-you-face, vulgar, highly stylized dialogue spoken by rage-filled characters.  His plays feel like an episode of VEEP, but with an Irish brogue; primal screams in the face of tough lives.  \n\nHis latest film, THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI is no exception.  Frances McDormand plays Mildred, whose anger at her small town police department stems from their inaction in the nearly year old unsolved case of her daughter, who was raped and murdered.  To shake them up, she rents the titular billboards to expose their incompetence.  Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) doesn't appreciate being called out, especially since he's dying of pancreatic cancer.  His none-too-bright Deputy Dixon (Sam Rockwell) has a very hair trigger temperament  and a history of racism and torture, and acts as Willoughby's self-appointed henchman to intimidate Mildred.  \n\nMildred, however, is a rock.  She's all stillness, cold stares, and killer comebacks in the face of adversity.  An early scene in which she comes home to see her son (Lucas Hedges) at the dinner table with their local Priest illustrates how far she's willing to go to maintain her stance.  In effect, she reads the collared man to filth. \n\nThis is all very entertaining material, delivered by actors at the peak of their talents. McDonagh wants to tell a revenge and redemption story set against a kind of cornball Americana.  It sounds like a winning combination, but something didn't feel completely right here for me.  As a meditation on long-held grief, it's quite moving.  McDormand does so much with such little movement.  Harrelson delivers a gut-punch of a performance, especially during a surprising and beautiful scene I'll only describe as the one with the cough.  Rockwell plays dumb and aggressive with much command and almost, almost, almost gets the audience to like him, but his past is fraught with so many horrors, I wrestled with that.  \n\nWhat didn't quite work for me is that we've seen all of this before from everyone involved.  Moreover, the direction leans hard on a type of staginess and suffers from a little too much small town folksiness.  It felt like every great line was delivered with a knowing glance as if to say, \"Check this. I get to spit out something scabrous and you're gonna love it!\"  You can almost sense the cast is holding for laughter and applause.  Don't get me wrong.  I liked this movie.  I liked it a lot.  But it lacks a certain grit in its filmmaking.  While the dialogue is witty as hell, it's a tad overwritten at times.  \n\nStill, the film sets up its characters really well in its first act.  It contains some great and shocking set pieces, those jaw-dropping moments that spurn conversations that begin with, \"Did you see that moment when...?\"  McDormand, when she's not mouthing off, does so much with stillness and has an uncanny ability to retain a little mystery even when we watch her thinking.  Some great actors fill in the supporting roles, to mixed results.  Lucas Hedges doesn't get much to do (no moving freakouts here), but he's appropriately solid and perfectly outraged by his mother's increasingly dangerous behavior.  Caleb Landry Jones, who this year alone has cornered the market on trashy sleazeballs, plays things more low-key, delivering a sweet performance as the manager of the billboard company. [Side note:  I found it hard to believe that a character as headstrong as McDormand's wouldn't bargain a little better when it came time to determining the cost of advertising.]  Amanda Warren, so fierce as the Mayor in THE LEFTOVERS, has an odd role as Mildred's co-worker.  She disappears from the movie at one point, only to reappear later, making it seem like Mildred completely forgot about her.  Something must have been cut out with this storyline.  Peter Dinklage gets a chance to play a shy romantic interest, and does so charmingly, but he's given too little screen time to really shine.  John Hawkes, as Mildred's abusive ex-husband, dominates his scenes, but the softening of his character, along with Rockwell's really felt off to me.  It's really tough to reconcile their redemption arcs when they've done such rotten things in the past.  Perhaps it's a lesson we all need to learn right now as accusations get hurled against seemingly everybody these days.  As such, it leads to a quite beautiful final scene.  While the storyline isn't completely resolved, we see a glimmer in the eyes of a couple of characters and some wry, sensational smiles that suggest that the human spirit can triumph over anything.\n\nSo why am I not as passionate about this film as I think I should be?  I've wrestled with that question for the past few days. It's really funny.  It's got the element of surprise.  It lopes along at its own dopey pace, giving its characters plenty of time to breathe.  It shows a new and difficult way to cope with loss and grief, which may inspire people to swear a lot and perhaps light up too many molotov cocktails.  If you're in law enforcement, you may feel emboldened by this film to indiscriminately beat people up in the streets.  Maybe it just left a sour taste in my mouth, which isn't such a bad thing, but something I'm not accustomed to in these black and white, no grey area times of popular filmmaking.  Could this be a masterpiece that I'll come to love some day?  Probably so.  See it for yourself and let me know if you agree.  I'm really ok being wrong when so many people clearly loved it.",

His latest project, the extravagantly named Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is yet another shining example of his brilliantly layered, infinitely entertaining and emotionally hefty writing. Three Billboards tells the story of a grieving woman who protests against the local law enforcement's inefficiency in solving her daughter's murder by putting up incendiary billboards. Dealing with themes of personal responsibility, social accountability and small-mindedness, McDonagh deviates from convention by going places most films are afraid to explore. His humor is dark and his violence strong, both being perfect vehicles to accentuate the chaos of interconnected lives, which the filmmaker uses to further dissect his nihilistic point of view. Led by the astounding Frances McDormand, Three Billboards is a film like quite no other, blistering with originality and acid societal commentary. Audiences will be pressed to find such a rewarding ride elsewhere this year.",

The characters are one-dimensional caricatures they evolve unnaturally or have uneven morality (why is so rude to the midget?).

The ending leaves no resolution to anything which I think is the point because that is what starts the sequence of events.  I'm a fan of Martin McDonagh's other films and maybe i'll enjoy this movie more upon multiple viewings but I am initially unimpressed.\n\nPart of the problem may be that I grew up in a small town and am familiar with all the archetypes in the film and small town corruption and police ineptitude.

Although the chief is making it clear that he is doing his best, she is blinded by anger, and is persistent, even though he is dying of cancer.\n\nThis is not like In Bruges or Seven Psychopaths, the director's two other movies. While the Coen Brothers style comedy is still there, it also has a heavy dosage of effective melodrama. The story is unpredictable, and the characters are likable. Even Sam Rockwell's character, who is initially not a very good person, is sympathetic near the end. It is, at its core, a story of the grieving process, compassion, and redemption. \n\nI will admit that even though I was definitely interested in seeing it before, it took the movie being the big winner at the Golden Globes this Sunday to actually get me to see it before it left theaters. But I am very glad I did. It is an incredible dark comedy-drama, and the best movie of 2017 that I've seen so far.",

Three Billboards tells the story of a mother who, sick of waiting months with no answers on who murdered her daughter, puts up three billboards outside her home criticising the local police. Frances MacDormand plays the fierce lead role. She is unwavering in her anger with the police department, and the entire town of Ebbing itself. Going blow to blow with them as each act get increasingly more violent. But you feel for her the entire time. With her daughter brutally murdered, she's got nothing left to defend but her billboards. It's not all fowl words and mean glares with her character however. She goes from being hilarious to breaking down into tears seemingly effortlessly. Sam Rockwell does a great job as the residential racist cop. His character has a unexpected range and growth. The other supporting cast including Caleb Landry Jones, Peter Dinklage, and Woody Harrleson are all great aswell. Director, Martin MacDonagh, brings his trademark witt and black humor to this film, but adds an emotional layer that his other films have lacked in my opinion. I know now that the ending won't satisfy everyone, but I thought it was a perfect way to close this film. A great blend of comedy and drama, Three Billboards is one of my favorite films of the year and will surly get MacDormand an Oscar nomination. 5 out of 5",

This film shows pivotal character transformations, and their redeeming sides and attitudes get revealed to show the audience their character at best.

Towards the end, we see that they are human, they make mistakes,they're flawed, they forgive others, and they have to deal with crap and move on-ward through a mysterious life.

            "content": "It goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult to accomplish. I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges, which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, which placed him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film to date, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure of witnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, this is a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I can recommend this film to everyone.\n\nAfter the tragic death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes calls out the local authorities on three billboards, publicly stating that they're not doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since the death of her daughter. While publicly displaying this is upsetting to some, she sees it as a point being made. Through some very cleverly written humor throughout the entire film, levity is brought to the table in times of sorrow, making this a very easy movie to watch. Although the story itself is quite depressing, this film is written in a way that will still find a way to make you smile.\n\nFrom the very first few frames of this film, you can tell the tone will be handled perfectly. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh with pure class, you can tell that he was very passionate when bringing this film to fruition. Every line of dialogue either progressed the story along, developed a character, made the audience laugh, or provided deep insight into the event of the murder itself. While not having the bearings of a conventional murder mystery, many viewers may not like the way this film concludes, but in the context of the movie as a whole and everything it's setting out to accomplish, it really does have a realistic and true finale.\n\nIt's arguable that some of the law enforcement officers play just as significant a role as Mildred does throughout the film, being pretty much present every time a revelation occurs, but I gravitated the most towards Officer Dixon. I've always been a huge fan of Sam Rockwell, and his character here is one of the most essential to this story, set on being there from beginning to end, trying his absolute best to be of any help. While Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Chief Willoughby is by far the most important to the story at hand, it's the characters around him that drive him to his actions throughout the course of the movie. The characters are truly what make this film as likable as it is, and they're all wonderfully drawn.\n\nOverall, when looking back on my experience watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, I find myself not being able to wait until its official theatrical release to watch it again. I found this film to be stellar in every sense of the word. From a noteworthy performance by Francis McDormand, devoted secondary performances, a screenplay that will have you consistently laughing, while also being emotionally involved with the serious storyline at hand, and pulling the audience in with its subtly composed score, everything about this film is worth praise. This was a huge surprise for me and I can't recommend you checking it out enough. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a fantastic piece of modern cinema.",

My only real complaint about it is the way it ended. I didn't think it was a bad ending, but I felt there wasn't much of a resolution.

            "content": "I don't think anyone can be like writer-director Martin McDonagh. If there is a talented filmmaker who can make a great dark comedy, such as \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" I'll be surprise by that. It's very obvious to see McDonagh getting inspired by Quentin Tarantino because, after all, he has made dark comedy films before, but his style is different. Most filmmakers have always tried to combine action, comedy, and drama in their films, and some of them end up being inconsistent. But that's seriously not the case of a Martin McDonagh film. When my favorite film critic, James Berardinelli from Reelviews, did a review of \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" he mentioned something that Roger Ebert has once stated before. It's that any subject matter can be used to comedic effect if the practitioner is skill enough. With James saying, \"McDonagh is skilled enough,\" I agree, despite the fact that he gave mixed reviews of McDonagh's previous films, (\"In Bruges\" and \"Seven Psychopaths\"). \n\nThe film opens up in a way that feels like you're watching a film by the Coen Brothers, with a score that evokes very similar to \"Fargo,\" (which, of course, it's all done by the same composer, Carter Burwell). Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) has been recently divorced by her abusive ex-husband, Charlie (John Hawkes), and she's living with her depressed son, Robbie (Lucas Hedges). Since she doesn't hear any reports from the police on the killer who raped and murdered her daughter, Angela (Kathryn Newton), seven months ago, Mildred goes against the police by sending a controversial message of these three billboards. Witnessing these billboards for the first time, the police, such as Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), and the rest of the town are finding this to be very upsetting.\n\nLike most of McDonagh's films or stories, he has always created his central characters that are mostly damaged, and with Mildred, it's no different. Mildred is trying to seek justice, but since she put these billboards up, the town is going against her and Robbie because of that. On the other hand, she's also filled with regrets and an immense guilt inside of herself. The most shocking scene in the entire film is where she's arguing with Angela. That scene explains why she feels so guilty to herself. Frances McDormand, (who's playing quite the opposite of her previous character, Marge, in \"Fargo\"), does a marvelous job on bringing Mildred to life.\n\nAnother performance I really like as much as I really like Frances McDormand in this film is Sam Rockwell as the hateful and na\u00efve Dixon who lives with his mother. From the beginning, we find ourselves disliking his character, but as far as the story goes, we started to see something better out of his character. The rest of the cast, (such as Woody Harrelson, John Hawkes, Peter Dinklage, and Lucas Hedges), give excellent support in the film, but there's no doubt in my mind that Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell are going to receive more credit than anybody in the film. McDonagh's screenplay is sharply written, and every set piece he puts in the film works.\n\nThere have been some shocking moments where I find myself uncomfortable, but the film gets better as it goes on. \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is the real deal for anybody who wants to see drama, twists, dark humor, and shocking thrills altogether. My full opinion: 9.7/10.",

The movie boasts an all-star ensemble cast lead by Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson. McDormand is at her best since Fargo; her unforgiving gruff exterior is punctuated with these beautiful moments of motherly-care and vulnerability. I think she should be a lock for a Best Actress Oscar.  As human beings, almost none of the characters are without sin, some are despicable, but the main theme that runs through the narrative is one of forgiveness. No one is irredeemable, and while that may be a frustrating sticking point for the movie's detractors, I think it gives the film a sense of hope that blossoms out of the bleak surroundings.  Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri serves as a harsh commentary on prejudice in America, but the veins of compassion make it the most genuinely moving movie I saw this year.",

Although not nearly on the same level as the aforementioned Belgian-set masterpiece, it's still got that blend of emotional drama and comedy that makes his work so entertaining and riveting. The first half, although good, wasn't quite meeting my (admittedly high) expectations, but something happens around the half-way mark that I wasn't at all expecting, and from this point on the movie was far more interesting. Although pretty much all of the performances are pitch-perfect, the stand out to me was definitely Sam Rockwell, who proves once again just what an underrated talent he is. Thankfully, he just won an Oscar for this performance, and I must say it is much deserved. The story takes twists and turns I never saw coming, and for all the crazy stuff that happens, the ending is a reminder of just how grounded in reality the film really is. This is an important movie with important messages, that manages to convey them in a discreet but highly effective manner. There were a couple of plot points and character arcs that felt like they were brushed over towards the end, and the first half has its problems, but this was overall a very satisfying and highly entertaining return to form for McDonagh.",

Tone, character, and even performances are a fairly mixed bag here, but the good is very good and ends up outweighing the \"eh\" (McDormand and Rockwell are especially sensational). Poignant themes of violence, revenge, and justice are explored with succinct subtlety as the film goes on, and they wrap up perfectly with the film's open ending.\n\n\nAlso...did not expect this to be one of the funniest movies of the year - our crowd was laughing on every beat.",
