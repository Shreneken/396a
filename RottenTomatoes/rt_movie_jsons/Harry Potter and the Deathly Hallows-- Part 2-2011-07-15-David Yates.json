Mas em si foi um final muito bom, com cenas maravilhosas. S\u00f3 mesmo o como o vil\u00e3o foi derrotado que me deixou 0,5% insatisfeito",

In this movie, there is three lead actors, Daniel Radcliffe ( Harry ), Emma Watson ( Hermione ) and Rupert Grint ( Ron ). This movie was published in 2009. \n\nThe movie talk about the three main characters in a magical World who want to stop the bad wizard \u00ab\u00a0Voldemort\u00a0\u00bb. To do this, they try to search the Deathly Hallows to weaken him. The plot is very absorbing because there is all the time action and movement! The special effects are stunning for old movie and the photography is breathtaking moreover the quality of the acting is spectacular. \nThe script of the movie is good but they could have done better for the first part. \n\nI recommend really this movie because it is the end of a big saga and it is a good end! This film was fascinating that why I give 5 stars.",

Not the best movie in the series in my opinion, but nonetheless extremely enjoyable. There are a few parts that still raise more questions than answers, but these do not spoil the overall storyline, and the sequence of events around the Elder wand is not particularly convincing - more a Scooby Doo explanation than Hercule Poirot. The final ending is quite funny as the actors have not been made to look old enough for the roles in the very final scenes.

In my personal impression, the saga is very good, since I really like magic, and the characters that come out are played by actors and actresses that I really like. A recommendation that I would give him would be that they had not made so many films, since some are filler.",

Truly epic in every sense of the word, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows- Part 2\" is a stunning and powerful achievement!  I don't think a better conclusion to such a beloved and magical series could have been obtained by changing anything in this film!  From start to finish the film is relentless, much like Lord Voldemort and the film's 2+ running time flies by in the blink of an eye.  We finally learn and accept the fates of all our characters and what their legacy is.  My favorite character throughout (Alan Rickman as Professor Snape) is finally justified and his childhood examined, giving tremendous insight and emotional pull to his actions.  During his final moments I was literally in tears knowing how hard his life was and the darkness he had to endure and yet in the end he was always a wonderful person at his core!  Not only was I emotionally devastated throughout the film but I was so thoroughly engaged that I could not take my eyes away for even the slightest moment.  The film brings together everything that made this wonderful franchise such a huge hit and brings it to the ultimate climax, deciding the fate of everyone good and bad in the process.  The impeccable special effects, wonderfully developed characters, stunning sets of the various settings, and all around general epic feel that I desired was given to me.  I could not be more happy with how it all turned out, however I shed many tears along the way especially when it came to Professor Snape and his sacrifices.  I cannot recommend this enough, although most have already seen most if not all the films, if you haven't you owe it to yourself.  You will not be disappointed!",

The big standout performance of this film, and maybe the best performance of the franchise was from Helena Bonham Carter who played Hermione pretending to be Bellatrix.  She was so convincing I had to get close and rewatch it to be sure it wasn't actually Emma Watson in a wig.  I have seen a few movies with Helena in them but now I think her talent have been seriously underestimated.  She played nearly the same character in most of the films I've seen her in and it is entertaining, but she is so much better than what she's been given for roles.",

            "content": "Here it is, a cinematic event to rival them all, the epic conclusion to one of the greatest franchises of the cinema. And what a grand finale it is. The end of Harry Potter's adventure is not just one of the very best entries in the saga, it's also one of the very best films of the summer. Thrilling, tragic, funny, touching, and--most importantly--magical, it's a film that ties up loose ends, reveals some surprises, and delivers a ride that takes you across the emotional spectrum. Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves by now have a firm hand on the material and deftly move us from the solemn opening to a teary-eyed finale. The pace here is unlike most any Potter film, probably since this is the most action-packed one yet. Spirited chases, an episode with a dragon, and rousing one-on-one battles are enough to get your blood pumping, and the dazzling visuals (often brought to life by the 3D) put you in the middle of the action. But what has given this series its juice is the cast of actors, young and old, who have brought these beloved characters to vivid life. Almost all get their moment to shine, although that crammed roster (dead characters also make appearances) can trip up the momentum the film has going for itself. But sensing the end, everyone commits to their parts with a heartfelt flourish. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are the heart and soul of the series, and have grown up with it. Seeing them wholly inhabit Harry, Ron, and Hermione's last stage in their emotional journey is one of the great movie going pleasures of recent memory. The other young men and women deliver the goods as well. Not to mention the elder thespians, who are superb, one and all. Michael Gambon, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman (especially terrific), Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt, Gary Oldman, Jason Issacs, David Thewlis, Julie Walters, Mark Williams, Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Warwick Davis, and best of all, my personal favorite, the regal Maggie Smith. The two new additions to cast are Ciaran Hinds and the great Kelly McDonald, and they leave sharp impressions. Everything comes together in such a satisfying way it's really hard to see where the story could go from here, despite what potential the \"next generation\" epilogue offers. Over the course of seven books, eight films, and ten years, we've gone on a magical adventure with a great hero to a world both wonderfully enchanting and humanly recognizable, and we've been happy to go along and lose ourselves to the magic of it all",

I can't think of anything else to say. But still, in spite of all the dangers that came throughout the adventure, I still had an absolute blast.

Yet, even though its hard to say goodbye to these incredible characters until next time, HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 2 brings in multiple opportunities for those that want to be witches, wizards, and incredible adventurers in the years to come.

There are a couple plot holes, lines of dialogue that reference book related material that was never placed in the movies, and an ending twist that kind of soured some of this movie's good will towards the end.

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nI have enjoyed all the films and love the books, and after how much I loved Deathly Hallows Part 1 this entry, continuing from exactly where the previous film left off, had a lot to live up to. It is less faithful to the mammoth but very interesting and wonderful book than its predecessor. However I found this, apart from one or two disjointed parts where you could tell that details had been left out and the arrival in Hogsmede and the duel between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix seemed a little rushed, had more flow, was better paced and had more coherent storytelling and less of admiring the scenery than the previous entries.\n\nWhat stood out for me was not only the darkness of it, particularly the last thirty minutes or so which was a tad anti-climatic but very intense too and also Snape's death, but also the emotional impact. Gringotts(especially for the effects, the dragon being the standout), the moving Ressurrection stone sequence and Harry's final scene with Dumbedore were very well done, but my favourite was the Snape's memory sequence, which was beautifully done and quite poignant. Not only that, it's my favourite Harry Potter scene alongside the Three Brothers animated sequence and the Cave Scene. The 19 Years Later scene was quite affectionate as well, with the use of the original music and all.\n\nOnce again, the production values are impeccable. The effects, apart from the odd ropey one in the Room of Requirement scene and Bellatrix's death, are excellent particularly at Gringotts, while the scenery and cinematography are magical with a touch of austerity too, and David Yates delivers his best directing job. There's also my favourite of Alexandre Desplat's scores, I loved his ones for Girl with a Pearl Earring and The King's Speech, the score was also one of the few good points about Twilight:New Moon and I found his score for the previous part very effective. What I loved though about this score was not just how beautiful, haunting and how incredibly melancholic it was, but also how much it enhanced the drama.\n\nThe script is very good a vast majority of the time, doing a noble attempt to stick to the spirit of the book. The humour is less stilted and corny than I can find it to be, and when the tone is tense and poignant the writing does an above decent job reflecting that. The pacing is never dull, if deliberately less rushed(Goblet of Fire) or glacial(Deathly Hallows Part 1) as some of the other entries, and the storytelling is always interesting and compelling while never convoluted.\n\nThe acting is very good. Rupert Grint is great as he consistently is, Emma Watson while not quite as good as she was in Deathly Hallows Part 1 gives one of her better performances of the series, Maggie Smith and John Hurt are always good value and while I didn't find him easy to warm to at first until Half-Blood Prince in his brief but relevant appearance Michael Gambon is also good. Helena Bonham-Carter, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane and Tom Felton while neither are at their best here bring a pleasing sheen to the film. Three actors in particular I found stood out and gave their best performances of the series. One is Daniel Radcliffe, at first I found him likable yet wooden with some questionable delivery, however overtime I think he's grown with more emotional range than usual. Two is Alan Rickman, while I have considered him one of the more consistent actors of this series him and the character of Snape really shine here, Rickman is especially good in the Snape's memory sequence. Three is Ralph Fiennes, I think it helps that like Snape Voldemort is given more scope here, that said Fiennes is appropriately sinister in the role and certainly looks the part.\n\nIn conclusion, a wonderful film and for me the best of the series. And I still stand by my initial feeling that it was better filming the book as two movies, it would've have felt far too rushed as one. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

Also, I LOVE the music of all the HP movies, so good job John Williams!

The simple cracking of Voldemort's face and then scattering away in the wind in tiny pieces was a complete slap in the face to audiences that deserved a MUCH more intense demise after following this movie series for 10 years. Lets face it, if we started our kids on the first movie at age six, they would have been sixteen when the last installment was released. I'm fairly confident they could have handled a more severe send-off to one of the screen's most hated characters. Did anyone in the theater you attended applaud loudly and yell vocally when Voldemort was defeated. Our's was packed and not a peep from anyone when he was killed by Harry. There you have it.

The plot revelations were the best part of the movie, followed by the special effects, then the acting prowess displayed by the leads (especially Fiennes and Bonham Carter in this one), then the dramatic and memorable film score. The most touching scene of the movie and perhaps the entire series for me was Hermione offering to go into the woods with Harry - it came off incredibly altruistic and human, hitting me right in the feels unexpectedly in a way that Snape's memories did not. There were some things I would've preferred to see happen with the characters than what did, though that's mainly a very minor gripe with the source material.

In the last stand battle of Hogwarts everybody showed their bravery. Dame Maggie Smith's Prof. Mcgonagall got a moment to show how badass she is taking over Hogwarts, and Neville Longbottom was one of the most courageous young wizards, standing up for the Dark Lord himself. He was so brave he earned the right to wield the Sward of Gryffindor and truly save the day. That said, the true sacrifice came from Snape, the most misunderstood hero of the story. He gave up his entire life and managed to live as an outcast for years just to protect Harry and fool the Dark Lord, he managed to have a final moment with Harry which just made me very emotional.\nThe final showdown between Harry and Voldemort was short and sweet. The Dark Lord's hubris lead to his downfall after our heros managed to take him down piece by piece working together, and utilizing the Deathly Hallows for good not for personal gains. The film then was bookended with a happy scene at the train to Hogwarts 16 years later, with the new generation of wizards starting their first year at the school.

It's a different viewing experience when you watch this movie after all the others. You catch details and connection that add to the overall experience. In some ways it is reminiscent of Avengers: Endgame in that, everything comes together without failing to deliver.

This film is the shortest of the series which means it is very faced paced compared to the rest. The film gets going very quickly and never really slows down because it doesn't need to. At this point they have developed the characters and all of the plot lines which mean this film doesn't need to set up anything, it just needs to close. Everything was ended in an extremely satisfying way. Whether it be the emotional end of Snape (Alan Rickman), the long awaited relationship between Hermione and Ron, or the death of Voldemort this is an extremely satisfying film.\n\nThe scene that gives me goosebumps whenever I watch it is when McGonagall (Maggie Smith) activates the guards. The combination of music and cinematography makes for one of my favourite scenes in the entire franchise. \n\nThe action in this film is extremely well handled and we get to see a lot of these characters get their moment to shine. In particular Neville's (Matthew Lewis) moment when he gives a heartwarming speech at then proceeds to kill Nagini is one of the greatest character moments in the series.\n\nThere are some confusing points in this film that I think definitely could've been polished up and there are a few to many things that happen off camera but it doesn't take to much away from the masterpiece that this film is.\n\n9.5/10",

Un altro problema di questi quattro film \u00e8 che non riescano a far funzionare correttamente il titolo al loro interno. \nLa battaglia di Hogwarts in questo film \u00e8 senza dubbio emozionante, ma poteva anche non ricoprire un ruolo cos\u00ec vasto da dimenticare il resto.\nAnche questo non lo giudico un film terribile, ma indiscutibilmente non un capolavoro.",

After such a long series, you're hoping that the end does the rest of the series justice and thIS movie doesn't disappoint in the slightest. It's the harrowing conclusion to Harry Potter's journey as he tries to put a stop to the evil Voldemort once and for all.\n\nActing: 10\nIt's not surprise that the acting is so stellar as these wonderful actors/actresses have had years to grow comfortable in the skin of their characters. Daniel Radcliffe continues to be sensational in his role as Harry Potter as he embraces Potter's ascension into manhood. Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) shine yet again playing his dedicated friends and sidekicks. You can tell that the three of them have formed such a strong bond over the eight movies as their synergy is extremely on point.\n\nBeginning: 4\n\nCharacters: 10\nThis final film pulls out all the stops as it's an all-out good vs. evil war. Teeming with amazing characters, I was hardpressed trying to uncover who exactly my favorite was. Potter is wonderful, yes, but so are dozens of others literally. I was really impressed with the maturation of Ron's character. It can be hard at times developing a sidekick but in some ways, Ron's journey to completion is just as satisfying as Harry's.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\n\nConflict: 10\nThis one is for all the marbles so they hold nothing back when it comes to amazing action sequences. The battles sprawl all across Hogwarts filled with dope magic and wonder. Sparks fly in abundance of blacks, greens and reds across a dark backdrop, a spectacular display. Sometimes you have no idea who's even winning, but it looks damn cool.\n\nEntertainment Value: 10\nPotter vs. Voldemort alone is worth the price of admission. The battle definitely lives up to the hype. Even moreso to see closure happen on every level is a welcome treat. Outside of a slow(ish) start, the movie is enjoyable from beginning to end.\n\nMemorability: 10\n\nPace: 10\nThe beauty of the final book being done in two parts for the movie is they definitely saved the best for last. All the best battles and memorable scenes are jam-packed into Part 2, causing things to fly by at a breakneck pace. Just over two hours, the final installment just flies by.\n\nPlot: 10\nJK Rowling wraps up this beautiful adventure quite nicely. The thing I keep going back to and have an immense amount of respect for: No loose ends. The stakes are higher than ever in this story that succeeds with a few cool twists along the way.\n\nResolution: 10\n\nOverall: 94\nThe magical battles alone are enough to make Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 worth a watch. With the combination of rich characters who each get a proper sendoff, a speedy pace, and a chunk of memorable moments, this is a movie to remember.",

There's just so much going on, and it's all so excessively dim...\n\nOver-reliance upon book lore has been a long-term problem for this franchise, and that issue has only grown more pronounced as the film adaptations enter their final stretch. I have no idea how anyone could make sense of Deathly Hallows 2 without keeping a store of such information, fresh and reliable, somewhere in their noggin. Maybe a Cliff's Notes handbook and a hair-trigger pause button would suffice. Casually tossing about complicated concepts like wand allegiance, multiplying spells, hallows and horcruxes, the film skims along at a high speed, in breathless pursuit of flashier material. Of that, fortunately, there's plenty, and those bits are loaded with well-constructed callbacks to the previous films. The action scenes are constant highlights, excellent in concept and in execution; a fitting farewell, in their own way, for the series at large.\n\nQuieter character moments are more of a mixed bag. Snape gets his big spotlight scene, after being completely ignored in the previous chapter, but most of the younger cast members are swept up in the desperate search for a soul mate. Everybody just wants to pair off, to hit that convenient epilogue with a litter of kids tugging at their shoestrings. Despite simmering for years and years, in many cases, such romances play more like a series of checked boxes than natural, heartfelt outpourings of emotion. Ron and Hermione are a prime example. The moment of their long-germinating embrace was evidently a difficult scene for the actors, who literally grew up together on-set, and their discomfort is clear on the screen. The kiss feels like an awkward, instantly-regretted smooch between friends, not a grand culmination, and that robs power from these beloved characters' storybook ending. They probably should've got that out of the way several movies earlier anyway. Here, in the midst of a hectic chase and a frenzied battle, even an effective payoff would've been lost in the mix.\n\nWhich is another recurring issue that this film never really settles. There's enough material for three movies in here (or a seven-hundred page book, as it were) and in trying to please everyone, to fit it all in, the whole package fades into a fleeting, dizzying wash. Nothing gets a chance to breathe, lest a different scene meet the cutting room floor. Crucial time is cut from meaningful points in the main narrative, dampening their impact, to cram in a few smaller, crowd-pleasing tidbits. But those, too, are over and done with so quickly that they hardly seem worth the effort.\n\nIn the end, we get (nearly) everything, without necessitating another weird mid-stream cutaway, but nothing is half as rewarding as I'd expected. A stumble over the finish line, in other words; a film that hits the novel's plot points but completely misses its spirit. Could've been worse, I guess, but it also could've been so much better.",

The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film.\n\nThe cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role.

The Battle of Hogwarts is amazing to see on screen, and Snape's memory scene is heartbreaking. Combined with a nice choir like score this Final chapter is almost perfect. The only nitpick is that the movie is very fast paced, making it go by very fast, and some parts do feel a bit rushed. This is my favorite Harry Potter film in the series. So 9.5/10, the ultimate Harry Potter movie.",

My biggest complaint with Part 2 is that the battles felt like cgi montages versus battles being described in the novel.

David Yates closed this series with a deeply moving conclusion to these film adaptations and I am amazed how well this two-part finale worked out, you can totally see how this last book warranted being split in two and it was honestly for the best. I am very pleased with how they wrapped up all of the plotlines and made them feel like a satisfying conclusion that we've been building up to for the past 10 years, the journey that these characters all went on was well worth the reward considering how many hours we put into supporting their development and it absolutely works for me, this was a great heart-wrenching finale with some really good action sprinkled throughout, it is pretty fast-paced and it never fails to entertain on every level including emotionally. The flashback with Snape and Lilly was so heartbreaking and well done, I felt for Snape so much and loved him even more as a character and Alan Rickman played him to perfection, scenes like that test how emotionally invested we got in the characters and for me, my heartstrings tugged every single time. This movie makes the weaker movies Half-Blood Prince and the Columbus films totally worth watching, not that they were bad, but they didn't stand on their own as movies nearly as well as the other ones, this pays off all of the time you invested in this series and it feels cohesive and complete. Another amazing thing in this film is that the stakes have never been higher and they feel so real, it feels like there will be consequences and it makes this even more intense, with the deaths of Lupin, Tonks, and Fred, it made everyone feel vulnerable and human in a world filled with magic, it got us to worry about everyone we know and made us feel justice when Harry achieves victory. I greatly appreciated that David Yates didn't milk this last movie by making it long and drawn out for no reason, it does its job quickly, it takes more time with the character development when it needs to, it isn't boring and it feels complete and satisfying, I only wish that there was more time given to Malfoy and actually having him going through with siding with Harry, his character arc feels incomplete and just hanging there with no resolution. This is the shortest film in the series and it works very well as a conclusion, it feels earned, the stakes are real, it consistently entertains and I get emotional every time. This is my favorite film in the series and it caps off this franchise very nicely.",

He crafted so many gorgeous shots, with a couple new creative tricks, while Mark Day's editing was absolutely seamless, really knitting the scenes together beautifully.\n\nDavid Yates let Part 1 take all the set up hits, and completely focused on making this a high octane, blast of fun! Yates does an amazing job of bringing all of the former events and foreshadowing together, to create countless amazing moments! There were so many twists and turns, keeping the narrative fresh, while moving at such a brisk pace with great momentum. Yates does a fantastic job of setting up this really dark and dreary tone, backed up by the amazing cinematography, and a great score, while really balancing the emotional keys well with the dark tone.\n\nIt has been a great honor and pleasure to have seen all of these characters grow and mature, over the seventeen years of the saga - it's truly sad to say that it's over. Yates does an amazing job of bringing in all of the characters from the past films, and balancing them super well within the narrative. There were just countless great character moments, displaying their true talents in their own way. After all this time, you can really feel and understand the characters motives and feelings, because everyone is fleshed out so nicely, having great chemisty across the board.\n\nAs a finale should be, the magic and action sequences were off the charts! It was by far the best showing of their magical abilities, having so many intriguing sequences! The amount of stakes that were set was amazing, having constant tention throughout the entire narrative.\n\nOverall, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, is phenomenal! It is by far the most entertaining film of the saga, and arguably the best; I just can't put it over The Prisoner of Azkaban!",

The way that the story unfolds is like nothing ever seen. In my mind, it doesn't follow the status quo of Disney or Paramount (love stories, buddy stories, road trips and such).\n\nThe characters are stellar. They play their parts phenomenally. The casting of Ian Hart, Helena Bonham Carter, and of course, Daniel Radcliffe was an amazing choice. The performances really dazzle audiences to this day. You can feel the warmth of the greeting when Harry comes to Hogwarts for the final battle. It gives off the impression that there really is such a thing as Hogwarts.\n\nThe setting feels so real and authentic that you sometimes wonder if it all was CGI and a blue screen.

As a fan of the books, I have some nitpicks but this movie is overall a masterpiece, the best Harry Potter movie and along with Return of the King, Avengers: Endgame and Return of the Jedi as some of the best endings to any franchise. The acting is amongst the best of the series, the score is spine-chilling, it's incredibly emotional, the stakes are high, the action is exciting and it's incredibly loyal to the book most of the times and the Snape's memory scenes are probably my favorite in the franchise. Well done David Yates! Well done to everyone who worked on this film! (A+)",

            "content": "A satisfying conclusion to the greatest teen franchise ever.\n\nDavid Yates directed a wonderful finale for his adaptation of J. K. Rowling's iconic children's series: Harry Potter. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part II (2011) is not only far superior to the dull Part I, but a tight picture that ties up all the loose ends, answering questions audiences have held onto for a decade, giving satisfying conclusions for all its characters. Yates directs The Deathly Hallows Part II with a focused perspective, swift pace, and attention to detail for explaining various mysteries left unanswered by previous films in the series. \n\nJ. K. Rowling's writing is precise and interesting as she connects the dots between Snape's deeds by shifting his crimes into sacrifices in a devastating final performance from Alan Rickman. Yates' direction makes Snape's backstory appear ambiguous like Snape could have even been Harry's father despite book implications. Rowling revealing that Snape had been protecting Harry due to his love of Harry's mother Lily Potter is endearing, devastating, and shocking all at once. Finding out Harry was a horcrux too, who needs to die is sad, but gets resolved in a neat way. I don't particularly care for the train station waypoint to Heaven as it's a very on the nose metaphor beneath the series, but it gets the point across I suppose.\n\nAlexandre Desplat's score is epic and sweeping with grandeur worthy of Harry Potter's finale. It's too bad it's not as magical and memorable as John Williams' original score, but Desplat brings fiery composition to his music. I'm quite happy Harry and Ginny end up together, while I guess it was fate for Hermione and Ron as their relationship was developed from the beginning. Daniel Radcliffe, Bonnie Wright, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint all bring their best for this emotional final film in the Harry Potter series.\n\nRalph Fiennes is fearsome and scary with his Shakespearean take on Lord Voldemort. Jason Isaac is great as the cowardly Lucius Malfoy, meanwhile Helen McCrory and Tom Felton are excellent as the redeemed villains Narcissa and Draco Malfoy. Helena Bonham Carter is excellent fun in a more playful role for Bellatrix in all her insane antics.\n\nOverall, it's a fun last movie that is emotionally poignant and enthralling narratively.",

The writing, story, plot, and screenplay were excellent. The maturity the characters had in this movie and how well-developed they have become was fantastic. The visual effects were spectacular especially the Gringott's dragon, when Voldemort blasted the barrier on Hogwarts, the Fire animals, Nagini the snake, and when Harry and Voldemort have their final battle. The direction that David Yates took this film was terrific. The makeup and hair was outstanding especially Griphook, Voldemort, Bogrod, and all of the Goblins at Gringotts. The costumes that ever actor wore were amazing. The filming was gorgeously done. The scenery and sets were awesome and beautiful at the same time. Also the films score was wonderful. This was a A+ film.",

This saga was written by J.K. Rowling, she divided the movie into 2 parts because this last production was too long for just one movie. The hole saga has as main genre, Sci-fi. The movie is main developed in Hogwarts, the famous wizarding school that in real life is Cambridge University on England.\n\nThis amazing saga impulse the carrier of many actors and actresses  like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, which in the movie act as important characters, someone who also can't get forgotten is Ralph Fiennes, the actor who gives live to Lord Voldemort on this last movie. They've got an excellent performance on this movie and people agree with this statement.\n\nTo understand this movie you just need to know something about the story of this saga. In this movie Harry and his friends are on the search for the horcruxes and they need to destroy them as fast as they can if they want to finally defeat Lord Voldemort.\n\nThis movie is pretty good recorded, camera definition is nice on the movie, soundtrack is really impressive in suspense scenes because it have the power to reach your feelings. \"The Final Battle\" or las stand with Voldemort is amazing by the way you feel after being by the side of Harry adventures for so many time.\nI will rate this movie with 5 stars, I'll totally recommend it to anyone who loves the wizarding and mysteries world and sci-fi movies. It's just an amazing movie.\n\n\nSome of the main actors of the film are Daniel Radcliffe that acts in this movie as Harry Potter, he is also well known for his appearance in the movie Jungle, another actress that its involved in this incredible movie is Emma Watson that in this time acts as Hermione Granger that is a character that made her win many great prizes like the one for best actress of People Choice Awards and the one for best cast of MTV Movie Awards shared with Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. Also someone else that acts as Lord Voldemort in this film is the actor Ralph Fiennes that has also got a great appearance in the Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nThe story was so amazing and impressive because in every moment something is happening and also because the story is related to magic it has many suspense scenes very often where there are many magic tricks and strange things.\n\nSome of the most impressive qualities of the movie are the soundtrack that changes in every time (walking at school, eating and when the children were doing magic). Also other important quality is the special effects that were perfect at all time when they were flying, playing quidditch, magic effects and lights. \n\nI rate this movie with 9/10 because the story was incredible, good special effects and the actors and actresses made a great job but it still need something that is a better end of the film. All people should watch this because it will give you suspense time and some laugh enjoyable moments, but you have first to watch all the previous 7 movies to know how is the story going. It will be the best movie you have ever seen.",

It's kind of like Lord of the Rings in a sense. You can't remake something like this that's already so great. I only wish the final fight between Harry and Voldemort took place in the Great Hall like in the book. That was my only problem with the ending of this film.

Having not read any of the previous books I did read Deathly Hallows and found the first part more faithful to the book with part 2 not having any character development nor story at all making this finale a big letdown! This is where some critics and some users alike get things wrong,they look at the fast paced,action packed movie as the best, when the movie that has character development and is a little slower paced because of it is seen as a bad movie! All movies 1-7pt1 are all good and are more watchable in my opinion.DHPT2 felt different than other Harry Potter\u2019s. It felt like just an experience rather than a movie.

            "content": "I saw this at a preview screening in London.\n\nDeathly Hallows part 2 ends this incredibly well produced saga with tremendous grace and a beautifully orchestrated climax that I am sure will satisfy both lovers of the books and films.\n\nIf you have read the books as I have you will be glad to know major key moments are intact. Much is missing but I won't dwell on that, no point, its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement, thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory (though a slightly rushed) conclusion. \n\nThere are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story. \n\nI have to say, that despite the woes we book readers have when elements (big chunks of it too) are omitted from the movies, much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen, cleverly weaving, changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.\n\nDavid Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.\n\nPretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out, Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch (if a little novel) but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.\n\nAnother actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has, is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.\n\nAs for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns, while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings, I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels (not to take anything away from Rowling's writing). \n\nDo I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.\n\nWhat an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew, maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.\n\nOh my god, its only just sinking in, this was the end....but what a great great end.An incredible journey that began a decade ago finally arrives at its close with David Yates' \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II\", as 'The Boy Who Lived' comes face to face with 'He Who Shall Not Be Named' in an epic showdown between good and evil. And what a showdown it is- tense, thrilling, breathtaking, and fitting of just about any superlative you can think of. \n\nWhereas the first instalment of the 'Deathly Hallows' emphasised the profound sense of loss and isolation among Harry, Ron and Hermoine, screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Yates leaves behind the moody atmosphere of the previous movie for newfound immediacy and urgency. This is all about that final battle where only one can live, and from start to finish- for once in a Harry Potter movie- the action is swift and relentless.\n\nPart II picks up right where the previous film left off- the dark Lord Voldemort smiles in evil triumph as he steals the most powerful wand in the world, i.e. the Elder Wand, from the tomb of beloved Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). The next shot is equally ominous- students are marched rank-and-file through a Hogwarts courtyard, watched closely by cloaked Dementors hovering over the school grounds. If there was any need of a reminder of the danger facing our three protagonists, these opening sequences should just about refresh one's memory of what is at stake.\n\nThere is precious little time to waste, and the first we get to see Harry, Ron and Hermione, they are already hatching a plan to break into Gringotts to retrieve a Horcrux. Their break-in settles upon a plan of deception that allows for some rare moments of levity in the film, as Helena Bonham Carter gets to ham it up as a polyjuice-disguised Hermoine impersonating Bellatrix Lestrange. This being the first 'Harry Potter' movie in 3D, Yates caters for some distinctive thrills in the additional dimension with a roller-coaster ride through the vault, culminating in a daring escape on the back of a dragon.\n\nBut as readers of the book will tell you, the last stand happens back at Hogwarts, and true enough, after this thrilling early set-piece at Gringotts, the trio head back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to confront their foes. It is also where the last Horcruxes are supposed to be, and Harry's return to the once sunny and cheery grounds now besieged by darkness and doom becomes a true test of allegiance. \n\nFans will be glad that Kloves gives room for otherwise supporting characters to step into the limelight- in particular, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) emerges as one of the unlikeliest but also truest heroes on the side of good. The Hogwarts stalwarts also get a chance to show off their magic, and Yates gives each largely enough screen time for the heroic send-off they deserve.\n\nYet he reserves the most emotional moment in the film for Severus Snape's (Alan Rickman) vindication, long thought to be the Judas Iscariot-equivalent in the Order and the one who pushed Dumbledore to his death. Yates delivers a truly poignant and deeply heartfelt revelation of Snape's true colours, and it is a farewell that even those who have read the book and can expect what is to come will be overwhelmed by its sheer emotional muscle. While Part II was always meant to be an action-packed spectacle, it is to Yates' credit that there is still as much heart as before in the storytelling.\n\nThough brief, this revelation also works brilliantly as a catalyst that propels Harry to come to terms with the sacrifice he has to make. Harry's realization of this leads up perfectly to the ultimate duel between him and Voldemort, one that is fierce, ferocious and- thanks to Yates' imagination- more exhilarating than reading it off the page. \n\nThe outcome of that battle shouldn't be a secret by now, and when the 'happily-ever-after' coda in Rowling's book set 19 years later is also faithfully adapted here, you can't quite help but be moved by how it so properly gives the series closure.\n\nThey are of course no longer kids here- Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson now young adults who have through the film series grown up right under our eyes. While Part I had greater emphasis on Ron and Hermoine, the focus here is squarely on Harry and Radcliffe truly shines in this instalment- his usual understated performance allowing his audience to appreciate the enormities of the challenge before Harry.\n\nThat we can be so fully immersed in Harry's world is testament to the craft of each and every one of the technical team. Production designer Stuart Craig does a masterful job portraying the devastation around Hogwarts, complimented nicely by Eduardo Serra's beautiful cinematography and Mark Day's skillful editing. Alexandre Desplat's evocative score, which combines his own elegiac work with both the John Williams theme as well as Nicholas Hooper's mournful composition for the sixth movie, works magic with the visuals. And most deserving of credit is none other than director Yates himself, who has matured movie after movie to deliver a crowning achievement for the series.\n\nPardon us if we have also taken this opportunity to extol the merits of the 'Harry Potter' franchise- it's really hard not to considering how this is the last time we will see the Potter-world in its current incarnation. It is this to which the movie is a farewell to, and it is as beautiful a farewell as it can be, packed with visual spectacle on a scale never before seen in any of the other films and fused with the same powerful emotion as Part I and the Yates films before. All good- even great- things have to come to an end, so there is really no better way to bid adieu than with this grand and glorious final chapter.I quite luckily got the chance to see this at an early screening on July 7th.\n\nFirst impressions of the film? Brilliant.\n\nDirector David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.\n\nThe film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.\n\nTheir final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.\n\nWhat I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.\n\nPart 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!\n\nThis paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.\n\nVisually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn't take away anything from the film, but it doesn't add much.\n\nI will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films. This truly is a fitting ending for the boy who lived.",

And what a battle.

Some things strike me as over the top, children story though. For one, why Voldemort would be so much an personal enemy of Potter and totally evil at the same time? That seems so mad and megalomaniac that few wizards would support him. Then, the fighting is so extensive and murderous, it seems too much, bordering on WWII. It seems that the forces at play are difficult to equalize. With so much power on each side, the outcome cannot possibly even out because it's practically impossible to stop either side from causing major casualties. \nRowling nevertheless is thinking very intelligently. Her stories are always satisfying an complex. \nI found the epilogue very charming. Excessively charming, with all our heroes having a mini-me or two sent to the school of wizards.

The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is Harry Potter who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort. It all ends here. \n\nEverything comes to a close here. A decades worth of Harry Potter films and eight actual movies later, we get a close to our beloved franchise. In all honesty, I loved this film. I think there's so much to love about it, as it's really a sight to behold. This is how you effectively tie up years worth of stories, characters, and memories. \n\nOne thing that this film has going for it is its soundtrack. Its score is flat out amazing and it adds so much to the film itself. After the film I went to Apple Music and downloaded my favorite songs from it. Yes, I put them on in my car and I felt epic while doing so. I guess what my point is, the music was well composed, it fit perfectly with the tone of the film, and it was memorable. \n\nYou see all the characters you've come to know and love fight in this final chapter. Because it's the final chapter, everyone's up for fair game (in terms of major events happening to them). It makes everything just that much more tense and it makes it more emotional. It's honestly hard to watch all these beloved characters fight out a situation so dark and brutal. It makes this film really emotional, as it toyed with my heart and did it well. \n\nThe visual effects and CGI were also phenomenal. This, along with its counterpart (Part 1) were both shot with gorgeous cinematography. If anything, this film looked as good, if not better than Part 1. The visual effects looked amazing, and it honestly looked better than some films today. There were some beautiful and mesmerizing shots, some that will become iconic in my eyes. \n\nIn the end, this film had heart, emotion, darkness, a bit of comic relief, and an all out war. It's the war you've been waiting for, as I certainly have been waiting. It's a perfect conclusion and better yet, a fantastic series of films.",

            "content": "And \"All was well\"- A series finale of Harry Potter\n\nMuch like a first-time reader of the Harry Potter series, this last movie dives straight into the action, with no apologies. David Yates, the director of the last few Harry Potter movies, waits for no one as he pulls out the big guns in order to give us this action-packed and heart-wrenching masterpiece that we have all been waiting for. \nTo say that he wasted no expense would be an understatement; spending a whopping 250 million dollars, Yates was able, yet again, to create not a movie, but an experience. 3D graphics and the infamous orchestra is but a small bit of the magic that allows viewers to walk right alongside Harry Potter, during his latest and greatest adventure.  \nWhat this movie carries most with it is none other than nostalgia. From the smallest of details like our favorite living pictures on the wall or even the sorting hat from the beginning of Harry's reign, all the way to the more noticeable golden nuggets like the Quidditch fields and forbidden forest, viewers will struggle to take their eyes off the screen as if to miss any one of these flashes of the past.\nContinuing on their final mission to defeat the Dark Lord, Harry, Ron, and Hermione travel to Hogwarts in order to find the last of the remaining Horcruxes. There, they reunite with old friends and loved ones. Secrets and blood are spilt, as the story wraps up, creating the finale of a lifetime.  \nWhat this movie carries most with it is none other than nostalgia. From the smallest of details like our favorite living pictures on the wall or even the sorting hat from the beginning of Harry's reign, all the way to the more noticeable golden nuggets like the Quidditch fields and forbidden forest, viewers will struggle to take their eyes off the screen as if to miss any one of these flashes of the past.\nBut if you are looking for another butter beer-soaked love triangle, you will not find one here. Much like the characters, the film has grown up. No longer will we see lighthearted house rivalries, rather, viewers will experience the thickening darkness that he \"who must not be named\" brings. Scenes with blood-soaked floors and death in every corner are what make this movie one of a kind. However, Yates does not leave us in the cold for good; a tasteful bit of humor is injected throughout the movie as to keep the viewer not only entertained but also emotionally stable. \nAlong with accustomed places, there are also familiar faces to look forward to in this series finale, as well as, a deeper insight into who each of them really is. Snape is FINALLY given the credit he deserves as Harry learns the truth about? his courageous (and selfless) past. Neville is also given the opportunity the be the hero Voldemort decided he couldn't be; the scene with his execution of Nagini paints him as strong and brave, much like the Gryffindor ancestors he exemplifies. \nAs far as the relationship between the book and the movie, Yates does a pretty fantastic job sticking to the roots of what made this story the billion-dollar franchise it is. However, there is one difference that sticks out like a sore thumb. Voldemort's death. Unlike the book, this movie portrays this super villain's death of one of absurd, exploding skin confetti. Not only does this make no sense, it also does a complete injustice to all the hard work J.K Rowling put into demystifying the Dark Lord in all her books.\nAll in all, this is one to remember. Deathly Hallows part two is much more than tying up of loose ends, it is the reality of most of our childhood fantasies. A beginning scene of the rollercoaster ride in a cart at Gringotts is an accurate example of what viewers will experience in this last tale of Harry Potter, a surplus of action and a reshaping of identity.",

            "content": "Harry Potter for the Win\n\nThe ending to one of the most iconic film franchises the world has ever seen did not disappoint. David Yates has a masterful performance with the flow of the movie, and Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have truly grown into fabulous actors over the last 10 years. You will leave the theater asking for more, but everything good must have an end.\nChances are, if you are reading this review, you are on the fence whether or not you should invest time getting into the Harry Potter series. Having seen all of the movies, I would recommend you do, because the movies and story are very entertaining and will leave you wanting more. If you do not want to read the books or do not have time to watch all of the movies, I would advise you to start by watching the fourth movie to get a good grip on the story line.\n\tIn the Harry Potter series, we journey with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), as they discover what magic really is and learn their first spells in order to defeat fierce creatures such as dragons, werewolves, and Basilisks (huge snakes). We are with them every step of the way, including the conclusion of their story, when they look to end their fight against Harry's arch-nemesis, Lord Voldemort.\nHarry, accompanied by his two best friends, journeys throughout the land, completing the almost impossible task of finding all the pieces of Lord Voldemort's soul in order to destroy him once and for all. Having spent his entire life suffering through the fact that he lost his parents and did not learn who he really was until age 11, you effortlessly step in Harry's shoes as he journeys through Hogwarts and beyond. \n\tHarry sees many people he loves die for the cause of defeating Voldemort and his followers once and for all, and even sees a man who he has grown to hate, his former Potions teacher, Professor Snape, a man believed to be working for Voldemort, be murdered by his master in order to obtain more power.\nHaving the ability to see certain memories Professor Snape had, even after death, Harry has revealed to him two shocking truths: Professor Snape, a man so hated by those on  the other side, has secretly been helping Harry throughout his 7 years of school and travels, and that in order for Harry defeat Voldemort, he must die, because part of Voldemort is inside of Harry. \nAs a member of the audience, you immediately feel for Harry, he having worked tirelessly at the risk of his own life and the lives of those he loves, only to find out near the end that he needed to die. \nHarry knows and is willing to sacrifice himself and finally understands the use of an artifact he obtained earlier, a stone he could use to see those closest to him who have moved on to the other side of the veil, such as his parents, whom he has never met before in his life.\nEverything is brought to one final duel between Voldemort and Harry, a fight with so much on the line that it rivals other notable fights, such as Darth Vader vs. Luke Skywalker or Rocky Balboa vs. Apollo Creed.\nIn the end though, good triumphs evil, the brave beat the cowardly, the boy who lived beats the seemingly immortal man, and the threat of a dictator over the magical world in Europe is dismissed by the love and courage of a 18 year old boy.\nDavid Yates did a masterful job organizing the scenes, having it all tie in together, and makes you leave the theater with no regrets, no thoughts of \"I wish they had done this\", nor questions unanswered. It was a truly masterful performance over all.  \n\nRating: 3.7/4",

Something I've loved about the later Potter flicks is how much always appears to be at stake. They never seem flippant or inconsequential, and there's always an emotional reward at the end. Deathly Hallows Part 2 continues, and concludes, this trend, but things are a bit scattershot this time round. The battle is great, but not entirely focused. Voldemort is, in my opinion, a pretty rubbish villain, spending a lot of his time standing around and pulling faces and saying faux-menacing things while his hench-people do all his dirty work. The battle with Harry isn't anywhere near as epic as I was expecting, and while it felt good when it was over, I'm sure it could have felt much more profound. But with the stunning, haunting visuals, the complete maturation of the characters and the rounding up of one of the best film series in history, it's a film to get excited about, indulge yourself in and feel genuine sadness about the fact that its all over.",

The Deathly Hallows Part 2 checked off just about everything I could have asked for.\n\nWe begin part 2 still in search of the Horcruxes as well as finding Voldemort's army at its strongest.  I think what's most impressive about this particular installment is that it manages to pull off the \"all pay-off\" type of story that most part 2's have struggled with.  Both, The Hunger Games and Hobbit series' have had a rough time closing out their series' with a film that feels whole in itself.  Sure, you can't really have the full experience without at least watching Part 1, but there's no part of me that thinks this story could have been pulled off in one film.\n\nEven with all of the cameos and reappearances of beloved characters, there's plenty of new ones as well.  Ciaran Hinds' Abeforth Dumbledore for one, Helena Ravenclaw, a nearly-blind Dragon from Gringott's, and oh yeah those kids at the end.  J.K. Rowling has a knack for giving everyone a chance to shine, and there's no difference in Part 2.  Seriously, I never would have thought Neville would be the one to kill Voldemort's snake, Nagini, but that's why it was so brilliant.\n\nThis is also the film in which all was revealed about Snape and his allegiance to Harry after all.  The first time I watched this entire sequence, it absolutely broke me.  To watch a guy so hopelessly in love with someone he can never have, and then look after her son even though he despises the very presence of him, is so beautiful and tragic at the same time.  It's something only the likes of J.K. Rowling could handle with such grace.\n\nHarry himself goes through perhaps his biggest character arc since the middle of the franchise as he's forced to come to grips with the fact that he is the 7th horcrux after all.  Even though we ultimately knew he was going to have that showdown with Voldemort at Hogwarts, but his goodbyes to Ron and Hermione, and ultimately his discussion with The Order in the Forest, were some of the most touching scenes the franchise has given us.  This also gave us one final scene with Michael Gambon as Dumbledore's spirit, so to speak.  Of course, I'm a bigger fan of Richard Harris' work as the great wizard, but Gambon's spin on the character definitely grew on me.  Especially when watching them all back to back.\n\nEverything about this film is epic in scale and emotion.  Even if you know when certain things are going to happen, they are written and presented in a way that's undeniably satisfying.  I know some think the \"19 years later\" scene is hokey, but for me it's the perfect culmination of everything that the series has brought thus far.  Harry finally got to experience King's Cross Station with his family, and he honored Snape and Dumbledore with his son's name.  It's just perfect.  After re-watching the 8 films within days of each other, I can say that this without a doubt in the top 5 of my favorite film franchises of all time.  And The Deathly Hallows ended it with a bang.\n\n+Everyone gets a chance to shine\n\n+Battle for Hogwarts\n\n+Snape reveals\n\n+The ultimate sacrifice\n\n+19 Years Later\n\n10/10",

            "content": "An end to a story, an end to an epic, an end to he-who-must-not-be-named! \n\nOver a decade in the making the wizarding world draws wands for the very last time in a worthy farewell. The escalation to a final battle between good and evil forces hits its crescendo and we are drawn back into the most vivid and quietly brilliant cinema-scapes of all time.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 sees the culmination of a dynasty, the shortest chapter brings about the completion to the longest marathon of magical mythology. With approx 1194 minutes of screen time, over 7 billion at the box office, all seven of it predecessors present in the top thirty of highest grossing films ever, its own theme park in Orlando Florida and infinite fans worldwide, we witness the passing of a monumental pop-culture milestone. \n\nIf living up to the hype and pleasing everyone isn't hard enough, this final film presents the gargantuan challenge of a mountainous plot to climb (even if it was split in two). Screenwriter Steve Kloves is in the unenviable position of making the vexing decisions of exactly what can stay, without sacrificing forward momentum. \n\nQuibbling over these omissions is part of the fun and frustrations of this gripping franchise, and critics always take pleasure in playing devils advocate. However, this herculean effort to juggle colossal action scenes, with emotionally depth, sideways jaunts into metaphysical memories, and a functional rendition of a labyrinthine plot, is just brutal and unwarranted nitpicking. \n\nAs each preceding chapter has revolved around solving a mystery, in Part 2 there is no mystery, its time for action. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are in pursuit of the final scattered horcuxes which harbour pieces of Lord Voldemort's fractured soul, tethering him to this world. \n\nHaving escaped Gringot's bank by the skin of a dragon's neck, all plans lead back to Hogwarts. Once safe haven boarding school, it is now a melancholy fascist camp under Snapes control. Breaking in through a secret passage, Harry's re-emergence drives the resistant group into battle.\n\nHogwarts becomes a stronghold; a battlefield under attack from an army of Deatheaters, Dementors, giants and beasties defended by small dwindling group of teachers, students, parents and castle ornaments. \n\nEvery surviving character of the franchise accounted for, lesser villains get their comeuppances, heroes fall and Hogwarts crumbles in a thrilling convergence of drama, intrigue and emotion. \n\nSuffering slightly from its urgency, some characters hasty send-off's are disappointing unexplored, leaving you wanting. Thankfully, Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) get their lightening moments to shine and the truth behind Alan Rickman's sneering Professor Snape is uncovered in one of the most moving scenes of the series. \n\nThe tangled Dumbledore family back-story has been simplified, a few characters have been removed, Voldermort's snake Nagini is over highlighted and some fundamental rules have been bent. Eduardo Serra's cinematography captures your attention so completely, that the collaborative phenomenon between page and screen means they can each offer something unique.\n\nA warning: It has always been said that the movies grow progressively darker with the age group of its original audience and with this it is evident. As Harry solemnly walks through the great hall, the visual proof of the devastating human cost for his defiance is genuinely moving; and the crossroads platform he reaches and witnesses the dying form of a piece of Lord Voldermort's soul is rather a shock. \n\nThe Verdict: With the last incantation spoken and the final flourish of a wand, the Potter legend reaches its resting place in a magnificently magic movie. \n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 15/07/2011",

            "content": "It's a satisfying conclusion. Though, I am left with some questions about the series as a whole, including the following plot devices (i.e., spoilers).\n\n- The character of Luna Lovegood never feels relevant to any of the movies. I was constantly anticipating for her character to make a meaningful contribution to the story, but it never happened. I\u00e2??m wondering if the character could\u00e2??ve been left out of the films without consequence.\n\n- Likewise, Draco Malfoy doesn\u00e2??t seem to reach his full potential as an important part of the story. There are plenty of opportunities for him to matter, but each time, he\u00e2??s made to be a passive, unnecessary component to each of the story arcs. I would\u00e2??ve liked to see him make a commitment - for better or worse - by the end. Alas, he\u00e2??s ever-drifting with the flow.\n\n- How did Griphook the Goblin die? There is nary an attempt at explaining how he went from escaping Gringotts to being a lifeless body.\n\n- I stated this in my critique of Prisoner Of Azkaban, and it needs to be re-said here: Hermione owns a device that can reverse time. Why is it used in one fleeting incident early in the series, and never again? Wouldn\u00e2??t the Battle of Hogwarts been an opportune moment for such a device? And surely Hermione isn\u00e2??t the only wizard who has a device of the sort, right? The use of this as a subtle plotpoint in an earlier film, and never again mentioned going forward, amounts to a significant plothole.\n\n- In Part One of the Deathly Hallows, some time is spent discussing a potential betrayal before the Battle of the Seven Potters. That is, it appears a member of the Order of the Phoenix tipped off Voldemort\u00e2??s forces about their plan, because how else would they have known to be waiting? In neither of the Deathly Hallows installments does this get explained. It\u00e2??s made to be a big deal in Part One, and absolutely absent of consideration by Part Two.\n\n- Speaking of unnecessary betrayals, Snape\u00e2??s \u00e2??betrayal\u00e2?? doesn\u00e2??t seem like a relevant plotpoint in the end. It\u00e2??s used for a magnificently interesting \u00e2??aha\u00e2?? moment in the last 30 minutes of the series, but in terms of its usefulness for Dumbledore or Snape or Potter\u00e2??s cause, it\u00e2??s moot. Snape tricking Voldemort into believing he\u00e2??s a loyalist to the dark forces never helps Potter\u00e2??s cause, and only serves to incite Snape\u00e2??s destruction. What was the point of tricking Voldemort into buying into Snape\u00e2??s loyalty if it\u00e2??s never used for any benefit?\n\n- As Snape dies, Harry bottles Snape\u00e2??s tears to get some revelatory information about Snape\u00e2??s purpose and Voldemort\u00e2??s weaknesses. It works well and fine until you ask yourself, what if Harry hadn\u00e2??t been there as Snape died? What if Harry walked in on Snape\u00e2??s lifeless body just three minutes after death? Harry wouldn\u00e2??t have understood his role as a horcrux, and that probably would have significantly altered his approach to confronting Voldemort. For a school of \u00e2??wise wizards,\u00e2?? it feels like a massive oversight to leave something like that to chance.\n\n- How did the Sword of Gryffindor reappear at Hogwarts for Neville to use? Again, no real explanation.\n\n- How did Harry come back to life after Voldemort killed him? I\u00e2??m not saying that the explanation they gave was bad, I\u00e2??m just saying there wasn\u00e2??t an explanation. And if Harry can come back, then why can\u00e2??t any of the other dozens of characters come back to life after their untimely deaths throughout the series by the same means that Harry used?\n\n- The storyline of the three pieces that make up the Deathly Hallows quickly became irrelevant. There was never any acknowledgement from anyone that Harry was in possession of the invisible cloak, and the resurrection stone didn\u00e2??t seem to serve any purpose - so much so, in fact, that Harry tosses it within moments of finding it.\n\nI have to assume that some of the aforementioned questions have answers in the book version of the series. In terms of the cinematic experience, though, I felt a little lost at times - there needed to be more hours spent in the editing, of which I\u00e2??m certain there were already countless hours of.\n\nAs for the series as a whole, I found it decent but not phenomenal. It\u00e2??s my personal opinion that this series didn\u00e2??t warrant the massive following it garnered, but at the same time, this was an overall enjoyable experience for me. The cinematic series did some things rather poorly, but also had moments of brilliance. Further, it\u00e2??s amazing that with 8 movies filmed across a decade, only 1 of the major characters had to be recast, and all of the young 10 year-olds cast in the original film had serviceable acting skills into their adulthood. There\u00e2??s a lot of risk in doing a series like that - just ask the \"Chronicles Of Narnia\u00e2?? filmmakers, or the writers of TV series \u00e2??LOST.\u00e2?? Where other series failed in this capacity, Harry Potter knocked it out of the park.\n\nThis series had an adequate amount of appeal and execution, and I stand by my initial sentiment: this was a satisfying conclusion.",

This film quickly redeems the unfinished feeling felt after Part 1 and although dark, brings much more light than seen in the sixth installment. What is maybe the best thing about this film, is that it never forgets its foundation. All the students from the original film are back and many have their own moment to shine. Neville Longbottom even has his shining moment. It has so many giddy call backs to the series' history that will make the fans who miss the happier and more magical tone of the first films ecstatic. \n\nBest of all, that final confrontation. The tension between Voldemort and Harry has never been higher, the stakes never more dyer, and the conclusion is just too satisfying. \n\nThis film does have some minor nit-picks holding it back from taking my favorite spot (still held by the Goblet of Fire) and most of these are continuity questions I have that are unanswered. To avoid spoilers, these will remain unlisted.\n\nI had fun emerging myself back into this franchise and am quite sad to see it end.

A lot of deaths in this movie, so get ready for it. Harry, himself, isn't the most interesting protagonist, but I give him a pass, as he is only 17 or 18, and let's be honest, no one really made the best choices at that age. \n\nSnape's reveal was a big shock for me. I read the books after I saw the movies, so I was pretty shocked to see that he wasn't working for Voldemort at all. Complex character, whether you like him or not, and always my favorite. The build-up was good and the action was okay. Only downside was the fall of Voldemort which was really lame and the final battle between him and Harry was a huge let-down with a few comebacks, a slap, and randomly jumping...off a building...I don't know. \n\nThe epilogue, while I did smile a bit while watching it, could've been left out for the Director's cut or something.

And everything in here is just fantastic. As I follow the whole HP series, \"Deathly Hollows pt. 2\" is just enthralling and bone chilling at the same time. A nail biting edge-of-your-sit experience. It was all magical, as Potter together with his close friends, Hermoine and Ron, are in for the adventure as they continue to search for the remaining Horcuxes and to destroy all of it. I really like the story telling development. That also leads into some interesting scene of events which intrigues me a bit. Who knew that Serverus Snape is such an important character of the series. The fun begins in the 2nd half of the film, when the army of darkness collides with the army of Hogwarts. The visual effects of that epic battle scene is just fantastic. The part where the Hogwarts professors cast a huge ball of shield named \"Protego Maxima\". As were professor Minerva McGonagall cast the guards of Hogwarts named \"Piertotum Locomotor\". And that leads to an epic clash of huge Orcs against Dumbledor's armies. All of these epic proportions happening into an one epic war. The last battle between Harry Potter against Voldemort. I was like, \"that my friends, is what you called epic boss battle\". I love what they did on the fight scenes with great special effects which causes more epic proportions. If you're a HP fan or a movie goer who just happen to watched all of these films. You would definitely enjoy it. From top to bottom, I was really into it. I can't even nod just to concentrate nor I was stunned on the whole movie. Amazing performances as usual, great visual effects as usual (much better this time though) and superb cinematography and production design. A movie of a magical tale, with love and friendship. Mystery and dark magics. All on this one hell of a fantasy, that everybody loves. Superb job to all of the film makers who made this film possible in a very fantastic way, and to the creator herself, J.K Rowling, thank you ma'am for your brilliance. Thank you for making this fantasy masterpiece that we would never forget for a very long time. 5/5.",

I think that, story wise, the thing that hurt this movie the most was the inability of the previous films to build up all the necessary emotions around the major characters.  I feel like the Harry/Snape relationship and the tension around that was heavily underdeveloped for the whole film series, and as such, the pay off in the climax of this film is dulled compared to the novel.  But the action and the visuals were some of the best of the series, which was good.  And the film did feel like a nice wrapping-up of a long tale, which can be tricky sometimes.

The stakes are decently high, perhaps for the first time for our heroes, who benefited from the invincibility of the children's nature of the first few films. Voldemort is still an ineffective and unbelievable villain, but thankfully his screen time in minimized in favor of Harry's search for the Horcruxes. The romances between Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione are as fake as they can get, a testament to the poor writing skills and dedication of their overrated creator, but regardless, we still love their characters. Overall, the Harry Potter finale is as a good as it can get and then some, a testament to the directing team's ability to pull something salvageable out of the gibberish that is J.K.

Every actor has brought their A game in this movie, including Alan Rickman who can actually be really good at being emotional which might get the viewers to cry. It's really emotionally resonant that I was close to crying, and the soundtrack by Alexander Desplat is magical and just amazing. The special effects are are definitely extravaganza, and it just looks amazing. The action scenes are amazing and exciting, but never seem to take away from the plot either. Steve Kloves did a great job with the script and develop the emotional scenes very effectively. The camerawork is amazing, and there's a bit of differences between the book and the movie that I actually thought that the movie did better. The plot is really good, and it explained everything that's relevant to the movie while having a lot of funny moments. The movie does the Snape backstory very respectively which everybody, including me, were relieved that they did it well. The series is the best I ever seen, and nothing can top it. When it ends, I felt very satisfied with it and in a way, it grows me up like the movies do, and got me into any movie.

You may wonder why it took me so long to finally watch it. It is simple really, after watching Part 1, I was really disappointed, thus in these instances, if there is another sequel I would NOT make it a priority to watch it. Hence, I might wait for the DVD release instead of actually watching the movie in a theater. In this case with Part 2, I just basically forewent with the DVD release altogether, waited three years to borrow a copy from my sister and waited another year to actually watch the movie.   Procrastination at its finest! \n\nThis sequel to a rushed and bleak Part 1 is actually better constructed. Indeed, Part 2 has murky and dark undertones to it, almost reminiscent of the 1950's Films Noir. As a result, leaving me pleasantly surprised and also proven somehow wrong about the director, David Yates. \nHe manages to correct most of the things that I found to be inadequate in Part 1 and ended everything on a positive note.  The movie is basically built towards the final battle between Good and Evil, impersonated by Harry Potter and Lord Voldermort, which also happens to be the much anticipated climax of the franchise. The film allows the viewers to be truly immersed into the story by having strong characters development on top of well put together plot.  Most loose ends of Part 1 are resolved in this final installment, thus adding to the strength of the plot. \nA bonus dream scene is also to be looked forward to seeing, as it provides some interesting Wisdom for everyone.

        {
            "content": "The final instalment in a film franchise often comes to define the franchise as a whole. The Return of the King cementedPeter Jackson's reputation as an extraordinary fantasy filmmaker who moved the goalposts for both cinematic technology and fantasy storytelling. Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness and Spider-Man 3 both saw the wheels come off, with Sam Raimi throwing everything he had at the screen to disguise the fact that he had run out of ideas.\n\nWith Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2, we already had a fair idea of where we were heading, if not by the end of Part 1, then by the ending of Half-Blood Prince. Coming in somewhere between the dizzying heights of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and Mike Newell and the disappointing lows of Chris Columbus, David Yates' instalments have had a lot going for them on a thematic or tonal level, but have also been hobbled by too much plot and a lack of weight in some of the main developments. Considering where the series began, the film is a triumph; considering where it could have ended up, the joy is much more muted.\n\nMuch like The Return of the King, much of Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is concerned with the characters' relationship with death. Even moreso than in the previous instalment, the characters find themselves in an endgame, where they are fighting against a seemingly inevitable outcome. Voldemort has never been as chillingly scary as Sauron, but in this film his desperation and panic over dying makes him more threatening. There are still times when Ralph Fiennes over-eggs it, but a lot of Voldemort's childlike fears of death and mortality are finally brought to the fore.\n\nHow precisely the film deals with death is quite a conflicted matter. As in the previous instalment, there is the seeming need for a lot of characters to be killed off simply as a means of ending their character arcs. Bellatrix Lestrange's demise is dealt with far too quickly to be satisfying, while more lovable characters like Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks don't get the screen time they deserve to make the appearance of their dead bodies carry meaning. Having invested so much in many of these characters, dispatching them so fleetingly - even in a war - is a bit of a kick in the teeth.\n\nTo put it bluntly, Deathly Hallows - Part 2 attempts to strike the same kind of balance that Jackson sought in The Return of the King, but is only partially successful in doing so. On the one hand, it acknowledges the need to show the scale of the war and the extent of the atrocities taking place; it's happy, in other words, to give us the Potter equivalent of the Battle of the Pellanor Fields. On the other hand, it seeks to be reflective and introspective, bringing the conflict down to the level of Harry's conscience and his final connection to Voldemort.\n\nGiven Yates' dodgy track record with action set pieces, it's no surprise that the Battle of Hogwarts' treatment of death is the weaker of the two approaches. The special effects are all fine - you won't find the same wretched over-abundance of CGI that you'd find in the Star Wars prequels. But while Jackson's battles had pacing and structure, with clearly defined yet unpredictable movements, the Battle for Hogwarts moves in fits and starts and isn't all that memorable. Yates tries to include as many of the little moments from the books as he can, but   he struggles to link them all together. If the Battle of the Pellanor Fields is like a Wagner opera - big, bold, brash and often breathtaking - this is more like a high school violin recital: still impressive in places, but timid by comparison.\n\nIn its more candidly introspective moments, however, the film takes flight and we find ourselves bonding with Harry a lot more than we would if he was solely in the heat of battle. Both the dream sequence in Kings Cross Station and the all-too brief sequence with the Resurrection Stone give the film the space it needs to breathe, reminding us of the emotional baggage which Harry carries and why he is fighting in the first place. It's to the credit of Yates and his colleagues that such scenes are allowed to take up so much time, when in a standalone or franchise-launching blockbuster, they would be lying on the cutting room floor.\n\nThe visual bleakness which Yates strove for in Part 1 is reinforced strongly here. The entire Kings Cross Station sequence borrows heavily from 2001: A Space Odyssey, using white light in a way that is intrusive but also comforting in the context of the action that surrounds it. The whole colour palette is more washed out, with the blues and blacks of the Hogwarts uniforms appearing dusty and battered even before the battle has started. This at least gives a semblance of tonal consistency, linking the battles and quiet moments together quite well.\n\nThe other big highlight of the film is the revelations regarding Snape. This is one aspect of the series in which what might be called 'the long tease' has worked: we have been held in suspense successfully for seven films, still unsure as to who Snape really is or where his loyalties lie. The revelations are powerful and moving in their own right, but Yates plays a clever trick by letting them unfold as memories. By using visual images, such as the flower unfolding in Lily's hand, he avoids it just being another exposition dump, and allows Alan Rickman the space he needs for Snape's death to matter.\n\nMuch of the film, of course, is still concerned with the hunt for the horcruxes, which give the first part a sense of structure and progress that it desperately needed. There's a very nice sequence right at the beginning where Hermione has to pretend to be Belatrix in order to enter her vault at Gringotts and take Helga Hufflepuff's cup (a suspected horcrux). Helena Bonham Carter demonstrates her acting chops in this scene, not just playing another version of the character but adopting Emma Watson's mannerisms and vocal tics perfectly. The scene is slightly spoiled by Harry's use of the imperius curse, but we can let that slide.\n\nUnlike the last film, however, the search for the horcruxes seems less essential as Part 2 rolls forward. This is partially deliberate, since the horcruxes in themselves are a plot device rather than an end point, but it's also an admission on the part of the filmmakers that people are only really interested in Harry and Voldemort's confrontation. The progress from one horcrux to another is still entertaining, particularly Harry's self-sacrifice to Voldemort in the woods. But being the last film in the series, we still grow impatient for things to get to the point.\n\nHaving finally reached that point, the film has some difficult decisions to make. The final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort has to do a lot of things to pass muster. It has to be visually impressive, giving casual fans who aren't encrossed in the mythology an indication of its significance. It has to capture the different attitudes of the characters towards death, contrasting Voldemort's self-hatred and fear with Harry's more philosophical approach. And it has to last long enough to make it seem like a big deal, but short enough to so that it doesn't drag, as happened with the 'climactic' lightsabre duel in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.\n\nGiven the expectations of both fans of the books and people who have followed the films, it's inevitable that there would be some degree of disappointment. But the final showdown comes up short in all three parts, albeit by not quite enough to completely derail it. It's less visually impressive than the duel at the end of Goblet of Fire, and a little less threatening in places. The subtext is there if you look for it, but Yates is often too absorbed in trying to make wands a threatening weapon to bring it out in the build-up. And while it is better directed than George Lucas' lightsabre battles, it's ultimately too static and straightforward, giving the impression that it goes on longer than it does.\n\nTo an extent, the final duel sums up the film, taking characters which we have followed and seen develop, and putting them in situations which are somewhat underwhelming in terms of how they use said characters. Before the oh-so-controversial epilogue - a whole lot of fuss about nothing - we get one last example of this, where Harry decides to destroy the Elder Wand. This is more decisive and logical than the book (in which he simply buries it), but the film misses out on the chance to explore this dilemma in more detail, just as Harry's relationship with power was explored in Half-Blood Prince. We're not expecting moral quanderies along the lines of Genesis of the Daleks or even The Empire Strikes Back, but even a little something would have been nice.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is a partially successful means to bring the curtain down on one of cinema's most enduring sagas. The cast are generally good as always, and David Yates deserves some credit for having so much introspection in amongst the bombast of battle. It's a flawed beast, like all the Potter films, letting us down in many of the key moments and being lazy when it really can't afford to do so. But as a means to say goodbye to a beloved character, it's not without merit.",

These categories include action, heroic battle sequences, adventure, teen romance, incredibly intense storytelling, outstanding special effects, and following the events from the book close enough to appeal to the hardcore fans. Despite the fact that the conclusion was somewhat predictable, it was nonetheless still fun the watch seeming as how attached we've gotten to the characters at this point, and will surely go down as one of the best movie finales of all time.",

Daniel Radcliffe's performance is arguably his best here. The battle sequence is done in a huge manner. In conclusion, it's the darkest film of the series that fits well as an epic finale.",

Nobody gets a satisfying send off. \n\nWhen Voldemort is defeated, it is very anticlimactic. He just seems to give up. Then, he blows away into the distance, like shredded wheat.\n\nThe kiss between Ron and Hermione came out of nowhere. The feelings which they both had for each other was barely addressed in the films. Harry and Ginny have the same problem. We are given no reason for their mutual affection. In the epilogue, when we see the that the two couples are married, those of us who have not read the books should feel most surprised.\n\nThe acting was spectacular. It is hard to imagine that these are the same people who pretended to be actors in \"Sorceror's Stone.\" \n\nDavid Yates shows off his superb skills as a director, and handles the final installment in the Harry Potter series quite well.\n\nOverall, it is a very satisfactory finale, despite feeling incomplete.",

The story has finally reached it's end in this visually impressive, amazingly well acted and magical movie. I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie. I'd say it was pretty flawless. Everything was concluded, no unanswered questions. Part 2 moved with a much faster pace than Part 1, but it wasn't rushed. It was perfect. Just as it should be with book to movie adaptations. I really don't understand how someone could not like Harry Potter, I really don't. It's an important piece of my childhood, both the books and the movies. I've seen every movie in the cinema, I've collected all books (and am currently reading them), I even own the Elder Wand. Seeing it all end was heartbreaking and emotional. And seeing the actors grow with the franchise was amazing. And how far the characters have gotten is truly brilliant. When I saw the very first movie, I did not see this coming at all. It's an amazing piece of literature, as well as filmmaking. It should be seen, and felt, by all. Don't you dare miss out on this series!",

The villainous Severus Snape plays no important role in the this movie as he was revealed as Dumbledore's killer at the end of The Half Blood Prince.\n\nThe epic finale in the classic HP film series tries so hard to overcome the excellence that made part 1 a truly great movie and fair addition to the franchise, but Part 2 looks away from that all and is presented with a rather clich\u00e9d script and  yet limited un-enjoyable battle sequences at the front yard of Hogwarts gate. The monstrous trolls, statues and enormous spiders that are present in the same sequences, to fight, doesn't even make the movie any much more exciting - and Voldemort's followers just fly around the corridors of Hogwarts and the grounds, and appear to be noticeably and impossibly spirited dark wizards 'if that makes sense' and yet it makes the feel of the movie and the set pieces seem so daft. \n\nDaniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are back as the three usual heroes, who are granted with the task to see that the last remaining horcruxes, which remain within Hogwarts enclosed territory, are found and destroyed. The dark tone of the movie shows the Producers were seeking their most unique and iconic sequel yet, a sequel that just yet had to be formed with dodgy set material and magical flashes from wooden wands from all angles of Hogwarts, wooden wands that just needed to be broken.",

This is one of the those ones that rises. I rewatched this series like five to six months ago, and this movie did move up. However, after rewatching this movie, its even better than before. It has all of the emotional and magically moments in the movie with dark themes that the later books gave us. It concludes what is the second best saga/trilogy of all time and really shows how David Yates was able to turn his shitty outing of Order of the Phoenix, into three great movies. This is my second favorite harry potter movie, right under Chamber of the secrets. This series is fantastic and really stuck to the books, while adding its own flair. Overall this movie is one of the best in the franchise and one of the best movie ever. 9.5/10\n\nFull list of best HP movies.\n1. HP and COS 9.6\n2. HP and DHP2 9.5\n3. HP and DHP1 8.9\n4.

            "content": "Rating-9/10\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the final part of the massively popular and wildly huge franchise that is Harry Potter. This is the most emotional but also most gripping of all the films and really gets to the point and just gets on with what has to be done. Not only is this a step up in terms of plot, but in acting too and the technical plus the score side get even better too to create a just brilliant film.\n\nWe see our young characters continuing their quest for Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes and the attempts to destroy them and henceforth also trying, to destroy him. The plot is just great, it is paced well and the film really gets into what it is doing straight away, it literally contains no boring part, or part left untouched or too hashed out, this is class all the way through. Daniel Radcliffe has emerged a fine young actor through this, and maybe even just through the two Deathly Hallow movies, you can see he is perfecting his style and with a cast like this franchise has behind him, it isn't so easy.\n\nDavid Yates returns as the director and he is well, what David Yates is always like in the Potter movies. All credit to him for not trying something wildly different but I still don't think his direction is spot on, he does however I feel do a well enough job. As for the writing I felt the same, not perfect but OK, of course when adapting a book it is not always so easy to find the right lines from the source material, or to make up your own, but Kloves does well in adaption. This is the most technically advanced Potter, and surely one of the biggest of 2011, the visual effects are staggering and you forget at times there being used, just beautiful work from that department.\n\nYet another fantastic thing about this is the score, now of course Harry Potter is known for it's scores and how wonderful they sound, but Alexandre Desplat goes even further. This man is a genius with movie music, he just knows exactly when to play the right tune, what the best thing to play is to not only make you feel pumped, but also tug at your heartstrings. If one thing from this movie can make you feel emotional, I will bet it is one scene with the glorious work of Alexandre Desplat.\n\nI felt throughout this should please fans of the book and also the fans of the movie series, yes OK the franchise did deviate from the book at times but all in all this is too good a movie to just criticise on that point. I felt if the directing and writing would have been great, this is the kind of movie we could have seen getting awards in that department. One more thing along those lines is that this is one movie that deserved awards, sure films like this don't usually get them but this has so much emotion, so much in epic proportions that this by the end deserves recognition, and not just from Harry Potter fans.\n\nI felt that overall this movie was just superb, a fitting end to a finely tuned family favourite and one that I personally hope generations to come can love and cherish. Don't judge Harry Potter as one film, judge it as the whole 8 movies in the series and when I do, all I see is how to make a franchise to perfection. This is by far the most emotional of them all as I said before and for good reason, so much happens and there is new things revealed, things from the past and of course new music from Desplat, yes take in the sights and sounds that Hogwarts have to offer, because this I say sadly, is the last time we will be going with our three friends.",

            "content": "As sad as it is to have to watch a Harry Potter movie and know that it is where the series has ended forever, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is simply a film I have come too far to miss. But it is always hard for me to watch because I know that this is where it all ends.\n\nBut luckily enough, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 proves to be an incredible film and arguably the finest of the series so far.\nThe only problem that stems from  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is that as it is the second half of a book, there is only so much material it can cover. And while it does it excellently from a dramatic and a visual standpoint with success even greater than Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, it is still obvious that there is not so far the film can go. \nBut nevertheless, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 captures all of the best elements of the series and the perfect dramatic elements to be the final film in the series.\nThe best elements of the Harry Potter films are the themes of adventure, friendship and darkness. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 uses all of them without fail. The story takes a slow step into its intro to give it time to settle its mood in and make use of its dramatic character elements, and fairly soon after it progresses into the adventure of its characters. Taking the best elements of the story, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 begins with an intense adventure which includes riding a dragon out of Gringott's Bank. Re-exploring the dragon mythology of the series for even just a brief period of time proves vastly entertaining and very thrilling, making the experience all the more exhilarating. So the scale of the film finds a good balance between adventure and character focused drama, the best balance of any of the films in the series so far. It paces itself very well so that the buildup to the climactic situations has an enhanced thrilling atmosphere which is brimming with the darkness within the themes that are explored in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. The journey that the film takes is a magnificent one which is effective on the large scale of adventure and battle, as well as on the small scale of all the characters facing trouble. I mean, the dramatic effect of the climactic battle scenes and the lead up to it is so effective that it sent chills straight down my spine. I was on edge for practically every second of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 once the things took off and the large scale of the darkness in the story was harnessed, so it is clearly the best experience I have had ever watching any of the Harry Potter films at any point in my life. As the series finale, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is an exceptional journey and an amazing spectacle of darkness. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the first film in the series to find the balance between complicated politics of the characters and the actual grand scale of the film, and in that area it is an excellent achievement, and thanks to director David Yates harnessing his best skills for storytelling, it is easy to forget that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is actually only half of a story because he tells it so well. \nAnd visually, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is just incredible.\nAs visual effects have evolved so far since Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 capitalises on that and uses them to maximum effect with flawless organica in the magic spells, the dragons and the action. They are also used well without the film being too reliant on them because the cast makes the visual magic of the film feel organic when they interact with it all. And against the backdrop of the magnificent scenery and production design, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a visual splendour in many many ways. It is a hard thing not to feel the magic of the film, and the visual experience of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is simply unforgettable thanks to its adventure and it's awesome action sequences which are perfectly high in quantity without the film lacking its small scale character drama.\nReally, director David Yates handles the material in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 so perfectly that it is hard to feel like it is half a story. He paces the film excellently and handles the script flawlessly so that it is a near perfect film and arguably the greatest of the entire Harry Potter series. As a fan and a critic, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has maximum approval from me and it is the most memorable film of the entire series for me simply because it ended the entire series on a really high note which ensured that its quality was magnificent.\nAnd one last time to give the perfect sendoff to a magnificent film series, the cast of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 deliver performances full of brute strength and bereft of any weakness whatsoever.\nDaniel Radcliffe's final performance in the titular role of Harry Potter ties everything together in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. As the story delves deeper into his mind  and further into his heroic attributes, we see Harry Potter come to terms with loss, betrayal and facing sacrifice. Everything piles down on Harry Potter in the last movie as the consequences of his actions come to fruition. Daniel Radcliffe pours his most intense strength into Harry Potter one last time and cements Harry Potter's legacy as one of the greatest magical heroes in the history of cinema. He stands tall with the strength of a warrior in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 an thanks to his tense and emotionally rich line delivery he makes a memorable impression. Daniel Radcliffe's final performance in the Harry Potter films is an impressive one which shows the dramatic strength that has grown in him as an actor over the course of all the films in the series.\nRupert Grint's last performance as Ron Weasley is an impressive one as well. While not neglecting his awkward demeanour which succeeds in achieving the same cringe comedy mood of the many previous films at times, he shows off a level of sophisticated heroism which has grown in Ron Weasley. Showing off his love for Hermione Granger, he stops mocking her or messing with her and treats her as a serious equal, if not a superior person. And in doing so you can see just how much he respects her and values her as a person, and that reveals everything that all 10 Harry Potter films had spent building up. A lot of Rupert Grint's best acting talents can be seen in how he engages with Emma Watson directly and indirectly, and they share a marvellous chemistry. Rupert Grint gives a practically flawless final performance as Ron Weasley, and is also establishes him as the hero he truly is.\nSharing the aforementioned marvellous chemistry with Rupert Grint is Emma Watson whose character's booksmarts take a back seat to her street smarts in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. Capitalising on her adventurous passion while revealing a certain impulsive nature, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 reveals a certain previously hidden side to Hermione Granger which neglects everything she has learned in favour of her natural sense of heroism, and it is occasionally laughable for the comedic effect of the film. Most of the time it is simply admirable, as is Emma Watson's immense acting skills. Fearless to stand up for what is right and fight for her beliefs, Emma Watson puts everything she has learned into the role that made her famous and makes herself a hell of a hero one more time. Emma Watson's sendoff to her character Hermione Granger is a terrific finale for her which emphasises her many acting talents and her skilful ability to engage with the cast on a mature level without skimping on the humourous childish elements rooted in Harry Potter.\nRalph Fiennes final role as Lord Voldemort is a memorable one. Through his skilful ability to sink deep into the character, Ralph Fiennes engages with the deepest and darkest parts of Lord Voldemort to give a sick and twisted final performance as the dark lord that instigated the war in the Harry Potter universe. Ralph Fiennes once again becomes pure evil for the role, and his dedication to the character is admirable and intimidating at the same time. With a fierce and antagonising chemistry that he shares with Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 becomes a true clash of the titans where Raplh Fiennes gives a powerful performance which if you look closely is a representation of Harry Potter if he was the complete opposite. Ralph Fiennes gives a great final performance in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.\nHelena Bonham Carter's take on Bellatrix Lestrange is once again perfectly sick and twisted. Although she doesn't get as much screen time as in the previous Harry Potter films, Helena Bonham Carter puts maximum effort and dedication into her performance in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which gives the character the kind of dedication that is required. The relentless sadism of Bellatrix Lestrange is easily harnessed by Helena Bonham Carter in with her natural wisdom as a great actress. Helena Bonham Carter's final performance in the Harry Potter films is terrific, and she drops none of her charisma for the role once again.\nIn none of the Harry Potter films up until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has Matthew Lewis given a more effective performance as Neville Longbottom. His kind of heroism has never been more emphasised in any of the Harry Potter films to date since he has largely been a bit of a doofus who has gradually become stronger as the film series has. And in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, he stands tall with a sense that he is no longer gonna take it from his enemies, fighting like a warrior with his wand and his sword as well as delivering a triumphant monologue to boost the spirit of his peers. Matthew Lewis hits a perfect level of strength in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 and gives an unforgettable performance which cements his status as one of the greatest heroes in the Harry Potter film series.\nTom Felton's final performance as Draco Malfoy is perfect. In the final film for the series, Tom Felton characterises Draco Malfoy as the human being he truly is, not the man forced from his father's shadow into a world of darkness, but simply a boy who fears it because he is human. And Tom Felton applies more humanity to the role than he has at any other point so far in his many performances as Draco Malfoy. You can see the fear within his eyes and the uncertainty can be heard in his voice. Frankly, Tom Felton gives it the best of all the skills he has learned over the course of the 10 years of Harry Potter films, and in the end he gives an exceptional effort.\nBonnie Wright's return to the role of Ginny Weasley doesn't really give her as much screen time, but within it she puts up a firm fight against the many enemies she and the many other Hogwarts students face and shares a strong chemistry with Daniel Radcliffe. She makes a genial presence in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 one more time, and it adds another talented name to the cast.\nAlthough Robbie Coltrane is given only a short period of time in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, he manages to give his performance the kind of firm grit and dark dramatic qualities needed for the part. While I was disappointed at what little screen time be received, Robbie Coltrane managed to ensure that nobody could be disappointed with the quality of his performance. Robbie Coltrane's final performance in the great role of Rubeus Hagrid is emotionally effective and dramatically strong.\nAnd while Alan Rickman also receives little time in the role of Severus Snape, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 contains a complicated sequence which emphasises the hidden nature of Severus Snape as well as revealing much about his background. It is an insightful moment, and during it we see Alan Rickman revealing the hidden heroic nature of the man in a series of vignettes which Alan Rickman acts out so finely that it seems as if he truly is facing several periods of time instead of having filmed a series of scenes closely together. Alan Rickman gives a perfect sendoff to the character Severus Snape which makes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 an even more compelling feature than it already was.\nJulie Walters has given great performances as Molly Weasley in all the Harry Potter films to date, but none of them have been more effective than in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 because she delivers what I would call the finest line in the series, when she stands up to Bellatrix Lestrange as she attempts to kill Ginny, and she hostile projects the words \"Not my daughter you bitch!\". Nobody in the Harry Potter series has said anything so badass with such fierce strength, and so when those words come up, it is both gripping and hilarious. Julie Walters' role is small, but unforgettable simply on the basis of that one line.\nMaggie Smith who was fighting breast cancer at the time of filming Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 makes an impressive supporting performance once again because of how she truly conveys that her character Minerva McGonagall feels a sense of fear of the forthcoming threat, and when she casts the spell that awakens the Hogwarts statues to fight for their school and gleefully exclaims \"I've always wanted to use that spell\" she proves her ability to make viewers laugh as well, even in the darkest of times. Maggie Smith is great to see up and active again in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.\nWarwick Davis' small appearance in his return to the role of Griphook is effective because of how he uncovers the dark element of greed that the Gringott's Bank goblin maintains, and of course his return to the role of Filius Flitwick is a good one too simply because when he stands shorter than all the surrounding people of Hogwarts casting his spells to fight the enemies off, his heroism is emphasised while some viewers may find it even a little bit funny. Either way, Warwick Davis' return to the world of Harry Potter is a great one.\nAnd lastly, the small returning performance of Evanna Lynch into the role of Luna Lovegood is terrific simply because she is a genial presence ago is delightful to have around. And the returning efforts of Michael Gambon, Jim Broadbent and especially Evanna Lynch prove to be a delightful foil for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.\n\nSo riding a perfect balance between magic, action, adventure and small scale character drama, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is an emotionally powerful, thrilling and exhilarating send off to a series with quality superior to any of the other films due to its direction, it's script, the magnificence of its visual qualities and the utmost dedication from its splendid cast.",

Not one character is shadowed, everyone gets to swish their wands with explosive results. This tremendous cast give performances so perfect you'd have to be pretty miserable to say otherwise, it's an astounding conclusion. The special effects are undoubtedly the finest of all eight movies, grand and awe inspiring from the enormous Dragon to the spectacular battles that features beams of light and debris enveloping the screen. I think this is the movie that all fans of Potter have been waiting for, and expecting. I wanted a jaw dropping conclusion and I got it, and then some. The ending scene \"19 years later\" honestly brought a tear to my eye, seeing the older Harry, Ron and Hermione wave off their kids as they join Hogwarts whilst that grand soundtrack plays out, it's a beautiful send off to ten years of wizarding magic that will never be forgotten.",

The story couldn't have been more awesome as it is, because it's so damn good, and the music is wonderful! The actors in this movie are fabulous as usual, and I never got bored at any time.\nAmong all the Harry Potter movies does this one stand out, because its so unique and it contains so much unique scenes that I haven't seen before.\n\nThe negative thing about this movie is that it might have been to dark scenes, because it was hard to see all the details in the movie. Another bad thing is that the when the movie was in the \"climax-stage\" it could have been more dramatic scenes, for example more awesome music, even thought the music is awesome in this movie. Another thing that they could have done is that they could have shown us more of Hogwarts in the future. The last thing that bother me is (SPOILER ALERT!) why Harry Potter destroyed the Elder Wand, he could have become the most powerful magician ever, but in the end I understand why he did it.\n\nThe ending must have been the best ending ever in all the harry potter movies, it was so touching and sad at the same time, and if I must say, I cried in the end credits!

I love it more than anything. Ok, there was some miner flaws, but unless your a really critical critic, there is no way not to watch it without becoming instantly addicted. \nI first became interested in Harry Potter at the young age of nine. Since then Harry Potter has become an everlasting obsession and addition to me. I can't get over how good everything is, and you'll never convince me they're not. I've watched all the films and read all the books more times then anyone can count. But I've never gotten the slightest bit bored or dissapionted by Harry Potter. From the main character, Daniel Radcliffe, all the way down to the tiny characters, everyone's acting earned an A++++++++++ --it was outstanding and very nearly perfect. I'm sad to see the series finished- but I think it should never be forgotten how great it is. Those of you who don't like it are completly mental, as they probably just focused on the small amount of tiny flaws instead of the epic movie as a whole. In short, I highly recommend this movie-as it's the best movie of all time!\n\nMy rating: 999,999,999,999,999 out of 100",

It brings together characters and elements from the earlier films, and gives each its time to shine. The action is well staged, and the visual effects are first-rate. There's a nice balance of action, humor and drama too.\n\n<< spoilers >>\n\nIt was so nice to see supporting characters have their moments too. Watching Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) take on Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) was great. As too was seeing Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) stand up to Lord Voldemort. I was also looking forward to seeing Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) get her comeuppance, and it was extra fun to watch Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) do the honors.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThe story line continues on from Hallows part one. But parts 1 and 2 require you to have watched or read the preceding stories in order to make any sense of the finale. In part 2, you can expect to see a lot more magical action.\n\nBest Format:\nThis is a great set of films. Watching them on the big screen is the best way to experience the magic. At home, a large HD screen is the way to go.\n\nBest moment for me: << spoiler alert! >>\n\nI found the scene where Professor Snape is attacked by Lord Voldemort and Nagini (his snake), really powerful. I loved how it was filmed too. We can barely see the outline of the huge snake through a dirty stained window as it violently and repeatedly lunges at Snape. The brutal power of Nagini's attacks evident by how much the window rattles after each deadly lunge.\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com",

However, the writers seemed to have ruthlessly complicated the plot more than necessary, and they seem to have written it in such a fashion that we get an obligatory, Disney-esque happy ending just to give the fans one last hoorah. If there's one thing to be praised, however, it's the special effects, and the fact that they at least set up a climactic final battle between Harry and Voldemort. Overall, while it has its flaws, it still manages to wrap up the saga as effectively as possible, having tied up all the loose ends.",

Along with the amazing action, this film is also a great dramatic piece.  The memory sequences of Snape are really great and I think we get Alan Rickman's best performance in the series.  Also, when Harry uses the Resurrection Stone to talk to his loved ones, it is a very touching moment, and Radcliffe really sells it.\n\n\"The Deathly Hallows Part 2\" is a fun, thrilling, visual spectacle.  Everything has been leading up to this and everything comes full-circle here.  This film is so great and should be seen by everyone.

The acting is phenominal, the battles are epic, and the movie is literally perfect in every way. It ties up all the loose ends in the franchise, leaving almost no questions to be asked. It is compelling, making you really root for the heroes to overcome Voldemort and his followers. It's a dark movie with some funny moments, and it takes the book and adapts it perfectly. Fans will love it, audiences will be satisfied, and everyone who sees it will not be able to help how impressive the movie is. All the characters are given full arcs, some rising above the others (Neville Longbottom really shinning as a true hero this time) and makes for one of the greatest movie's I have ever seen, and definitely makes for the best Harry Potter movie. You've grown up with these characters, and you'll be sad it's all over. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 gets 5/5 stars (A+).",

            "content": "Plot/Summary, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2, is the final adventure in the Harry Potter film series. The much-anticipated motion picture event is the second of two full-length parts. In the epic finale, the battle between the good and evil forces of the wizarding world escalates into an all-out war. The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is Harry Potter who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort. It all ends here.\nMy Review\nHarry Potter, the boy who lived... come to die.\nAfter 10 years it's finally over. I cried in this film so it deserves to be in my favorite movies of all time list. And so the most ambitious and expensive undertaking in film history draws to a close. 14 years on from the first book hitting UK shelves, a decade since the boy wizard made his debut on the silver screen, and over $6 billion in global box office takings later, the franchise finally reaches its conclusion with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2.\n\nMercifully, it's a suitably spectacular finale to this most towering of celluloid achievements; an emotionally draining journey into the heart of wizarding darkness, with battles fought, lives lost, and secrets uncovered that call into question everything that has gone before.\n\nThe film hits the ground running, picking up where Part 1 left off, with Harry, Ron and Hermione hunting down the Horcruxes -- items into which the Dark Lord Voldemort has embedded pieces of his soul -- and the three Deathly Hallows, which \"He Who Must Not Be Named\" believes will grant mastery over death.\n\nFlixster - Share Movies\n\nAs a fan, arriving at the opening night knowing that that would be the last Harry Potter movie I will ever see, instantly brought tears to my eyes; However, I couldn't help but to worry whether or not the movie I had been waiting for a life time would beat my expectations, and Im glad to say it did. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 and part 2 are 100 percent loyal to the books - or atleast as loyal as a movie can be - and that is why this movie is so good. This Harry Potter movie is by far the one with a more complex story, because after all it is where it all ends, the story reveals ultimate secrets and brings a final point to the story that changed a generation. . The movie starts right after part 1; Harry and his friends are still on the search for the final Horcruxes whilst Lord Voldemort is becoming more powerful, it is up to Harry and his friends to kill the dark lord before he destroys everything. The plot is highly convicing and it keeps everyone on the edge to see how it all will end. With all my heart I feel so satisfied with what Yates has done and the way he has done it. Another reason for why this movie is triumphant is due to the acting. The trio ( Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson ) Have not only grown in the screen but in our hearts, and so seeing how they have grown not only physically but in terms of acting is surely a big surprise. The trio gives a breath taking performance; each one with their unique style of acting makes the chemistry between us the audience and them even bigger. However it is not only the trio but every cast member that gives an optimum performance; Fiennes, Gambon, Bonham and ofcourse Rickman are all amazing actors that should be all time prize winners. However, its not the acting but the way the characters that we created in our minds from the book come to life. Over years the fans of Harry Potter are such as myself are being constantly disappointed by the Academy Awards when the prize for Visual Effects are not given to their righful owner. The movie is the biggest eye candy that I have yet seen . The creators are able to give a clear projection of what every fan has imagined, they make the magic come to life. Every scene is exhilarating and unique. Not only is the story amazing, but the action that follows it. Every scene speeds up our heart rates; the action brings emotions and thrills that make this a marvelous action movie. There are several scenes that should stay in history for its uniqueness. Overall there are sequences so powerful that make this an action packed fast paced movie, that isn't a millisecond boring, not for a fan and not for anyone. Finally, and of course the most emotional part is the farewell. As a member of the Harry Potter generation, Harry Potter has been beyond a book or a movie for me, its been a lifestyle. The Harry Potter world has given me guidance and given me strength when I needed it. Harry Potter will never end for me because it is eternal. Harry Potter couldn't have ended better, although it was a tear jerker, I can say that it gave the best period to a brilliant story .\n\nOverall the only way I can sum up this movie is with three words Best Movie Ever\n\nLord Voldemort: \"Only I can live... forever.\"",

And everything in here is just fantastic. As I follow the whole HP series, \"Deathly Hollows pt. 2\" is just enthralling  and bone chilling at the same time. A nail biting edge-of-your-sit experience. It was all magical, as Potter together with his close friends, Hermoine and Ron, are in for the adventure as they continue to search for the remaining Horcuxes and to destroy all of it.  I really like the story telling development. That also leads into some interesting scene of events which intrigues me a bit. Who knew that Serverus Snape is such an important character of the series. The fun begins in the 2nd half of the film, when the army of darkness collides with the army of Hogwarts. The visual effects of that epic battle scene is just fantastic. The part where the Hogwarts professors cast a huge ball of shield named \"Protego Maxima\".   As were professor Minerva McGonagall cast the guards of Hogwarts  named \"Piertotum Locomotor\". And that leads to an epic clash of huge Orcs against Dumbledor's armies. All of these epic proportions happening into an one epic war. The last battle between Harry Potter against Voldemort. I was like, \"that my friends, is what you called epic boss battle\". I love what they did on the fight scenes with great special effects which causes more epic proportions. If you're a HP fan or a movie goer who  just happen to watched all of these films. You would definitely enjoy it. From top to bottom, I was really into it. I can't even nod just to concentrate nor I was stunned on the whole movie. Amazing performances as usual, great visual effects as usual (much better this time though) and superb cinematography and production design. A movie of a magical tale, with  love and friendship. Mystery and dark magics. All on this one hell of a fantasy, that everybody loves. Superb job to all of the film makers who made this film possible in a very fantastic way, and to the creator herself, J.K Rowling, thank you ma'am for your brilliance. Thank you for making this fantasy masterpiece that we would never forget for a very long time. 5/5.",

David Yates, your Harmione is showing. That is not okay at all. But at least you made it up with Ron and Hermione kissing in Part 2.\n\nThe special effects is up-par with this one. Very realistic and breath-taking.\n\nThe performances from the cast delivered their swan song to the Harry Potter series. Of course, it seems like the cast were born to play their roles which is great as I will always remember them as their roles.\n\nThe pace is action-packed and fast in Part 2. I wished the battle between Harry and Voldemort took place in the Great Hall because I want to see everyone to cheer for Harry.\n\nLastly, while they did make some cuts, I am glad they did not skim the entire book and it used its two parts wisely.\n\nWhile it still didn't do justice to the book, the 2-part movie adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows will satisfy both the fans of the book and the non-fans, which they will additionally enjoy the character development, performances and the special effects.",

My review will be that of a fan, so bear that in mind.\n\nHarry Potter - The Deathly Hallows part II: The penultimate conclusion to the epic Harry Potter 7 book, 8 film extravaganza! And in my honest opinion by far and away the best film in the series.\n\nThis film is flawless in practically every regard. Let's go through them one by one just for the heck of it:\n\nStory: Obviously, this is based on the book, but in my opinion this is the only part of the movie franchise that surpasses the book in any way. Firstly, it is the darkest. Multiple key characters are dying left front and center throughout the film. Secondly, it is action packed. There is almost no fillers in this 2 and a half hour film. It's go go go all the way. Lastly, the flashback scene with Snape's memory sequence is the crowning achievement of the entire eight film epic and is the only part of the entire film series that I thought was in any way superior to the book.\nDirection: In a word \"Masterful\". It has a balance of just about everything. Tells the story as faithfully as can be expected, yet does not bore us at any point in time. The director must have been a true fan to put this much effort into the smallest details.\nActing: By far and away the best acting, except for maybe Deathly Hallows part 1, but if so just barely. Again the weakest link is Radcliffe, but even he does amicably. The rest of the cast is stunning.\nVFX / Sound: Dumbfoundingly great. Really setting the bar for high quality visual and audio effects while delivering a master-piece for the soundtrack. I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout.\n\nOverall, this movie is the reason to watch the other seven. Even if you don't like Harry Potter, sit through the others to get to this incredibly conclusion. If you are a Harry Potter fan, you have already watched this film, so meh...",

Radcliffe, Watson , Grint gave their best performances in this part too. Radcliffe is really good in intense scenes. Watson is charming. Grint is good in tense role.Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort is absolutely remarkable, he is terrifying, scary, vicious.

Dark theme really helped to create more tense drama. Special effects are good, Director used them intelligently. \r\n\r\nOverall, \"HP And Deathly hallows 2\" is an excellent film. Undoubtedly best 'Harry potter' film.",

Perhaps it didn't affect me that much all at back then. However, nearly 5 and 1/2 years later, I realize that's it so much more than an action film. Rewatching the film time and time again, I never fail to get a bit emotional when the opening title shows up in its customary 3D-like appearance. The somber music also helps get the nostalgia train going. However, once the customary Warner Bros logo and title card opening is over, the film picks up immediately where DH Part 1 left off. Harry, Ron and Hermione have just escaped from Malfoy Manor and are hiding out at Bill Weasley's (Ron's brother, for non-Potter fans) shell cottage. The trio then travels to the great wizarding bank Gringotts, where an impressive action sequence occurs involving a dragon and a magic door. This kicks off the second leg of their quest to find mysterious Horcruxes, objects crucial to defeating You-Know-Who. The battle between good and evil at Hogwarst is visually stunning and emotionally powerful, with beloved characters either perishing or having their own hero moments. I'll stay\ntight-lipped about the ending of the film for those who haven't seen it, but I will say that it's the perfect sendoff to the magical franchise that has captured the hearts of millions over the last decade\nand a half.",

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a mixed bag for me.  On one hand, the film is expertly made, with some amazing cinematography and special effects.  The  acting is superb and well rounded.  Then, on the other hand, it's pretty long.  The source material isn't that good, and it takes itself way too seriously.  My sister is a huge fan of HP and she loved every minute of this film.  Me, going as a non HP fan, didn't enjoy it as much.\r\n\r\nHP 7 is a film strictly for fans.  I felt excluded from all the inside jokes, meaning, etc.  Also, the humor in this film was non existent.  I mean sure, there were suppose to be hilarious moments (I think).  But I didn't laugh.  I feel a film about people aiming sticks at each other should have much more comedic moments.  I blame the source material for doing nothing fun.  That's the film's problem:  It wasn't fun.  The film focused on all the technical aspects and less on plot.  Basically, Voldemort wages war with Hogwarts.  The film had a couple of sub plots that weren't really interesting to me.  Also, the length is too much.  2 hours 11 minutes is pretty long, but it felt more along 2hr 45min, to me.  I guess that whole \"Harry dying\" scene was quite boring.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a mixed bag.  It has wonderful scenery, acting, and cinematography.  However, it is let down by a less than inspired script and the fact that they're fighting with sticks.  My final score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is *drum roll* 4.5/10",

There's cool twists and turns in the story which change your perception of the overarching narrative and the franchise as a whole. There are some problems with the film with some character deaths being overlooked and just glanced over whilst some parts of the film do feel like they could've gotten more focus to make the story more compelling.

Everything in the series builds up to one climactic battle between good and evil, and it does not disappoint. It all moves very fast and you will need to be on your toes to catch it all. It also does a good job tying up all of the loose ends in a gratifying manner. Over the last decade this talented cast did such a great job of breathing life into the wonderful characters.

I didn't know how Harry Poter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 would hold up, being the very last in such a long and exciting franchise that has had both ups and downs.  But from the first frame...my god...I still feel amazed two years later.  The franchise and all it stood for ended here and in just the way that it was meant to.  One of my favorite films of all time, Deathly Hallows Part 2 is undoubtedly the greatest film in the series, the best film of that year, and one of the best finales to a film series ever.  I swear, other adults in the theater were crying, and that day was the second and last of only two times I actually shed a tear for a film.  It is a finale of epic proportions, amazing all and being a shock with just how brutal it could feel at times.  At last the acting of the main characters has become outstanding, the directing great, the effects fantastic, the story a near-perfect conclusion...this was the rightful Best Picture winner of the franchise and deserves that.  As I left the theater and went home to try and get SOME sleep, I realized that in the end...Harry Potter was a huge part of my childhood, something I'll cherish forever and, even though it had many ups and downs, it was there for a long part of my life.\n\nSo that concludes my entire morning of reviewing the eight films of the Harry Potter franchise and...wow.  The series has definitely aged over time, especially the first two films, but it was still a great series of books and movies in the end.  For those of you out there who have had your lives affected as greatly as mine by this series, you are very lucky people.\n\nAlright before I sign off I do want to point something out about the final book that DOES seem a little dumb.  For months before it came out in 2007, there was so much hype about whether or not J.K. Rowling would kill off Harry.  And you know, to tell the truth, looking back on that...how could she get away with that? As a writer she probably wouldn't risk all the hate mail and the very thought probably only crossed her mind to use to make us (the fans) feel like there's some suspense.  But as ridiculous as that hype was, at least it worked.\n\nSo that's my Harry Potter Review Morning, for those of you who read this, I hope you enjoyed it, feel free to share your opinions on the films by commenting on the respective review and I'll get to you as soon as possible.

            "content": "Well, David Yates has once again disappointed me.  Director of the previous 3 Harry Potter movies (Order of the Phoenix, The Half-Blood Prince, and the Deathly Hallows Part 1) as well as this final chapter, Yates has left me unsatisfied every time.  It's not that his work on the Potter films have been especially bad (with the exception being Deathly Hallows Part 1), but they've felt weak when compared to the first four films.  So while I like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, it's so disappointing when one considers that this was a finale that the franchise has been building up to for over 10 years.  I can only imagine how disappointed I would've been had I not blown through the series in a matter of weeks.\r\n\r\nIn this final chapter, Harry and his friends must destroy the final Horocruxes, though things get tricky when Voldemort and his forces begin to attack Hogwarts.\r\n\r\nI was never truly enchanted during this film.  Entertained?  Yes- at least most of the time.  But Deathly Hallows Part 2 never does reach the dramatic heights it's trying to achieve.  It never feels like anything important or fantastic.  The whole film just feels sort of slight.  This is not a bad film, but as the conclusion to one of the most influential franchises of all time, I have to say, I was expecting more.\r\n\r\nOf course, one could now say that my enjoyment of the film was perhaps affected by my expectations.  And yet, I believe the film would still be at fault.  Such a film as this should be made to blow away even the highest expectations, and never did this film come close to doing so.\r\n\r\nThe characters are still lovable, but we only see a little bit of most of them.  Neville gets a decent role in this film, though his entrance near the beginning of the film would've been much more meaningful and delightful had his one-line role in the previous film been replaced with a different wizard.\r\n\r\nThe characters have typically been the best part of the franchise- and I may get a lot of hate for this- but the story itself isn't all that interesting to me.  It's intriguing, to be sure, but so much of the screen time in this film- and definitely the previous one- is devoted to exposition and story, that we don't really get to spend enough time with the characters we love (other than the three main characters anyway, but they don't have enough depth to be as effective on their own).\r\n\r\nThe visual effects are excellent, and probably the best of the series.  Indeed, the visuals are a treat, and at last we have a version of the invisibility cloak that doesn't look like a cheap green-screen effect!\r\n\r\nActing is solid on all sides of the spectrum.  I don't have anything to say here that I haven't already said in previous reviews of the Potter films.\r\n\r\nThe score, by Alexandre Desplat, is once again disappointing, but it's a massive improvement on the last two scores of the film.  I'm willing to believe that the best parts of this score are better represented on the album, but judging purely by what I heard in the film, there wasn't much that stuck in my mind.  Still, the most pronounced use of the now classic \"Hedwig Theme\" since the Goblet of Fire is in this film, and that's worth commending.\r\n\r\nFor 2 hours, I was mostly entertained.  And while that's an impressive feat in itself, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that this should've been better.  There's nothing here that's truly awful, or even bad I suppose, but there's little here that leaves an impression like the first four Potter films did.  As a franchise conclusion, this does what it needs to do.  But it should've done more.",

I have to say I am one of the fans with all books, dvds, dvd collection, posters, wands and a few more things slightly bordering on obsessed. Even though having read the final book a hundred times before the final part of the film came out I was found in the cinema crying at the deaths and on the edge of my seat through the final few scenes the same way I was whilst reading the books. Reaching the abrupt end to some of the most famous film characters David Yates tied the loose ends of the characters lives perfectly. Even though most of the actors and actresses have moved on to other films or plays I, along with a billion other people, will always remember them as the three children always getting into trouble at school whether they were discovering a three headed dog, battling dementors or eventually destroying the school as well as Voldemort. Harry Potter will be one of these films which I show to my children one day and I know they will be as captivated as I still am. \"Deathly Hallows part 2\" ended the era of epic magic but I know there is still some people out there, like me, that still remember watching the first scene as harry was placed at the front door with the scar on his forehead like it was only yesterday.",

It's difficult to explain without sounding like a book purest, but a hell of a lot development of characters was lost in simply rushing from point to point, it took less than a half hour to go from Shell Cottage to getting to Hogwarts, those missing scenes-while not needed to keep the story rolling along-are needed to explain things later on, and I'd ask why everything in the movie seemed to want to rush to the \"epic\" fight between the Death Eaters and the Hogwarts faithful.\r\nIf this had been a single movie, I think it would have been better, the flow would have worked far smoother.\r\nThe acting is-for the main cast, well done, there were some horrible underwhelming performances, notably the lack of anything coming from Alan Rickman's Snape and-quite possibly the worst moment when I actually laughed out loud while in the cinema-the first confrontation between Voldemort and Harry, Ralph Fiennes went so over the top with his 'Avada Kedavra', it just seemed cartoonish and silly-especially when placed against the far more powerful and commanding quiet version from the book.\r\nIt's not a terrible movie, but the last three quarter of an hour were majorly overhyped and played too flashy for the meaning of the battle, to be honest I think if they'd lost the musical swelling and flashy explosion sounds and done it silent or a creepy queitness to everything I think it would have been done better.",

What I love about the film is the Nazi Germany atmosphere it creates, because of this you actually get the feeling our hero's are in danger. Ralph Fiennes returns as 'You-know-who' and is fantastic as usual, Alan Rickman brings the 'Severus Snape' full circle in a satisfying conclusion to his character. The soundtrack is better than ever before and is perfectly placed throughout and most of the characters you've come to love get at least one defining moment.\nThe movie's not perfect through, characters that played a big role in previous titles are killed off screen, the main trio are decent actors at best, the final duel between 'Harry' and 'You-know-who' is unsatisfying and leaves you asking, is that it? and the ending is rushed and awkward. \nThat said 'The Deathly Hallows part II' is a great film and a satisfying finale to this great saga.",

What surprised me a lot was the emotional impact that the film had on me. Many of the scenes had quite convincing settings and emotional depth that is unprecedented in the Potter series. The storytelling was rather slick and the visuals are simply stunning. The special effects have by far been one of the best, with the exception of the Half-Blood Prince possibly. Overall, the finale of the series was done as good as it could have been done. I'm rather happy that they decided to split the last book into two films, since it allowed for a fuller, more complex understanding and presentation of the story in the film.

Yes there were continuity issues. However what was presented on screen was a total and cmplete success.\nThe visuals, the story, the acting were all top notch. Anyone who still considers this a kids franchise is sadly mistaken. This movie was as dark as could be and no punches were pulled when it came to some of the big reveals. Alan Rickman was great finally getting some screen time again, Danielle Radcliffe deserves a nod for his performance as well. This was as physical and emotional performance that has not been seen too often even by the best of actors, and he nailed it. Ralph Fiennes steals the show with his perormances as he shows Voldemort as someone coming to terms with his weaknesses and that this grand scheme of his might not be playing out as well as he thought. I just had a great time watching this film.\nAdditionally, I did see this in IMAX 3D, the first time I have had this experience. Wow. I will support 3D flms if they are only released in this format. The effects were not blatantly in your face but only added to what was happening on screen, and sitting down low enough so that the screen took up my entire line of sight really helped the effects seem to pull you into the movie. Admittedly a few times people walked by to leave the theater and it startled me as I was so into what was happening on screen. So big thumbs up to the best use of 3D I hve seen so far.",

I can take it that you have grown up with these movies as I have, and I'm sure that you can remember the first time you saw Platform 9 and 3/4, or when you saw Harry's first Quidditch game, or how frightened you must have been when you first saw HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED (Voldemort). I know of some people who refuse to see the movie series that they have grown up with disappear, so they refuse to see the final film. I just want all of you reader's to know that I'm not just speaking for this film as a fan because I am a fan, but I want to speak to you as a critic. I want all of you to know that this film is truly a masterpiece that deserves a lot of recognition. It is the best film in the series, and I'm not just saying that, I love all of the films but this one is particularly grabbing. This film takes off where the last one left off, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) must break into Gringotts to retrieve a Horcrux, one of the remaining pieces of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul. The film then escalates into the final battle for Hogwarts, friends die and characters are tested. but when it comes down to it the film is so breathtakingly beautiful on all levels, that we wonder how everything will turn out. Most of the people will whine and cry that the ending battle is different from the one in the book but I say that it is truly better than the book. The Resurrection Stone scene is a scene that started to leave me in tears, along with the epilogue which will shake any hardcore Harry potter fan. What I have to give praise for is for Alan Rickman who shows a side of Snape that we read in the book but portrayed it better than what was written in the book without emasculating Snape's character, He portrays it with such a breath taking elegance that it will leave you in tears. Alan Rickman BETTER get an Oscar Nomination for this performance. And I will also say that the film BETTER get a Best Picture nomination. This film will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you scared, and it will make you watch in amazement, and in the end it will make you reflect on all the times that you have shared in the life of a boy named Harry Potter. **** out of **** Beautiful.",

As one might expect from a grand finale, the series reaches its ultimate climax -- the long-awaited duel between Harry Potter and Voldemort -- and characters have dramatic moments to indicate how they have grown as people. Progressing through all of the films, I sometimes questioned the charisma of Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, but they remained dedicated to their characters. In their performances, I see that they are aware of how so young they are for such an apocalyptic situation, but they try to take charge of certain fronts as best as they humanly can. The magic is as dazzling as always, especially with one spell, a fire dragon, terrifying me for every person in the scene. Truthfully, I postponed watching this for so long that I don't even care about writing my usually long and detailed review. It's a good film, one of the best of the series. I might be too tired of Harry Potter to like the finale, or even the series as a whole, with high enthusiasm. What a very long journey, it has been.",

            "content": "\"Harry Potter. The boy who lived. Come to doe.\"\r\n\r\nEvery generation has a film that defines their childhood. For my grandparents, it was films like Gone with the Wind and The Ten Commandments. For my parents, films like Jaws, Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark defined their childhood years. But in my generation, besides The Avengers and The Dark Knight, the film that really defines my childhood is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, the final chapter in an eight-film, ten-year franchise. And boy, did they save the best for last.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is down to the final Horcruxes in his quest do destroy Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) immortality. His quest leads him, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) through an exciting break-in at Gringotts Bank and then return to Hogwarts to lead the final battle of Voldemort's terror.\r\n\r\nMany return to be in this epic finale, including Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Michael Gambon as Dumblebore (in flashback scenes), Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Jason Isaccs as Draco's father, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, John Hurt as Ollivander, Warwick Davis as the small professor Flitwick and the sneaky goblin Griphook, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Julie Walters as Mrs. Weasley, and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood.\r\n\r\nIn most film franchises, sequels tend to run out of steam by the time they get to the third or fourth film, but each Harry Potter film has entertained me each time. Look at my ratings for the previous films: Sorcerer's Stone-70%, Chamber of Secrets-90%, Prisoner of Azkaban-100%, Goblet of Fire-90%, Order of the Phoenix-100%, Half-Blood Prince-80%, and Deathly Hallows Part 1-100%. Other than the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there hasn't been a rotten film in the franchise in recent years, and with Deathly Hallows Part 2, that fresh streak ends on a super high note.\r\n\r\nOh my, where to begin? Well, first off, the action sequences are thrilling and spectacularly filmed. The battle sequences are only put in the background, focusing on Harry's journey instead, but what is shown is some of the most amazing action sequences put on film in recent years. The PG-13 rating is definitely earned here, with higher death tolls, insane wand flickerings, and loads and loads of visual wonder. The said Gringotts raid that opens the film delights as well, even if the Hogwarts battle drown it out. \r\n\r\nThe visuals, hands down, are the best in the franchise. That dragon is the most realistic dragon I've seen yet on film (Smaug will be hard to top), all the statues and giants in battle amaze, and the climatic showdown between Harry and Voldemort? The craziest, intense climax both visually and emotionally.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of emotionally, the emotional factor raises super high in this film. Harry risks it all to protect himself and his friends in the crumbled Hogwarts, and it really shines on the camera. The best scene in the entire film, believe it or not, is not an action sequence. For me, it would be a flashback sequence revealing the backstory of Snape's past. Without any spoilers, one of the most emotional and phenomenal moments I've witnessed, even with many melodramas out there, this is drama gold right here.\r\n\r\nSome have complained over the lack of character development in this one. Well, this is the eight film for crying out loud! We already know who Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Voldemort are, we know their personalities already! Why do they have to be redeveloped again? Generally in film, I want character development, but since I know the characters already, the heavy action which dominates roughly 95% of the picture suited me fine, and I was wowed. \r\n\r\nThe acting, once again, delivers. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint shines for the last time and bid a strong farewell that could make anyone weep. Watson generally stole the show before, but in this film, the best of the three was easily Radcliffe, due to his emotional complexity and his eagerness to sacrifice himself to protect his friends. Ralph Fiennes is at his creepiest as You-Know-Who, and is also his most intimidating. Helena Bonham Carter thrills as Bellatrix, and has a good imitation of Watson in one scene that you'd think Watson was doing the scene. But Alan Rickman put out the best acting performance here as Snape, especially in the flashback scenes. I've already mentioned it before, it's an emotional scene. You might cry. Enjoy it.\r\n\r\nEach character gets to shine their best in this film. For Harry, it's the final showdown. For Ron and Hermione, an epic kiss. For McGonagall. to whoop on Snape. For Mrs. Weasley, to whoop on Bellatrix. For Luna, to help out Harry. For Neville, to finally show his braveness in battle. And for Snape, to show his true self that could shock people. \r\n\r\nAlexandre Desplat returns to score the finale, and it's phenomenal. He even broght back some John Williams themes for this one, and it sums up the finale perfectly. Some of his new themes introduced here are chilling, especially one focused on Lily, Harry's mom. Out of all the scores in the franchise, Desplat's score here would make my Top 2, along with Williams score for Prisoner of Azkaban.\r\n\r\nIt may have taken ten long, hard years to make, but the wait paid off, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a visual wonder, an epic finale, and an emotional, wonderful conclusion to one of the most memorable franchises in recent years. Out of all the directors who made a Potter film, it's David Yates, who made this and the previous three, who stood out the most. This is the best Potter film and one of the best final chapters out there, along with Return of the Jedi (well, not anymore), The Dark Knight Rises, and Return of the King. If you haven't watched a Potter film yet, don't start here. Start with the beginning, then pick up, and you'll see how truly wonderful this film is.",

BY FAR the darkest film of the franchise, it's also the saddest and has the least of the wizarding world magic the rest of the Harry Potter films have but in this case, it was necessary.  Honestly, I would say this is my favorite fantasy franchise just because of how this film concluded everything so perfectly (even the many twists and reveals were quite handsomely written and directed).   Please, if you consider yourself a film fan/fantasy fan, you must view all 8 films of this franchise because it really is a remarkable adventure that will probably steal your heart and maybe, if your lucky, even your soul",

            "content": "There is a tiny moment deep into Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2  that passes quickly but stands for a lot.  Harry Potter, now grown to manhood and sporting stubble, is visited by the ghostly apparition of his avuncular former mentor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) who looks at his pupil with caring eyes and addresses him: \"Harry, you wonderful boy . . . you brave, brave  man.\"   Man  is the key word.  In ten years, ever since we first met Harry in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, we saw a wonderful, fresh-faced little boy become a man of wisdom, of strength, of caution, of maturity and of leadership.  This is a character we've grown up with over ten years and now we are watching him go on to his destiny and onward to an uncertain future.\n\nWhat is most refreshing about this closing chapter is that, after seven previous adventures, it is refreshing to have a hero whose mind, heart and soul are conditioned by the lessons he has learned, and not by the body count at this feet.  Death is a major factor in this concluding episode of the worldwide hit, there are many deaths, but the question looming over this chapter is whether Harry will become one of them.  There isn't a conclusive answer to that question because the ending that Rowling came up with (assuming you haven't read the book) is both baffling and fascinating at the same time.  That, in essence, has been the continuing factor of this series all along and part of the reason that we have kept coming back.  Rowling gift is that she has such a surprising sense of imagination that we don't know what she will come up with next.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2  picks up immediately where it's predecessor left off, with Harry (Daniel Radcliff) and pals Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) seeking objects known as Horcruxes, ordinary objects that contains torn off pieces of the soul of the evil snake-faced Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).  By this point (forgive me if my count is off) there are four that remain and Harry discovers that one of them is locked away somewhere at Hogwarts school, which was absent in the last film but occupies 90% of this one.  As Harry returns, students and teachers at Hogwarts batten down the hatches for a massive battle with Voldemort and his minions.\n\nWhat is special about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2  is that it is more than just a door-closer, more than just a vessel to tie up loose ends.  There is a lot at stake here, not the least of which is the fact that Harry must take the final steps of his journey alone.  What is interesting here is that, whereas the previous installment pushed aside most of the supporting cast, this one brings them all onstage for the final showdown - everyone gets their little moment.  Yet, the story still remains focused squarely on Harry.  This is his big moment and we see that that overly protected little tyke of 10 years ago is now a man battling the most evil being in the land single-handedly.  That battle would be nothing without a performance we can believe in and Daniel Radcliff, who has seemed distant from the material in some of the previous movies (at his worst he seemed to simply be going through the motions), finds an intense foothold on the character that lends it gravity and weight.\n\nThe movie doesn't have the overriding sense of dread that Part 1  did (that film was much better), it replaces quiet atmosphere with breathless action scenes.  In fact, after Harry returns to Hogwarts, the movie is one action scene after another.  That's both a blessing and a curse.  There are action scenes here are hit home with striking originality, such as an early scene in which Harry and friends must break into the goblin-run Gringott's Bank to steal an object from the vault of witchy-woman Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham-Carter).  I like the action scenes in these movies because they always have a spark of originality, but if there is a weakness in this last chapter, it is the feeling that the movie is rushing things.  We get to the final moments with Voldemort rather quickly, a little too  quickly I think.  This is the shortest film in the series and there is a lot of information to be imparted to the audience including the legacy of Harry's parents, the truth about Professor Snape, the mysterious machinations behind the death of Dumbledore and the steps that Harry must take to fulfill his destiny.  It is a lot to take in and I think the pacing of the previous installment was better at allowing us to get involved rather then join the film on visceral level.\n\nWhat the movie does  have is a lot of great technical expertise.  The new additions to the score by Alexandre Desplat adds a funerary tone to the proceedings.  They don't just tone with ominous dread but creep under certain scenes and give them gravity and weight and emotion, most especially in the scenes where the full story of Professor Severus Snape finally surfaces.  The set designs by Stuart Craig are mostly made up of rubble and debris, but as Hogwarts crumbles around hero and villain, we are reminded that Hogwarts is one of those great movies spaces that occupies our collective memories as vividly as The Death Star or Tara, Gotham City or The Bates Motel or The Emerald City.  It isn't just a set, it is a place that comfortably occupies our imaginations.  We care  about the things that go on there.\n\nHarry Potter is a series that - both on screen and on the page - was never content to remain as it was in the beginning.  Like Harry, this is a series that has grown and matured.  Deathly Hallows Part 2  is violent but not bloody and scary but not traumatizing.  It is a polar contrast to the innocence of Sorcerer's Stone with its talking portraits and Quidditch matches (just to hammer that point home, the Quidditch field itself meets a fiery end).\n\nIt was a wise decision to split this concluding chapter into two parts.  The first part made good use of ominous silences and the spaces between the action where we could get inside Harry's feelings of dread.  This second part is just the opposite, there are few moments of quiet introspection (save for that moment with Dumbledore) and, in fact, this is one long action scene.  Is it the perfect sendoff?  It isn't as spectacular as it could have been, but I must say that I was surprised at how much this movie was able to cover in two hours and ten minutes.  When we get to the concluding scenes, it feels like a fitting farewell.  The door closes on one of the most original and creative enterprises that any author has ever put to paper.  There's a feeling of saying goodbye but an even greater feeling of what is to come.",

Still to me there was something missing that I can't put my finger on, and for the most part I think it had to do with pacing. Yes I read the book so I know what was changed a bit and what was added and what was not used and for a movie that is fine that they streamline it. I guess on some of the back-stories of people like Snape and Dumbledore needed to be fleshed out even more, especially the latter in part 1.  I also didn't like how they handled some main plot points like the defeat of Voldemort and the fate of the Elder Wand. Also, something I never liked from the book that they used was the 19 years later epilogue. I would rather in both book and movie it wrapped in present time and with all the other minor characters that get ignored in the current version. It's like one minute they have won then its no fanfare and 19 years later. Still I was a fan of the stories so I'm sure I'll get this on Blu-ray, which is worth it just for the scenes with Alan Rickman, although I want to wait for the Ultimate parts 1 and 2 combined disc (which they better make).

            "content": "All good things must come to and end, even Harry Potter. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, the eighth and final film in the enormously successful series, lives up the promise of its immediate predecessor, Deathly Hallows: Part 1, and provides the series and its fans with the send-off they deserve. It's a briskly paced film full of excitement. Every actor in the massive ensemble is at his or her best, and the sense of closure brings a great deal of emotion to the table. It's quite an achievement, one of the best in the series, the best film of the summer, and totally deserving of the record-breaking box office and overwhelming praise it has received.\n\nAfter burying the loyal house elf Dobby at the end of the last film, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) decides he must continuing pursuing the hidden horcruxes, pieces of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul, in order to finally defeat his enemy. This quest takes he, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson), to Gringotts, the wizarding bank, and Hogwarts. Once there, he reconnects with this old teachers and friends for one final stand against the forces of evil on their doorstep. But the end to this tale has already been written, and to see it through, Harry is going to have to make one last sacrifice.\n\nThe film disposes completely of exposition; If you haven't seen the previous seven films, you might as well sit this one out. But for those of you who've taken in every word on every page of J.K. Rowling's novels, you'll find yourself immediately swept up in Harry's quest. The lack of a true beginning to this film means we get right into the action extremely quickly, and while that might seem like a negative, it ultimately contributes to the film's biggest asset-its breakneck pace.\n\nI'm not sure I've ever felt a two-plus hour film go by so quickly. It's strange because the film only covers about a third of Rowling's book, and there are a handful of scenes that feel a bit overextended. In fact, much of the finale is plotless. It's just a big battle with a bunch of different characters and whole lot of chaos. It shouldn't work as well as it does, but I've got no complaints.\n\nThe action is both good and bad. The Gringotts break-in was tremendous. The fiery escape from the Room of Requirement was great. And the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort was incredibly intense. But most of the other battles-both wizard duels and fights with other magical creatures-seemed generic. The only duel in the series that I remember fondly was between Dumbledore and Voldemort in Order of the Phoenix. I guess they just didn't translate too well from the page to the screen.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe gave his best performance of the series in Order of the Phoenix, but he's excellent here, as well. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have less to do than in the other films, but they're both solid. Alan Rickman gives the film's best performance as Snape. The conclusion to his story is tragic, and Rickman proves himself more than capable of pulling of the difficult transformation his character must undergo.\n\nThe Harry Potter series has been a constant over the past ten years, something we could consistently rely on, and now that it's done, I know I'll miss it. With eight films in the can, most of them quite good, and billions and billions of dollars worldwide, we might never see anything like this again. The hardest thing for any series to do, however, is to end on a high note. Harry Potter achieves that with this film. Director David Yates, screenwriter Steve Kloves, and the rest of the team behind this film and the seven others should be proud of everything they've accomplished. They had a tough task on hand and were under a great deal of pressure, but for the most part, they did a magical job.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2-review/",

Good special effects throughout.  I'll continue to stand by my thoughs that this whole series should have been 2-3 movies tops with a total focus on harry vs voldemort with all the interesting/relevant back story of snape and dumbledor, ect, it could have been really good i think.",

Like I said In my review for Harry Potter 7- Part 1, this movie has already taken the ballsy direction in killing the beloved and important characters. The fight between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange was epicly hilarious and when Harry Potter causes a fake death and Voldemort and the Death Eaters are laughing at the screen, it just had me cracking up until Neville comes in to give in a speech and maybe even help save the day.

The series excelled and progressed each showing and delivered action, emotion, storytelling and superb acting.  The budget for each film grew and so did expectation, and for the most part, each movie delivered.  Ultimately, part 2 stood out to me for the emotion between Harry and every character we've journeyed with along the way.  It wouldn't surprise me to see some people shed tears.  It felt like many of the actors who portrayed supporting characters (Alan Rickman or Ralph Fiennes in particular) really get to shine in the final chapter.  Kudos to Daniel, Emma, and Rupert for sticking through eight movies in this series from kids to adults.  There is nothing that irks me more than movie series that recast because certain actors or situations prevent them from returning.  Yes they'll forever be remembered as these characters until the next generation sees them older and in different films, but kudos.  I didn't give any HP film a full five star rating.   I am a firm believer of the film is never as good as the book, but that's because no one can ever recreate what you see in your head.  For the DH part 2, we are flooded with magic and wizardry and special effects more than any other film, but if I'm being honest, the final battle did not live up to expectations the other seven films had been brooding toward.  Don't let this keep you from watching.  HP deserves to be a series passed down to the next generation for years to come.",

To both book and movie fans of the series...(Don't believe me look at some pictures of people at the midnight) I describe the movie as an emotional, epic, and thrilling installment to the most magical series in history... The movie is a roller-coaster ride! Just make sure to bring tissues. (There were chicks crying in the theater...) I am truly happy with the film in its entirety. Sure movies based off books, especially the Potter series do always make changes to the story, but for the epic conclusion that was given to us why bother!?! It may be a Harry Potter movie but Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have shown some extraordinary talent in the Deathly Hallows films! The shining star is this chapter is Alan Rickman. Throughout the years he truly made this character, but to see the true side of his mysterious character, portrayed in the best possible way nearly brought a tear to my eye. Alexandre Desplat, whom scored the films music in Part 1 returned to add a whole extra level of emotion into Part 2! From the ominous opening to the gigantic battle at Hogwarts. David Yates was feared to not do the Deathly Hallows films justice due to how bad true Harry Potter fans (Myself included) thought Half Blood Prince was nowhere near what it should have been. And for Half Blood Prince being the opening to the final films we were skeptical, but Yates....YOU\"R THE MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that's the Potter nerd in me......But back to professionalism. It is very sad to be seeing this cast and world come to a close after being with it since the beginning. No fan excluded, we will sincerely miss waiting every few months for a trailer to the next Harry Potter film! I guess when one door closes, another opens. And we will be following the cast throughout their careers to see them create even more incredible characters. Harry Potter, Farewell......It's been one hell of a run.....",

David Yates, even though doubted at times in the middle of the series, crafted a brilliant and masterful conclusion to the whole Harry Potter franchise. As I grew up with this film from the very beginning, it was as if I was closing a chapter of my life. This is a series that carefully meandered its way both through the glorious and triumphant times of Harry Potter while at the same time not leaving his greatest defeats and heartwrenching moments forgotten.\r\n\r\nDaniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint all give breathtaking performances in the conclusion, but what really stood out for me was the talent of the so-called villians such as Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, and Tom Felton. However, what really stole the show for me was Alan Rickman. He deserves an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as he reaches his peak in his acting career.\r\n\r\nFrom reading the books, as most people have, I always knew what the end result was gonna be. But in particular Lord Voldemort's scene near the end with Neville Longbottom, it seemed as if, quite possibly, evil would triumph in the end due to the excellent acting on the parts of Ralph Fiennes and the hopelless despair of Matthew Lewis (Neville). Also, the other pefect moments in the movie were the Resurrection Stone and, ultimately, the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort.\r\n\r\n It's not necessarily important to be a fan from the beginning, but you will not be as emotiionally attached to the characters and the events unfolding in this movie as a fan from the very beginning might feel. So overall, whether you are a Potter fan or a newcomer to the series, do not miss out on this excellent tale of good versus evil but more importantly a message of friendship, loyalty, determination and courage in the face of near impossible odds.",

            "content": "I wanted to like this, part one was excellent, the best of the series. Part 2 started very well and was mostly faithful to the book and any adaptations up until the ending seemed reasonable in terms of translating a book into the cinematic medium. Oh but how to drop the ball at the end, I have rarely seen a director so badly miss the whole point of a book's ending. Did the director not understand that the place and timing of the last battle between harry and Voldemort were absolutely critical; Voldemort had been protecting the snake/final horcrux Nagini until Harry's ostensive death in a sort of magical force field because he realised how vulnerable he now was. Only when he thought Harry was did did he think himself safe enough to let down that protection. \r\n\r\nIn the book there is a single moment in which he is distracted by his attempt to make an example out of Neville, and then the angry reaction to that which further distracts Voldemort allowing Neville to break free of his body-bind curse, pull off the burning sorting hat, extract the sword of Gryffindor and in \"one smooth motion\" slice the head off the snake. In the midst of this Harry uses these precious few seconds to slip on his invisibility cloak and begin to surreptitiously protect Neville and his other friends from Voldemort's angry reaction. Only then does Harry reveal himself and the final dual commence. And, in the book this duel takes place for all to see in the Hogwarts main hall; this is important because it is not just the death of Voldemort that ends his reign of terror, it is also the fact that he is shown up as a grandiose and self deluded fool in front of everyone, that all his plans and schemes have been completely off the mark, that he has lost his power. To symbolise that Harry uses his human name, Tom Riddle; he is revealed to be weak and even pitiful, and even offered a chance at redemption, which he of course arrogantly and foolishly rejects. Tom Riddle is revealed as no more than a Tom Fool.\r\n\r\nIn the film Voldemort sees Harry is still alive and has plenty of time to protect Nagini again, but for some reason (unexplained) he doesn't. And to make matters even worse the duel takes place out of the way of everyone else, no one see's Voldemort exposed as a lie, no one see's Harry's victory. It's a complete anticlimax and undermines the relative faithfulness of the rest of the film (and previous part) to the book, what is the point of all that only to fluff the end so very badly? I felt cheated by it. I fail to see why the director chose to mess with such a perfect ending. I can only surmise that he lost the plot, in both senses.",

More importantly, it does so without sacrificing too much of the story (although it would be impossible to fit all of the information from the book into the film, of course).\r\n\r\nMost notable is the development of the characters, especially that of Hermione Granger. Outspoken and opinionated to the point of almost forcing the other characters to take action according to her will in previous films, Hermione stakes a step way back in this film. In fact, there were moments where I actually overlooked her presence in a scene. This much needed growth in her own character's development also allowed the characters of Ron and Harry to step forward and take charge of their own actions and decisions, driving their own characters' growths into adulthood.",

In terms of execution, there were moments that could've and, sometimes, should've been portrayed differently to more impetuously convey the story's crescendoing vision as a spontaneously grandiose orgasm. The director seemed miscast, as at times the movie's already ambitious mannerism stepped away from potentially groundbreaking visual effectiveness. Now the ending along with that could've delivered more visual emotion by showing a castle that nearly every film used for a final shot, instead it remained conventionally impressive. Nonetheless, it's nearly one of, but not, the best Potter instalment and is a stirring end to a universally adored franchise.",

One of its kind though and here is where credit must be given for the visual effects are dazzling , narration is quite good and to be honest it is a better adaptation of the book till it comes to the end whether the death of the primary antagonist of the entire saga literally dies which is absolutely unworthy of the character itself. The sets and the prosthetic makeups are brilliant in this final chapter and worthy of acknowledgement. Throughout the movie we hear recurrent themes of John Williams' original Harry Potter score specially in the epilogue which is where some emotion is tied strongly with the film but to be honest its more of nostalgia and sadness of leaving the franchise than a strong emotional core of the film itself. Although it was a good effort by Yates , the source material was non substantial to begin with and probably one of Rowling's worst pieces. Most of the performances are good specially from Alan Rickman whose total arc is fully realized beautifully by the end and also of the protagonist Harry with whom we grew up and Daniel Radcliffe gives a real strong performance here.",

            "content": "There's a tendency to think of film as a superior medium or art form to television. To think of it as (mostly) having more integrity. While this may be true to an extent, one arena where film simply can't compete is in subtle, measured character development. TV shows like Six Feet Under or Breaking Bad utilize their serial nature to not only develop characters within episodes, but across immense, series-long journeys. Film rarely has the ability or opportunity to challenge TV in this regard, which is what (among many, many other things) makes the Harry Potter franchise so unique. While the films have created a truly remarkable reality from the internationally-celebrated source material, it is our personal investment in the journey that matters most. Watching these characters grow together, learn, experience hardship and be heroic is a nearly unparalleled experience, and in the latest and last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two, that experience closes in an at once immensely satisfying and desperately harrowing finale.\n\nAfter a brief dramatic re-up, Part Two picks up directly where Part One left off: on a hidden beach with our three heroes and a few stragglers. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are still in search of horcruxes, and still grasping with fingernails at any piece of significant information. This desperation leads them to a break in of the Wizard World's Gringotts Bank, complete with dramatic escape. And just like that, Act One is over, and we find our protagonists on their way back to Hogwarts. This return to their old stomping grounds brings them to Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) and his rebel group of young wizards, and comes complete with an ovation that seems directed more towards the majestic old school than the three heroes. Upon his arrival, Harry sets in motion a devastating battle where lives are lost, legends are born, and The Boy Who Lived must face his villain Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) in an emotionally grueling stand off.\n\nThe strangest thing about the Harry Potter films, particularly towards the beginning, is the shifting tone. This is almost certainly due to the likewise shifting directors, with Chris Columbus helming the first two as syrupy kids' movies, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n taking the third into a Burton-esque puberty, Mike Newell making his stamp on a pretty solid fourth film, and David Yates spectacularly ending the octilogy. Yates contribution to the Harry Potter films cannot be depreciated. Not only did he direct half of them, but he seamlessly brought the films to a realm of adulthood that is, not just more interesting, but necessary and hugely important to the story. While Book One of the series finds Harry Potter learning to fly a broomstick and playing with chocolate frogs, Book Seven deals with death in no small capacity. To be clear, lots of people die in this movie. Handling that sort of weight, while maintaining an atmosphere which never strays far from its roots is nothing short of remarkable. Watching this final film, you come to the conclusion that Yates isn't simply a good director, but one who fully understands these characters and the world they reside within and the journey they're completing. He tempers his darkness with light comedy, a choice which could have fallen flat but ends up working perfectly; we care so deeply for these characters and simply aren't interested in a crucible. Yates knows all this, and his superb caretaking has lead to his best film yet.\n\nWatching these young actors grow-and not just the three leads, but all of the Hogwarts standbys-is a powerful progression. Surely these kids were cast for their looks, as the first few films do nothing to suggest any of them will become great, or even particularly good actors. Lucky for Yates and Co., a number of the younger characters have developed into legitimate talents. Rupert Grint and Radcliffe in particular seem destined to escape the shadow of the Potter series, a feat sure to make many washed up child actors jealous. And while Emma Watson has grown into a breath-taking beauty, her skills as an actor have remained listless. Her approach to Hermione has never strayed far from a vacillation between teary-eyed and incensed, and the character in the books simply has more to offer. Meanwhile, the Potter series has never lacked for stellar adult talent, and key elements Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Ralph Fiennes are afforded ample room to aggrandize their characters' respective swan songs. The character of Snape could be called the stories' most complex, and Rickman does everything within his power to bring a satisfying close to his story. As for Fiennes, his Voldemort is as wonderfully despicable as ever. Yates' understanding of the character's imperial solitude is hugely important to the franchise's ultimate payoff, and the two work together to sell it in the most palatable way possible.\n\nUnfortunately though, the books aren't perfect, and this results in a few bruises on the film itself. Most notably, the epilogue sequence is entirely out of place and ineffective. Viewing this film in a packed theater, it felt as though the audience was generally committed to the experience, but at the first glimpse of an aged Daniel Radcliffe trailed by an aged Ginny (Bonnie Wright) with a baby on her hip, nearly everyone burst out laughing. Even worse was the damage done to Tom Felton's Draco Malfoy; his platinum mane thinned nearly to non existent, and a disgusting goatee glued to his face. I understand J.K. Rowling's use of this scene as a clean end to the tale, and an opportunity to make it clear that she is finished with the franchise, but on film, it's simply bad.\n\nWhich is a shame, because this misguided epilogue is the last thing we get to see of the Harry Potter franchise. A franchise that has spanned a decade and spawned a cult-like following. The eighth and final film is a rousing success, despite a few brief missteps, and a production that every last member of the cast and crew can feel immensely proud to have been a part of. Rowling's work, and Yates' expert guidance have concluded one of the film world's most remarkable series with a film both action-packed and emotionally exhausting. Taking this journey with these characters is unforgettable, and like any long, intimate, painful, and joyous experience, is, in the end, just a little bittersweet.",

It was a little short and not as much war and action as I expected and is a bit of a let down especially seeing the build up to this film in part one left this one ready to explode with action and emotion.  You still get those emotions and action in this final chapter, just not as much as I would have liked to see.  An all around great ending to an awesome franchise!",

The tone of the magic becoming dark and disconcerting was foreseeable as legend has it that there are those who experiment beyond a devilish level.  Those desirable Potter fans that have travelled throughout the world of Hogwarts, having been given an illustrated ending full of emotion and power that encourage those devotees to support Harry and his compatriots on their route towards Voldermort\u00e2(TM)s destruction. \n\nThe characters have matured and materialised as have the actors, becoming older and more professional towards their dedication throughout their prolonged Potter endurance. One can only envisage the depth of sadness of the franchise reaching its climax. We have endured a figurative and wonderful relationship between Harry, Hermoine and Ron. They have characterised the film and developed Rowling\u00e2(TM)s paperback into a picturesque reality as they visualised the potential of the series and knew cinema has never and will never experience cinema again like this. The sheer emotions of the actors during the premier exemplified the devotion and commitment to something that will live with them and characterise them for the rest of their careers.  The question is whether the trio can reach the heights of the Harry Potter franchise in future projects.\n\nThis final adventure encapsulates the nature of the relationship and feud between both Harry and Voldermort. Giving us a deepening explanation of the events that have unfolded in the previous seven outings. Voldermort\u00e2(TM)s determination to siege power and defeat the brave Harry brings the pair closer than we have ever seen, giving us a true picture of how J.K.

            "content": "This conclusion to the Harry Potter franchise is powerful in performance, emotion, action, and story all together. Director Yates definitely knew where he was going in making this film that concludes a franchise of a childhood.\n\nPLOT:After Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) finds the Elder Wand, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends continue to the best of their abilities to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes before Voldemort and his army build up and destroy Hogwarts, where the three head next. A war of epic proportions is about to start between Voldemort and Harry and their many followers, but Harry might find that the only way to win it is through a tragic sacrifice. It's an excellent plot executed brilliantly.\n\nACTING:The performances in this film are excellent as well. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson shine brightly in acting their last performances as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The emotion they put into the roles this time feels real, more real than its predecessor's have been able to accomplish, except maybe in its latter additions. Every performance in this film was excellent; there was no bad acting that I could spot. The best performers in this film would be Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, Alan Rickman as Snape, Tom Felton as Draco, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix, Maggie Smith as Prof. McGonagall, Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, Matthew Lewis as Neville, and James and Oliver Phelps as Fred and George Weasley. These few really tied the whole film together. \n\nSCORE:The score in this film is beautifully done with intense and gentle themes by the great Alexandre Desplat. Desplat really knows where to go in conducting scores for these kind of films. \n\nEFFECTS:The effects in this one were very well done and detailed. There was so much creature and magical action from the army of stone soldiers, to the many spells cast by each wizard, and even to the snake attacks. The effects in this one were really action-focused and worked very well. \n\nOTHER CONTENT:This Harry Potter film had to have the best balance between action, emotion, and story that actually works. The emotional backstories of certain characters revealed in here really hit home among audiences. I believe this addition was truly made as a conclusion more than an individual film, but it ended right with a bang and a nod to nostalgia of the generation that grew up with this franchise. Everything in this film just falls brilliantly together to form an ending worthwhile. \n\nOVERALL,an epic Harry Potter film with a brilliant plot, excellent performances, beautiful Desplat score, very well focused effects, a great balance between action, emotion, and story, great emotion in backstories, and a fine conclusion to a childhood franchise of mine.",

Primeiro de tudo: Yates investe (E muito!) em uma a\u00e7\u00e3o dram\u00e1tica, em vez de optar por algo grandioso e escandaloso, como o final do Senhor dos An\u00e9is por exemplo (que aliais \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m muito bom!): e \u00e9 a\u00ed que ele acerta (este \u00e9 um final triste, po\u00e9tico e ao mesmo tempo agitado e \u00e9pico). Segundo de tudo \u00e9 que Yates consegue encaixar uma trama t\u00e3o complexa em uma dura\u00e7\u00e3o de exatas duas horas, fazendo um filme forte e coeso.\nMas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 Yates que est\u00e1 sob os holofotes: Alan Rickman traz uma atua\u00e7\u00e3o inesquec\u00edvel como o professor (e diretor) Severus Snape, recitando com maestria e fazendo pausas (\"Eee...Qually\") que trazem ainda mais mist\u00e9rio ao personagem. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 bem como nunca neste \u00faltimo filme, convencendo bastante de que n\u00e3o importa quantos remakes fa\u00e7am desta s\u00e9rie no futuro: ele continuar\u00e1 sendo o Harry Potter permanente. Temos tamb\u00e9m \u00f3timos atores de apoio, como Maggie Smith, Helena-Boham Carter, Gary Oldman e uma m\u00e3ozinha \u00f3tima do Michael Gambon (Dumbledore). Ralph Fiennes est\u00e1 estra\u00e7alhando mais uma vez como o vil\u00e3o Lord Voldemort, transmitindo medo apenas pelo som de sua voz (em uma sequ\u00eancia em que ele oferece a seguran\u00e7a de Hogwarts em troca de Harry Potter), com seus gestos, suas caras e bocas e seus \"Nyeaahhh\".\nA batalha de Hogwarts \u00e9 divina, algo inesquec\u00edvel, desenhada, dirigida e elaborada com magia. Efeitos especiais impressionantes, muito bem administrados, maquiagem inigual\u00e1vel e uma fotografia de cair o queixo. Por\u00e9m, o que talvez seja a maior falha de \"Rel\u00edquias da Morte - Parte 2\" s\u00e3o as mortes. Elas acontecem de forma r\u00e1pida e at\u00e9 mesmo sem emo\u00e7\u00e3o, n\u00e3o conseguindo transferir um pico dram\u00e1tico como era esperado. Mas comparado ao resto do filme, este erro \u00e9 absolutamente nada!\nUm filme visualmente lindo e tecnicamente lindo para uma s\u00e9rie linda!",

Having grown up with the characters, having known their story, having felt there hardships, the audience deeply cares about each character in the film, and is filled with an immense feeling of pride watching them defend themselves. From the first haunting scene, to the last emotionally resonant farewell, we are enthralled in a thrilling roller coaster ride of action, magic, romance, laughs, and fear. This movie helps define a generation of imaginative moviegoers with its complexity, exciting set pieces, superb acting, and visceral music. \"Part 2\" stands on its own as a true film, rather than a stereotypical \"book to movie\" adaptation. Thus, it displays what I think is most important when it comes to movie adaptations: to look at the film as a film, and not constantly compare it to its book counterpart, because no enjoyment comes from this.",

The parts I'm talking about are parts like when Malfoys dad and that family leaves. I don't like the fact that it just happens. Also this happens a lot in this film I mean a lot. But overall this film had grate action, good diolauge, and just in general a grate story. So I think this was a grate ending to this series but they really should of had more emotion on the situations  \nthat came up.

Perhaps it was simply fatigue after a decades worth of films, perhaps it was the tonal shifts from the more fanciful early books, but I was just ready for this series to end by the time this film worked its way to theaters. The first installment in the two part Deathly Hallows conclusion was just a slog fest, then in the final installment we're given plenty of action, but it isn't enough to make up for a lackluster finale. Was Harry going to die? Were Hermoine and Ron not going to get together? Come on, this had all been choreographed well in advance. There were no surprises here, and it lacks the tight self contained story structure of the early books, made worse by the fact Deathly Hallows was made into two movies. It's not that one movie would have been better, just that two isn't that great either. Getting to see the epilogue of our heroes walking off into the sunset is nice and all, but isn't really sufficient payoff. Somethings just don't translate into great movies. This was a great set of books, but the last few movies are only okay. Despite the very high ratings from its many fans, rated on its own this movie is just okay.",

Snape is my absolute favorite, and I think his memories could have been done a tad bit better.  I was hoping they would be EXACTLY as the memory was in the book, but they cut stuff out.  In the memories, it doesn't show why Snape and Lily don't stay together; it doesn't show what drives them apart.  It would have been good to have put that in there.  I also don't understand why the young Lily didn't have the same color eyes as Harry's!  That's the MAIN thing that Snape loved about Lily and he always noticed about Harry. \"You have your mother's eyes.\"  Well, in this movie?  Not so much.\n\nI don't see why the little girl couldn't have worn blue contacts just so their eyes would match.  She had such a small role in the movie, it's not like she'd be wearing them for a terribly long time (if they were uncomfortable).  Lily and Harry are actually supposed to have green eyes, but Daniel Radcliffe had an allergic reaction or something to the contacts, so they just kept his eyes blue, but they could have at least gotten the young Lily to have blue eyes as well.  In my opinion, Snape's memories are one of the best and most important parts of the movie and should have been given a little more time/thought.  Otherwise, I love this movie.",

It's a yes, because it is generally a worthy end of all the legendary saga, but unfortunately lacks more tragedy and emotion at times, unlike the book, I feel that there were endless possibilities to adapt the great battle and not take advantage at all, yet another annoying detail is that to be the end of it all, the film feels rushed at many times, could have used more time, had removed some comic scenes, which felt much forced and unnecessary. But as I said not a bad movie, but it's a shame to not continue with the tension and excitement of the first part.",

Though I had no idea who each of the characters are beyond the star three; I honestly cared about how the plot developed in each person's world. It really proves the power of the production team and directorial direction. I was left wanting to go back to prior movies to discovery the nuances I had immediately overlooked. \n\nIn short, the movie is excellent and deserves the recognition it has received.

And he got it right. He really, really did. I do think that even those who were less than thrilled with Order of the Phoenix or Deathly Hallows Part 1 can agree that this finale is epic, emotional, and powerful, while still delivering the source novel's simple moral of the acceptance of death.

Or simply have seen it already out of obligation.  But here goes.\n\nSimply put, this is a fine, FINE capstone to an iconic series and bona fide cultural phenomenon.  I have complaints--such as the amount of comic relief and the lightening of the story, as it should be deeply, deeply dark and momentous--but those are outweighed by everything that this film does RIGHT.  Some moments that were tacky in the novel are STILL tacky in the film--\"Not my daughter, you bitch!\"--I'm talking to you.  And some of the moments that were sweet seem tacky in the film--Ron and Hermoine's first kiss--I'm talking to you.  And, truth be told, I have a serious issue with the physicality introduced into the final Harry/Tom (NERD ALERT!) fight; did Voldemort REALLY bitch-slap Harry? But overall, I was happily whisked away by the magic of the imagery here.  How many other films can make a man like me get teary-eyed at the destruction of a SET?  Not many.  It just goes to show how attached I've become to this series, these young actors and this world.\n\nNeedless to say, the adult Brits STEAL EVERY SCENE they are in, and for every jackass that thinks this film series is about Emma and Daniel and Rupert, there are a hundred film people who know NONE of it would have worked if it wasn't for the top-notch talent around them.  Those kids may be talented youths by now, but they have had the likes of Smith, Harris, Gambon, Rickman, Thompson, Oldman, Hurt, Coltrane, Broadbent et al to thank for it.\n\nBe that as it may, thank you, Harry Potter, for 10 years of magic.

After all the events we have witnessed, is this a worthy conclusion for such a beast of a franchise? \n\nWith 3 Horcruxes taken care of and Voldemort gaining the Elder Wand, Potter and company are ready to finally confront the Dark Lord and his army of Death Eaters. Retreating to Hogwarts to find more information about the rest of the Horcruxes, Harry's friend rally around him in order to finally take down He Who Must Not Be Mentioned. \n\nAfter taking care of the exposition in \"Deathly Hollows Part 1\", what lies ahead is the Battle of Hogwarts and the final confrontation between The Boy Who Lived and The Dark Lord, and I have to say this final chapter is a mixed bag for me. With the focus being on the final battle between good and evil, the film does not disappoint in the action department, as it uses the franchise's strengths wisely and continues to bring new magical ideas; and it has the best dramatic sequence in the entire saga (Alan Rickman proved that he was a fantastic actor that could do so much with a stoic character) as it is satisfying and touching. But my main problem realize on the whole concept of the film: It is so focused on the battle scenes that the Horcruxes get lost in the narrative. Since \"Half Blood Prince\" they have been saying that the Horcruxes could be anywhere and they would be heavy protected but in reality they are not. \n\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part 2\" is a bombastic conclusion to the series but it is also an underwhelming one. It is action packed, dramatic, solidly executed and extremely enjoyable.",

            "content": "There is a tiny moment deep into Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2  that passes quickly but stands for a lot.  Harry Potter, now grown to manhood and sporting stubble, is visited by the ghostly apparition of his avuncular former mentor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) who looks at his pupil with caring eyes and addresses him: \"Harry, you wonderful boy . . . you brave, brave  man.\"   Man  is the key word.  In ten years, ever since we first met Harry in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, we saw a wonderful, fresh-faced little boy become a man of wisdom, of strength, of caution, of maturity and of leadership.  This is a character we've grown up with over ten years and now we are watching him go on to his destiny and onward to an uncertain future.\r\n\r\nWhat is most refreshing about this closing chapter is that, after seven previous adventures, it is refreshing to have a hero whose mind, heart and soul are conditioned by the lessons he has learned, and not by the body count at this feet.  Death is a major factor in this concluding episode of the worldwide hit, there are many deaths, but the question looming over this chapter is whether Harry will become one of them.  There isn't a conclusive answer to that question because the ending that Rowling came up with (assuming you haven't read the book) is both baffling and fascinating at the same time.  That, in essence, has been the continuing factor of this series all along and part of the reason that we have kept coming back.  Rowling gift is that she has such a surprising sense of imagination that we don't know what she will come up with next.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2  picks up immediately where it's predecessor left off, with Harry (Daniel Radcliff) and pals Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) seeking objects known as Horcruxes, ordinary objects that contains torn off pieces of the soul of the evil snake-faced Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).  By this point (forgive me if my count is off) there are four that remain and Harry discovers that one of them is locked away somewhere at Hogwarts school, which was absent in the last film but occupies 90% of this one.  As Harry returns, students and teachers at Hogwarts batten down the hatches for a massive battle with Voldemort and his minions.\r\n\r\nWhat is special about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2  is that it is more than just a door-closer, more than just a vessel to tie up loose ends.  There is a lot at stake here, not the least of which is the fact that Harry must take the final steps of his journey alone.  What is interesting here is that, whereas the previous installment pushed aside most of the supporting cast, this one brings them all onstage for the final showdown - everyone gets their little moment.  Yet, the story still remains focused squarely on Harry.  This is his big moment and we see that that overly protected little tyke of 10 years ago is now a man battling the most evil being in the land single-handedly.  That battle would be nothing without a performance we can believe in and Daniel Radcliff, who has seemed distant from the material in some of the previous movies (at his worst he seemed to simply be going through the motions), finds an intense foothold on the character that lends it gravity and weight.\r\n\r\nThe movie doesn't have the overriding sense of dread that Part 1  did (that film was much better), it replaces quiet atmosphere with breathless action scenes.  In fact, after Harry returns to Hogwarts, the movie is one action scene after another.  That's both a blessing and a curse.  There are action scenes here are hit home with striking originality, such as an early scene in which Harry and friends must break into the goblin-run Gringott's Bank to steal an object from the vault of witchy-woman Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham-Carter).  I like the action scenes in these movies because they always have a spark of originality, but if there is a weakness in this last chapter, it is the feeling that the movie is rushing things.  We get to the final moments with Voldemort rather quickly, a little too  quickly I think.  This is the shortest film in the series and there is a lot of information to be imparted to the audience including the legacy of Harry's parents, the truth about Professor Snape, the mysterious machinations behind the death of Dumbledore and the steps that Harry must take to fulfill his destiny.  It is a lot to take in and I think the pacing of the previous installment was better at allowing us to get involved rather then join the film on visceral level.\r\n\r\nWhat the movie does  have is a lot of great technical expertise.  The new additions to the score by Alexandre Desplat add a funerary tone to the proceedings.  They don't just tone with ominous dread but creep under certain scenes and give them gravity and weight and emotion, most especially in the scenes where the full story of Professor Severus Snape finally surfaces.  The set designs by Stuart Craig are mostly made up of rubble and debris, but as Hogwarts crumbles around hero and villain, we are reminded that Hogwarts is one of those great movies spaces that occupies our collective memories as vividly as The Death Star or Tara, Gotham City or The Bates Motel or The Emerald City.  It isn't just a set, it is a place that comfortably occupies our imaginations.  We care  about the things that go on there.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter is a series that - both on screen and on the page - was never content to remain as it was in the beginning.  Like Harry, this is a series that has grown and matured.  Deathly Hallows Part 2  is violent but not bloody and scary but not traumatizing.  It is a polar contrast to the innocence of Sorcerer's Stone with its talking portraits and Quidditch matches (just to hammer that point home, the Quidditch field itself meets a fiery end).\r\n\r\nIt was a wise decision to split this concluding chapter into two parts.  The first part made good use of ominous silences and the spaces between the action where we could get inside Harry's feelings of dread.  This second part is just the opposite, there are few moments of quiet introspection (save for that moment with Dumbledore) and, in fact, this is one long action scene.  Is it the perfect sendoff?  It isn't as spectacular as it could have been, but I must say that I was surprised at how much this movie was able to cover in two hours and ten minutes.  When we get to the concluding scenes, it feels like a fitting farewell.  The door closes on one of the most original and creative enterprises that any author has ever put to paper.  There's a feeling of saying goodbye but an even greater feeling of what is to come.",

It's no one's fault; it's just how the books had to be split up. Before watching, expect a lot of random fighting with not much plot in between. The plot that is in there is hard to follow if you haven't read the books (maybe that's why it seemed like \"random fighting\"). (SPOILER) I was also disppointed in the Hermione/Ron kiss. We waited how many years for that spur-of-the-moment, lack-of-passion kiss? It seemed a but rushed and out of place. But then again, it is a kid's movie, and they couldn't do much more with it. The part where Harry \"dies\" (or whatever he did) was cheesey and weird; I still don't understand it. The only good thing about this movie (which was earlier spoiled to me by E!

Plus I heard the soundtrack and compared to Desplat's previous effort, see-sawing from boring to exciting between hearings, this was simply gorgeous. It painted the film for me and I expect LOTR:ROTK quality in packing an emotional wallup as well.\nI'd argue the pace, caused this thing goes too fast for it's own good. While all others were on the long side, this one I wanted to be longer! But even taken the deleted content into, you see they were cutting to much back and glossing over given the scenes an emotional treatment.\nDavid Yates actually impressed me with his tense atmosphere and suspense in Part 1. None of it carried over in this as all it became just moves from action sequence to another.\nQuestion: What was the point of the Deathly Hallows? They just made their appearances in a few scene, but they weren't important. Becoming 'Death' with the 3 together wasn't even Voldemort's 'grand plan' to begin with.",

I chose to embed this picture as I truly feel that this is finally the character driven episode lot that bridges the teenager barrier to an adult accessible story with good acting, dramatic story and memorable cinematic moments. Don't get me wrong I have enjoyed all of Potter movies but felt that with each passing edition there was a improvement in the value added qualities to both film making and overall appeal. With each the stories grew darker and more likable. I feel the series really took off after bringing Peter Yates in to direct. Peter took a monumental step away from a meager TV career and this gamble will pay off as this may have launched him into movie legend, as this picture may in the end hold the all time gross title. \n\nIn my opinion any great movie needs to have one or more memorable scenes. Although all of the Harry Potter movies had the high tech/special effects moments, it wasn't until the later movies that we could expect epic wizard battles and meaningful scenes of dialogue that will withstand the test of time.\n\nSo if you haven't watch any of the Potter films yet, I suggest you start from the beginning and experience the evolution of great film.

The film doesn't use much of the 3D technology and therefore making it a little bit.....off. I suggest that for those people who haven't watched the 3D version, don't buy the 3D Blu-ray version.",

            "content": "How can something as innocent as he started became so devastating? Preparing myself for the end of his movie saga (yes, the term applies here), I reviewed all the steps of Harry Potter on screen. I saw him learn about the wizarding world, to awaken to their true nature and, finally, understand that this world was not just made of magical adventures and challenges to be overcome, but difficult choices to be made.\n\nEvil exists, and with it, the war was not long, bringing griefs and sorrows that come to its climax in \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2\". Without reintroducing characters or situations, the film takes care to close the loose ends and further deepen the soul of those figures that we saw in our imaginations flourish in the last decade.\n\nThe story ends in a climate that can not be separated from everyday life of Europe in World War II. The World of Magic had been conquered by Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his supremacy. The Ministry and Hogwarts became darker versions than they were at the time that Harry lived in the closet under the stairs, becoming institutions run by fanatical followers of a totalitarian leader deranged. Harry (Radcliffe), Hermione (Watson) and Ron (Grint) have undertaken to destroy the remaining horcruxes to finally make Voldemort mortal and a tar a chance to end his reign of terror.\n\nAfter a complicated stop in Gringotts, the trio discovers that a piece of the soul of Him-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is at his old school, realizing that there will be fought the battle of their lives. A feeble resistance, but alive, persistent at Hogwarts, organizing themselves in a stronghold, the more likely a lightning strike. The faith of a whole nation under the yoke of a dictator remains deposited in Harry. The pieces are organized and the end begins.\n\nThrough stunning photography Eduardo Serra, who balances light and shadows in a way no less than spectacular, magnificent castle that follow become a battlefield in ruins and those children once ascend to heroics. Not for his prowess in combat, but by the strength of their hearts. Hearts will be broken by these losses and brutal revelation of a hitherto unknown hero, moved only by a love which, though unrequited, never ceased to exist.\n\nDirector David Yates realizes that action without emotion is something empty. From this understanding, turns the battle of Hogwarts, one of the highlights of the film, not a fireworks display, but something deeper. The director builds a whole climate of tension to the confrontation, which is announced through the powerful psychic presence of Voldemort in the minds of students and teachers of the school of magic. It is the psychological war carried to its extreme.\n\nGoblins, witches and evil Death Eaters face the true spirit of Hogwarts amid a scene of death and destruction. Not a film for children. Beloved characters die with very little ceremony, with its absence being felt in the moments of silence, not in battle. Yates is not about the war with glamor, but with pain, as it should be addressed.\n\nA flawless cast awards this conclusion. Daniel Radcliffe just remember the little boy who tried to spend some excitement in the beginning of the saga, Harry embodying a more secure, but which betrays moments of panic when he realized his possible fate. Of the trio, Rupert Grint was the most evolved. Careteiro a histrionic, Ron became his one true rock, even with its moments of humor. Emma Watson exudes beauty and grace as Hermione, even representing the \"reason\", ends up being the most passionate of the three.\n\nRalph Fiennes shows why he was called to incarnate Voldemort, revealing more and more of a villain in an impressive range of emotions. Even under all the makeup, the actor displays a range. When weakened, Tom Riddle becomes more frightening and unpredictable. By killing one of his henchmen for daring to speak at the wrong time, we see the anger and fear behind that gesture, not a mere crutch script to display \"as the villain is bad.\"\n\nMichael Gambon returns briefly as the serene Albus Dumbledore, no longer a physical presence for Harry, but his influence is felt all the time. It is worth making a digression on the omission of certain details in the film on the biography of Dumbledore in the book by JK Rowling. Cleverly, the screenplay by Steve Kloves addresses this by stating simply not applicable to the story the man who Dumbledore before Harry was to know.\n\nAnd what talk of Alan Rickman? The actor, who met as the deliciously evil Hans Gruber in \"Die Hard\", appears only in key moments of \"The Deathly Hallows - Part 2\", but his appearances are real treasures. The arc of this closure Snape makes us want to review all the movies of the saga again, just so we can track every move of this true master, not only of magic but of illusion. A complex and fascinating character.\n\nThere are so many names in this veritable pantheon of British legends to leave their mark on the franchise. Maggie Smith's McGonagall shine like never before, almost a magical world of Winston Churchill. Another lady, Julie Walters, Mrs. Weasley finally see her leave the role of queen of the home and defend your children with nails and teeth and wand. John Hurt, Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Broadbent, Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, the underrated Ciar\u00c3\u00a1n Hinds Abeforth emerging as Dumbledore ... A veritable \"who's who\" of the major representatives of the performing arts of the land of the Queen . All appear even at points in this defining moment in cinema history. No egos to be massaged.\n\nWe revisit every moment we spent together at Harry, trying again, even for a brief moment, the warmth of times past and loved ones. This heat which gives strength to go ahead and do not what is easy, but what is right. Recognize in others the sacrifice we make.\n\nThe film is still crowned by the wonderful soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat, which uses themes touched on other chapters of the saga to bring us a sense of nostalgia absolutely necessary, while it also brings us more melancholic compositions that reflect the times this final desperate act. Visual effects complement the experience breathtaking and fabulous art direction.\n\nThe epilogue makes clear that the innocence and joy are passed on through generations. Yes, we grow, but the joys of childhood linger in our children, making them eternal. That's what makes it worth all the pain of growth, knowing that one day our children can enjoy childhood as a magical and friends as faithful as those who had.",

            "content": "\"Harry Potter\" saves the best for last\r\n\r\n\tIt's hard to believe that is was decade ago I was going to see the first \"Harry Potter\" movie with my friends, give or take a few months, and I had been reading the books for at least a year prior to that. It has certainly been a very long journey from then until now, but here in 2011 the \"Harry Potter\" film series has finally reached its conclusion, and, as completely expected, ends on the finest note possible. \r\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2\" combines the perfect mix of true adaptation, and original ingenuity, brining the unique voice of the films to an amazing conclusion, while still providing a familiar story to those who have read the books.\r\n\tThe film begins precisely where the first part left off. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have just escaped Voldemort, once again at the cost of a life of, this time Harry's house-elf friend Dobby. The trio is on the trail of the last of the dark lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) Horcruxes, parts of his splintered soul he secreted away into objects in order to attain immortality. After an eventful bank robbery at the beginning of the film, the three return to Hogwarts for the final pieces of the puzzle and the ultimate last battle against the forces of darkness.\r\n\tIf there are any viewers out there who might have though the pacing in the first part of \"The Deathly Hallows\" was a bit slow, then you'll be happy to hear that the second part is a non-stop action-packed, emotionally charged roller coaster from start to finish. The tone is dark, the action is much more brutal and the stakes are higher than ever. \r\nNot everyone is coming out of the fight alive, and the film does a very good job of not pulling its punches and showing just how much this battle is going to cost. There are quite a few moments that bring a lump to the throat or tear to the eye, especially for those of us who have grown up with these stories and movies for half our lives, There are considerably fewer moments of levity, even compared to the first part, but this is for the best, considering the events taking place are incredibly serious.\r\n\tBecause the second part focuses almost entirely on the Battle of Hogwarts, it gives the secondary characters that were barely in the first part a chance to shine as well. Alan Rickman (Professor Snape), Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall) and Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) all pull off memorable performances, and they're just he tip of the iceberg. \r\nAlmost every significant character from the earlier films is a part of the action here, and it really helps cash in on the nostalgic qualities at play. After all, this is something a decade in the making, and it truly pays off on an emotion and sentimental level.\r\n\tAs always, the acting of every person involved from the main characters to the supporting cast is superb. The writing, which has given the films a unique voice of their own, continues to impress here, invoking all of the right emotions and keeping the tone and pacing in perfect sync. The special effects, as always were spectacular, but the visuals were particular striking this time around, particularly as the Hogwarts professors cast powerful protective charms over the castle.   I did not see the film in 3D, and frankly, after seeing the film in the regular two dimensions, I can tell you it's just as impressive, and cheaper.\r\n\tThere honestly isn't a single thing I can complain about here. Every omission from the book was perfectly justified in my eyes, and considering this film only covers what amounts to the last fourth of it means very little is missing, anyway. Any complaints I would say would be mere nitpicking at this point, and this film certainly doesn't warrant that.\r\n\tThe icing on the cake is the unfathomable box office results: over $168 million in a single weekend.  That knocks \"The Dark Knight\" off the number one pedestal, and most pundits did not think the results would be this monstrous.\r\n\tSimply put, \"Deathly Hallows Part 2\" is one of the finest \"epic\" films I've seen. It's right up there with \"Return of the King\" in my opinion. It's one of those films people will remember for decade to come. Not only because of the cultural significance of \"Harry Potter\" as a whole, but because over the past ten years these films have taken on their own life, apart from the literature itself. Never in the history of film has a single narrative been continued for over 18 hours.  Chances are, it may never be again.\r\nThey are connected, but still separate. It is that uniqueness that makes the films so appealing, even to those very familiar with the stories already. I once again tip my metaphorical hat to writer Steve Kloves and director David Yates, who I grew to like over his tenure at the head of this franchise, for doing such fantastic work with the series. And while it may be a bit bittersweet to say goodbye to so long-running a franchise, I think we're so much the better for the journey taken.\r\nGrade: A\r\nEntertainment Value: 10",

Star Wars was supposed to stop with Return of the Jedi, but now they're talking about a THIRD trilogy of movies. Harry Potter is one of those few exceptions, and for the ending we get most certainly the most well-made and exciting movies of them all that ends on an incredibly strong note that I'm sure had many fans actually crying with the fact that it was over. \n\n     Deathly Hallows Part 2 doesn't waste too much time in getting started. The exciting break-in to Gringotts to destroy another one of Voldemort's horcruxes occurs within less than the movie's first half-hour. From there the pace accelerates even farther as they go back to Hogwarts for the final battle. This film shows why the final book had to be split into two movies. It rockets forward at an amazing pace to get everything done in a satisfying way; there is no filler here. \n\n     What makes this movie awesome for me is all the set pieces, whether they be involved in the Battle of Hogwarts or not. We have the awesome mine cart roller coaster through Gringotts, a cool but brief return of the Chamber of Secrets, an exploding bridge, the fiery room of requirement, and a truly awesome battle within the court yard of the school. Speaking of the battle, I give the movie credit in that I actually understood what was going on in the different parts of the castle as the huge fight took place, even if the main characters don't participate in much of the fighting (though they do more so than in the book). \n\n     If there are a few tiny flaws I have, it's that I would have liked the final, final showdown between Harry and Voldemort to be a little bit longer. Considering everything in the last seven and three quarters movies have been leading up to this, I thought it should have been drawn out a bit more. I'm not going to dock any points since it's still a pretty awesome ending, but I was just hoping for a bit more. Also, I don't think it's much of a spoiler to say several characters die. However, the majority of these deaths happen off-screen, and I would have liked to see what had happened. Once again, this is just nitpicking (especially since it was the same way in the book), but it was just something I would be interested in seeing. \n\n     Everything culminates here with just about every character remaining getting a least a brief cameo in the battle. It's an amazing finale that is far and away the best movie of 2011. Even if you found your interest sagging during the fifth or sixth installments, this one makes it all worth it.",

            "content": "\u00e2Unprecedented\u00e2? and \u00e2epic.\u00e2?  Terms that are attributed far too casually in today\u00e2(TM)s pop culture but remain the embodiment of what the tale of \u00e2the boy who lived\u00e2? has accomplished over the past decade.  But no matter how amazing, how grand or at what heights a saga can climb, it will only ever be as strong as its climatic conclusion.  This is the heavy burden carried by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:  Part 2.\n\nResuming very near the instant where Deathly Hallows Part 1 closed, Harry, Hermione and Ron continue on their mission to destroy the remaining horcruxes of Lord Voldemort in an effort to make him vulnerable.  With very little to go on and still piecing together the significance of the Deathly Hallows, the trio make their way back to Hogwarts to confront the now Headmaster Snape and take back the school.  With each horcrux Harry destroys, Voldemort becomes more unhinged and he sets out to kill Harry once and for all.\n\nDirector David Yates (Deathly Hallows Part 1, Half-Blood Prince, Order of the Phoenix) masterfully and slowly gradients his way out from the jarring, ominous tone he set in Deathly Hallows Part 1.  Largely due to the main three characters emerging from their seclusion and the reappearance of the very important supporting cast, including the Hogwarts School itself.  Even in its dark state, seeing the school again was extremely comforting after the manic transgressions of Deathly Hallows Part 1.  Which may be where some reviews of \u00e2Part 1\u00e2? were slightly short sighted, present writer slightly culpable.  The exclusion of Harry from his friends, teachers and the school in \u00e2Part 1\u00e2? is an integral component of what makes \u00e2Part 2\u00e2? so powerful, but even more important, it may be the key to fully understanding one of the dullest, interesting, vanilla, complex characters ever created, Harry Potter himself. \n\nI\u00e2(TM)m going to break my own rule of not writing in the first person for this review.  Much like a narrator in a film like The Shawshank Redemption or Fight Club, the tactic only works if it truly adds depth and meaning that could not be achieved otherwise.  I feel the need for this because I now believe that I have been something that I definitely do not like to admit being.  That thing would be \u00e2wrong.\u00e2?  I\u00e2(TM)ve been wrong about the character of Harry Potter for seven films.  I\u00e2(TM)ve had expectations that I had no right to presume, I\u00e2(TM)ve been advocating and petitioning for this character to act in a way he was never meant to act.  I was not alone in my frustrations, and I take zero responsibility, no way, of course not.  I was tricked, bamboozled, run amuck, led astray.  I didn\u00e2(TM)t land on Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hogwarts landed on me!  The realization that I\u00e2(TM)ve been so wrong is what sets the Potter \"chosen one\" saga apart from all others.  Not because I\u00e2(TM)m a \u00e2know it all,\u00e2? although that accusation has been cast my way more than a few times, but because being wrong about Harry, putting pressure on him, waiting for him to do something that is completely beyond his abilities, is exactly what the character feels in the story.  I\u00e2(TM)m just another outsider, thinking this boy is \u00e2the chosen one,\u00e2? waiting for his legend to come to fruition and defeat an all-powerful dark lord.  Harry Potter is not Neo nor is he Luke Skywalker.  He is simply a boy who was born into an impossible situation, trying to save the world even though he has no business doing so.  This is not to say Harry lacks special abilities above all others as it becomes quite clear in this film why he has been so often compared to his mother Lily throughout the series.\n\nAside from the great storytelling, witty dialogue, and perfect chemistry you\u00e2(TM)d expect from actors that have been on the same job together for a decade, there are two standout performances in this finale.  No, it\u00e2(TM)s not the nervous courage of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry or the immersive hopelessness once again perfected by Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, this time around its Rupert Grint\u00e2(TM)s Ron and Alan Rickman\u00e2(TM)s Snape who exhibit the welcome evolution of a stronger and a vulnerable side respectively at symphonic moments in the story arc.\n\nDeathly Hallows Part 2 also embraces a much grander Return of the King or Return of the Jedi experience, but makes sure to still spotlight smaller characters, which are so important to the drive behind Harry\u00e2(TM)s purpose.  A good portion of the plot focuses on revealing the answers to many of the questions that fans who have only seen the films have had for many years, but the script is able to incorporate them into the story naturally to avoid feelling like a Wizarding World version of \"This Is Your Life.\"  Readers of the books, who will undoubtedly tell you every single thing that was left out or changed whether you elicit the information from them or not, should also be very fulfilled.  Of course that\u00e2(TM)s taking into account they have enough inherent logic to comprehend if the films were a direct transcript of the books, we would still be awaiting the release of \u00e2Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: Part 3.\u00e2?\n\nSo with the triumph of Deathly Hallows Part 2, the question can finally be seriously debated, is the \"Harry Potter Saga\" the greatest film franchise of all time?  Perhaps, perhaps not.  It\u00e2(TM)s not really a question that would have had a definite answer whether this film emulated The Empire Strikes Back or Howard The Duck.  The real achievement is that the franchise is now in the argument.  Although, during such discussions an ironic parallel will undoubtedly and maybe even unknowingly be drawn to its title character.  Against titans like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Rocky, and The Godfather, advocates of Harry Potter will shout at the top of their lungs that it is easily the greatest film saga of all time and cannot be defeated.  Detractors will claim the \u00e2Potter\u00e2? films have no business being uttered in the same breath as those franchises.  Others may even placate that they are greatly misunderstood, or say that they had so much potential to be greater than they are. \n\nBefore this film, if I had heard an argument such as that I would have aligned myself with one of those facets and fought for it vehemently.  Now I would simply say . . .\n\nBrilliant.\n\n\n\nStory:                 8.0\nActing:               8.5\nWriting:              8.0\nCaptivation:       8.5\nReplay Value:    8.5\n\nTotal =               8.3 out of 10",

Watch part 1 before seeing part 2 just to make sure you have the set up all fresh in your heads.\n\nFrom Rickman to Fiennes to Carter to Smith to everyone inbetween everyone shines, not just the big names Radcliffe, Grint and Watson who once again prove that casting directors sometimes get things right. If anything the casting of the Harry Potter franchise get a lifetime achievement award. Spot on across the board.\n\nDeathly Hallows Part 2 was what we all wanted. From beginning to end we were given a ride that is for the fans of this series. If you are not, not sure whats wrong with you but move along. This is not a movie someone can just pick up and go along with, there is no emotional ties unless you have invested the time and energy into the entire series and than the payoff is magnificent.\n\nThe Harry Potter films should go down in history as a masterpiece of storytelling.",

I was almost beginning to think that Harry was really his son, not James Potter (who they also revealed was a total asshole). I was a little disappointed at Harry & Voldermort's battle. But what did I expect, Harry is nowhere near the wizard Dumbledore was.  Speaking of which, what a dick!!!!  He totally used Harry as bait, all this time.  He really didn't give a shit if Harry survived the finally battle, so long as Voldermort didn't.  Wow. Big picture stuff, I guess.",

Well done to the whole cast & crew for delivering exactly the atmosphere of the final book by JK Rowling. Nominations for only 3 Oscars is just an insult. Definitely deserved the Oscar -or at least the nomination- for best motion picture, direction, editing and cinematography. Should have won the Oscar for best achievement in visual effects and Rickman, Smith and Fiennes deserved at least the nominations for actor/actress in a supporting role.

But things picked up toward the end, and I was moved by some parts, even if I found the film be a massive disappointment. Its better than the first 6, but not its immediate predecessor. This film should have been longer, and it should have had more character moments like the first. I am glad that the series ended on a stronger note than its dismal middle entrees. I would have to give the film franchise an 8/10. For the most part, it doesn't succeed in capturing what made the books so special, it just translates them to the screen. At their worst, they are decent films, and at their best they are superb. But the series needed more films like Deathly Hallows part 1 and 2, instead of being an amazing film series, its just a good film series that adapts a beloved and classic fantasy saga",

The story for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is fantastic and the decision to split Deathly Hallows in half was the correct decision as both parts stay very faithful to the book, not changing or leaving a lot missed out. Not only is the story loyal to the books but it's also gripping as well as there are quite a few scenes that will have you on the edge of your seats, especially some scenes involving Severus Snape, portrayed by Alan Rickman. The performances from the cast are fantastic and it's very easy to say that in this movie, the acting is the best out of the lot. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were brilliant as their characters but the best performance has definitely got to go to Alan Rickman, who plays Severus Snape. There's a specific scene in the movie which involves him that is guaranteed that there won't be a dry eye in the house. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 weren't short on special effects and believe it when you hear that the effects were very impressive from Hogwarts Castle to the creatures to the spectacular fights.\r\n\r\nAlthough Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 wasn't shot in 3D, the 3D worked very well and wasn't underused or overused. The 3D was used in such a way that it wasn't gimmicky where many things jumped out of the screen at you to make you remember you're watching it in 3D but it was great to see scenes such as the Gringotts Bank scene and The Battle of Hogwarts. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 has some fantastic moments and the special effects were used brilliantly. The story has some solid moments and even some emotional scenes, which may bring a tear to your eye. The direction was fantastic as all of the scenes in the movie were very well done and you really cared about all of the characters in the movie. Overall, if you can, watch this in 3D. Many people will disagree with this and will say that it doesn't add anything but The Battle of Hogwarts is very well done and considering Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2is post-production 3D, it's great.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2brings the series to a fantastic end and not only that, this movie is the best out of all of them. It's more magical, more dark and very gripping and emotional. However, be warned, this isn't a movie to take anyone below the age of ten to see. It's sad to see the series go after almost ten years but it's ends on a brilliant high. Well done to all of the cast and crew, you've done a marvellous job on making fans happy and bringing the boy wizard to life on screen.",

It has its moments of beauty and poignancy, but its loyalty to the source magnifies some plot problems even the book had, and Steve Kloves had to pave a few plot holes based on cuts he made to the previous scripts.  A very solid film, but a little more originality and less fan pandering may have made it even better.",

            "content": "The consensus seems to be that the Harry Potter series saved the best until last; and I'm not going to argue - my opinion is that, yes, this is the best of the series... however, The Deathly Hallows Part II is hardly a classic, which should tell you something of the mediocrity of the entire series as well as give an insight into current pop culture.\r\n\r\nThe \"Twilight\" phenomenon, for lack of a better term, also applies to this series of films.  That they all were a commercial success is more a nod towards rabid fanaticism then one towards stellar filmmaking (although I will admit that this last film had some wonderfully seamless CGI).\r\n\r\nI believe part of the issue here is that the books were so well loved - to the point where there are fans who know every bit character and would be disappointed if even the smallest of characters didn't receive his time in front of the lens.  While this over the top fandom is nice (and certainly didn't hurt the bottom line of the film franchise), it hampered all of the films.  Far too often a character would do what amounted to a walk on - often regardless of the pacing or situation of the film - just to satisfy the book freaks.  For a couple of examples: Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix.  She makes a nice appearance in Hallows part I, but then isn't really involved in part II at all (does she even have a speaking line at all, or do anything except cackle before being blown to bits? - and for this Carter gets major billing right below the 3 stars - wow!).  Further, Maggie Smith is mere window dressing throughout all of the films until this last (as if to say - see, aren't we cool, we've got Maggie Smith in our films).  But low and behold, Dame Smith finally gets to do something in part II - which is yet another reason why this one rises above the rest.  It is full Maggie when she animates the guard gargoyles to protect Hogwart and then turns to an associate and admits with that so proper, yet with a gleam in her eye tone, \"I've always wanted to do that spell\".\r\n\r\nIn speaking about Part II in particular; as I've noted, the CGI is wonderful, the acting shows depth, as the main characters, especially Harry, have grown into the roles quite nicely.  Alan Rickman is the usual perfect Snape, and Ralph Fiennes does a nice job of voice emoting through the mask of \"you know who\".  I thought the pacing was good for the most part, though once again a bit too much attention was lavished on bit players (a tighter narrative for the whole series could have been achieved with the judicious exclusion of several characters).  Personally, I rather enjoyed the White Train Station sequence (where Harry may or may not be dead).  I just wish the White Room at the station had black curtains - and so would Jack Bruce, I'm sure.  The conversation between Dumbledore and Harry contains a nice bit of metaphysics - Harry asks Dumbledore if this is all in his mind and Dumbledore replies, \"of course it is - which doesn't mean that it isn't also happening in real life\".\r\n\r\nReally, my only major complaint in this final chapter is tag ending, which is totally superfluous and adds nothing to the story other than a happy ending (yet another bit of pandering to the perceived audience, I'm sure).  The film would have been far better served to have concluded with the three friends (perhaps echoing the triangle that was the driving force for the entire series) standing on the bridge to the ruined Hogwart and, with backs turned from it, looking with determination towards the future.",

The Dark Lord has separated his soul into several pieces-doodads called horcruxes-to make himself immortal. If Team Harry can destroy the horcruxes, they can kill Voldermort. It all ends where it began-in a massive, metaphysical (and slightly cheesy) battle at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\r\n\r\nAfter the klutzy storytelling and inexperienced acting of the first two films, the creative team slowly found their talents; the emotional depth here rivals the better moments of the other seven films. The film still disapparates from one plot point to another, but the approach has grown less awkward. Heartfelt moments are given their final, grave weight in a way that most of the other films missed. After the aimlessness of Hallows: Part One, this second half is thrillingly succinct.\r\n\r\nStill, certain important points still seem deathly hollow. The final fights just feel like they should've been bigger, more epic, with more witnesses. However, overall, Hallows: Part Two is a genuine finale to a story filled with immense love and wonder.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.watermarkonline.com/arts-culture/film/item/6414-screened-out-magic-mayhem-and-memories",

I knew this movie was not gonna be very good when I heard that they thought the ending in the book was not good enough.  such blatant arrogance over the fact that they think that it hollywood is much greater than any novelist.  I have to say without a doubt the hollywoods continued desire to put a sex scene in every movie is truly what was wrong with this film.  there is a scene where voldemort and harry end up flying around and somehow magically combine before they are slammed into the ground.  the only way to describe this terrible image is that harry and voldemort just had magic sex.  this truly horrendous seen is then followed by the lamest excuse for a ending I have ever seen in my life.  I think it's pretty sad that ever since the second movie all the harry potter movies were absolute garbage wit the sole exception of the deathly hollows part 1.  if you even thought that this movie was good I suggest you read the book then you'll understand how terrible this movie truly is.",

I thought this was very important because it kind of secured the leadership role for Nevil after Harry was gone, in my opinion.  Also his death came as more of a shock to everyone, especially Ron and Hermione.  \n\nAnother change that I very much disliked was the final battle. I felt it was much less dramatic than if the entire Great Hall was watching it. Also, Harry's dialogue about the elder wand before his face-off with\nVoldemort was very important and I felt that it was a huge mistake leaving that out.",

This evening I watched the story end in spectacular style as all the threads were tied together, explaining to those of us too stupid/lazy to read the books why things happened as they did. \r\n\r\nAs it unfolded I was gripped by the tension, wowed by the special effects (even in 2D the effects are stunning) but above all else, I felt an emotional connection with the story. The last time I experienced this feeling was during Return of the King and it's story telling / movie making like this that I absolutely love ... and am going to miss badly. \r\n\r\nI've been told that I want too much from the movies that I watch; that I complain too much about some of the dross that I'm expected to pay for. However, you simply cannot compare movies like Transformers or the Pirates series against the Potter movies. In fact, it hurts me to mention these monumental disapointments in the same paragraph as the Potter series. HP7B is not going to be the best or my favourite film of 2011 but it, along with all the others in the series, will always have a place in my heart as being a wonderful story turned into amazing cinematography. \r\n\r\nThank you JK Rowling.

Personally, I never found the Harry Potter series any more original than any other wizard story. Plus, Daniel Radcliffe can't act. Emma Watson and Rupert Grinch were great though, they really matured as actors. But Radcliffe's kept the same recycled facial expressions since he was 11 in the first film. Snape was really good too (BUT IN NO WAY OSCAR WORTHY...more Potter fans ruining something that could have been appreciated).

This would often be a complaint in art for me, as it always feels vaguely fake for a director to feed me exactly what I'm expecting out of a film, but here, it's the only possible solution.  Harry Potter has certainly been about the good struggling with darkness, and like most other stories following the hero cycle, it's difficult to say that it should end in a dark place.  Dark things happen, and by the end there is typically a lot of sacrifice, but the hero must overcome.  That's what we get here, and Yates gives it to us brilliantly.  I will defend to the death that he is the best thing that ever happened to the Harry Potter franchise.  He knows when a film needs silence.  He knows when a film needs a long fight scene.  He knows how to build a scene around small details and focus the camera in just the right way that you can have an important foreground and background.  He knows when to have an extreme close up on someone's face, and when it's necessary for a ton of space on screen.  He knows when to part with his characteristic neutral colors to serve the story.  Just like the book, the most unfortunate part of this film is the epilogue.  It beats you over the head with a bunch of stuff you knew already, capitalizing on cheap sentimentality and making the full circle theme even more obvious.  Aside from that, and a botched line or two from Daniel Radcliffe, this is a great adaptation.  Considering the source material, I think Yates made changes that better serve the story, frankly, and he filled every important moment with the necessary emotion, darkness, and beauty that it deserves.  Well done.",

When you think about how much dedication the cast and crew had to make eight consistent films, it's quite apalling. I must say that the film ended the series beautifully, making many moments more poignant that the books did. We've watched many actors literally age and improve in their acting. The three leads have come a long way in their acting, and their efforts should be applauded here. The film transcends the young adult genre. David Yates' finale to the series gives it an epic bang. There is plenty of dark material in this film. The weight that the three leads carry on their shoulder is incredible. This film obviously has the most action in the series, but also has very intimate scenes, some with a near film noir feel to them. Ralph Fiennes accomplished for Voldemort what the novels did: nearly making me feel sorry for him. Ralph embodies Voldemort scarily well, showing emotions in the character that haven't ever been witnessed. Snape's tragic end is beautifully captured by Alan Rickman. His knowledge of the character runs so deep and it is noticed so well in this film. The special effects and cinematography are incredible, the detail in crafting them astounding when meticulously observed. The action in the film was epic without feeling overblown. Everyone involved in the film wanted the franchise to end in the best way possible and I think they achieved just that. Whine if you want about the epilogue, but I think it was handled in the best possible way. The film kept me engaged from beginning to end and was one of the most enthralling cinema experiences I have ever had. Watching the series make its final mark in cinematic history was an event that I will remember and cherish for many years to come.",

            "content": "Previously on 'Reviewing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'...\r\n\r\n'Deathly Hallows is a tome of a children's novel.'\r\n\r\n'Where the Hell do you get off? You dick!'\r\n\r\n'Grumpy teenager of a film.'\r\n\r\n'The Nick Cave bit...'\r\n\r\n'The Boy Who Lived...'\r\n\r\n'This'll be the best Christmas Walford has ever seen.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcuse the theatrics, but I'm just doing what Deathly Hallows Part 2 refuses to do. Give the casual viewer a catch-up on Part 1. Nope. David Yates makes sure we hit the ground running. And by running, I mean mumbling for 20 minutes in a beach side cottage, but my point stands.\r\n\r\nMy previous review gives the sensation that I'm not a Harry Potter fan. Trust me, I am. My problem with the films is that they are so uneven. I genuinely only count three as being actually any good. Part 2 is one of those. Following the threat of more walking, Part 2 really picks up the minute we get to Diagon Alley and, from that point, very rarely lets up.\r\n\r\nThere's a sense of maturity to this film that has definitely been missing from the others. It's hard to put my finger on what makes me think this, which is pretty useless for a film review I know. The direction is right, the mood is right and the jokes are right. It gives me that warm fuzzy feeling I get when I watch 80s movies from my childhood.\r\n\r\nOne could go on all day about how out three protagonists work so well together, but mention should be made of Alan Rickman. A ten minute series of flashbacks showing Snape's part in Harry's life enforces the reasons why Rickman was chosen for more than just looking like an elderly Trent Reznor.\r\n\r\nThe climatic battle at Hogwarts is bloody without being too dark; a good blend of one-liners prevent it from being too bogged down in its own emo-ness. It's structured so that, whilst long, you don't lose your bearings among the chaos.\r\n\r\nSo, with all the Potter love I'm spewing, you're probably wondering if there is actually anything wrong with it. Well, yes. The attempt to throw in numerous cameos from the previous seven films does distract from the action on screen.\r\n\r\n'Oh no! He's dead. I can't believe it... Wait, is that Jim Broadbent? It is! Oh, and there's Miriam Margoyles!'\r\n\r\nA big special mention has to be made to the ending... I've mentioned my disdain for the epilogue from the book so my heart truly sank when they decided to include it in Part 2. It's awful. It's like watching pre-schoolers raiding mummy's wardrobe so they can play dress up. CGI was not invented for this. Yes, it was put in there to appease the hardcore fans, but so were the multiple endings of 'Return of the King'. That didn't make any more fucking right.\r\n\r\nLong story short, Part 2 finishes the series on a high and I'm sure that Warner Brothers are happy. Now, let's remake all Chris Columbus's contributions and we may be onto something...",

There is no doubt that 90% of the credit should be rewarded to Rowling for her outstanding writing but just like with Eragon, a good book does not mean the film will be entertaining.\r\n\r\nIt has been an enormously long race but now it comes to an end; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and co are set to bid farewell to Hogwarts in what is likely to be an emotional farewell for the cast and crew. Oh yes sorry, the last film wasn't bad either!\r\n\r\nHarry (Radcliffe), Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) continue in their quest to search for the missing Horcrux's in what proves to begin from the climax or there abouts of Deathly Hallows Part 1. After a brief few minutes of dialogue the action kicks off when Harry breaks into Gringots Bank of Wizard's via the assistance of a goblin who then leaves them for dead whilst inside when a fire breathing dragon realises of their presence. However, the trio manage to escape and are soon back in the mix when they realise Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is on to them and is out to kill them, most notably the dark wizard wants to murder Potter who he correctly sees as the main threat.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a very good movie and a more than suitable climax to a fantastic franchise - it is not perfect!\r\n\r\nThe moment that the whole collection of movies have been building up to is a final stand off between both Harry and Voldemort. Unfortunately, director David Yeates decides to ditch the book's version of events for the highly hyped battle which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing; however it is over within minutes and it is a huge disappointment in my point of view.\r\n\r\nAlso, numerous characters did not have their moments of glory. Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) had only small cameo roles in the film and again was involved in a very short battle of her own which again proved rather frustrating. \r\n\r\nHowever, it may not be a perfect ending but Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is still an excellent finale for fans. Although I have not given a five star rating for any of the films due to the fact that the majority of them have a similar feel, I do have to say that as a long lasting franchise which is thoroughly entertaining in each chapter, it gets top marks!",

The positives about it are the score, the overall tone & feel, the performances and the look. I particularly liked the quiet opening to set the stage for things to come... to get louder. The only drawback is that this is a Part 2 film, and as I stated in my review of Part 1, all of this should have all been in one film. An hour or more could have been cut out of both parts to tell a more proper story. The first part drags out and winds down to nothing while this film gets into the real meat of things and ramps everything up to its conclusion. I would say that this could be the second-best film in the series, but I might have to reflect on that in the coming years being that it's still fresh in my mind. Regardless, the series has ended well and it goes out with a very good send-off.",

Others are cut completely for no worthwhile reason, and entire plot revelations that cast much of the series in a new light in the books are also gone. What you're left with is a short and mostly unseen battle scene, a final fight that no longer makes any real sense or impact, and a hilarious makeup-job ending.\n\nIt's not all bad, as the first half of the movie is actually pretty good at depicting hollowed-out versions of events from the book... but this strange, toned-down filmmaking has left me wondering if, years from now, anybody will really remember the Harry Potter films particularly fondly.

Much is missing but I won't dwell on that, no point, its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement, thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory (though a slightly rushed) conclusion. There are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story. I have to say, that despite the woes we book readers have when elements (big chunks of it too) are omitted from the movies, much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen, cleverly weaving, changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.David Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.Pretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out, Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch (if a little novel) but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.Another actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has, is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.As for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns, while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings, I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels (not to take anything away from Rowling's writing). Do I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.What an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew, maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.",

I don't really have any complaints about this film, although it does not exceed expectations. This is exactly a film I would expect if I had never watched a Harry Potter film before, or even any other epic fantasy film made in Hollywood, generally speaking. I admired the many creatures in the world of Harry Potter, plus several of the locations. Voldemort has been my favorite character in the series ever since I saw him in \"The Goblet of Fire.\" Ralph Fiennes is one of my favorite actors of today, so there is a sense of familiarity. \"Part - 1\" had the potential to be very good, while \"Part - 2\" could not have been so much better. I am more interested in speaking about the film series than this particular film. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, who made the great \"Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n,\" should have directed every film in the series or at least every film starting with \"The Prisoner of Azkaban.\" He is easily the best director in the series and I am sure would have done a much better job than David Yates, whose 5th and 6th installments were incredibly disappointing. Maybe, Cuar\u00f3n could have pulled out a great film or two.",

If that's the case you are trying too hard to love a movie that neither warrants it, nor deserves it.  The HP films are a stale and poorly-made representation of a fantastic and wonderful story.  Deathly hallows was no exception; The plot was rushed and not fully-developed, summed up by a random youtuber's comment when he/she asked \"So....How/why did Voldemort die??\".  Dan was as stiff as ever, Emma was predictably over the top, and the few decent actors in the film gave empty performances due to the incompetence of Yates' lack of artistic and directorial vision.   The cinematography was noticeably decent, though it sacrificed shot continuity in the process.  Ultimately the best thing they did was to take an excerpt of the music from the first HP film (composed by HP's TRUE composer John Williams) to use as the farewell score for the finale of the series.  Yet even this was not done properly, as Yates' choice of shots did very little justice to the power and beauty of the music.  For myself and others, this so-called satisfying conclusion really came with Hagrid being applauded in the Great Hall at the end of Chamber of Secrets, before the \"magic\" of the HP films began on its downward spiral.",

Saying I had REALLY REALLY HIGH expectations coming into this movie would be a complete understatement. I have followed this franchise almost religiously, and I have to say... I was a little bit disappointed with how everything was wrapped up and concluded.  I told myself beforehand that I was not going to spoil myself by reading any of the books... so that I would have a better chance of being sucked into the movie. However, as I continued to re-watch this movie, I began to take on a different viewpoint. \n\nI took on a more voyeuristic viewpoint and sadly that made me more critical on this film. For 8 films we have been drawn into the mythology that is Harry Potter... and for 8 films we have been waiting for the climactic battle between him and Voldemort.  I felt like had I been in Harry's shoes... I would have at least had SOME kind of dialogue with Voldemort before zapping him away... or vice versa. Here is the boy who lived... one of your Horcruxes... and you can't conjure up any words to say to him at the very end?  I mean I didn't see this movie in 3D... so his 'flaking away' style death wasn't really all that great to me... but I felt like the final battle could have been a lot better... and a lot of things could have been said that would have concluded things better. \n\nThe music was excellent of course; as expected of the Harry Potter franchise. I did feel like some of the music repeated itself... or at least had the same tone to it. For example, when an epic fight is taking place... you would hear a lot of 'boom boom boom' from the drums... and that, at least to me, was a tad bit distracting. My other complaint would have to be the battles involving the students of Hogwarts.  They could have at least shown individual battles with some of the minor characters... so we aren't left guessing as to what happened to them... or if they got stronger/smarter/craftier over the 8 years. \n\nI do love the religious elements that are found throughout the 8 films though. The whole \"Good vs. Evil\" story line between Harry and Voldemort fits this theme very well... and Harry has that 'self-sacrificing for the sake of humanity' mentality through the 8 movies... which is an allusion to Christ sacrificing Himself to save us.\n\nAll in all, this was a good movie on its own. But I felt like it left too much out.... especially as the 8th and final movie that was 'supposedly' the one that wrapped everything up. That is why I'm giving this movie 4 stars.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Alert]\r\n\r\nFirst, the caveat, I have not read the books.  It is possible the director decided to create these movies with an assumption that the viewer was familiar with the books.  If so, the following complaints are largely moot.  Even so, here are my off-the-top-of-my-head comments.\r\n\r\nWhile all the films progress rather well, and over all they are fairly well executed, I must say, the final films didn't wrap up very neatly.  Unanswered questions are fine when there is an expectation of another film, but not when you know it's the last one(s).  \r\n\r\nFor example, little is done with the deathly hallows themselves, and they seem to take a back burner to the horcruxes.  Except for the wand, they aren't really needed.  Also, how did Harry's dad come by the cloak - assuming it was the deathly hallow cloak.  How did Albus come by the wand and the stone of resurrection; and why drop the stone and leave it in the forest.  (Further, since the cloak was given to Harry by Albus, that means he had all three at one point, which would have made him master of death for a time.)  There appears to be no attempt by Voldemort to obtain the items - other than the wand - and why would Harry tell Voldemort that the wand's allegiance might be to someone else?  The wand's allegiance was a nice twist, but why tell?  And why break the wand? Why keep the cloak (unless it was lost in the vault)?  Albus didn't seem to think it all that dangerous to keep them all.\r\n\r\nWhy did Harry grab Voldemort and throw them both into the chasm?  The resulting flying-smoke-trip fight was rather interesting from a special effects point of view, but not exactly necessary.   \r\n\r\nThe Severus-Lilly patronus connection wasn't quite clear to me.  \r\n\r\nIf Severus was the Half-Blood Prince, was he half Muggle blood?  If so, why would Voldemort have accepted him into his circle?  It's implied that Severus had been in league with V for some time, surely, he would have known.  Would killing Albus have been enough to make such an exception?  \r\n\r\nHow did Neville know about the sword in Hermione's bag?  \r\n\r\nThe more I think about it, the more I see huge holes in the story.  It seems a great opportunity was missed to tie up a lot of little things that have been seen throughout the series into one extremely satisfying singularity, but instead, they opted for something more pedestrian.  Perhaps they should have followed Jackson's lead with Lord Of The Rings and planned on a Deluxe DVD edition with extended / extra scenes.  \r\n\r\nThen again, perhaps I just missed the connections.",

            "content": "From the sensational start to the emotional end, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 is a truly spellbinding film. Continuing from where the previous left off, the plot follows Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger attempting to complete the seemingly impossible task of eliminating the threat of the sinister Lord Voldemort. \r\nSince the release of the magical novel in 2007, fans have been eagerly anticipating the release of the film adaptation. The question is, did it live up to their expectations? Speaking as a Potter fan myself, it soared above and beyond them! The quality of the film justifies the action of splitting the book into two, something which was questioned by many. However, by doing this, the true essence of the novel is captured, and the intricate plot line is depicted faultlessly depicted on screen. \r\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows follows the three heroes; Harry, Ron and Hermione on their quest to fulfil the task set by their deceased headmaster, Dumbledore. As the film progresses, suspense is gradually built up, as the audience are constantly haunted by the knowledge that \"neither can live while the other survives\". As always in the world of Potter, nothing goes to plan, filling the plot with twists, turns and jaw dropping revelations which leave the audience on the edge of their seats, keeping them guessing until the very end.  The epilogue lasts a mere five minutes. However, the transfer from page to screen is flawless, allowing the series to end just as perfectly as it began. \r\nThe heart-warming thing about the Harry Potter films is not only the powerful yet age old message of how good triumphs over evil, but how we have watched the three actors mature and develop alongside their characters. Daniel Radcliffe is not a shadow of the little boy who everyone sympatheised with. He has grown up to be a complex, confident, courageous character; its just a pity he waited until the last instalment to display his true acting abilities! This is displayed particulally in the scene in which he encounters everyone he has lost in his past. His emotion put a lump in everyones throats! Rupert Grint is no longer simply the comic sidekick. Although certain scenes bring a lightness to the dark story , several are spilling over with emotion and grief. This is seen in particular when he finds a member of his family lay dead, and is unable to control his anguish. The stunning Emma Watson has completely transformed from the precocious child we met in the first film. Throughout the series, Watson has been labelled as the more capable of the trio. This talent shines through in this project too. Her portrayal of Hermione brings a depth of maturity, and an understanding of multifaceted relationships. This is highlighted in the epilogue, where she has to portray a person 19 years older than herself!\r\nAs the Potter phenomenon grew, so did the number of famous faces clamouring for a part; Robbie Coltrane, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon and Julie Walters just to name a few. However, amongst these stars, a few shone brighter than the rest; Alan Rickman as Professor Snape and Mathew Lewis as Neville Longbottom.  Throughout the franchise, Rickman has given superb performances, making the snide Professor Snape both fascinating and compelling. However, this installation showed a side of Snape many avid fans would not think possible! In one particular scene in which we get an insight into Snape's past, I was pretty sure there was not a dry eye in the house! Lewis' portrayal of bumbling boy Neville Longbottom added some light comedy to the dark tale. Amongst the battle scenes, Lewis' witty one lines break the ice during extremely tense moments. \r\nAnother thing to be applauded about this film? The BAFTA award winning special effects. Since Warner Brothers announced the production was to be filmed in 3D, amy people thought it would ruin the tradition of the films. However, it did quite the opposite. The 3D effects \"apperated\" you from your seat into the heart of battle! From the dragons to the flying broomsticks, from the breathtaking interior of Gringotts to the majestic Hogwarts castle, the effects team managed to make the make-believe real! The audience were thrust into the heart of the scenes through the 3D effects, treating them to the thrills and spills of an emotional rollercoaster! \r\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is an explosive ending to the most successful film franchise in history. This saga has shown British film industry at its best. Although it is the last instalment in the series, it is most certainly not the end. The Potter films will go down in cinema history. And, as Harry asked his father, \"Will you stay with me?\", his answer is quite true for ours. \"Until the very end\".",

            "content": "Judged on its own merits, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II is a fine film, full of terrific acting, solid action beats, several emotional high points, and exceptional visuals. But as a series finale to an eight-film saga spanning ten years and around 19 hours, it is just a touch underwhelming. It's not 'nothing could live up the hype' so much as David Yates and Steve Kloves making the arbitrarily odd decision to make this film, of all the films in the series, the one that is too short. We have a film series where the average entry ran 145 minutes, yet Yates and Kloves decide to try to end the whole saga in just over two hours. Furthermore, even with that comparably truncated length, the film wastes valuable first-act screen time with business that arguably should have been dealt with in the last picture. When you split up a book into two whole movies, you have absolutely no excuse to feel rushed and somewhat incomplete. Furthermore, I can't think of a single Harry Potter fan who would not have relished a series finale at least as long as the shortest Lord of the Rings film. It is a fine thing to leave fans and audiences desperately wanting more, but it is a less fine thing when there is no 'more' to be found.\r\n\r\nA token amount of plot: When we last left Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley, they had just buried their slain companion Dobby the House Elf and were continuing on their quest to find the last remaining Horcruxes (if you don't know what a Horcrux is and why they must be destroyed, DO NOT see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II this weekend). One thing leads to another, and Harry Potter and his friends find themselves back at Hogwarts, where Voldemort has given the student body an ultimatum: deliver Harry Potter or everyone in the school dies. Needless to say, the school does not give in. The students and faculty scramble to protect the school from an entire army of Death Eaters, which will hopefully give Frodo the time he need to... err... I mean give Harry the time he needs to destroy the last remaining Horcruxes and thus finally take out Tom Riddle.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, despite my whining that will come in later paragraphs, the film is a technical marvel and a generally exciting action-adventure. The finale, like the series, distinguishes itself amongst a sea of big-budget tent poles by emphasizing narrative and character over spectacle. When we think back to the favorite moments, it is not the action sequences but the character interaction that come to mind. We love the time spent with Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna, Ginny, Draco, etc. We love the limited time we got to spend in the company of such dynamic actors as Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, Robbie Coltrane, Jason Isaacs, etc. And we get a sprinkling of such moments in this final chapter. But those moments are surprisingly few and far between, as the film so far out of its way to focus almost exclusively on Harry Potter vs. Voldemort that the rest of our beloved characters get the short shrift. Of course, one major supporting character gets his moment to shine (no spoilers, for the two of you who don't know), and it's easily the best, most emotionally devastating scene in the picture. If Warner is willing to spend the money, 'you know who' (no, not THAT 'you know who') could end up with his first Oscar nomination. But there are far too few such moments for the rest of the heroes and villains. Yes, the series has been Harry-centric since The Goblet of Fire, but again, this is the bloody series finale!\r\n\r\nThere are various crowd-pleasing moments in the final battle scenes (most of which are supplied by Neville Longbottom), and there are moments are shocking violence (children die onscreen, sometimes graphically). But most of the big Hogwarts battle basically takes place off-screen, as we follow Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they look for Horcruxes inside the castle. This may not be a fair comparison, but I was reminded of the finale of the first Transformers, where the Autobots and Decepticons engaged in a battle royal in downtown LA off-screen while the camera was focused on Jon Voight shooting bugs with a shotgun. We want to see more than just a few moments out of the corner of the screen of our stalwart Hogwarts heroes holding down the fort (and paying the ultimate price). The final battle is cleverly fleshed out into something more physical than merely two foes pointing wands at each other, although said battle is less emotionally engaging than you'd expect (I was frankly hoping for something resembling the weary fatalism of the Neo/Smith fight in The Matrix Revolutions). There is a semi-tracking shot as our three main heroes race through Hogwarts and we see the great battle unfolding before our eyes that is both wonderful and frustrating. It's a great, epic moment that nonetheless serves to remind us of all the glorious such moments that we didn't see because we were busy watching our main heroes try to stab a necklace. Yes, the series has always been more about character than action, but again, this is the bloody series finale!\r\n\r\nWhen a major character cradles the dead body of another major character, the moment is so fleeting my wife (who hasn't read the book) couldn't tell which specific character had been killed. And when a major villain is killed onscreen in a most surprising manner by a most surprising hero (arguably the biggest crowd-pleasing moment in the book), it's edited so tightly that we can't tell who said hero was defending (again, my wife, who hadn't read the book, didn't know who was in peril). I understand the reluctance of the filmmakers to turn the film into a full-on Lord of the Rings-style war picture. But this is the series finale of a 19 hour saga... they've earned the right to tack another hour on and go a little crazy, especially when the source material is right in front of them. Considering how much good this truncated film still contains, I can only imagine that the three-hour cut would not only be the best film in the series (still the seventh film, natch) but one of the better fantasy films of our generation, something to stand tall beside The Empire Strikes Back and The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.\r\n\r\nBut as it stands, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II is merely a very good film in the franchise, and a very good fantasy film in its own right. What is included in the film, especially in the last two acts, is certainly worth our attention and our praise. The acting is peerless throughout (Maggie Smith has several lovely grace notes), and there are indeed scenes of genuine power and tear jerking emotion (prepare to weep when Harry pulls out the 'resurrection stone' in a key moment). The actual onscreen action is generally gripping and impressively staged, and there is a brutal casualness to the violence (who lives and who dies is often random and arbitrary). The score by Alexandre Desplat is appropriately stirring, and he knows exactly when to bring out the John Williams themes for maximum effect (the first use of the main theme is so perfect I wanted to stand up and applaud). And like the book, the film concludes the saga with a narratively simple but symbolically profound epilogue, a stirring reminder of what Harry and his friends were fighting for. And unlike certain series finales (cough-Lost-cough), it does make the viewer greater that they actually stuck it out and watched each successive installment.\r\n\r\nEven while I carp about certain details of this final chapter, there are two things that must be stated (if you have the soundtrack, start playing the 'leaving Hogwarts' theme... NOW). First of all, quite simply, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II is still better than any fantasy picture released in the last ten years that isn't a Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars film (I love Revenge of the Sith... sue me). Second of all, one cannot ignore the momentous achievement that is the Harry Potter saga. Eight films, perfectly cast right from the start by director Chris Columbus (who really deserves an apology from quite a few of you) and with a consistency in construction and general quality that was, let's be honest, as much about luck as talent. Luck that all of its young would-be wizards stayed interested and became genuinely solid actors (and ahem... aged well to boot), luck that the adult cast had not a single defector or major change save for one untimely death (RIP Richard Harris), luck that Warner Bros had the good sense to rarely if ever interfere with the creative process, luck that audiences stayed with the series even as they got older, luck to the extent that any one good movie is partially about luck, let alone eight consecutive relative triumphs.\r\n\r\nThere will probably never be an ambitious undertaking like this again, certainly not in our 'do trilogy and reboot' era. The Harry Potter series is everything we say we want from our big budget filmmaking, and we write it off as 'pop-culture junk food' at our peril. The highest compliment I can pay to the series is that, as a long form saga, it truly deserves to stand alongside Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. The highest compliment I can pay this film is that it falters mainly in comparison to our expectations (and our knowledge of the source material). It says a lot about the adventures of 'the boy who lived' that a film this good could still be 'disappointing'.",

I've seen all the movies prior to this one and have read the Deathly Hallows book.  Needless to say, I knew what I was getting into.  I was a little bit skeptical when I saw this in the theatre because they broke one book up into two movies but I knew it couldn't matter that much.  I do also want to add, if you haven't seen the first six in this series please don't even try to check this one out.\n\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the seventh part in the series.  The story revolves around Harry and the character Voldemort trying to destroy one another and their quest of good vs evil.  One of the nice things about this film is that you can view it on a surface level and just enjoy the main plot but if you are like many other and are a junkie then you can dive into much deeper levels of detail.  The story finishes the series quite nicely.  The pacing is very good and throws you a few twists here and there. I was however confused by a few minute story parts that were left unanswered (i.e. Ms. Norris), but I suppose that's probably unavoidable for a series so deep though.\n\nAs with all of the Harry Potter movies the music is excellent.  The theme song, by John Williams, is a perfect fit for the series.  The rest of the score fits the movie very well and keeps rhythm with the story arc.\n\nNormally I get into who the actors are, I'm not going to do that this time.  If you want to know please go to this link to check out all of the fantastic cast and crew to the finale in the Harry Potter series.  There are simply just too many people to name but they all do a really nice job.  My only complaint is one character changed actors, because he got arrested. They ended up swapping out a fat white kid for a skinny black kid and called it the same character, it made no sense at all!\n\nThis really is a fantastic series to watch for any age from about 10 and up.  If you haven't seen it before I would highly recommend it.  I'm not a \"Potter maniac\" but I did enjoy watching all the films.  I would put this one up there with Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.  Anyone with some time on their hands might want to try a weekend marathon!",

It really is the definition of an event film where watching it alone is not nearly as enjoyable as with a full theater on a big screen. Having said that, it's still a solid film on all technical levels. The story is of course excellent thanks to the novels and everything wraps up nicely.

Also, I didn't quite get the twist at the end, and I thought it was more or less a cheap ploy just to get to the \"15 years later\" part, which, by the way, I didn't like. I think Rowling could have ended it better to give anyone who followed this story a more climactic send-off, but instead, she took the easy way out. The only time I was more disappointed in a finale, was Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, but for very different reasons.

What a phenomenal ending to a phenomenal story, a story that has been with many of us since we were old enough to read (I know that's how it started for me). It honestly really was bittersweet for me, this being the final movie and all. But enough of me being emotional. I may be slightly biased, but I thought it was amazing. Yes, there were changes from the book, but honestly, I was ok with almost all of them. To me, movies based on books are no carbon clone copies of their inspiration. If they were, they would be pretty damn boring, and there would be no need for a screenplay writer, or directors, etc. The movies are supposed to put a creative spin on those originals, while still remaining faithful. I thought this movie did a perfect job of that. Going in, I was a little worried it would be all doom and gloom, as the last half of the book is, but the movie did a nice job of throwing in some sentimental and comedic moments that really helped lift the mood in what otherwise was a rather somber movie. Honestly, it was sad seeing actors such as Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Tom Felton, Matt Lewis, and others taking on those iconic roles one last time. But, that tone of finality really struck a chord and only made all of their performances that much stronger. The Battle of Hogwarts was done very well. I actually liked seeing only snippets of the battle, then having Harry walk in and have the audience discover along with Harry the terrible damage that had been done, it was a very powerful moment. Now, from a huge fangirl perspective, I cried about four or five times, and was a complete hot mess at the end. I don't know, I guess I just felt like I grew up with these characters then everything in the epilogue coming in full circle just turned me to tears. So. I'm going to stop rambling now. But, I can honestly say that I laughed, I cried, and that no matter what, I will always remember the fantastic magical journeys that J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter took me on. Thank You.",

There are quite amazing scenes of flying wizards, giant spiders and scary trolls walking the grounds of the famous school and destroying everything in their path. Every single combat scene is stressed by special effects and it all ends, like in a symphony, with a grand finale.\nThe big difference with the previous chapters is that in here there is very little talking and lots of action scenes; it is a very dynamic film, movement non stop. \nI don\u00e2(TM)t really know if I get the whole \u00e2death\u00e2\u009d of Harry.

The consequences and darkness added over the previous films greatly increases intensity, however a stark palette is occasionally mistaken as maturity and the kid-friendly origin of the Potter series means the end is never in doubt. Consistent with the characters' wizardly development, the battles of this final chapter are larger and more striking than ever. The level of action is a great payoff from Part 1's long wander. In fact, so much happens that there seems little time to linger on choices, which is likely balanced by viewing the two parts together, combining a slow, escalating build with a fleet, exhilarating climax.",

He loves playing Lego Harry Potter as the Voldemort character because Voldemort has individually more powerful spells than anyone else, including the unforgivable excruciating torture version of Wingardium Leviosa and a Crucio Curse that reduces complex life forms to their basic Lego constituents.\n\nBefore we watched the final battle, I asked Luc who he thought would win. He was sure Voldemort would be victorious because Potter was no match. I explained that it would not be only Potter against the dark lord, but the combined mind, good faith, love and power of his friends. Luc tried to tell me that Voldemort had loving friends too, but then corrected himself to say that their fear and desire for power would make them more loyal than the light side's friendship.\n\nThat's where Luc's argument fell apart. The dark side can certainly destroy, maim, kill and steal better than Potter and his friends, but that puts dark power at an inherent disadvantage. Voldemort and his team need others to rape and pillage in order to enjoy their dark power. They are parasites. They cannot turn the entire world to the dark side without destroying their host.\n\nWhen Potter broke the Elder Wand, he dissented to that type of power. His strength and fortitude would be earned, not stolen. He would be accountable to his friends because only through love is real and sustainable innovation possible.",

It has way more of a charge-ahead, wake-up-and-fight tone than its sleepier, duller predecessor, and Ralph Fiennes manages to emerge (from briefer past appearances) as a substantive, well-rounded force of evil.\n\nHarry and his allies, still in exile from the end of PART 1, regroup to destroy the rest of Voldemort's Horcruxes (hidden soul segments) and to find the Deathly Hallows: that death-defeating triptych of cloak, wand, and stone that everyone wants so badly. The scene of their complicated sneak into Gringotts is well done, very excitingly rhythmic, with some interesting editing... and nice (though predictable) silences. Harry, Ron, and Hermione then have to return to the beleaguered Hogwarts campus to defend it from Voldemort and his army. This is when the balance tips slightly too far--in the last film, too much \"waiting\" with only some occasional dynamics; during the Gringotts run-up, comfortably and dynamically tense between \"waiting\" and \"melodrama\"; but in this Hogwarts climax, too much straight \"melodrama.\" \n\nWith frantic, hysterical strings, it's revealed everything has been fated: Snape crushed on Harry's mother, so Dumbledore enlisted him as a secret lifelong ally for Harry, who's all along been the secret (unknown to Voldemort) extra Horcrux. Temporarily dead from sacrificing himself to get rid of all the Horcruxes, Harry commiserates with the dead Dumbledore in a kind of weird limbo, and asks him at one point, \"Is this real or in my head?\" to which Dumbledore replies, \"Of course it's in your head, Harry; why should that mean it isn't real?\" Um, I could think of a few reasons mental things wouldn't be real, but no matter: Harry learns the Deathly Hallows wand is his, so he revivifies himself to ultimately defeat Voldemort. There are some battle scenes, calmly shot and wonderfully constructed; some sappy triumphalism; and then -- get this -- a happy ending.",

Today, the series has ended. Does the final installment of the series top off the rest of the installments? Yes, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II\" is definitely the best of the series and possibly one of the greatest movies ever made! Now, I've been growing up with the films since I was six years old, this is my favorite film of the whole series! Now that is coming from a HUGE Harry Potter fan, and when I mean by HUGE, I mean a HUGE Harry Potter fan. Anyway, back on topic, the film deals with the final battle between Voldemort and Harry Potter, and that's all I'm gonna say about the plot. This film is not meant to be spoiled to anyone, THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE THIS YEAR!!!!! This film was powerfully acted and the film was well scripted. The actors have been great from start to finish, but they did their best in this installment. There's more to say about this film, but I don't want to talk about it that much. The only way to know about this film is to experience it yourself. You'll cry, weep, laugh, be thrilled, and hang on to the edge of your seat till the film end! I loved this movie, as I said, this is a must see film of the year. \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II\" is thrilling, dazzling, and superb! I give this film four out of four stars, my final TOMATOEMETER rating is 100%.",

On the other hand I'm a big fan of the books, and this movie out of all the films needed to be more faithful to the source material. It is tough because there is no way for me to disconnect my knowledge of the books when evaluating the film, so I'm not sure how to review it fairly. \n\nI can say with certainty that they nailed a lot of the emotional moments that a viewer looks for in a big climax like this. The assault on Gringotts was very well done, and the epilogue was basically word for word from the book. I think they covered all the important plot points so a person who never read the books should be able to follow along. And the final battle was visually spectacular, even if it wasn't quite as a reader might envision it. Perhaps this is the biggest struggle I have, deciding whether they should have kept the climax as written or used this more flashy Hollywood ending.\n\nThe biggest thing I felt was missing in the film was a proper explanation of Harry's battle between Horcruxes or Hallows. You'd think that, with the book being split into 2 movies they might have made room for more exposition. Harry's choice to speak with Griphook before Ollivander doesn't even seem interesting, and therefore the movie-going audience never appreciates just how selfless Harry is throughout. Plus they never even discuss Dumbledore's past, so the appearance of his brother seems to come out of nowhere. As a movie-goer this is a 5-star ending to the series, but as a fan of the books it loses a star for failing to tell the whole story.",

Either make it a kids movie and tone down the violence and play up the message or make it a grown up movie with some gore, cursing, and a little more desperation on the part of the characters.

I think that if you have a flawless book that you base you movie on, then why screw up the movie by changing up the book?? \n\nThose of us who have read the books 4 and 5 times each, appreciate the work that JK put into each book, but wonder why the directors and screenwriters feel they have to change perfection.",

            "content": "I've decided I'm going to make a new review of Deathly Hallows Part 2 mainly because I don't think the original review did the movie enough justice. After all it is my favorite movie of 2011 and my 2nd favorite movie of all time. (Behind Inception) So Part 1 was all just the build up to what is going to be the epic climax to the series that influenced a new generation of readers. I just want to start out by saying that splitting Death Hallows in two parts was totally justifiable. The book has so much detail that skipping over the tiniest bit of information would leave a huge plot hole in the series. Splitting it into two parts was the smart thing to do...then Breaking Dawn copied it. Seriously, Deathly Hallows needed the split to focus on the details and also stay true to the character development, sub-plots and emotional appeal. Breaking Dawn Part 1 was just two hours of \"Bella, I love you, let's play chess on our honeymoon.\" In my Deathly Hallows Part 1 review I gave high praise for the opening scene for setting the mood for the movie. Part 2 did the exact same thing. The opening scene is about 45 seconds long and there's no dialogue, but the way it plays out with the music, cinematography and Alan Rickman's acting was just perfect. One thing that easily went unnoticed by quite a few people (The Oscars, for example) was Alan Rickman's portrayal of Severus Snape. He's dedicated ten years of his life to the character and to the series and it really shows. His performance in this was amazing. How was the rest of the acting? It was great. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have really matured throughout the series and their performances in this were flawless. Maggie Smith was great as Professor McGonagall, Ralph Fiennes is the perfect Voldemort, Helena Bonham Carter was (as usual) fun to watch, and Bonnie Wright was hot. (What? Girls do it with Twilight guys) But the badass of the year award definately goes to Neville Longbottom, brilliantly performed by Matt Lewis. Neville does a lot in this movie. What he does involves spoilers  so I won't ruin those, but it was awesome to see him evolve from British Jar Jar Binks to British Chuck Norris. The special effects are some of the best I've ever seen. There's one scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione are in the Room of Requirement and they have to escape from Fiendfyre (Everlasting demonic flames) and that scene rightfully so won the \"Holy Shit Scene of the Year\" award at the 2011 Scream Awards. The cool thing about the action scenes is not only are they entertaining, but they don't overshadow the plot. Most action movies today usually have a tendency to put more focus on action scenes rather than a story. (Do I really need to say which director I'm talking about?) David Yates is a very underrated director. He makes his story driven by character and the audience can connect to them, making the story more emotional and powerfull. Speaking of emotional, there are some scenes that, if you're a big enough HP fan, will make you want to cry to a crazy degree. I myself actually got teary eyed during some scenes. It is with great reluctance that we bid farewell to the most successful movie franchise in cinematic history. It was an astounding ten years, but just remember one thing:\nHarry Potter is the end of an era.\nTwilight is the end of an error.",

            "content": "After enduring the long journey that Harry and his companions had to undergo, the grand finale presents us a full fledge war that makes up for that long journey. Just as I said in the first part of \"Deathly Hallows,\" I have not read this or any of the other Harry Potter books, so I cannot judge if everything is accurate; however, as a film, it had that kick that I wanted in this final entry to the series. The pacing was just awesome, it had this non-stop excitement, and was everything that Potter fans and viewers who have watched and enjoyed the wizard flick ever wanted. One thing that I thought was a nice touch was to bring back every character who you've come to know in Hogwarts and allowing some of them to do something quite surprising. From the students, whom are all grown up, to the teachers who may only have appeared in one film, but they will make a cameo appearance before the climactic battle. One thing that I thought was a job well done was to have every question that was brought up in the previous stories be answered in this final flick; answering character's motive, past events, and loopholes that were previously left untouched. A great way to answer everything, and answering questions that will satisfy everyone.\r\n\r\nThere are some pretty surprising moments and contained scenes that were slightly moving; however, there is one scene that really surprised me the most. I will not say anything about it, but it is a flashback of one character and as surprising as it was, it was actually quite moving. Here I was laughing to myself, thinking that I will never be touched in a \"Harry Potter\" film; this scene just did what I laughed myself about. It was more of a twist, in my opinion as it did surprise me, and as unexpected it was, it was a very touching scene.\r\n\r\nAs seen in the trailer, there is a huge battle that occurs at the school and it wa quite an epic battle. All of the characters fight, some die, and you'll see a great amount of magic and triumph that you will ever want in this franchise. The battle was just awesome to watch, as I had a blast just watching carnage take place and watching a group of people being knocked out or killed. Once again, the CGI and special effects were phenomenal and it helped bring in the magic that you have enjoyed in this franchise. My only complaint about this battle was not depicting the death of some characters. As sadistic as it may sound, portraying the death of the characters will add more of a shock than to show them in one scene and dead in another. Part one did that as well and as slightly disappointing it was, it didn't affect the film in any way.\r\n\r\nAs said before, there is nothing new to say about the acting. Personally, all of the cast were great as their roles and the film had great character. If the character is alive and worth mentioning, then you will definitely see them, possibly a glimpse, but you will be able to see these characters once again. \r\n\r\nThe only major problem that I had was the ending. Don't get me wrong, it was a good ending and a good way to end the decade running wizard film; however, how it was shot was quite disappointing. I didn't like what the director did and pretty sure people who have watched this film can say the same. \r\n\r\nA decade ago, Harry Potter hits the big screen for the first time, and now it has reached its end. It was a great way to end the series, presenting a great battle, all of the characters from the predecessor return, and was quite fun.",

Like the other films, some of the sub plots from the books had to be left out and there are some minor changes in plot/settings to make them more celluloid friendly. All are done with due care and attention. I have to cut off half a star from the ratings though for the irritating (and I suspect post rendered) 3D. Throughout there was so much 'ghosting' on the image and no real use of 3D's 'potential'. 3D was tried in the 70's and died a death.

I feel that they went over the top and focused too much on the special effects of this particular scene and rushed it, taking away from the emotional aspect. The death of characters such as Tonks and Lupkin were not highlighted enough, except for a quick view of their dead bodies. This was an important scene and should have been executed much better, instead I feel it was very much a mess. It should have been as long as the battle scenes in LOTR, if not longer. The scene of Harry seeing Snape's memories in the pensieve was excellent, I don't think it could have been any better. The death and evaporation of you know who into some sort of slow moving black flakes made for a lackluster ending, and one wonders if this was only added in for the 3D effect. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a good movie, but considering how much vivid material the book provided, not as good as it could have been for the ending to one of the greatest series of our time.",

The eighth and final movie picks up immediately where the last one left off. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) continue to search for, and destroy the four remaining Horcruxes that keeps the villainous Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) alive. In the midst of it all, wizards from around the world must come together to fight Voldemort's Death Eaters in a battle which will determine the fate of the world. Out of all the films this one has the best special effects as it is a perfect way to portray the great battle. All of the acting was great and the supporting characters are finally given the chance to shine. This is the shortest Harry Potter film with a running time of 130 minutes, which gives the film pretty good pacing and it doesn't lose its momentum except for in the third act.\r\n\r\nThere are touching moments, but some of the character's deaths just felt unimportant to me. Maybe they had more emotional impact for the numerous fans who have read the novel. Also, as I said before, the pacing stalls in the third act for a while, but got back up to speed.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this is the best Harry Potter since \"Prisoner of Azkaban\". It is a fitting goodbye to one of the most lucrative franchises in history. There has never been a franchise quite like Harry Potter. The filmmakers have managed to keep the series strong and mostly faithful to the source material. The three main actors have gotten better with each movie and I am sure they will continue to improve their craft over time. The series gives audiences the rare opportunity to see characters grow up on the screen. There have been eight movies so we feel like know the characters. That is why it is so emotional at the end. As far as the 3-D goes, it is impressive at times, but not enough to recommend.",

            "content": "I'm a fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I have read all of the books and own the first seven movies. My favorite in the series is the Prisoner of Azkaban, while I rate Deathly Hallows Part 1 as the weakest entry.\n\nIt seems that Part 1 moves slowly and contains too many insignificant scenes. In contrast, this final installment feels a little rushed. It runs about two hours before the credits start to roll and tries to cram in the final showdown, while tying up as many loose ends as possible. Some of the threads are resolved using rather clumsy exposition and deserved more screen time. My final quibble involves the use of quick cuts to increase the sense of action. The story was good enough to do that on its own and I didn't feel that it was necessary to turn some of the scenes into something resembling Bourne.\n\nAlthough the movie isn't perfect, it's still a fine way to end a thoroughly enjoyable franchise.\n\nI can't imagine that this final entry will be seen by many people who avoided the first seven movies, and that's a good thing. The story picks up right where Part 1 ended and introduces us to many of the characters from the first seven movies. It wouldn't have much impact as a standalone movie and it's not supposed to. \n\nThe story follows Harry, Ron and Hermione in their search for the remaining horcruxes. The first hunt is a spectacular affair which is heavy on the special effects and action. I'm aware that many viewers will not have read the books, so I'm not going to spoil anything. If you read the final book, you'll be aware of which sequence I'm referring to.\n\nFor anyone who complained about the absence of scenes involving Hogwarts in Part 1, much of the action takes place at the school in this concluding part. What struck me is how different Hogwarts looked when we were first introduced to the world of Harry Potter. Gone are the vibrant colors and whimsical interactions with ghosts or paintings. Instead, be prepared to enter a dark setting. I mean that literally as the setting is extremely dim for about 95 percent of the movie; think Gotham City for a comparison.\n\nAnother thing that I noticed is how much the acting has improved. The main characters were around 11 years old when the franchise was born, so they are about 21 now. Radcliffe held his own in scenes involving some of the best British character actors of their generation. Watson and Grint played their parts well, and it's a tribute to the original casting that the franchise has developed as well as it has.\n\nIt should be noted how important some of the supporting actors are to the success of the franchise. Can you imagine anyone other than Alan Rickman as Snape? His story is one of the most interesting in the series and sees a fitting conclusion. I'm also fond of Maggie Smith's portrayal of McGonagall and love her role in the final installment. You'll see actors that have appeared infrequently given a little recognition, and they deserve it.\n\nI watched the movie with a large audience made up of children and adults into their sixties. Although the sense of evil was always present and the setting was dark, the audience found plenty of scenes worthy of laughter. It's a truly entertaining movie.\n\nThe movie might have improved if 30 minutes were added so that everything felt less rushed, but it could have affected the tension if we were given more chances to breathe. The sense of scale reminded me of some of the battles seen in Lord of the Rings. Replace Voldemort's minions with orcs, and there were quite a few similarities.\n\nFans of the Harry Potter franchise, and I am among them, will be pleased with the way everything is wrapped up. After a disappointment in Part 1, the conclusion was worthy of the story created in the first seven movies. To see who lives, who dies, and what happens to the survivors, you'll have to check it out for yourself. I thoroughly recommend the experience.",

The final confrontation to Voldemort is quickly coming.  And Harry must decide what he will do.  Will he stay, and fight with his friends, risking their lives in the process?  Or will he confront Voldemort head-on, and possibly die?  This film is everything the rest of the series is, and more.  Everyone and everything is as you remember it, except even better.  The actors are the best they have ever been.  The story is as moving, touching, and epic as it has ever been.  Yates makes sure the film is as faithful, and entertaining, as the last novel is, and delivers a fantasy-epic that is just as vibrant, dark, explosive, and adventurous as a \"Lord Of The Rings\" film would be.  The only weakness is the complex plot, which may confuse viewers who have never read the books.  But with the way the film has turned out, I honestly wouldn't have changed a thing from it.  A faithful adaptation, a great movie, and a fantastic way to end a cherished franchise.",

            "content": "The final installment to the billion-dollar franchise is a marvel for movies in general. Every aspect of this film is beautifully executed. First, the soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat is magical; delivering a homage to John William's original score for the first film, only boosting it to a level of maturity and dark tone that we have seen in the last few films, while also adding in his own scores was amazing. \"Lily's Theme\" and \"Severus and Lily\" are two that I enjoyed because of the pure brilliance and understanding of the films dramatic themes, the music fit perfectly. The action and visuals are just stunning. They went all-out in this without getting infected with creativity overload. Everything seemed reasonable. The action is heart-pounding, with the last hour of the film being exactly what everyone has been waiting for. A wizard war. The great thing is, is that they still maintain the character's emotional predicaments as everything is being blown up. The final sequence between Voldemort and Harry Potter is shockingly under-played, after such a flashy battle. But, I ended up loving how they handled the final duel and created a concluding tone with such sedulity. Now, the acting. Daniel Radcliffe brings everything he has to the role. The emotional weight he carries is so well-performed and he never looks generic or over-played. The suffering in his heart was conveyed simply with emotion and we understood exactly how he felt without him having to say it. Maggie Smith and Ralph Fiennes are all good. Everyone but that Luna girl is good. She just had an obnoxious attitude towards everything. That monotone and that she always has a half-assed smile on her face was irritating and I didn't even care about her. The character conclusions are just so enthralling and immersive. But, the show-stealer here was Alan Rickman as Severus Snape. Snape's conclusion was so beautifully handled by David Yates and Rickman performed with Oscar-winning material. He showed a side of Snape and concluded him in under twelve minutes of screen time, without it seeming rushed. He was brilliant and the wonderfully edited memories of Snape that reveal all the secrets about Harry and Snape was just epic. The film really succeeded in wrapping everything up in just a pure an epic experience. The cinematography and art direction was great and everything was perfect. This is the best and final installment of the Harry Potter franchise.",

One prime example that summarizes this is the famed Voldemort and Draco reunion that's infamous for being one of the most \"awkward film moments.\" That coupled with the Voldemort-Potter fight scene along with some other parts just made it was too cheesy.

Ms Emma Watson whose career will probably reach the greatest of heights (i.e. being completely ignored by the Oscar Awards Ceremony) despite her Director's \"courage\") to a tertiary character. \n\nHe had the courage to make millions of dollars at the expense of what could have been a great film had he actually done what pretty much every other Director of Harry Potter films did- recreate the book to the best of their abilities. \n\nHow wonderful it is to see a Producer finally throw out with such confidence the essence of one of the most brilliantly written conclusions to a successful series of novels.\n\nCourage.

Therefore, what I can speak of about this movie, is strictly within that context - if viewed as the end of the seventh installment of the franchise, it composes a furiously intense film. While it is a shame that we couldn't have the two parts be released together, the film, and the franchise, ultimately benefits from it. \nThe films compliment each other, while at the same time being very different. The first part was very deliberately paced, allowing us time with the characters the previous films could not afford. The second film is stripped of any fat, it is wall-to-wall climax. As the characters race through the plot, the filmmakers do a great job of keeping clarity where it could so easily have been lost. This is accomplished through focus and self-restraint. The director, David Yates, avoids gracefully the trap of shaky-cam, although the camera is far from static. \nThe characters' motivations are carried over entirely from Part I. Part I picks up ends on a note of barely surviving. Part II picks up the story on the burst of decisiveness characteristic of the third act. While the movie isn't all about winning, even the losses somehow seem like victories due to the way the film is written. The secondary characters do not go a moment without a small act of defiance, building towards the inevitable last stand. \nIn all these ways, the film is brilliant. I would go as far as naming it the feel-good movie of the year. What would no doubt be flaws anywhere else, The Deathly Hallows manages to balance with an energy that carries us through. There is no deep message, christian overtones aside, conveyed here. The arc the characters undergo is quite shallow, with only minimal inward conflict. But it is an event, and I am glad I was there when It All Ended.",

I think that this will be the time that \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part 2\" should get an Academy Award for Best Picture against The Help, The Artist, The Descendants, or Shame, or any movie.

This movie seems to try harder than before to make sure you feel the characters', Hogwarts', and even the enemy's mortality- the filmmakers dispense with most of the incantations, Harry and his friends wear entirely Muggle clothing, and our beloved Hogwarts shatters into rubble with each missed spell. If you've watched and read the movies and books that came before it, you will find a deeply rewarding conclusion to one of the largest movie franchises ever made in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part Two.",

I had a few very definite preconceptions about how certain events would unfold and when they didn't play out how I had imagined them I ended up being disappointed and distracted.  presumably I won't have this issue during the second viewing as I will know precisely what is coming and simply be able to sit back and the enjoy the film as an entity separate from the novel (a film adaptation).  I certainly imagine this has the possibility of getting bumped up to 3.5 stars.  The visuals are stupendous; the pace is rapid, yet slow enough at key moments that we are allowed to catch our breath; the performances just keep getting better (although I was disappointed that Fiennes never really gets his chance to shine; I felt like his character needed what Snape finally got here); the music, costume, sound, set, location design, etc are all absolutely top notch; etc.  Part of the problem is that the novel was much more deeply satisfying for me, so it was hard for the film to live up to my expectations the first time around.  Here's hoping I'll be able to forgive the pictures minor faults (not enough time for Voldemort, the final duel didn't play out as it did in the novel, the reaction to the death is a bit muted/surprising, even if it was I'm sure very consciously done this way, Ginny and Harry don't work all that well, the ending isn't as poignant as I was hoping for, especially when I compare it to similar films like The Return of the King, etc) the next time around.",

It's well paced, relatively accurate to the book, and still manages to inject a few zingers from Ron, Neville, and Seamus.\n\nThere are one or two scenes that feel off pace or... off color, but that's picking for picking's sake. For a decade long film series, it has stayed surprisingly fresh and new.

WELL DONE! now the performances....daniel radcliffe will ALWAYS be Harry Potter. he really matured as an actor, even though he wasn't the best in the first three films. radcliffe carried the film with his best performance yet. rupert grint and emma watson have really matured as well, and they have a bright future ahead of them. eight films in ten years with these three young actors as the lead. it has been a long and worthwhile journey seeing them as the characters. it was like i was growing up with them. that's one of the reasons why i teared up at the end. the veteran actors were an absolute joy. to me, alan rickman was the biggest standout. see the movie to see why, but all the previous films, he really IS professor snape. no one else could have played the role as well as he did with such calmness and empathy. brilliant actor. ralph fiennes can only be a villain in films and he-who-must-not-be-named was one of his best roles. in this film, he gets a lot more screentime than any of the previous films combined and he expresses the amount of evil you-know-who possesses in rowling's novel. the casting director made an excellent choice. julie walters and maggie smith were big standouts as well, as they are always. as for the young actors, a real scene stealer was matthew lewis as neville longbottom. he really came a long way as the character and as an actor. his role in the film is crucial and he really demonstrates that after the first films characterizing him as a coward and klutz. long career ahead of him! the entire ensemble of actors in the harry potter series deserve an award for their dedication to an eight film series over a span of ten years! never forget! \r\nthe visuals and action scenes are an adrenaline rush, because it is so exciting and heartbreaking to see what happens in rowling's novel from the eyes and mind of david yates. a school that my generation read about and saw with our own eyes becomes a warzone. it's really intense! i will also say, this is the DARKEST harry potter film. so small children should not see this movie, because some sequences were hard to watch. this is a film i will never forget, and a franchise i will always cherish throughout my life. it's so hard to realize that the films are over, because i grew up with them. i was 10 when the sorcerer's stone came out, and now i'm 20. to fans of the series, you will be astonished and impressed with this film. to those who never liked the series, DON'T BOTHER. i am fan of the series and proud of it. the books and films of harry potter will always be in my heart.",

The magic and mystery kind of drifts along in the background, milling in and out of the storyline. The portrayal of characters by the entire cast is at its absolute best, with the revered Maggie Smith surprisingly delivering the most funny, powerful scenes. \n\nThough a mass of deviations from its origins litter the plot, it has only a positive impact. Avid JK Rowling readers may nit pick at the chops and changes, but upon reflection, it provides a host of welcome surprises and makes for a better viewing experience.\n\nAll I can say now is that I'm almost baiting my breathe for the possibility of a future addition. Though no new books have been touted, it's been a part of my entire childhood, from written word to the screen. \n\nLike many others, I just don't want it to end...",

Having say this the story still does not quite make it without the acting and the action the story would have not make it.many time in the movie you don't understand why and how .You just keep following the actors from place to place and the movie'story itself seems far from the title and its importance for the actual story After being blow away by the special effect the awesome world and the good acting everything fades away.Many time it s not necessary to know everything in the original story to make a good adaptation but the main track and logic should remain and the purpose of the story kept. Here you lose your mind only those who read the story can actually love it and keep track or those who don t care about the common sens.I know it for being fantasy but even so a story though has to make enough sens especially harry potter.It remains a good show but nothing unforgettable. We are far from the actual awesome quality of the book which is far more exiting and better or in the same category movies such as lord of the rings and star wars.In my opinion this movie is only for fan and i m too smart to act like one for this last part of harry potter's movies.Nothing memorable.",

            "content": "The end is here. It almost impossible to believe that a series I was in the mix with at the very beginning has new meaning to me over the past ten years. I am not a Harry Potter fan, because I don't get into it like the millions of Potter fans out there do. I am however a film buff. I've grown to love and connect  with the film's characters, a group of lovable misfits and daredevils that it is now sad to imagine another Christmas or summer without them.\n\nLet me start by recapping the Harry Potter films.There was never a Potter film that I did not like, they have all earned a three star rating and some a three and half and even a four star rating. The 1st Potter film in my eyes is still the weakest of them all, which made it difficult to jump on broad the Potter series right away. However, you can't skip one of these films, even the 1st film is vital to the whole Harry Potter story which is why I still enjoy the film. It wasn't until \"The Chamber of Secrets\" when I saw the direction the series was heading, and the possibility of it being great fun and a well worth wild franchise. \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" continued to surprise me with the series stepping into darker waters while still being a kid friendly film. Then came \"Goblet of Fire\", the HP film that I went head over heels for. I still love \"Goblet of Fire\" very much. It is an excellent portrayal of the turn of events in the series and change in the film's characters. It is the point of the series where characters start drifting away from childhood and begin to enter into a more coming of age. \"Order of the Phoenix\" was a step down in the Potter films in my book. Still a good film, but it was a difficult challenge to top HP3 and especially HP4. One major problem I had with the film is that it is the only Potter film to not be penned by screenwriter Steve Kloves, and I could instantly see that in the film's structure. It was also the first Potter film to be directed by David Yates who I wasn't very thrilled with right away after seeing \"Phoenix\", but like I said I still enjoyed the film for what it had to offer. \"Half-Blood Prince\" was a step up for me with David Yates, however I still was not convinced with him being the final director, nor was I convinced that HP would ever again reach the level of greatness I saw in \"Goblet of Fire\". Then came \"The Deathly Hallows: Part 1\", a film I walked into with mild expectations, and I was blown right out of my mind with. It was the best Potter film I had seen, and was one of the top 5 best films of the year! \"Deathly Hallows: Part 1\" is a complete and total breakaway from the normal Potter story formal, which I absolutely loved! Suspenseful, thrilling with the characters in their strongest portrayals. To me I love the do-or-die build up in a series. The moments where things feel like they are collapsing with no possibility of hope in sight. Most film series with the same continuing story have these moments, \"The Lord of The Rings\", \"Star Wars\", \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", even \"The Matrix trilogy\". \"The Deathly Hallows: Part 1\" was done to almost pure perfection.   \n   \nNow we come to \"Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 2\", a finale I was already walking into with high expectations, thanks to \"Deathly Hallows: Part 1\". My expectations were met. The cinema magic of \"The Deathly Hallows\" is that while each part is only half of it's book source. They truly feel as if each one were based on a whole book. \n\n\"The Deathly Hallows: Part 2\" picks up immediately following the tragic end of \"Part 1\" and before the audience knows it we are heading straight into the battle for Hogwarts, where anything goes and anyone can die. Harry and his dearest friends continue their quest to find and destroy Voldemort's horcrux's, which is the only way to destroy the dark lord once and for all. A quest which is constantly met with pain, suffering, and hardship, but also strengthen and friendship. \"The Deathly Hallows: Part1\" was an excellent portrayal of the three main characters coming together and laying down their lives (as usual) to fight this final battle. \"The Deathly Hallows: Part 2\" is an excellent portrayal of everyone laying down their lives to come together to fight evil. We see characters and even places that we haven't seen since the first two films, and here we are on HP7: Part 2. There is no need for introductions or reminders of what these places are what happened at these locations to make them important. Having seen all the previous Potter films, I knew and remember all the locations and characters and was thrilled to be back in places that I though I would never revisit and to see characters I hadn't seen in a long time. That is why it is crucial to see all the films in this series, and in order. \n\nDavid Yates once again has me convinced that he was truly ideal to film the this final chapter in the Harry Potter series. With dazzling special effects, outstanding cinematography from Eduardo Serra, another beautiful film score from Alexandre Desplat, and once more a final great job of Steve Kloves in adapting J.K. Rowling's novel to film, especially this time. The strongest point in the whole film once again isn't in it's action or it's showdown, it's in the scene of showing the all the vital connections that where leading to this final conclusion. Connections made all the way to the very beginning of the series and along the way.   \n\nWhat marked the Harry Potter series so special to me was that when you walked into a new film you already knew the characters, minus the new ones of that story. These are characters that we have grown side-by-side with for ten years. Now it is time to find a new set of characters to grow along side with. Something I don't see happening for quite some time, and that is why so many are so sad to see the franchise come to an end. At least in my eyes that's why.\n\n\"Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 2\" is a beautiful and wonderful franchise film, bringing a sad and a very emotional closure to a group of characters we have loved and related to for the past decade. It is the final bow of an amazing and very talented cast of actors and actress, as well as an amazing film crew. I do admit that \"Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 1\" is still my favorite. However, \"The Deathly Hallows Part 2\" is more than I could ever ask and look for in a film franchise's conclusion. This is one of the year's best films, and one of the best final conclusions to a franchise I have ever seen!",

The plot finally gets simplified once all those silly magic items are found, and what we have is a war at the Hogwarts School of Magic between good vs. evil. The action sequences are the best in the film's series and some very dark events take place, including the deaths of many characters, some children, though too many critical deaths occur off camera. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) faces off against Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) for the fate of the world, and after the protracted, wearisome setup of Part One, it's a relief to say that the final film moves like it's on fire. There's very little downtime and a great pull of urgency to the flick. So what if Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson), Harry's best pals since the start, are completely forgotten and useless in the movie's final hour. The focus is all on Harry and his messianic sacrifices. Alan Rickman shines again, showing a depth of emotions not available to Snape until the character's final revelations. In fact, there needed to be more Rickman, but I can lay this same charge with every film. I wish the resolution, spanning forward 19 years, would have slowed down a bit and accept the paternal/maternal changing-of-the-guard as the emotional payoff billions of people have been waiting for. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two is a thrilling, gratifying capper to a series that, while to me was never as magical as the Potter die-hards have claimed, was, over eight movies and almost 20 hours, an enchanting franchise that stayed consistent in quality and entertainment. Here's to you, Potter. Now maybe I can finally stop hearing people badgering me about how the books were better. \r\n\r\nNate's Grade: B+",

In fact it's a good one it's just that the emotional build-up created through the isolation felt in Part 1, here, is left behind rather quickly and the clever subtext of fanaticism explored within the novels is left understudied.  The cast is strong with Rickman the standout.  He brings his Snape to such a satisfactory emotional conclusion here that his last minutes on screen, depicted so tellingly through that baleful stare, wring such feelings of endearment that it's a shame his work can't be considered for awards consideration from the very first film all the way through to the eighth's conclusion.  The visual effects are good without being mindblowing and the score once again quite beautiful but they're all outshone by Eduardo Serra's glorious camerawork.  It's a satisfying enough conclusion to the film franchise that doesn't quite meet the expectations one may have been led to establish after watching film number seven.  In retrospect it's a shame Cuaron wasn't on board for the series' duration.  He'd have found a way to get right to the heart of the matter, which in its simplest form was always to see Harry's tale handled well and faithfully.",

I need to read the book, I guess, which is kind of dumb. I mean, shouldn't the movie be able to stand on it's own? I doubt I'd need to read The Godfather in order to notice the subtleties of Coppola's film, and that's what's keeping this one from being the 5-star film it almost is. Also, in a personal peeve, I hate the CGI ghost. All the other ghosts in the first movies were physical actors, who were then made blue and translucent. I get that CGI is so much better now and that it's probably cheaper to just digitize her than go through the old process, but not only does it make her inconsistent with Nearly Headless Nick and the like, but she looks fake. CGI never looks as real as an actual actor, no matter how hard we keep trying to convince ourselves otherwise.",

The four directors gave us 10 years of excitement and allowed us to join Harry on his epic journey through life and death, and love and loss. Dan, Rupert, and Emma give their best performances at the end, as does the rest of the cast. Fiennes is at his most dark, and Rickman brings a long-overdue tear to the Half-Blood Prince's revelation. My only suggestion, not criticism, is to watch parts I and II together. The long journey is still only one year for Harry. And you'll realize the full emotional toll that the wizarding world, especially Harry, endures. I have watched it over and over again, and I still feel like I want to return to platform 9 & 3/4 next year. Mischief Managed!",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is the final adventure in the Harry Potter film series. After seven previous movies reaching back an entire decade the Harry Potter series has reached a solid and satisfying end. It was such a good idea to split the last book into to movies. If you are a big fan of the books as I am, you could arguably say that all the movies could have been made into two parts. As good as that might have been, that would have been far to many movies. The final book however has so much in it that one movie could not have done it proper justice. Before going to see the movie I would pop Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 in your DVD player, because if you are not up to speed on what is happening you will be completely lost. I saw the first part the same day I went to go and see the second part. I kind of wish that they had gone with a 4 and a half hour epic. I imagine that most people wouldn't sit through a movie that long though. Probably only die hard Harry Potter fans such as myself would sit through that.\r\n\r\nThe story picks up right where the last one ended. We open with Harry, Ron, and Hermoine at Bill and Fleur's after narrowly escaping from Malfoy Manor. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine continue searching for Horucruxes as Voldemort becomes even stronger. Voldemort has completely taken over Hogwarts and the school is desperately trying to defend themselves, even with Snape as Headmaster and Dementors everywhere in the grounds. When they discover there is a Horocrux inside the school, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine must secretly get inside the school to find and destroy it. This will be difficult considering that Snape and the Death Eaters are searching for him. If they can find a way into Hogwarts, they will have to figure out a way to defeat Voldemort once and for all. The stakes have never been higher.\r\n\r\nThese two movies are really one, and they work best as a whole. This part didn't have or need much development because the first part had already set everything up. But standing alone they are still good movies. The first part was more of a atmospheric feel. With a big bulk of it showing the isolation between the trio. This second part is more of a fast paced and action filled movie. Still, this movie is just as emotional and equally great as the first part was.\r\n\r\nDaniel Radcliffe is great. This is one of the best performance he has given in the entire series. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are great as well. They have great on screen chemistry together. It has always been really strong in the other movies, but in this one they have just a little extra. We have seen the trio grow up on screen, and there acting has improved so much since the first Harry Potter movie. Matthew Lewis is also really good as Neville. Neville finally gets his moment in the sun. The Harry Potter movies have always had a strong supporting cast as well. British Legends Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Micheal Gambon, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, and more. They never get as much screen time as the trio, and they have to share the screen with so many other British Legends. But they are all so great in there roles. Maggie Smith gets her screen time bummed up from her usual one. She shine brightly as Professor McGonagall. Helena Bonham Carter however gets her screen time deluded. She is still good, we just don't see as much of her in this one. Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes are the best out of the cast. Ralph Fiennes is a perfect Voldemort. All of his lines sound convincing, and he is just so evil. Alan Richman has been consistently good in all the Harry Potter movies. After this movie though you can look back at the greatness of his character. Snape is a very complex character, and Rickman plays him to perfection. Overall, all the actors were cast perfectly, and they were all great.\r\n\r\nJust like the other Harry potter movies this one has a fantastic score, art direction, cinematography, costumes, and special effects. The big battle of Hogworts is really great watch. There are many other memorable scenes too. I would not see the movie in 3D. It is not that bad, but it doesn't add anything to the experience. Plus, the movie is dark for the most part and the 3D makes it even darker. The script is given proper care. For a 2 hour movie the dialog is not rushed. Well it is really a 4 and a half hour movie in two parts. Since I am such a big fan of the books, I have a few minor nitpicks here and there. But they are small ones that don't hurt the movie that much.\r\n\r\nThe Harry Potter movie have had a few directors, but I can say that David Yates is the best. He did a great job on the Harry Potter movies he did. I am sad to see the movies end. At least I can still re watch them. This movie has been compared to the last Lord of the Rings movie. If you put both parts together than it is slightly better. None of the other Potter movies have gotten any Oscars, it's time they did. It deserves a best picture nomination , along with a supporting actor nomination. It also deserves one for the score, art directing, visually effects, makeup, cinematography, sound editing, and maybe director. Have to wait till the years up to see the competition. The Harry Potter series deserves many Oscars. We have really grown to love these characters. This was the proper send off to this magical series.",

You expect me to take this film seriously, I don't think so.  Then they don't check to see if Harry's dead so off they go to Hogwarts to say, \" Look Harry Potter's dead.  Join us or die! Ha Ha Ha!!!  Then Harry Potter comes to life and then all the bad guys suddenly decide to run off. Its like Harry Potter's alive run for the hills!!!  Why I have no idea I mean Harry Potter was alive when they were attacking the castle but they didn't run off then.  So dumb storytelling and filmmaking.  So Harry and Voldemort duke it out with their wands enough said right.  Now remember at the beginning they say we have to destroy all the horcruxes or whatever their called, and then kill Voldemort.  They definitely don't say, \"All you have to do to kill Voldemort is shoot his wand out of his hand with your wand and then he'll just disintergrate.\"  Yeah they don't say that because that would be stupid and everybody would laugh.  Well that's what happens in the movie so again another fail by the moviemakers.  Its like what am I watching here The Wizard of Oz.  Another thing why does Voldemort look like one of those guys from Star Trek Insurrection.  Like was he badly burned in a fire or something.  I think his plastic surgeon could have done a better job.

Things that you overlooked end up being really important, and everyone is tested in this movie This causes some characters to rise to the challenge and others to buckle, and the characters have a new power to completely surprise the audience. There comes a definite point where Harry stops being afraid of Voldemort, and it's delicious to see. Deathly Hallows 2 also never fails to make me cry, particularly in the scene where you finally get to see Snape. This is a really intense movie: it's the final chapter where everything boils over and ends, and the very end almost seems to small to be worthy of the opus as a whole. Just as an aside, I really wish they hadn't filmed and included the epilogue. It's completely unnecessary and I think it takes a little away from the core story. But whatever.

Anyway. I'm not going to whine about certain alterations/omissions of the story but I must say that Bellatrix's and Voldemort's death (where they both ... turn into confetti?) was an epic fail! However, I loved the part where we see Snape's memories. It was a really touching scene. As for the acting, Alan Rickman definitely steals the show! He's simply amazing. Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes also stand out as well as Maggie Smith. I was never a big fan of the trio's acting so yeah... I don't think that their acting was anything special... Overall, I pretty much enjoyed the film yet it left me greatly disappointed since I think that the last book had such a potential to turn into an amazing movie and ...it simply didn't.

Man the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows- Part 2 was such a remarkable experience. All the actors were all geared up for the end, showing extravagant and newly grown talent, especially from the three we know most. Such a relief to see how satisfying this turned out to be, making Part 1 seem like a warm up. \n\nThe beginning has kind of a slow start, picking up from the last scene in Part 1. But suddenly it shoots right into the action when in the bank corridor. The most pleasing acting would have to be from Radcliffe and Rickman, but you should find that almost all the supporting actors played their part really well. What also pleased me was the return of John William's delighted and recognized film scores from the first three. I guess the battle scene came a little quick for me, but it was the battle scene that made the movie so great and stirring. I thought it was actually as visually effected as Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's \"Children of Men,\" and even close to Steven Speilberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\". Trust me, if you haven't read the book and even if you already did, the action and suspense will nearly kill you. \n\nDavid Yates has never been my favorite for his Harry Potter sequels, but his last shot with the Deathly Hollows is his finest. He carefully finished up the series with major respect for the book, and I think it couldn't be done any better. Daniel Radcliffe's acting has never been done more effectively and his work would probably be remembered as his best. Most likely Rickman's finest as well, showing off his talent towards the middle of the film. Other great actors helped the whole thing keep going, like Michael Gambon, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Ralph Fiennes, and possibly the rest. Fiennes plays an outstanding voldemort, He gives his character a more realistic personality than other sequels.\n\nI don't really get why The Deathly Hollows was split, I would best think of it as one, because part 1 had to have more in it. Thats why I think Part 2 is much better, because I think it covered most of the main parts. I guess it was a good idea, to keep the series going and to have an extra movie just for a quick buck. Besides that, Deathly Hollows exceeds to be one of the best of Harry Potter's Journey. With a perfect book to back it up, it holds one of the best characters and story you'll ever get out of cinema.\n\nProfessor Severus Snape: No one can know. \nProfessor Albus Dumbledore: I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus.\n\nWell-known scenes:\n -When Harry, Ron, and Hermione run and defend themselves in the Hogwart's courtyard, amazing visual effects are seen, showing trolls, Giant spiders, and much more with powerful music in the background.\n -Battle Finale (Potter vs. Voldemort)\n -\"19 years later\"\n\nActors to watch out for- Daniel Radcliffe, Alan Rickman, and Ralph Fiennes.",

I was actually able to take the scenes I pictured and see it projected onto real life. The movie struck at the heart strings. I cried at every death, laughed at every Death Eater downfall-especially Molly Weasley's now famous line as she kills Bellatrix-, and cheered when Neville finally showed off his Gryffindor bravery. The only aspect I wasn't a fan of was the beginning of the duel between Harry and Voldemort. It seemed a little over-dramatic and not as epic as the Dumbledore/Voldemort duel. Personally, I would have liked it to be more of a spell battle rather than a flying through the air as Voldemort tries to share Harry off his back.

This entry of the Deathly Hallows is better than Part 1, it has everything you want in a Potter film, and not only is it the end of an era, but a huge part of my life has ended.  Daniel Radcliffe is amazing, the best acting he has done in the whole series, and I felt like I could see in his eyes that he would miss the movies, and we would miss him.  Rupert Grint is great with his screentime, he is emotional, and brave as he ends his role as Ron Weasley.  Emma Watson truly emraces her final hours as Hermoine Granger, and I felt like we will miss her just as much as Danie and Rupert.  Alan Rickman was always just good in these movies, but after this movie, I look back at the greatness of his character, the emotion, the genius, and finally the love of his character.  Ralph Fiennes was the only person in the world who could've played Voldemort, and he plays it so well that I smiled at how evil he was, and how I realized that he was a permanent part of the Potter universe.  Overall I thought the acting was great, and Mathew Lewis has some of the best moments as his final hours as Neville Longbottom are a lines of genius.  While J.K Rowling is truly a remarkable author, David Yates was able to show us his knowledge of this tremendous series, of how he feels the same loss we feel, and how we will forever miss the series.  The plot is a genious, it brings back great moments and people from past movies and makes it feel awesome to be a Harry Potter fan, because you have waited and the moment of truth has come for all your answers, and if you have a piece of your heart in the series like I do, you will cry as the final moments of the film happen.  The special effects are again, the best in the series, we are shown thing that have never been done in film history, the film was so genius in fact that I would dare to say Avatar has a run for its money, just saying, and I think its tied with Inception for me as the best special effects I have ever seen.  This movie provided me with every single bit of my musical expectations, in other words they had one of the greatest scores you will ever hear, and it even brought back some of our favorite melodies from past films.  The production was great, you can totally tell they went all out to make this a grand finale.  10 years ago, my mother took me to see Sorcerers Stone and I was a kid, and I instantly fell in love with the movie.  Then more films came out and I was a complete die hard fan of the series, then when this came out I went with my family and we loved every second of it, and when it ended, I cried and then left the theater, but I know Harry Potter will be in my life forever, and im happy to say that it will be in others hearts too.

Almost every single member of the titular hero's army is someone we know, someone named, someone who has been explored in the books at least, if not the films. Even those that don't, they're still people that the goodies have been to lessons with, or seen in the Ministry of Magic. That is why there is so much emotional resonance in this film, and that is what makes us care when these characters are being mown down in battle by curses and hexes and spells. Even when characters like Lavender, whom was one of the most annoying people in the franchise, die, you still feel sad to see them go. But in the end, whether through death or otherwise, every single one of those characters ends here. The poignant final scene, which harkens back to the first film so wonderfully, bookends this perfectly - After all, it ends where it all began.",

After such long series of movies one would think it invoked strong feelings but Harry Potter's last stand is just another mediocre blockbuster.\n\nDavid Yates continues true to his directing style with Deathly Hallows 2 by mixing childish fantasy with dark settings and ominous CGI visuals. The mixture of these has never been my cup of tea and turns many scenes into something unreal and ridiculous. I mean, teenagers shooting beams of computer imaginary from wooden sticks at horrendous monsters is just not my idea of epic fantasy! And what is wrong with Mr. Potter; the worlds greatest wizards still looks stunned and is under performing when his annoying sidekicks pull meaningless spells and somehow manage to save the day.  \n\nIt is however not all bad (just most of it), the last Harry Potter manages to accomplish closure for the saga and for that it earns some points. For a very long time in Potter flicks there is now some occurrences in Deathly Hallows part 2 with clear consequences. The great evil is confronted and ultimately defeated. It took 8 movies but at last there is something concrete happening story wise. It does not fix the the whole series but Deathly Hallows Part 2 at least managed to keep me semi interested for the most part of the movie which can be accounted as credit for the movie.",

She is a much better story teller than writer. Deathly hallows part 2 is full of cgi but runs circles around movies like transformers. The scene at gringots was one that should go down in history. Goblet of Fire will always be my favorite because the concept was so interesting and i really felt that voldemort was a threat at the end. But this comes close behind. We got our epic finally, I'm sure most people could have sat through a 4 hour finale because of how endearing the series has become, sadly it's all over. And the movie can't save j.k.'s awful ending.

The series finally concludes with Deathly Hollows Part 2 and, sadly, also finally achieves the dramatic strength which has been lacking for the last 7 1/2 movies. A little too late as a series to be sure but, at least the climactic flick isn't a chore to sit through like some of the others.The cast is fine, though the cast was never the problem for me, it was the scripts and direction that neutered most of them. But, as for this final chapter, let's not hand out any awards just yet. Hallows Part 2's script is still a bit muddled. I have seen all the Potter flicks and still have a hard time following what's going on (never read the books). And of course it contains dramatic strength, it's based on the second half of a climactic book so, it contains all the dramatic scenes and action. So in that sense it's kind of cheating. The FX during the numerous scenes of spectacle range from very good to cheesy. I was never enamored with the CGI in these films and this one is no different. There is a lot of action but, some of it reminds me of the confusing clutter that plagued the climax of Return of The Jedi. You really can't tell what's going on at times. The action only really flows when it focuses on intimate conflict between smaller groups of characters or the individual struggles with Harry and Voldemort. Another thing that's always annoyed me is that I'll never understand why the characters use their wands for some things but then struggle to accomplish other tasks on their own. It seems to me like a script contrivance to create drama. So, to a non-fan like me it is one of the better of the series, maybe the best but, when a series takes 7 1/2 movies to really get going, that's not something to wave your wand about.",

Well I actually have to admit that this movie is pretty damn sweet and well worth the 130 minutes you'll have to spend with it. The story was probably the only problem with this movie, it has been quite a while since I last watched the final movies, so my memories of it were pretty vague and that made some of the plot twists very hard to follow.\n\nAside from that it is just as spectacular as you may expect from a triple-A movie. There are epic scenes with hundreds of actors firing special effects into the sky at the same time and the whole story is carried by top notch actors who spend ten years working themselves into this role. Since part 1 was nice enough to take up the entire first and second act, this movie is a well supported third act that never seems to end, it just jumps from one amazing moment to the other and most of the sideplots that started tying up got a tear lose in me. A recommendation for the Harry potter fans, but if you haven't followed the series this is just a confusing compilation of action scenes.",

It should have been a long, epic thing but instead they just glossed over it.  Also, it was kind of weird when Voldemort dies.  He just poofs into ashes, I'm not even completely sure why, and he doesn't even say anything.\n\nBut at least the epilogue was great.  Completely natural when Harry calls his son by saying his first, middle and last names.\n\nTo be fair this is a humungous, epic production and any director would have his hands more than full with it.

There are some scary and sad parts so I would recommend the movie for age 8 and above, if you think your child could handle mild scariness. Most impressive to me was the heartwrenching performance of Alan Rickman (Professor Snape). This is Snape as you've never seen him before. Did I forget to mention the *magic*? The best part of all. I love when Professor McGonagal summons the Knights (or suits of armor) stationed around the castle and orders them to \"Do your duty to our school!\" Very cool to see. I would wager that the Harry Potter books and movies will be revisited by generations to come. This happens to be my favorite movie of all time and I'm 42 years old and extremely picky. My daughter and I started reading the books when she was 6. Finished them when she was 9. She has since read them all twice. She is 12 years old. Ultimately, the stories are of loyalty, friendship, heroism, and overcoming all odds to have good win out over evil. Highly recommend!",

In fact, I'd argue that Rowling could have shortened the franchise quite considerably, and cut out a lot of the nonsense and shameless clich\u00c3 (C). The story, as it turns out, is really quite clever...if a little predictable. And there are some really stunning scenes. My only niggly points are: I don't think Warwick Davis should have played 2 different characters - he's too distinct an actor. And the timing of Ron and Hermione's first kiss was a bit illogical.

The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work. For all the people who were bored with the Part I this is almost all action.

            "content": "I've never been attached to the films surrounding Harry Potter and the magical realm of Hogwarts. The previous films were formulaic children's fantasy stories mixed with teenage love drama suited for high schoolers. While the latest films broke the mold some, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 was not only an excellent film, but may have elevated the series past mediocrity. For the first time in the series, the film carried some emotional weight and application that was absent in the previous films. Much like the adaptation of Return of the King, Part 2 finds a way to be a non-stop adventure film while also remaining the emotional core of the series. The scene where Harry, surrounded by his past loved ones, sacrifices himself for his friends is emotionally moving, and his resurrection and return to defeat Voldemort is a picture of the Gospel. The series has always boasted a cast of British finest actors and actress (which are too numerous to list here), but two performances specifically shine in the second part ; Ralph Fiennes' depiction of the arch villain Voldemort is a strong and elegant depiction of the Satan-like character, while the always reserved and sly \"villain\" Serous Snape (Alan Rickman) in a series of flashback scenes fills the gaps in Harry's story which not only allow Rickman to give a fleshed out performance that deserves him an Oscar nomination, but also shows how his character, since the first film, has been following a selfless ploy to help betray and defeat Voldemort. His sacrifice, as well as Harry's and the others, points not personal gain or a sense of greater good, but to follow a demand to do simply what is right. As Neville defiantly tells Voldemort, when all hope seems to be lost, that he and his friends will not die in vain. \"But you will,\" he says, \"because you're wrong.\" Perhaps the books are better and perhaps it isn't worth the 16-plus hours to get to this film. However, the final installment of Harry Potter does capture the importance of self-sacrifice and bravery in the face of reckless evil. For that, it is a magical experience.",

Literally, just over 2 hours of pure action, something which in other films can get annoying because there is no explanation but we have had 7 films of building up the tension beforehand. David Yates, in my opinion, managed to brilliantly weave in the heartfelt parts and there was no akwardness. As for the actors. FAN-BLOODY-TASTIC! How do I begin? Daniel, Emma, Rupert were amazing but I think the real stars here are Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Matt Lewis. Matt, usually a background character with Neville, was superb. He was perfect in portraying Neville and convincing us of his 'love' to Luna. Maggie Smith was amazing too. Miverna is one of my favourite characters especially in the Deathly Hallows and she really did her justice along with Julie Walters. As for Alan Rickman, if he is not nominated for an Oscar, then I officially declare the world blind. One of my favourtie parts of the book is Snapes memories, and when I found out before the film came out that Yates had tweaked it a bit I was furious, but really, it was for the better. I don't generally cry at film adaptations of books purely on the basis that no film can capture the essence of the book but I am not ashamed to say I cried like a baby. Overall, an amazing film, amazing acting, the special effects too, but above all... The. Best. Sendoff. Ever. A magnificent ending to the best franchise on Earth. Well done.",

Growing up I thought the movies would never end......\nThen they did.\nAnd I couldn't have asked for a better send off.\nDaniel, Rupert and Emma threw themselves into the role to make it the best portrayal of the main characters in all of the film series. Though, Harry and Ginny are of course undeniably awkward, Ron and Hermione had great on screen chemistry.\nDid they miss out anything? Yes. They didn't explain the misconception of Dumbledore? No. But did they make the 'heaven' scene that confused the heck out of most of us the books a hell of a lot more understandable? Yes.\nMy personal favorite part of the movie, Snape's death.

            "content": "Excellent and satisfying conclusion to the Harry Potter series. The series will always have a soft spot in my heart, even if it is small. The first Potter book was the first book I read from cover to cover when I was a young lad and I've seen every movie in the series with the exception of the 5th one. Every movie, at least of those that I've seen, has been good to excellent with the first two movies being the weakest. I felt that with the last three movies, the series really came into its own, as far as standing out on its own and not just relying on the fame of the name. Granted the name helped, but I think the last three movies being so good helped earn the movies some respect from people who may not have bothered otherwise. The storytelling improved, the acting improved, the visuals improved. Everything improved on a massive scale and that was really noticeable, at least to me, with these last three movies. So here with this last movie, we say goodbye to one of the most successful franchises in film history and boy does it go out with a bang. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't start out that way. It starts a bit slow and it feels like it was a left over from Deathly Hallows Part 1 tacked on at the beginning of this movie to make the movie longer. This is a minor complaint, because once the movie gets going, it really doesn't stop until its climax. As mentioned in my review for Deathly Hallows 1, I thought, when WB originally announced this splitting the last book into two movies, that it was mostly just greed on their part as the last book isn't even the longest book in the series. But having seen the first installment and seeing just how that movie built anticipation for this installment and how this movie paid it all off was nothing short of brilliant. I still think it was a matter of making more money, but you couldn't find a better way to end the series than with this movie. It just flowed perfectly. The movie was just excellent. The acting from the main cast (this being Daniel, Rupert, and Emma) has improved so much from the beginning and since they were never exchanged when they got older than they were supposed to be in the book, it felt like there was a real friendship between the two and I think this movie encapsulates that perfectly. In fact, the last scene at the Hogwarts castle...of Harry, Ron and Hermione holding hands and just standing there was the absolute perfect ending for the movie. I'd have much preferred this ending than to what they did *SPOILERS*, which is show them 19 years later, leaving their kids at the train station that takes them to Hogwarts. I get what they were trying to do, but it felt kind of hokey to me. The perfect ending was them holding hands at the castle and the movie ending. They were successful in destroying Voldemort but it was a very poignant moment and I think that would've, to me at least, made for a great ending. They were successful in defeating the villain but now what does their future hold...that kind of thing. Maybe it's just me, but I preferred that. Some of the scenes are also WAY too dark sometimes It's really very minor complaints in the big picture, when the movie is as dazzling and as satisfying in closing out a film series as I've ever seen. Trust me the complaints are minor, but again...I can't say enough good things about this movie. Very highly recommended.\n\nWhich brings me to this OTHER franchise whose last book is being split into two movies, Twilight. I haven't seen Breaking Dawn yet, I don't plan on going to theaters to watch it, but from what I've heard it's a pretty terrible movie, other than to the fans. This is exactly what I said in my Deathly Hallows 1 review, not every series can pull this off and I thought that Twilight doing this was just a recipe for disaster. The books are very poorly written, I've tried to read them...I can't. So you take this poorly written book and you make a movie out of it...fine, maybe you can use smoke and mirrors to distract from the real issues with writing. But you take the last book of a poorly written series and you decide you're going to split it up into two movies...that's going to expose EVERY weakness the series has tenfold and people are going to pick up on plot holes and mistakes quicker. That's just the nature of the beast. It shouldn't surprise anybody that it has been the worst reviewed of the bunch. Not to mention, at least the Potter series was building to this climactic battle between good and evil and the death of every character that died defending Harry has weight within the context of the series, it's not just ignored. Kids grew up with these characters and the characters matured along with them, so they have a REAL connection to these characters and what their outcome is. Can someone tell me what the point of Twilight is other than protecting one of the most unlikable people ever put to screen? If Bella was a real person, she'd be hated more than Kim Kardashian She's a shitty friend, she's shallow, she tried to trick Edward into having sex with her by promising that she'd marry him if he fucked her, she constantly plays Jacob and Edward against each other as she sees fit, she does absolutely nothing and people get killed for her and this has no consequences in the series. Why is she so important and why is she worth protecting? I don't know how in any way, shape, or form fans of the series can read all these books and say \"Bella's a great character.\" There's nothing people can relate to, other if they want to have this Disney fantasy of having two guys fight over her in melodramatic stories. Everyone in the Twilight universe would be so much better off if she was dead. This could also be said about Harry Potter, but see that's the difference. In Potter they actually DEAL with this and how Harry reacts to every dying for him in this battle they really shouldn't have been in. And that's why, I think, the Twilight series will find it harder to appeal to anything other than teen girls and everyone else will just be dismissive of it. I'm not trying to weigh one series against the other, well I am...but I'm not. I'm just stating my reasons why I feel the Potter series will always be infinitely better than Twilight.\n\nI hate Twilight (and not because it's romance...that's a bullshit excuse) and Death Hallows Part 2 is a tremendous movie.",

Books can take pages and pages of space to give detailed and specific information, while movies generally don't surpass a 2-3 hour time limit (\"The Matrix\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", and \"Harry Potter\" may be movies that either max this limit or exceed it), so there are certain limitations to what can be covered in a book-turned-movie. \r\n\r\nThis is not to say that this last installment of the Harry Potter series was boring or lacking in major ways.

Of course, I didn't, but now that it's all over, something feels missing. Potter was the last film series from the early 2000s to finish (the only other one before that was Shrek, and unlike the amazing first film, the sequels were crap). In our \"post-modern\" world of Glee and Jersey Shore and Twilight and Justin Bieber, there's really not a whole of of genuinely good entertainment anymore. \r\n\r\nAnyway, moving on to the film. This is the best of the Potters by far, although it is the complete opposite of the very bright and cheerful first film. Unlike the first Deathly Hallows (which was one of the worst ones, in my opinion), this one manages to combine action with story in a very thought-out way. I especially like how they dealt with Snape, a character who I always liked. In the end, Voldemort is disentegrated (he dies, tah dah), Ron and Hermione hook up (and she's looking more smoking hot than ever), and Harry saves the day. It's all a little bit depressing.

            "content": "To this point the world of Harry Potter is well known to everyone around the world, even to those who have never read the books or seen the movies, even those that are tired of hearing about the series. To many it started with the great books by J.K. Rowling, and I was one of them. However, I did not start reading the books until the third one came out, previously siding on the fence of being sick of how popular it was. But when I picked those books for the first time I was hooked for over a decade. And then the movies began to come out and I was equally transfixed by the marvelous visual telling of this instant classic tale. Sadly, the series has to come to a close some time, and for the literature side it was a few years ago, though it remains to be seen if Rowling will continue the series in any way. For the films, that day came on July 15, but with such a remarkable series, it will live on forever.\n\nThis eighth and final film in the series is actually a continuation of the previous film, so we pick up our three young heroes, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), on the trail of finding the remaining horcruxes of Voldemort (Ralph Finnes). These horcruxes must be found and destroyed before the evil wizard can be brought down in the epic finale. The team encounters countless close calls on their way to the \"Battle of Hogwarts\" which concludes the series with the entire cast of characters coming together for one last time on screen.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of the film series has been its casting, which starts with the three main actors. They have grown so much over the series and it is great to have seen them mature right in front of our eyes. None of them perhaps truly shine in this installment, but they are so comfortable in their roles as Harry, Ron and Hermione at this point that you hardly notice that they are acting. At this point they truly are these characters. But past that is the astounding supporting cast which is cock full of English acting legends, and each actor, and in fact each character, is given their moment in this concluding chapter, which I found to be a very nice touch. Alan Rickman (Snape) and Ralph Finnes (Voldemort) are the standouts in this particular film, but enough cannot be said for what the entire veteran cast brought to the entire series.\n\n And Rickman is really important in this installment because Snape is such an important part of the story, which is adapted quite well once again by Steve Kloves. Much like the first part of The Deathly Hallows, the film appears to be pretty faithful to the book. Whatever changes or adjustments have, to this point, become almost background noise, for the filmmaking team under the direction of David Yates has become so great at creating the world of Harry Potter and making great films that whichever choices they seem to make, they always seem to be great choices, even when it differs from the source material.\n\nThe technical aspects, as always, are also astounding. The special effects, which have been somewhat of a calling card for the series, are top notch once again, taking full advantage of the many magical settings of the film as well as the epic battles and action scenes that are prevalent throughout the final chapter. The cinematography, which has become a common thread in the Yates directed films, is strong once again as director of photography Eduardo Serra captures the world in all its beauty, complete with interesting angles and framing choices. Alexandre Desplat, who has been one of Hollywood's hot composers of late, returns again for the score of this film and continues his hot streak, composing a blazing score for the film full of action, with the ability to be emotionally touching at the right points as well. And as the previous composers before him, his work is more subtle and complimentary than the great work of John Williams earlier in the series.\n\nThe film moves at a breakneck pace and really has little expository scenes, but this late in the series it almost feels like there shouldn't be. Because this is the latter half of the book, the entire film is pretty much 3rd act material, which means it is edge of your seat action from start to finish with little time to breath, but I cannot think of a better way to conclude the series. There is no way this is a stand alone film. Anyone that sees this film without seeing any of the others would be lost and would probably hate the film, but that simple fact almost makes this film that much better.\n\nThe previous films in the series have done such a great job of setting up and developing all these characters that this film not only gets away with being all 3rd act with little exposition, but it excels at it. For that reason I cannot imagine a better way to have ended the series. Everyone gets their due and their moment to shine. I would not call this the best of the series, though now that the series has concluded I am sure to resort to my style of ranking the books: why rank them, the entire series is great and magical. Harry Potter is a gift which was first given by J.K. Rowling, and since been regifted by Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell, and finally the wonderful David Yates. It will be ever present in the history of cinema as perhaps the most successful franchise both financially and artistically, but more importantly it will be in my personal collection for the rest of my life to enjoy and share with as many people as possible.",

Also, the parts of the battle scenes that were a departure from the book seemed very contrived.  And I was very disappointed by the final scene in the train station.  They could have done so much more than that, but it was like they just threw it on the end of the movie only because they knew they had to.  David Yates treated it like a throwaway scene, and it showed.  As for the positives--the main characters are really at the end of their ropes by now, and Daniel, Rupert and Emma show those emotions brilliantly.  Daniel especially does well as Harry goes to meet what he thinks is his death.  The effects during the battle for Hogwarts are breathtaking and very believable.  All in all, very poignant, very magical, very believable (if you believe in magic, that it), and a very good end to a phenomenal series.",

One of the biggest suprises was that the action in the film was constant and incredibly exciting and satisfying, and this suprised me mainly because I've never watched a Harry Potter film and even thought about the small bits of action that was in them. The film also shows how much the stars have grown as actors since they first walked through the doors of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and they all do a fantastic job in the film, because they give us the feeling that they actually have been through all of these events in the series, and the film offers satisfying, yet not always happy, conclusions to all of the characters in the series.

Part 1 slightly strayed away from the original story but I was still satisfied with the finished product. As a movie, Part 1 was good, and a great way to get the story going. As Part 2 approached, I waited with great anticipation. Cutting to the chase, I was completely blown away by this film. Again, while it doesn't retain everything in the final book, it pulls out the stops and remains a very close and faithful adaptation to my favourite book series. In fact, the film overcame some of the shortcomings that the final book suffered from. The final battle at Hogwarts seemed to be very rushed, and little description was given to how bad this war was. In the film, we truly witness the destruction of Hogwarts, and the powers that Lord Voldemort has mustered in his final attempt to kill Harry. Then there is the showdown between the Harry and the Dark Lord. In the book, I felt it was too short, failing to capitalize on the potential that an epic battle of this scale. As Dumbledore so accurately put it in the Half-Blood Prince, it would take considerable skill to defeat Voldemort even without his horcruxes. In the film, we truly witness Harry summoning all his magical skills to battle one-on-one with Voldemort, bringing the battle to a truly satisfying conclusion. All the actors did extremely well in this film, and seeing Neville Longbottom turn into a true badass was simply excellent to see. I'm sure going to miss this series but I know that they will live on forever. I recommend the books and films to everyone, you will truly be amazed.",

They included all my favorits parts of the movie, the effects were seriously epic, and for the first time Daniel Radcliffe's acting didn't put my teeth on edge. The final battle scenes didn't dissapoint too much. The prodominent dissapointing factor: the epilogue scene at the end...what the WHAT?",

            "content": "This was the single most disappointing movie I've ever seen in my life.  Much of the drama and emotion that came through in the books is completely lost in this film.  Part of the blame lies with the young actors, who have never really had any other roles besides these and for the most part, had happy silly roles to portray, up until the last few movies.  This is where their acting goes south fast, Daniel Radcliff is absolutely horrible in this movie and shows no emotion at all.  The scene where he finds out that Fred, Remus, and Tonks are all dead should have been one of the most emotional scenes in the movie, yet it goes by as if nothing happened and is quickly forgotten.  The director, Yates, must also share some of this blame for not only getting his actors to act correctly but also for putting too much emphasis on special effects.  He did to this movie what George Lucas did to the Star Wars prequels, added flash and \"excitement\" through FX but lost all the connection with the characters.  Despite the entire movie being completely disappointing in itself, the worst was the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort.  There was absolutely no feeling in it at all, just a lot of bright flashing lights, and Harry and Voldemort staring at each other.  The books had it completely different, actually realizing the effect of dialogue and its power.  Which brings me to another point, pointless and stupid deviation from the book.  One of the most powerful and shocking parts of this story is learning of Snape's true motives, and this movie completely butchers that.  I actually give credit to Yates here, fore making Alan Rickman seem like he has never acted before.  That takes true skill to make such a talented actor seem like an amateur.    All in all, I cannot believe I payed over $10 to see this atrocious movie, and if it were not for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I would probably never have faith in book-to-movie adaptations again.",

Oh, we just defeated Voldemort, but nobody act happy in the ending. How did Fred Weasley not get an on-screen death? How did anyone who hasn't read the books understand what the horcruxes were supposed to look like and the HUGE problem of finding them? There was no character development! The book had a made for movie ending, Harry and Voldemort circling each other with everyone watching in the great hall and Harry reveals how he defeated V. So what the heck was with that weird and dumb cliff-diving scene? Nobody else learns that Snape was a good guy and he was never redeemed. I understand that cuts need to be made for the big screen and I can forgive the exclusion of the Dumbledore/Aberforth back story and even leaving out the whole Percy drama...but this movie seriously was such a disappointment.

            "content": "I gotta hand it to Potter, not because this is the last installment but because it tied everything from a decade together and captured the emotion from JK Rowling's books making this everything a Harry Potter movie should be. Picking up right where Part 1 concluded, Part 2 is not afraid to dive right into the action and literally take off (on a damn dragon mind you!). While the majority of the film is 'the battle of Hogwarts' this does more than provide the incredible special effect-filled spectacular battle between wizards good and evil, but it captures the true core of the emotion from its central, beloved characters we've followed (in the film world) since 2001. From the deaths of the tragic characters to the justification of self sacrifice and triumphing over evil (I don't care how tacky it sounds), this franchise comes to a near perfect bitter sweet close for Potter and pals. Now that Part 2 is finished, this final film can be judged the way it was meant to be... two different, incredibly unique parts that make up one enormous heart-felt story. Though a controversial split, it would have been a disgrace to give Harry anything but the send off he deserves and while yes, this movie receives the \"best movie of the Summer\" award, partially as a crutch due to my long affection for Potter, I can say that this final Potter installment (both Parts 1 and 2) is far and away the most well done Potter film, as a faithful adaptation to the book and as a phenomenal film in general. Once the movie ends there's a sad yet necessary completion to the franchise. Suddenly those missing pieces are filled in and a 10 year weight is lifted off its audiences shoulders allowing every previous Potter installment to play its individual part in this building block of one of the greatest franchises of our generation. Looking back, one can appreciate all the different directors who developed each installment to their own perfection allowing every film to feel different than the last but ultimately each a bridge to the next. And with David Yates successfully developing these last 4 chapters (3 if you count Hallows as one movie), not one Potter film can be without the other and you can truly take in all the compassion for this series when these final credits roll for one last time. Its been a good run; one hell of a ride, but dammit, well done Harry. Well done.",

I think the critics took a slightly inflated liking to this just because it was very good PLUS the last movie of the series. Add to that the fact that I actually really enjoyed 7.1 and still not sure why the critics were relatively unkind to that one. The quality between the two are about the same to me.\r\n\r\nAnyway, with those caveats out of the way, it certainly was a well-crafted, very enjoyable fantasy-adventure film. I haven't read the book yet, so I'm judging it on purely filmic terms. The young cast has visibly grown in skill as much as in physical stature. The performances here are superb by all involved. In fact, I wasn't much of a fan of Radcliffe's Potter through the first, say, 5 movies, so his improvement has been especially notable. Also, a particular sequence involving Snape is the first time a Potter film brought tears to my eyes. Of course, that's because I wasn't expecting the revelation since I haven't read the series. To diehard fans it may not quite move them. I also very much disliked the epilogue; it seemed a little TOO happy and the makeup work wasn't even well-done. Still, very good escapist entertainment. Watching the movies has now induced me to read the books, by the way. So a job well done for that too.",

It is also literally so dark that I had to adjust the brightness on my TV screen.\r\n\r\nThe story plays it safe and goes for the grand confrontation involving armies on both sides. The battleground is the Hogwarts campus. The evil forces outnumber the good. The siege involves destruction, mayhem, and lots of motivation that no longer need explanation by this chapter. Supporting characters reveal new sides of themselves. And Harry finally confronts Voldemort, wand to wand.\r\n\r\nIt's a sensational film of computer effects used to depict the intensity of structures being demolished, and powerful spells being conjured. We see the main trio running away from engulfing flames, falling rubble, and they eventually ride on big broomsticks together, as all wizards should be imagined. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the brief revisit to Gringotts bank. It's interesting how the passageways to the vaults were never fully developed and instead look more like mining tunnels. And what resides deep below is quite a surprise.\r\n\r\nAfter seven successful Harry Potter movies, viewing satisfaction of the eight part can grow into weariness. But the fact remains that they are stories of a fantastic imagination.",

As much as we would love every word to come to life in the movie there is no possible way every single page can make it into the movie.

It's hard to think a movie in this series could be any worse than the Order of the Phoenix, but this movie takes the cake. It took every deep plot twist and every emotional aspect of the movie and completely downplayed it to have big computer-generated fight scenes as the main driving point. The sincerity is underwhelming and you're investment in these characters is completely dismantled when every character besides Harry and Voldemort are shoved into the corner and away from the story into the realm of minor characters. The movie is riddled with plot holes and questions left unanswered because it assumes that the audience is too overwhelmed in emotion to notice them. This is a terribly rendered and watered-down version of the book that audiences and critics should be up in arms against and brutally tearing apart, but instead I see people too caught up in the ending of something so uniquely nostalgic to them that they don't even bat an eye at all the flaws.",

I don't even understand how Rowling allowed some scenes to occur in the movie. \nLooking at this from the outside I can see why this movie is popular. It has a lot more action than the book.

Watchable but my recommendation is read the books.",

There are some missteps along the way, but the entire franchise was consistent and well made. This was a series treated with love and care, and I hope the fans treat the film the same way. We lucked out with these films, Potter fans.\r\nBut to review this particular film, there's not much to be said. Deathly Hollows shows Potter at his most mature. The tone of the film is suitably heavy handed and dark, reflecting the woes of becoming a young adult. I was reminded in a lot of ways by Link emerging from the Temple of time, being brought into a dark and threatening world, a stark contrast to the whimsy of childhood.\r\nThis is a franchise that is must see viewing for the younger crowd, but entertaining and mindful, with plenty of underlying, adult oriented content. Watch this, then watch it with your kids, and try to get them to read the books. From start to finish, Harry Potter's simply magic.",

            "content": "I've never been attached to the films surrounding Harry Potter and the magical realm of Hogwarts. The previous films were formulaic children's fantasy stories mixed with teenage love drama suited for high schoolers. While the latest films broke the mold some, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 was not only an excellent film, but may have elevated the series past mediocrity. For the first time in the series, the film carried some emotional weight and application that was absent in the previous films. Much like the adaptation of Return of the King, Part 2 finds a way to be a non-stop adventure film while also remaining the emotional core of the series. The scene where Harry, surrounded by his past loved ones, sacrifices himself for his friends is emotionally moving, and his resurrection and return to defeat Voldemort is a picture of the Gospel. The series has always boasted a cast of British finest actors and actress (which are too numerous to list here), but two performances specifically shine in the second part ; Ralph Fiennes' depiction of the arch villain Voldemort is a strong and elegant depiction of the Satan-like character, while the always reserved and sly \"villain\" Serous Snape (Alan Rickman) in a series of flashback scenes fills the gaps in Harry's story which not only allow Rickman to give a fleshed out performance that deserves him an Oscar nomination, but also shows how his character, since the first film, has been following a selfless ploy to help betray and defeat Voldemort. His sacrifice, as well as Harry's and the others, points not personal gain or a sense of greater good, but to follow a demand to do simply what is right. As Neville defiantly tells Voldemort, when all hope seems to be lost, that he and his friends will not die in vain. \"But you will,\" he says, \"because you're wrong.\" Perhaps the books are better and perhaps it isn't worth the 16-plus hours to get to this film. However, the final installment of Harry Potter does capture the importance of self-sacrifice and bravery in the face of reckless evil. For that, it is a magical experience.",

I was very literally in tears for the last 30 minutes or more of the movie, from The Pensieve scene, to the epilogue. Maybe it was because the movie was genuinely sad, maybe because it was the last movie in the series, or maybe both, this was one of the most somber movies I have ever seen. It was truly an emotional epic. The epilogue scene, although loathed by many, was terribly tragic. It wasn't meant to be sad, but seeing the Hogwarts Express leaving, with John Williams' theme motif in the background was truly saddening. Why does it all have to end? Why does my childhood have to die. Why can't these characters and this place that we have come to love have to leave us. But, I digress. All other aspects of the movie are amazing. From the acting, highlighted by Alan Rickman, to the score, that fits the movie ever so greatly, I loved it. But, we must always remember that \"Hogwarts will always be open to to welcome you home\". We must remember that the books and the movies shall always live on. As long as there are those of us that love this world, it shall never truly die. Goodbye Harry, you shall always be missed.",

            "content": "The final installment of the grand Harry Potter series is filled with drama, thrills, action, excitement, and just the right amount of finality. Director David Yates reigns in a wildly-popular franchise and creates a very solid and fitting finale. Though this installment is the shortest out of the series, it does not mean it is lacking anything. The character arcs are all fleshed out and finished nicely. And all the supporting elements, from the screenplay, to the sets, costumes, film editing, visual effects, and music, all cohesively come together nicely. However, since this is Part 2, you really need to see Part 1 in order to understand what is going on in this installment. And the material left in this section of the original novel really isn't enough to help the audience if they haven't seen or read any of the other movies. You really need to watch the first installment to at least get the gist of what is going on here. And though there was not a lot of plot left to flesh out, I still felt that Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves could have taken a few liberties and strengthened the script further. They had all the time in the world to make the film even more solid, from adding some more dialogue for some characters to reworking some of the story's exposition. Though it was miles better than Part 1, they could have strengthened the weaker parts, such as the final duel between Harry and Voldemort. It is such an important and iconic scene in the novel, and since this is the last film, it should be just as important, gripping, and iconic. But it really wasn't. It was quite anti-climactic. But despite the script problems, hands down, the most impressive aspect of this film is the battle at Hogwarts. The action is so impressive, thrilling, and mesmerizing. It is truly a visual feast. And Alexandre Desplat's score for this last half of the film is right up there with John Williams' work on the first three Harry Potter films. And Desplat's nod to Williams during the epilogue was the icing on the cake. Despite the epilogue's awkward feeling, Desplat rescues the scene by saluting Williams' work from the first film and finishing this film and the entire series with the beautiful swells of Williams' phenomenal music. Overall, this was a very solid installment and a pretty satisfying conclusion to an incredible series.",

            "content": "The visuals and battle scenes are done well, like you would expect from a Harry Potter film or a grand epic. The movie itself felt like an epic, where battles were going on left and right, body counts were more than expected. However, I wish they had spent more time with some of the more major characters that lost their lives for Harry. They kind of just moved on after mourning for about 2 seconds. But don't get me wrong I was tearing up on some of these scenes non the less.\r\n\r\nThe movie unravels some of the burning questions we've had for the series such as Harry's past or what's the deal with Snape.  It ties up everything well and throughout the film they pay homage to some of the older films.\r\n\r\nThe character are all the same Harry and the gang are just as likable as ever. The stand out actors in this film are Nevel and Voldemort. Nevel has changed a lot since the first movie and it shows. He gets some good screen time and he was a joy to watch. Voldemort was played very well and he was sinister. You could feel the danger this man posses. He is cold and evil. I wish the other villains were given some more screen time.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a lot darker than the other Potter films, but still manages to put that good old Harry Potter humor in. However this movie is very heavy on emotions mainly because we know the film and journey is coming to an end.\r\n\r\nOverall this film is great, one of the best films I've seen this year. The acting is spot on, jokes are handled well, and the visuals and battles are handle extremely well. I have no doubt that this film will get an Oscar nom for Best Picture. I give \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\" a 4.5/5, an amazing end to an amazing franchise.\r\n\r\n                                                                           \"Fetch Status\"",

            "content": "Harry Potter y las reliquias de la muerte - parte 2 en efecto es una reliquia, un tesoro y una joya no solo para la franquicia sino para la historia del cine.  Como bien dijo Daniel Radcliffe \"Las Reliquias Parte 1\" es el inicio de una monta\u00c3\u00b1a rusa, que sube, esta segunda parte sin duda es la espectacular bajada y es que es y ser\u00c3\u00a1 un s\u00c3\u00admbolo \u00c3 (C)pico de una generaci\u00c3\u00b3n.  Es excelente, \u00c3 (C)pica y magnifica, en todo lo que caben las palabras tanto por sus actuaciones, por su Fotograf\u00c3\u00ada, por sus efectos especiales y su banda sonora.  \n\nLa historia nos deja en la muerte de Dobby.  De ah\u00c3\u00ad en adelante como dije anteriormente es una monta\u00c3\u00b1a rusa plagada de emoci\u00c3\u00b3n.  Para disgusto de los fans fueron suprimidos o siquiera pensados varios momentos del libro que no se mostraron. Siendo as\u00c3\u00ad, las mejores adaptaciones quedaron en el inicio con \"La Piedra Filosofal\" y \"La C\u00c3\u00a1mara Secreta\" que estuvieron a cargo de Chris Colombus; Lo \u00c3\u00banico en donde fall\u00c3\u00b3 esta pel\u00c3\u00adcula y peculiarmente el director David Yates es haber suprimido las escenas de las batallas que se desencadenan en la sexta entrega \"Misterio del Pr\u00c3\u00adncipe\" despu\u00c3 (C)s de la muerte de Dumbledore argumentando que toda la acci\u00c3\u00b3n iba a estar en las dos ultimas partes, y bueno, la batalla final no fue tan grande como muchos esper\u00c3\u00a1bamos. Sin embargo la sensaci\u00c3\u00b3n de un buen final para diez a\u00c3\u00b1os inolvidables se cierran correctamente con este \u00c3 (C)pico film. \n\nEl peso de las actuaciones cayo sin lugar a dudas a Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort), Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) y claro, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) esta pel\u00c3\u00adcula llevo al extremo a muchos actores y actrices que participaron particularmente en este ultimo film a mostrar toda su capacidad y talento.  Eso fue lo vimos con algunos notorios casos como el de Rickman, es quiz\u00c3\u00a1s, la mejor actuaci\u00c3\u00b3n de toda su carrera - hasta el momento ojala - pero tambi\u00c3 (C)n existen casos de un fracaso total como lo presentado por Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley) que demostr\u00c3\u00b3 no ser apta para mostrar emoci\u00c3\u00b3n alguna - amor, tristeza, furia, etc - pero el resto del legendario cast fue impecable.  Despu\u00c3 (C)s de todo es la crema innata de la gran pantalla Brit\u00c3\u00a1nica, \u00c2\u00bfno? \n\nSus efectos de sonido y visuales como siempre en todas la franquicia fueron simplemente excelentes: deslumbrantes, bien mezclados, sublimes y perfectos.    Mostrar todo su potencional en la parte t\u00c3 (C)cnica en esta ultima entrega sin duda deja un registro una calidad impecable y un reconocimiento que negligentemente no se le reconoci\u00c3\u00b3 a ninguna de las pel\u00c3\u00adculas de la franquicia f\u00c3\u00adsicamente, m\u00c3\u00a1s adelante tocaremos ese tema. \n\nAlexandre Desplat despliega su talento en el score de esta segunda parte de \"Las Reliquias\".  Si alguien aun se quejaba por el distanciamiento que se vio obligado a tomar John Williams no tiene mucho que envidiarle al se\u00c3\u00b1or Desplat, la m\u00c3\u00basica de acompa\u00c3\u00b1amiento simplemente es acorde al mundo de Harry.  Sin mencionar lo hermosa y oportuna que logra ser.  No solo las piezas de Desplat suenan en la pel\u00c3\u00adcula, el compositor franc\u00c3 (C)s hace un tributo a todos los que estuvieron durante estos diez a\u00c3\u00b1os componiendo para la saga, tales como Williams, Patrick Doyle y Nicholas Hooper. \n\nHarry Potter merec\u00c3\u00ada un Oscar.  La academia hizo caso omiso a todo el dinero, calidad y productividad de los mejores actores del Reino Unido que tuvo no solo \"Las Reliquias\" sino toda la franquicia durante estos diez a\u00c3\u00b1os.  Pero era predecible el fracaso despu\u00c3 (C)s de las nominaciones dadas dejado a a un lado la esencia de el joven mago y posteriormente como es conocimiento de todos, la injusta victoria de otros films que no pod\u00c3\u00adan siquiera compararse.",

I do like Daniel Radcliffe but at times i can't help but cringe at how desperate his acting is. This varies too between the supporting cast. I guess that's what you get when you choose looks over talent, but he was definitely better younger strangely enough. Overall though this is enjoyable and the magic of Rowling's world can't help but engross me. It's sad it has to end, books and movies.",

Everything leading up to the battle was great, and the last like 3 minutes before the credits roll was also VERY well done and extremely emotional for fans.  But the battle itself was a MESS!\n\nEvery time the story was starting to move well, it transitions to something that was really cool in the book, but out of place and confusing at times because of quick editing and a lack of setup beforehand.  As a result, many of the primary villains, besides Voldemort, would appear when convenient and got lost in translation.\n\nAll the big and dramatic scenes had the opposite problem; Literally every scene of importance was announced with and overuse of slow-motion and a barrage of soundtrack that was more loud than poetic. It happens so often that by the time Harry and V lock spells for the fifth time, you are desensitized to it.  \n\nAlso, I understand that this is a dark chapter in the HP story-line, however that doesn't mean the entire film needs to be literally dark.  Low filters, lack of lighting and a lack of color really lose their artistic edge after the first hour. There is still a sun in the Wizarding World...as far as I know...\n\nThis is not a bad movie, its just not a great movie, especially compared to the other films in the series.  Its hard to tell whether the film makers truly wanted to appease the fans, or just make it look good to critics. It was more style than it was substance, hence the fans' many complaints.  As a slightly-above-average HP fan (Read all of the books at least twice...Yea...), I expected more than what I got.",

This coupled with heart-wrenching goodbyes to some of the most loved characters in a decade, played by some of the best British actors in the business, the film undoubtedly packs a major punch.\r\n    All in all, Hallows Part 2 is a fitting end to the highest grossing film franchise ever, and is by far the best in the series.",

It felt rushed and ti certainly did not contain all the elements that the book offered up as storyline. This scene should have been slowed down and should have included everything the book had. This was supposed to be Alan Rickman's big moment in the whole series and they flashed through it as if it was a minor subplot with minimal effect on the story. Frustrating. \nNow, that being said, it was a very enjoyable film and certainly a nice sendoff for the whole cast of characters that everyone grew to love over the years. The battle scenes (should have been longer but I digress) were incredible with amazing special effect and I loved the end battle with Harry and Voldemort. Excellent work.

The movie is finely made keeping the book in mind. The director David Yates has gained enough experience to make this last part absolutely stunning. The bells and whistles must have taken a toll on the budget for the way it looks beautiful. I'd like to bid adieu to the series we all have been following for over a decade. For the first time in the series, I was got more than I bargained for in satisfaction. I'd like to see this as a great finale despite its minor overzealous glitches.

Plus yes, I happen to like Hermione (Emma Watson) as a character, but was it still necessary to make her such a Mary Sue in these movies? Feels kind of ridiculous when the female sidekick is a thousand times more competent than the hero. But, as I said, this is good movie. It manages to overcome its weaknesses remarkably well, feeling intense and satisfying and delivering a rather good ending. It's not perfect by any means, but I can live with it.

I just can not belive that young trio from the Sorcerses Stone could grow up so effective and seamlessly, that's why J.K. Rowling is so good; she can make you nostlagic and proud of her characters and they did exactly the same thing in the movie. \n\nMusic was darker, more epic and adapted very well on the movie. My best scene was when Harry banish Snape from Hogwarts and prepare for attack.....such a great piece of cinematography, music, atmosfere..great job. \n\nActually the whole movie was very well directed and written, but because of giantic book they could't put it all in the movie. At the moments it seems that the movie is a mess because of that. I gave it 8/10 because of that and the fact the movie overall wasn't a perfect. We have dubb acting sometimes, plot holes to anyone without previous knowledge of the book and the script could be written much better. \n\nThis movie is great and I recommended it to any fans of Harry Potter, sci-fi fans, and all children in the world.",

I've watched the films from the very beginning, and although they've never lived up to the high standards of the books they have really begun to disappoint me since David Yates took over as director. This was no exception. Technically it was amazing, the special effects were astounding. The acting level was generally high too, and the final battle was exciting and fast paced. However, so much of hte emotion and depth was missing from the film. Harry's final goodbye with Ron and Hermione before he thinks he is going to die is under acted and not nearly tear jerking enough for three best friends. Ginny, once again, is a terrible character. She is wimpy and not the feisty character that I fell in love with. There is no chemistry with her and Daniel Radcliffe. At all. The deaths are done appallingly, You don't even see Fred's death, and you only know Lupin and Tonks are dead from seeing thier corpses for less then ten seconds. Which is horrible and ridiculous. Ron, Hermione and Harry's discussion at then end is also slightly jerky and awkward. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful, I've already mentioned some of it's positives, and it's the best film under David Yates' direction. But as a whole, by this stage in the series, the charm and affection seems to have been drained from the films, and it's a great shame...and annoyance!",

The visuals are top notch, and the action nerve racking. \n\nThe three main leads show how there acting skills have truly developed, and  how they were perfect casting choices from beginning to end. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape also delivers a great performance; that might even land him a Best Supporting Actor nomination this coming Oscar season. Ralph Fiennes does his best job yet as Voldemort. He's cruel, funny, and horrifying all at once.  Lower cast members come back for there final show, each making an impression. Such as Matthew Lewis, Helena Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith, and Julie Walters. Each deliver there scenes right on cue showing how good of a cast the Harry Potter franchise possesses. \n\nThe Harry Potter franchise is arguably the most successful franchises in history. It is the most successful box office wise;.the facts speak for themselves here, and in my opinion it is one of the greatest franchises of all time criticaly speaking . The movies will stay in our history, just like the books that inspired them, forever. \n\nLanding at number 14 on my \"Top 20 Favorites\" list, I give Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2, \n\n4 and Half Stars out of 5.",

            "content": "For over 10 years we have been enthralled by the lives of three young wizards as they have undertaken perilous journeys, battling unimaginable foes against incredible odds, all while being confronted by the challenges of simply growing up. \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2\" (2011) is the perfect Harry Potter movie, that soundly finishes off this epic series of films on a triumphant note.\r\n\r\nI have already gone on record saying how much I loved \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1\" (2010), and yet, believe it or not, Deathly Hallows Part 2 is even better. While Part 1 acts like a place holder, Part 2 takes everything we have learned and experienced with the last 7 movies and masterfully crafts the perfect finale to one of the most amazing tales in movie history. Returning director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves takes the best that the final book has to offer, and create a stark contrast between the two parts. While the first part was dark, brooding and desolate and a story of resistance fighters of circumstance living off the land, part 2 is nearly all action and is the climax of the entire series, with the fate of Harry and everyone and everything holding on by a mere thread.\r\n\r\nAs with all the other films, Deathly Hallows Part 2 contains a great degree of psychological depth, though it is very much at the forefront in this installment. Early on in the series, the white and black hats where easy to see, and proper action was always taken in regards to the latter. However, as the series progressed, black and white turned to shades of grey, and determining who to trust or who was on who's side became quite the challenge. Well with the final part of the puzzle coming to fruition in this film, a great moral comes with it. One that shows us that many of the seemingly easy judgments we made earlier on in the series were far off the mark, and that this wonderful world has many more facets than we might have thought.\r\n\r\nDaniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, originally unknowns when cast for \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (2001) a decade ago, have grown up before our eyes to become very competent actors. Daniel Radcliffe, as the titular Harry Potter, has been the standard bearer throughout all 8 films, and in this final installment, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance, he rises to the occasion like never before, flexing his well developed thespian muscles. His strengths have always laid in being able to convincingly portray the pain and anguish his character has felt throughout the series, a task that requires that special something to induce empathy, and once again, along with his constant companions Hermione Granger, played by the beautiful Emma Watson, and Ron Weasley, played by Rupert Grint, perfectly elucidate the vast material at play in this film.\r\n\r\nA well deserved Best Supporting Actor Academy Award Nomination should finally go to Alan Rickman who has masterfully starred as Severus Snape throughout all 8 films. His deadpan, humorless, droll portrayal of the conniving and condescending menace of a man has been a highlight of the franchise, and one can only hope that the Academy finally recognizes the brilliance he has brought to this series. Another stand out in the series has been the dictatorial and ruthlessly evil, Lord Voldemort, played frighteningly by Ralph Fiennes. His tone is this film is far from the omniscient, all powerful, murderous master of the dark arts we have grown to know throughout the series. He is desperate, agitated, neurotic, and distrustful of those even closest to him...easily paralleling Hitler's fall towards the end of the WWII, though I suspect that will be missed by the young fans out there. Maggie Smith, as Professor Minerva McGonagall, also deserves a special mention, as she steps up big time to make for the loss of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and finally getting to see her cut loose in battle is a very welcome sight. Matthew Lewis as the much loved Neville Longbottom, also deserves a mention as he finally completes his transition from dimwit to hero.\r\n\r\nAlong with the fantastic main cast, this movie also does a nice job of including many past characters from the \"Harry Potter\" universe, though due to Deathly Hallows Part 2 being the shortest film in the franchise, its a shame they didn't make it longer, and didn't give those beloved characters more than just a cameo. Same goes with many of the locations and peculiarities at play in the film. A longer run time would have given those characters a proper and worthy send off and revisiting those old locations would have been a nice tickle of nostalgia.\r\n\r\nOne of the consistant stand outs of this franchise has always been the magic, creatures, and far out imagination at play. The CGI and special effects has always been top notch, and this film lives up to that once again. However, as with all the other films in the series, this is once again a movie about friendship, and is grounded in its heart and soul, that just happens to have amazing special effects that join up for the ride. Many movies today should take note of this, as over the top special effects alone do not make a good film, but its the loveable characters and experiences they undergo that make us care. Also, I feel I should note that I don't believe this movie needs to be seen with the darkening affects of the 3D gimmick, as the past movies have been amazing in simply good old 2D, so don't fall for that Warner Bros. cash cow.\r\n\r\nI will be honest, I am by no means a \"Potterhead\", and have not even read any of the books, and therefore am sure to have missed many of the special easter eggs and nuances that only hardcore Rowling readers will catch. However, I have thoroughly enjoyed every one of the movies in this series, that have been compared to \"The Wizard of Oz\" of its time, and have very much loved these characters that I have grown up watching. This final movie is a very bit sweet moment, as it closes a part of my childhood, but has been very worth the ride. I highly doubt we will ever see a decade long series such as this one that has been produced with as much love and integrity, and has continued to dazzle us the entire way through.\r\n\r\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2\" is a fantastical film that perfectly wraps up one of the most important franchises in movie history. From the once again stunning special effects, to the beloved characters trapped in the maelstrom of world ending fate, this movie has something for everyone. The story finally comes full circle like any good myth should, and is the perfect franchise capper. If you have every escaped into this world, even but for a moment, you owe it to yourself, and the characters within it, to see this movie. A well deserved A+!",

The final battle between Harry and Voldemort felt anti-climactic mostly because the setting changed from the book. I wanted everyone to witness and hear about the sacrifices that Snape made like they did in the book and for them to understand how Harry ultimately defeated Voldemort. It also felt throughout a lot of the film that we just jumped from scene to scene, as in - then this happened, then we did this and then this etc.\r\n\r\nI loved the Hermione and Ron kiss, for such a big build up they did a great job and all the teachers being involved in the battle was great.\r\n\r\nI really look forward to watching The Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part 2 together in one sitting, it may make me see this film in a different light. Special mention should go to the casting staff for their efforts for all the films as I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these parts. \r\n\r\nAcross the whole series of films it really was a fantastic journey and a great addition to the incredible world and story that JK Rowling created in the books and one that I am sure I revisit many times in the future.",

            "content": "In this summer's \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2\", Daniel Radcliffe and Co. pleasantly come into their own, completing an iconic and mystifying ten year movie run.\r\n\tAs an avid reader of the books, who had his nit-picky issues with the previous seven films, I was admittedly cautious walking into the packed South Dennis cinema for a midnight showing of Harry Potter's self-promoted \"epic conclusion\". Fanboys and girls all around, some in full Hogwarts garb, eagerly shuffled into the theater, visibly excited for the event.\r\n\tAfter a slight issue in the projection room, which led to a full theater viewing of the \"Captain America\" trailer almost five times, the trailers began working and everyone in the room fell into an excited silence.\r\n\tMy thoughts contemplated over the next few minutes the fact that even if the movie wasn't enjoyable, at least I got to see the first teaser trailer for 2012's \"The Dark Knight Rises\".\r\n\tIn short, \"Hallows Part 2\" delivered in its promise of grandeur. Unlike the slow-paced \"Hallows Part 1\", nearly half the movie is an action scene, beautifully choreographed with special effects impressively crafted to create a mixed feeling of chaos, excitement, and magic.\r\n\tThe story continues where it left off, with the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) stealing the famed elder wand from the grave of Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Immediately it moves onto Harry (Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) continuing their search for Voldemort's horcruxes: dark magical items containing a piece of Voldemort's soul.\r\n\tAn impressively sequenced heist of Gringotts Bank, flows swiftly into the final battle at Hogwarts School, and eventually a final confrontation between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.\r\n\tThese actors have truly come into their own. After being tossed into a series that would encompass their teenage years, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint seem to have truly grown into their acting abilities, bringing the lovable characters from the books to expertly executed fruition. Their performances allow us to see their growth since The Sorcerer's Stone in 2001.\r\n\tThe acting in the film is superb. Call me crazy, but I'm ready to submit Alan Rickman as Severus Snape up for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. The story truly is able to find itself in its conclusion, touching on themes of friendship, loyalty, family, and of course, the power of good over evil.\r\n\tAnother important quality is its likeness to the book which is something I haven't seen done well since the third Harry Potter film, \"Prisoner of Azkaban\". \"Hallows Part 2\" takes all necessary precautions to make sure every enjoyable and necessary scene from the book is present. Inclusion of the Fiendfyre chase sequence and the conversation with the eerie Grey Lady add to the suspense resonating in each of the characters, which in turn makes its way into the audience.\r\n\tMost importantly, it left the audience wishing for a magical intervention that would make the experience never end. But as was said in \"Chamber of Secrets\", \"he'll never be gone, not as long as those who remain are loyal to him\". Something tells me, looking over the sea of Potter fans, that he'll be around for a while.",

I was so ecstatic that i made the effort to be there before the movies even opened. Watching it was like a dream come true. And honestly, i never stopped thinking about it for weeks until i read a book, the one i became obsessed with and has a movie coming up, and my friends are getting tired of listening to me. I salute Warner Bros. for the best production and adaptation of the book and, of course, J.K. Rowling for writing the spine-thrilling book and made it all possible. HARRY POTTER 7.2 ROCKS!!!!",

Lets start with the bad. The movie was waaaay to rushed. The final movies comes in just barely over 2 hours, easily making the final installment the shortest of all the movies. This short running time time leads to much to short duels and battles and it skims over almost every major death in the movie. The whole reason they split Deathly Hallows was so that they could fit everything from the books into the movie. So why then does it feel like Part 2 was rushed? I sincerely hope that this movie gets an extended cut Blu-Ray because it desperately needs one.\r\n\r\nNow onto the good stuff. This movie will bring you close to tears, which is exactly what should happen when watching the final movie in a truly epic saga. The whole time your sitting there on the edge of your seat wondering how it's all gonna end. Even if you read the books and know the ending, you're heart will still be racing. The special effects looked stunning as always and the performances were the best yet. I'd go on and on about the good stuff but I think it's be best if you just watched it yourself.\r\n\r\nAll in all I liked the movie, but it was kinda disappointing. It didn't have everything that this ending needed to make it perfect. Still highly recommended though.",

The main trio resume their search for the horcruxes, using the goblin they rescued, Griphook, to hatch a plan to enter Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringott's Wizard Bank and nab the horcrux they are sure is hidden away down there. Once managing that feat they figure there is just one horcrux left, and that it is hidden somewhere within Hogwarts. The only problem is that Snape is now headmaster, there are Death Eaters and Dementors all over the place! Nevertheless the gang hatch a plan to enter the school, with help from Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, and the hunt is on. Harry's presence in the school eventually becomes noticed by Snape however, which means that soon Voldemort and all of his cronies are knocking at the door. What ensues is an epic battle in and around the castle, and a fight to the finish between He Who Must Not Be Named and the Boy Who Lived. This was a really good film and a fantastic conclusion to one of the best franchises around! Unlike the first Deathly Hallows movie this one was pretty much non-stop action, and with all of the deaths of important main characters you could hear a pin drop in the theatre I watched it in. It was so exciting to see this film but also kind of sad as well, it is the end of something so amazing that's been ongoing in our lives for a long time. Can't wait for the DVD, then I can watch all of 'em in a row!",

The brilliant dynamic between Harry and his doppleganger Voldemort is dumbed down and flattened to appeal to the largest possible audience, the final battle at Hogwarts being a thin, lifeless and easy to swallow Wild West style showdown for the lowest common denominator of action fan. Looking back on the completed series as a whole, the Potter films have matured in visual aesthetic only. The magic is, and always was, in the books.

I know it cant be the same as the book, but to change the story in such big sections is hard to get used to.\r\n\r\nHowever, I thought some aspects were very good. The dark moody tone throughout the film really played well. \r\nThe dragon was particularly well done and the Piertotum Locomotor scene was just as I had imagined.\r\nThe end battle, regardless of changes made was epic.",

The three lead actors are overshadowed by the special effects and characters from the first six films appear sporadically throughout. I believe this is to create nostalgia now that the series is coming to a conclusion but it just makes the screen look muddled with too many people gathered together in an attempt to defeat a villain whom I had at this point stopped caring about.

Both in the sense of the wave of a wand and in the sense of the magic of movies themselves. I then think of 3-4. I get all the same feelings as before with one addition, the feeling of epicness. This was the golden age of potter for me. I was more into the books then ever, and the films were at their highest level. More importantly, my knowledge of cinema was expanding. I was now watching lord of the rings, Indiana jones, and star wars. I had stepped into a much larger world. Then came 5-6. These are to be honest among my least favorites. The flaws were more apparent know, as the films didn't have the same childhood connection as before. Still, I find myself thinking about some moments from them with a nostalgic sense from time to time. There was also a feeling with these two, especially with the last book being realesed, that it was coming to an end. Not just the franchise, but my childhood it self...\r\n\r\nI wasn't a big fan of part 1. I realize it was all set up for the big finale, but I still think it could have been better. This, on the other hand, is satisfying. Not a masterpiece, not ground breaking, but satisfying. I can't really give this a normal review. Like all the previous films, I don't see this film as performances and plot points, but as a collection of moments. The feeling of freedom when a dragon escapes. The feeling of sadness when we see snape's story come full circle. The feeling of awe as we see a character comes to terms with his own death. The feeling of pure joy when we see a charachter rise up and prove themselves to be more then just comic relief. Then, the final fight between Harry potter and lord Voldemort. The event that 10 years of films have been leading up to. The pay off to our childhoods. But, that's not the moment sticks out for me. The moment that sticks out for me Is the final scene. We see Harry, now grown up, sending his child off to hogwarts. We then see Harry again, one last time. We hear that music, that defines childhood and magic for me. And the credits roll. Could they have ended it any better? So, my childhood is finished. I leave it behind, at the movies. Where I hope to find it again next time I come. Is this movie flawed? Yes. But why would I feel the need to point these flaws out?",

When the trio discover a Horucrux inside Hogwarts they decide to go back, but Voldermort has control of the school with Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) as the new headmaster and Dementors gaurding the grounds and are looking for Harry. \nBut You Know Who now has the yet unbeatable Elder Wand, he aims to complete his final stage to ultimate power and launches an attack on Hogwarts School, where the trio return for one last stand against the dark forces that threaten to take over the Wizarding and Muggle worlds.\nPart 2 so builds on top of Part 1 in the most incredible ways possible. It has everything you could want from a Harry Potter film and its not only the end of the series but also a huge part of my childhood. The acting was so tremendous, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson really gave it their best this time and I know they'll miss it as much as we will, Alan Rickman show true emotion in his role as Snape and Ralph Fiennes is such a brilliant Voldermort overall the acting was tremendous, David Yates really shows how great a director he really can be in this final film, J.K. Rowling really is fabulous author, the plot magnificently written, the score is wonderful, the special effects are brilliant, the sets are so well made, the cinematographer is breathtaking, the editing is impressive, the ending is excellent and their really is a sense of honest emotion in this film. \nHarry Potter is a one-of-a-kind fantasy series: Its a story about life, bravery, friendship, conquering your fears, what you can do if you put your mind to it and growing up. I guess that's why the series is so popular and that it will always stay in hearts forever.\nPlease comment.",

Now most of the movies series were i dont like all the movies are the ones that excede 2 or 3 movies, which is when they begin to become underwritten or start to rehash ideas from the original films or the concepts just start to become old. I have to admire the Harry Potter movies to some extent just due to the fact that we now have 8 Harry Potter movies and i like every single one of them. I think what i like the most about this one over the others is that it's just thrilling to watch the whole way through, it starts off with some great action scenes, and the majority of the movie has some sort of action scene in it . It's also great that even though theres constant action and battle scenes, it has great dramatic elements to it, and i think its mostly due to the great acting by the entire cast, as this is the end they have to show thier emotions quite a bit in this film, and they also wraped up all the major characters stories very well, Severus Snapes in particualar. When i look back at my complaints about how I thought that the first part was very slow I'm almost thankful that it was now, because it meant that this one didn't need to waste time developing the story and was able to get right to the excitement that i felt the first one was missing. I feel like this is going to satisfy everone who likes Harry Potter, because from what I remember from the book (which is very little) it seems to stay faithful, and I dont think that they could have ended this beloved franchises any better than they did",

It's very operatic in scale and tone, and it whizzes by at breakneck speed, and it's a fitting end to an enjoyable franchise. It starts off from where Part 1 ended last year. Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) getting the Elder Wand from the grave of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Meanwhile, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) break into the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) at Gringott's Bank to get the a cup, which is one of the Horcruxes to be destroyed to defeat Voldemort. Then they have to get into Hogwarts, now run with an iron fist by Snape (Alan Rickman), to find a tiara which has to be destroyed too. Voldemort has assembled an army to bring down Hogwarts and kill Harry Potter, but our hero isn't defeated yet, although he learns that he was always destined to die, no matter what, as a bit of Voldemort has been in him from when he killed Harry's parents. It's a dark film but there is relief by the end, that there's no more threats to Harry. You've come to care and be entertained by these characters over the last 10 years, we've watched them go through childhood to adulthood. The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort is well worth waiting for. It is the shortest film of the series, you would have thought they would have gone all out with this one though.",

            "content": "Summary: Movie should have been longer and in 2D\r\n\r\nPlot: The film hinges on the final battle between death eaters and other wizards. Hogwarts is the center of all action. Death and destruction is no longer discussed in background. You literally see the beautiful castle, Hogsmeade and Gringotts being ripped apart and people die. Let me stop with that.\r\n\r\nSpecial Effects: The film has been shot in 3D and, as with its prequels, the final episode boots really good CGI. Apparations, flying broomsticks, dragons, giants, slithering snakes, magic - everything is thrown at the audience in the two hour running time of the movie. And its all so beautifully interwoven that you end up applauding their physics rather than cringe thinking about their improbability.\r\n\r\nCast: The main stars need no introduction. I guess this series was blessed, for they managed to complete production of eight movies with almost the same cast as they began. So in order to review the casting I need to go back in time - I guess it is unnecessary. I do not think we are going to get a more fitting description of Harry or Ron or Hermione. The only gripe is that we get to see less of some favorite characters (like Hagrid for example).\r\n\r\nPerformance: The lead characters have done good. Not just in this movie but the entire series. Kudos to the kids who dared to spend the most crucial years of their lives to entertain us (yeah they definitely got a handsome pay in return) and have been keen to learn from day one to get their acting skills honed. Of the others I would always rate Alan Rickman's portrayal of the complex character of Snape as a cut above the rest - it was like a character written in the book come alive. Evanna Lynch also cast her character (of Luna Lovegood) with charm. Helena Bonham Carter will forever be remembered as the sneering Bellatrix Lestrange.\r\n\r\nRead the full review at http://blog.nrajesh.com/review-deathly-hallows-2",

This particular scene was for me the highlight of the film, wonderfully portrayed and left me, as expected, in tears, almost to rival the written version. To fans of the films only it is a fantastic retelling and one could barely hope for more, except for perhaps a better ageing effect in the final scene, though still this did not distract from the overall feel of the film.

But then again it's not meant to, so not complaining.  Is it me or did it seem that Dumbledore was portrayed as a horrible bastard who sold poor Harry down the river?  A lamb to slaughter as Snape so aptly puts it.  Why did they not better explain the Elder Wand and how it passes from master to master, because it's imperative people understand that Harry does not kill Voldemort, ultimately, Voldemort kills himself and that doesn't come across.\r\n\r\nNow the good - Alan Rickman!!  Dude, you are my hero.  I was disgusted when he was killed off and dismissed in the book.  And while the death of Snape was pretty faithful to the book, Rickman's acting literally stole the story away from Harry in those moments.  He died a hero, as he should have.  The scenes in the penseive were awesome.  They were enough to let you understand how much he loved Lily but not so much that you resented James Potter.  Kudos.\r\n\r\nSoooooo glad they didn't attempt to explain the Deathly Hallows, too time consuming.  The horcruxes were far more important.  Ron and Hermione... Perfect.  Not too long or sappy.  Yay!\r\n\r\nNeville, you go!!  Loved the speech he gave after Harry 'died'. Just shows how far that character has come.  \r\n\r\nFinally, although some didn't like it, I loved that it ended with Harry and Voldemort standing alone, as it began.\r\n\r\nOh, and 'not my daughter you bitch!!!'. \r\n\r\nSuperb film, great acting, amazing effects.\r\n\r\nThank you Jo for sharing your world with us.",

            "content": "Few films come along with the weight of expectation and excitement than the Harry Potter films and none come higher or heavier than the final film of the series. Those who were never seduced by the source material or by the films themselves will never understand just how much Potter means to its fans and for ten years they (we)have been treated to seven films that each have delivered consistent quality. Even from the point of view of analysing the strength and faithfulness of the adaptations, we as fans have few things to really complain about. But Deathly Hallows Part 2 is different because it is the concluding part of a single large story split into 2 films, therefore it doesn't really have any excuse not to deliver. It isn't perfect but it comes damn close but none the less as finales go it's really hard to top.\r\n\r\nContrasted with all previous films, DH Part 2 feels the most confident in its design and execution. Such is the accuracy and assurance of how Yates has delivered the emotional punches that DH Part 2 easily feels the most confident. It benefits from being part 2 of a single film by diving head first into the action and it's fast and generally perfect pace keeps the film feeling constantly thrilling. Yet it does slow down appropriately and includes small but outstanding scenes with John Hurt's Ollivander, Warwick Davis' Griphook and Ciaran Hinds' Aberforth Dumbledore just to name a few. It's to Yates' credit that these small moments do stand out most because the action set pieces and glorious spectacle is spellbinding throughout; from the infiltration of Gringott's to the apocalypse on the Hogwart's Courtyard.   \r\n\r\nAs said above, Yates seems to have a firm idea on how to deliver scenes that should draw strong emotion and it's always been his greatest strength throughout each film. DH Part 2 is filled with arguably the best moments of the whole series; cold horror as Voldemort walks through a bloody slaughter, elation and suspense as the defenses of Hogwarts are raised. However Yates and his composer, Alexander Desplat should take a bow alone for the beautiful and heartbreaking moments as the truth of Snape is revealed and Harry's pivotal trip into the Forest. It's these grand and pivotal moments that fans have waited since 2007 to see on screen and Yates delivers them to perfection.\r\n\r\nHowever the films only real flaw is that it doesn't really slow down enough. There is a real sense that not much attention is given to the secondary characters, granted not always the most important, but characters who none the less have been there all along the last 10 years who you feel should get a good send off. Some you can relegate yes but to essentially ignore most of the Weasley's? Yates shows ill judgement here as well as reducing the pivotal Battle of Hogwart's to the background as well. His approach to focus primarily on Harry, Ron, Hermione and Voldemort is understandable and it does pay dividends but you do feel that more could have been delivered here because what's teased is breathtaking.",

Let's start with Harry Potter.\r\nHaving sensed Voldemort thinking of his Horcrux and Hogwarts through their connection, Harry tells Ron and Hermione that they have to go there and destroy it before Voldemort can get to it, adding that Voldemort seems to be getting more fragile and afraid with each Horcrux destroyed. They Apparate to Hogsmeade, but immediately trigger Caterwauling alarms set up by Death Eaters, who were waiting for Harry. The trio are almost captured, but Aberforth Dumbledore gets them safely into his home and berates them for coming to the village. \r\nHarry discovers that it was Aberforth who has been watching them through the mirror shard and the one who sent Dobby to rescue them after seeing the two-way mirror hung up on the wall. Aberforth provides them with food and advises them to give up on their mission, go into hiding and save themselves. Harry said that he trusts Albus Dumbledore's judgement that the task has to be seen through no matter what, but Aberforth insists that Albus had left them a suicide mission and it was hopeless. After Harry insists on finishing what he has started, Aberforth summons Neville Longbottom through a secret passage behind Ariana's portrait to bring them into Hogwarts!\r\nThis film was brilliant with lots of wand action! There will be a time when the action well stop but that is only to explain things to you. But all and all a great film!\r\n9/10\r\nhere's a little clip for it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLjGKDwNs1U",

His virtues are bravery, resourcefulness, focus and loyalty. It's in these last films that I appreciated this set of characteristics most. And these are the ones that win the day. As such. the films could have been more moving than they were. I suspect being set in magic land probably made that difficult but I also wonder whether Daniel Ratcliffe would have been the actor to convey this. I await his future films with interest. To be fair, the actor does mighty well in conveying the concentration, restless anxiety, anger and soul-searching his character's predicament demands and although the films are children's films, the cast treat them seriously and the exotic and enjoyable performances from a whole host of top actors serve as great counterpoint to Potter's 'real' struggle.\nLiked the film and recommend it.",

            "content": "Well, It's all over. The last chapter of a franchise of eight films that have enchanted people of every ages, in every part of the world, and have earned 7 billion dollars world wide and have become the highest-grossing franchise of all times, even beating out Star Wars and James Bond, who held the number one position before Harry Potter. I personaly have been more interested in the books rather than the films. But the facts is that's it's not going to be any other Harry Potter films, and now I feel the magic is gone, and there's no need to watch the movies or read the books again. It's a lot like graduating day, and I have to admit, I feld a tear during the last scene of this final chapter.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part two, follows where the last film ended, when Lord Voldemort took the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's grave. Our heroes Harry, Ron and Hermione is safe in a house at the beach where Ron's brother Bill and his wife Fleur Delacour lives. They just escaped from Malfoy's house with both Griphook and Olivander. Our heroes discuss with Griphook how to break into Bellatrix Lestrange's Gringotts vault to find one of Voldemort's horcruxes. After a nearly failed mission in the bank, our hero's manage to escape on a dragon. But soon after, another problem occurs, Harry gets into Voldemort's mind once more and watch his anger of how any got to know his biggest secret. Harry who already have destroyed five of seven gets finally to know where the final unknown horcrux is. And then our hero's have no other choice than to go back to Hogwards where Voldemort's right hand Severus Snape is in charge. And a fight between the good and evil, but first Harry have to get rid of his own demons first.\n\nMy opinion about this last chapter is that it's a good film with spectacular special effects, but some times it's can be to much show off, just to show what the animators can do developing new forms of special effects. Some of the scenes didn't need that much, it could easily gone for the more easy organic solutions. Most director these days don't see the magic of the characters, it's acting which is the real magic. It's not needed, this facade that has haunted this movie since the fifth part, when the death eaters starts to flying in black smoke and all the other starts to do the same. An example of where special effects have taken attention from the acting. But I also have positive feedback about the special effects, In this film the amazing battle sequence is beyond what I imagined.\n\nWhat did I think about the adaptation? Well I think it was good. The book contains many clues, that is spread through the whole series. The problem is you can't expect the audience to keep tracks of so many clues, and flashback wouldn't have worked either. So I'm surprised how they where able to paste in the clues, but it might feel like some of the solutions comes right of the thin air. One thing I specially liked about this film, was that the director knew the fact that this was the final film, and the fact that they used elements and places from the earlier films, and they have manage to take me back to it as it was before, every tiny little details, which brings a tear to my eyes.\n\nMy Conclusion of this very final film. it's that tells us all we need to know and there's nothing more to be told, there's no need for any sequels. It's over. Period. It's the whole conclusion of the entire series. combines old and new, goes back in time. The epic fight, both physical and psychological, and it's a movie that it's impossible to don't like. So I throw my hat in the air and give it a Thumbs up!",

I'm not a fan of Harry Potter books or films.  The stories are full of arbitrary deus ex magica solutions. I also believe the series promotes and justifies xenophobia, hatred and prejudice. Why is Voldemort bad? Because he is evil! Why is Harry Potter a hero? Because he was born to be one! It's probably silly of me to point out the tautological flaws in a fantasy flick, but the obvious heirarchical ranking of everything and everybody sure did irk me. Like the Slytherins getting herded into the dungeon, or how the sorting hat could have put him in Slytherin, but Harry really wanted Griffindor, because you know Griffindor is just  better. I was also distrubed by the greedy banker dwarves, and how similar they  looked to anti Jewish propaganda cartoons used by the Nazis and others looking for someone to hate. Elder's of Zion anyone?",

It seems the film makers tailor-made the last 4 movies only for the book-readers.
