    "summary": "Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) is a military lawyer defending two U.S. Marines charged with killing a fellow Marine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Although Kaffee is known for seeking plea bargains, a fellow lawyer, Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore), convinces him that the accused marines were most likely carrying out an order from a commanding officer. Kaffee takes a risk by calling Col. Nathan R. Jessep (Jack Nicholson) to the stand in an effort to uncover the conspiracy.",

            "content": "Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men is an interesting courtroom drama centering around three military lawyers (Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Pollak) defending two American Marines accused of murdering a fellow Marine at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, a site overseen by the domineering Colonel Jessup (Jack Nicholson).  It is a star-studded affair that remains compelling throughout, despite a music score that is periodically irritating and a story that is wildly predictable.  Will the defense team get past their initial distrust and dislike of each?  Will justice prevail?  Will Jessup pay for his actions?  The movie is ultimately memorable for the performance of Nicholson, who gives yet another iconic performance topped off with the infamous â€˜you can't handle the truth!!' scene.  The film is by no means ground-breaking, but there is some fun to be had along the way.",

The eye lighting was really nice and showed the emotion of the characters masterfully. Love this movie.",

            "content": "This is a solid courtroom drama film, set in the world of the US military. I can't say I'm in any way an expert in the area but I did find it surprising that Guantanemo Bay was mentioned numerous times, given this film dates from the early 1990s and I suppose I assumed that facility was set up in the early 2000s, prior to, or just following, 9/11. In any case, this film features a very solid cast and I'd say Jack Nicholsons performance was probably the best, in my view. It features the famous line of dialogue 'TRUTH?! YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!' which I'd certainly heard of but I hadn't realised it came from this film. Its powerful at times, although it does drag a little in some scenes with Tom Cruises cocky, smug character trying to shrug some things off etc. That irritated me but I see the points I assume were intended given the script. I believe this film is based on the play by Aaron Sorkin and its, for the most part, a solid story. I liked that it includes the female character, Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway, played by Demi Moore, who has to deal with men who aren't entirely keen on dealing with a female in a high rank like herself.\n\nI reckon its still quite a relevant film, given stories we hear nowadays about people serving in the army/navy etc. accused of things. Its a thought provoking watch and although it is a little slow in places, for a courtroom drama its by no means bad. Overall, yes I would recommend this film.",

This one, famous for Jack Nicholson's \"You can't handle the truth!\" line, (a performance that he was Oscar nominated for) had escaped me until now. Aaron Sorkin is a reliable pair of hands to trust with a script with, and his back and forth dialogue style is put to great effect in a story about Tom Cruise's lawyer assigned to defend two U.S Marines accused of murdering a fellow soldier. The performances are very solid (as you'd probably expect from a cast including Demi Moore, Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon amongst others) and for me A Few Good Men is a much more engrossing courtroom drama than Sorkin's recent The Trial Of The Chicago Seven (2020). The film is based on Sorkin's 1989 play, which probably helps proceedings; although it's no mean feat adjusting a theatre production to a cinematic screenplay (Denzel Washington's 2016 film adaptation of the play â€˜Fences' is a particularly dull recent example). You have no idea what the outcome of the trial is going to be, and even at the end of the film Sorkin has given you a shrewd idea of the mindset it takes to be a marine, the final sequence proving both the positive and negatives of such a job. It might not be the masterpiece that some claim but A Few Good Men is a thoroughly engaging courtroom drama with excellent performances from all involved, keeping you gripped from the outset.",

With his seventh feature, Reiner crafted a compelling courtroom drama with iconic lines that are still remembered today. Using captivating cinematography, Reiner draws viewers into the world of a lawyer that must defend scandalous marines. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is sensational, and uses razor-sharp dialogue to keep viewers engrossed in the legal case. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is at the top of its game. Tom Cruise delivers one of the best performances of his career as Lieutenant Kaffee. With intense expressions, he conveys the courage, determination and perseverance of a lawyer tasked with defending controversial marines. Jack Nicholson is equally excellent in the role of a corrupt Colonel that abuses his power. In one of his finest roles, Nicholson commands every scene he is in with memorable dialogue and an intimidating screen presence. Although \"A Few Good Men\" is undeniably compelling, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At over two hours, it suffers from an extended running-time. Moreover, it builds to a predictable conclusion that lacks originality. Nevertheless, fans of courtroom dramas will definitely enjoy \"A Few Good Men\" and so will movie-goers seeking taut entertainment. At a time when legal trials are rarely depicted in films, it's a stirring reminder of the dialogue-driven legal drama that simply doesn't get made anymore.",

Kudos to all involved.\n\nTom Cruise (Kaffee) is fantastic, definitely one of the (if not the) best performances I've seen from him. He has played similarly-ish before, but here his mix of comedy and drama is perfectly connected.\n\nDemi Moore is also terrific, supporting Cruise as Galloway supremely. Jack Nicholson (Jessup) also gives the top level, as he gets a now famous quote. Others, like Kevin Pollak (Weinberg) and Kevin Bacon (Ross), are also noteworthy. They nailed the casting.\n\nEverything else is just as class, from the pacing to the tension building to the cinematography. One thing though, and this isn't the film's fault whatsoever, but the late swerve didn't fool me as I practically knew it was coming due to the television show 'Suits'. Darn you Mike Ross!\n\nI had always heard the best about this film, so I'm delighted it lives up to the hype. Not seen this? Do so asap!",

            "content": "It is difficult to make a courtroom drama that feels like a feature film rather than a quality episode of television nowadays with the success of the long running Law and Order and NCIS. This is one of the films that falls prey to this trap as it feels like an extended pilot to a television show like JAG where the two main characters would have a will they won't they relationship and recurring judges would pop in and out between seasons. The film has a starry cast and is written by the vaunted Aaron Sorkin who would go on to write great films like The Social Network (2010) and Moneyball (2011) but it never quite becomes the great drama it could have been. I was disappointed by the film in many ways and I could sense the moments where the film made unfortunate choices that downgraded it from the sophisticated piece of entertainment it wanted to be to a pre-packaged piece of Oscar bait that told instead of showing.\n\nAt the Guantanamo Naval Base marines Harold Dawson, Wolfgang Bodison, and Louden Downey, James Marshall, torture and accidentally kill fellow marine William T. Santiago, Michael DeLorenzo, by stuffing a poisoned rag in his mouth. This was because they had been ordered to discipline him by their superior officer Nathan R. Jessup, Jack Nicholson, who had placed a \"Code Red\" on him. This was due to his failure to run as fast as fellow marines and the fact that he had ignored the chain of command and sent a letter to superiors informing them of his desire to be transferred and the fact that Dawson had engaged in misconduct. The men refuse to give up this information due to their devotion to being a Marine and this leaves lazy lawyer Daniel Kaffee, Tom Cruise, and his determined partner Joanne Galloway, Demi Moore, whom he reluctantly takes on struggling to build a defense for their clients.\n\nWhere the film falters is in it's climactic scene as while the mundane investigation and questioning of witnesses before this has been competent it is clear that this is meant to be what allows the film to rise above so many others. Sadly the film doesn't quite reach the level of intense drama it should capture as we have been forewarned of what tactics Kaffee will employ and the acting in the scene is so hammy that it brings shame on the genre as a whole. Everybody has seen the ten seconds in which Cruise yells \"I want the truth\" and Nicholson screeches back \"You can't handle the truth!\" but the context around this moments is botched. We feel as though Nicholson's admission of guilt is a foregone conclusion and the tactics that Cruise uses to draw a confession out of him are not that different from what he had been doing the entire time. The film wants us to believe that Cruise has grown as a person and as a lawyer but this scene does not give us enough to support this conclusion so unlike other great character studies of lawyers under pressure the film does not earn it's grand conclusion.\n\nThe film also looks like a television drama as cinematographer Robert Richardson covers every frame in a sheen of golden light that suggests a cheap production. Courthouses have been filmed many times so I understand that it is difficult to add any point of difference to them but in The Verdict (1982) you get a sense of the coldness and unforgiving nature of Boston inside the sepia tone room and this film provided us with the most generic image we could have been presented with. Rob Reiner's workmanlike direction betrays a lack of passion for the source material as he fails to do anything new and exciting as the most ambitious decision he makes is including a montage in which Cruise's manic voiceover is set to shots of Moore eating pizza and Cruise excitedly gesturing to his friends. The film could have at least tried to spice up the tired genre in which it works but it chooses to rely too heavily on tropes from the films that have come before it and does not put them to good enough use.",

            "content": "A riveting courtroom drama from early-career Aaron Sorkin, one that's absolutely stuffed with taut suspense, gripping dialog and A-list actors delivering lifetime performances. Not bad for a first-time screenwriter. It's an intelligent film that smoothly toes the line between spelling things out and relying on legalese to skim the details. The audience gets a thorough understanding of the issue, the limits of the law and the goal of both teams, but that information is slowly rationed and rarely over-explained.\n\nWe see vivid flaws in our heroes and earnest values in our villains. Each important player gets their chance to shine, and boy, do they all smack the ball out of the park. None moreso than Jack Nicholson, whose \"You can't handle the truth\" outburst has become synonymous with the picture. That speech still holds incredible power today, not just for the substance of the words (which remain pertinent, nearly thirty years later) but for the raw, unguarded emotion of Nicholson's delivery. It's easy to overlook the fact that he's scarcely on-screen for fifteen minutes, that climactic delivery resonates for so long. Tom Cruise and Demi Moore also bring their very best - I don't think Jack's moment burns quite so bright without Cruise there to egg him on - and a whole mess of supporting players are equally motivated, but that's just water under the bridge. It's all about getting to that speech, about earning that speech, and then basking in the afterglow of what it meant. \n\nDaring, unflinching, passionate moviemaking that keeps us guessing to the very last breath. It's still every bit as good as I remembered.",

            "content": "A brave look into holding all ranks of society accountable.\n\nRob Reiner's courtroom drama A Few Good Men (1992) sees Tom Cruise represent two Marines accused of murder. It is a riveting movie that delves into the purpose of why lawyers represent clients, how far they are willing to go, and the ethics of military protocol. It is rare for such a patriotic film as A Few Good Men to call out the flaws in the American military, but it does so respectfully in order to make audiences understand that just because someone is ordered to commit a crime while in uniform that they are not absolved of their actions. Life has consequences and A Few Good Men demonstrates that sentiment beautifully.\n\nRob Reiner's direction is a masterclass of engaging viewers with powerful performances, witty script writing, and thoughtful presentation of facts so that you are never bored with the technical points about Marine code and conduct. Reiner was on a hot streak after Stand by Me and Misery, so following two beloved classics with another is especially impressive. A Few Good Men is sleek and trimmed down to just the necessary dialogue and the most interesting angles. Reiner understands how to depict an intriguing mystery within a fascinating courtroom drama with his reflective style. He always lets you see the characters speaking with nice medium shots only zooming in for emphasis on occasion. I will always appreciate how Reiner lets his shots breathe with the audience without endless jump cuts.\n\nAaron Sorkin's screenplay, adapted from his play, is riveting. Sorkin's normally excessively wordy scripts is actually cut down neatly here. His dialogue features strict military code delivered in easily understandable phrasing, clever romantic flirtations, and witty jokes that ease up the serious weight of A Few Good Men's subject matter. Sorkin delivered an all timer with this script.\n\nI really like the moody and rising score from Marc Shaiman. It fits the heavy tone as well as the cooler comedic moments.\n\nI think Tom Cruise is the real draw here. His relaxed defense attorney is so likable and dismissive simultaneously that you are endeared to this odd character immediately. He is so chill that Cruise eases you into the world of military court martial trials. His chemistry with Demi Moore is palpable as they both feel respectful of each other. Moore is great as an ambitious and well meaning attorney within the Navy. She comes across as genuine and eager to impress. I think she fits the strong female role model type shown herein as an intelligent woman and a no frills Lieutenant Commander.\n\nJack Nicholson is brilliant as the complex and resolute Colonel. His breakdown on the stand in A Few Good Men's finale is an iconic display of fine character acting and thrilling climax to the movie. His earlier moments are full of neat character reveals.\n\nLastly, I like many of A Few Good Men's supporting roles. Kevin Pollak is amazing as Cruise's assistant. His ability to rattle off facts as well as correct Cruise in the moment make him a great ally and a wonderful foil. I particularly like when he is honest about his feelings for their clients. It's a nice honest moment for these characters.\n\nFurthermore, Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, J.T. Walsh, Wolfgang Bodison, James Marshall, Christopher Guest, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Noah Wyle all have fun supporting roles in A Few Good Men that I enjoyed.\n\nIn all, Rob Reiner is a phenomenal director, which he proves again with A Few Good Men.",

A Few Good Men has fast paced script, enough content to feed the audience for more than 2 hours and contains a power packed performance with amazing dialogues and compelling arguments in it. Rob Reiner is not in its A game since its execution seems a bit petty, childish and amateur as its loosely packed in between big moments. Tom Cruise is amazing in it with a good supporting cast like Jake Nicholson and Demi Moore. A Few Good Men hits fast and hard with an exhilarating first act but dips down a bit in the second one only to escalate into delivering stunning climax.",

When we see we don't just accept anyone, but the best to answer to everything we do is just according to the law & what we see fit best represents our countries values. When we see we need a long shot in gathering evidence to see what we believe to be fighting the right side to be true we find following the process would involve see to it that there would be people at cost for their actions. When what we didn't see before it is revealed to us that we are on the fences of obtaining evidence when we can't see or gather. When we see a few good men when we speak to them that they were only following orders to know this was intentional. When we see following the chain of command is hard when we only see winning & titles that makes connecting & communicating difficult when we only like to see it our way. When we see beliefs are what comes from within, when it eats up on us that we can't take a stand for anything else we wish to see rather than our beliefs that we see that we must fight for or all everything we see would be a lie. When we see that we do runs in the family when we have an eye in somethings we see worth fighting for when ethics are involved. When not all wish to see us when we are a hurdle in moving forward & progress against the enemy. What we don't see is what others see and follow to know that they follow a process within a process when they see a code they must follow. When we see that things are done differently here, to see that we follow formalities to let the law judge if different ways constitute for justice. When we see processes need to be respected too when we have two sides seeing eye to eye in what we stand for and what others dont stand for to see which side is right. When we see we must be seen as winners, confident & look good in front of a jury when we are working on nothing until we see something unearth we didn't see before. When we see that some opportunities comes rare when evidence is stacked beside you and your able to go through the layered process to see we have a long shot in obtaining the truth or risk everything. When what we don't see is the judge thst doesn't allow, the opposing lawyer that is blinded by winning & losing, the lack of evidence you can obtain in moments where evidence and access is restricted, a honest suspect, and the reprocussions of our actions if none of these dont align for us to know justice reaching high levels of power is a long shot & hail mary.\n\nWhen we see thst we can't just unsee somethings to handle it accordingly by the law. When what others did not wish to see they get rid of, what they didn't see they were up for the job and could cost other lives in the process. When we don't see somethings but see other things we go the wrong direction in what we see. When we see we handled such matters a different way when we can't hold somethings responsible for lives, promotions and respectability of this army at risk. When we see the front lines of action we see it all, while civilization sits comfortably in their seats while we keep them safe for them not to see what we see. When we see ourselves close to that fence seeing the enemy or future enemies thst is all we have to do when the pressures of failure is not acceptable when we need to protect that wall of safety our country so heavily wants us to safe guard we put no lives in jeopardy over 1 issue that stands in our way. What we see and everyone sees is we need to it for GOD & country. When what we wished to see avoid we see we received something worse when we try to do things the way we see it and not others we try to sneak past justice of our country vs our own instant justice.

He's defending two marines who're accused of killing a fellow marine because said marine ratted one of them out for breaking one of the rules. Funnily enough, we're shown the murder right away before we're even introduced to Cruise's character, Nicholson's character (the commander of the marines in Guantanamo, where the murder takes place), or Moore's character (another lawyer working with Cruise). Technically, we know who did it from the start, but the story is far more complex than that and there are tons of twists and turns that shake things out as the film continues. \n\nWhat makes all the courtroom cliches work so fluently together without seeming rehashed is a combination of superb acting, strong direction, and a very smart script from the incomparable Aaron Sorkin. There's humor, heart, and excellent character development, and the film has a snappy but not rushed pacing. \n\nCruise's excellent performance here is why I can't really agree with the second criticism I've heard. He's the life and soul of this movie, playing a witty, sarcastic, loud-mouthed jerk who does what he wants and shows little respect to his commanding officers. My kind of hero, then. Of course, he faces a lot of bumps in the road (Nicholson is the big one in every sense) and Moore's character (and that Kevin Pollak, his partner) are there to guide him past his ego and into the land of success. But it's definitely Cruise's movie, and he elevates the sharp script past its formulaic roots and into some incredibly entertaining melodrama. \n\nRoger Ebert criticized the film for being too didactic, for leaving too little to the audience's interpretation. I'd often agree with a criticism like this, but with \"A Few Good Men\" the over-explanatory nature of the script actually works in its favor, letting us think we know how things are going to pan out before they pan out so that we're more invested in seeing if they actually do pan out. Like everyone, I knew \"You Can't Handle the Truth!\" was bound to come out of Nicholson's mouth at some point during the final confrontation, but part of the surprise (no, all of the surprise) in these courtroom films is not in what happens, but how it happens, and listening to Cruise deliver Sorkin's beautifully specific monologue while interrogating Nicholson had me feeling legitimately scared and nervous - the butterflies, the goosebumps, everything - to see how the hell he could get himself out of the mess, and Nicholson into it. The best films are not always the ones that build up to a surprise, but that surprise with the build up. This is one of those movies.",

He made movies that people know and love like Misery, A Few Good Men, The Princess Bride, Stand By Me, and many others. Now he just make movies that people either don't care, or know that it's going to suck. I know it's a clichÃ© thing to say but it's true and it doesn't seem possible that he would never make a good movie in the future. In the past, he really made an amazing movie like A Few Good Men with support from writer Aaron Sorkin. I didn't notice him until I saw films like this and The Social Network and realized that he's a talented writer. It has engaging dialogue and smart writing that can get the viewers interested. I didn't think it was really predictable, except for one scene though, but that's because I seen movies that done this before, which would make a difference. So I'll just ignore that only small flaw as it's just very minor. Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, and Kevin Pollak are amazing in it, but also have a fantastic supporting actor that is Jack Nicholson who is easily one of the best parts of the movie. The characters are memorable, and the courthouse scenes are very tense and smartly well done. There are some scenes that I thought were going in this kind of route, but actually doesn't go there, which I appreciate. I like that from each side, you can see and understand what they are going through, and why they are doing this.

Yet what is an issue is the way that the story unfolds. It is always easy to tell what is going to come next and there really are not all that many surprises in the film. Everything unfolds as it should and there is nothing that Rob Reiner does to divert away from that. So as a courtroom drama, A Few Good Men is a very conventional film.\nBut aside from the predictable way that the story progresses, A Few Good Men is a great film. Although the nature of the script is rather predictable, it is full of intense and realistic language which empowers the dramatic aspects of the story. But more importantly, Rob Reiner gives it terrific handling. The intense nature of the premise in A Few Good Men is assisted by Rob Reiner's direction because he is able to inject a tense atmosphere into the film and handle the material well enough for it to be sophisticated. The thing about A Few Good Men is that the story is a mix of looking for answers and interrogating for them which means that it is about a mix of determining the answers to events and determining who really knows about them. It is interesting to watch because it sucks viewers in and has them really wanting to see what is going to happen and understand precisely why it happened. Although the premise is not too complicated, the characters are and the film really establishes a sense that viewers want to find out who they are and it gets them deeply involved with the story. A Few Good Men is a very old-fashioned film, but it maintains a lot of interesting concepts and subject matter to keep viewers watching and enough thrills to grab their attention.\nThe script in A Few Good Men is tense and full of interesting characters, but when you get right down to it the importance of the film rests on what the actors are able to do with their parts, and as it turns out the cast of A Few Good Men end up giving maximum power in their efforts.\nTom Cruise is excellent in A Few Good Men. In A Few Good Men, the importance all rests on the way that he delivers his words, and it is one of the times that he gives a performance where is egotistical nature is central to the character instead of being annoying. It reflects a certain careless spirit in him which later has to change so that he can develop into a more powerful figure as the story develops. He goes through a lot of character development in the role of Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee and progresses as the story develops by being more and more emotionally intense. Tom Cruise goes through a lot of progression in A Few Good Men which makes him a powerful leading cast member, and his chemistry with the surrounding cast members is great because he establishes real relationships with the many people around him and strengthens the nature of the story in the process. Tom Cruise is a powerful lead in A Few Good Mean, and he delivers his lines with such power.\nJack Nicholson was not present in A Few Good Men as much as I had hoped, but when he was on screen he was magnificent. You can see true antagonistic darkness in his soul through the simple stare in his eyes and the way that he projects further strength through the intensity of his line delivery. He constantly maintains a suspicious attitude which leaves viewers asking questions about the true nature of him and his motives, and within him is a certain sense of darkness. It is an evil which has overthrown him as he has become so mercilessly obsessed in his work that he has forgotten to be human, and it only takes a matter of a few scenes. Jack Nicholson is fierce and powerful in his performance, relying simply on the grit of his line delivery to carry him the whole way. It is no problem for him, and the genuine strength that he brings to the role is just terrific. Jack Nicholson empowers A Few Good Men with his intense performance and feisty delivery of the iconic line \"You Can't Handle the Truth!\". His Academy Award nomination was a well deserved one, and his performance is really unforgettable in A Few Good Men.\nDemi Moore turns in a powerful supporting performance. Although her character is not all that key to the story in the end and seems to be there simply for the sake of the archetype, Demi Moore delivers a very powerful dramatic performance which proves to be one of the best she has ever given. The material in A Few Good Men is very mature and sophisticated which gives her a chance to prove that as an actress, she is too. Demi Moore delivers her lines with a powerful understanding of everything that she is saying and she works to establish a powerful chemistry. Demi Moore relies solely on her ability to conjure up an intense line delivery in A Few Good Men, and so it remains one of the most memorable performances of her career.\nKevin Bacon gives a tense supporting effort, and James Marshall creates a very sympathetic character.\n\nSo although A Few Good Men is a predictable film, it is anchored by powerful dramatic performances and a tense mood established by Rob Reiner's firm direction.",

A callow, legacy, navy lawyer has to defend two Marines accused of hazing a private so extremely that they kill him.  Along the way, we tackle issues of whether honor means following a code of ethics or critically thinking for oneself.  Will the good guys win?  What does it mean to be a good guy?\n\nThese are important, heady questions drummed up by Sorkin, but I think he spent more time writing slick lawyer-speak instead of developing a key part of the story:  who is Santiago and why should we care about him, the circumstances in which he was killed, and the fate of his killers?  Why did he even join the Marines to begin with?  Where was he trying to get transferred to?  Why did he break the chain of command?  Why would he offer secrets for personal favors?  Why was he, in short, such a bad Marine?  Even if he had health conditions, he should've at least been able to keep his barracks orderly and be punctual.  His death seemed so clearly an accident that I wondered why all this hullabaloo.  I kept thinking there had to be more to Santiago, not just his death.",

            "content": "Rarely can a court room drama elicit the same amount of tension and audacious tenacity as a regular drama, however, Rob Reiner's, A Few Good Men, effortlessly pulls off effective tension and an amazing story thanks to the incredible cast, direction and screenplay. Having the film center on a court case involving the murder of a young marine immediately pulls the audience into the morality of each individual character, for this case means something different to everyone involved. Some are apathetic towards Santiago's death, such as Col. Jessup and Lt. Kendrick, while some of the ,\"few good men\", like the attorney Kaffe, truly believe in true justice and that compromises shouldn't be made to ensure the lives of humanity. Being thematically rich is an aspect of the film that screenplay writer, Aaron Sorkin, nails out of the ball park. Reiner is well known for his intimate style, focusing his framework exclusively on one or two characters, a trait which the legendary director carries over to this film. The utter power and emotion from A Few Good Men is largely due to Reiner's smart, thoughtful blocking, lighting, and framing of his shots, overall, a great job from director Rob Reiner. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is in fact the absolutely incredible script from legendary screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. A large part of what makes a film compelling is a good script with likable characters and memorable dialogue, not only is this films script good, but it is damn good. There are dozens upon dozens of memorable lines, soliloquys and monologues delivered from Sorkin's dialogue, Sorkin, as always, did an exceptional job in the screenwriting department. A lesser category in this film happens to be the score which is in no ways bad, but fails to keep up with the films incredible pedigree. Finally, the acting in the film is nothing short of astonishing, everyone is at the top of their game and truly commit to their performances. Cruise is believable as a lawyer, yet still carries the man's famous on screen charisma, combined with incredible lines; cruise is unstoppable in his role. Undoubtedly, the best part of the film is the incredible Jack Nicholson, whom even with a small amount of screen time, leaves an ominous presence throughout the film that never fades. Nicholson is a true bastard as Col. Jessup in film, however, is not considered evil, just a man with a different sense of morality. The only bad parts of this film is the somewhat convoluted plot and relatively slow pacing. Rob Reiner's, A Few Good Men, effortlessly pulls off effective tension and an amazing story thanks to the incredible cast, direction and screenplay, truly a film for the ages.",

This adaptation of Aaron Sorkin's play of the same name follows a careless US Navy lawyer, his friend and another attorney, and a Internal Affairs lawyer preparing to defending their two clients, who are US Marines on trial for the murder of another fellow Marine.  The courtroom drama digs deep into the process of a trial involving naval officials by looking at the case and evidence, which include witness reports and what was left from the murder.  The film also looks at how the case is affecting the lawyers and anyone involved with the investigation and trial.  The film adds investigation into the clients by looking at any prior events that could've been a motive for murder, or look at anything that was supposed to occur on a specific day and time.  Aaron Sorkin's script focuses on the subject and plot at hand, as well as adding a great blend of smart and silly dialogue, as well as comedy and drama, which helps give characters the much needed characterization.  Rob Reiner also brings the film to life with the right setting, timing, and weather.  The cast also do a great job at bringing this classic to life, including Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, and Kevin Bacon, who also display top notch chemistry, but the most powerful performance comes from Jack Nicholson, who shines as Colonel Jessup, who also gave us the classic quote, \"You can't handle the truth!\"  Marc Shiaman gives the appropriate music for each scene, setting the proper mood for each scene, and the overran tone for the entire film.

            "content": "In den Zeiten vor Navy CIS und JAG, war es Rob Reiners Courtroom Drama A Few Good Men, dass erstmals Einblicke in die Welt der MilitÃ¤rgerichte der US Navy bot.\n\nDer Film basiert auf einem TheaterstÃ¼ck von Aaron Sorkin, dass dieser selbst fÃ¼r die Leinwand adaptiert hat. Ich erwÃ¤hne das an dieser Stelle, weil man es sonst vielleicht gar nicht bemerkt. Im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Theaterverfilmungen ist nur ein Bruchteil von TheatralitÃ¤t zu erkennen, und der Film besinnt sich grÃ¶ÃŸtenteils auf seine eigenen StÃ¤rken.\nNur in manchen Momenten sticht die theatrale Herkunft durch, und dann wÃ¼nscht man sich dass das Ã¶fter geschehe. Wenn z.B. im GesprÃ¤ch zwischen Tom Cruises Lt. Kaffee und Demi Moores Lt. Cmd. Galloway Detailinformationen zum Leben und Ehrenkodex der US Marines erklÃ¤rt werden - ganz ohne Zwischentitel.\n\nDiese Eleganz setzt sich im weiteren Verlauf des Films fort, nur sporadisch durch Momente von Hollywoodkitsch unterbrochen (so z.B. wenn Cruise einen auf betrunken macht oder die absurde Menge an klischeehaften establishing shots, die einer 90er Jahre Fernsehserie entspringen kÃ¶nnten).\n\nAbgesehen davon zeigt Reiner eine verblÃ¼ffende AffinitÃ¤t zu groÃŸen Bildern und zu Farbkontrasten. Die Opening Credit Sequenz ist ein beeindruckendes Beispiel dafÃ¼r. Soldaten in blankpolierten Stiefeln und farbigen Paradeuniformen vollziehen einen Exerzierdrill. Weiters, stechen immer wieder die schneeweiÃŸen Uniformen der Navy-AnwÃ¤lte aus der Menge heraus.\n\nAnwÃ¤lte sind eines der am meisten glorifizierten Berufsbilder im modernen Amerika. UnzÃ¤hlige Fernsehserien beschÃ¤ftigen sich mit ihrem TagesgeschÃ¤ft, und mÃ¼ssen natÃ¼rlich tricksen, um Recherchieren und BÃ¼rokratie interessant erscheinen zu lassen. A Few Good Men ist da keine Ausnahme und verlÃ¤sst sich dabei auf kurze Ausschnitte der investigativen Arbeit der drei Verteidiger (Cruise, Moore, Pollak). Viel mehr Wert wird auf die Beziehungen zwischen den drei gelegt, und den kleinen Spielchen, die die Verteidiger mit dem AnklÃ¤ger (Kevin Bacon) spielen.\n\nDer finale Showdown zwischen Jack Nicholson und Tom Cruise entbehrt wieder jedem realistischen Gerichtsverfahren, aber bringt groÃŸartige schauspielerische Leistungen zu Tage und bietet ein genugtuendes Ende zu einer recht rasanten Fahrt.\n\nHandwerklich ist der Film stark, die Schauspieler geben ihr bestes, und vor allem Jack Nicholson brilliert in seiner Rolle als mÃ¼rrischer und sturer Colonel.\nA Few Good Men ist einen Abstecher ins Mainstreamkino der 90er Jahre wert.",

The sparks and barbs truly fly once they get into the courtroom together and I loved the physical acting by Cruise in this. Kaffe's unnerved facial expressions when he realizes questioning Jessep will not be easy in the least. His decision to continue questioning him and the noticeably shaky hand as he downs a glass of water after this decision. Brilliant. \nThis is a movie that really digs deep in the discussion of duty, honor, and following orders. Somehow I saw the ending coming as they were listing the rulings. The \"only following orders\" excuse can only get people so far, as evidenced by events such as the Nuremburg Trials.

Daniel Alistair Kaffee\" (Tom Cruise), a lawyer who always plea-bargined his way to a win without entering a courtroom, is assigned to defend them. \r\n\r\n\"Lt. Kaffe's\" first problem is to handle \"Lt. Cmdr. JoAnne 'Jo' Galloway\" (Demi Moore), who wants to be on the case so bad she gets the permission of \"Pvt. Downey's\" \"Aunt Ginny\" (Maud Winchester) to take over his part of his case. \"Lt. Kaffe\" declares himself lead council, with \"Lt. Cmdr. Galloway\" and \"Lt. Sam Weinberg\" (Kevin Pollak) as co-assistant council. His second, to keep his clients out of military prison on the grounds that they were under orders to haze \"Pt. First Class William T. 'Willie' Santiago\" (Michael DeLorenzo). \r\n\r\nJack Nicholson, who steals the courtroom scenes near the end of the movie, plays the accused superior commander. It is obvious to \"Kaffe\" that he is hiding more than he's telling, and he slowly learns that is exactly what \"Col. Jessep\" (Nicholson) is doing. \r\n\r\nIn this movie, all the crime scene clues which proves the defendants innocence are presented to the audience and are revealed through the eyes of \"Kaffe\" when he discovers them himself later on. You will raise an eyebrow when you realize that you saw a clue that might just help the defense's case. \r\n\r\nThe story drags a bit until the case goes to court. It then gets interesting as it is revealed that the defense has case is actually stronger than it appears to be earlier on. The performances of the main characters also become much stronger in court. \r\n\r\nPrior to the scenes in the courtroom, the performances aren't extremely good, but are still quite strong. This is most evident with Cruise, Moore and Nicholson. Other performances are equally as strong, but they are weakened by lack of character development and amount of screen time. \r\n\r\nNone of the scenes really stand out in this movie, except for the famous in court confrontation between \"Keefe\" and \"Jessup.\" However, that scene stands out only due to the performances of the principle actors and nothing else. The wardrobe, especially the military clothing, looks quite convincing as well. \r\n\r\n\"A Few Good Men\" is carried by the performances of the cast and a pretty good screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the play the movie is based on. In my opinion, this film could be a good rental.",

A Few Good Men showcases some terrific acting in a good enough story but it won't be winning any awards for it's screenplay and it didn't. I'm not saying the screenplay is bad but when you get right down to it, it's very basic. But, like most things, it's all in the execution and this movie was done expertly. For a 2 hour and 10 minute courtroom drama, it's surprisingly interesting and engaging, for the first hour it's all build up and then it unravels into a very interesting to watch court trial. The acting is what saves it, like I said it was terrific. When Tom Cruise appears, at least at first, you just see Tom Cruise being his Tom Cruisey self, soon enough though you see a cocky man turn into a determined yuppie lawyer vigilant to find the truth. Jack Nicholson was of course excellent, nabbing an Oscar nod, probably because of how he entered the courtroom and his epic memorable speech. Demi Moore was fine, she played her part well but it wasn't anything noteworthy to mention, Catherine Keener or Laura Linney spring to mind. Being a Rob Reiner directed film there are some comedic lines thrown in here and there and they are actually quite funny and don't feel forced at all. Can't believe after this damn good drama, he made North... There are just no words. Good acting propels the proceedings amazingly and is an iconic film because of it.",

            "content": "Yes indeed, y'all, we're talking about \"A Few Good Men\"... and Demi Moore. Shoot, as terrible as her bob cut in \"Ghost\" was, she may as well have been a man, which isn't to say that her haircut is that much better in this film and, well, quite a few other films. Shoot, no wonder Bruce Willis is bald now, his time with Demi Moore must have made him lose his faith in hair, yet that didn't stop Ashton Kutcher from falling for the botoxed \"beauty\", or at least until the affair, and that's the truth Demi, whether you can handle it or not. Man, real quick, that really is a great line from this film, but hey, I would expect nothing less from an Aaron Sorkin-written line delivered by Jack Nicholson, who could read \"The Scarlet Letter\" and make it exciting, or at least more exciting than the version featuring Demi Moore, which is good, because we're talking about a courtroom drama here, and in a case like that, you're going to bring in all of your guns if you're gonna liven things up. No, I'm kidding, this film is mighty entertaining, though that might simply be because it features Jack Bower from \"24\", Val McKee from \"Tremors\", G.I. Jane from, well, \"G.I. Jane\", Ethan Hunt from the \"Mission: Impossible\" film series and, of course, Jack Nicholson, who's so cool that you'd be splitting hairs if you were to pick out a particularly exciting character of his, so maybe that's why this film is so good. Well, that, and because the film is just plain pretty darn well-crafted. Still, while there are more than \"a few good\" spots all but throughout this film to very much get it by, the final product is hardly not guilty of making its share of shortcomings.\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with a film of this type, where consequence and momentum is high yet all behind dialogue rather than action, pacing needs to seriously be taken into consideration, and while director Rob Reiner manages to pump enough juice into the atmosphere to produce entertainment value that compensates for potential slow spells, actual pacing is all but absent, leaving the film to tread along, slave to its runtime, and oh, what a problematic slave owner it is. Clocking in at 138 minutes, this film isn't exactly \"JFK\", yet it's certainly longer than it should be as a dramatic dialogue thriller, which would be more forgivable were it not for the film's all too rarely finding time for a break. Certainly, I'm not asking that this film has so much slow-down that it gets to be uneven and bland, and plus, there's certainly not so much intensity to the film's momentum that the excessiveness of exposition and plot progression gets to be exhausting, yet too much happens before you can find a full grip on dramatic resonance, which isn't to say that there's not dramatic resonance at all, as dramatic exposition can be found intertwined with the plot momentum. Still, even though it is, in fact, present, flesh-out exposition isn't given enough primary focus for you to feel its full effects, thus bite is diluted and the exhaustingness of the excessive happenings, backed by only so much full expository establishment, is called more to attention. While the film is all talk, there's too much action to the dialogue than flesh-out, and full investment suffers, and with it, actual plot dynamicity. It doesn't take too long before things get to be quite repetitious, with only so much dramatic slow-down and plenty of fat around the edges of action, or whatever you call dialogue that moves plot foward perhaps more than flesh-out, thus the final product comes out overlong and dramatically limited, and by extension, with only so much to remember. Of course, what is worth remembering is in most of the right place, which leaves the film to stand as both memorable and rewarding, for although there is perhaps too much going on for there to be only so much build-up, the film keeps you going through all of its moderate dramatic shortcomings, or at least Aaron Sorkin does.\r\n\r\nAdapting his own play, Aaron Sorkin is certainly well aware of this material, and of how he can bring it to life, or at least liven it up, delivering dialogue that isn't exactly thoroughly snappy, yet consistently clever and lively, with moments in which it really flares and sparks particular color in these very dialogue-driven happenings, thus softening the blow of the plot momentum's excessiveness. What further secures the final product as quite a ways away from too exhaustingly overactive is, of course, the subject matter behind the overactive structuring, because although this worthy story's biting depth goes toned down by more plot than story establishment, the fact of the matter is that this subject matter is worthy, rich with, if nothing else, well-researched and highly intelligent legal intrigue that drives the action that drives this film, providing thoroughly fascinating layers and, by extension, engagement to the compelling case around which the story is built. There's a bit too much legal mumbo-jumbo and not quite enough human depth to fully compensate for this film's relatively and gratutiously sprawling runtime, yet Sorkin crafts an intelligently-concieved and eventfully-structured mystery thriller, case and overall conflict, and making it all the stronger with something that I have, throughout this review, justly been stressing is underused: dramatic depth, which should be much more prominent than it is, going diluted as it goes incorporated into the plot and conflict momentum that it should be fleshing out more than being tacked on to, yet still stands firm enough to establish quite a bit of dramatic depth that stands to colorize all of this conflict mumbo-jumbo, but still adds an adequate amount of human weight and consequence in order to keep you reasonably invested. Sorkin could have been more even in his pacing and flesh-out structure, yet on the whole, an undoubtedly compelling stage opus is generally well-translated as a compelling cinematic tale, brought to life by inspiration in the man in charge of truly bringing Sorkin's worthy vision to the screen: director Rob Reiner, whose pacelessness and emphasis on the missteps within Sorkin's script prove problematic, yet does not do too much to undercut what is done right in Reiner's direction, which juices atmosphere with livliness that supplements the intrigue of the legal aspects, keeps consistent entertainment value alive and well, and keeps what true depths that consistently rests within all of the near-exhaustingly underdeveloped happenings to go pronounced just enough to sustain your investment. The off-screen performances are flawed, yet strong enough to keep you going, and considering the caliber of the talents found within this colorful cast, you better believe that the on-screen performances help considerably in keeping you invested. Jack Nicholson is quite underused, yet, as you would expect, steals the show just about every time he steps into the scene as, well, himself yet again, and by extension, an effectively smooth figure, rich with as much mystery as charisma that commands the screen, while everyone else holds their own quite well, with James Marshall and Wolfgang Bodison compelling with believability and the occasional piece of emotional range as the honor-respecting yet fearful accused, Kevin Pollak and Demi Moore charming as our leads' worthy right hands, and leading man Tom Cruise engagingly thoroughly, through charisma and presence, as, well, himself, but also a justice-seeker who will find professional and human experience as he seeks out the truth. These performers and quite a few others grace the film with further color, and with the inspiration within the writing and direction being potent enough to cut through most missteps and establish a compelling core to all of the coloring, the final product comes out flawed, but ultimately worthwhile.\r\n\r\nTo close this case, the film's pacelessness and excessive length bring more to attention the limiting of expository slow-down to the overly eventful plot that would have benefited from more dramatic depth and tightness, yet still ultimately stands as pretty compelling, going complimented by Aaron Sorkin's clever dialogue and intelligently-crafted legal aspects, and brought to life by worthy subject matter and a still reasonable degree of dramatic depth, which are themselves brought to life by Rob Reiner's generally inspired direction, and complimented by the many colorful performances that help in making \"A Few Good Men\" a much more often than not compelling legal thriller.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

Navy Lawyer Lt. Daniel Kaffee is sent to defend the two accused Marines. Its up to Kaffee to prove that these two Marines were ordered to torture the now dead Marine by Col. Nathan Jessup.\n\nTom Cruise plays Kaffee. He has a bunch of really great rants, and Cruise's performance is spectacular. As is Jack Nicholson as Col. Jessup. He really gets to let loose in the final courtroom questioning between Kaffee and Jessup. And the infamous line, \"You can't handle the truth!\" is said in this scene. Nicholson is fantastic. Each and everyone in this cast is incredible, watch for great performances by Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, and Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nOverall, this movie is incredible. It holds your attention throughout. \n\n\"We use words like honor, code, loyalty. We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline.

            "content": "\"A Few Good Men\" was released in the early winter of 1992, directed by Rob Reiner and written by Aaron Sorkin(who also wrote \"The Social Network\" and \"Moneyball\").  This movie is centered on two marines who have been accused of murdering a colleague.  It has been arranged for Kaffee(Tom Cruise) to be their attourney.  Kaffee is portrayed as a lazy and cocky, but well-educated young navy lawyer who is known for being able to set up plea bargains.  However, he discover evidence that these two marines(James Marshall and Wolfgang Bodison) may actually be innocent, so he decides rather to take it to court.  \n\nThis movie is amazing for several reasons.  First let's look at the main actors.  We have Tom Cruise(Kaffee), Demi Moore(JoAnne Galloway), Kevin Bacon(Cpt. Jack Ross), Kiefer Sutherland(Lt. Jonathan Kendrick), Kevin Pollack(Lt. Sam Weinberg) and of course Jack Nicholson(Col. Nathan Jessup).  Need I go any further critiquing?  Did you see the last name I mentioned......Jack Nicholson??  If any of you out there are Nicholson fans, you will not be disappointed by watching this movie.  Now needless to say, Nicholson is not, by any means, the only reason to watch this movie.  He certainly does not steal the film, meaning he does not separate himself from the other actors and what is going on.  Rather, he in only an insignificant number of scenes, seems to suffuse, or permeate the production with authority.  \n\nAnother reason this movie is excellent is becuase it pleads the viewer to ask a serious question.  Is knowledge always the coveted alternative?  This movie will definitely cause you to think hard and long on this question, even after the credits roll.  I love intellectual movies like this one.  If you are the same, then this movie is a must see!\n\nSince I am fair and impartial, I will share with you a reason why some people do not like this film.  The reason is that, this movie is one of those movies which \"tells you what it's going to do, does it, and then tells you what it did.\"  Now this is for sure a good reason to not like a movie.  However,  I personally do not think this causes the movie to lose any flavor, or vitality.  I am simply telling you how some others view it; but you must see this movie for yourself.  It does not detriment the film whatsoever, in my opinion.  \n\nFrom time to time, I will be sharing a rather lengthy quotation from a movie, because I feel that it may genrate a desire in some of the reluctant ones out there.  Those, who are not sure whether they should give a certain movie a venture.  This time is one of those times.  Before reading on I want to inform you that this quote does contain some mild language.  So I  would like to apologize for any of those out there that may be offended upon reading it.  \n\n\"Jessep (Jack Nicholson): You want answers?\nKaffee (Tom Cruise): I think I'm entitled to them.\nJessep: You want answers?\nKaffee: I want the truth!\nJessep: You can't handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: that Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives...You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.\nWe use words like honor, code, loyalty...we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it! I'd rather you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to!\"\n\nThis quotation is towards the climax of the movie, and I will not share any futher information, as to avoid ruining the movie for those who have not yet had the opportunity to watch it.  This excerpt rewards you with a glimpse into the amazing character Jack Nicholson so brilliantly portrayed in this movie.\n\nAs I conclude this article I would like to again go back to the question I posed in the beginning of this article.  Is is the apprehension of knowledge always the covteted alternative?  Well, that is for now; until next time.  I hope you have enjoyed this article on one of my favorite courtroom dramas!  Please share your thoughts on this movie.  I would love to hear from you!",

Brilliant performances from everyone here, the only things I can say is that it was difficult to follow what was happening at times because of the numerous characters and legal dialogue I'm not attuned to.

Aaron Sorkin's story of writing this play, is totally another great story to read, how his sister, who had graduated from Boston University Law School and signed up for a 3-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps. She was going to Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theater on Broadway. \r\n\r\nI found performance by Tom Cruise to be average and usual (except during the climax scene) along with rest of the cast, except Jack Nicholson. Jack brings the vividness to his role, and he fills his role with terrific aggressiveness. Jack dives deeper into his role, bringing exact military rhetoric-tone to his character and personality. Although we have few of his shots in the movie, yet these are the shots which catapult this movie to this extreme level of popularity and, who can forget that taunting quote, uttered by Jack at the very end. \r\n\r\nI could say with great emphasis that the movie is average, and there should not be anymore of fuss about, stretching it to the limit. Marc Shaiman, the music-composer, utilizes grand usage, he creates anxiety and thrill that is surely lifting the hype of scene.\r\n\r\nA whole lot of entertaining movie, that keeps up with its issues, and you would hardly realize the film almost ending!",

I think this is the film that proved to me that Tom Cruise has serious acting talent. Some people give him a hard time because he has gone a little crazy in his personal life, but that shouldn't cause his talent to be discounted. On the opposite side of this film is the always amazing Jack Nicholson, who plays a jerk better than anyone I know (yes, that's a compliment.)\n\nI don't think I've ever watched a better courtroom drama. The story is amazing, and the execution is perfect. There are so many exciting plot twists, and even up to the end they keep the viewers on the edge of their seats.

A Few Good Men has a great leading cast with Tom Cruise (Rain Man, Top Gun) and Jack Nicholson (Chinatown, The Shining) both giving some of their very best performances ever. Cruise plays Lt. JG Daniel Kaffe the lawyer who is defending the two marines on trial for a crime. Cruise's performance is riviting as at first he gives us the impression of the arrogant, and seemingly care free man, it is then you see he is driven, his intensity and ultimately passion for what it is he does. Nicholson in an Oscar nominated performance is amazing as always, every scene he is in he completely steals the show, as the tough as nails, no nonsense Colonel. The film's supporting cast also helped bring the film to life with Demi Moore, Kevin Pollak and Keifer Sutherland. The story was great and also deceptive. The final courtroom scene is the bulk of the film and no doubt the most famous, most passionate and by far had the best scenes of acting capability in the film. The hostility that Cruise and Nicholson had shown for each other in that scene is breathtaking in the famous \"I want the truth!\" \"You can't handle the truth!\" scene. Director Rob Reiner truly helped craft a masterpiece.",

            "content": "\"A Few Good Men\" is a 1992 courtroom drama film Directed by Rob Reiner and starring Tom Cruise. The story follows a young lawyer's plight to defend two marines accused of murder. Now I know just about everyone's heard of this film. If they haven't, they've at least heard of the line, \"You can't handle the truth!\" That line is just a snippet of the greatness that is weaved into this film. Starting off on a related note, the script is fantastic. Aaron Sorkin strikes again with his rapier wit and  compelling dialogue. The story is a very compelling look at the military definitions of honor and loyalty and how they can sometimes become misinterpreted. Some of the lines in this film are also spectacularly memorable. However, while the screenplay is decidedly impressive, the most imposing aspect of this film is the performances within it. Every single actor in this film brought their best to the table, and it's because of the unbelievably captivating performance from Jack Nicholson that everyone else raised their bars. Nicholson's really only in this film for about 10 or 15 minutes, but man does he make those minutes count with his caustic and snide portrayal of Colonel Nathan R. Jessup. Again, it's his performance that caused everyone else in this film to bring their a-games, and holy crap did they. Tom Cruise, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh, Kiefer Sutherland, Demi Moore, all did unbelievable jobs with their respective characters. Even Wolfgang Bodison, a stagehand who had never acted before in his life, did a really beautiful job with his role. The aforementioned fact is a real testament to the seemingly limitless talent of Rob Reiner. After watching the special features of the film, you really get a good idea that Reiner forged an effective relationship with his actors and offered some acting tips of his own for their performances. Because this is such a character driven story, Reiner made a great choice in offering some of his own acting expertise to his cast. Overall, I felt that \"A Few Good Men\" was a really masterfully directed, beautifully written, unforgettably performed coatroom drama that is sure to impress anyone.",

I really cannot do justice to Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Pollak, Jack Nicholson, Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon's lead roles with words, but the best shot I can manage is that the film deserved all those great performances. All these actors managed to breath convincing clarity to their roles, especially the villainous ones (and here I give special commendation to Jack Nicholson).

In my eyes, there is little wrong with the film. \r\nTom Cruise, and company's performances are all great (with the exception of Demi, whose performance is comparatively underwhelming). \r\nThere are certainly plot holes, but the dialogue and performance, in my eyes, make up for it. \r\nGreat movie, great play.",

            "content": "Sometimes, courtroom movies are fun, tense and can be highly entertaining, in an intriguing sense. And sometimes, it can dull, a tad overwhelming and on the brink of alienating the audience with unnecessary twists and turns. One thing is for sure, A Few Good Men has enough to interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten by Aaron Sorkin, you just know this movie is going to be a little above average. Although \"lawyer movies\" have a pretty simple plot (crime, courtroom drama, personal drama, good-yet-predictable ending), the storyline for A Few Good Men emphasizes more on the actors and how well they play their characters. For one, Jack Nicholson, who plays a Col. Nathan R. Jessep on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is as menacing and sinister-looking as ever. From the moment he appears, we just know what kind of character he is playing: himself. And this is where this movie has an advantage; Sorkin's great scripting allows actors to ease themselves into their characters.\r\n\r\nAnyway, what's the case? Two Marines have been accused of murdering a fellow marine (or leatherneck). They require a lawyer to help prove their innocence in the matter, and up steps Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise). He is backed by his colleague, Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollack) and Lt. Commander Joanne (Demi Moore). Kaffee is an overly-confident guy who never really listens to anyone but himself, but does the right thing in the end. Hey, wait a sec, haven't we seen this before? The cocky guy who comes good in the end? Yes, Kaffee is that guy. And not only does Cruise look the part, he plays Kaffee with admirable charisma, something we haven't seen much from him in the past few years or so.\r\n\r\nMoore and Pollack are solid supporting characters, simply put. They manage to assist the plot development well enough, providing tense, intriguing moments of dialogue. On a whole, it is probably the theme that holds the film together. It never once detracts from the justice-is-served motto. The movie also touches on an intriguing minor theme: the duty of a marine to follow the \"Code\". \"We run the business of saving lives,\" as Nicholson puts it. What lengths does one have to endure to serve and protect the country? Does it include absolute loyalty without any questioning? These are some of the questions posed in the movie, and frankly, they were answered, if not as directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThemes are often emphasized in films, more so in A Few Good Men. That is mostly down to Sorkin. He has come up with a courtroom-based script that will be plagiarized shamelessly. I mean, haven't you heard that line \"You want the truth? You can't handle the truth!\" before? \r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally* ... Didn't they have mobile phones in 1992 already?",

Kevin Bacon also does a great job as the tough-as-nails prosecutor who really knows his stuff. The courtroom scenes are fantastic and extremely well-done. The chemisty is great between Cruise and Bacon is very impressive and believable. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in law, politics, or the miliatary.

I realize that many will say that \"If you didn't see the whole thing, you have no right to judge it\" but I say that if a film is still tedious to sit through by the time over an hour has passed, it's not a good movie by any means. A Few Good Men is a very generic court room drama with little depth or originality. It is no different from the countless court room dramas that preceded or followed it, and doesn't compare to the likes of 12 Angry Men, To Kill a Mockingbird, or even The Social Network.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise succeeded in annoying the crap out of me with his typical douchebag persona and Demi Moore's performance felt rather subdued. However, and this may come as no surprise since Jack Nicholson is my favorite living actor, I quite enjoyed Nicholson's performance as Colonel Nathan R. Jessep. Still, I don't think it rank highly on a list of Jack's greatest performances. I still enjoyed him better in The Shining, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Departed, Terms of Endearment and About Schmidt.\r\n\r\nThis film is famed for the line \"You can't handle the truth!\" To be honest, I could handle the truth, just not the boredom that comes along with this generic, overlong court room drama.",

This movie was made by Rob Reiner. Really, after that last statement, need I say more? If you didn't know that Rob Reiner did The Princess Bride, then hang your head in shame now.\n\nIt starts out in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, when a couple marines enter the room of another marine, stuff a rag down his throat, duct tape his mouth shut, duct tape his hands behind his back, duct tape his legs together, and so on. Then the credits roll and we cut to D.C., where we find out that the marine getting gagged and tied died that night. The two marines that were doing the gagging and tying are charged with murder and flown out to D.C.\n\nThe task of lead counsel is assigned to Daniel Kaffee (Cruise), a lieutenant junior grade with a track record for plea bargaining and smooth talking. Lt. Cmdr. Jo Galloway (Moore) is assigned to be co-counsel, despite the fact that she tried to get in as lead counsel. They start the investigation down in Cuba where they meet Col. Nathan Jessup (Nicholson), the man who ordered the two men to give Private Santiago the Code Red, which accidentally led to his death. Of course, Jessup doesn't tell this to Danny or Jo. Why would he? He'd look pretty bad for it, right? So when they get back to D.C. and do some legal maneuvering with their clients and the prosecution, Danny manages to get a deal for a mere two years of prison time, where they are actually home in six months. And the two that are charged turn it down on principle, because they still believe they have done nothing wrong. Danny decides that he wants to get a different lawyer assigned to the case because he doesn't want to go down with them, but then has a change of heart after talking to a few people and thinking about it.\n\nSo the trial starts, and that's when the movie really picks up speed. The skill that Danny has as he strides around the courtroom asking all the right questions and probing in just the right ways is phenomenal. It almost makes you want to be a lawyer.\n\nThere are some major setbacks along the way, some things go right, a lot more go wrong, but eventually everything turns out okay in the end. But like so many movies where we know how it's going to end, it was never really the ending we were banking on, but the fun of getting there.",

            "content": "Starring: Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore This movie is for people who like lawyerly stuff and military type stuff. This movie is an episode of Jag on crack. This movie was made by Rob Reiner. Really, after that last statement, need I say more? If you didn't know that Rob Reiner did The Princess Bride, then hang your head in shame now.\n\nIt starts out in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, when a couple marines enter the room of another marine, stuff a rag down his throat, duct tape his mouth shut, duct tape his hands behind his back, duct tape his legs together, and so on. Then the credits roll and we cut to D.C., where we find out that the marine getting gagged and tied died that night. The two marines that were doing the gagging and tying are charged with murder and flown out to D.C.\n\nThe task of lead counsel is assigned to Daniel Kaffee (Cruise), a lieutenant junior grade with a track record for plea bargaining and smooth talking. Lt. Cmdr. Jo Galloway (Moore) is assigned to be co-counsel, despite the fact that she tried to get in as lead counsel. They start the investigation down in Cuba where they meet Col. Nathan Jessup (Nicholson), the man who ordered the two men to give Private Santiago the Code Red, which accidentally led to his death. Of course, Jessup doesn't tell this to Danny or Jo. Why would he? He'd look pretty bad for it, right? So when they get back to D.C. and do some legal maneuvering with their clients and the prosecution, Danny manages to get a deal for a mere two years of prison time, where they are actually home in six months. And the two that are charged turn it down on principle, because they still believe they have done nothing wrong. Danny decides that he wants to get a different lawyer assigned to the case because he doesn't want to go down with them, but then has a change of heart after talking to a few people and thinking about it.\n\nSo the trial starts, and that's when the movie really picks up speed. The skill that Danny has as he strides around the courtroom asking all the right questions and probing in just the right ways is phenomenal. It almost makes you want to be a lawyer.\n\nThere are some major setbacks along the way, some things go right, a lot more go wrong, but eventually everything turns out okay in the end. But like so many movies where we know how it's going to end, it was never really the ending we were banking on, but the fun of getting there.\n\nBottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",

Of course, Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men was quite a popular movie back in 1992. But what a movie it is!\nTwo Army lieutenants stationed out at Guatanamo Bay are charged with the murder of one of their own. Tom Cruise and Demi Moore play two hot shot Navy officers charged with defending the case. What looks on the surface as an open and shut plea bargain becomes a complex and disturbing look at what it takes to be a soldier under the most extreme and life threatening of conditions.\nI can't say any more about this movie. Everything works. The film is a masterpiece and one of the best legal dramas. Tom Cruise is fantastic as the arrogant defense lawyer and Jack Nicholson plays his perfect opponent as the lieutenants' Colonel. The scene that they share together is completely epic and one of the most tense courtroom scenes ever filmed.",

This is his best performance. However, Rob Reiner's Nostalgia takes advantage of Aaron Sorkin's impeccable writing and nearly ruins the film. After Jack Nicholson erupts there is suddenly a barrage of incredibly cheesy lines. Particularly for 1992. I suspect Reiner wanted it to feel classic so much that he entirely stuck to that same old school formula. The film didn't break new ground because Reiner held it back. This is not a happy story and he had no artistic reason to make it feel so 1960's. It is a dark film and the photography is colorful. In the context of the script; much of the production design is tone def. It is incredibly frustrating for me. I'm glad Sorkin found the right Auteur for his second masterpiece.",
