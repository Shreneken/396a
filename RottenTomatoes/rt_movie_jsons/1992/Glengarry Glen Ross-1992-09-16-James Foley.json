    "summary": "When an office full of New York City real estate salesmen is given the news that all but the top two will be fired at the end of the week, the atmosphere begins to heat up. Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon), who has a sick daughter, does everything in his power to get better leads from his boss, John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), but to no avail. When his coworker Dave Moss (Ed Harris) comes up with a plan to steal the leads, things get complicated for the tough-talking salesmen.",

The film contains one of the most icon film scenes of the last half of the the 20th Century-courtesy of Alec Baldwin.  Jack Lemmon is very sympathetic as the aging salesman desperate to close some leads.  A young Kevin Spacey is memorable as the young office manager trying to manage his ambitions against the tide of crazed salespeople.  Ed Harris and Alan Arkin are very good in this as a scheming loser and his accomplice.   Al Pacino is almost hypnotic as a successful salesman with great complexity.  For Alec Baldwin this one of the most memorable of his career.   The dialogue is sharp.  The Direction is good but it is the performances that make this a great movie.  This one holds up.",

Calling to mind the general mood of 12 Angry Men, the film treats us to a blistering display of the raging, frustrated antics of several desperately harried real estate salesman as they mercilessly joust for position, success and ultimately respect. Lent a bemusing air of sophistication by a cool and dispassionate jazz score, the verbal outpourings of the ensemble cast reach heights that both stun and amuse, achieving the rare and impressive feat of intense melodrama that buoys the spirits instead of dampening them. We may have little affection for the sleazy and corrupt salesmen occupying center stage, but we marvel at the brutality of circumstances that might yield sympathy for even the most craven of con-artists. This sets up an engaging dynamic wherein we invest ourselves in the turbulent fortunes of scoundrels, ever delighting in the ongoing process of events regardless of eventual outcomes. A classic albeit mercilessly profane depiction of the failure of the American Dream in perfect microcosm.",

Its a film you can watch again and again because of the many memorable moments that stick with you forever. Alec Baldwin's cameo is one of a kind while Jack Lemmon takes centerstage with his charming innovative sales pitches. The only downside that diminished the rating for me personally was Al Pacino's inappropriately disturbing dialogue at the Bar where the film lost momentum.Unfortunately for that reason I can only give this film 4 1/2 instead of 5 stars.Otherwise this is a picture perfect presentation of  Sales men struggling to reach the top at a dead end job for Con Artists. Every character was colorfully portrayed as well as highly impressive to watch. If you enjoy witty banter or simply need a movie to help you unwind after a long stressful day at the office. This is the go to Cinematic masterpiece that will make anyone feel thankful for their job no matter how rough a day you might have.",

Jack Lemmon received great praise for his performance, but really just plays the same stammering character that he played for the last twenty years of his career.  The real star of the film is David Mamet, whose phenomenal screenplay defines the characters and their motivations and regularly swings from touching to profanely intense in a matter of seconds.

Lemmon in particular is an acting powerhouse, swinging from downtrodden but resilient, to self-satisfied and bravado-pumped, and ultimately to heartbreakingly defeated; Pacino, Harris, Spacey, and Pryce are each exceedingly well matched to the script as well. The slimy nature of the salesman is on full display in gratuitous detail, and any fan of dialogue-driven drama would be doing themselves a disservice by missing this classic. (4.5/5)",

He is filled with such passion and rage, but the one thing he is lacking is fucks. Blake has zero fucks to give about anyoneâ(TM)s feelings or their jobs. âFuck you, thatâ(TM)s my name!â? he screams at someone thinking they will get the upperhand on him. Classic.\n\nCharacters: 10\nAside from Blake, the rest of the characters add depth to the movie. With their different personalities, each character has a distinctly different approach to the way that they sell and go about winning. Their choices and reactions hold sway over which direction the movie turns and what the audience thinks is going to happen next. As things unfold and they end up being questioned by the Detective (Jude Ciccolella), itâ(TM)s interesting to watch them have different responses to the pressure.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 9\nI love the cinematic work here. The entire film has a dreary feel, almost like thereâ(TM)s a fog being cast over the characters and their dilemma. The light comes in small glimpses and you mostly see rain throughout. It has a suffocating feel, adding even more certainty that the characters are resigned to their own fate.\n\nConflict: 10\nLook, Iâ(TM)m in sales and few things institute conflict like sales situations. Tell a bunch of guys that they either hit their numbers or theyâ(TM)re fired and thereâ(TM)s bound to be problems. As the film drags on, the desperation becomes even heavier. You feel for these guys, but not so much so that you donâ(TM)t get the enjoyment of watching them crumble in high pressure situations. As douchey as it sounds, itâ(TM)s actually kind of fun.\n\nGenre: 7\n\nMemorability: 7\n\nPace: 10\nOnce Blake enters the scene, the movie maintains its pace from start to finish. Fueled by conflict and desperation, the characters ultimately create a mystery that you want to get to the bottom of before the movie reaches its end. Itâ(TM)s refreshing when you watch a movie that doesnâ(TM)t have any dead spots and director James Foley succeeded in making that a reality.\n\nPlot: 10\nWhat happens when you put a bunch of different personalities in a room and tell them they have a certain amount of time to complete a goal or else? The story is ultimately moved by how people respond to pressure situations. I can imagine when this was written, the direction may have changed directions a couple of times due to the personalities of the characters. Memorable characters can alter the direction of a plot for the sake of staying true to the characters.\n\nResolution: 4\n\nOverall: 87\nI hadnâ(TM)t even heard of this movie until a couple of years ago. Itâ(TM)s funny, this movie was recommended to me by a Sales Manager who thought, âThis is how the sales team should go after it!â? After watching it, I thought, âThis isnâ(TM)t how selling should be at all!â? Glengarry Glen Ross succeeds because it appeals to people for different reasons. Some see it as a cautionary tale while others view it as inspiration. I am in the camp of the former. Iâ(TM)m also in the popular majority that think the movie is awesome.",

I thought maybe we could get to the bottom of what this company really is, though we certainly can imagine along the way that they are crooks.  It would've been nice to see the police, after long enough exposure to this office, want to open an investigation on their business practices.\n\nAlan Arkin does a wonderful job as the benign George, who amenably reiterates whatever Dave (Ed Harris) says.  We get a sense he's been at this job a long time, hasn't ever gotten ahead, doesn't have enough wisdom to converse with the younger Dave, but is almost willing to blindly follow him for lack of his own direction.\n\nJack Lemmon as Shelley and Al Pacino as Ricky Roma are the two standout performances, and we are treated to a great interaction between them after Shelley finally gets off a big sale.  The interaction ups the ante when Roma's client comes in, the nervous pushover James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce), Shelley and Roma playing a faux client/salesman con to sell Roma as a busy important man.  Roma is trying to push Lingk out of the office to keep him from withdrawing his sale - Roma is held onto the lie that Lingk's check hasn't been cashed yet, is secure, and can be returned.  Kevin Spacey's young and ignorant John Williamson comes in and screws the whole thing up, misreading the situation, informing Lingk that his check has been cashed and all is well.  What follows is Roma's verbal beatdown of Williamson, making up the raw intensity aforementioned.  \n\nEverybody hates Williamson after he brings in the negatively charged motivational speaker Blake (Alec Baldwin) to threaten that the lowest earner will be fired.  Roma is the standard to meet, and he's got pull over Williamson.  His berating of Williamson is something everyone wants to see, especially since Williamson had been hard on the vet Shelley, giving him and everyone else poor leads.  \n\nThe plot develops when these top leads, which only Roma gets, become the target of everyone in the office, and since nobody will give them up, plans develop to steal them.  It starts with Dave trying to convince George to do it - they will sell them off to another company and make a profit for their efforts.  But even George is leery about this, second guessing it.  All we know is that the next day, the leads have been successfully stolen, and the police are investigating.  We suspect George based on the nervous way he acts, but he's nervous to begin with.  It's likely Dave is involved no matter what, the guy is always lit without a fill.  And then there's the way Shelley is acting, overly celebratory about his latest sale that gets him up on the board.\n\nThe scope is limited, but Foley handles it nicely.  I like the way this part of New York looks, has a studio backlot old Hollywood feel to it.  Blue light lands on several of the characters, Shelley in phone booths.  The Chinese restaurant, with it's red lining and open space, provides a hospitable habitat for these workers to relax and stretch.  I love the way the train passes in the rain as Shelley crosses the street, Dunkin' Donuts dull in the background.  We feel this is a deadbeat part of town, a perfect allusion to the lives of the people working in it.",

You somehow find yourself dying for a poor schmuck to get tricked into accepting a real estate deal that he probably can't afford and doesn't want in the first place, simply because we want to see the salesman get a win. The script gets some of the credit for that aspect, but I think even more of the credit has to go to the amazing cast of actors. Each one of these guys can pull off so much in their performances that you can simultaneously hate their actions and yet like them as people. I think the empathy is formed throughout the film, but it is amplified in the scene where Alec Baldwin outdoes himself with one of the most ridiculous and yet amazing speeches in movie history. This raises the stakes for the rest of the characters and does a great job of giving us a vision of who is the real bad guy. No matter how bad the other characters behave we understand because at least they aren't like Blake. Kevin Spacey was perfect as the manager who could be in over his head with all these salesmen that have more experience than him, and yet he holds his own and can give it back as easily as they dish the punishment out. Al Pacino, Alan Arkiin, Ed Harris, and Jonathan Pryce all crush their performances as well. I could just go on and on about every single person in the cast, but instead I'll just focus in on how totally awesome Jack Lemmon is in Glengarry Glen Ross. I don't have words for the perfection in his performance. In each conversation he shifts to the situation and perfectly shows us the quality of his sales skills, and yet we can always sense the underlying despair that drives him. There's not much else to talk about with this film because it is almost 100% character driven, and the plot is rather basic. I enjoyed the film, and can see why it is critically praised, I'd certainly recommend it to others for a good example of an acting tour-de-force.",

The cinematography and sound really add layers to the movie that really only takes place in one location and makes it like you are in the office with them rather than watching the play it is based off of. This seems like one of those pieces that inspired Aaron Sorkin with the amount of intelligent conversions. It's really great though sometimes it gets exhausting",

            "content": "Well hello boys and girls. \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. From beginning to end you are hooked to this movie because of it's sharp and quick paced dialogue that comes out of all these great actors in this movie. every single actor brings their A game in this movie and I mean every single actor. From Al Pacino who steals the spotlight, Jack Lemmon who i really need to start getting into, Alec Baldwin even though it's more of a cameo/small role, is the star of this movie. Ed Harris as always is a great force to not be messed with, Alan Arkin who is always a great presence in the movies and Kevin Spacey who is always on his A game no matter what as the man literally lives to act. The movie is directed by James Foley who directs all these actors with great force in this tense movie about the hard goings in the reel estate business. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, and Alan Arkin are all the verge of losing their jobs as the leads they have been given by their boss Kevin Spacey and their employees Mitch & Murray even though you never see them or hear from them in the film, the name is enough to let you know they are not to be messed with. Alec Baldwin makes a big cameo role as the sales motivator who tells Pacino, Lemmon, Arkin and Harris that they all one week to reclaim their jobs and that they are worthless pieces of shit for the most part, but Pacino is not present during this famous scene in the film which is the best part of the movie, because he's across the street at the Chinese restaurant getting drunk with Jonathan Price during a sales pitch he's trying to wee on Price. But Baldwin nails his role as he literally breaks right into these guys and letting them know it take brass balls to sell reel estate and that if they can't sell with the leads they have been given, they are shit. He's awesome, just awesome. So awesome in fact I kind of which he came back into the movie just for a few more seconds just to see how the rest of the cast is making out after he literally breaks into them with his lecture, he's that good. Alec Baldwin is so extremely underrated as an actor that I feel at times besides his awesome turn in \"30 Rock\" that he doesn't get enough great roles like this one. Besides \"The Cooler\" which I say is his best performance which he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor as the casino manager with mob ties in Las Vegas, Baldwin definitely deserves more than he is given. But the man that literally keeps you watching the movie after Baldwin exits the screen is the great Al Pacino who makes acting look so easy that you yourself would want a crack at it. He really is one of the greatest actors that has ever lived as he just has such a natural flow to him as an actor that you just can't help but be automatically drawn to him because it's fucking Al Pacino. \"The Godfather Part 1 & 2,\" \"Serpico,\" \"Dog Day Afternoon,\" \"Heat,\" \"Carlito's Way,\" \"Scent of a Woman,\" you name it, it's a classic because of Al Pacino. Pacino was nominated best supporting actor for the movie and he rightfully deserved it as he is literally like I said the driving force that keeps the movie going, but really the credit is due to all the actors as they all have their awesome moments in the movie. Especially Jack Lemmon who I regret I have not seen enough of his movies, but I am definitely going to change that as of right now as he is literally a striving talent that all has such a passion for acting like Pacino that you just want to be right beside him with the director as your watching Lemmon act as he steps up to the plate and gets tough BIG time like Pacino, but in his own classic Lemmon way. Kevin Spacey too gives it right back as the boss of these guys as even though he is looked at as the young boss who doesn't know shit in this movie, he literally lets these guys know he is not to be fucked with. I love Kevin Spacey he is seriously growing as one of my favorite actors as I literally cannot get enough of him in \"House of Cards\" which he is just fantastic in that. Ed Harris and Alan Arkin also give exceptionally great performances as well as I believe everybody should have been nominated for an Oscar in this movie as they are all FUCKING AWESOME!!!! It takes great skill to command a bunch of power house actors like this and that is why I commend James Foley who literally deserves most of the credit, because if you can handle these guys...you can handle anyone.",

Sure, sales people often feel fake and sketchy and pushy in real life, but that sense of \"authenticity\" didn't feel authentic at all to me. Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul is a scam artist too, but the way he's played by Bob Odenkirk and written by Vince Gilligan and his writing team is far and above better than David Mamet's over-the-top characters in this boring mess.

The script from David Mamet, based on his stage play, sparkles with dialogue that needs to be heard to be believed.  It is profane, but in a way that brings the words to a more abrupt and deliberate uncomfortable level.\r\n\r\nThe film stars Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, and Jonathan Pryce.  These guys are spot on.  There isn't a bad moment amongst them.  The desparation and panic, as well as the gloating heighten each scene.\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple.  Several men, working for a real estate sales organization are dumped with a pile of good and bad leads.  Those leads could make or break them.  The one who sells the most before the next day continues to work there and wins a car.  The bottom in sales is fired.\r\n\r\nThe interaction between the characters and the actors is vital.  The film would not work otherwise.  It is those moments that drives the picture.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/GlengarryGlenRoss_zps1b90762c.jpg[/IMG]",

Now this was always one of those films that I had always heard great things about, but never actually found the time to sit down and watch, until now.  To say this is star-studded would be an understatement; you look at the cast list, and you see nothing but heavyweights like Jonathan Pryce, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin, Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino.  They all manage to elevate an already tight script penned by David Mamet, whose writing really is the star here.  Abbreviated on paper, this is just 100 minutes of salesmen talking about leads, but when brought to life, it really is something special.  You can totally tell that this was a stage play previously, simply based on the parameters of how the story advances, but that is in no way a mark against it; some of the best stories can exist in both worlds, and you can always look at the classic 12 Angry Men if you need further proof.  It is a story that makes you feel disgusted about how sales work, but it is fascinating to get to know the character of Shelley Levene; Jack Lemmon plays him in such a way that you feel bad for him, all the while you're repulsed by his actions.  I would never want to be a salesman (or associate myself with one, for that matter) but Glengarry Glen Ross has a script that speaks for itself, and features dialogue with cadence and rhythm.",

What I liked the most about this movie, besides everything mentioned, is that if a character said they were going to go away, they did, that might not sound like much but the movie was realistic and just because a big named actor left the area in which this movie took place it doesn't mean we have to see them in the new area, a) because it isn't important, b) it doesn't play up to their egos and that's why only some characters are on screen total for a few minutes because they served their purpose and they had to leave or when a character says they're not going to show up for something, well, that's the last we hear from them in awhile. The movie tries to go for a realistic tone throughout the entire thing and I'd say the filmmakers accomplish this tremendously because even though throughout the film the levels of tension and anger increase exponentially there is still dark comedy thrown in every now and then, just like in real life, no matter how dark and sad a situation is, a funny thing will happen in life whether you're happy or not, that's just how things go. Besides all of that it's just fun to see big name actors just tear into each other for 2 hours; totally not the point of the movie but it's another point in it's favor.",

They work at Consolidated Real Estate in Arizona.  Their line manager is John; those above John brought in Blake to put a fire under these four.  So the re-working of their work life consists of a contest.  In two weeks, whoever comes in first in sales get a Cadillac.  Who comes in second gets a set of steak knives.  The other two get fired.\n\n    The common complaint is the availability of leads; that is, connections to a likely real estate sales that is worth a lot of money.  With Consolidated Real Estate, they get leads that are dubious and re-worked.  Shelley appeals directly to John for the premium leads, the 'Glengarry' leads.  He tries to construct a kickback scheme with John to get the Glengarry leads.\n\n    Dave and George do a lot of complaining, then consider robbing the office to get the Glengarry leads directly, then sell then to a competitor.  Ricky schmoozes James at length, and closes a deal.\n\n    The robbery does occur, and there is a great deal of consternation at the office.  The Detective is doing interviews.  Contracts and some of the leads have been stolen.  Ricky's deal with James got registered with the company and the bank, or at least that's what John tells Ricky.  Shelley comes in a little late and is so happy to have sold 8 units in a development.  Dave blows up and leaves after his interview with the Detective.  George gets interviewed next.  Ricky and Shelley swap war stories.\n\n    James tries to get out of his deal with Ricky.  Ricky and Shelley try to fast talk him out of this.  Ricky manages some quality talking time while the Detective interviews Shelley.  John manages to torpedo the deal.  Ricky is not happy with John.  Nobody does anything but abuse John.\n\n    Will the thief be discovered?  Will any of these four salesmen get their act together again?\n\n------Scores------\n\n    Cinematography: 10/10 No problems.  Nicely shot.\n\n    Sound: 10/10 Well-miked actors; no problems understanding the dialog with the sound at a reasonable volume.

The fine story is made better by the excellent acting.\n\n    Screenplay: 10/10 Mamet's story is riveting with these actors executing brilliantly.",

I missed it in the cinemas in the 90's - I was building a new house and there was a gap of few years regarding movies. \r\n\r\nThe film depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen and how they become desperate when the corporate office sends a trainer to \"motivate\" them by announcing that, in one week, all except the top two salesmen will be fired. The film is notorious for its use of profanity, leading the cast to jokingly refer to the film as \"Death of a Fuc*in' Salesman\". The title of the film comes from the names of two of the real estate developments being peddled by the salesmen characters: Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms. The world premiere of Glengarry Glen Ross was held at the Venice Film Festival, where Jack Lemmon, one of the film's stars, was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. And I have to say his performance was a top act. I liked Al Pacino's work as well - he was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his work in the film.\r\n\r\nBut, I have to ask - what else was a top act in this movie except acting? Directing? What was top there? Which scene can you remember as outstanding? What about the screenplay? There was some suspense and drama, but at the end it was mostly \"talk\" - without the actual \"walk\"! The film's photography relied on low lighting and shadows with a blues, greens, and reds colour scheme for the first part of the film, while the second half was monochromatic blue-grey colour scheme - and that's it. I have nothing against simplicity, completely opposite, but there must be something outstanding that I could rate a movie 100%! It was a good movie to watch... and I saw it... once is enough. Maybe I've seen too many movies, and even if I enjoyed this one in general, there was no \"special\" effect on me! The film was not a commercial success, making only $10.7 million in North America, just below its $12.5 million budget.",

Al Pacino can take no blame as he was he usual charismatic and engaging best. Kevin Spacey was also influential.

Starring AL PACINO, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey. Film was premiered at Venice Film Festival, where Jack Lemmon received Volpi Cup award for Best Actor. Made with the budget of just $12.5 million - Al Pacino received Best Supporting Actor nominations at two different prestigious Academy Award, and Golden Globe. \r\n\r\nOn a rainy-day events occur inside the office of real-estate -occupied by salesmen Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and upper-heads Kevin Spacey and AL PACINO. Kevin Spacey is the manager who runs the affair and makes sure to implement commands. Kevin also has to deal with worsening scenario after visiting downtown hotshot slick Alec Baldwin warns them (rather in threatening manner) to reach target of property-sale in time or else lose their job. Alec hands packet of leads (names of sure-purchasing-parties) to Kevin and for Pacino (not present in the screen, yet).\r\n\r\nIt is said, that movie was made just like stage-drama, even actors who were yet to appear in scene, voluntarily showed up during other actors' performances. The movie is famous for bringing on stage versatile actors of their times, all together - and important thing is that the movie contains powerful dialogues, from those who are quite experienced at doing so. Of all, only Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon appear to have honestly dedicated to bring justification to film's crucial subject. To me, Al Pacino's performance at near climax shook me up, during Pacino's confrontation with Kevin, taking marvelous use of dialogue-delivery and pace of timing. \r\n\r\nOliver Stone's Wall-Street, like films introduced us to greed at top-level, and here we are seeing the ground-realities as suffered by ordinary fellas - neither of who are immunized to plague of deception and greed.",

A group of aging real estate salesmen-sales leader Roma (Al Pacino), Levene (Jack Lemmon), Moss (Ed Harris), Aaranow (Alan Arkin)--are having trouble with closing deals, so young office manager Williamson (Kevin Spacey) has arranged for a meeting with self-involved higher-up (Alec Baldwin) to \"motivate\" the salesmen in solving their problems. The solution: the person with the greatest sales wins a car, while the two persons with the worst sales are fired. This meeting consists mostly of a biting monologue literally written for Baldwin that would put any worker in his place. This leads to a desperate hunt for leads, the most baffling attempt being a burglary of their own office for \"Glengarry leads,\" which are leads that are essentially guaranteed sales. The film acts as a canvas for the five stages of grief. Levene bargains for any opportunity that can feed his family, Moss spits on those higher in power for telling him that he cannot make a sale and is ready to fight back, Aaranow harshly doubts his ability to make a deal, and Roma simply continues with his business, worry-free. I have never seen the play on which this film is based, but some speeches seem improvised because of all of the fucks given. I bet I could re-watch many of the scenes in this film without getting sick of them. Every actor performs so engagingly for a story that, otherwise, could run dry for those not too interested in marketing. Such performances are so engaging partially because the film's respect for every character's despicably selfish acts committed for universally selfish reasons.",

How loud can you shout?  A script that calls for this kind of work is perfect for Al Pacino. He plays Romo, the office's top real estate salesman. Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, and Kevin Spacey are all vultures squawking at each other to determine who is going to get the biggest piece of meat. \"The Leads\" are what they are all after. Each man sits and stares in silent amazement as the boss Alec Baldwin shits on everyone in the office and hands the leads over to office supervisor Kevin Spacey. These office jerks obsess over these leads, plot to steal and kill over these leads, betray each other over these leads-all for the love of their job? How can that be? They behave like addicts scrapping to get that last pull from the pipe until they encounter real people, then its showtime and they have to front like they have no problems whatsoever. \nI just returned from a vacation that involved a few mandatory hours of sitting with a handful of real estate salesmen to listen to their pleas. After long hours of nonsense, they finally let us leave. This movie shows the true colors of some of these salesmen and heavily exaggerates what their behavior and relationships might be in the office. Grimy capitalist salesmen, trying to lie their way to the top ranks thinking about themselves and themselves only. \nIf your workplace is full of morons or you hate your boss and you just wish you could speak freely to their face, then watching this movie might do something for you. There is literally no holds barred in this script and people are humiliated. \nA few random mentions: \n\tAlec Baldwin appeared early and was great. I would have liked to see one more appearance towards the end but he never showed up ? \n\tJack Lemmon's character Shelly I believe was the motivation behind Simpsons' character \"Gill\". Poor ole Gill...\n\tKevin Spacey took the grunt of mostly everyone's shit. He is an easy target, as he gets shitted on in 75% of the movies he's in. \n\tEd Harris and Alan Arkin were (meh), and Al Pacino was hilarious! Very memorable performance for Pacino in his very longstanding acting career. \n\n4/5",

They're for closers.\n\n\"A Story For Everyone Who Works For A Living.\"\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross is one of those movies that has been on my need to see list for sometime now. Now, that I've finally got around to seeing it, I can fully understand why it's regarded as a classic. It is, without a doubt, a great film. It's a performance film and it's a workplace film, and both aspects are handled perfectly. I guess it always helps a movie that is so dependent on performances when you are able to assemble a cast as good as this one. \n\nFour salesmen at a reality firm are given an ultimatum by some guy that comes in from downtown to fire them up. Either sell or get fired. But the employees don't believe they can sell because all the leads they are getting are old and worthless. The prized leads are only given out to those who can sell says the man. Then we follow those four through their night and morning. \n\nAs I said, this movie is almost 100 percent based on the performances of its cast. The four salesman are played by: Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, Jack Lemmon, and Ed Harris. The man who runs the office is played by Kevin Spacey, and the man who comes into fire them up is played by Alec Baldwin. So the cast is pretty fucking good. There's no clear standout, as they are all amazing, but surprisingly my favorite performance was turned in by Alec Baldwin as Blake. He may have only been on screen for five to ten minutes, but it was my favorite part of the film.\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross is a movie every film buff should see. The dialogue is brilliant, as are the performances. It's a fun movie, with serious themes. I was completely entertained from start to finish by the actors. Sometimes conversation movies like this don't make the complete runtime entertaining. There's lows in most of these type of films. This one was all highs though.",

Poi arriva Alec Baldwin che, pur essendo l'anello debole della catena insieme ad Arkin (trascurabile ques'ultimo), ti sfoggia un prototipo di venditore aggressivo mica da ridere. Kevin Spacey parte in sordina, sembra intorpidito, però alla fine... che te lo dico a fare, la classe viene fuori alla grande.\nE poi c'è il grandissimo dialogo-scontro tra Ed Harris e Al Pacino, che quasi da solo vale tutto il film e introduce alla grandissima interpretazione finale ancora di Jack Lemmon, che chiude la pellicola alla grande e consegna alla storia un personaggio, quello del venditore che ha fatto il suo tempo, che verrà riutilizzato come cliché in tantissime produzioni a seguire.\nQuel che rimane è una narrazione forse un pò sbilenca, ma un pugno di personaggi incredibilmente vivi grazie a quel tocco di personalità che ogni attore ha dato ad ognuno di loro.",

A lie ! At most it saved me 10% on my electric bill. \n\n(2) One from Sears floor installation wasted hours of my time, pitching its product, but not reviling the price. When I was quoted over 10K , or 50%+ higher than other contractors, I was told if I would sign the contract today he would knock $500 off the price, I told him I couldn't afford since I have dental work to do. Then he told me that by saving me those $500 I can afford to do my dental work. I sarcastically rebuked him that I could save so much money that't I'll go broke ! So if not technically a lie, it's definitely a manipulation, especially of those who are not good at personal finance. \n\n(3) The owner of a shabby modeling agency, disingenuously told me I am talented & presentable enough to have a 90% chance a year of getting a paid role. When I resisted to sing-up because I didn't have money at hand, and wanted to leave, he pressured me by personally driving to a bank & withdraw $300 for his service. Almost several years later, I was called only a couple of times for unsuccessful auditions (with dozens of other candidates present). Since 2011, I haven't been contacted even once for an audition. Had he been honest, he would have told my chances of getting a paid gig would have amounted to way less than a 90% chance a year. And/or he was not representing me diligently, since I've haven't heard from him since 2011. He also misrepresented that I can deduct the $300 agency fee from my taxes, when in fact that required me to have had income related to modeling, and that I wasn't simply able to deduct it from my regular income as he was suggesting.",

            "content": "With Al Pacino giving another Academy Award nominated performance, Glengarry Glen Ross sounded like it would be an entertaining feature.\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross maintains a lot of the strength that made the source material of the play terrific. Filmed and acted as if it is a stage production, Glengarry Glen Ross maintains the strength and drama of being a stage play and follows the appropriate style to do so. It has a few aspects which make it more technically valuable, but as a whole the approach that director James Foley takes to the material makes it seem largely like the play it is written as. It is filmed with simple cinematography techniques, shots which stand in one position and go on for an extensive period of time as they depict the conversations of the actors unfolding naturally as if the viewer is actually there to witness it. It gives the film a sense of realism and genuity which is where a lot of the effectiveness comes into play since there is little required aside from the acting and the natural material of the screenplay to create the drama. There are some slight moments involving a musical score, but they are not common as the drama in the film is consistently organic. Glengarry Glen Ross is strong because of its dramatic roots and due to the fact that its screenplay carries the material over easily to film thanks to the way that James Foley handles it as director. It is a prime example of a great film adaptation of a play, and it maintains a good style but never lets it get in the way of the more organically positive aspects of the material. Admittedly, Glengarry Glen Ross is not a film for everyone because it is a slow burning and simple story which is more relevant to its stage material than to being a film and so people looking for film more than simply a play could find it to be boring. There were many times that I felt this because it is difficult for me to be pleased by stage productions and I have a higher expectation for what films have to offer due to the fact that they offer increased potential and higher technical qualities, and since Glengarry Glen Ross stays so simplistic with its style I found that the affect of it was not as great as it could have been. To put it simply, Glengarry Glen Ross is a lot like a stage play filmed and put on screen as a feature film, and it maintains essentially all the aspects of a play, for better and for worse.\nIn terms of narrative, the other central flaw in Glengarry Glen Ross is the fact that it has so many characters. The most essential to the plot are Ricky Roma, Shelley \"The Machine\" Levene and John Williamson.  But as their stories are being told, there are so many others who come into play yet represent nothing but subplots in the story. There are only a select handful of characters in Glengarry Glen Ross, but the material gives them all very predominant roles in the film. They are all interesting to a certain extent and are well acted figures, but their actual relevance to the story proves to be nothing more than a distraction from the major premise at heart. So Glengarry Glen Ross remains a simple and small scaled film but has a surplus of characters to focus on. \nStill, Glengarry Glen Ross succeeds on the basis of the fact that its screenplay is full of well written language and complex plot dynamics, and the fact that Glengarry Glen Ross has a seriously talented cast lined up. The actors in Glengarry Glen Ross  are truly its most major benefit.\nAl Pacino pulls off another essential performance in Glengarry Glen Ross. The thing about him this time is that subtlety is key to his character in the way that he maintains a lot of inner wisdom which he projects without having to shout it. He delivers his lines with a lean strength which all comes from within as it is clear that his performance has a lot of depth to it. He plays games with all of the characters and interacts with the others in such a strong way which has viewers constantly intruiged as to who he is and what he is hiding. Al Pacino's supporting performance in Glengarry Glen Ross shows a lot of his understated talents and it is a role which is like none he has ever played before. Al Pacino is the screen stealer in Glengarry Glen Ross because he speaks his words in a way which makes his character so interesting and interacts with the other cast members so powerfully, including one defining scene where he comes to blows with Kevin Spacey towards the end of the film. Glengarry Glen Ross gives Al Pacino a chance to act mostly through the simple technique of his line delivery, and it is no surprise that he comes off well.\nJack Lemmon is terrific in Glengarry Glen Ross because he is such a likeable figure. He is swift in his abilities at line delivery and technique for character acting, and he defies the manipulative archetype of the salesman figure by playing one who struggles so much but remains constantly determined to succeed and having the audience believe that he is avoiding use of tricky tactics to make it happen. He uses some shady techniques, but in comparison to the many others he is in competition in, Jack Lemmon is able to maintain a naturally likable persona due to how he plays with the character. He has audiences sympathizing for him a lot of the time, even when he plays games with the audience and only tells half-truths. And in that sense, he is able to cleverly trick audiences into liking the facade he puts on and the actual person that he is playing. Jack Lemmon conveys the struggles of being in business very well and constantly delivers his lines with a want to draw the audience in, and it works because he captivates the interest of viewers and gives a performance which has a lot of steady power to it.\nKevin Spacey gives an excellent performance as well. From early on in his career from before he earned such worldwide recognition, Kevin Spacey gives a firm and cold-hearted supporting performance in Glengarry Glen Ross which further conveys the harsh reality of business. He is swift and merciless into ensuring that things move along according to his vision, and so his character development is essential to the progression of the narrative.\nAlec Baldwin doesn't get as much screen time as one might hope, but during his brief appearance he makes a memorable and effective impact. Ed Harris and Alan Arkin also deliver strong supporting performances.\n\nSo although Glengarry Glen Ross is a bit too much of a play to have the impact of a film, the strength of its screenplay and efforts of its incredible cast make it a difficult feature not to admire.",

While driving, Moss conspires to rob the office of the Glengarry leads, putting Aaronow in a tough position. Finally, there is Ricky Roma (the legend that is Al Pacino), a hot-shot that isn't present for the revelation, as he is too busy wooing a client with his put-on philosophies, and slick charm. On top of that fantastic foursome, there is there young manager, John Williamson (Kevin Spacey, before either of his Oscar wins), the smarmy superior, who has the Glengarry leads. As the night, and following morning progress, we are treated to the different character arcs, relations, and revelations. Various characters reveal more about themselves, and the situation, through the brilliant, biting screenplay.\r\n\r\nPositives: So many. The film is dominated by five fantastic lead actors, each getting enough development, and moments to remain in the viewers minds, long after seeing the film. Al Pacino's portrayal of Ricky, as a slick, smooth salesman who can wrap any client around his finger, masks a desperation, that comes out when he finds himself in a corner. This multifaceted portrayal owes it's debt to the fantastic screenplay, and Pacino's absorption into the role. Then there is Moss. Ed Harris was one of the lesser well-known guys in the film, but he absolutely dominates every time he speaks. His brash, loudmouth persona serve to highlight the times where he can't walk the walk, or is unable to follow up a spur-of-the-moment comment, and ends up getting destroyed by the likes of Blake.  To contrast the big-mouthed Moss, we have the reserved, nervous Aaronow, who is unable to stand on his own two feet, and is taken in by Moss' smooth-talking. Arkin's portrayal of Aaronow is probably the least note-worthy performance in the film, but it is still an absolute masterclass, putting many actors today to shame. Moving onto the two supporting characters, we have Williamson, played by the at-the-time upcoming talent Kevin Spacey. Williamson is snide, bitter, and resentful of his employees, as they think themselves more experienced than him, after he left them behind for his current position. This bitterness comes out when he gets the Glengarry leads, and is able to milk the desperation of Sheldon, and the viewer can just feel the venom in their exchanges. Then there's Blake. Blake is an icon to many, both as a movie character, and as a business model. The rapidfire monologues, and searing verbal beatdown of the salesmen is as iconic as anything in cinema. Alec Baldwin is absolute perfection as Blake, playing him as a lecherous, unlikable character that has enough valid points (and intense charisma), to endear himself to the viewer. Finally, there is Jack Lemmon, as Sheldon \"The Machine\" Levene. I didn't expect it, but Lemmon just stole the show. His delivery, characterisation, from the voice, to the expressions, to the posture, everything was pitch-perfect. His desperation to save his job is nothing less than compelling, had me glued to every conversation he had, and certainly had me sympathising a lot more for him than any other character. With actors of this calibre, and a screenplay so brilliant to work off, anyone can see why it is so deserving of adoration.\r\n\r\nNegatives: I actually find myself struggling to think of flaws. Having been based on a play, the film's narrative is a bit different from what you'd expect, and  there is a much more noticeable lack of scenes and locations, with conversations serving for what a separate scene would be used for in more typical fashion. This lack of action can probably be seen as a flaw, as there are probably many who wouldn't take time to admire the brilliant unfolding of the tale. On top of that, if I were to bring up one, tiny (tiny) flaw that I have (and I'm being totally subjective here), it's that we didn't see quite enough of each character in the 100 minute running time. Pacino's Ricky Roma only becomes a major character in the second half, (where he absolutely eats every bit of dialogue he has). If he had more of a presence in the first half, this film would have an even higher standing in my mind than it does  now. Also, Spacey's character, John Williamson, is not quite given enough development, in my eyes. He has a very obvious dislike for those in his office, but I never feel we are quite given enough of a reason for it (save for Roma and Levene throwing insults his way, which could have easily come about, even without a previous bitterness. I feel, if there had been a bit of exposition regarding his relationship with the rest of the cast, it might have made him a stronger character. George and Moss are somewhat the same, as they have smaller roles than Levene, but I still feel that they served there purpose in the film very well, and  have no need to be extended. Of course, this is just me being greedy. This film is still an absolute masterpiece, with superb direction, acting, and writing. If it were up to me, I would have the film go on that little bit longer, just so I could see the electricity of these characters, and these actors, that little bit more.\r\n\r\nIn closing, you don't need to have a keen knowledge of real-estate to get into Glengarry Glen Ross (I know I don't). If you are in any way a fan of good writing, good directing, and above all, phenomenal acting, then you owe it to yourself to see this movie. I f you even consider yourself a fan of cinema, then you won't be making the wrong choice in seeing Glengarry Glen Ross. It serves as a reminder that the world is cruel place, that people will do desperate things when sufficiently motivated, and that life can be as cut throat as any job or business. Again, if you consider yourself a fan of cinema, or you simply like seeing actors give a masterclass in their profession, Glengarry Glen Ross will not disappoint.\r\n\r\nFinal Grade: A",

            "content": "I worked as a knife salesman during the winter break of my freshman year in college. It was one of the most interesting jobs I had ever been involved in. The product was high priced kitchen utilities with knives being the core of the company's prestige but, as this movie tries to convey, the product is not important. I could have been selling anything: the point was to sell and to convince yourself and your potential customer that your doing them a favor. Isn't that what sales is all about?\n\nThe movie was recommended to me by Netflix based on my interest in Scorcese's Taxi Driver and the Godfather trilogy. Netflix got it right, you'll like it if your a fan of the movies just mentioned.\n\nThe movie is based on an a Pulitzer winning play by Dave Mallet who also wrote the screenplay. This is important to note because the dialogue in the movie is epic. The cast spent weeks rehearsing their lines to get the cadence and flow just right and they pull it off magnificently.\n\nJack Lemon pulls off one of his greatest roles (remember Gil Gunderson from the Simpsons? He's a spoof of Lemon's Shelly \"The Machine\" Levene.) There's a scene with him and Al Pacino revolving around  crumb cakes. The dialogue looks mundane when read on paper but come alive with Lemon's execution. Damn incredible...scenes like that make me re-appreciate actors.\n\nAl Pacino got nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his supporting role as Ricky Roma. A monologue where he's in the midst of a sales pitch to a potential investor is beyond memorable. \n\nI hated my salesman job. I hated having to convince someone to do me a favor even though I actually thought the product was cool. The movie made you feel bad for the characters, especially Shelly Levene, who has a sick daughter to look after. Do the questionable tactics that he and his colleagues pull off make them bad people? I don't think so. But all I know is that I hate doing what they're doing. To befriend a stranger with the a goal for profit, even if the opportunity only comes once, is not something I can live with without making mental adjustments. So I guess, the underlining lesson in the movie is that there's no such thing as bad people, only bad salesmen.\n\nJust like Ricky Roma's great monologue.\n\nThe life you lead is worthless if its not yours. Make it yours and go with it. To Jonathan Pryce in the movie, going with it meant an investment and to Ricky Roma: a sale. It's all in the perspective. \n\nI recommend it if you're into dialogue heavy movies or good movies in general.",

Alec Baldwin shines in a short, but effective and critical, role (he has only one wonderful and thoroughly quotable rant/monologue). Al Pacino is as good as always although he has been better (well, that's criticism on a very high level... his fellow 1992 role in Scent of a Woman is my all-time favourite acting job).\nJack Lemmon has incredible screen presence, I found his character annoying though. Ed Harris, Jonathan Pryce and Alan Arkin round out the excellent cast.\n\nThere's also a great script these Hollywood powerhouses could work with.

Naturally, given a cast so drenched with talent, the audience is going to want to see them flaunt their acting chops, and thankfully, that's the key to this entire production. Without a tight band of intense, versatile, believable characters at its core there's no chance a plot that revolves around sales calls and a bland office robbery would be anything more than a snoozer. But in this cast's hands, with this combination of sharp, passionate dialog and sleazy, self-serving lack of morality, it's totally entrancing. Like many play-to-film interpretations, there is a certain amount of stagnation in terms of the film's scenery. The vast majority of the action takes place in a sales office, with phone calls, police interviews and (de)motivational speakers providing the flavor. Those tame surroundings work in a variety of unusual ways, though: as a means to ground the story in reality, an exercise in diverting our attention solely to the acting, and a device to give the rare peeks outside the office's not-so-friendly confines an added dash of color. A master class in cadence and characterization, it's a deep, emphatic and intoxicating look at the gamut of techniques a desperate salesman can (and will) employ.",

David Mamet, who also wrote the play, has produced a fantastic script with fabulous one-liners and witty sarcasm. James Newton Howard's sleazy score matches the tone of this film.

Usually, films that are dialogue-ridden are boring (not including Quentin Tarantino), but Mamet just makes it so interesting. It's interesting to hear these characters talk.  \n\nSecond, the performances. Great acting all-around. It's all real emotional, all so true-to-life. I've never worked in the real-estate field (I'm 16!) but from what I saw, it's not pretty. The cast really captures the desperation of their characters. It's so fascinating to watch them turn on each other when something doesn't go their way.\n\nAnother great thing is that Glengarry Glen Ross just whizzes right on by.

Not an entertaing movie due to the depressing theme but a damn good one.\r\n\r\nJack Lemmon as Shelley Levene is the main focus here and the actor was awarded the National Board of Review best actor award.  Inexplicably, Oscar ignored him but nominated Al Pacino as the fiery Roma in a supporting role.  Pacino is good but it's Lemmon who's the emotional nexus  of the story.  Also, outstanding is Alec Baldwin in a cameo and Kevin Spacey is well cast the office manager. The movie is based on a play so there's lots of talk.  However, the cinematography is excellent and the jazzy score is a reprieve from the \"fuck you\" dialogue.  It's reminiscent of movies like \"Elmer Gantry\"or \"Death of a Salesman\" but it will stand on it's own.  A movie filled with good actors and scorching dialogue.",

The dark atmosphere of that street drenched in rain depicts the characters drenched in their own egos, rage, and self-pity as they desperately hope to sell to their deadbeat customers. It's hard to choose who gives the best performance in this film, because all deserve huge amounts of praise; from Al Pacino's Ricky Roma, the leader on the board that uses his way of words to gain customers trust before getting their signature on the contract, to Jack Lemmon's Shelly \"Machine\" Levine, the oldest salesman in the firm who everyone else thinks has lost his thunder except himself. I like some of these men for obvious reasons, and hate others for obvious reasons, yet they all have one thing in common: the hate they share for their customers. And in suite, I hate the customers as well. And under the direction of Dave Foley, the camera glides with fluid precision during scenes, making me feel more at ease and comfortable with these men as they cheat, lie, and steal their ways into the corporate heart of real estate.

            "content": "\"Always Be Closing.\" -a quote encouraging a group of real-estate salesmen to go out and do their best, no matter what they are given. \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is an explosive drama, centered around the day in the life of four salesman who are faced with bad odds: close or be fired. Each salesman has his own unique personality, but the common thing all 4 have is their way of going about lying to the customer. It's a rather dishonest way to look at this particular field of work, but after a harsh lecture from the company's head (Mitch and Murray) the 4 salesman are given no choice but to use the \"ancient\" leads they are given, or do the unthinkable: rob the office of the new leads, the \"Glengarry\" leads where the potentilal clients are destined to make a close and the salesman is sure to strike it rich. Everyone knows the score, the heat is on, who's got what it takes?\r\n\r\n\"Glengarry Glen Ross\" takes one of the most interesting approaches to life in the work force that I've seen so far, it's reminiscent of \"12 Angry Men\" in the sense that everyone is, well, angry. But the dialogue here is not only far and pedantic  it's exceedingly crude and has a brutal demeanor. Each character doesn't hesitate to share his thoughts and in a movie like this it is not uncommon to have one man screaming his lungs out to another. Every character is tense and the performances showcase it brilliantly. Not one actor in this movie is outclasses by anybody else or not one is even a tad bit monotonous. Al Pacino plays Richard Roma-the cocky young salesman who's a natural at what he does and is on a roll to winning himself a Cadillac El dorado. Jack Lemmon as Shelley Levene, the desperate veteran salesman with a sick daughter and the 'charm' to turn customers on or off--mostly off as we see in a scene as he tries to sell a man real-estate through a phone booth. Lemmon's character was probably my favorite if I had to pick one. He has both the elements of a poor helpless father we feel sorry for, and yet the uselessness of an old retired hermit. Ed Harris is the angry David Moss who has bad work ethic and doesn't know when to stop complaining. Harris' character for me was what really sold the film at first, he has the screen most of the time in the beginning and it's his big mouth that starts so much \"what if\" scenarios that ultimately get carried out by the end of the film. Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin play natural corporate jerks who you know you can relate to in the work force as guys that just seem to be there to make you feel like dirt.\r\n\r\nThe story is catching but not delivered in an easy way. The film moves fast and if you don't pay attention you'll get lost. David Mamet's brilliant dialogue and explosive performances helps keep the tempo of the movie up so that there's never a dull moment when any of these all-star celebrities are onscreen. And it truly is great to see such remarkable actors all onscreen working together. The chemistry certain actors such as Harris and Alan Arkin have together is impeccable. Also Lemmon and Pacino, they play off of each other. \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is probably the best example of the greatest casting choices, where we know all the familiar star-studded faces, but we know they're not all there just to \"look good.\" \r\n\r\nBased on the Pulitzer Prize winning play, I could definitely see how \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" worked onstage, and the transfer over to film is gritty and entertaining. To me the whole concept of vulgarity and angst is not just be \"cool\" by getting away with using such foul language, but to enhance the stress that I know EVERY working man has felt in his office at one time or another. Taking all those emotions literally, it makes for one intense negative trip that ultimately has a positive meaning. \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" is like Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\" without the violence. With all the actors playing off of each other and the next move completely unpredictable it's a great movie to watch to remember that what we go through on a regular basis at work can be documented and depicted in an interesting, almost exaggerative way. But remember the policy Baldwin's character Blake heeds, \"A, B, C...Always Be Closing...\"",

It's become a little dated, but it's still worth watching. I know just about every line of dialog. Maybe I shouldn't admit that. Jack Lemmon's Shelley Levine is a tragic character for the ages played with every ounce of dramatic tension Lemmon could muster; it was one of his last great roles. Pacino's Ricky Roma is hilarious and often over-the-top Pacino-style. I love his scenes with Ed Harris, who as Moss is the sinister heart of the plot, and Pacino's silent moments are great like when he's listening to Levine tell his sale. Kevin Spacey is a perfect Williamson, absorber of much abuse. Pacino shreds him repeatedly. Alec Baldwin's scene early in the film is the thing most people remember. It's darkly hilarious. And I can't forget Alan Arkin, the innocuous guy caught in between. The way Moss reels him in is fascinating. Anyways, if you're not into Mamet you probably won't like it and may even be bored, but as for me it's one of my favorite flicks. \"What's this toilet paper you're handing me?\"",

            "content": "A distinctly cynical but witty drama, that pokes fun at the world of professional sales, and features one of the best ensemble casts of the nineties.\r\n\r\nJames Foley takes a step up from directing Madonna videos to craft this entertaining drama that will speak to anyone who's ever had to work a job they've hated. Set in the office of a Chicago-based real estate agent, the film follows its floundering employees who are given an ultimatum of closing a deal or losing their job. It's a testosterone fuelled marketplace which sees some employees charm their way to success and others plummet to new lows in order to avoid the chopping block. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the cast, things really couldn't get better. Jack Lemmon leads the team with a sympathetic turn as down-on-his-luck Shelley Levene. Once the biggest man in the office, recent years have seen him fall to the bottom of the heap, overtaken by younger and more ruthless salesmen. His performance is one of the film's best, as Lemmon really captures the audience's sympathy with his desperate portrayal. Alongside him Alan Arkin and Ed Harris play less likeable but equally troubled salesmen, and both bring their A-game to the roles. Similarly Kevin Spacey stars as their inept office manager, while Alec Baldwin puts in a great supporting performance despite only appearing in one scene throughout the whole movie. His monologue here is one of the most memorable I think I've ever witnessed. British actor Jonathan Pryce also stars as an unsuspecting buyer, targeted by a slick salespitch made by Ricky Roma; the office's top dog. \r\n\r\nPlayed brilliantly by Al Pacino, the Roma character is a foul-mouthed hothead who knows how to make a sale. Pacino brings a huge amount of life to the role, standing out from the entire cast and showing once again just what a commanding screen presence he is. In 1993 Pacino received Oscar nominations for his work both here and in Scent of a Woman. Of course the Academy went for his baity role in the latter, but in terms of the better performance, I found his work here to be less contrived and simply more entertaining. This is a performance any who consider themselves a Pacino fan should see.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the film is quite dialogue heavy, and that may put some viewers off. However personally I feel the well-written albeit wordy screenplay acts as one of the film's strengths, filled with witty exchanges and providing great material for the talented cast to play with. That being said certain scenes have a tendency to drag, and though the film is generally well paced and by no means overstays its welcome at just 96 minutes, there are still one or two occasions where Foley could have tightened things up.\r\n\r\nOn the whole however, this is a very worthy drama featuring a host of fine performances, making it easily one of my favourite films of its year.",

They all get their moments to shine and they all hit the nail on the head, Alec balwin is the first one to flex his acting muscles in his now classic speech ,he has never been better (apart from 30 rock), he's in the flim less 10mins but you listen to ever word he has to say, and that sets the Bech Mark from then on all the other actors  try to out do each other. Al pacino gets to do what he does best shouts nobody shouts better then him. But for me the one you fell the most for is jack lemmon putting on a acting masterclass ,  he brings so much to the character you real sympathise for him though out the flim.\n\nAll in all. If you in the mood for power house performance and a good story sit down with a cup of tea and enjoy",

            "content": "This is a great movie in particular respects. I think it should be required viewing for business-school freshmen. Its two great strengths are its writing and its acting. The screenplay by David Mamet is excellent, full of long angry monologues and venomous back and forth dialogue. The movie has little plot, but it's fascinating just to listen to the characters talk and insult each other. The movie has an unbelievably good cast, with some of the very best actors in the business at the time: Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, and Alec Baldwin, and they all actually get adequate screen time and development. Only Pacino got an Oscar nomination when the movie was released, but I really think Lemmon and possibly Baldwin should have gotten nominations as well. It's particularly astonishing to see Lemmon throwing around curse words like it's nothing if you're acquainted with his nice-guy image from his 1950s and 1960s movies, but he does it just so well here; plus, his character goes through the most interesting transformations over the movie. Baldwin only has one scene at the beginning of the film, but it's an excellent scene; he's essentially playing the serious version of the funny character he now plays on 30 Rock, but he was just as convincing here as he is now on the show. Pacino gets some great showy monologue moments, the kind he's always been best with. Harris and Arkin have slightly smaller roles, but their conversations are really good while they last. This might be one of the best all-male ensemble casts I've ever seen. The movie's direction, by James Foley, is quite good, showing some visual flair without overdoing it. The only real flaw in the movie is the godawful soundtrack, which is cheesy jazz that does not fit the tone of the movie at all, sometimes is so loud as to nearly drown out the excellent dialogue, and seems to float in and out of the movie randomly. If ever there was a movie that had no need for a soundtrack, it was this one, and yet it got an absolutely terrible and obnoxious one. Other than the soundtrack, though, it's hard for me to find fault with this compelling multi-character-study.",

Mamet's words are so intricate and beautiful, filthy and philandering, and yet they sparkle with their brilliance. Most of the film contains these long, convoluted rants from different characters that contain subtle context about their livelihood. Their dialogue is full of the candor and realism of being a salesman in the cutthroat business of selling real estate. Mamet creates characters that are full of expectation, remorse, screaming at one another and anyone to let themselves finally become heard. These words come out of the mouths of a cast that is more impressively assembled than any ever before, including Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, and Kevin Spacey. Each performance has its own breadth, no matter how unknown some of the actors were at the time (Kevin Spacey, I'm looking at you) and always feels desperate. Whether you're the iron willed pro who is closing in on the deal of the century or the warbling old man on his last leg against the crushing pain of unemployment and ruin, they each are wailing for someone to listen to their plight. Though these performances are amazing, it's Jack Lemmon who steals the show on more than one occasion as the chatterbox Shelley Levene. His rants are usually the longest, spiteful, most epithet filled pieces of Americana you have ever heard. He speaks on the state of salesman, his own problems, and time and again begs for understanding from his manager. Al Pacino is also impressive as the only closing salesman, pulling punches and scams in order to get to the yes. Everyone is always lying to their customers, but Pacino is suave and charismatic to boot. The film is set in 24 hours and doesn't move around many sets, but it encases many lives and the consequences of irrational behavior. A classic of American theater as well as film, this is one film that must be seen in your lifetime.",

This film, that is over an hour and a half, runs like a 45 minute episode of a drama. It picks up the pace from the beginning and burns strong the entire time until the satisfying conclusion. The production values are modest, there is not a whole lot going on, but the actors immediately immerse you in their slimy, underground world. Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino really steal the show by the end of the film. The film is really worth watching, if for nothing else, for the excellent, short performance turned in by Alec Baldwin within the first 20 minutes of the movie. This is an acting and screen writing clinic and it is not to be missed.",

This film is like a dream cast of high-profile actors.\nThis film is so good that it became the definitive version of the Glengarry over the years.\nThat said, the first half of the show interests me less than the second half, as it takes a while to really get going.\nOr maybe its just because I have far more experience with the second act of the play.",

Much of the action is omitted, in favour of dialogue and re-telling of events. This dialogue however is sharp, snappy and witty, and the script as a whole is spot on. The all-star cast work well together, with each of the salesman making their marks on the film. Set almost interily in one or two rooms, and with a fairly basic plot, the film can be summarised as simple yet effective. Everything that is said has meaning, and every action, though few have consequences. Jack Lemmon in particular is enticing as an almost down-and-out salesman, and the twist involving his character at the end is unexpected. Overall very enjoyable, just dont expect much to happen.",

The dialogue is fast, harsh and incredibly powerful and is arguably the strong point of the movie. Although, despite the plot seeming as if it wouldn't work dramatically with characters trying to make closures on estate sales, the motives of the characters and their stories (especially Lemmon's character's) of how they do their job is great to watch. Tension rises as the robbery is made, and the relationships between the men in the office shifts brilliantly as trust becomes an issue amongst them",
