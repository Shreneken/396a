When his teenage cousin Bill and his friend Stan are accused of murder in a backwater Alabama town, it's up to the nervous Vinny to save him from jail, even though he's only ever tried personal injury cases before, and none of them successfully.",

Tomei is awesome with Pesci not far behind. The bickering between the two was extremely funny from the first time they appeared right through the start of credits rolling. Great movie revolving almost entirely around the two leads. I'm sorry I waited so long to watch it a second time. If you like (mostly) clean comedy, this movie is worth watching.",

This IS Joe Pesci's movie, and Pesci as the lawyer Vinny is quite good, getting better at this law business as he goes along. The whole thing is overshadowed of course by Marisa Tomei as his dim-as-a-bulb girlfriend, who has a few trick up her sleeve. Tomei won the Oscar for this, I will say it's unjustified. It really is a nothing part without any oomph in it.",

            "content": "My Cousin Vinny, directed by Jonathan Lynn, produced by Dale Launer & Paul Schiff, was respectfully one of the most accurate law movies that's been put out, to date. With My Cousin Vinny being a court room movie, somehow Jonathan Lynn incorporated this great comedic twist, to this nobale premise, that blended just right with Joe Pecsi's lead. With a script that can be predictable at times, Pesci brought his seasoned charisma to really drive this movie. Dale Launer put together such a hilarious, yet super witty script, holding a lot of weight, keeping everyone thoroughly entertained the whole time.\n\nDavid Rubin went all out, casting this brilliant cast, that blended so well together! Recently, coming off of JFK, and being known for Home Alone & Lethal Weapon, Joe Pesci shined bright in this film! He was so friggen hilarious, while having this sarcastic wit, that seems to get him through a lot, yet get him into a lot. He put on such an entertaining performance, having this off tone personality, developing into a somewhat civilized professional. Marisa Toemi also put on such a great performance as the main supportive character. This was definitively her best performance of her whole career, winning her first and only Academy Award for her performance. Her character often got shadowed on purpose, foreshadowing her wit, making her character that much more enjoyable come the third act. Ralph Macchio was the driving reason for the film. Right off the bat, Jonathan Lynn made it real easy to get behind, and root for Macchio, by letting us in on the truth. Fred Gwynne as Judge Chamberlain Haller, was a great plot device. His character was so blunt, and right to the point, where him and Joe Peaci had more than a handful of enjoyable scenes.\n\nThe costume designer in Carol Wood did such a fantastic job. For a movie that talks about the costumes for a decent portion of the film, Carol Wood made sure to put her creativity on display, and it paid off tremendously.\n\nVictoria Paul created these unique sets. She incorporated great set pieces, creating this authentic looking court room, also creating this great representation of good ol', muddy Alabama.\n\nI've been enjoying My Cousin Vinny for as long as I can remember; watching it so many times, I've only picked up on a few defects. The only complaints I have, there are a few convenient scenes, and that it takes some liberties with the law also making things extra theatrical. Overall, I know I can always go to this movie on for a good laugh. If anyone ever asks for a Joe Pesci movie, besides his gang affiliated movies, this would be my go to!",

During The Struggle, Along Comes Harry From \"Home Alone\" (1990) & \"Home Alone 2: Lost In New York\" (1992), Joe Pesci As Bill's Cousin Vinny To Build His Way Up To Be A Better Lawyer In The Judge's Taste As He Solves Parts Of The Mystery With The Help Of His Sassy But EXTREMELY SEXY Wife *whistle whistle* Mona Lisa Vito, Played By Marisa Tomei.\n\nNow, About The Film: The Comedic Duo Of Pesci & Tomei Is Enjoyable To Watch.

Overall, \"My Cousin Vinny\" Is A Good Movie; For It Has 2 Great & Funny Actors, & A Handful Of Laughs Here & There, But Predictable Writing, It's The Execution Of The Film's Deft Interplay Between The Husband & Wife That Makes The Movie.

It takes great care with its clever script in order to maintain an accurate portrayal of a courtroom's procedure, while spoofing the entire ordeal. It is filled with fun outfits, music, and performances. Lynn's My Cousin Vinny is a rightful courtroom classic and a must see for fans of comedies and courtroom dramas. It brought me constant laughter and plenty to think about in regards to courtroom etiquette.\n\nFirst of all, Joe Pesci is awesome. His idiotic, but well meaning lawyer from New York is just so much fun to watch. Pesci plays a new lawyer learning as he goes, a devoted fiancee that ignores his endearing, helpful lady, all while trying to help out his cousin and aspire to be a real lawyer. Pesci is really great at screaming loudly and delivering monologues and he does both in My Cousin Vinny. I love that Pesci can capture a genuine man dreaming of the law that can help someone, while not knowing anything about conducting himself in a courtroom. He gives a great anecdote about the judge that inspired him to be a lawyer as well as delivering classic comedy moments in Alabama and sweet interactions with Marisa Tomei.\n\nSpeaking of Tomei, My Cousin Vinny got her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress! This was well deserved as her New Jersey accent, glaring attitude, earnest helpfulness, and mechanical knowledge are all impressive. Tomei is electrifying every time she is on screen. She acts toe to toe with Joe Pesci in his prime. Marisa Tomei gave the performance of a lifetime in My Cousin Vinny.\n\nThe rest of the supporting cast are no slouches as My Cousin Vinny features a wide array of character actors. Ralph Macchio is endearing and likable as a wrongly accused man alongside Mitchell Whitfield. Fred Gwynne's strictly by the book of procedure judge is a hilarious tough foil for Pesci's easy going lawyer. Lane Smith's prosecutor is rigid, yet friendly enough that you only hate him for being crooked. Bruce McGill's sheriff is amiable and fun. Lastly, Austin Pendleton gives a gut busting performance at the nervous and inept state appointed public defender. You will not forget any of these wonderful characters thanks to the admirable acting from these character actors.\n\nI loved My Cousin Vinny. Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei just capture your attention and hold it to the end. It's hard to believe this movie was almost 2 full hours as it only feels like 1, if that. I think most audiences will be entertained by My Cousin Vinny.",

It is not flat out hilarious. Maybe, because it doesn't try too hard. It is happy in its convenience. And it's that flow that makers doesn't wish to stop and neither do we. Satisfied within its range, this soothing feature endorses your textbook comic sequence with a bit of drama imputed in it that helps it make it more grounded and practical. And giving the script a hand, is the performance that makes it more pragmatic and believable. This hilarious casting is apt for this sort of storyline.\n\nPesci on the driver's seat has been allotted basically his home ground. This is his forte. Whether then be it to argue without any knowledge or do physical comedy, his range never fails to surprise you. His comic timing is off the roof. But this isn't a one man army war. The story demands a better guide to this protagonist and Tomei is just the actor to portray this character. Her accent, her whining over little things and a vital \"witness\" to this case, she is a competition to Pesci. Their bittersweet relationship is the trump card of the feature.\n\nThe narration though, is mediocre throughout the course. It's that flat line that is off putting. Even the courtroom drama offers you the expected chills and nothing extraordinary. Lynn manages to keep a big smile on your face thoroughly with Launer's simple and sensible script and his decent execution. There are no surprising elements, nothing to be mesmerized about. My Cousin Vinny is just like your cousin, you wouldn't leave your ears off when it has to say something, but you wouldn't miss it too, after the curtain drops.",

            "content": "\"Ridiculous! All this over a can of tuna!\"\n\nThis movie is HILARIOUS! I haven't laughed this hard in a while.\nIn the surface, My Cousin Vinny seems to be a small easy-going comedy movie with a fish-out-of-water/mistaken identity story, and that's exactly how should you see it to enjoy it, but that doesn't mean it's just that kind of a movie. This movie doesn't just have some smart jokes, and funny characters, but it's a clever, and kinda profound movie at its core. The way the sub-plots are connected to the character arc of Vinny, and how they reflect his development, and express his feelings, reminded me of the Coen Bros. quite a bit, but, of course, in a much lighter way. The funny misfortunes of Vinny are purely Coen-esque! And of course that means that the movie has a moral, and it's really an impressive, and sorta useful, one. It's a message about changing for better; a message about the indifference and how it's unprofitable, and even harmful.\n\nAs I mentioned that it's better to watch the movie as a comedy and nothing else, I did that and I think My Cousin Vinny almost excels on so many levels as a comedy. From the clever jokes, to the comical slap-stick direction style, to the both oddball and reasonable characters, I found myself enjoying every moment in the movie, and laugh constantly throughout its runtime.\n\nJoe Pesci and Marisa Tomei's chemistry is just unparalleled! Needless to say that they delivered some of their best performances in their rich career bringing their already well-composed and well-designed characters to life. Especially Mona Lisa Vito, played by Marisa Tomei that I found she really has some depth that can rarely be found in comedy movies. She's a round character; stubborn, kinda sassy, yet smart and sensitive... and she's cute, too!\nMitchell Whitfield and Ralph Macchio, who played the two young New Yorkers, are also very good; they have a good chemistry as well, and their reactions to the misunderstanding at the beginning are hysterically funny.\n\nThe third act that take place in the courtroom is more serious, but that definitely doesn't mean it doesn't contain jokes or lack of humor. In addition to that, it has prepared for it very well. What surprised me is that I found the third act could be the most intriguing part of the movie. Due to the smartness of the script, the dialogue is pretty sharp, the denouement is surprisingly convincing, and the jokes this time is more clever because they rely on the writing and the acting, not the direction. I mean in a large part, obviously.\n\nThe dramatic moments at the let-downs, however, seem very forced, and didn't work for me at all. They really could have been balanced with the comical tone of the movie way better than that.

            "content": "My Cousin Vinny is an amalgamation of two things that I love. It has a hilarious fish-out-of-water story where these New Yorkers attempt to understand the inner workings of a small southern town. At the same time it has courtroom drama, with a ton of clever questioning and smart work by the lawyers. This movie never ceases to make me laugh and feel unending joy every time I watch it. Every cast member is superb and I love how they play all the comedy straight while I\u2019m laughing like an idiot. I still remember how people were up in arms about Marisa Tomei winning a Supporting Actress Oscar that year, but she is so divine in this film that I cannot imagine anyone deserving it more. This is one of those movies that I can\u2019t turn off if I happen to find it on TV, and I will watch until the end even if I just saw part of it the day before. There\u2019s something so satisfying about the film, that it still works for me no matter how many times I see it. I recently watched it from start to finish for the first time in a long time, and I was struck by how well it still holds up to this day. I did my best to watch with a critical eye and search for nitpicks and flaws that others might have, and all I could find were a couple of scenes that felt edited slightly out of order, that might have flowed better if shuffled around. However it is very minor, and does nothing to hurt the story, so I didn\u2019t care. My Cousin Vinny still holds as one of my all-time favorite films, and a movie I\u2019ll be delighted to watch any time I have the opportunity.",

She is a funny character and Tomei gives life to the Yankee character)\n\nThat's all i'm going to say,  ''My Cousin Vinny'' (1992) is an hilarous movie, brimming with energy from start to finish, the plot (however conventional) is excellent.

Comedies like these - with a strong, but simple story, strong characters and great actors. These aren't around anymore, at least not in this format, and only get a limited theatrical release before going straight to video-on-demand, while the theaters are reserved for blockbusters. \n\nJoe Pesci obviously dominates here as a would-be Brooklyn Italian attorney who comes out to hicksville Alabama to defend his cousin and his best friend, two New York teenagers who get framed for murdering a convenient store clerk while driving across the country and checking out colleges. The story is simple, basic, but the cast makes it incredibly enjoyable. \n\nMarissa Tomei actually won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as Vinny's girlfriend, Mona Lisa Vito, and deserving so, but I couldn't help but think that today, a performance like hers would go unnoticed, simply because it was in a comedy, and comedies are unappreciated. Side note: she looks so good in this movie that you'll most likely have to pause it a couple of times. \n\nMy Cousin Vinny is probably Ralph Macchio's last hit, even though the Karate Kid is a supporting actor here, after this one, he didn't make much, plus, this is probably the last movie where he played a teenager, which was a stretch, as he was about 31 at the time.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you should watch every couple of years, simply because it offers a decent amount of laughs and gives you comedic characters that you just enjoy spending time with. Plus, this is Joe Pesci at his best, and like George Carlin said: 'I pray to Joe Pesci because he gets shit done', and My Cousin Vinny is no exception.",

In their desperation, they hire the cousin of one of them to be their lawyer, only to find out that Vinny has only recently become a lawyer, and has no real experience with legal procedure.\n\nAccording to my research, this film is actually fairly accurate and realistic in terms of how it portrays legal procedures, trials, and that sort of thing. So, going by that, I can get behind this film for trying to do some *ahem* justice to its subject matter.\n\nThe film does occasionally dip into outdated and on the nose territory with some of the fish out of water elements, but overall, this is a pretty witty, sharp, and funny comedy.\n\nRalph Macchio is fine as Bill, but Mitchell Whitfield is only okay as his buddy Stan. As Bill's cousin Vinny, Joe Pesci is a delight. Lane Smith is fun as the prosecutor, Bruce McGill is fun as the sheriff, and Fred Gwynne (in his final film) is quite strong as the judge. The real scene stealer here though, is Marisa Tomei in her breakout Oscar winning performance as Vinny's loudmouth fiancee who is along for the ride. And then of course there's yet another turn by James Rebhorn in an antagonistic role. He's fine of course, but sometimes I wish I could see him go against type. \n\nThe film is a bit dated and out of touch, and, like I said, goes for easy and obvious targets with its humor. All in all though, this is a a really funny and delightful film, so give it a watch if you haven't done so yet.",

            "content": "An agreeable if minor fish-out-of-water comedy that is perfect for television viewing. Joe Pesci is a novice lawyer from New York hired by his cousin (Ralph Macchio) and a friend (Mitchell Whitfield) to defend them during a murder trial in a small Alabama town. This broad comedy gets laughs from the flamboyant New Yorkers appearing conspicuous amidst the reserved southerners. All of the characters are presented with equal affection as caricatures so there is no lapse into condescension. Pesci is inspired here and has never been more likable. Marisa Tomei is devastatingly funny as Pesci's highly agitated fianc\u00e9e. In his final role, Fred Gwynne is marvelous in one of his most memorable performances as the querulous judge. There are no surprises in the script and it features customary pacing. But it's a modern comedy that endures. Tomei won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. Written by Dale Launer. Directed by Jonathan Lynn. With Lane Smith, Bruce McGill, Austin Pendleton.",

But when they realize how unexperienced Vinny is in court, their situation seems hopeless. \"My Cousin Vinny\" is a fun-filled fish out of water story with exceptional performances from both Pesci and Tomei, seeing Vinny trying to navigate through the Alabama legal system is quite hilarious and the film is one great courtroom comedy.",
