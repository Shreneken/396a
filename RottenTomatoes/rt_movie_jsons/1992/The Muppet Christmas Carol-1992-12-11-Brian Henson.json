    "summary": "The Muppets perform the classic Dickens holiday tale, with Kermit the Frog playing Bob Cratchit, the put-upon clerk of stingy Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine). Other Muppets -- Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie Bear and Sam the Eagle -- weave in and out of the story, while Scrooge receives visits from spirits of three Christmases -- past, present and future. They show him the error of his self-serving ways, but the miserable old man seems to be past any hope of redemption and happiness.",

It's got a bisque doll face, creeps me out. \n\nMichael Caine as Scrooge is an all-time casting choice, and his performance (played straight alongside a bunch of irreverent felt puppets) fits the rest of the film, which is among the best of what the Muppets franchise has to offer, and a fitting tribute to the then recently-passed Jim Henson. The heartless will complain about the film's sweetness and kind nature, but the adaptation hardly loses any of the remorse and chill of the original Dickens tale while keeping the delightful nature of the Muppets franchise. Even 'serious' adaptations fail to replicate the sincerity and richness of this 1992 holiday classic, which manages to bring not only excellent visual design, but is not commonly cited for its effective pacing despite only running for 85 minutes. \n\nWho is the best Muppet? Personally, I never get tired of seeing Fozzie Bear. Wocka wocka! (4/5)",

Caine delivers a master-class performance that contrasts well with the humor-driven muppets. They never fail to pull out an unexpected emotional moment when needed, though. Every muppet fits in well with the role they have in the movie and it feels like a nice marriage between a beloved old story and the wacky antics of the muppets. The biggest surprise is the film being able to bring in Charles Dickens to narrate, despite his odd new attraction to chickens and strangely curved nose.",

I especially liked The Ghost of Christmas Present.  Gonzo and Rizzo are very good as the movie's narrators.  They also had some good jokes.  The songs in the movie are good.  There is no \"Rainbow Connection\" in the movie per se, but the songs fit the movie well and the musical numbers are well staged.

That may disappoint you if you go watch it thinking it would go all out on a certain aspect of the idea of \"The Muppets Christmas Carol\".

This is a retelling of Charles Dickens's 1843 novella A Christmas Carol as only the Muppets could do. Michael Caine played Scrooge in this version and while he might not be the best Scrooge ever captured on screen, he does a good job here. I do question his musical ability and casting him in a musical. Kermit does feel different with Brian Henson as his performer, but I think Jim Henson's son does capture the character well. Gonzo and Rizzo are the narrators for this version and their comedic antics throughout the film worked well for me. I also think that the Muppets on the whole do add to the story and provide a unique comedic take on the classic tale. The music for this film is fine. \"One More Sleep \u2018til Christmas\" is a new classic Christmas song in my humble opinion. The Muppet movies that follow this one also tell a classic story through a Muppet lens. This one is the best of those. I think this is a must watch and I bring it out every Christmas to see it again.",

This movie is the best adaptation of Dicken's classic tale, with enough fun and heart to watch with the family again and again (and again). Michael Caine really brings his A game in this one and does an amazing job bringing the world to life. It really looked like he lived in a world of Muppets! The CGI is amazing, like they had Caine walk on raised platforms above the Muppeteers just like Ian McKellan did in Lord of the Rings! The score and songs are great too, even the sad one that was inexplicably cut and added back as an extra - be sure to watch it because it's meant to be there and makes the reprise at the end all the more special. I was visited by 3 spirits the night after I watched this and the ghost of Christmas future showed me the bleak shadows of what may be if RT never makes me a super reviewer. The lesson here is to live in the past, the present and the future, and we're living it with the 531 movie journey. Quit being such a Scrooge, RT. It's Christmas time after all!",

I don't think this is one of the greatest adaptations of the Charles Dickens tale but I understand why most people have fond memories of it. It is still an endearing Christmas movie with good songs and decent puppeteering which rises on the strength of Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge since he treats the Muppets as though they were normal people like you and me rather than just mere puppets. Since I didn't grow up with Kermit the Frog and his pals, I can't say I love this version of the timeless story but it is still a decent introduction for children to one of the most iconic pieces of literature.",

It was fun to remember the various muppets from The Muppet Show (those from Sesame Street are absent here), playing bit parts.  The major roles are taken by Michael Caine (Scrooge) and Kermit (Bob Cratchit).  Paul Williams wrote the songs -which are pretty bland and not up to the level of 1970's Scrooge (with Albert Finney).  In places the story seems abbreviated, particularly when showing Scrooge as a youth in love, but this was probably for the best as attentions of the under 9 crowd were wavering at that point.  There is a lot of comic relief, mostly from Rizzo the Rat and Gonzo (as narrators) but the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come might be scary for some.  Caine does fine but nothing spectacular. This is the first project for the muppets after Jim Henson's death and it is dedicated to him.",

On the next holiday season, he receives some special visitors who try to show and convince that the true meaning of Christmas is one worth celebrating.\n\nI think the Muppets are very entertaining and can be very funny; I enjoy their comedy shows and I appreciate how diverse the cast is, which helps remember most of them. Their feature length films, though, I feel can be either fairly entertaining and funny (such as \"Muppets from Space\" or \"Muppet Treasure Island\") or annoying and weird (like \"The Great Muppet Caper\").\n\nFor this film, I thought the humor was well balanced to be enjoyable for kids while also appealing to adults who might have grown with these characters. Most of the Muppets have their own moments to showcase their talents but they are not annoying. The musical sequences are good. I don't know if I would say amazing, but they work for this Muppet movie.\n\nThe human cast also does a fine job. Michael Caine has the characteristics of what you might imagine Ebenezer Scrooge to be like: grouchy, a snob, but also a sad man at his core. I don't know most of the other cast members, nor would I probably recognize them by name, but they did well in their parts by showing their Christmas spirits.\n\nBeing an adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel \"A Christmas Carol\", the movie develops its plot well enough to stand on its own while respecting the original story, for the most part. If anything, the last scene of Christmas Past feels a little bit too rushed to get the full feel of Scrooge's motivation of his dislike for Christmas. I thought his character changes in the movie were well done with the songs because they have at least some time to be good. The theatrical edition of \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" was going to have a song also showing Ebenezer's Christmas past, but apparently it was taken out of the final film because the filmmakers thought it was too hard to understand for kids. Thank goodness for the special edition where we actually listen to that song. Such a shame it was taken out.\n\n\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a mostly beat for beat retelling of the Dickens classic, while having a blend of its Muppet style to go along with it. And honestly, it doesn't need to do anything complex for its story; it should just have good songs, storytelling, and performances to be good. And it is really good.\n8/10",

While the Muppets' fourth feature film is brimming with wit, sharp humor and memorable musical numbers, a palpable sense of sadness hangs heavy over the production. It permeates every scene, every reflection on death and regret, every puppeteer's work, even the way Kermit's head droops or his smile fades seems to whisper \"we are not what we once were.\" And yet Jim Henson's legacy is alive and well in\u00c2\u00a0The Muppet Christmas Carol. Brian Henson, his puppeteers and the Muppets themselves refuse to let a day pass wasted, even in their grief, and allow their sadness to not only invade the production but to inhabit it, enrich it and make it a more sincere, emotionally poignant film. Watching Kermit and Robin as Cratchet and Tiny Tim -- a loving father who devotes every ounce of his strength to his work and his son -- is suddenly utterly heartbreaking and incredibly moving. Seeing Scrooge learn what Jim Henson spent his days teaching -- to live life to its fullest, bringing joy to others whenever possible -- suddenly resonates unlike any \"Christmas Carol\" adaptation before or since. Realizing Brian Henson is coming into his own, in complete, confident command of his craft -- on his feature film directorial debut no less -- is suddenly wonderfully satisfying. \"We are not what we once were\" suddenly translates to something else entirely: \"This too shall pass. We are exactly what Jim wanted us to be.\"",

            "content": "If I had to rank all the Muppet movies, I'm only missing the most recent film, Most Wanted, from worst-to-best it'd be in this order:  Muppets From Space, Muppet Treasure Island, this movie, The Great Muppet Caper, Muppets Take Manhattan, The Muppet Movie, and the excellent 2011 reboot.  So you can see that this is a middle of the road, in terms of quality, for the Muppets.  With that said, it's still a pretty good movie.  The problem is that, while A Christmas Carol is STILL an excellent story of a man's redemption, I don't think the Muppets really work well when trying to fit into the framework of a story that's been told thousands and thousands of times.  There's still the musical numbers, there's still the clever humor that breaks the fourth wall, Miss Piggy is still great...there's just less of it this time around, because they're working within the confines of this book. Not that I can blame them for that, but it's still a little disappointing that there wasn't as much Muppet greatness as there is in other, original, films.  With that said, if there's one thing I liked about this movie more than any adaptation of A Christmas Carol I've ever seen, and that is Michael Caine's performance.  I think he's, head and shoulders, the best Ebenezer Scrooge there has been.  I think his performance isn't as notable because he IS surrounded by Muppets and all this absurd humor, but that doesn't make it any less effective or heartfelt.  This guy is incredible here.  It's not anything Oscar worthy, but it is an excellent performance that makes this film worth it even with its flaws.  It's probably not even the best adaptation of this story that has ever been made.  I even thought about it raising the rating to 3.5, but I genuinely think this film is just good.  I just think the lack of real Muppet insanity held this movie back for me.  But that's just me.  But this is a good movie nonetheless, this story will always bee a good one and with Caine's excellent performance, then this is at least worth a watch.",

Micheal Caine does a great job playing a Muppet movie as a human role should be.  Play it straight, play it real, be in the film the same way you would be with other actors not just Muppets.

            "content": "Let's not beat around the bush. I adore The Muppet Christmas Carol. Since my parents bought it for me on VHS back in 1993, it is the only Christmas film that I make a point of watching at least once every year. Taking one of the greatest stories ever written from one of the greatest writers of all time and making at least a half-decent film out of it shouldn't be too hard a task. Yet, there are films out there which have completely failed to make anything decent out of Dickens' story and some have even managed to somehow make it boring.\n\nThe biggest problem anyone faces with adapting A Christmas Carol is making it stand out from the other versions of it. To say there's an overabundance of adaptations is a radical understatement. On that basis, you'd think that one of the key ways to help your version stand out is by adopting a gimmick. There's so many failed examples of this though. The last high-profile adaptation was Robert Zemeckis' take on the story with Jim Carrey as Scrooge. The gimmick? Motion capture animation and 3D. Exactly what the story didn't need. Elsewhere, you've got modernizations, a potentially decent idea, but I can't name one that worked. I know some will stand up for Scrooged, but, for me, it was OK at best. Then there's A Christmas Carol 2000, in which ITV decided that a modernization with Ross Kemp playing Scrooge was a good idea.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nSo, why does The Muppet Christmas Carol work? The main reason is it's refusal to resort to any level of pretentiousness, a real sticking point for some of the worst versions of the story. Here, there is no belief present that they can add anything to the story or make it better, because they know that they can't. Instead, they take the story and everything that's great about it. Then, most crucially of all, they make sure that The Muppets themselves are made to fit around the story, rather than the other way round. I'm not providing a synopsis. If you don't know the plot, where have you been? In addition, I'm also not going to worry too much about avoiding spoilers from this point on.\n\nIn this adaptation, Michael Caine plays Scrooge and, frankly, it's inspired casting. Scrooge is a character that demands an actor with credibility, but the presence of The Muppets would mean that a lot of actors out there would not have taken this role seriously and would have completely phoned in the performance. Caine's not doing that here. He's crafting what I honestly believe to be one of his best performances. The usual style of performance for Caine wouldn't have worked here and it's refreshing to see little to none of his usual mannerisms present here. He delivers a fantastic interpretation and one that feels human, rather than the overly animated cartoonish performances (hello again, Jim Carrey) that we often find ourselves subjected to. That's not to say he's relatable. He's every bit as reprehensible as he should be, but because he seems like a real person, it means that his development over the course of the film feels legitimate and, in no way, forced. As for his singing and dancing, you'll just have to learn to forgive him for that and realize that it could be worse, you could be watching him in Jaws IV.\n\nThe presence of Caine also helps in another matter, as he makes sure the story is respected, allowing a balance to form between that and the antics of The Muppets, who fill most of the other roles. Kermit takes the biggest role of Bob Cratchitt and is really the only instance of a Muppet playing it straight, with the exception of a Kermit Jr. playing Tiny Tim. Elsewhere, the Muppets are pretty much kept to the comedy characters, as they should be. Rizzo's playing the sidekick to Gonzo's narrative performance as Charles Dickens and while Fozziwig may seem an obvious joke, it's a necessary one.\n\nTo be honest, the only place where the presence of a Muppet is fumbled is in Miss Piggy playing Emily Cratchit, or rather Miss Piggy playing Miss Piggy, but going by the name of Emily Cratchit. The jokes work fine for her. Piggy's not exactly my favourite Muppet, but the traditional and necessary elements of her character worked here. The problem is when they expect us to take her seriously as the grieving mother. It just doesn't work and renders what should be one of the most poignant moments of the story feeling a little bit hokey. To be honest though, it probably won't bother you too much and, as my score will demonstrate, it's not something that gets held against the film. In the long run, it's a minor gripe.\n\nThen, we have the Muppet-style comedy transitioning into the Dickensian world and there's only one word to describe how they've handled this. Masterful. First off, it;s actually funny. A requirement that shouldn't need stating about comedy, but I watched Disaster Movie last week and learnt that, apparently, it does. There's also the flawless way that each joke fits into the story without feeling like it's intruding. Each joke is fast and to the point and, crucially, they don't dwell on them. The joke happens, you laugh and they head straight back to the story, meaning that the focus is never lost. They also don't feel the need to saturate every scene with them. The 15 (or so) minutes assigned to The Ghost Of Christmas Yet To Come is pretty much devoid of jokes, relying almost entirely on the words of Dickens to bring out any humour, but, for the most part, keeping the necessarily morbid tone that the scenes require. As a result, that element of the story feels particularly powerful, as we're left to focus on Scrooge's despaired realization of where his actions will take him. If the earlier jokes weren't funny, this wouldn't have felt anywhere near as strong as it did and it also wouldn't provide the relief and joy of the final moments as we return to the jovial nature that dominates the rest of the film.\n\nFinally, there are the songs. I'll say it now. Musicals are not my thing. I would much rather someone just tell me how they feel, rather than sing it to me. Yet, despite that, I love a lot of the songs from the film. I'm sure it helps that I first heard them when I was 6 and far less discerning than I am now, but regardless they are well written songs and my only issue comes from the deletion of one of them. Again, this is not something I will hold against the film as it is entirely down to studio interference, rather than creative choice. The song that's deleted is called When Love Is Gone. It's not the best song and it's almost overbearingly shmaltzy. Despite this, removing it causes far more issues than the quality of the song ever would. The most noticeable is a jarring edit, one of the worst I've ever seen in my life. Even if you haven't seen this film with the song included, you'll almost definitely still notice it and it won't sit right with you. Added to this are the facts that it almost makes the entire character of Belle border on pointless as she's gone faster than she arrives, as well as rendering the whole point of the film's final song effectively moot.\n\nI found myself not sure how to end this review, because I kind of stated my conclusion in my introduction. I also would like to think that my love of this film has been summed up. So, I'll end with this. This review is my first perfect score that I've posted. This is probably more to do with the fact that it's Christmas time more than anything else. When I think about it though, The Muppet Christmas Carol is probably the first film I ever saw that I would have given a perfect score back then and still give a perfect score to now. On that basis, I think it's a fairly appropriate first.",

The puppetry is absolutely outstanding, once again a top notch job from the Jim Henson studio.\n\nMichael Caine's performance as Ebenezer Scrooge was dark, tragic and fun to watch. He didn't do any wacky, crazy slapstick, he played it straight. Very, very straight. The supporting cast of Muppets and humans alike are also top notch which means that you are more likely to feel for the characters.\n\nRemember that first thing I mentioned at the start of this review? Well, this applies in real life and I will admit that I actually felt bad for Scrooge at times which is also a delightful advantage of Michael Caine's performance. After I watched it, I felt hopelessly jolly to the point of not being able to recognise any other december holidays.\n\nGive this a watch, I strongly recommend this movie.",

There's no point in explaining the story everyone knows it. But it comes with a 'Muppet' twist with their patented brand of comedy. 'Gonzo' narrates the story up to the point where the ghosts appear. 'Caine' is 'Scrooge' and as expected puts in a fine performance.\r\n\r\nI don't need to say anymore its a classic in most peoples eyes and I'd almost be incline to agree with them.

            "content": "Jim Henson was without a doubt, one of the most creative minds in both television and movies during his life.  So it goes without saying that in his death, the world lost both a great person and a great mind.  Considering the success of movies such as Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal and The Muppet Show, following up the success of those features while paying tribute to the Henson's memory at the same time would not be easy.  However, Disney and Henson's son made a valiant effort to accomplish both tasks with the release of The Muppet Christmas Carol in 1992.  Now twenty years after the original release of that story Disney has re-issued it onto a new Blu-ray/DVD combo pack for a whole new generation of audiences to enjoy. \n \nThe Muppet Christmas Carol is just one of any number of renditions of Charles Dickens' classic literary tale.  There are so many different takes on the classic tale that it would seem that one needs a program to tell them all apart.  This modern take on the classic tale is enjoyable first and foremost for its general structure.  Rather than trying to be just another take on Dickens' story, it comes across as a stage play on screen instead of a movie.  The sets and musical numbers alone give it that feel.  And the cast's acting adds to that feel, too.  Veteran actor Michael Caine (Secondhand Lions, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises) does an expert job leading the cast as the infamous Ebenezer Scrooge.  While Caine does an extraordinary job as Scrooge, it's The Great Gonzo and Rizzo who take the story's other light.  Unlike other versions of A Christmas Carol in which the narrator is only heard and not seen, Gonzo takes on the mantle of Dickens, helping to guide viewers through the story on screen.  In its own manner, this is actually a visual aid of sorts for viewers.  It's a very valuable aid, too.  The comic turns between Gonzo and Rizzo add for even more entertainment for viewers, as well.  Audiences will enjoy the pair's physical comedy throughout the movie.  At one point, Rizzo falls down a chimney with rather warm results.  And the pair gets knocked off more than one window sill as it attempts to help viewers follow the story.  These are just a handful of examples of how the cast's acting makes The Muppet Christmas Carol enjoyable for the family.  The acting aside, there is at least another aspect that makes this two decade old story enjoyable even today.  That aspect is the movie's general presentation.  \n \nThe acting of both Caine and the puppeteers does a lot to make The Muppet Christmas Carol a believable and enjoyable story.  But it's not all that contributes to the movie's success.  The on-screen stage presentation is what really puts The Muppet Christmas Carol over the top.  As noted already, there are so many renditions of A Christmas Carol out there that it's tough to keep them all straight.  Among that mass of different takes are movies that are obviously take offs of that story, just with different titles.  The Muppet Christmas Carol does the exact opposite of those adaptations.  Rather, it opted to pay homage to the original in its own way.  Instead of trying to be another movie adaptation of the original story, it takes the avenue of being a stage play complete with enjoyable musical numbers and sets that make audiences feel as if they're watching a play on screen.  Combined with the acting, the musical numbers and sets will pull audiences in with ease and keep their attention throughout the near hour and a half story.  And for those audiences who perhaps might have to get up during the movie for any reason, they are treated to something very special courtesy of the bonus \"Intermission\" feature.  The \"Intermission\" feature allows audiences to pause the movie and enjoy extra musical numbers courtesy of other members of the Muppets cast.\n \nSpeaking of bonus features, the bonus features presented in the previous DVD presentation of The Muppet Christmas Carol are carried over to this new Blu-ray/DVD combo pack along with a pair of new additions.  The \"Intermission\" feature is one of that pair of new features.  The other new feature is an interview with Jim Henson's son Brian Henson, who helmed this new take on the holiday standard.  The manner in which the interview was conducted is worth its own share of laughs.  That's because Henson shares the moment with Gonzo and Rizzo.  The three discuss different aspects of the film and behind-the scenes stories that will keep the entire family especially entertained.  It's just one more part of the whole that makes the new 20th Anniversary Edition of The Muppet Christmas Carol fun for the whole family this and every holiday season.",

He's visited by three angels on Christmas Eve who teach him the importance of the holiday and showing good will toward men.\n\n\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" isn't a bad movie. It's just another unnecessary re-telling of a classic Christmas tale. The concept of adapting Charles Dickens' short story and adding wacky characters or updating it was already played out even in 1992. I'm sure children will find it amusing, but their parents will be catching a quick nap amongst the tiny laughter.\n\nMichael Caine is absolutely perfect in the role of Scrooge. He pours his heart and soul into it. The fact that he is surrounded by Jim Henson's hand puppets doesn't affect his performance at all. As far as Caine's concerned, he's starring in a version of the famous tale surrounded by other Oscar-winning actors.\n\nThe film provides good clean family entertainment for everyone. I'm sure it'll be and is considered essential viewing for many during the holiday season. Just don't expect the magic and wit you get when watching 2011's \"The Muppets.\" \n\nhttp://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

Charles Dickens (The Great Gonzo) tells the story of a Christmas Carol with Rizzo the Rat. Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) is a cheap, bitter old man who hates Christmas and everything to do with. When Christmas Eve falls, his apprentices come back from the dead to tell him that three ghosts are coming to show him things and try to change him. It's the basic Christams Carol plot, but it's executed warmly.\n\nACTING:The Muppets were the Muppets and there's nothing to that. Caine did a pretty good job as Scrooge, but I don't believe he was the best at all.\n\nSCORE:This is actually what I love best about this movie; the songs. The songs were written by the brilliant Paul Williams, and they are brilliant as well. Each song is catchy, melodic, and gives of a warm and fun feeling (aside from my least favorite, \"The Love Is Gone\"). The score itself isn't too bad either.\n\nEFFECTS:The effects this movie had were actually pretty intricate; from the morphing doorknob, to the sparkling loss of Christmas Present, to the harrowing portals of Christmas Future. The effects actually had effect!\n\nOTHER CONTENT:Now, this is a pretty good portrayal of Charles Dickens' classic story, but it's most definitely not the best. They say this is a wonderful introduction of the tale to younger viewers, and I agree; the Muppets put a certian charm in it with their humor and beloved family following, but the accuracy to the book is somewhat lost and the culture is lowered. The Muppets give it charm, but take away accuracy.\n\nOVERALL,an ok Christmas Carol with a warmly executed plot, good acting, brilliant score, intricate effects, and the Muppets' charm, but with that charm comes loss of culture.",

This film is all about Scrooge, who is played by a very human Michael Caine. This is truly, the biggest flaw in The Muppet Christmas Carol, because with the muppets getting so little screen time then they deserve, this adaption of the Dicken's story doesn't have much to separate itself from other adaptions. \n\nGonzo narrates, and Rizzo the Rat is there to make jokes. This potentially amusing duo isn't very funny, and is only there to move the story along. In fact, they feel a lot like filler. \n\nAnd speaking of filler, did I mention all the songs in this movie? I believe there were 6 or 7 songs total. Though the one at the beginning is somewhat entertaining, and a genius number by the Marley brothers is highly enjoyable, most of the songs are tedious and dull. They exist only to extend the running time. \n\nYou will be seeing a lot of Michael Caine, which should be obvious because he plays that star, Ebeneezer Scrooge. I expected to see more muppets than humans, but this proved incorrect. Michael Caine performs adequately as Scrooge, but in the end, his performance is a little underwhelming. Also, during the musical numbers, it always seems like he has nothing to do. \n\nWhen the muppets get into the act, the film is more enjoyable, but this certainly isn't first class muppet material. It feels like B-movie muppet material, and that was certainly a disappointment. \n\nThe movie adapts the classic faithfully, and there are lots of fun scenes. And even among a lot of dull songs, there are a couple gems.

While not complex, his presence makes it memorable.\nThe remainder of the characters are filled by familiar Muppet faces; with Gonzo and Rizzo the rat as a pair of omnipresent narrators. All of the favorites are here, including Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie, Beeker and Animal. In addition, there is a whole city full of Muppet extras playing the roles of various citizenry, animals, fruits and vegetables.\n\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is a visual treat with Muppets and Humans intermixed throughout. Coordinating the variety and density of performers -both those on screen and off- was a major accomplishment; and one that pays off with rich, active scenes that always offer something new for the eye. Even after all these years, I continue to be amazed at the range of expression obtainable from the Muppet creations.\nThe film also contains some first-rate special effects; utilized primarily during the visitations of the Christmas spirits. Blended in with the live action, they are both impressive and effective.\nThat the youthful nature of the audience was always in consideration is made apparent by Rizzo's repeated inquiries of Gonzo during the more \"intense\" scenes. Gonzo (Aka Charles Dickens) justifies the exposure as \"culture.\" Similarly, the more horrific elements of the story, such as the ghost of Christmas future, have been imagined with young viewers in mind.\nThe film introduces a handful of original songs written by Paul Williams. They range from average to excellent, yet all are staged with plenty of energy and enthusiasm to keep the story moving along.\n\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is rated G, providing enough sophistication and simplicity to keep both parents and children alike entertained for the duration of the show. If this doesn't get you in the Christmas spirit, then \"Bah, Humbug\" to you.",

However I'm starting to believe that everything really is better with Muppets.  Who would have thought that putting a Muppet twist on the Charles Dickens classic would be so spectacular?  You'd expect it to be another cheesy take on the holiday story that is dumbed down for the kiddies, but instead it is one of the most faithful adaptations of the book.  In fact most of the lines of the human actors are straight from the source material and, while the Muppets do embellish some, the core of the story is entirely intact.  Yet what they do add is so much fun!\n\nA tip of the hat must be offered to the casting department for what they did here.  Michael Caine is the perfect Scrooge, and I'm actually surprised he hadn't played the role before on film.  However it's not just the human cast that rocks.  They found great voice actors to fill in for the late Jim Henson.  While it's noticeable that the voice of iconic characters like Kermit are slightly different, the personality is still there.  Plus the voices of the first 2 ghosts are perfect.  This movie continued the Muppet tradition perfectly, which is difficult without the founder himself.  Perhaps the Muppets will never be quite the same without Jim Henson, but the magic still lives on.\n\nThen we must talk about the wonderful music.  These tunes are catchy and very well written.  They add to the story and are inserted in a way that doesn't stop the pace, but just keeps it rolling.  However, perhaps the greatest aspect of this film is the addition of Gonzo and Rizzo as narrators.  Whenever the story hits a slow moment these guys come in and break the tension.  Their antics are hilarious and keep the humor in what is often a very serious drama.  I really can't muster anything negative to say about this film.  Muppet Christmas Carol is simultaneously a faithful adaptation of classic literature, and a laugh-out-loud romp.  Everything is better with Muppets!",

Ebeneezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) is visited by three spirits over the course of Christmas Eve, who help to bring back his festive joy.\r\n\r\nAs to be expected, aside from Caine, most of the main parts are played by the titular gang. So, we have Kermit as Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as his wife, The Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens, Statler and Waldorf as the brothers Jacob and Robert Marley (Yeah, I know...), even Kermit's nephew gets in on the action as Tiny Tim. The spirits are new creations, with the Henson team having resisted the temptation to have them played by others in the Muppet canon. A move that works well. It's hard to think the resonance of Scrooge seeing his potential would have been as strong if the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come had been played by original choice, Gonzo!\r\n\r\nDespite the prefix, Muppet, in the title, this is a very straightforward telling of Dicken's classic. It's not in the same vein as, say, The Great Muppet Caper, where Fozzie et al would break the fourth wall and give plot points away before they happen Caine recites lines from the set text with barely a knowing glance to the camera. However, don't think it's all straight faces, this is the Muppets. Expect talking vegetables, ice skating penguins, and hardcore republican Sam the Eagle desperately pretending to be English.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's a wonderful 90 minutes and deserves to be on anybody's list of Christmas viewing. But beware, as this is a straight-ish tale... Tiny Tim will die. If you thought you couldn't be moved by a felt pig and frog, then think again.",

It's a different kind of Muppet feature (though it has a sort of brother movie in MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND four years later) wherein the well-established characters are cast in the Dickens roles.  Their Muppet personalities are dominant, but in most cases they match up pretty well, such as the nebbish Kermit as Cratchit, the aggressively corny Robin as Tiny Tim and so on.  Some of them, such as Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchit, just play the Dickens characters as themselves.  A few Muppets make original appearances, like the Christmas spirits, and Michael Caine, though arguably shown up by his Muppet co-stars is serviceable and even great in some of his moments.  The major pitfall for nearly all Christmas Carol adaptations is the tendency to roll through the motions ineffectually, relying too heavily on the familiarity of the story and never really investing.  Now, the Muppets don't strive for big emotional investment, and here the story is mostly a showcase for their antics, so it's already immune to my common Christmas Carol criticism.  Overall, it's very entertaining, with good songs, humor, and just enough pathos.  It slows a bit in the Christmas Past sequence, but it survives.  Stick with the original theatrical version though, because as the DVD and Blu-Ray contain the theatrical and an extended cut, the extended is only different by one musical number, one that slows things to a dead halt for 4 minutes.",

            "content": "Yeah, I know Christmas is long gone with, but I still wanted to do a review of this movie mainly because, well, Muppets. The Muppet Christmas Carol is flawed and not exactly the smoothest ride I've sat through, but it has some entertaining songs as well as a good heart that makes it worthwhile.\r\n\r\nIf you know the story of A Christmas Carol then you know the plot of this movie. It stays fairly close to original, only adding in the muppets (with Gonzo as Charles Dickens) and some song numbers.\r\n\r\nThis was made after the passing of Jim Henson and Richard Hunt, two of the main puppeteers, so I wasn't expecting this film to be the best of the films. And it isn't, but it's not the worst either. The songs in the movie set the palette that both \"Muppet Treasure Island\" and \"Muppets in Space\" would follow years later and are pretty mixed bag. Some of the most entertaining of the songs were cut from the movie leaving us with some songs that are really good (\"Marley and Marley\" often entertains), but the majority sound almost exactly the same (\"One more sleep Till Christmas\", \"Thankful Heart\", and \"It Feels Like Christmas\" all sound almost exactly the same.) It's more than likely because they're trying to stay close to the era, but it's still a little disappointing for muppets. The jokes are a little stale, but there are some good jokes still left that entertain. Steve Whitmire (who has taken over the voice/puppetering of Kermit, Beaker, and Statler) does a good job for his first time and the other replacing puppeteers also do well. \r\n\r\nIf you're a huge fan of the muppets or have really little kids that you're trying to introduce to the Charles Dickens tale, this is a great way to start. It'll entertain kids long enough and still be fun for the adults. Most others may find it sort of silly and fun, but will be left wanting a little more. (Real Rating: 73%)",

The first of these, THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL, which recounts the familiar story of miserly Ebenezer Scrooge's fateful Christmas Eve journey to his past, present, and future, respectively, is a genuine delight. The marriage between Dickens' immortal tale and the Muppets' humor is perfectly realized in this 90-minute musical, highlighted by both a holiday-flavored score from Paul Williams, and especially a strong turn from Michael Caine as Scrooge. His performance deserves a shout-out. Instead of mugging the camera or going for laughs, he plays the role both well and with enthusiasm, even treating his Muppet co-stars like real people. This helps make the atmosphere of people and puppets interacting believable and it lends credibility to the emotional arc of the story. The film also has some surprisingly heartfelt, moving moments that are played very straight -- the scene in the future where the Cratchit's mourn their son's death is tearjerking, as is Scrooge's long-lost love's ballad \"When Love is Gone\" (cruelly cut from subsequent releases of the film). As for the Muppets, they are perfectly assigned to the roles they are chosen to portray. Kermit the Frog, surprise, plays Bob Cratchit, and of course Miss Piggy is his wife (and yes, we get to see their offspring), and in a particularly amusing touch, Gonzo portrays Charles Dickens, who narrates the story (using actual passages from Dickens' book) to a skeptical Rizzo the Rat. The chemistry between these two is hilarious and adds another layer of entertainment to the film. What's also fun is the way that they comment on the story's appeal for audiences and how storytellers are genuinely omniscient. Not only one of the best holiday family movies of all time, but one of the Muppets' best movies ever.",

I've reviewed a terrible direct-to-video Christmas movie they made with David Arquette, and it turns out I've never reviewed the good theatrical release Christmas movie.  Which I don't think I saw in the theatre; despite my family's intense association with the Muppets, we didn't see most of the movies in the theatre, for some reason.  I think probably it was our finances, though they would have straightened out by 1992.  At least mostly.  Still, I've owned this for years, about as long as any other Christmas movie in my collection, and I can't believe I've never gotten around to it.  I am fonder of it than I am of many of the classics, too; I'm not sure I own [i]It's a Wonderful Life[/i] and am not inclined to buy it if I don't.  It is also, as it happens, my favourite version of [i]A Christmas Carol[/i], though I'm notorious among my friends for the fact that I don't actually like Dickens.\r\n\r\nWe, like Charles Dickens (Gonzo the Great), know the story of [i]A Christmas Carol[/i] like the back of our hands.  Still, on the off chance that you don't, it is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine, or Sir Maurice Micklewhite if you'd rather).  He is a vicious and stingy man who mistreats and underpays his clerk, Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog).  He is never kind or merciful and mocks the very idea of Christmas joy.  One Christmas Eve, he is visited by the ghosts of his former partners, Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf).  They inform him that, if he is to escape their doom, he must change his ways.  To that end, he will be visited by three ghosts, the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Yet to Come.  They are what they sound like, and they show him what it sounds like they show him.  We learn what has made Ebenezer Scrooge who he is and what his eventual fate will be if nothing is changed.\r\n\r\nIt's true that I don't like Dickens and never really have.  It isn't actually true that he was paid by the word, not entirely--he was for some of his career but not all of it.  However, he did write serials and was therefore paid by the installment.  I think most of his works could benefit from judicious editing, and [i]A Christmas Carol[/i] is on that list.  (For the curious, I don't think [i]A Tale of Two Cities[/i] needs editing--when he babbles, he teaches history--and I think some books, [i]Great Expectations[/i] among them, cannot be saved.)  However, that doesn't mean he was entirely a bad writer, and my favourite part of this movie is that it captures the good lines which don't make it to other versions, because this version is Charles Dickens telling the story to Rizzo the Rat, which leaves in \"Scrooge climbed the stairs, caring not a button for the darkness.  Darkness was cheap, and Scrooge liked it.\"  This is in fact great character description, which is more important than the ludicrously whimsical names so many Dickens characters have.\r\n\r\nI think it was an excellent decision to cast a human as the main character in this, and I think they cast the perfect human.  Disney, when they did the story, had a character to slip into the role--for heaven's sake, they named him Scrooge in the first place.  But there is no Muppet for the part, and I think creating one would have been the wrong decision.  And while I know that Michael Caine is in fact a funny, charming guy, that's not the Scrooge he is able to portray and does so here.  His own origins were much lower than Scrooge's, but he seems to have a great feel for the nature of the character.  He is a somber man, a dark and dour man.  His life did not go the way he wanted it to, and it soured him.  He didn't deal with it; he held it in and let it shape him.  And Michael Caine creates that Scrooge, lets us into that Scrooge's mind and life.  It's a role played by dozens of men in TV and the movies, and I think Michael Caine is one of the best.\r\n\r\nIt does irk me that they trimmed the romantic ballad, and it irks me even more that the DVD only puts it back in if you choose to watch the film fullscreen.  This strikes me as backward; completists watch things widescreen, obviously.  I can see how little kids might find the song boring, but I think it is an important moment for the character.  This is the first turning point for Scrooge, the moment where he realizes that maybe he'd made a mistake somewhere back in his life.  He's still determined to live with that, I think, but he is finally now forced to acknowledge it, whereas he's probably spent every day since it happened pretending it hadn't.  So.  Does it slow things down?  Sure.  But I don't necessarily think that's always wrong.  There are several movies wherein my favourite scene is one that slows things down, but they're often vital to the story for all that.  And after all, it's not as though [i]A Christmas Carol[/i] is exactly non-stop action even without the song in the middle.",

            "content": "Well there had to be some point where I had to finally start watching and writing reviews to some Christmas films. So let's get started with The Muppet Christmas Carol.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlot: The story is told by Gonzo as Charles Dickens and Rizzo the Rat. Mr. Scrooge is a old greedy money-lender who is more interested in profit than celebration. But on Christmas Eve, he gets a warning from the ghost of his old partners that three spirits will come and attempt make him change his old ways.\r\n\r\n...well... there's not much to say. It's Christmas Carol with the Muppets. Nuthun spectacular about that aside from the fact that it's a nice film that mixed two things that we all love.\r\n\r\nActors/Characters:\r\nMichael Caine/Ebenezer Scrooge:He was good...I just didn't care for the beginning where he made this really creepy grin over how much profit he was making at the time.\r\nThe Muppets: Fun as ever.\r\n\r\nMusic: the music was fairly nice.\r\n\r\nEditing: the editing is nice.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for The Muppet Christmas Carol.  I know I'm not saying a whole lot, but it's just that the whole concept of the film kinda speaks for itself.",

            "content": "I think I've missed the boat on loving the Muppets and it seems I must've not been that much of a fan as a kid either. It was a good version of this timeless tale, full of fuzz and musical numbers, definitely one for the kids. But Michael Caine, you can do better than this (and by this I refer to his acting, not the choice to be in the movie)! This was by no means my favorite version of this story, but enjoyable nonetheless.",
