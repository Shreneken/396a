But when the daughters (Madeleine Stowe, Jodhi May) of a British colonel are kidnapped by a traitorous scout, Hawkeye and Uncas must rescue them in the crossfire of a gruesome military conflict of which they wanted no part: the French and Indian War.",

Phenomenal Acting across the board particularly by DDL. the cinematography is phenomenal with tons of well framed shots, incredibly detailed sets, fantastic action with non stop practical effects and many sweeping epic shots as well. This is shot a lot of times like a live action play. The music is excellent being very memorable and varied. The editing and pacing are phenomenal as well as this effortlessly weaves a love story within a war backdrop to make one epic story that works incredibly well and weaves between the two effortlessly. This is a film everyone should see once.",

            "content": "I genuinely mean that when I say that Last of the Mohicans is spellbinding and that there is a lot to admire from it.\n\nFirstly, Michael Mann's direction is brilliant. Mann is a more than competent director seen with the likes of Manhunter and Heat, and while everything you expect in a Michael Mann film is here(not a bad thing, quite the contrary) it is all done in a professional way.\n\nThe story is a sprawling one, but again that is not a bad thing in itself. Because while it is sprawling in nature, it is also a compelling story lifted by its sweeping action sequences(notably the climax), the love story that is kept in the background but remains prominent and emphatic characters.\n\nThe pace helps too, as while the film clocks in at just under two hours, Last of the Mohicans flies by with no scene feeling too rushed. I also appreciated that the quieter and more subtler moments, as seen with Russell Means' character, didn't drag.\n\nThat's not all. The cinematography is splendid and the settings are stunning that gives the film its epic, sweeping feel. Trevor Jones' score is outstanding, and probably his best since The Dark Crystal.\n\nLast of the Mohicans has fine acting. Daniel Day-Lewis is a commanding lead, and Madeline Stowe is both alluring and convincing, likewise with Jodhi May. Russell Means is suitably composed, wise and well-meaning, but for me Wes Studi's marvellous and quite malevolent performance is the standout.\n\nAll in all, a spellbinding film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

About 2 decades later rewatching this film, taking the book concept out of it, this is a pretty decent movie, slow at first but picks up in action after the main antagonist (The Huron Warrior) leads his crusade against the English and the Native American aides that oppose him. I've actually liked Hawkeye as the protagonist of the movie as opposed to Major Duncan Heyward who was the main guy in the novel. Magua (Huron Warrior) has a more defining presence in the movie than in the book and he brings more meaning in the movie for it. The Book and Movie are different in their own ways but they are also good in their own respective perspectives too.",

This is especially true of Native American characters.  An undergraduate film student could have written a better script. What a waste of Daniel Day-Lewis's acting abilities!  If you must watch this movie, pay close attention to the opening sequence wherein our three heroes are tracking a buck.  Day-Lewis shoots said buck, which proceeds to fall off a ledge with rigor mortis apparently having already set in, i.e. it looks like a yard ornament deer that someone pushed down the hill.  And to think this movie was made 2 years after \"Dances with Wolves.\"  Apparently the director and screenwriters didn't bother watching \"Wolves\" or they would've realized that they weren't equal to the task of making a similar movie.",

He lived on Heathcote in Mamoroneck NY near the great writers of 1800's.  The acting is A, the cinematography is A+ ( that waterfall that you walked behind was real up to 1880 then GE predecessor damned it up at Glen Falls, NY).  Day-Lewis start of his epic career and Stowe: well she was HOT.  Only thing as with book never got how a Lord's daughter would fall for a white Indian.  The historical aspect is very accurate on details of fighting and how life was.  The Native tribes I question as The Hurons were genocides about 50 years prior by the Iroquois Nation: Onondaga, Tuscarora, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca & Mohawk (read either  Francis Parkman's \"History of France & England in the New World\"  or watch the French Canadian movie \"The Black Robe\". The Mohicans were also genocide too except for a scattering around Berkshire MA called the Stockbridge.  Stockbridge & Oneida were our allies in Revolution & War of 1812.  The Stockbridge warriors  (members of Mohicans) were wiped out in a battle on the Van Cortland Park grounds in The Bronx & Yonkers NY border by the British around 1777 by Tarleton & his Calvary.",

            "content": "Despite including Day-Lewis, considered one of the greatest actors of his time, relatively few of the performances seem to be exceptionally compelling, apart from Studi as Magua, whose cold-hearted nature and dogged pursuit still feel sharp. It's Mann's direction in much of the combat scenes (apart from the less well-designed one-on-ones) and the cinematography that set this film apart, discounting several of the shots that are altogether too dark to really grasp what is happening. The romance between Hawkeye and Cora seems rushed and insubstantial, and the plot has a couple of holes (why doesn't Magua just kill Cora and Alice when he has them, given that doing so has been his stated objective? \"So all can share in the honor\" of their deaths, but really to set up the film's later confrontation; it's out of character). The final fight seems muddled and confused rather than climactic, though it should receive credit for allowing a character other than Hawkeye to deal the final blow to the antagonist. The depictions of intimate period warfare and lush environments bring to life a colonial period that is seldom explored apart from nationalistic \"emerging America\" films; the narrative and characters are really secondary to those elements, but they more or less fill the roles to pad out the film. (3/5)",

The story takes place in 1757, during the French and Indian War in the Adirondack Mountains, in the British colony of New York. British Army Major Duncan Heyward arrives in Albany. He has been sent to serve under Colonel Edmund Munro, the commander of Fort William Henry. Heyward is given the task of escorting the colonel's two daughters, Cora and Alice, to their father. He is a family friend and in love with Cora. He proposes to her before they leave, but she does not give him an answer. If you are looking for an action packed movie you have to watch this film. With the main actor Daniel Lewis, who performs perfectly for a native warrior with his brother and father, which you follow their path throughout the movie. Another reason why this is such a fantastic movie is because of the perfectly composed soundtrack which pushes the movie a long and adds tons of suspense which brings you to the edge of your seat. Overall this movie is a 5/5 must watch because it really shows how the French and Indian war really went down.",

British Army Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) arrives in Albany. He has been sent to serve under Colonel Edmund Munro, the commander of Fort William Henry. Heyward is given the task of escorting the colonel's two daughters, Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May), to their father. He is a family friend and in love with Cora. He proposes to her before they leave, but she does not give him an answer. Major Heyward, the two women, and a troop of British soldiers march through a rugged countryside, guided by Magua (Wes Studi), a Huron warrior. Magua leads the party into an ambush. Heyward and the women are rescued by the timely intervention of the Mohican chief Chingachgook (Russell Means), his son Uncas (Eric Schweig), and his white, adopted son Nathaniel Poe also known as \"Hawkeye/La Longue Carabine\", who kill all of the ambushers except Magua, who escapes. The rescuers agree to take the women and Heyward to the fort. During the fight, Hawkeye noticed that Magua attempted to kill Cora and asks Duncan if he knows why. During the trek, Cora and Hawkeye are attracted to each other, as are Uncas and Alice. When the party nears the fort, they find it under siege by the French and their Huron allies. The party manages to sneak in and are greeted by Colonel Munro, who asks Major Heyward about the requested, desperately needed reinforcements. While there, Cora and Hawkeye share a passionate kiss, and Heyward becomes jealous. In response, Cora finally tells him that she will not marry him. When Munro refuses to allow the militiamen to sneak away to defend their own families and homes, as he had earlier promised, Hawkeye arranges it anyway. He stays, however, and is condemned to be hanged for sedition. Before that can happen, during a parley, French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm shows Munro an intercepted message which states that no reinforcements have been sent. Montcalm offers to allow the British to evacuate the fort with honor, keeping their weapons. Munro has little choice but to accept. However, Magua, a French ally, is furious at this arrangement. He harbors great hatred for Munro, blaming him for past wrongs done to him and his family. The following day, Colonel Munro, his soldiers, and their women and children leave the fort. Magua and his Huron warriors ambush them. During the battle, Magua personally kills Munro by cutting out his heart. Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachgook fight their way out and lead Cora, Alice, and Heyward to temporary safety. Later, however, Magua captures the major and the women...\n\n\"The Last of the Mohicans\" opened with critics praising the film for its cinematography and music. Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars and called it \"quite an improvement on Cooper's all but unreadable book, and a worthy successor to the Randolph Scott version,\" going on to say that \"The Last of the Mohicans is not as authentic and uncompromised as it claims to be \u2014 more of a matinee fantasy than it wants to admit \u2014 but it is probably more entertaining as a result.\" Desson Howe of The Washington Post classified the film as \"glam-opera\" and \"the MTV version of gothic romance\". Rita Kempley of the Post recognized the \"heavy drama,\" writing that the film \"sets new standards when it comes to pent-up passion\", but commented positively on the \"spectacular scenery\". Rotten Tomatoes consensus states: \"The Last of the Mohicans is a breathless romantic adventure that plays loose with history -- and comes out with a richer action movie for it.\"\n\nMichael Mann\u00b4s movie adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper 1826 romantic novel is a beautiful epic historical actiondrama adventure with a great lead in Daniel Day-Lewis as Hawkeye/Nathaniel Poe or La Longue Carabine and beautiful Madeleine Stowe as Cora Munro. When re-seeing it today I reckon I would\u00b4ve wanted just a tad bit more of the film, but it is still a great film with striking cinematography and direction. And it\u00b4s set in historical period of my liking. We get the brutality, the beauty, the violence and the rivalries of the time period during the French and Indian War (1754\u20131763) which pitted the colonies of British America against those of New France, each side supported by military units from the parent country and by American Indian allies. The film was originally scheduled for a summer 1992 release, as the teaser posters said, but when Michael Mann's first version clocked in at three hours, he was told by Fox to cut the film down and the release was postponed to September. Mann was never happy with the resulting two-hour version, feeling he had not had enough time to properly trim it, and so Fox allowed him to re-edit it entirely for the 1999 DVD release. Although only a few minutes longer, the new version features minor changes throughout the film. It is Mann's preferred version and the only one available on DVD in the US. \"The Last of The Mohicans\" is a great film that still holds up very well. ",

            "content": "I\u2019ve never been very excited by war movies. It might stem from my lack of interest in history, which means I don\u2019t get all that invested in these famous battles. As a result, it took me some time to start caring about the story in The Last of the Mohicans. What got me on board with the film was the characters and their more personal struggles. Taking the large scope of the French and Indian War down to a much smaller scale where it was all focused on personal relationships was much more effective. The love triangle isn\u2019t written all that well, but at least it gives some strong motivation for the characters in the climax. I also appreciated how the primary villain wasn\u2019t purely evil, he was just driven by an uncontrollable desire for vengeance. Even when some of the bigger things that were going on in the battle scenes didn\u2019t work for me, I was still hooked because I wanted to see how they would resolve the plight of the main characters. The acting is quite good in The Last of the Mohicans, and I appreciated that they cast authentic Native American actors throughout the film. Daniel Day-Lewis appeared dangerous and powerful, so it worked for this role, although I was a little less connected to his romantic scenes. There were also a couple of sequences where we follow him and his family through a battle and it seems comical how everyone ignores them and they are able to run through without being harmed. It had an action movie vibe at times because the heroes were never touched by a bullet or blade and yet they never missed. Also like an action film, it was a breeze to watch, because there were not many lulls in the battle. The climax was the highlight of the entire film, because things really came to a head when all the central characters were brought together. It was dramatic and powerful, I just wish we had a little more time to meet a couple of the supporting characters so that their part in the story would be more emotionally impactful. The Last of the Mohicans is a good film, but it didn\u2019t do enough to set itself apart from other war films in my mind. It\u2019s one I\u2019d like to watch again, though.",

This political thriller that was aspired to be thought provoking feels like you tuned in a prime time news show that grows into a preaching to the choir tone within its first act. It is a long tiring process that Michael Mann, the co-writers and director, wants you to be a part of, why? Also, I couldn't imagine a film confined in its doomed script to ever come off winning, this wannabe Lawrence Of Arabia lacks the romance between the audience and the character that David Lean made sure his film was fueled of.\n\nOn the positive side, the hard work is transparent as water and pays off more than enough when it comes to create these behemoth action set pieces on such a large scale. Michael's passion and Daniel Day-Lewis's skin in the game makes all the effort worth. No matter how many times you find yourself watching the clock, you'd also want to see Daniel pouring his soul in on the magnanimous and generously fierce character. Madeleine Stowe and Russell Means is supporting Daniel and the film thoroughly to reach to a better end.\n\nThe script mainly works on the duality of the war and not the characters, and after its first act, the film gets pretty simple and unbearingly hard to watch. There is a lot of political correctness in the film, which unfortunately is turned up a notch that often undermines the emotions these characters go through and its major asset, the one dramatic scene that it all hinges upon is the major victim of this disease. The Last Of The Mohicans feels more like an Oscar bait than a deep dive on a rich Americana culture.",

From a sudden betrayal and ambush to an endless assault on a fort, this film keeps on giving the audience more spectacle. To tender moments under the stars or a waterfall, then a two pronged sneak attack, then a full out sprinting combat sequence so thrilling you will hold your breath while watching. The Last of the Mohicans is gorgeous, brisk, thoughtful, and visceral at all times. For all its grand battles, it never breaks its realism.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is incredible as the British orphan taken in by Native American Mohican tribesmen. He pulls off multiple accents, tender romance, fierce combat, intense running, and gripping drama. The Last of the Mohicans features yet another brilliant performance from Day-Lewis.\n\nNotably, Wes Studi portrays a monstrous villain as the Huron Magua. He voices at least three separate language fluently, while playing a complexly motivated man on a mission. His intimidating presence is known in every fight. Studi impressed down to his last moment on screen. I think this may be my favorite role of his to date.\n\nLastly, Trevor Jones composed a truly epic score. The romantic scenes are accompanied by Jones' sweet symphony, while the violence is bathed in the blood of his rousing score. This is how you compose a score to fit every emotional cue in a movie. The Last of the Mohicans score resonates just as deeply as the film's story. I love it.\n\nIn short, Michael Mann proves his innovative and in your face style with every frame of The Last  of the Mohicans. This film probably should have won Best Picture alongside Malcolm X or Chaplin. It is that good.",

            "content": "The Last of the Mohicans is a film that takes its time to get the ball rolling, but there is no denying the action scenes and the acting is really good, especially by Daniel Day-Lewis of course. As I said, the film does plod around at times, I think this is mainly due to the fact that I didn't find all its characters interesting, even Day-Lewis seemed to have an underwritten character, despite his stellar work. The romance was interesting, but not as gripping as it should have been due to the amount of time spent on it. The film as has what I considered to be a rather abrupt ending. I probably sound harsh on the film, but in fact I did enjoy the heck out of it. The forest shots and the wide open battle scenes are gorgeous to behold, the action is also very well choreographed, which is almost a standard for Micheal Manns films. While I really dug the filming talent on display here, and enjoyed the overall story, and found the action to be spectacular, I did find this film surprisingly hollow in its characters at times, which was surprising for how much I heard about this film",

The love story, while feeling unnecessary, and an act of pandering to Hollywood conventions, still resonates, since the characters are relatable and have on-screen chemistry. The action scenes are wonderful, with Michael Mann knowing exactly where to place the camera and when to movie it. The score is occasionally overbearing, but still manages to match the tone and setting.

The key romance is underdeveloped, however, with some really cheesy scriptwriting biting the normally flawless Daniel Day-Lewis, and this hurts the film's lynchpin relationship.

At the same time it felt a bit overrated, like the movie is trying to be something that it's not. The action-sequences are great but not more, and it's a very realistic movie with entertaining events. But when it comes to the basic of the film like the characters and the script, it doesn't impress me. The conversations between the characters are slow and boring, and the film overall felt very slow and it didn't get my intrest. The last aspect of the film that totally irritated me is the soundtrack, it's superb but it just to excessive.\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans is not a highly unique film, but it got some good aspects.\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans get a 5.5/10",

Set amdist the throes of the French and Indian War, Michael Mann follows a handful of characters in this romantic historical epic that manages to feel as restrained as it does emotionally riveting. Led by several wonderful performances (including another great one by Day-Lewis, but what else is new?), the strength of the film is in its atmospheric storytelling, utilizing beautifully understated cinematography to recreate a lush frontier America, all but on the brink of revolution. In that respect too, the film makes a point to criticize Western over-expansion while surveying a war between two nations in a land that was never their own. The exceptional climax as well creates a sense of sympathetic nostalgia for cultures and societies that have all but disappeared into the past, snuffed out by the inevitability of time.",

            "content": "For those of you who've studied up on your history and researched the French and Indian War, you would know that it was a disastrously bloody war between two supreme powers, chaotically pitting the native people of America against each other-some tribes siding with the English and others with the French, each promised notable benefits.  The Last of the Mohicans places us into the center of this conflict as a white man, raised by Indians, named Hawkeye/Nathaniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) guides a British group through corybantic rivers and the unpredictable wilderness to their ultimate destination.  First of all-to begin on a positive note-the elaborate, fitting production design is certainly appreciated, as well as some satisfyingly epic battle sequences that wondrously visualize my imaginings of the grandiose battles within the book.  \n\nNow, I'm going to approach my criticism of this film from the perspective of a literature fan who has recently read the actual 19th-century work.  With that in mind, I can say that monumental disappointment struck me not only because of the failed text-to-film adaptation itself but also because it was directed by an otherwise incredibly talented filmmaker (Michael Mann) who has proven time and time again he's leagues above this; I sense this was a director-for-hire sort of project though.  What the audience gets is essentially a classic, important, and spectacular story that's boggled down by safe Hollywood conventions.  The depth and sheer intricacy of the source material is completely lost on this unfortunate Mann production that is so conspicuously influenced by studio restraints.  Considering that this is a nearly 25-year-old film, the remainder of my review will feature major, major spoilers.  \n\nSo, let's look at my first example of the movie's insufficiency: the Huron ambush after the surrender in the novel sees men, women, and children as a part of the English evacuation.  The writing brutally illustrates the initiation of the massacre by a Huron bashing a mother's baby against a rock and then driving a tomahawk into the woman's skull.  Since Hollywood decided to censor this horrific scene from your oh-so-innocent eyes, allow me to rebel and inform you of its existence myself.  Where are all the women and children here?  Why wasn't this prized British fort housing anyone other than the male soldiers?  Obviously, killing a multitude of armed, fully competent men lessens the impact of the ambush and understates the unfair brutality and utter hostility that came with the French and Indian War.  \n\nIn addition, we get-of course-a forced romance subplot that drastically alters relationships and makes very little sense, forcing me to question its exact necessity other than stereotypically pairing the lead with a romantic interest.  Duncan (portrayed by Steven Waddington in this rendition) was involved with the two young women (Cora and Alice) in the novel, establishing an interesting dynamic between the three-an interconnection of confused love.  Duncan in the book was also actually a crucial character who bridged the cultural gap between the Native Americans and white folk-certainly a significant theme of the story.  In this case, that type of complex thematic material is lazily substituted with archetypal white folk who merely desire their land and act with vapidity.  \n\nAnother one of considerable flaws is the motion picture's abhorrently short runtime (under two hours) for such a grandly-scaled tale that not only initially consisted of far more complex relationships and characters but also a superior build-up in the various one-on-one Indian combats and general clashes.  The utter potential is immediately squandered by such a brief duration that cuts plenty of the bulk out, leaving in its stead the Hollywood conventions (of an action film) heretofore mentioned.  Aside from cutting out copious pivotal segments, the film also daringly alters some events and puts a new twist on the narrative such as killing off different characters, filling the viewers with intrigue in regards to how this particular cinematic adaptation can pan out differently. Alas, the deaths don't exactly lead into a brand-new direction for the story--\nno consequences whatsoever-therefore deeming the disparate decisions a little pointless.\n\nThe last act takes a surprisingly dark turn, killing off even more significant characters than James Fenimore Cooper did.  However, the difference is that the impact of theses deaths isn't genuinely felt, regardless of the body count, since barely anyone in this film is adequately developed in the first place.  Uncas (Eric Schweig) is an absolutely major presence in the book as we see his deliberate evolution from a submissive, diffident son to an intrepid warrior who manages to rescue the daughters and formidably face off against Magua (Wes Studi).  In this case-on the other hand-we rarely hear so much as an utterance from him, and the camera is only occasionally placed on his whereabouts.  This fascinating growth of a character is painfully sacrificed for the sake of a climax that's translated through an indolent montage-little to no dialogue; simply following every plot point from the last part of the book to its definitive finish as quickly as the filmmakers possibly can.  \n\nA sweeping score plays as apparently principal people are abruptly (or rather anti-climactically) killed.  Duncan-the vital cultural bridge in the original story, without so much as a discernable personality here-is burned at the stake very quickly.  Alice (Jodhi May)-with very little to do throughout the picture-suicidally leaps off a cliff with a strangely calm demeanor.  Even if this adaptation is substantially unfaithful, it could've at least found other compelling alternatives to explore the setting and relationships, but instead, this turns out to be an obviously rushed and poorly executed action flick that has so much thoughtful source material distantly behind it.",

Daniel Day-Lewis' presence is more appealing and effective than his acting in this romantic war story. The characters do come to life in a very gradual way and the story does weave the intimate with the worldly in a very genuine and captivating way. I wouldn't hold it up to some of my favorite war films, but the movie has a charm about it in the same way Lewis does. This movie is really more about a man who isn't tied to anything, always on the run, until he's finally standing still at the end with someone he can fight for. There's a lot at stake and play here that the writers and director touch on little by little, like historical differences and feuds, honor in family, revenge for slain kin, selfish love, and ultimately fighting for something more important than yourself. It's not the best because I don't feel truly invested in these people and their struggles, but I understand what's good and bad and I want the romance to work and the honorable to win, so in that respect, this is a worthy effort to tell a personal story amidst a time of chaos.",

            "content": "Michael Mann's romanticised historical epic may have been released in 1993 but it has all the hallmarks of classic matinee storytelling, with an unquestionably wholesome leading man attacked by foreign oppressors and guided by his virtuous heart. As the French and Indian war tears across North America in 1757, adopted Mohican Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his brother and father save a British colonel's daughters from the hands of the French and the Huron tribe who fight alongside against the English. After witnessing the bloody injustices committed across the continent, and with a growing affection for one of the rescued girls, Cora (Madeleine Stowe), Hawkeye and his family are drawn deeper into the conflict.\n\nRefreshingly uncomplicated and hugely entertaining throughout, this offers the simple thrills and pure escapism expected of big Hollywood cinema. The pounding emotive orchestral score, which leaves little chance of misreading a character or their motivations, rises and falls beautifully lending a warm nostalgic feeling. The music is almost as monumental as the performances. There is nothing subtle about this film: big emotions playing out in even bigger landscapes. Undeniably inflated and overblown, this is the very secret of the film's success. From the first reel it's a black and white tale of heroes and villains, and the power of pure hearts to conquer all. Never attempting to be anything darker or more complex, it chooses sentimentality over historical accuracy and is all the better for it. This is the kind of film that can be relaxed into. We all know where we're generally heading - sit back and enjoy the spectacle.\n\nAlthough predictable, 'Mohicans' is still engrossing thanks partly to several breathtaking battle scenes that don't shy away from the bloodletting. Gunsmoke and flying tomahawks fill the screen as both sides clash in the forests and plains of the Hudson River Valley - the archaic weapons and setting lending far more danger and brutal enjoyment than their contemporary counterparts. Vicious violence plays in parallel with the swelling pure romance between Hawkeye and Cora, a relationship it's easy to root for in the face of the adversities and cruelties they endure. Day-Lewis makes use of his considerable screen presence to bring more weight to the character of Hawkeye than perhaps is present in the script, a real 'leading man' performance in the oldest traditions of Hollywood.\n\nEssentially a well-executed melodrama with some added bloodshed and a rousing musical score, only the stoniest of hearts will fail to be stirred by this. Back to basics filmmaking that proves straightforward stories produced with passion will always be valid, no matter how tastes change.",

            "content": "With Michael Mann as the director and Daniel Day-Lewis taking on the lead role, The Last of the Mohicans sounded like an interesting collaboration of talent.\n\nAs I never read the source novel The Last of the Mohicans and never studied the historical context of the story, I found myself with a lot of questions watching the film. To a certain extent I was able to ignore that and embrace the themes of adventure and heroism in the film, but there were a lot of things about the film that bugged me. I don't know if the original novel reveals as much context as I needed or if I would have had to study the French and Indian War to fully understand it, but there ends up being enough in The Last of the Mohicans for it to stand alone well as a good adventure film and one with a passionate atmosphere. But I felt like there were narrative flaws in terms of context and the thin story. When I say that, I mean that despite a lot of the complex historical context of the story and there is quite a lot of subtext in the characters, there is actually not too much that goes on in The Last of the Mohicans. I'll admit that the story is engaging and interesting, but as a whole it is a rather thin one. But then again, considering the fact that the source material dates back to 1826 there is only so much it can do to fit into the entertainment value of a contemporary crowd. Michael Mann does what he can to elevate the film and there is no denying that he succeeds, but the slow moving and limited story capacity weighs down on the film as a whole.\nBut there is no denying precisely what Michael Mann brings to The Last of the Mohicans. As director, he is able to successfully transfer the dialogue of the story over to a contemporary film style which gives it the scale and visual style that it truly needs. It doesn't precisely hit the epic scale of adventure or touching level of passion that Dances with Wolves did, but the stories are both very different. While The Last of the Mohicans is more challenging to understand due to only a vague explanation of the context in the story, it still stands out as an entertaining film in many other areas.\nVisually, The Last of the Mohicans is just excellent. The film hits a high point in terms of its visual quality because the scenery of the film is so beautiful and excellently genuine that it gives the film a fine sense of realism. It combines with the production design and costumes of the film to give it true visual beauty. Also, it is all captured with beautiful cinematography which easily captures the scale of the story in its epic form. Everything in the film looks just marvellous, so The Last of the Mohicans succeeds easily as an excellent visual spectacle which broadens its appeal to audiences beyond simply those familiar with the original text and brings it into the 1990's very well on the level of a spectacle which remains entertaining into the decades beyond. The Last of the Mohicans has a true adventure feel as well as some exciting action scenes to it which range from excellently choreographed close contact fights with weaponry to westernized shootout moments. The versatility of these makes the film exhilerating and gives it some truly heroic moments which amalgamate all the spirit of the film excellently.\nThe musical score in The Last of the Mohicans is also great. The film is already rich in atmosphere because of Michael Mann's handling of the screenplay he crafted with Christopher Crowe, but it is further enhanced by the beautiful composition of Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman's musical score. It gives the film an undeniable spirit and really has viewers embracing the heart of it all. It helps to emphasize a lot of the subtext in the story and drive the emotional power of it all even further, so it is one of the finest technical elements of the film.\nAnd on top of it all, the cast in The Last of the Mohicans do an excellent job bringing a level of humanity to the epic scale of the film.\nDaniel Day-Lewis is once again extremely powerful in his leading role in The Last of the Mohicans. It doesn't live up to the quality of his finest performances considering the quality of acting he has given in various other films, but there is no denying that his performance is still excellent. He once again sinks into the role so well both physically and emotionally that he does a truly powerful job conveying the spirit of Hawkeye. The Last of the Mohicans serves as a look at him both as great actor and even as an action hero because the way he grasps his weapons with confidence and strikes his enemies with clean, swift movements. But as well as that, he puts a lot of depth into the role. His voice articulation is spot on because he finds the correct tone of voice and the ideal level of dramatic delivery, so it is easy to see precisely what kind of passion he has for the part. He fits the profile perfectly and makes a truly compelling lead actor to carry the spirit of the film on his shoulders which he is able to do excellently by standing strong and interacting with the surrounding cast members, in particular Madeline Stowe whom he shares a wonderful chemistry with. Daniel Day-Lewis is once again excellent in The Last of the Mohicans.\nWest Studi is also excellent. The actor who has gained a lot of recognition for his strong portrayals of Native American characters in many films really proves why he is so acclaimed in Last of the Mohicans. He plays the role of Magua excellently due to the aggressive energy and dedication to every little detail of the character. He makes a memorable antagonist in The Last of the Mohicans and has some really intense moments, so he adds to the film very well.\nMadeline Stowe also does a very nice job.\n\nSo thanks to a powerful leading performance from Daniel Day-Lewis, some unforgettable action scenes and Michael Mann anchoring the film as the magnificent visual spectacle that it is, The Last of the Mohicans makes for a strong historical epic adventure film which transcends most of its narrative flaws and lack of sufficient historical context.",

            "content": "THUMBS UP\r\nSaw this film on 21/05/2013\r\n\r\nI never really believed that Michael Mann could direct an epic like this. The first Mann film that I saw was Miami Vice(2006), I still regret that. I thought to myself why I wasted 2 and a quarter hours of my life for some action- porn. Then I saw Colleteral(2004), that was when I really liked Michael Mann's work.  I always had the film The Last of the Mohicans(1992) with me, I could have watched it earlier, but I have postponed it a zillion times, I regret that as well. You know what drived me on, thrilled me while I was watching this, it is the background music. I have never ever seen a music as good as this in any epic film. The background score for the last 10 minute climax battle is the best in this film, it is an overload of emotions, praises to whom so ever who did it!\r\n                             \r\nAlso another great plus-point about this film is the cinematography, it is just marvellous. There are scenes where people fall down from the cliffs, it's so so real. Also another favourite  scene of mine is the scene where Daniel Day-Lewis jumps down from a water fall, it is simply realistic, no CGI overload could reproduce such a scene.  As far as the acting is concerned, every actor gives their best into this film. Daniel Day-Lewis is extremely believable as the lead and he is really handsome in here. After 12 Monkeys(1995), this is the first time that am seeing Madeleine Stowe. She brings out a lot of drama into this role and she is one of the most beautiful actresses that I have seen in Hollywood. But the romance b/w the two leads is not that much believable, might be because of the lack of detail in story.\r\n                    \r\nEric Schweig and Jodhi May fit into their roles so easily. Russell Means also acts really well in the second half, especially in the climax. Wes Studi as Magua is one of the most terrifying villains of the modern films. He is a great actor and his flashback story in the first half is actually a rare plot element in this thinly plotted film. I only feel a bit distracted about this film is when I think of the story involved.  But  a tense and gripping direction from Michael Mann and marvellous cinematography can make you forgot all of that. Also the film has a lot of well defined war sequences and fantabulous set pieces.  The violence in this film is really brutal and great, this film is a must watch for all fans of epic movies.\r\n\r\nAlso I would like to know the answer for one thing, what happened to the Red Indians in the America? it was first their land, now where are they? If you could give me an answer then I would like to know it.\r\n[IMG] http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0-PLD5IoHSM/T4rpQzq_XqI/AAAAAAAAByI/BIt4v84uW6Q/s1600/Mohicans.jpg[/IMG]",

However, it was a tough production, with crew members fired during and after filming, but out of it came a compelling and visually amazing drama, which holds the attention from start to finish. In 1757, when the British Empire still had control over the eastern United States, in the north, there was a war going on between the French and the local Indian tribes. Three trappers, Mohican Indian Chingachgook (Russell Means) with his sons, Uncas (Eric Schweig) and adopted white Nathaniel Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) find themselves having to protect Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May), daughters of English Colonel Edmund Munro (Maurice Ro\u00ebves), after the daughters' escort was ambushed. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) wants to marry Cora, but she's attracted now to Hawkeye. It's a beautifully made film, with some brilliant cinematography by Dante Spinotti. This is the film that Revolution (1985) should have been, Mann keeps the pace going smoothly without it going boring, and even Day-Lewis manages to make a good action hero.",

While that may have very well been what Mann was going for it felt false to me. Much of the film's climax seems so abrupt, as if the screenwriters were just trying to find ways to kill off underdeveloped characters in a big way that rounds off the edges. This felt like sloppy and lazy filmmaking. Now, Michael Mann isn't a sloppy or lazy filmmaker, which is why this upset me. Mann showed us with films like Heat, Collateral, and Public Enemies that he has endless potential, and he's better than what he gave us here.

While the British and French (who made an alliance with the Huron) fight their war, Hawkeye falls for a British girl and gets involved in the battles, most of them fronted by a Huron war chief.\n\nLooking for a dazzling historical epic? Looking for a war film with gripping battles? Looking for an engaging love story? This movie fits the bill for all three, because it has a satisfying combination of history, adventure, and romance. The acting from the cast is stellar, with an inspired performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It may be loosely adapted from the original story, but that's a good thing because the movie expands and improves upon it. It has a poetic feel, which strengthens the film emotionally. Beautiful cinematography, a lovely score, and a nice eye for detail are major assets, and they help make an already skillfully-directed film that much more effective.\n\nHowever, there are a few shortcomings. Yes, the pacing is nice and tight, but during the slower moments is when the pacing seems off. The first portion of it was slow and a bit laborious, but, thankfully, the movie gets up to speed after the first half-hour. I was initally concerned that it'd provoke some racism towards/against Native Americans, but thankfully, this film looks beyond racial stereotypes and more towards the morality of the characters, as underdeveloped as they may be. It's more fantastical than historical, but that shouldn't matter as long as the movie is entertaining.\n\n\"The Last of the Mohicans\" is a wonderful flick that works in all its ambitions and succeeds admirably as a romantic war drama.",

I actually don't fault the film, I think that it is just personal preference.  I was led to have very high expectations and I just didn't think that the film was a very big deal.  The script failed as far as creating empathy for the characters and, despite decent acting, I did not care about the fate of the characters until the final 10 minutes.  The film does provide some cool tomahawk action that we don't often see on the screen and all of the fighting is really impressive.  It just loses its impact when the characters involved are dispensible.  Even though I wasn't crazy about the film, it was worth it for its climactic ending.",

The Last of the Mohicans cleverly and effectively mixes explosive action with an intriguing romance, painting a portrait of the adventure and mysticism of the colonial frontier.  Beautifully filmed and wonderfully stylish, this is one of the most appealing films ever made, and never gets bogged down by stuffy British aristocratic dialogue or painfully slow plot developments that plague similar period dramas.  Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a stirring performance as Hawkeye, but it is Wes Studi who steals the show.  His role as Magua, the hate-filled member of the Mohawk tribe who plays every side against each other in his quest for furious vengeance.  It's a shame the academy completely ignored him during Oscar season.  This is without question Michael Mann's best , and in many ways most unconventional, film, and will forever remain a classic adventure movie.",

            "content": "It's under two hours; yeah, some epic. Michael Mann couldn't make a movie about a guy uncovering the secrets of a cigarette company on \"60 Minutes\" without it coming three minutes shy of tacking on a 1 in front of that 60 in the 60 minutes, but hey, this film still stands as pretty enjoyable. Well, to be fair, for me to be satisfied, this film would only have to tell me just what in the world a Mohican is, because I was thinking that it was some kind of Native American, until they dropped the name Daniel Day-Lewis, who is about as white as it gets. I just figured that he heard that Michael Mann was doing a film about Indians and, thinking that it had something to do with \"Ghandi\", went down to audition for an expansion on that random Colin kid that he showed up somewhere as, and yet they took him anyways, even if was too white to be a Mohican, because, come on, like any self-respecting filmmaker is going to turn down the chance to work with Daniel Day-Lewis. Of course, then I watched the trailer and saw him talking about, \"ain't\" and whatnot, and pretty much knew that there was absolutely no way he wasn't adopted. Oh no, I don't just mean that it's obvious that the Hawkeye character in this film is an adoptee; I mean that it's obvious that Day-Lewis, in real life, has to be some kind of an adoptee, because he plays an old-school American too well to be born English. Well, to be fair, he can play anything well, including a Native American, as we see here, and yet, he's not enough to drown up this film's many, many flaws.\r\n\r\nFirst off, allow me to emphasize that I said that this film \"stands as pretty enjoyable\", even with its being too brief to be an epic, not \"works\", for although the film does, more often not, comfortably fill out the clock, there are plenty of points that feel rushed. Some moments of exposition fall limp in the heat of the rushing, creating some gaps in the resonance of the film and leaving it to somewhat go a touch convoluted, as the intrigue is all over the place and the story feels glossed over, making it difficult to exactly discern just what in the world is to be felt or mainly focused upon. Still, even more bothersome than the rushing is, well, the slowing down, because when the film does find time to take a break, things get too quiet and too dry for their own good, leaving the film to, at points, fall limp as, not simply underwhelming, but just plain boring. The film is so very slow, when not rather thrown-together, resulting in an epic that lacks in the way of punch, and it doesn't help that the film is also so very conventional. The film feels too similar to other films of its type, both in storytelling and tone, as it adopts too many familiar tropes that can be foun in similar films; and yes, among those themes adopted is, unfortunately, sentimentality. A lot of these films felt rather sappy and over-spirited, and this film is far from an exception, not being unrelentingly overbearing in its sentimentality, but still delivering just enough of the sap to throw your blood sugar level pretty high up on the charts, delivering yet another good, clean lick to this film and leaving it to fall limp and, yes, even, in some regards, borderline amateur. However, the film manages to hobble its way back up above mediocrity, because although it doesn't at all satisfy as thoroughly as it should, you still walk away having some degree of respect for this film, or, at the very least, its production.\r\n\r\nThe recreation of the French and Indian War-era around the 1750s is slick, elaborate, sweeping and believable, really setting the time without bearing down on you, and it all goes captured by some decent and, at times, also sweeping cinematography. That certainly comes into play quite fabulously during the action sequences, which are far and few between, but always dazzling and grand during the large-scale battles, as well as thrilling during the small-scale duels. Still, during the many points in which there are no cannon's firing or general duke up-puttery, the film slows down, though you can always rely on Randy Edelman's, Trevor Jones', Daniel Lanois' and Howard Shore's fine, big-ensemble-collaborative effort score to hold your attention, even if it is often used as one of the most major devices for beating you over the head with the dramatic aspects. Still, even the dramatic aspects, while often overbearing, are still generally effective, for although this is far from Michael Mann at his best, in terms of storytelling, he still does a workmanlike job of establishing compellingness, while the performers especially draw in the investment. Sure, material is rarely bestowed upon our performers, and a few of our less prominent cast members are rather weak, but as far as the leads go, they are pretty amazing...ly workmanlike. Again, there's very little for our performers to do, so there are no slam-bang performances in here, but most every major performers plays his or her part well enough to earn your attention and investment, particularly the charismatic Daniel Day-Lewis. Really, there's very little to this perhaps, if not decidedly overrated film, though it remains a generally enjoyable film, at the end of the day, and for every major misstep the film makes, it does just good of a job at something else to keep you going and enjoy yourself, more often than not.\r\n\r\nIn closing, the film rather amateurly falls into the story and tonal tropes of many a film of its type, as well as much slowness and sentimentality, and does it all with a lack of epic oomph, made all the worse by some rushing in the storytelling, yet what powers this film on, nevertheless, is, if nothing esle, dazzling production, as well as charismatic enough direction and performances to give Michael Mann's take on \"The Last of the Mohicans\" just enough juice to stay alive as a generally enjoyable mini-epic.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

I honestly couldn't stand Jodhi May.\n\nWhere the movie truly stands out is through its realistic plot of the war between the French and British, along with sweeping and often colorful cinematography, well-directed war and fight sequences, and an epic musical score, especially towards the end.\n\nDespite the aforementioned inconsistencies, Mann proves to be capable in the historical department, making The Last Of The Mohicans a worthwhile viewing.",

The film never knows where to go and the development of the story and the characters is uneven at best.

The onscreen emotions are well played out well and is more of a tribute to the living of the time and the relationship between hawkeye and cora munro. I was a little bit disappointed with the ending simply because it ended with a half-hearted victory. Still with a heavenly soundtrack like that this movie deserves some great accomplishments and recieved its best picture award deservedly.

The script - at least what I could make out amongst the mumbles and the music - skips from melodramatic 'big talk' to deadly dull, which is a shame because the action sequences were very well done, if you're into plenty of violence. Cinematography, costume, attention to historical detail etc all seemed pretty good, but it just wasn't enough to stop me from being very bored after about half an hour. I might not get this on Blu-Ray. 6.5/10",

Mann's attention to detail on the Indians, the battles, the history of each side is to be commended. The movie headlines the love story of Hawkeye and Cora Munro. But its as if Mann glanced over it. There is little to no depth in it. Having there story play out in front of the this chaotic backdrop of a 3 group war doesn't seem right.

They are tangled up in the conflict after saving two daughters from a Major Monro and reluctantly escort them to Fort William Henry. There, revelations are discovered that soon becomes a race against time and humanity. Last of the Mohicans is pretty good flick that was adapted from a novel by James Fenimore Cooper. I wonder if it was loosely based, but there are certain facts that still remain including the scenes with massacre/battle. Speaking of that, I was puzzled by the violence and thought the film was edited by fifty percent, but I guess it is because it was 1992.",

It's not bad or anything, it's just not very remarkable within the trappings of its genre. Mann's direction of the battle sequences are solid, but average, and show a director who's still a little rough around the edges at this stage in his career. It feels quite akin to Braveheart, Dances with Wolves, or even the Roland Emmerich film The Patriot, but it's never quite as good as any of those films. This may be due to its shorter running time than most epics, as that tended to make it less emotionally involving. And when the romance between Hawkeye and Cora begins to heat up, I just didn't really buy it, despite good performances from Madeleine Stowe and the always-enjoyable Daniel Day-Lewis. Russell Means was good, definitely within his acting element, and Wes Studi made a fairly interesting and complex villain. But simply, The Last of the Mohicans failed to engage me. Not a bad film at all, just not a must-see.",

They are captured by Dante Spinotti's breath-taking cinematography: the landscapes, the faces, the war. The battle scenes are both gorgeous and cruel - and emotionally intense: the showdown at the promontory is a classic.

That's thanks to his assured  pacing, the beautiful cinematography and the stirring music combining to marvellous and rousing effect.

It tries to have everything a good epic needs, and it has it, but only because the filmmakers tried really hard to get it in there.\n\nThen again, I am eighteen years behind on reviewing this, so maybe I missed some socio-political context from the early nineties.

At times, this film feels more like a love story that is complimented with war scenes, rather than the other way around. I did find myself a bit bored at times, but by the end of the film I appreciated everything and I had a great time. The visuals are great for 1992, the acting is superb, the dialogue is very sharp, and the action does not disappoint, although there could have been a little more and the pacing could have been handled a little better. \"The Last of the Mohicans\" is a very very good war film and that is a lot coming from me.

The movie follows a group of Mohican trackers who have decided to not pick sides in the war but decide to help out a stranded group of english people get back to their fort.  Along the way they encounter the bitterness of war and what it is doing to the common people who have had no say in whether a war was fought in their country or not.

The historical backdrop was fine but the focus was too clearly on the impending birth of an independent America which is a tiresome premise; especially as the suggestion is that this was an independence movement born of frontier frustrations at the dictatorial crown when it was actually an urban, elite guided movement. Anyway, it was all a bit boring really, though the setting was, of course, stunning and the action was bloody and well-directed.",

            "content": "The epic historical film The Last of the Mohicans is directed by Michael Mann and stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, and Jodhi May. The films take place in 1757 in the American Colonies.\r\n\r\n\tThe films starts off with three of the Mohicans hunting and successfully killing an antelope. Then the Mohicans are recruited by the British Army to become a militia and are promised that if their homes are attacked that they can go back and defend them by Major Heyward. Major Heyward is dating and plans on marrying Colonel Munro's daughter Cora (Stowe). While the Major, Cora and her sister, and other British troops they are ambushed by Native Americans that are supported by the French only to be saved in perfect time by three Mohicans, including Hawkeye (Day-Lewis). From there Hawkeye and Cora begin to start falling for each other as the tension between the Native Americans, French, and British grows in this corny adventure story.\r\n\r\n\tThe plot of this film is extremely weak. It is full of romance and drama... just like every other film except that every other film is remotely interesting. The whole time I was watching this film I was losing my interest because there was nothing interesting going on. Everything was so predictable and many things were just unbelievable. Such as how one of the Native Americans faced about twenty and was able to kill them all. And also at the beginning during the ambush that everyone died that was not a significant part. During the film is was queue brutal murder to make an emotional reaction and queue a minor character's death. It just seemed so staged and traditional that it was not at all enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\tThe acting in the film was not all that great. The great Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors of all time, is not known to be such a great actor for this film. Yes, he did put on a believable accent, but I was not able to feel a connection to his character. Nor could I feel one to Stowe's whose performance was not in any way special. All she did was look sad at certain parts and like she was in love at others. Another poor thing is that I did not feel any connection between their characters. If I feel no connection with myself with the characters or between the characters themselves then the acting is not very good.\r\n\r\n\tThe direction of this film by Michael Mann was under par as well. Anyone can get beautiful shots of beautiful landscape there is nothing noteworthy about that. Mann didn't succeed in getting beautiful shots of not so beautiful landscape, which is what a great director needs to be able to do. A great director also needs to connect the characters on the screen so a connection from the audience to the characters can be made, but yet Mann fails again. Now Michael Mann is a very successful director and he goes on to make some pretty solid films so don't think I am bashing him. It is just good to know that he improves in the future.\r\n\r\n\tThe best part of the film is easily the score. It is moving and provides the emotion that the rest of the film is not able to give. Perfect for this kind of epic film. The film won an Oscar for sound which it definitely deserves.\r\n\r\n\tOverall I give this film a 3/10, due to the fact that it is very bad for the reasons explained above. I don't know why this film is so highly rated everywhere I check, maybe it is not for me. Anyway I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys historical, romance, or epic films.",

            "content": "My, But It Does Go On a Bit  \r\n\r\nRecently, I was involved in a discussion about how evil Catholics are.  It will not surprise you, loyal readers, that I took the position that all kinds of people have been evil, and if we're exclusively looking at how colonists of a religion treated the American natives of wherever it was they were invading, it's hardly as though Catholic atrocities were unique.  I explained various things done by settlers in New England--and that their great joy over slaughtering \"savages,\" even when they knew those savages were innocent of the crimes used as an excuse, is documented in their own words.  It was countered with a claim that a larger number of Inca were murdered.  Well, sure; there were a lot more Inca than Pequot.  I asked for documentation of some of the other claims, and it was not forthcoming.  I bring all of this up because it gives you a background of a lot of how Americans (though the person I was debating is from New Zealand!) filter their perceptions about the Colonial era.\r\n\r\nAnd here is where I confess that I have no idea what was going on half the time.  I gather it is during what in Europe was the Seven Years' War and in the Americas the French and Indian War.  (More on that name in a bit.)  Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), whose name here is Nathaniel Poe so no one will snicker at the name Natty Bumppo, from the book (and why spellcheck recognizes \"Natty Bumppo\" but not \"Hawkeye\" is something I don't get), was adopted into apparently the Mohican tribe (spellcheck doesn't know \"Mohican\"), which happened at the time.  The English are fighting the French, and there are Indian allies on both sides, and stuff.  Magua (Wes Studi) had his family killed by Colonel Edmund Munro (Maurice Ro\u00ebves), I guess, and therefore declares he will wipe out Munro and his bloodline, which means daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May).  And Hawkeye falls in love with Cora.  And there is much fighting in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nYou see, in Europe, the war was being fought for those complicated European reasons which take a great deal more unraveling than I feel like getting into here.  Succession and religion, mostly, with a dash of territory-grabbing thrown in for fun.  Here in North America, at least in the Thirteen Colonies and French Canada, it was almost exclusively about territory.  Doubtless most Colonists couldn't give a fig about the Austrian succession.  I have a hard time caring myself.  But in the places where the war was fought on this continent, there were more immediate concerns.  Working out which tribe allied with whom gets about as complicated as what caused the thing in Europe.  Your city dweller in Philadelphia or Boston didn't really feel much impact from the fighting, but on the frontier, which was considerably farther east then than we think when we think frontier, was the battleground.  Not the fields of Europe here, and any home could be destroyed in the conflict.\r\n\r\nThis is a very dark movie, and I mean that visually.  In night scenes, there is very little illumination so we can, you know, see what's going on.  The light in the forest is pretty much what you'd expect under the cover of trees.  And so forth.  It's an interesting visual choice, but it's one I think would work better were it in isolated scenes instead of, as it feels, half the movie.  Goodness knows it's better than merely slapping a blue filter on the camera and calling it night, but I'd still like a little less of it.  I guess the fact that several important scenes happen at night and by firelight is taken from the book, which I'm given to understand is even more impenetrable than the movie.  Certainly the first physical connection between Hawkeye and Cora doesn't need to be in broad daylight.  However, some of the scenes could have been moved out of, say, dark houses at night and maybe into the open area in front, just in the fortifications.  Or something.\r\n\r\nI've not read the Mark Twain piece about the works of James Fenimore Cooper (Fenimore is right out), but my understanding is that he mocks them as both literature and history.  As I said, I cannot speak to the literature, but the history is vexing at best.  For one, there are still quite a lot of Mohicans about.  Oh, there aren't a lot of them about (though finding population statistics is proving difficult), but there weren't then.  However, they aren't all descended from one guy.  There is also the implication that Hawkeye, there, is himself the eponymous figure.  Which, given he's really, really not Mohican by blood, is yet another of those tedious White Man's Burden-y things which pop up so regularly in American and British media.  Daniel Day-Lewis has to save the Noble Savages, which entertainingly means placing them in even more danger so he can recapture his love interest, who, let's face it, he barely knows.  It's a very pretty movie quite a lot of the time, though it does include Too Long Action Sequence Syndrome.  I'd still give it a miss.",

The LAst of the Mohicans can now be added to that list. My boy Michael Mann directed this movie and he directs two types of movies: stylish and character driven movies (The Insider, Heat, Collateral) and movies that you don't care about for an hour and a half that don't get good until the last 20 minutes (Miami Vice, The Last of the Mohicans). \r\n\r\nI recommend that you all somehow view this movie, but just fast forward to the 1 hour and 37 minute mark and start from there. I promise you, from that point on the movie is very good and you won't miss a thing. The beginning of this movie played out like a really boring and dramatized BBC miniseries. It was about aristocratic British soldiers and the French interacting or something, to be honest I didn't really care. \r\n\r\nThere wasn't much of a narrative in the film for the first hour and a half. It didn't help that I knew nothing about the characters. They were just caricatures that can be seen in similar \"freedom fighter\" or \"cowboys and indians\" movies only with less personality. \r\n\r\nDaniel Day Lewis was absolutely wasted in this movie. All he did was run around and attempt to act heroic. His acting chops could have been better used else where. This wasn't like The Crucible either where Day Lewis's performance was good despite the bad film, Day Lewis really did not do much in this movie. The beautiful Madeline Stowe didn't do much here either. \r\n\r\nI might just have a prejudice towards these period pieces that criticize the aristocratic society (Gladiator, Braveheart) while they attempt to tell cliched action stories. I knew going into this movie that I didn't like the genre, but I wanted to give it a shot since I love Michael Mann and Daniel Day Lewis. Unfortunately, the movie sucked. \r\n\r\nI fell asleep for about a half hour during the movie. I fell asleep at the 1 hour mark and woke up at the 1 hour and 37 minute mark. I considered walking out on the movie, but I really wanted to give it a shot. If I had walked out on the movie, I would have given it the lowest grade I could have given it, but I stuck it out (even though I fell asleep) and was rewarded with a nice 20 minute sequence at the end that had some good action and acting. \r\n\r\nThis is a boring movie with an awful narrative and tired and lazy cinematography (a la David Cronenberg), but hey, at the very minimum, it might be worth it to rent this movie to ONLY watch the last 20 minutes. Remember, just start the movie at the 1 hour and 37 minute mark and you'll enjoy a 20 minute short film. It's just like how Miami Vice was incomprehensible and confusing for the first 2 hours but good with 20 minutes left.",

Having read the book, I much preferred this adaptation over the book. This version directed by Michael Mann has the essence of the book, but with more action. Mann's directing  is as usual stunning, and the way he makes his films is why he's one of my favorite directors.  Here he tells Cooper's story with a breath of fresh air, this version is stunning. Everything from the costumes, acting, film Score is beautiful.  A beautiful film, this film will definitely appeal to history buffs and real film fans as a work to appreciate and cherish. As a reader of James Fenimore Cooper's original book, Michael Mann's  The Last Of The Mohicans is a superior take over a mediocre book. As having read it,  I can honestly say to those who want to watch this film and read Cooper's classic to skip the book and watch Mann's awesome and flawless version of an unreadable epic. Cooper may have created a stunning vision with his book, but he knew jack shit about writing books, It took me everything to finish the book, it was painful. But  the film is worth it, it keeps the basic ideas of the book, but adds more depth and emotion than the book.  to summarize the last paragraph, skip the book watch Michael Mann's version; more emotion, more depth and a better more developed plot. Vieweable film,  not so readable book. This film is stunning, well acted and directed. In time, The Last Of The Mohicans will most likely become a film classic.",

            "content": "Some movies that I see are simply impossible to get into: Miami Vice, The Verdict, The Last Samurai, Syriana, We Were Soldiers, and countless others. The LAst of the Mohicans can now be added to that list. My boy Michael Mann directed this movie and he directs two types of movies: stylish and character driven movies (The Insider, Heat, Collateral) and movies that you don't care about for an hour and a half that don't get good until the last 20 minutes (Miami Vice, The Last of the Mohicans). I recommend that you all somehow view this movie, but just fast forward to the 1 hour and 37 minute mark and start from there. I promise you, from that point on the movie is very good and you won't miss a thing. The beginning of this movie played out like a really boring and dramatized BBC miniseries. It was about aristocratic British soldiers and the French interacting or something, to be honest I didn't really care. There wasn't much of a narrative for the first hour and a half. It didn't help that I knew nothing about the characters. They were just caricatures that can be seen in similar \"freedom fighter\" or \"cowboys and indians\" movies only with less personality. Daniel Day Lewis was absolutely wasted in this movie. All he did was run around and attempt to act heroic. His acting chops could have been better used else where. This wasn't like The Crucible either where Day Lewis's performance was good despite the bad film, Day Lewis really did not do much in this movie. The beautiful Madeline Stowe didn't do much here either. I might just have a prejudice towards these period pieces that criticize the aristocratic society (Gladiator, Braveheart) while they attempt to tell cliched action stories. I knew going into this movie that I didn't like the genre, but I wanted to give it a shot since I love Michael Mann and Daniel Day Lewis. Unfortunately, the movie sucked. I fell asleep for about a half hour during the movie. I fell asleep at the 1 hour mark and woke up at the 1 hour and 37 minute mark. I considered walking out on the movie, but I really wanted to give it a shot. If I had walked out on the movie, I would have given it the lowest grade I could have given it, but I stuck it out (even though I fell asleep) and was rewarded with a nice 20 minute sequence at the end that had some good action and acting. This is a boring movie with an awful narrative and tired and lazy cinematography (a la David Cronenberg), but hey, at the very minimum, it might be worth it to rent this movie to ONLY watch the last 20 minutes. Remember, just start the movie at the 1 hour and 37 minute mark and you'll enjoy a 20 minute short film. It's just like how Miami Vice was incomprehensible and confusing for the first 2 hours but good with 20 minutes left.",

Mann delivers a great epic film set during the French and Indian War. It does everything very well. It gives the setting of the war. For people who didn't really know what the French and Indian War was about, it makes it pretty easy to understand without making the dialogue sound elementary.\r\n\r\nDaniel Day-Lewis has an amazing performance. Another peice of his acting puzzel that has come to say that he is one of the best in the business. Stowe is just as good as the female lead. She plays the part very well. A great mix of fear, courage, and reality into her role made it very memorable.\r\n\r\nAnother character that was brilliant in the film was Magua, the so-called villian of the movie. Wes studi has been in a lot of movies that involve native americans. Non more better than this one though. I havent seen this movie is about ten years at least (until yesterday), and the visual that I remembered was Magua in the forest with the black paint on the lower part of his face...just looking very evil. Then ofcourse he cuts out the heart of the English General. A great evil role that really put a lot into the movie.\r\n\r\nMann uses some great camera angles as well in this film. Some that come to mind are the wide shots of the bombing of the English Fort and the wide angle of the Huron Indians attacking the English party from the forest. It seemed so realistic from the outset. It didn't seem scripted in any way. it's hard to make shots in movies not seem scripted what so ever.\r\n\r\nA great epic film that has it all. acting, directing, visuals, action, romance, history, etc...",

This film affected me like no other had.  It was a huge film in scope with stars, costumes, grand settings and wildly imaginative vignettes. The action sequences were grand in scale and the sound and cinematography were the best in the business.  But none of that matters if you don't have a strong story. This...was one of the best. And I don't mind saying I openly wept during the final act.  \r\nDaniel Day Lewis lived off the land for 6 mos before taking on this role. His costume was hand made and he lived in it for a period before filming. His rifle is a beautiful example of the classic Pennsylvania long rifle - which is all too frequently misnamed the \"Kentucky\" rifle. Considered by many to be among the most beautiful firearms ever crafted, his rifle fired and was fully functional.  Lewis used this rifle to hunt while he survived off the land before filming.  \r\nRandy Edelman's score has been widely considered the finest score set to film. John William's Star Wars score is, of course, the most popular but this score is considered more evocative and less invasive.  I timed the mountain battle scene after the Huron chief says Magua is to marry Cora Munro. The score starts in and stays with you (this Scottish theme, mind you) for almost 14 minutes until the climatic battle on the hillside.  \r\nAlamo is talking about showing this on their big screen revival. I will be front and center.  \r\nHere is an example of Edelman's score...\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0CqVbZCFFI near perfection.

Hawkeye and Cora In the midst of the French and Indian War will have their love will tested by fate as British and the French along with their Native American allies engage in brutal, bloody warfare. Superlative performances by the entire cast with Wes Studi a standout as Magua, a murderous revenge seeking Huron warrior who is one of the fiercest and most hateful villians in screen history.

The storyline is about some women getting escorted from place A to place B all the time, indians attacking the escorts and some other indians beating the shit out of the attacking indians. Wow, that's fucking interesting. \nThere's also some kind of explanation for those events, but hey, are you really interested?\n\nIt's because some british dude had killed some indian's wife and kids, the indian is so pissed off he wants to kill that british dude and his daughters. Because this one white guy pretending to be an indian (Daniel Day-Lewis) has sex with the other daughter, he's compelled to protect them. And those bitches want to go everywhere all the time, so its' gonna be hard times for Daniel Day-Lewis protecting two whiny-ass chicks in their pretty dresses in a fucking forest. \n\nLike I told you, it's not interesting. At all.\n\nThis movie is stupid. It's so stupid I wanted to stop watching it. The dialogue is boring. The characters are 1-dimensional and irritating, the directing is chaotic, the storyline is stupid as hell, music is kinda good but not epic and it's SOOOOOO lame compared to Dances with the wolves, which is one of those legendary 90's movies I had to watch now, almost 20 years later, 'cause I missed them in the 90's.\n\nI didn't hate this movie, but I didn't feel any sympathy towards it either. It's just so dull and so plain and so boring. I can really imagine why this was so celebrated in the 90's. It was meant to be \"epic and historic and likeable\". I just didn't feel that this movie gave me any insights into lives of the indians and the tension between them and the white men. \n\nBoring.",
