    "summary": "This film presents five stories, each involving a cab ride and set in a different city around the world. In Los Angeles, no-nonsense taxi driver Corky (Winona Ryder) gets an engaging customer in the form of a Hollywood casting agent (Gena Rowlands), while a Parisian cabbie (Isaach de Bankol\u00e9) must contend with some rowdy African diplomats. Among the other tales, a standout is the Italian taxi ride that finds quirky driver Gino (Roberto Benigni) making a lively confession to an ailing priest.",

Jim Jarmusch's Night on Earth is a film about principles, joy, sorrow, misgivings, and passion, among other things.  More polished than the movies that preceded it, Jarmusch never loses sight of what makes his films so relevant \u2013 his characters.  While the segments vary to a degree in quality, they are all both entertaining and insightful, never losing sight of what qualities it takes to make us human.",

            "content": "Of course the opening song is Tom Waits lol. It's got that offbeat kind of peculiar Jarmusch charm to it. Really fascinating how they filmed Earth like that. It looks like a balloon resembling our planet. I like the creative way they filmed the globe with the pertaining cities in which the film takes place in. \n\nInteresting how Winona's character and the older blonde lady come from two completely different walks of life, yet, this night in Los Angeles they meet. Jesus, I think that's the most unattractive I've ever seen Winona in a movie. I mean she's still cute as hell. I love how tomboy she is. How she doesn't give a shit. I always forget how good of comedic chops Winona has. She definitely makes me laugh and smile. Wow, Winona's character just turned down the biggest opportunity of her life probably. To be a movie star! People would line up in the millions to be in the position she was in that night! But I can definitely admire and respect her loyalty towards the things she really wants to do with her life, like eventually become a mechanic. That's admirable, she knows exactly what she wants in life. She knows she doesn't want the movie star life. \n\nAh New York City, the melting pot of melting pots. So crazy seeing Giancarlo Esposito so young. I almost didn't recognize him, but I knew his face was familiar. He plays a very lively and animated trendy guy who's just trying to get home to Brooklyn who ends up helping out the newly transitioned foreigner get situated with his cab and his new job. He's showing him the ropes, even introducing him to New York! Even ends up driving for him! What a thoughtful and nice dude. I love how they all end up getting along all thanks to Helmut playing his little recorders. These people would have never met if it wouldn't have been for the taxi ride - serendipity. \n\nAh Paris, je t'aime. Omg the two guys from Cameroon in the back of the cab are hilarious. Damn the cab driver straight up left them in the middle of some ghetto lol. Well, that's why you shouldn't fuck with cab/uber drivers. I love how he thinks he won't get any shit from the blind girl, yet she gives him flack about the sign in the back of the seat lol. The drivers problem is that he's too uptight and prideful. Doesn't seem to like his job or just tired. I love how deep the blind girl is. She doesn't see colors but feels them and feels movies, and music. Although she's blind, she's very quick witted and smart. And actually very attractive. How ironic how it ends with the cab driver getting into an accident with another car while the blind girl walks away. She's more aware, more in tune and way more educated and less ignorant than the cabbie. \n\nI love Roberto Benigni man. He's so charismatic and funny, and kind of crazy lol. He's so kinetic and animated, lively. This one was probably the funniest one out of all of them. The way he confesses to the priest how he fucked a pumpkin when he was a kid as a means of release was hilarious to watch. And then he goes on telling the priest that there was a period in his life where he made love to a sheep named Lola who he was really sweet with. LMAO!! The way he delivers his stories is impeccable man. The way he says, \"Oh!\", is so hilarious. His stories were so shocking and filthy that he gave the priest a heart attack lol. \n\nHmm, I wonder what made Jim pick Helsinki out of all places. I mean cuz there's Stockholm or Oslo or even Amsterdam. But he is right, it is a very well-lit city. Yeah, Mika's story was pretty sad but the compassion from the passengers is sweet. Goes to show you never really know what other people are experiencing in the lives, they could be going through hell and you might not even know it. That's why you got to be nice to everyone. \n\nNot only is this a good character study on people from all different walks of life, but it's also a director's love letter to some of his favorite cities in the world. The way Jim films these cities, it's like he's a curious kid filled with wonder. He really gets a feel for the city at night and really captures the essence and soul of the place. The dynamic between the characters in this movie is very fascinating to watch. The acting felt genuine. The whole movie ends up being a pretty wholesome and entertaining experience between strangers that would probably never have met if it weren't for being in the same taxi. I really liked it.",

            "content": "I think whenever you crave a late night out but can't get out of your bed you'd better watch a Jarmusch film instead while lying on your bed under a blanket with a big cup of tea in your hand. The common element that can be traced in all of his films is that he captures these laid-back vibes of such nights to a tee. In Night on Earth, we see nocturnal cityscapes of gloomy, empty streets before getting in a taxi with eccentric yet amicable strangers of different cultures, ceaselessly chatting over trifles of otherwise moral value, all while the tires humming over the asphalt roads and the cool, fresh night air tapping on the car windows. This is basically the whole movie!\n\nThe five-segment anthology takes place inside taxi cabs across five different cities on the same titular night. The first one is set in Los Angeles, and features a chain-smoking, gum-chewing, tomboyish taxi driver (Winona Ryder) and a classy casting agent in Hollywood (Gena Rowlands). This is probably my favourite out of all the five vignettes next to the second one, which takes place in New York where a German cabdriver (Armin Mueller-Stahl), with a background that remains ambiguous, is lost in a city and culture he doesn't understand. This one genuinely got a few chuckles out of me. The third episode, that's in Paris, is relatively a bit heavier on its message but is more than made up for it thanks to a brilliant Beatrice Dalle as a woman with hyper-acute senses compensating her lack of sight. In the fourth one, which takes place in Rome, we witness Roberto Benigni being Roberto Benigni as he confesses his sins to a priest (Paolo Bonacelli). The final one taking place in Helsinki is by miles the bleakest of them, imbued with a deadpan undertone but suffused in a sorrowful and grieving tone.\n\nJim Jarmusch values the brief, ephemeral encounters of people who had never met before, and likely would never meet again. People of nature peculiar to yours but actually quite normal once you get to know them. It's all about everyone's own attitude to life; everyone's priorities shaped by their own environment or according to their life path of their own choosing. And without Jarmusch's signature languorous aura that ties up all the segments together and casts a magical spell on the mundane to turn it to something rather celestial, this night on earth would've been a lackadaisical one with nothing memorable.",

Now, nearly 30 years later, this is just a fun movie to look at for people who remember life before Uber, before the internet, before everyone recording everything with their phone, and before micro managing every aspect of life from a phone or tablet.  Really, it's a movie about nothing and more of a character study that is set in taxi cabs around the world in a series of unconnected stories.  It's entertaining and not an aneurysm inducing headache.  Didn't care for the subtitles, or rather the necessity for them, but I see the reasoning for it's being that way.",

Btw the movie has no subtitles for the non English parts. And the reason I say the first hour of the movie is the best part it's because it's 2 hours and 5-minutes to be exact in total. And looking at the New York and Brooklyn backdrop compared to the other cities that we see it's no reason why most movies are made in America because it's so much better for cinematography and backdrop. I only watched the movie because I really like Gena Rowlands and I have a soft spot for a Winona Ryder to and and as always they were both excellent.",

            "content": "Witty jokes with thoughtful insight through the eyes of taxi drivers.\n\nJim Jarmusch's hilarious dramatic comedy Night on Earth (1991) is a haze of clever script writing and beautiful cinematography. Jarmusch's direction is so interesting and always keeps you guessing. The plot is non-existent, so you just get to revel in these intimate character interactions.\n\nNight on Earth is particularly dazzling for it's brilliant script. Jarmusch's writing leaves you with no empty spaces. He gives you five taxi cab drivers and their variously assorted passengers. Night on Earth is a slice of life film, but from the grounded perspective of these taxi drivers. It's like the striking direction and realism of a Martin Scorsese film with the humor and strangeness of a Coen Bros. movie. Night on Earth is incredible.\n\nTom Waits' score is interesting and multi-faceted. The odd folk and blues of Waits' music is blended between genres as Waits specially matched the worldly genre style of each film location with his music. The Los Angeles section is a dreamy blues rock number. The New York section is atmospheric jazz. The Parisian sequence is French jazz. The Roman portion is goofy off-kilter polka type jazz. Finally, The Helsinki finale is a combination of polka and somber blues. Tom Waits really expanded his horizons in capturing music that sounds authentic to each locale, while resembling his own style. I loved Tom Waits' score for Night on Earth.\n\nNext, the entire cast of Night on Earth is a remarkable assembly of actors, whom are favorites of Jarmusch, pretending off of each other to mesmerizing effect.\n\nNotably, Winona Ryder is a tomboy taxi driver named Corky. Ryder sheds her famous cute image for a chain-smoking, gum chewing, tough girl dreaming of being a mechanic. Her realistic portrayal feels so grounded that it's funny seeing Winona play so opposite her type. She kills it as a girl that just wants a family and to drive her cab. Her humble dream of being a mechanic is as endearing as Ryder's performance of this young rascal. She fits no mold and breaks the stereotype of every girl in Los Angeles wanting to be a movie star.\n\nGena Rowlands is excellent as the typical Hollywood casting agent. She is so stuffy and proper that it's funny. She plays off Ryder's bombastic character with a cool cavalier attitude. Her confusion at Ryder's rejection of her casting offer is great. I love this initial L.A. introduction to Night on Earth.\n\nThe New York section is very fun as Giancarlo Esposito is just playing an everyman trying to get home to Brooklyn in the cold. He gets picked up by the only cab driver to stop for him, who happens to be Armin Mueller-Stahl, who cannot drive! It's a humorous situation made into ridiculous fun with the addition of the always loud and adorable Rosie Perez.\n\nThe Paris portion of Night on Earth is a beautiful satire on racial dynamics and visually impaired tropes. Isaach de Bankole is such a tread upon taxi driver that you feel sorry for him. Normally, the blind woman would be the sympathetic figure, but Night on Earth reverses this trope with the alluring and belligerent Beatrice Dalle. Her sarcastic French moaning is delightful and her performance as a blind woman is magnificent. I am astounded by the wit and commentary within the Parisian portion of Night on Earth.\n\nThen, there is Rome. Roberto Benigni is gut busting throughout the entire Roman bit in Night on Earth. Benigni can talk endlessly to himself and still be entertaining. His performance gives it all and then some more that you didn't even know you wanted. I have to hand it to Paolo Bonacelli for keeping a straight face as the priest in the backseat of Benigni's taxi. I think most audiences will laugh the hardest here.\n\nLastly but certainly not least, the Helsinki taxi trip in Night on Earth is the most dramatic and moving part of the movie. Matti Pellonpaa is the quiet serious Finnish taxi driver, who delivers the most exquisite monologue on life's perspective that really gives Night on Earth a memorable morale. He is genuinely amazing and sympathetic. I also liked the three guys in his cab played by Kari Vaananen, Sakari Kuosmanen, and Tomi Salmela. Their riotous zeal and drunken stupor are the perfect foil for the steely Pellonpaa to act opposite.\n\nOverall, Jim Jarmusch's Night on Earth is a delightful experience of joyous laughter and thoughtful commentary. The drama is heartfelt and touching, while never feeling overly sentimental. Jarmusch's direction and script are stellar as is Tom Waits' score. The incredible cast is outstanding as is every Jarmusch ensemble. Night on Earth is simply one of the greatest films I have ever seen and absolutely nothing happens.",

In addition to a dreamy casting for every single story, it is finally the profoundly human and realistic part that touches the spectator. From the hollow conversation in the first fare to the touching story of the last, passing through Roberto Benigni's unsuccessful confession (at the top of his art), each and every story mesmerises us with the help of the night atmosphere. Supposed to be simple night taxi stories, their symbolism and their poetry go beyond the setting they are set on. The diversity of the roles and the stories as well as the places and cultures, mixed with a desire of originality, transform \"Night on Earth\" into a cult movie that, despite its five stars cast, is too often forgotten. Big mistake because after seeing this movie, you will never see a taxi in the same way as before!\nFull review on our blog Los Indiscretos : https://losindiscretos.org/english/night-on-earth-1991-jim-jarmusch",

            "content": "I feel safest at nighttime, not on the streets but in the sheets, cemented to my bed with my laptop by my side.  These summer nights seem to beg me to stay up until the earliest hours of the morning, and it's hard not to comply - at two pm, there's nothing in the world stopping a friend from asking you for a favor, a grandma inviting you to move furniture for an estate sale, a parent demanding you mow both lawns, take out the garbage, and clean your bathroom.  But at two am, every one of those people is asleep: nobody expects anything from you, and, for once, the stresses of reality cease because no one else is throwing them in your face.  Nighttime is a period of spooky solitude, elusively appealing.\n\t\"Night on Earth\" divides itself into five vignettes, all set during these wee hours, all involving the relationship between a taxi driver and their temporary client, all in a different city.  Directed by Jim Jarmusch, one might expect a deadpan drama of steeping revelations and scintillating conversations, in the way \"Broken Flowers\" could make even the most awkward of an exchange blossom with black hilarity.  But \"Night on Earth\" is wildly uneven, some of the segments mostly involving, others splendidly acted but unsuccessful in their rendering.  I've always felt that a movie comprised of short films should be so arresting in each segment that it wouldn't be unheard of to pine for a longer, feature adaptation.  But even in its best moments, \"Night on Earth\" is slight, some performers more pleasing than others - a difficulty when some segments are damaged by particular characters.\n\tThe first vignette, set in Los Angeles, stars Winona Ryder as the cab driver, Corky, Gena Rowlands as the passenger, Victoria.  Corky, young and spunky, chain smokes, chews bubblegum, and figures that her dream career is that of a mechanic; Victoria, middle-aged, welcoming, and refined, is a casting agent looking for fresh talent.  She sees a spark in Corky, figuring her rough-and-tumble attitude could be assembled into a rebellious, cool product headed toward stardom.  This segment, though dampened by Ryder's unconvincing portrayal of a grungy youth with small dreams, makes an impression thanks to the always lovely Rowlands, who makes what could be an unlikable character affectionate, motherly even.\n\tThe second, stationed in New York and headed by Armin Mueller-Stahl, Giancarlo Esposito, and Rosie Perez, is the second most annoying of the segments: driver Stahl, a German immigrant, hardly knows how to drive, so his customer Esposito takes over the wheel and loudmouths his way through awkward silences.  Midway through the trip, the two pick up the shrill Perez, who happens to be Esposito's sister-in-law.  The vignette could be enjoyable, with Stahl sweetening the atmosphere as a gentle giant, but Esposito and Perez are so obnoxious that we can hardly wait for the short to be over.\n\tThe third sequence travels to Paris, by far working as the most straightforward, best written moment in the film.  Here, a blind woman (B\u00e9atrice Dalle) gets a ride from an endlessly pissed off driver (Isaach De Bankol\u00e9) who rethinks his usual grumpiness after she gives him a run for his money: the woman, it seems, is scorned by life and completely disregards her ailment, scoffing whenever her cabbie asks an inappropriately curious question.  The segment works so well because of the rapport between Dalle and Bankol\u00e9 - whereas the other shorts attempt to have the characters find a mutual understanding between each other, Dalle and Bankol\u00e9's mutual curiosity/disdain bears an odd sexual tension, fascinating just enough to leave us potentially wanting more but backing off when considering just how well it works.\n\tI won't go far into the fourth sequence (set in Rome), which is jaw-droppingly irritating as comedian Roberto Benigni delivers a mile-a-minute performance as a cab driver who just won't shut up.  If he's annoying to his guest then he's annoying to us as well - don't expect to want to do anything besides fast-forward as his mouth runs into oblivion, us preferring deafness to hearing any more about another one of his sexual experiences.  Following the exasperation of this vignette, \"Night on Earth\" ends on a melancholy note as it hits the snowy streets of Helsinski, with a group of passengers complaining about how horrible their friend's day was until the driver decides to top it with a soul crushing experience himself.  \n\tWhile I appreciate Jim Jarmusch's enviable ability to turn realism into sardonic astuteness, \"Night on Earth\" feels more like a filmmaking exercise than an actual film.  It doesn't move - it serves as an experiment pleasing only the people involved while the audience sits and waits patiently for something moving to happen.",

I strongly suggest to any Italian, and to any person that loves Italy, to boycott Jim Jarmusch forever. \nA horrible movie, when not empty and/or stupid, full of prejudices and prone to the most hideous racism.",

            "content": "Uncertain about what I was really going to face in another Jim Jarmusch film, I went into Night on Earth with nothing but uncertainty, but I had hope that a collaboration featuring both Winona Ryder and Roberto Bengini would be very entertaining.\n\nThe concept of a taxi driver interacting with clients is a very interesting concept to me because it allows characters to learn from each other and speak with utmost honesty. The premise fascinated me in Michael Mann\u00e2??s 2004 crime thriller Collateral, although it began as a similarly themed drama to Night on Earth and later unfolded into a crime thriller. In Night on Earth, all the important focus rests on the interactions between the complicated characters, and it is actually very interesting. While as the film covers five stories, some which are less interesting than others, Jim Jarmusch\u00e2??s iconic film style and intelligent screenplay renders it a consistently successful feature.\nNight on Earth can be summarised by having its five stories split into various sections, so that is the way I will structure this review. And before I do go into details I will say that the entire feature is filmed with strong quality cinematography which stays true to the details of the characters and keeps the scale down on the character-driven level of a Jim Jarmusch film. Also, it is all edited very well and features an excellent screenplay. The screenplay in Night on Earth gets into the minds of the characters easily and allows the actors to give it their best without problem, and it creates an insightful and entertaining universe which introduces interesting concepts and themes to the film and never looks back\nThe first story of Night on Earth gives it a really good start, as it shows the communication between a young tomboy taxi driver and a female casting agent. The interaction between the two characters is fairly funny and insightful too, particularly in the final scene. The last moment of this story has Victoria Snelling offering a part in a film to Corky who politely refuses, ginving up the potential for \u00e2??Every girl\u00e2??s dream\u00e2?? for what she wants to do in life. The way that she refuses to be seduced into the more commercial industry and instead wants to stick with simply what she is good at and what she wants to do for herself reflects the way Jim Jarmusch has consistently remained one of the most consistent contributors to independent cinema without going into big-budget material which is used more as a commodity than a thought provoking film. The character Corky is a great one and reflects part of Jim Jarmusch himself which is admirable.\nWinona Ryder is one of my all time favourite actresses, and I love it when she takes on very character driven parts. So to have her playing the lead in a segment of Jim Jarmusch\u00e2??s film which partially reflects himself as a human is just excellent. Winona Ryder\u00e2??s charming charisma dominates the screen, even against two-time Academy Award nominated actress Gena Rowlands and her sharp and witty line delivery is perfect for the atmosphere of a Jim Jarmusch film, and she kicks the energy of the film off to a good start.\nGena Rowland\u00e2??s performance is also an effective one, largely because of her confidence and because of the strong comic charisma that she shares with Winona Ryder as the characters unfold on the screen. Gena Rowlands gives a certain sense of wisdom to her character and delivers her lines with grand strength, and so the relationship between her and Winona Ryder give Night on Earth a great start.\nThe second story is rather interesting as well, mainly because of how the actors handle the material. It is a simple story which reminds us of the humane frustration that comes with dealing with a person that cannot do their job properly while also creating a situation in which the audience can easily sympathise with the man who fails to drive his taxi well enough or take directions intelligently due to his lack of strong understanding of the English language. This part of the film depicts the cultural difference between Germany and America and is full of interesting characters, and the way the actors interact with each other is so real that it is easy to feel the same thing as the characters and have a laugh in the process.\nArmin Mueller-Stahl manages to perfectly depict the archetype of the annoying foreigner who fails to do his job correctly, but he manages to charm audiences into easily sympathising for him with an emotional line delivery and a general sense of friendliness. Armin Muerller-Stahl takes on the role with ease and makes himself a strong presence.\nGiancarlo Esposito who would later take on the unforgettable role of Gustavo \u00e2??Gus\u00e2?? Fring in Breaking Bad gives a performance a lot different in Night on Earth. I didn\u00e2??t even recognise him as being the same actor in both roles because his less restrained performance in Night on Earth unleashes his natural acting charisma which is easy for audiences to connect to. His conveying of frustration is done with ease and natural acting strength, and his chemistry with Armin Mueller-Stahl is the source of much laughter.\nAnd eventually Rosie Perez enters the picture, and her natural hilarious energy manages to make her a genial presence that results in making the scene all the more appealing. It gets funnier the second her voice is heard simply because ever since White Men Can\u00e2??t Jump I have learned to associate her voice with comedic material, and I found her naturally funny all over again.\nThe story sort of takes a slight dip in quality by the third section of the film simply because it becomes very repetitive. The first half is mainly obnoxious characters pushing the limits of a taxi driver until he kicks them out, followed by a tense discussion with a blind woman. While we get some kind of insight into her, there isn\u00e2??t too much and this section of the film simply isn\u00e2??t as intelligent or entertaining as the previous ones had been. And while the performances of both Isaach de Bankole and Beatrice Dalle are effective, the strength of this scene simply is not as effective as the preceding scenes and proves to be a letdown.\nThe fourth segment in the movie takes on the story of a man suddenly confessing all his sins to a priest. This scene had the potential to be both a deep and meaningful situation and a comedic one, and it chooses to be the latter which neglects the potential for its dramatic depth and tries to play things out comedically. But it isn\u00e2??t as funny as you may hope which is a shame because it has Roberto Benigni as the main actor in the scene. It has its funny moments because of him, but it is stretched out for a bit long and pushes the limits a bit. This scene isn\u00e2??t too impressive, but it serves as a great front for the immense acting talents of Roberto Benigni.\nI always believed that Roberto Benigni is the greatest Italian actor of all time because his lead performance in La Vita e Bella is the single greatest acting performance I have ever seen in anything ever in my entire life, and he deservingly won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the efforts of his performance. The entire scene revolves mostly around his ability to give a soliloquy with confidence and ease, and while the scene itself isn\u00e2??t perhaps as entertaining and insightful as it could have been, the performance of Roberto Benigni is a powerful and dedicated testament to his ability to hold the screen. Roberto Benigni\u00e2??s quick wit and sharp line delivery ensures that he gives a powerful performance, and it is just terrific to see him working with Jim Jarmusch.\nPaolo Bonacelli also gives a decent effort in this scene.\nThe final story of Night on Earth chronicles three men attempting to hep their drunken friend after he has been fired from his job and chased out of his house by his wife with a knife over in Helsinki. As his two friends consider the sad reality of the situation, the cab driver tells them a story of real sadness. The driving force of the effect in this scene is the performance of Matti Pellonpaa. \nMatti Pellonpaa skilful soliloquy of sadness made me forget that he was an actor because everything simply happened to genuinely. He simply said his lines as if they were on his mind, not as if he had to think about them and learn them. The true strength in his monologue is a powerful thing and is full of powerful emotions, so it is difficult not to walk away from the final scene in Night in Hearth having felt the saddening effect of a poor man's suffering attempts to become a father, and Matti Pellonpaa's lead performance in the role is flawless.\nAnd the film ends on the same note it started on, with a Tom Waits musical piece.\n\nSo Night on Earth has some hits and misses depending on how the audience appreciates one vignette over the next, but the strength of the actors and Jim Jarmusch's iconic style is all too real in Night on Earth.",

As a Helsinki native I found the acting in the Helsinki section a bit too soap opera-like (one actor is overacting and another underacting) and the language not to sound like a Helsinki dialect, but I guess it's a bit harder for Jarmusch to direct when he probably doesn't understand the language. That however will probably not bother people who don't speak the language either. I also found it funny how the cab seemed to teleport around town, especially when first driving next to old wooden houses in some more remote part of town, then turning a corner and being next to a 7-storey building downtown. I'm sure this happened in the other cities too.",

            "content": "**** out of ****\r\n\r\nJim Jarmusch understands human beings. The way I see it, he has lived out his life observing them; forever fascinated by the things they say, the ways in which they move, and how they think. A born filmmaker; he brings his general interest in mankind to the screen with much passion. It's what he's been doing since \"Stranger Than Paradise\" and \"Mystery Train\"; and it's what he's doing in \"Night on Earth\" - which is one of my personal favorites from the director. It's an anthology film told in five acts; each one bearing both differences and similarities in both setting and characters (they all take place in taxi cabs and depict the relationship/bond shared between driver and passenger). This is not much unlike \"Mystery Train\"; which only took about three separate anthology pieces to tell the story - but at least it doesn't feel as if Jarmusch is filling his vision to the top with ideas that he can't properly execute. He has one main focus and his grasp is - to say the least - rather tight.\r\n\r\nPart one of five - the driver is Corky (Winona Ryder), the passenger is Hollywood executive Victoria Snelling (Gena Rowlands), and the city is Los Angeles. When the journey begins, it is the evening; the taxi ride goes well into the night. Since there isn't much to do in a cab (unless you've got a cellular phone, like Victoria does *shocker*); the two women decide to engage in some prolonged, thoughtful chats. Initially off-put by Corky's tomboyish and often times unfiltered - vulgar - attitude; Victoria soon learns to appreciate the youngster, and once they arrive at their destination, Jarmusch finds it the perfect moment for an honest, all too human end-of-the-road dialogue exchange between these two characters; and for the night, it shall be their last.\r\n\r\nThe city is now New York. A determined black man - whose name is revealed to be \"Yo Yo\" (Giancarlo Esposito) - calls for just a single cab to pick him up, even when the city that never sleeps happens to be filled with them. Not one will pick him up; it's most likely a racial thing, in this instance. But then, one taxi pulls over and the driver - an older man with the peculiar name of Helmut Grokenberger (Armin Mueller-Stahl) - offers Yo Yo a lift. He accepts, but then considers declining the offer any further when he discovers the position of his driver; an immigrant from Slovakia with little experience as a taxi driver and much more as a clown in his homeland. Like the first unlikely two taxi-occupants, these two get increasingly bored over time and find solace in each-other through conversation. And as can be expected from Jarmusch - a talented and inspired storyteller - the dialogue is engaging.\r\n\r\nSmack dab in the middle we've got Paris, France. We open on the driver (Isaach De Bankole) - who goes unnamed - as he is harassed by two businessmen, and think of it, in the comfort of his own cab! He kicks them out, leaves them in the streets, and looks for new business; ultimately finding it in a blind woman (Beatrice Dalle), with whom he would much like to swap personal life philosophies. But she's a tough cookie; and it isn't going to be particularly easy to reach her. The driver - who is from the Ivory Coast - will find that the racial gap between the two is larger and far more significant than initially predicted.\r\n\r\nNext to last, we end up in Rome, Italy. From the clocks that are shown between each individual segment (and in the beginning of the film), we learn that it is early morning. The cab driver in the fourth part of the story is Gino (Roberto Benigni). He spends his nights and early mornings having lonely - but very funny - conversations with the two-way radio; in which he describes disturbing - but again, quite amusing - sexual fantasies. After his first attempt at this, he finally finds himself a customer; a priest (Paolo Bonacelli). Things just get even weirder than they already were once the priest steps into the cab; as Gino decides this would be a good time to confess his sins to the holy man - some of which include sexual encounters with pumpkins and sheep, and a romantic affair with his brother's wife. His description of such things proves too much for the priest; in the end leaving the driver in a sticky situation.\r\n\r\nFinally, we arrive in Helsinki; where taxi driver Mika (Matt Pellonpaa) feels as desolate and alone as any cab driver working the late night shift; that is until he assigns himself to picking up three good ol' boys. And while one of them is far from OK mentally or physically, they're still, well, good ol' boys. You see, the one who isn't quite right has just had the worst day of his life; he lost his job, his car, his wife, and his daughter is pregnant. It would seem that his buddies tried to aid him and ultimately drowned their collective sorrows in alcohol; which, as we can see, lead to not much of anything at all. However, in telling their friend's sad story; Mika decides to share his own, which is melancholic on a whole new level - but at the same time, entirely heartfelt. \r\n\r\nI've said too much about each fifth that makes up the film's plot; I just couldn't help myself. Now you know all that you NEED to know if you plan on watching this film; which is, in my opinion, a triumph in the understanding of human nature. The dialogue is rich and very...real. The situation are believable and often times, they have some sort of payoff which comes in both the emotional and intellectual variety. As with the best films from writer-director Jarmusch; \"Night on Earth\" has a philosophy and a purpose, both of which run deep in spite of the lack of a \"moral message\". But...must all films have one? I don't think so; of course, a pointless film is needless, but one that is good on its own without a distraction of message-making is just fine by me. For fans of Jarmusch, this one pulls very few punches; it's what you'd expect from one of modern independent cinema's pioneers. You will either find each segment intoxicating and involving or slow and plodding. But that is, ultimately, where the beauty is at.",

The brunette is quite attractive, disability or no.\n\n4. Rome - The funniest segment by far, Benigni talked about some of the most disgusting thing's that I just did not want to hear.. and the \"padre's\" reaction's were spot on perfect! No wonder the padre, the poor bastard, had a heart attack, or something... The death scene was completely unrealistic, tho. Seeing his face move, his eye's popping back open, I kept expecting, after the driver left, the padre to look around, chuckle and then mumble to himself that although he had to listen to that idiot ramble at least he didn't have to pay for the fare and he got a free pair of sunglasses, too. \n\n5. Helsinki - Depressing!\n\n\nAlthough this is a film that is a character driven story, there were wasn't much character development; not enough of it at least to drive the story the way that a character driven story should be.

            "content": "NIGHT ON EARTH (1991), the fourth film by American auteur Jim Jarmusch, is a series of vignettes centered around taxi journeys in the US and Europe over a single winter night. There is no overarching plot, but rather each segment is a study in interaction between the driver and his fare.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Winona Ryder is a 16 year-old tomboy taxi driver and Gena Rowland is a Hollywood casting agent. In New York, Armin Mueller-Stahl is an immigrant from East Germany who gets a crash course on American culture after he takes Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez to Brooklyn. Crossing the Atlantic, we first go to Paris where Isaac de Bankole, an Ivorian immigrant who faces the challenge of racism daily, picks up blind woman B\u00e9atrice Dalle who could care less what colour his skin is.\n\nThe last two segments are less about class or race and more humorous and individual. In Rome, Roberto Benigni finds an opportunity to confess a long list of sins after he picks up priest Paolo Bonacelli. This is a hilarious scene, the best part of the film. In Helsinki, Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4 brings three drunks home (Kari V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen, Sakari Kuosmanen, and Tomi Salmela), but after they bemoan their misfortune, he tells them what real suffering is. \n\nFor the most part, this is one of Jarmusch's weakest films. There is that inconsistency between the study of power hierarchies and the straight-up comedy. The Paris segment is nothing but cliches about how the blind might not see, but their other senses are more powerful than the sighted. The New York and Helsinki segments are hommages to Jarmusch's peers Spike Lee and Aki Kaurismaki respectively, using their settings and borrowing some of their actors. While the New York scene has Jarmusch's characteristic humour, Jarmusch's style is almost completely effaced in the Helsinki scene and one could believe he's watching a Kaurismaki film.\n\nBut oddly, I still feel compelled to give this film a universal recommendation, as the Benigni scene is great. Here the Italian actor is at his best with his trademark rhetoric and -- suprisingly, considering he's behind a steering wheel the whole time -- his skills at physical comedy.",
