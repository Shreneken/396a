    "summary": "The monstrous Penguin (Danny DeVito), who lives in the sewers beneath Gotham, joins up with wicked shock-headed businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) to topple the Batman (Michael Keaton) once and for all. But when Shreck's timid assistant, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), finds out, and Shreck tries to kill her, she is transformed into the sexy Catwoman. She teams up with the Penguin and Shreck to destroy Batman, but sparks fly unexpectedly when she confronts the caped crusader.",

            "content": "Not as good as Burton's first outing, but still strong. The aesthetic and score are again on point, with a worthwhile investment in more sets and locations. Walken, Pfeiffer and DeVito all seem like good choices for their roles, delivering some believable menace in their Burtonesque reimagining of their characters. Batman Returns suffers from a mild case of too-many-character-itis... but nothing as bad as, say, Spider-Man 3. The weakest and most distracting part of the movie is an attempt to introduce sexual dialogue / content. Maybe they were trying to make a nod to the double entendres of the 60's show, but it just came off as tacky. The jokes weren't funny and making Penguin a sex fiend didn't enhance him as a villain. It just made me think I ought to remember not to show this one to kids.",

The cast delivers solid performances, with Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman stealing the show. However, the plot is convoluted and the pacing can be uneven at times, making it feel like there are too many subplots competing for attention. Additionally, some of the more fantastical elements may not be to everyone's taste. Overall, while it may not be the strongest entry in the Batman franchise, it is still a worthwhile watch for fans of the character and those who enjoy Tim Burton's unique aesthetic.",

Acting, acting in original DC movie is always perfect. CGI for the time the CGI was perfect. Villain, I didn't like the Penguin I really hated the Penguin and I think it's mostly because he wasn't as evil as Joker and he wasn't as well written IDK it's just something I think but I do like the penguin's pets. Writing, the writing for most of the film is good but for some scene I think it could have been better. Story/Plot I think that both could have been better. Casting, I think that the casting is great. Characters, although I didn't like the villain I liked Batman, Catwoman, and Alfred. Mystery, the mystery I think the mystery was better in the 1st movie. Ending I liked the ending I think that the ending should have lead to a \"Batman lll\" with Riddler as the villain and Batman, and Catwoman should have fought side by side and maybe Boy Wonder/Robin should have been introduced.",

Danny DeVito was the best thing to happen to this movie, and even though his script is fucking idiotic, he makes it work by giving an utterly ridiculous performance. The rest of the cast is kinda forgettable, even Michelle Pfeiffer, with melodramatic scripts that only feel like a parody some of the time.\n\nThe story itself is dumb, period.

For one to say that Batman Returns was disappointing, he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of Danny Devito as the Penguin. Devito and Walken offer some memorable moments. The tale of Batman is suppose to be dark and Tim Burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays Batman. Batman Returns provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and it should not be viewed as 'crap', although we are all entitled to our own opinions.",

Michael Keaten is suitably brooding as the Dark Knight, better than George Clooney in Batman and Robin (considered as the worst out the franchise)though he is overshadowed by the villains, namely Danny DeVito as the Penguin, who looked as though he was having a ball, and brought a sense of sadness and grotesquesness to the role. Christopher Walken was effective also as Max Schrek. Stealing the show, with her flawless delivery of not-so special lines, is Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy and manipulative Catwoman. The film looks lovely, with the sets and effects, and Tim Burton directs with detail. However the film does drag, and while there are some intelligent lines from the villains, the script could have been developed a little more. All in all, a dark and entertaining film. Whereas Batman Forever is funnier and more fast paced, Batman Returns is darker, but just lacks the sophistication of the first film. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

Michelle Pfeiffer gave an almost direct comic iteration of The Catwoman and whiel she did well at what she was trying to carry out, I do enjoy the mroe recent anti hero Catwomans more. The plot was also well stacked.

While I enjoy a good Tim Burton movie as much as the next film critic/filmmaker but at times (especially in this movie) Burton tends to lean towards the bizarre of his style of writing. This is still a good Batman movie and among the best of Tim Burton's films, however in comparison to Batman (1989) it kind of drops the torch here and there. This movie has a bit of an uneven tone, at times it's dark and gritty then it can be bizarre and campy.

There is a bit of that here, as certain story beats are fundamentally baked into this genre. But Burton managed to lean even MORE into his precious gothic aesthetic, so much so that it would be his last time helming a Dark Knight tale. He also pushed the limits of PG-13 for its time, with some dark subject matter splashed with kinky touches. The production design is baroque but stylish. Daniel Waters peppers the script with mordant wit (he also wrote 'Heathers'). Danny Elfman's delicious score adds to the film's devilish glee and the actors--Keaton, DeVito, Pfeiffer, and Walken--are all well-suited for this creation from that great gothic visionary Burton. A bit slow at times, a little long, but it's often entertaining",

Christopher Walken was effective also as Max Schrek. Stealing the show, with her flawless delivery of not-so special lines, is Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy and manipulative Catwoman. The film looks lovely, with the sets and effects, and Tim Burton directs with detail. However the film does drag, and while there are some intelligent lines from the villains, the script could have been developed a little more. All in all, a dark and entertaining film. Whereas Batman Forever is funnier and more fast paced, Batman Returns is darker, but just lacks the sophistication of the first film. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

This is only accompanied by iconic performances from Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer, bringing flair and a sense of tragedy to their roles. Although this film is brighter than the first, the film continues the lack of definition from its title character. Through lacking a clear reason as to why he fights crime and the lack of what defines him as a hero, Batman's greatest aspects of being a hero are lost in translation. This film does improve upon the first with its artistic liberties and brilliant performances, but lacks in the most important aspects of its main character which makes the viewing experience at times feel empty.",

Batman Returns is the sequel to the 1989 classic, Batman, which once again is directed by Tim Burton and this time stars Michael Keaton. It co-stars Danny Devito as Oswald Cobblepot aka The Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. This time Batman has to face The Penguin who has plans to eliminate all of the first born children of Gotham, while also dealing with a Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walkin), a corrupt businessman who allies himself with the Penguin in order to bring Gotham to his very control, and Catwoman who seeks revenge against Shreck. \n\nDid that sound like a lot? Good, because this movie is a mess to sit through. On one hand it is great to see Keaton once again as the caped crusader and Tim Burton's production design is out of this world. I love the visuals and the Penguin's design is definitely the most unique design I've seen of the character no thanks to VFX legend Stan Winston.\n\nOn the OTHER hand, I am aware that the character is known to being dark and edgy. I mean LOOK AT HIM, he's got a long flowing black cape that's shaped like a bat and operates AT NIGHT, I GET IT. Yet, why is this movie so dark to the point where it is TOO dark. When it is overdone, then it fails to make the common folk take this character seriously. Like I kind of took it seriously a little bit in the first movie, but this movie took that seriousness and tossed out the window in favor of this absurd dark comedy that is just TOO dark, even for a Batman fan like me. \n\nDoes that make this a BAD movie? No, it is not a bad movie. It has everything you need for a Batman movie: action, suspense, romance, an awesome soundtrack, etc. However, it does lend itself to less Batman-like experience and more akin to that of Tim Burton himself. If you view this as a typical Burton movie, it's great, but as a Batman movie, then NO, it could've been WAY better.",

In terms of sharing similarities with it: the film delivered another bold performance from Michael Keaton as the eponymous character. The film, however, is strengthened by its villains and the brilliant actors who dawn them. Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer have an incredible chemistry and dynamic with Keaton's Batman, particularly the latter, who I argue is the standout of the film. Pfeiffer played a villain who was misunderstood, burdened and outcasted by society, but still morally present, and ultimately assists the Dark Knight in cleansing Gotham of its latest threat. Furthermore, the movie adds elements of politics that differentiate it from its predecessor, with themes of corruption and manipulation governing the actions of the films antagonists, DeVito and the brilliant Christopher Walken. Sure the film was darker than its predecessor, but such tone choices never bothered me.",

Where Batman Returns (1992) aims to return to the dark tone of its predecessor, there are certain aspects which feel way too ridiculous to include, mainly the origin of Penguin and Catwoman.\n\nThe tone isn't as focused as Batman (1989), there are many inconsistencies which I'm sure don't affect the overall quality if you can look past them, but if bothered it doesn't match the enjoyment of the original.",

Okay, the acting isn't exactly terrible either, but it's hardly very good, and it really says something to the movie's overall quality when this is the ONLY time Danny DeVito turns in a bad performance!  Much of this can be blamed on a script that is just dour, needlessly aggressive, artificially edgy, and worst of all, completely uncreative and uninteresting.  The writing of this movie is nothing but cheap moments playing on shock-value, strung together by D-level characters and dialogue.  Now, fused with Tim Burton's obsession with trying to make everything look as unsettling and unpleasant as possible (which works with movies like Beetlejuice) just makes this a woefully unpleasant movie.  I remember thinking it was somewhat poor when I saw it as a kid in theaters, and revisiting it in my mid-30s, I found it to be just as unpleasant as I recall, but EVEN DUMBER than I remember!  Many people claim Saw invented the Torture-Porn genre, but this movie feels a lot more like the genesis of this niche - Batman Returns features moments of people's faces being cut-up, people being bludgeoned and run over, lots of victims screaming in pain and terror, and murder is wholesale.  This is especially the case with Cat Woman, arguably the single biggest sadistic and sociopathic character in the movie (heck, maybe the ENTIRE superhero genre!), and this is made worse by the fact that we're supposed to connect with her.  Now, unlike some movies that I harp on in regards to this, I will give this movie credit:  It does actually give her a recently-occurred tragic backstory that does make her slightly sympathetic, but when she's using her claws to tear people's faces literally apart....yeah, you kinda lose it.  If you like Edgy-For-The-Sake-Of-It entertainment, I suppose you might like this movie, but honestly, its both turgid and uncreative - the Shopping Mall equivalent to Gothic-Action cinema.",

While I enjoy a good Tim Burton movie as much as the next film critic/filmmaker but at times (especially in this movie) Burton tends to lean towards the bizarre of his style of writing. This is still a good Batman movie and among the best of Tim Burton's films, however in comparison to Batman (1989) it kind of drops the torch here and there. This movie has a bit of an uneven tone, at times it's dark and gritty then it can be bizarre and campy.

It feels like she throne out of a building every 5 second. After receiving her \"powers\" she become a totally different character, and loses every sense of who she was. The only thing keeping the two versions of Selina Kyle together in this movie is the same actress otherwise the arch of her changing is just too quick.

Like a comic book, certain elements like quick character development and a huge suspension of disbelief (a man who is part penguin that no one ever heard of runs for mayor??) are required. But as a viewer I accepted the premise that Burton’s Gotham is not a parallel for a modern city quite like Nolan’s Gotham. Burton instead paints a beautifully dark, fictional city which intersects at times with the political, particularly with Cat Woman, but generally steers clear of the heavier themes Nolan tackles with his trilogy a dozen or so years later. Burton opened the door for the comic book genre in movies. And though many films that follow better develop an emotional and political arc, Batman Returns remains an aesthetically incredible film and very easy to watch. ",

The first movie also suffered from this same fate. The one major problem with the movie: everyone is trying to get with everyone! I'm fine with the crappy one-liners or the cat puns, but there's so many sexual innuendos that it just threw me off.

            "content": "A brooding take on Batman.\n\nTim Burton's Gothic noir Batman Returns (1992) remains one of the greatest films involving the caped crusader. Batman is enshrouded by shadows, silhouettes, and smoke with Burton's dark direction. Burton clearly loves the strange and unusual as you can see all his love for freaks and film in Batman Returns. Tim Burton brings his strong voice and original vision to Batman Returns for a phenomenal display of directorial prowess. Everything feels intentional and exact in this perfect movie.\n\nMichael Keaton plays Bruce Wayne as a serious, isolated man desperate for love and awkward in his encounters with ladies. He is so realistic and likable as Bruce and stoic in his gravitas as Batman. Keaton really gave Batman Returns his all at conveying Bruce's loneliness with genuine subtle heart.\n\nLikewise, Michelle Pfeiffer makes Selina Kyle lovable as an unloved woman, who hates her secretary job, and is miserable living alone. Her sensitive performance as the meek Selina Kyle that makes you feel pity on this belittled working girl only accents and elevates her resplendent portrayal of Catwoman as a sensual mistress of chaos. Her feline purrs and whip cracks are just excellent choices for Catwoman's characterization alongside her rigorous physical combat and flawless feminine movements as the midnight alley cat. She's effortless in her fluid motions in that skintight catsuit and killer stiletto heels. I love Michelle Pfeiffer's visceral stares with her icy, pale blue eyes the most about her unforgettable role in Batman Returns. She should have gotten an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress here or even Best Lead Actress, honestly with how much screen time Tim Burton gives her.\n\nDanny DeVito is amazing as the sympathetic deformed Batman villain The Penguin in his unholy appearance of rotund mass and drool covered character. DeVito has never acted with more heart and passion as his legendary incarnation of Oswald Cobblepot. Christopher Walken is exquisitely entertaining as Max Shreck. Michael Gough is still likable as the older Alfred Pennyworth with all his adoration for Bruce Wayne and desires for his master to find love.\n\nBatman Returns is beautifully shot by Stefan Czapsky with his moody cinematography covering grim wide shots and haunting close-ups of each Batman character. Tim Burton really outdid himself with this ethereal film further diving into the dreamy universe of Gotham with Bo Welch's bleak production design and Danny Elfman's chilling score. Elfman's music is synonymous with Tim Burton's films for good reason as his whimsical Goth opera soundscapes blanket Burton's pictures with an aural sense of wonder. Batman Returns is enchanting as it is horrifying.\n\nDaniel Waters and Wesley Strick's writing is empathetic towards lonely men, cast off children, deformed people, and ill-treated women. It is a fantastic script full of innuendo and mystique that will deliver delight to adults and children alike. Chris Lebenzon and Bob Badami's editing is slick with a confidence that lets Batman fly and investigate with complete awareness of time. Batman Returns is a very brisk 126 minutes and feels half that length.\n\nRick Heinrick's art direction looks like Tim Burton's dreams come to live with carnivals, zoos, and city streets all splashed with the same alternative hue so unique to Tim Burton's movies. Tim Burton really is an auteur with an original aesthetic and emotional tone to his features.\n\nFurthermore, I have to hand it to Ve Neill and Michael Key's make-up department. Batman looks mysterious and powerful, Penguin looks grotesque and vile in all his filthy sewer grime, and Catwoman looks ghostly white in her pale face and dark eyeliner that brings out Michelle Pfeiffer's heavenly translucent blue eyes. They really killed the make-up providing that Tim Burton flourish of pale and ghastly. \n\nBob Ringwood and Mary E. Vogt's costume design is second to none for Batman Returns. Batman's cowl and suit is more ominous and realistic compared to Tim Burton's 1989 Batman picture, while their Penguin costume for Danny DeVito is hideous and perfectly unsightly. I must mention their iconic Catwoman latex suit for Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and alluring as it fits her curves and slender figure, while accenting her character's handmade feel with the messy stitches. Michelle Pfeiffer has never looked so lovely as when she portrayed Catwoman in Batman Returns.\n\nIn conclusion, Batman Returns is peak Burton mastering his filmmaking craft with unimpeded directorial vision. He got to strap rockets to real penguins! How can you not love this film?",

This film did seem odd having it set at Christmas time. I felt like that aspect did not play much of a part. I feel like the aspect that worked for me was Catwoman acting as Catwoman. The other thing that worked for me was seeing the origins of Penguin and trying to find his family and trying to find where he belongs when he has been rejected by society for so long due to a birth defect in the fingers. I think what did not work for me was How grows they made Penguin with the black lips. I felt like that was overkill. It also did not seem logical that Penguin would bite someone’s nose and no one do anything without any consequences against Penguins. I could not see that one. The origins of Penguin did not work for me. I did love how the Batmobile was used in this film. The ships and cadges by both Batman, Penguin and Catwoman worked for me. I think that this film showed a better dynamic of Alfred and Bruce Wayne than the 1989 Batman film. The aspect that did not work for me was Christopher Walkin’s Character. He felt like he was in a much more serious film and was almost more dangerous than Penguin was. Catwoman was actually a good protagonist. But her origins as Catwoman being thrown out a skyscraper window and then coming back to life were so far fetched that I had trouble believing in the origins. I liked the opening credits to this film making us feel sympathy for Penguin as a character. I liked how the action and Batman moved in this film. Towards the end the explosions went a bit over the top and unbelievable. I found Penguin, Catwoman & Christopher Walkin’s ending a bit over the top and unbelievable. ",

Michelle Phifer bring out good vibes playing Catwoman, you can tell she was really invested into playing this role of Selina Kyle and she really wanted to succeed, and in the end, she came out successful. Danny DeVito also played Penguin great, I have to be honest, I have never been a fan of Penguin but the make up artist and Danny himself did such a good job, you can tell Danny was also really invested into playing this role, you can tell he read a lot of Batman comics and just overall did a lot of studying to play the Penguin. Oh, and Michael Keaton also does a really good job at playing Batman again, even though I think that his performance wasn't as good as his performance in the original. I feel that the writers could have improved the story a bit more. I felt the story was lacking and definitely wasn't as strong as the first Batman film, I just felt the writers were feeling a little lazy with this one and maybe a little too over their heads. Finally, Tim Burton was going for the dark vibes again just like the first one, and he succeeded with doing that, He didn't make this film as dark as the first, but it's still a pretty dark film which I like very much.

Throw in a heavily-costumed Danny DeVito, overacting his heart out as a creepy, deformed, sewer-dwelling foil and Christopher Walken, doing his most wild-eyed, exaggerated Christopher Walken impression, and you've got... a mystifying ensemble, to say the least. Elsewhere, Michelle Pfeiffer turns in the film's most memorable performance as an unhinged secretary-turned-feline and leading man Michael Keaton once again plays a supporting role in his own movie, greatly troubled by all the unbridled insanity unfolding around him.\n\nIn many ways, Batman Returns goes out of its way to distance itself from its predecessor, while still trying to ape the bleak atmosphere and sheer quotability of the original. Those tricks don't work half as well this time, feeling more like a forced obligation than a natural eccentricity. Maybe the writing team lost its spark, or maybe DeVito, Pfeiffer and Keaton can't put as much sheen on a silly line as Jack Nicholson could. Whatever the cause, this one underperforms. Mesmerizing for all the weirdness, amusing for its litany of quirks, but a little too out-there and nonsensical for its own good.",

The film was directed by Tim Burton who if you didn't know already is one of my personal favourite directors of all time. The film stars Michael Keaton as Batman, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman and Danny DeVito as The Penguin.\n\nThe story I felt was split in to two, one about Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle's relationship, and the other about Penguin and his rise to the top. Penguins story was in my opinion the stronger and more darker story, from the misery to his grand plan, but that's not to say that Bruce Wayne and Selina's story was bad. I felt that they were both portrayed very well, but I did feel that the pacing for the film would slow every time it cut back to Bruce and Selina.\n\nThe acting was mostly very strong especially Danny DeVito as The Penguin, I felt that he gave a really good performance and fit the character incredibly well. The only problem I had with the acting was that a couple of the extras did feel like they were either trying to hard or just not trying hard enough. \n\nThe characters were also very strong especially Penguin, I felt that Tim Burton's take on the character was very unique and was done extremely well. The only character that was mixed for me was Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, but luckily her high points were higher highs then her lower lows.\n\nThe cinematography was also strong, with some really good shots of the characters and sets.\n\nThe set designs and props were in my opinion one of the strongest aspects of the film, especially with the zoo and Gotham city.\n\nThe costume designs and makeup were also very good, especially with Penguin's makeup and suit.\n\nThe film also had a very strong and unique style, from the colour scheme to Tim Burton's take on the characters.\n\nThe practical effects were very strong especially some of the stunt work, but I do have to say that some of the special effects did look a little off especially a certain batarang scene.\n\nThe action for the most part was very good and entertaining especially the final fight scene, but there was one fight scene in particular that felt a little underwhelming compered to the rest of them.\n\nThe soundtrack like the first film I really liked and think fits with the films atmosphere and tone incredibly well.\n\nThe atmosphere at points was also really strong, especially around The Penguin in the first and third act.\n\nThe film I also really enjoyed and I hope to watch it again very soon.\n\nI do have some complaints with the film like where's Vicki Vale and some direction choices, but the film also has some great scenes that really stand out to me.\n\nOver all I give it a\n7/10\n75%\n3.75/5\n\nNot as good as the first, but still very strong ",

Batman Returns takes place after the events of Batman (1989) with the setting turned to Gotham City during Christmas time. A deformed crazed man named the Penguin (Danny Devito) has arisen from the sewers of Gotham and with the help of powerful business man Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) makes a bid to take control of Gotham. Meanwhile, another mysterious figure going by the name Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) crosses paths with both Penguin and the Batman (Michael Keaton). It's up to Batman to stop Penguin, expose him for the fraud he is and also figure out who the mysterious Catwoman is! This movie is dark! I mean that in a good way. While the first film was a grounded story this one definitely has much more of that traditional Tim Burton Gothicesque style to it. I love the set pieces here and we really get a good background on the Penguin. Yes it gets absolutely ridiculous at times (Penguins strapped with rockets and he's literally riding a duck at one point), but it adds to the charm here. Keaton is so great as Batman I really wish they could have gotten him to cap end the trilogy here. This is the version of Catwoman I always think of as well and Pfeiffer does the best she can here. I found her parts the corniest of them all and for the most part it didn't age as well, but this movies all about your identity and what it means to you and for the most part she nails that narrative.

And similar to it, the writers are basically shooting in dark, with banal sequences and characteristics- that may or may not work- they are moving with an incredible pace to reach in an also rushed climax. It is big mix bag. It has flaws, it is off putting at times, but then it is also entertaining and smart where it touches few unexpected mature notes, basically the heart is in the right place, no matter where the craft resides. And among many characters, the most avant-garde and unstable is Pfeiffer's Catwoman.\n\nInfamous for her role in this film throughout her career, one can easily spot where the audience go berserk over her performance, it fluctuates frequently from being exceptionally good to eerily questionable. I would blame writers for installing not-so-practical acts on her basket and other multiple odd gatherings and chalky conversations. Still her range of melting down within a snap and then regain power with a maniacal laughter ought to be eye popping. The technical department, obviously, feels short handed since it doesn't hold up with time; the make-up design is really fine though.\n\nDeVito does carry on the passed torch by Nicholson, with a creative and vivid body language that does most of the performance for him and with some good monologues and speeches, he manages to safely board the train. Keaton has always been the weakest link on the franchise, he may ooze the charisma of a billionaire but on terms of merit, there is a long way to go for him. Batman Returns but only for fans, with few awe inducing moments and brilliant supporting cast, the franchise is still gullible in Burton's overly decorative world.",

I think the more dark and gritty take on Batman was needed. Tim Burton really brought Batman down to earth and grounded the story in realism whilst also having a lot of camp. Although there were a lot of creepy/scary moments in the movie, I still find it to be a very fun movie to watch around the holiday season. I highly recommend Batman Returns. It is my second favorite Batman film behind “The Dark Knight Rises”. This movie is a lot bigger and better than the first.

He's one of the best to portray the caped crusader, doing well as both the hero and the man behind it. Danny DeVito (Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin) was a bit of perfect casting. He not only looked the part, but was equal parts menacing and gross. I'm not holding back when I said it was perfect. Christopher Walken (Max Shreck) was also a highlight, snice he's great in basically everything. Max comes across as the true villain, since Baman, Penguin, and Catwoman/Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) are all in the position they're in because of Max or people like him. It's something I enjoyed throughout. The dark tone fits Batman and the specific villains chosen this time around. That's kind of Tim Burton's bread and butter, so he was a good choice to remain at the helm of the sequel. Keaton and Pfeiffer have strong chemistry, especially when just playing Wayne and Kyle.\n\nWeaknesses: Effort was put into the origin stories of Penguin and Catwoman, but neither really shined through. Penguin's was better, but Kyle's stuff lacked. She was pathetic and survived attempted murder. All of a sudden, she puts on a suit and knows how to fight, be stealthy, etc. There's not a big, layered plot. It's basically just a plot to frame Batman and not much else. Though it's kind of expected in a superhero flick from the late 80s/early 90s, a lot of the acting is cheesy. Pfeiffer especially gets some corny lines.\n\nOverall: While no performance quite matches up to Jack Nicholson's in the original, the work of Keaton, DeVito, Pfeiffer, and Walken make for a strong cast. The dark tone works and the action scenes are solid. They took risks with the sequel and most paid off.",

I am not a human being I am an cold blooded animal! Crank the AC! Where are my lists? it’s time! these are the names of the first born sons of Gotham. Just like I was.

We will snatch them and Carry them in to the sewer, and toss them into a deep, dark watery grave. “Penguin? “ Henchmen said, “I mean isn’t that a little uh...” Penguin growled and shot the Henchmen with his umbrella and said “no it’s a lot.” Then Penguin kicks his dead body into the sewer water.

I don't think they could've cast a more perfect actor. I love how there's real life penguins just hanging out on the set, swimming around just chilling. \n\nThe explanation of why she became cat woman is kind of obscure, but I guess she had a sudden realization of how pathetic she was living her life and decided to make a very drastic change. \n\nChristopher Walken is well, Christopher Walken. He's always great. Michelle Pfieffer is brilliant and fierce as cat woman. Even though the director's style is not as obvious and prevalent, it's definitely got the tim Burton feel to it which I love, lighthearted, funny, and doesn't take itself too seriously. \n\nVery creative and original ideas in this Batman movie. Wow, it really took a turn for the dark toward the end. We get to see everyone's true colors. Cat woman's, Penguins, Batman's, even Walken's character. It was very much like a comic book. \n\nIt's weird and I know I'll be judged, but I very much liked this one more than the first Batman. All of the characters are so interesting with complex and fucked up backstories. It seems like there's more character depth in this one.",

It couldn't have hurt. Once you get Danny DeVito spewing black shiat from his mouth while making crude sexual jokes and standing around in his soiled underwear, and Michelle Pfeiffer offering perhaps the most excruciatingly cliche Catwoman performance ever put to film (with dialogue that would have made Julie Newmar groan at the banal level of pussy-related puns), you might as well have Eddie Murphy just reprise his Axel Foley character for a comedic take on Robin.\n\nIf I never see Batman Returns  again, it will be too soon.

Heck, this was before the internet was around for us to google it. They tried to make the next Batman movie after this one more fun but it was empty and shallow (except for the always-awesome Jim Carrey as the Riddler).  This one has depth. This movie is art. The follow-up is a billboard.\nI must admit, though, I like the first half better than the second. It all gets sorta loud and obnoxious, and the focus on mood and atmosphere gets overshadowed by endless and kind of bizarre action sequences. I have this problem with action/fight sequences in general. It's hard to top the ingenuity of early 80s Indiana Jones. I find more exciting action sequences that are non-traditional--for example, Joan Cusack's race to get the news segment tape to the machine in Broadcast News.

Danny Divito had potential as the Penguin, however Burton made him a little too gruesome, so much that this version of the Penguin could have been in a horror film.  However, maybe it's somewhat part of this movies charm to have more horrific Batman film, and although I do love the ghoulish presence this film takes, I still can't get passed how nauseating the Penguin was which wasn't really Divitos fault, but more of a writing and costume problem.

Batman Returns should be great, it has some fantastic elements here but unfortunately this is a very mediocre film. All of the acting is superb; Michael Keaton is still brilliant as Batman and is to this day the best Batman, even though Batman doesn't feel a lot like Batman here, Keaton is still great. Danny DeVito is perfect casting for the Penguin and he's great here. Penguin is a great, creepy and disgusting villain and DeVito is obviously loving playing him. Michelle Pfeiffer is great as Catwoman, she's very sexually driven but she's very cool and a really good character. Christopher Walken really does just play himself but he's still great as Walken is in everything. Tim Burton here I don't really think did a very good job at directing, this film less like a Batman film and more like a weird mash of goofy Burton characters and weird imagery. Everything else about this film is very hit and miss. The action is okay, the fight between Catwoman and Batman is good but the rest of the action is underwhelming and the finale of this film is poor. This film also went dark which could have worked but unlike in every other Batman film there's no fun and makes this quite a hard film to watch. Also while this film is about the same length of the first Batman film this movie just drags and is quite boring. Technically though this film is brilliant with great cinematography and lighting. The editing isn't the best and the script is very padded and could've done with another look over. The Danny Elfman score is still great here and it's great to hear throughout the film. Overall Batman Returns has some good elements but this is a boring and difficult to watch film with all over the place direction. Brilliant villains aside there's little to remember about Batman Returns. C+",

If Batman was a comic book movie directed by Tim Burton, then Batman Returns is a Tim Burton movie about a comic book character. Lured back by Warner Brothers after the mega-success of the first go-round, the auteur boasts more control on this follow-up, which makes the Caped Crusader a supporting character in the director's own dark carnival. \n\nIn Burton's PG-13-rated sequel to Batman, a corrupt businessman (Christopher Walken) and the grotesque Penguin plot to take control of Gotham City, only Batman (Keaton) can stop them, while the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) has her own agenda. \n\nWhile some of Batman seems cartoonish, much of Batman Returns is purposely cartoonish. Still, there's no denying the entertainment value of this funtastic spectacle. While watching his indelible vision of The Penguin and Catwoman as performed by DeVito and Pfeiffer, you feel Keaton falling further into the shadows, but Burton's takes us through the looking glass into to a shadow-steeped character-filled Wonderland long before he intends on tackling Lewis Carroll.\n\nBottom line: Dynamic Do-Over",

            "content": "In theory, I should love 'Batman Returns.' As a stickler for all things gothic, Tim Burton and Batman, from an outside perspective everything about this sequel should satisfy my appetites. And yet, after numerous re-watches over the years, each time trying to convince myself that I should love it more than the last, I still don't. Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that the reason I don't love it is because it simply doesn't work, either as a Tim Burton movie or as a Batman movie, and in retrospect it's a crying shame that the picture didn't work out the way its director probably envisioned. \n\nI should clarify that although I'm not a fan of his stylistically obsessed Batman movies, I am a great admirer of Tim Burton and his works. Over the years he's been involved in the creation of some of my favourite movies, including his modern fairytale masterpiece 'Edward Scissorhands' (released just two years prior), and later the likes of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', 'Ed Wood' and 'Sleepy Hollow.' There's no denying his considerable creative talent and ability as a filmmaker, but when it comes to Batman, Burton either lacks interest in the source material, or in this case, seems far more interested in creating a wacky Tim Burton movie than a live action adaptation of Batman's universe. 'Batman Returns' is, for all intents and purposes, a Burton movie that just happens to utilise characters from Batman's universe. \n\nA sequel to the rather generic 1989 original, one thing that can be said for 'Batman Returns' is that it at least has a little more flare than before. Whereas 'Batman' was by most accounts a very standard superhero flick that was fortunate enough to feature an atmospheric setting and a stunning soundtrack, one thing 'Batman Returns' isn't short on is personality. Just a glimpse at a single shot will immediately tell you that this is the result of Burton's overexcited mind, and with a little more guidance, this could have been something truly special. But while watching this I could almost imagine a young Tim Burton behind the camera, staging a shot whilst shouting lines like \"Look, Mom! I'm making a Batman movie!\" I did, in fact, just accuse a movie of having too much personality, which Burton has clearly demonstrated is possible. Maybe I'm nitpicking here, but the point I'm trying to articulate is that the movie just feels wrong, tonally speaking. Its gothic, yes, but in looks only. Its actual flavour is that of a deranged carnival, casually staging inappropriately gruesome violence against a goofy backdrop that strikes me as a bad parody of Gotham City. Following the commercial success of 'Batman' I fear that Tim Burton's overactive imagination ultimately got the better of him, resulting in a movie in which the director's creative vision outweighs the respect for the source material, and the result is frustrating. \n\nDespite being a sequel, the movie is a completely self-contained experience, barely even acknowledging the events of the first movie beyond a self-conscious quip about Alfred knowingly letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave (a cause of controversy for years among Batman fans.) I sense that Burton had several gripes against his own movie, and 'Returns' is a sort of effort to wipe the slate clean and present his own unaltered vision of Batman's universe. Unfortunately it's a mess. This was the first superhero movie to properly introduce the concept of multiple villains by including Christopher Walken's corporate baddie Max Schreck (presumably named after the actor), Danny DeVito's grotesquely deformed version of the Penguin, and lastly Michelle Pfeiffer's devastatingly sexy portrayal of Catwoman. Quite why these three were chosen is as perplexing and random as the rest of the movie, and none of these characters even work in the slightest. \n\nIn a manner that bares resemblance to 'Edward Scissorhands' the movie introduces us to a interpretation of the Penguin born with hideous deformities, before being thrown in a river by his rich but equally repulsive parents. Raised in the sewers by penguins (this keeps getting stranger and not in a good way) Oswald Cobblepot (the character's real name) later seeks vengeance against Max Schreck and his dastardly corporate schemes that involved pouring toxic waste into the sewers (or something akin). After revealing his existence to the world in a deliberately staged act, Cobblepot is eventually elected mayor in a bizarre turn of events, and it's here where the movie really loses its way. Why is this hideous hobo who bleeds black ooze and eats raw fish suddenly in a position of political power, you may ask? Because Mr. Schreck is a man of great influence, and the movie demands a villain in a position of power. I'm in favour of reinventions, but this version of the Penguin is almost unrecognisable when compared to his comic book counterpart. Traditionally portrayed as a stunted, albeit suave and sophisticated nightclub owner, the Penguin was actually one of Batman's more ordinary foes, if you'd be so generous to use that term. This Penguin is as disgusting and implausible as anything I've ever seen, and although the perfectly cast Danny DeVito does a stellar job at bringing the monster to life, I simply cannot abide this version of the Penguin. \n\nSimilarly overcooked is Selina Kyle/Catwoman, who is barely saved by the talents of Michelle Pfeiffer, but remains equally as absurd and needlessly fantastical as her chubby accomplice. In the comics Selina Kyle had traditionally been depicted as a poverty-stricken orphan who worked as a prostitute in her younger years, only to later don a cat suit and become a cat burglar in order to make some extra cash. What has always made Batman's rogues so compelling is that most of them, like Batman, don't posses any superpowers, and usually rely on their intellects and individual talents to terrorise Gotham. The Joker didn't have clown powers and so it seems similarly preposterous to bestow Catwoman with cat powers, but that's exactly what the movie does anyway (the screenplay was written by Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters, so Burton can't get all the blame.) After an 'accident' involving a fall off a multi-storey building, awkward and insecure secretary Selina Kyle is miraculously resurrected by a hoard of mangy street cats who chew on her fingers until she returns to life, in what appears to be a bad parody of Edgar Allan Poe. Following her resurrection at the hands of magical cats, Selina suddenly undergoes a drastic personality change, becoming ultra confident and donning a skin-tight latex suit before inhabiting the persona of Catwoman, an antihero/cat burglar with (literally) nine lives. Its absurdities are an unwelcome abundance, and after numerous flirtations with the Batman and cheating death on multiple occasions, it does beg the question: what's the point? While its undoubtedly fun watching Michelle Pfeiffer ham things up to the maximum and spending the remainder of the movie as a horny wreck, there doesn't seem to be much purpose, a sentiment that can be transferred to the movie as a whole. \n\nPerhaps the reason I haven't even mentioned the Batman or Bruce Wayne until this point is because I genuinely forgot about his presence in the movie. The Dark Knight shows up often enough, but just like in the first movie, he lacks any sort of distinguished screen presence. It's not a generational problem; Michael Keaton is just very bland as both Bats and his alter ego, and once again the movie never delves into any sort of depth regarding his character. Not even Alfred is given a fair shot, with Michael Gough's reprisal practically reduced to a mere series of fleeting cameos. But the most unforgivable crime the movie commits? Batman kills people, regularly and willingly, and apparently, without any sort of remorse (he even smiles at one point before allowing a henchman to be blown to kingdom come.) Did the screenwriters even bother to research this character, because they appear to have missed the entire point of the character: namely, he never kills. In fact, the whole point of Batman is that he is character haunted by death who commits his entire life to trying to prevent it, and by so carelessly ignoring this imperative character trait, 'Batman Returns' has sealed its own fate as a poor imitation of Batman and his universe. \n\nMore positively, 'Returns' boasts the same qualities as its predecessor in the respect that the soundtrack and visuals are equally stunning. With a Christmas-themed pallet covering Gotham in a winter wonderland-like appearance, and Danny Elfman channeling some heavy 'Edward Scissorhands' vibes there's no mistaking Burton's fingerprints permeating everything. It's beautiful to look at, and if anything, every shot should be framed and admired in a museum. But that doesn't mean the images work when strung together as a motion picture. Add in Christopher Walken as a third addition to the villain cogs, and what we're left with is little more than a Tim Burton Christmassy nightmare masquerading as a Batman movie.  I appreciate that Burton and company tried to be innovative and different, and the film at least gets the tone (relatively) right, but I am unable to consider either of the director's ventures into Batman's universe to be anything more than an experimental if misguided attempt at bringing the character to life, and the style-over-substance approach is just too distracting to warrant any kind of sympathy.",

Michael Keaton gives a more controlled work as Batman, but I don't think that it's great in any way. Burton's film fails to do justice to the Caped hero and mostly because the film shows him as a man behind a mask, not a human being, whenever he is off the mask, he is girlfriend hunting.

It has a special side to it, and is in my opinion and impact to the Batman film universe.\nWith the great production design that I enjoyed in the first film, things begin to go downhill near the beginning of the movie. We are introduced with the odd story of Oswald Cobblepot, The Penguin. It's basically the infant Oswald eating a cat, being overlooked by his upset and disturbed parents, aka, Pee Wee Herman and a blonde lady. \nThe Penguin's story plays a major role in the film. The upsetting part is, we can't dig deep into it with all of the characters that are thrown into our arms. Selina Kyle is relevant, and played well by Michelle Pfeiffer. Then, Christopher Walken and his goons are thrown into the mix, then interfering with Penguin's present day issues, literally and figuratively. \nNot only do the characters annoy me, I can't help but mention that the brooding and eerie tone to the movie almost kind of ruins the experience. I would do anything for just a glance of a blue sky. Heck, I would've even killed off Batman for it. The whole film is basically black, and disturbing. Not a spooky disturbing. A disturbing that honestly is pointless. Babies being eaten, faces being cat-scratched, Penguin making sexual jokes, and an army of live, killer penguins.\nBeing a Batman fan, I didn't like it.

Selina Kyle, enraged by her boss' attempt to murder her and by the repressive male-led Gotham, becomes Catwoman and embarks on a ferocious crusade that soon makes her clash against Batman. There's a crepuscolar feeling of loneliness and defeat surrounding the Caped Crusader: he basically fights alone to save an indifferent city, while his foes somehow try to vent their frustrations on him. In this depressing setting, the most innovative and striking element that permeates the whole movie is the level of perverse eroticism shown. In an very tense sequence, Catwoman first has a harsh fight with Batman, then she tries to seduce him by sensually exploring his armor with her clawed hand, strongly suggesting him that a form of fetishistic sex is occurring - but in this cynical universe, this \"dream\" will have painful consequences.

I mean, I know that she was at a very low point in life but still. She turned into Catwoman by getting pushed out a window and having cats lick her wounds? I mean I guess, I never tried it so I wouldn't know. I liked how most things in the movie werent totally ridiculous. For the most part, made sense and was mostly reasonable.

The Dark Knight may be my favorite movie of all time, but Batman Returns still feels like the definitive Batman movie, as well as Tim Burton's best movie.\n\nEveryone is perfectly cast, the villains are the real stars. Danny DeVito's version of Penguin is nasty, corrupt and downright murderous. In fact, this Penguin is so scary, no one else has played the character in over 20 years! Michelle Pfieffer's Catwoman is also unbeatable. She's seductive and crazy, and a more villainous Catwoman than any other on screen portrayal.\n\nThe story is actually really dark, especially for it's time (which is probably why we have movies like Batman Forever and Batman & Robin). Penguin's plot to kill all the first born sons of Gotham is only side tracked by Christopher Walken (played by Christopher Walken) and his plans of corrupt politics, but his original plans remain his main goal one way or another.\n\nThis is actually my second my second favorite Batman movie. Michael Keaton kills it in this, pretty much everyone does, the movie has a dark tone and atmosphere worthy of a Batman movie, and this proves that you don't need the Joker to have a terrific Batman movie.\n\n9.5/10",

            "content": "For Keaton's second outing as the billionaire playboy turned winged vigilante, we see a much lighter touch applied to the character. As Tim Burton's original Batman moved away from the camp craziness of the 60's TV show, Batman Returns takes a small step back. With overly elaborate methods of beaming the bat signal into Wayne Manor, and secret entrances to the bat cave that open via a switch hidden in a fish tank. I was half expecting Bruce to ask Alfred (Michael Gough) for his bat-pipe and bat-slippers!\n\nBatman is also hardly in this film, because this movie is more interested in telling the origin stories for the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Cat Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer), while also introducing Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), a wealthy business mogul looking to control Gotham's energy supply. Which for me, represents the film's main weakness, while simultaneously providing a good reason to see it.\n\nWith three villains and two plots for Batman to foil, this story is bloated, but at the same time it supplies us with three great performances from its A-List cast. Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as Gotham's feline love interest for the caped crusader, and Danny DeVito is superb as the vile, yet tragic character, Penguin. Christopher Walken is also properly intimidating as Shreck, yet shows a real knack for comic timing.\n\nVisually, this film clearly has Burton's stamp on it, even more so than the last movie. Set during the Christmas holiday, Returns is more snow-covered red and white candy canes, than Gotham's usual gloomy grays and blacks. This film is also a lot more theatrical, and Gotham seems smaller as most of the action takes place in the city's central plaza. Even after including a few wide shots of the city skyline, the film never shakes that studio set feel and look. The fake looking foamy snow another obvious nod to the theatrics, rather than the celluloid. Which may have been Burton's plan all along, but in my opinion, this approach with the cast and production design, was a step in the wrong direction.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis movie has a lighter tone than Burton's first Batman film, and includes more humor. In many ways, this installment was the precursor for the disastrous Batman Forever and Batman & Robin films. The movie is rated PG-13 for some violent content.\n\nBest Format:\n\nGotham feels a lot smaller in this installment of the franchise, but it's still got all the great visual elements you'd expect in a Tim Burton movie. If your local theater was screening this, I would recommend you watch this on the big screen. At home, a HD viewing on a nice big TV and sound system is the best way to enjoy this film's visuals and Danny Elfman's great score.\n\nBest Moment:>\n\nI loved the moment Batman, Penguin and Cat Woman meet for the first time. As Selina Kyle somersaults into the shot, stops, and then calmly says 'meow' as the department store behind her explodes! Great moment!\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/batman-returns-1992/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "I bought the 4pack Blu Ray that had all of the 4 early Batman movies (not counting the TV movie). So this is the second rewatch from that batch. I hadn't seen these in years, but I remember not really liking the original much, but really liking Batman Returns. \n\nWell, my memory was right. This is a MUCH better movie than the first Batman. \n\nThis is much more of a unique, uncompromising vision of a film. The first one was obviously a Burton movie done commercially, with a bunch of studio hacks who didn't think story mattered and didn't want to take too many risks. This was different. This was a BURTON interpretation of Batman, not a Batman movie done by Burton. \n\nSo, of course, the movie is impossibly weird. It's very different from the \"real world\" Batman of the Nolan films and much more a pure fantasy. But that's the beauty of it. It has an odd combination of Blade Runner and a saturday morning cartoon feel to the atmosphere. It has a dripping teeth Penguin character that fits in to the whole person/animal thing that they play with the whole movie, it has penguins launching rockets, duck transportation, aquatic birds doing a funeral precession, human eating cats, etc. But unlike the original Batman, the atmosphere draws you in, as weird as it is, and you feel like you've entered this other world. \n\nWhile the plot is still relatively weak, unlike the Nolan Batman movies later, it's still stronger than the original Batman. More important, the characters are exceptionally strong. You really feel the psychological struggles of Bruce/Batman, Selina/Catwoman and Oswald/Penguin, at least in an odd Burton way. You want them to solve their psychological hang ups. The fact that you know they want just makes it feel all the more tragic. \n\nAt least for me, I found the doomed love story between Bruce and Selina to be very moving. It just got to me in this odd fantasy world way. I'll be the first to admit that I think when I first saw this around age 11, seeing Michelle Pfeiffer dressed in leather gave me feelings I didn't really understand at the time. So maybe that influenced it. But I really think it had a Romeo and Juliet \"doomed love story\" feel to it. You know they can never work, but the impossibility of the circumstances and their own hangups make you WANT these twisted, lonely souls to find a way to overcome it. I remember desperately wanting the final scene, seeing Catwoman still alive, to be carried on in the next movie. I remember being crushed that it wasn't. \n\nOf course, there are things I didn't like. They go a bit too far with Penguin, his raw fish eating/nose biting/black teeth was too over the top and not that fun to watch at times. And I think they could have cut back a little on some of the more overt cartoonish elements. But overall, this movie is the only one of the pre-Nolan Batman films that I really think is worthwhile. It's a true visionary work of an auteur near the peak of his powers and with the success of the first movie cutting him loose from the studio. However flawed it may be, it's a compelling vision. One of Burton's best and a truly unique movie.",

            "content": "And just like that the Batman series of movies that began with \"Batman\" in 1989 declined into the mess that would remain until Christopher Nolan redeemed the character in his own trilogy of movies. \"Batman Returns\" is a fairy tale that ignores Batman for much of its first hour. Instead, an element of magic is introduced into the franchise that I personally couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept. We have a Penguin who has somehow tamed and uplifted penguins to do his bidding, and we have a Catwoman who is brought back to life by cats nibbling on her fingertips.\n\nTheir origin stories aside, the movie is missing any particular throughlines or themes. What begins as a mystery about Penguin's original plan is sidetracked by his run for mayor, and when he returns to his plan the rationale is disappointing. Catwoman is bent on revenge, but she starts to become a put-upon punchline, an element that works against the plot's faint inkling of women's liberation.\n\nChristopher Walken as Max Schreck is really just Christopher Walken with fun hair, but then again, he is almost always himself in movies. There is humor in his son sounding just like him. Schreck is mostly around, however, to enable the Penguin to come to the surface, or to be kidnapped.\n\nApparently critics and audiences love this movie, and even more so than the first one. I saw the movie once in the theater and not again until many years later, and it bugged me in exactly the same way. Batman is a character that works as straight up action adventure, gritty realism, film noir, dark gothic, horror, and camp. \"Batman Returns\", for me, does not successfully bridge Burton's dark fairy tale vision for its villains and Batman himself, who remains much more grounded even if it is in a hyper-reality sort of way.",

            "content": "Nobody does Gothic better than Tim Burton, and his return to the Batman franchise is superior in almost every way to his first effort as well as being a hair's breadth behind the newest entry.\n\nWhat makes the Batman films stand out (discounting Forever and Robin) is their dark nature which is as much about the inner conflict of both hero and villain. Keaton's Batman is different to Bale's; like him he is split, troubled and somewhat empty inside-the old wounds of his parents' death have not healed, and he finds it almost impossible to reconcile the two sides of his life. Unlike Bale's spoilt, tempremental, tantrum-figure, however, Keaton brings a more mature, calmer character, albeit with a deal of wit. The effect is to gain our sympathy and empathy for his dilemma in a tribute to Keaton's talent. Likewise, DeVito is quite excellent as the sadistic, destructive but again remarkably witty Penguin, and is suitably frightening and disgusting to boot. He's not quite as good as Jack Nicholson's Joker, but it's a very impressive effort. Perhaps the real gem is the brilliantly electric Pfeiffer, who totally brings Catwoman's duality to life and again gains our empathy. In particular at moments in Bruce Wayne and Selina's (her true name) interplay where Keaton flags, Pfeiffer shows a depth of ability that sustains her for the entire film and is vastly superior to Kim Basinger's lacklustre performance in Batman. Walken provides a further nemesis for Wayne that is understandably priceless.\n\nOne must not forget the many other elements that make this film; Burton's superb direction features a whole array of wonderfully dark shots of the city lit by twinkling lights which keeps the sinister atmosphere intact. The moody tone is of course interspersed with some great fight scenes that show a significant improvement of special effects from the original as well as giving the characters a good deal of more gadgets and weapons.\n\nIt's not really close to the comics, but the script is cutting-edge, the acting almost perfect and the result is an exciting, often moving, film with the sentimentality of other superhero efforts kept down and an ending that is most satisfying.",

She becomes 'Catwoman'. Penguin is a hideously-deformed and eerie looking person who comes from a rich family in Gotham.  The films focuses more on Batman, unlike the first film which was a little more focused on the joker. Nevertheless, the first film was still great. This one, Bat,an Returns, is superbly directed yet again from Gothic-loving master- Tim Burton. It has intense scenes, dark, thrilling scenes and genius acting from all three (Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer).

As for the freak, have THAT guy be Killer Croc, who comes out of the sewers, pretends to save the baby, and have him get a job with Penguin as his body guard. And have Catwoman still team up with him, tricking the audience into thinking she forgave him for \"killing\" her (but Cobblepot doesn't know who she is), then, after Batman reveals the truth about Oswald Cobblepot to the world, have Croc, upset that the world won't accept him, kidnap Penguin and take him into the sewers, while Catwoman follows them and confronts Penguin, and have her kill him during the climax, and reveal that that was her plan the whole time. Meanwhile, Batman fights Croc, who accidentally falls down a large drop into the lower levels; he comes u, tries to kill Batman, fails, the dies. That would have been great. But none-the less, I still loved Michal Keaton as Batman and am glad that Batman had a larger role in this movie, and I wish he could have reprized his roll in the next one. 5/10",

The cherry on top is that the whole film takes place at Christmas time. The world design is fantastic as usual, but darker (as is the film). This sequel is the rare film to really get just  how fucked up Batman really is (He's literally a man divided, and he's just as crazy as the villains he fights), which is also why the relationship between Catwoman and Batman works and makes sense. She really is the closest thing to a soul mate he is likely to find. Batman Returns is a daring, brave,very sexual, ultra-dark, and twisted film.

Billy Dee Williams does not become Two Face\n20. Batman has pretty much already one before the third act. The rest is just tying up loose ends\n21.

Someone is bound to find penguins in the sewer.\n25. Zoo never noticed that their penguins play around in toxic waste\n26. Bruce Wayne does not recognize Kyle's voice when she is out of costume\n27. Batman does nothing except brood\n28. Somehow people are willing to vote for the Penguin to be Mayor despite the fact that he has no qualifications\n29.

Tim Burton hates Christmas\n32. Getting shot does not equal dying. Catwoman still has plenty of lives left\n33. The alliance between Walken and the Penguin makes no sense\n34. Throwing your secretary off of your building is a stupid way to kill someone. Someone will notice that.\n35. Building blows up but is all fixed in a few minutes\n36. Why would you bite someone's nose if you are running for mayor?\n37. Kyle knows that Bruce is Batman. She's going to rat him out.\n38. Helicopter umbrellas would not work.

Penguin is nothing like in the comics, the polite and planned demeanor replaced with a crude, grotesque sewer-dweller. Catwoman (Selena Kyle) is created a very sad and tragic character. With both, the actors hit the bar PERFECTLY. As far as Tim Burton wanted the characters to go, you probably could not find better picks for the characters. On other subjects, I think Michael Keaton kind of dropped the ball here. His performance is still good, just not as good as it was in the first movie. And above it all... this movie is just weird. If you don't get my meaning, think this: Penguins with rockets tied to their backs try to destroy Gotham, Selena Kyle is pushed out of a very high building but survives because a bunch of CATS crowd around her, and Penguin almost bites a publicist's nose off. Does this make the movie bad? Actually, no. The morbid strangeness of it is actually quite captivating. For that reason, it remains a macabre, bittersweet counterpart to the first movie.",

            "content": "Now this was more like it! As for what I wanted from Burton's first Batman, this sequel is a lot closer to it. The film feels a lot more like a 'Tim Burton' film and a lot of the problems from Batman, have been eliminated or fixed such as booting the Vale and Knox characters and having a more consistently sinister villain and a far livelier and sexier leading lady... and no Prince music to date the film like last time... And for the record, I think Prince is a musical genius and has some great tunes but, they don't belong in a Batman movie. The story is still not the strongest... none of this era's Batman movies had strong plots... but, it makes up for it by strengthening a lot of other weaknesses including a more gothic look and a snowy Christmas setting with a bit more of a devious sense of humor. We start out with the wealthy Cobblepot family (Pee Wee's Big Adventure vets Paul Reubens and Diane Salinger) welcoming a new baby boy into their family... an unfortunately deformed baby whom they proceed to send a la Moses sailing off down a creek in a basket. The basket sails into the abandoned Gotham City Zoo and down into the sewers beneath where it is greeted by a group of penguins apparently left over from the zoo's closure. Cut to over three decades later as Gotham is battling a new criminal element and there are urban legends of a 'penguin man' stalking the sewers of the city, and now that he's established as a hero, the apparently useless Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) calls upon the Batman (Michael Keaton) to combat these problems. Meanwhile unscrupulous businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is scheming to construct a power plant that will actually steal power from Gotham and is forced to throw his shy secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pheiffer) out a high rise window when she stumbles on his plans. But, all these characters and stories are destined to clash as the criminal gang is actually run by The Penguin (Danny DeVito) who is the vengeful, deformed outcast son of the Cobblepots and he tasks Max Shreck to help him get his revenge on the city that abandoned him. Miss Kyle is resurrected, in a scene that evokes the Japanese horror flick Kuroneko (1968), by the touch of some stray cats and emerges as Catwoman, yet another vengeance seeking individual with chaos and bedlam on her mind. And the one thing they all have in common... none of their plans can come to fruition without the elimination of The Batman. The only hitch is that Batman and Catwoman may have found soul mates in each other just as the emotionally scarred Bruce Wayne has with the equally damaged Selina Kyle. But, will the feline femme fatale side with the caped crusader or join the other villains to do him in? Burton may not be the strongest storyteller but, he does far better guiding this one then the last. Maybe it was less interference from prodcers?... a less demanding actor as his lead bad guy?... or that Daniel Waters' script is a vast improvement over that last film's. Either way this flick is a lot more fun, while retaining it's dark tone. It seems to move faster and despite it's complicated story and numerous characters, seems to flow a lot better in the context of the telling of that story. The characters all seem to fit together better, especially Keaton and Pfeiffer whose scenes together both as Wayne and Kyle and their alter egos are a delight to watch and crackle with a sexual tension that was completely absent in the last film's romantic pairing. They are also far better written and have some nice crisp dialogue between the two especially with Batman and Catwoman's love/hate relationship. While it may be debated that Walken's villain is one too many, his scenes with all three leads are amusing to watch as he basically seems to be playing everyone for his own benefit and also seems quite amused with himself that his partners in crime don't see the wool pulled over their eyes or his thinly veiled contempt for them as he does it. Keaton is even better here as Batman/Bruce Wayne and seems to be more relaxed in the role and while he is still a wounded soul, I dare say his Batman here is enjoying his superhero role a little more now that his is out of the shadows and an outright hero instead of an outlaw. He works well with all the cast especially recreating the magic between Batman and butler with Gough's wonderful Alfred. As for DeVito, his Penguin is a grotesque and sinister creature that instills discomfort and menace. He is having a blast with the role and is far more consistent with his portrayal then the all over the place performance Nicholson gave and this helps establish his character more solidly. Penguin may not be as quite iconic as The Joker but, in my opinion DeVito is far more successful in his portrayal then Jack was in his because, he picks a tone for the demented and sly Oswald Cobblepot and stays with it. It may also help that he has a better script and a director who is not having his script changed underneath him like last time. Pfeiffer is simply hot and spicy as the kitten with a whip that is her Catwoman. She is adorable as the shy and clumsy Selena Kyle and then is delightfully hot as the twisted and sexy villainess. She and Keaton have a wonderful chemistry together and make good use of the witty dialogue between them. She also has some fun scenes with DeVito, whose creepily horny Penguin would like nothing better than to get into her vinyl catsuit. The production on a whole seems more relaxed. The budget is almost twice what the first film's was and Burton goes with a more gothic look with less pipes and girders and more stone and castle-like architecture and the colors are less rust and rot with more blues and cool grays to accent his cold weather suited villain. The first film looked appropriately grungy but, here it more 'Transylvanian' and he makes good use of the snowy winter setting to present a beautiful snow swept city in contrast to the dirty dark sewers in which Penguin calls home. There are some fun action scenes too and the film benefits from a larger budget with better FX and model work. Even back in the day, some of the model work in the first film's cathedral scene made me wince. Danny Elfman returns to once again composes a wonderfully fitting score. The two Batman scores are among his best work. All in all, Batman Returns is a better film in every way and it's a shame the studio decided to change direction in the next film and go with Schumacher who treated the next two Batman films like a gaudy burlesque show complete with bat nipples and gratuitous latex covered ass shots. Keaton sadly but, wisely walked away as the next two films went from neon drenched car wreck to neon drenched train wreck respectively. Odd that the studios wanted the films to be lighter and more family friendly yet, Schumacher gave them far more of a kinky sexual subtext then the darker Burton films.",

            "content": "A return to Batman wasn't something Tim Burton wanted to do after the mixed feelings he felt when he made the first Batman. That is until Daniel Waters's script (the guy who wrote Heathers) impressed him enough to go ahead and do a sequel. The biggest difference here from the first Batman is the tone. It's so much more darker and even more complex in terms of the two villains that Batman must defeat. This time around he has to battle with the likes of The Penguin and Catwoman. There's an interesting subplot between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle that really becomes the movie's core center. It's the first time where we get to see Batman really fall hard for Catwoman. The love story between the two was fascinating because she represents Bruce's struggle with duality and that they both are the same on every level. Except for her she couldn't live with herself long enough to enjoy being with him. It would be a curse on her part and not fair to him. Also you have to remember she didn't ask to be pushed out of a window from a high rise building only to then return from the dead as a \"friendly\" feline.\n\nMuch of this sequel deals with the dirty dealings of Max Shreck who forms a bond with The Penguin. The Penguin's circus gang has been disturbing Gotham City during the holiday season and through a specific act of heroism The Penguin re-emerges from the sewer from once he dwelled to search for his parents. His parents gave him up a long time ago by tossing him into the sewer after discovering his deformity. Ever since he's been down there he's been raised by penguins and plotting the day for his return. Suspicion rises on Batman's part who sees this Penguin as someone who is up to no good. Jealousy is subtly played between Batman and The Penguin. That was interesting to see. However Batman is right (of course) and The Penguin's diabolical plan of actually running the City of Gotham as mayor becomes a terrifying thought.\n\nSome of this sequel's biggest highlights are the set designs and the many scenes on the rooftops where much of the fighting takes place. The chemistry between Catwoman and Batman is purrfect. Michelle Pfeiffer gives a great performance as Catwoman and should have gotten an Oscar Nomination! Danny Devito as The Penguin was another great casting choice. Michael Keaton returns as the cape crusader and Christopher Walken makes an appearance as the insidious Max Shreck.\n\nAs far as sequels go in the Batman series, this one literally outdoes the first one.",

Returns is an improvement in several areas over its predecessor. Michael Keaton is given more moments to shine as both Bruce Wayne and Batman and his character feels more fleshed out in this film. Danny DeVito is delightfully crazy as the Penguin and has some great moments where you sympathise with his character and Christopher Walken, as always, is great fun to watch as a villain created specifically for this film. Michelle Pfeiffer really steals the show here however as Catwoman, capturing the moral ambiguity and psychological fragility of the character and acting as both a great for and quasi-love interest for Batman. Burton's usual gothic direction is also more evident in this than in the first film, with Danny Elfman's score utilising whimsical and dark tones which are often a trademark in his films. I also love the ending to this film, it's very bittersweet and has a nice melancholy touch to it that was lacking in the previous film's climax. My only problem with the film is that it does feel like its dragging in places but besides that, this is close to being a classic and one of Burton's most underappreciated. If any Batman film comes close to equalling the Nolan trilogy, Batman Returns is it.",

Batman Returns had a lot live up to being that its predecessor was just so unique in ever regard and for Tim Burton to take everything that excelled in Batman, transfer it over to Batman Returns and then manage to make the sequel even better than the first is nothing short of remarkable! Batman Returns was the first Batman movie I watched, I was 3 when I first viewed it so watching the film now 17 years later brings with it a level of utter nostalgia and fond memories. Burton's gothic and dark storytelling is back and more impressive than ever and it's beautifully balanced with another fantastic and evocative score from Danny Elfman. It's an enticing and grand Gotham City that's been created and I'd love to visit and love to live there and I think that's the biggest compliment I could possibly give set designer Bo Welch. Michael Keaton is back and he brings an even more brooding Dark Knight to the table along with stellar performances from DeVito's Penguin, Pfeiffer's Catwoman and Walken's Shreck; every character helps ground the Dark Knight in this fantastical yet realistic world that they inhabit, they all play to each others strengths and weaknesses and it just works! \nTim Burton first gave us the most influential Batman movie, and then he followed up by giving us in my personal opinion the best Batman movie. Batman Returns is an unforgettable triumph.",

The film has some good performances in the film, including Michael Keaton whenever he is on screen (which is unfortunately not a lot). \n\nSome characters are absurdly random. Notably, the penguin. \nHere is a list of all (or the majority) of The Penguins motivations throughout the film: \n-\twants to learn who his parents are\n-\tWants to blackmail Businessman\n-\tWants to be elected mayor\n-\tWants to get Batman\n-\tWants Catwoman\n-\tWants to kill every first born son in Gotham\n-\tWants to kill Gothamites via Suicide Bomber penguins. \n-\tDies\nConsistent?\nMy main problem with Batman Returns is that it is needlessly depressing, vulgar, bittersweet. Because of the random plot and characters, this dark and depressing tone is not justified. However there are good things in the movie. The relationship between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle is developed. I don't really like this interpretation of Catwoman (with the exception of the romance between Bruce and Selina) because of how random her character gets at times. Also, one Great Quality in the movie is Christopher Walken. He is both at times hilarious and menacing. If nothing else, watch Christopher Walken in the film. \n\nGrade: Not Good at all *\nNumerical Grade: 3\nLetter Grade: D+\n\nOverall opinion: This movie is needlessly depressing, random, vulgar and leaves you depressed and somewhat cheated. Definitely one of the weakest Batman movies. \n\n* except Christopher Walken, Michael Keaton and Selina/Bruce Romance, sadly not enough to save it.",

            "content": "Batman Returns is perhaps the most visually striking Batman film. Tim Burton's strongest point as a filmmaker is his visual flair, and it strongly permeates this movie, right down to character design. The Penguin, played absolutely foul to perfection by Danny DeVito, has several schemes to HATCH, and with the help of corrupt businessman Max Schreck, who himself has made an enemy of Catwoman, proves a formidable foe. Michael Keaton is Batman, and portrays a stoic, silently brooding figure. This Batman is a restrained take on the character, and the stiff costume notwithstanding, is in a way better than Nolan's for simply lacking that appalling Bale voice. Oddly, for about an hour of the movie Batman is almost a nonentity. Herein lies one of the flaws. Like several Batman films, there simply is not enough focus on Batman. A troubling amount of time is taken by Catwoman, and I'll be frank: I find Catwoman's presence in this movie entirely pointless. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the role with much more charisma than Anne Hathaway, but on the whole even what works (such as the early apartment scenes with those great 'for women' commercials) just distracts from the plot that matters. Plus, the whole nine lives thing is mildly retarded. And the romance is a tad inexplicable, and if anything it shows how pathetic and lonely Keaton-Wayne is. But what really works in this movie: Holy shit, the Penguin. I can only imagine how repulsed many a viewer half-expecting a quacking Meredith-esque hamfest must have been to see this completely disgusting, bile-spewing, sex-hungry, grotesquely fat and deformed interpretation. DeVito plays possibly the only Penguin that could work in a serious film who isn't just a fat, eloquent crime boss. Another reason Catwoman doesn't work is quite simply because it'd be better if all the focus were on Penguin. Max Schreck is a similarly fine villain, although he is kind of stupid at the end for shooting Batman, who wants to save him. Now, another thing is that this Batman is very unevenly badass. Sometimes he'll be outsmarting Penguin, others he'll be somehow failing to capture members of Penguin's circus, and other times he just lets people die, and Batman does NOT do that. Some somewhat inexplicable things occur to move the plot forward, such as Schreck happening to stand on just the right sewer label or Penguin getting chased by the cops simply for a scandalous speech. So while the narrative may not be tight (down to the meh climax that focuses on Catwoman and Schreck as opposed to the Penguin), the performances and the visuals really make this movie, leading to an entertaining experience that could have used some editing.",

Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy darker films, especially with Batman's character, but you have to have a justifiable reason for including those dark elements. Most of the time, it seems like this movie is just dark for the sake of being dark; so much so to the point where it's just plain creepy and weird at times. But this doesn't surprise me since Tim Burton is in the director's chair and he's just known for taking things and twisting them into something horrid and strange. The cast is good, especially Michael Keaton who once again is good as Batman, but yet again the villains tend to overshadow Keaton's Batman constantly just like Jack Nicholson's Joker did in the first film. Danny DeVito is surprisingly really good and unfortunately underrated as The Penguin, but strays away much from what the Penguin in the comics is like. Michelle Pfeiffer is good as Catwoman as well but her portrayal, like DeVito's, is completely inaccurate to the source material. All she really is some psychotic chick with nine lives and The Penguin is just some deformed psychopath wanting to kill a bunch of kids. Christopher Walken's character is pretty campy and over the top because he's pretty much playing himself but he's pretty entertaining nonetheless because it's Christopher Walken and he manages to entertain in every role he plays, no matter how good or bad. Taking this movie as it is, it's not bad but as a comic book film, it fails because it's not true to its predecessor or the source material. This is, plainly and simply, a Tim Burton film, no questions asked. Only reason Burton decided to stick around to do this one is because he was given complete creative freedom, and the proof is all unmistakably there. If you're a Burton fan, chances are you'll quite enjoy this film. But if you're a Batman fan, don't go into this film thinking it's a Batman film. Instead, think of it as a Tim Burton film featuring Batman, otherwise you'll be sadly disappointed.",

Penguin ultimately fails in his plots then dies, Catwoman appears to die but because she may mystically have 9 lives, she later appears alive at the end of the movie.  \n\nPersonally, I feel the movie moved back and forth between dramatic and dark to comic or absurd and back.  The Penguin and Devito's playing of him are my least favorite things about this film and I wish that Catwoman with Michelle Pfeiffer in the role had been a larger part of the film and perhaps returned in the sequels that followed.

We begin with an establishing shot of the Cobblepot house, coupled with whines of a newborn baby, and a disgusted couple deciding to abandon their baby for reasons revealed later. Fast forward 33 years, and we see a meeting of Max Shreck's (Christopher Walken) board prepping his legacy project: a power plant he wants Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) to fund. After listening in on the meeting, his secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) tries to make a suggestion before being sidelined for reasons that just come off as sexist. After that, we see her (literal) fall to madness, then from the sewers rises the Penguin (Danny DeVito), the baby that was abandoned to the sewers at the start of the movie. Instead of learning ninjutsu, he accepted himself as a monster, and becomes an eco-terrorist. Batman actually gets sidelined in favor of development of Penguin and Catwoman, and they are quite well developed: we see how Penguin becomes the bizarre creature he is from being abandoned by his parents for being different, and being raised by penguins, and we see how Catwoman goes from lonely secretary trying to make it in a man's world to the craziest crazy-cat-lady ever. There's still plenty of Batman, but he arrives later than he did last time. What also returns are the special effects that just look unforgivably fake. Some sets and costumes look cool, but the special effects were just unforgivably obvious in the fact they're fake. Danny Elfman also returns for the soundtrack, but not Prince. His score is as deep and memorable as ever. With a few laughs here and there, especially when you see Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle meet after having fought as Batman and Catwoman, Batman returns for another solo outing that would be the last good Batman movie for 13 years.",

He's just a gross, unpleasant character...and at no point, feels like a threat to Batman. You're never like, \"Oh no...it's the...Penguin.\" I think his intelligence should have been stressed more than his animalistic-ness. While I think Walken was amazing, his character more or less made Penguin a puppet. You never got a sense he could successfully do anything himself.

Christopher Walken provides an interesting and good secondary antagonist in the film.

Burton's penguin clearly has loose wiring but that is what makes this film psychologically rich. DeVito was masterfully casted as the Penguin. To this day, I cannot think of anyone who would suit that role better. As in the first film, I found the villain to greatly overshadow Batman. I just do not think Michael Keaton was a good selection to play Batman.\nAside from the Penguin, my favourite aspect of the film was the dark atmosphere  Burton created. Only Burton can effectively mix Halloween with Christmas and make it work. The overall look of the film was gorgeous with great costume design, makeup art and the use of dark colours on set. Danny Elfman also did an outstanding job composing the soundtrack for this film.\n\nEven if you are not a Batman fan, this is still a great film to see!",

Danny Devito is flawless as the penguin and Michelle is great as Catwoman!  Christopher Walken is great as a side villain. just like the first film it has a lot of flaws but a great and very interesting interpretation of Batman",

            "content": "Director Tim Burton brings us back into the dark,brooding atmosphere of Gotham City with Michael Keaton returning as the tormented hero known as the Batman, the flawless casting of Danny DeVito as the wicked and nightmare giving Penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy, delightfully dark, and fractured Catwoman and Christopher Walken as a self maniacal tyrant known as Max Shreck have given Batman Returns that rare honor of being a sequel that surpasses the original.\n\n Now I know I said Batman trumped all its sequels but I also said that the only obvious exception is Batman Returns. Well, I meant that Batman Returns topped Batman definetely. Tim Burton nearly makes Batman into a horror film with all this film's violence and gore. Danny DeVito as The Penguin is sure to induce nightmares, it did with me. He is a hideously deformed freak of the sewers. Penguin plots with evil businessman and tyrant Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) to become mayor and turn Gotham into a swarming city of crime. Upon overhearing this, clumsy secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is tossed out of a high rise window by her boss. Rescued by cats, Selena transforms  into the leather clad Catwoman. Although she teams with the Penguin and Shreck to overthrow Batman, she is in the fold for her own reasons and has some dark scores to settle. \n\nWow. What a film. Tim Burton weaves his dabbling in the horror film arts and mixes it in with some of his experience from making the original Batman to make a dominant sequel. It is your usual dark and unsettling Burton flick, but my God it is violent! From pulling a human hand out of a bag to sticking a tazer in somebody's mouth, its surprising this film even got a PG-13. But that's okay. Its Tim Burton, most of his flicks are violent. Maybe he was pushing the envelope and maybe he wasn't, I dunno. But despite the violence, it really is a great film. To me, Batman and Batman Returns stick out when I think of the original 4 Bat-flicks. I know Burton produced Batman Forever and Forever was much better than Batman and Robin, but Burton's Bat films are in a league all their own. I can't help but smile as I write this down because these two were so good. I can't help but crack a smile as I think about the multiple times I sat down on my couch and watched them.",

Max Shrek (Christopher Walken) is the best god damn thing about this whole movie. He may be the most underrated villain in Batman history. The afro-esque grey hair blow out. The snazy way he tossed Selina Kyle out the window. What is not to hate about this guy? Plus he has no allies. Batman? Screw you. The Penguin? Screw you? Cat woman? Screw you, out the window you go. This man had no allies. If it wasn't for that, there was some glaring plot holes that were covered up nicely by Tim Burton's ability to design the craziest visuals. Respect.

Danny De Vito is brilliantly cast as the Penguin, his performance fits the tone of the wrest of the film perfectly. Michelle Pfeiffer is great as Selina Kyle (Catwoman). She is one of my favourite characters of the Tim Burton Batman world and the presentation of the role works brilliantly. Christopher Walken is great as Max Shreck, his performance adds that extra bit of star quality. Danny Elfman's musical score is once again brilliant. The action and set pieces are bigger and better and this film holds its own as a great sequel. This and the original Batman film are timeless classics and parts of my childhood that I grew up watching. Personally the original is my favourite, but this is a great sequel and a great film.",
