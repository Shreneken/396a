The cinematography is incredible and edited phenomenally. This is a film that hits right out of the gate and never lets up from start to finish for the most part. There is some unneeded slow motion a handful of times but the editing is so masterful overall weaving the character backstory with the plot progression throughout it doesn't matter. The dialogue did personally start to get a bit too much right near the ending scene but the end made up for it. Intense, Vulgar, and Engaging the whole way is the best way to describe this. Everyone who is above 17 should give this a watch once.",

The cast is great and each actor gets their moment to shine, Michael Madson steals all the scenes he is in. The film is mostly done in long dialogue scenes, but the usual Tarantino violence is shown. I thought it would be better than what the film turned out to be but if you enjoy Tarantino's other films then this one should be enjoyable for you.",

            "content": "Reservoir Dogs is a 1992 crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. The film tells the story of a group of criminals who come together for a heist, but things quickly go wrong and the group begins to turn on each other. Reservoir Dogs was Tarantino's breakout film, and there are several reasons why it is considered a great movie.\n\nFirst, the film's script is a masterclass in dialogue. Tarantino's signature style of sharp, witty, and often profane dialogue is on full display in Reservoir Dogs. The characters' conversations are riveting and often tense, as they reveal the complexities and motivations behind their actions.\n\nSecond, the film's cast is outstanding. Reservoir Dogs features an ensemble cast of talented actors, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Steve Buscemi. Each actor delivers a memorable performance, bringing depth and complexity to their characters.\n\nThird, the film's nonlinear structure adds to its brilliance. Reservoir Dogs is not told in chronological order, with the story jumping back and forth in time. This adds to the tension and suspense of the film, as the audience is left guessing about what happened and what will happen next.\n\nFinally, the film's use of violence is both shocking and effective. The infamous \"ear scene\" is one of the most disturbing and memorable moments in cinema history, and the violence throughout the film is brutal and unrelenting. However, it is not gratuitous, but rather serves to heighten the tension and drama of the story.\n\nOverall, Reservoir Dogs is a great film and a true classic of the crime genre. Tarantino's expertly crafted script, outstanding cast, nonlinear structure, and effective use of violence all contribute to its brilliance. It remains a must-watch for fans of cinema, and a testament to Tarantino's talent as a filmmaker",

            "content": "Reservoir Dogs grabs you by the throat and digs its claws in deep. From the moment that the unwitting viewer tumbles into the realm of Lawrence Tierney's gang of eight, they are hopelessly trapped there until the final credits roll. As the first outing for actor/director/ writer Quentin Tarantino, this is a triumph, displaying all the marks of a longtime virtuoso of the genre.\n\nA jewelry store robbery has gone wrong - badly wrong - for the thieves. One member of the gang is dead, and several are missing. The survivors, including Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), and a critically-injured Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), are holed up in a warehouse, trying to figure out how to salvage the situation. Dissention and suspicion run high, as White and Pink discuss the possibility of a traitor in their midst, and the tension escalates when Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) shows up with a little surprise in the trunk of his car.\n\nThe cast, which includes Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen, is first-rate, and the parts the actors have to play are fully fleshed out. Tarantino invests each member of his group with a unique and multi-faceted personality. Not content with stereotypes, the writer/director digs deeper, bringing out the humanity in even someone as viciously sadistic and reprehensible as Mr. Blonde. To go along with the characters is a surprising plot, filled with wonderful little twists and turns, and pervaded throughout by the sense of not knowing what's around the corner. The non-chronological manner in which the story is told is confusing at first, but everything eventually sorts itself out.\n\nTarantino's directing influences, from John Woo to Martin Scorsese, are all in evidence, and their synthesis creates a high-voltage style that's entirely his own. The writing is crisp and clean, providing line after line of snappy dialogue designed to leave the viewer alternately pondering and laughing aloud. The gallows humor and dark comedy are among many of Reservoir Dogs' defining elements. This is one of those rare motion pictures that's both intelligent and visceral at the same time.\n\nHighly recommended with one caveat: those who are squeamish about blood should be wary.",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's ambitious directorial debut is all blood and guts.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino's indie crime drama Reservoir Dogs (1992) is filthy from the vile, racist, sexist, and crude language used by the seedy crooks to the blood gushing everywhere from bullet wounds. Tarantino lets his criminal heroes all feel like loathsome villains because of their crass conversations full of racist slurs, derogatory sexism, and vile mature language. They all come across as genuinely evil men with their own personalities and motivations. Tarantino's raw script and outrageously creative direction make Reservoir Dogs fascinating to me. It may forever be my favorite Tarantino film because of his extended monologues, bloody violence, crazy jokes, pleasant references, insane structure, and outstanding acting. Reservoir Dogs has it all. Tarantino's deft direction features cool long takes and neat nonlinear storytelling. Every time I rewatch it, I find it refreshingly different and original.\n\nTarantino said he was inspired by Stanley Kubrick's iconic heist crime drama The Killing and you can feel it in his desperate criminals after a botched robbery with guns raised at each other. Reservoir Dogs has a killer premise of only showing the aftermath of a botched jewelry robbery, then cleverly going back to introduce each codenamed criminal in flashbacks afterwards. I love how brazen Tarantino's writing choices feel with his unique vision and voice. Each guy feels original and realistic. Reservoir Dogs is all about his slick writing. Brutal violence alongside cute pop culture references to Madonna, Charles Bronson, and Lee Marvin being my favorites.\n\nEditor Sally Menke allows actors to deliver endless Tarantino dialogue in gripping conversations. Her cutting lets the conversations flow and feel sharp. I love her smooth fades to black and fade in transitions that help Tarantino's strange structure. Reservoir Dogs is a relentless 99 minutes of pure character acting with fearsome line delivery and memorable deaths. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula's smooth panning shots look as incredible as his enthralling close-ups for the hard hitting conversations. He makes everything feel claustrophobic and personal like we are in the room with his spinning shots around characters talking.\n\nHarvey Keitel is phenomenal as the smart professional bank robber Mr. White. He feels kind and friendly to Mr. Orange, who he befriends, showing an inner gentle side to his furious robber. Keitel is super cool and intelligent as Mr. White, but not clever enough to see through Mr. Orange's ruse. Keitel basically does a deep character study with Mr. White, who can calmly describe ruthlessly injuring hostages to get them to comply, while caring sincerely about Mr. Orange's feelings about getting shot. He's the loyal friend every guy has, while feeling like a career criminal, who has accomplished countless heists in his day. Reservoir Dogs is one of my absolute favorite acting performances from the mighty Harvey Keitel.\n\nTim Roth delivers one of cinema's great monologues with his undercover joke backstory as Mr. Orange. His pained wails after getting shot are so funny and he feels totally lived in as a character actor. His pumping himself up in the mirror before the big job is perfectly in character. I love Tim Roth as Mr. Orange. He's got such a chummy on screen friendship with Keitel's Mr. White with his friendly thief Mr. Orange.\n\nSteve Buscemi is hilarious as the cautious professional bank robber Mr. Pink. Buscemi absolutely steals all of his scenes with his casual defensive statement of never tipping, whining about getting the lame codename Mr. Pink, to his selfish vote to tear out of the warehouse with the diamonds on his own and leave the others for dead. Steve Buscemi feels real and lived in as his careful and nervous crook Mr. Pink.\n\nMichael Madsen's deranged turn as the psychopath Mr. Blonde will forever haunt me. His callous gunning down of civilians, torture of the policeman, to casually turning his gun on his fellow robbers is a truly demented villain performance. Madsen is chilling. Lawrence Tierney is a riot as mob boss Joe Cabot, who organizes the heist and doles out the cute, colorful codenames, much to the chagrin of Mr. Pink. Chris Penn's scummy performance as Nice Guy Eddie is amazing with his loyalty to his friend Vic and his father Joe. His final scream at Mr. White to stop pointing a guy at his father is burned into my mind.\n\nEdward Bunker is funny as Mr. Blue during the diner sequence, where he's stunned by Mr. Pink's reluctance to tip their poor waitress. Kirk Baltz is excellent as the captured cop Marvin Nash with his agonized wails that just sound painful. Randy Brooks' cameo as Detective Holdaway is nice, especially since he really sells the stakes to Mr. Orange about the severity of his undercover task.\n\nQuentin Tarantino gives himself a funny monologue as Mr. Brown for the opener about Madonna's 80's pop classic \"Like a Virgin\" and I appreciate his quick headshot death, so that we don't have to see him act too much. Tarantino was either really brazen and egotistical to cast himself as Mr. Brown or just thought it would be funny and cool to star alongside Harvey Keitel. Steven Wright's deadpan voice is so funny as DJ K-Billy for the cute musical transition bits in darkness.\n\nProduction designer David Wasco transforms a morgue into a desolate getaway warehouse for the robbers' meet up point. I liked that Mr. Orange's dirty apartment is filled with all sorts of neat character props from set decorator Sandy Reynolds-Wasco. The comic book and movie posters to the endless pocket change and cigarettes were a nice touch.\n\nSound designers Ron Bartlett, Stephen Hunter, Flick Curt Schulkey, Geoffrey G. Rubay, David E. Stone, and Charles Ewing Smith really play around with the sound mixing to immerse the audience in this perilous scenario. From the distant gunshots outside the warehouse to signify impending cops starting a shootout to the whirring of a police helicopter above to imply the fuzz are searching the area for the surviving robbers. I love how Tarantino's eclectic 1970's pop soundtrack will blare out, then get quieter when it's diegetic noise from a car radio. The loud roaring buzz of the plane engine noise is such a cool effect during a climactic encounter and resolute gunshot.\n\nCostume designers Betsy Heimann, Mary Claire Hannan, and Jacqueline Aronson create simply iconic black suit jackets and pants with white dress shirts and black ties for this surly gang of robbers. There's no argument to the fact that these are some of the greatest outfits in any film ever. Instantly recognizable and sleek for a classy affair. Michelle B\u00fchler's make-up features slashes, gaging bullet wounds, bloody hands, and bloody faces, not to mention the cut off ear prosthetic for the cop. It all looks grisly and real.\n\nIn short, Reservoir Dogs is a fierce debut from Quentin Tarantino with ruthless characters all doused in blood and bigotry.",

While he tries to give each of the characters his own persona, he wastes significant time that could've been used exploring these personas. However, the cast members compensate with their mature performances and their rigid eloquence. And of course, the movie is not bereft of the witty remark or the bawdy quip every here and there.",

All of these things contribute to the film's longevity, but its Icon Factor has to do with the content. When I say \"Icon Factor\", I mean that the film has specific things that make unique, iconic. When someone references a movie in conversation, they generally aren't talking about its cinematography or plotline, they're referencing a character, a quote, or a scene. That is the Icon Factor, and Reservoir Dogs has it in spades. The characters given names of \"Mr. [color]\" are iconic. The end scene feels iconic (even though it isn't given enough credit, mainly because it's overshadowed by other iconic scenes). The title is iconic. The opening conversation is iconic. And most of all, the torture scene is iconic. My goal is not to demean the quality of the movie by implying that its success is attributable to some abstract factor that I made up. The Icon Factor is the result of a movie being creatively distinct from others of its kind. Reservoir Dogs has this creative distinction that elevates it from a good movie to a great movie.",

This film includes funny and brilliant dialogues, a powerful cast (the strong performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Michael Madesen), the most sadistic scene of torture I ever seen, a director's cameo in a minor role, beautiful music and a WTF final. \n\nAlthough the low budget, the simple location and the simple story, this film is an extraordinary debut, I mean, he made himself remembered. \nThe style of the director is full of inspiration for me, how he moves the camera, how he put the music and the effects, everything. \nThe feeling you get when you watch the debut of a great director, knowing how far he has gone, is WOW, I mean, the first film from QT is something important. \n\nSo, the story is simple to understand, it is about another robbery gone wrong because of a cop infiltrated in the gang. \nWe don't see the robbery, but we know the most important information listening to the characters talking and screaming panicked to each other. \nIn this movie the intro-scene in a restaurant is in contrast with the absurd final. \nTo add this, the plot isn't chronological, the facts about the gang (how the members are inside it and their story) are told after the robbery. You can think it's a confused film, but it isn't. \nAlthough, in some strange way, in the beginning, the characters are close to each other maybe as a group of friends, for feel this, helps a lot the master shot in this scene the camera movement around their table. But after no, they suspect between themselves.\nThe relationship between the characters is simple, only for work even if sometimes they talk and act like friends. \nAfter all, I think they are good persons, in particular Mr. White in contrast with Mr. Pink who is egoistic and thinks only how to save his skin and how to earn. My favorite is Mr. Blonde, I like how he talks, how he is sarcastic and psycho.   \n\nChanging argument, I LOVE the music in this film, everything is connected by the radio program K-Billy's Super sound from the 70s. \nFor example: how Quentin Tarantino presents the characters is something special, I mean, I watched that scene like a hundred times (and I'm not kidding). \nThey walk in slow motion towards the robbery (but only after you realized towards what) on the notes the song Little green bag. \nIf we analyze this, we have first the screen all black with some credits and in the background the voice of K-Billy, then a wide shot where the gang walks from right to left of the frame. Later every character framed in a close-up and below the actor's name.\nFirst Harvey Keitel's Mr. White, second Michael Madsen's Mr. Blonde, then Chris Penn's Nice Guy Eddie, Steve Buscemi's Mr. Pink, Lawrence Tierney's Joe, Eddie Bunker's Blue, Quentin Tarantino's Brown and finally Tim Roth's Mr. Orange. \nAfter this we have another wide shot which in this appears the title of the film, then credits later interrupted by the Mr. Orange's screams. \n\nI love a lot the fact that Tarantino does this effects also in Pulp Fiction, he begins immediately the film with the dialogues and then he interrupted it with the credits paired the music, the music\u2026, I don't know how to describe it, maybe \"strange\" or \"exotic\". \nAnother example is when Blonde is going to torture a cop, Blonde put on the K-Billy's program and then begins the song Stuck in the middle with you. The character interacts with the music, he dances, he sings, and we feel fascinated by the power of music. \nFor finish the talk about music, even sometimes it fit \"wrong\" with the scene, the director makes it, in a word, perfect. \n\nI admit, before watching this movie I was skeptical about it but now I totally changed my mind and I love it, especially for the confused and intense final and why not, also the plot. \nFor concluding, I like this movie a lot and on 10 stars I would give 9. \n\nThanks for reading until this point :) \n\n\"You know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin playing just for the waitresses\" \n-Mr. Pink",

A handful of relatively colorful, presumably \"professional,\" criminals agree to risk their lives for a heist, though we have no clue why anyone would take such personal risk, given the danger of trusting utter strangers to have your back if things go wrong, as they do. These mugs talk clever and we're supposed to think they're smart, but their judgment is so tweaked, they come off stupid, the ending rather awkwardly predictable. Along the way, Tarantino has fun with gratuitous violence, but I don't share the glee. Kudos for cooking up a fresh twist on noir, and the soundtrack and acting impress, but not enough to justify the critics' rave reviews.",

I dont take any pleasure in the torture scene as I'm not a fan of that type of thing. But Micheal Madson pulls it off and makes the scene worth it. The conversation at the start about tipping is good and its typical Tarantino. Similar to the famous Hamburger scene that would come later in Pulp.. the cast is great here. An important film in recent cinema and a must watch. Just be prepared for blood and stuff but you should now that by now.

The dialogue is just top-tier Tarantino, especially the conversation about Christie Love in the car. The action is also gritty and moves really fast, it's just more realistic. The song choice is also great, the 70s definitely influenced this movie. The moral questions raised are also woven into the story really well.

The characters spend the entire movie in one location waiting for other characters to arrive.

A lot of minute detail goes into informing the film's characters through their winding stories and the resulting punchlines, but save for one awesomely head-scratching Madonna-related anecdotal analysis, neither the dialogue nor most of the characters themselves actually end up doing that much for me.\n\nThe hit or miss bag of scoundrels get tedious and a little self-indulgent, personally, and the casual foul language characteristic of Tarantino comes out a little too rotten in this particular instance and context. The acting's all good to great, with Tim Roth's weird performance going all in as the best of them, it's just the characters themselves that vary in interest as the movie skips between them. Regardless, the drama and mystery crackling between the gang before and after their scheme is enough to keep the film going at a compelling pace, increasingly snowballing into a high-hitting third act and conclusion.",

The writer and director, Quentin Tarantino is taking a discussion further than just a suggested idea in a bar. And on his side, before the argument even begins, is a crowd pleasing concept and enticing genre to follow. The film often tends to stay ahead of the game and provokes you, challenges you to be in sync with the storytelling. As a result a lot of time is spent upon placing the assumption, the imagination in your head as a viewer. Let's go through the scene where Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) tortures the cop.\n\nAt first, the condition, the premise is set by him. It helps you know the tone and endorses the upcoming event with a cautionary warning. And then comes the violence. But the violence isn't gruesome as it is painted and hyped in public opinion. Yes, there is literal blood baths in here, but I have seen much worse cringeworthy eye popping or screeching images. And I insist on its subtlety- if we can call it that- of the violence, is because most of it is left upon your imagination, innuendos are clear and crisp and hence the \"necessary\" clause goes out of the window.\n\nMaybe, that's why Madsen is shown leaving the music behind and come back to it, grooving as he yells out his final threat. That part, that dance, is the style that defines Tarantino's cinema. Before a shock is revealed which then turns itself into an ethical dilemma, what he is showcasing as a part of narrative is the style that we actually remember him and his films for. Reservoir Dogs is a flashy pop culture cinema, just like the conversations that it is brimming with, grounded by an eye on mythological creatures.",

            "content": "When I first saw this, I was the perfect age. An 18 year old student, film enthusiast, living away from home for the first time and thus in the right space for something that promised subversion and a bit of rebellion. I can't remember much of what I felt about the film, other than I really liked it and stumbled out in to the streets of my university town disoriented but energised, even adrenalised. I remember talking about it with my then girlfriend - who if I didn't know it by this point, would later (plot twist) turn out to be abusive. She said something that's stayed with me (although to be fair, because of what I've just shared with you about her, quite a bit of what she said and did has stayed with me). \"It wasn't really about anything; it was just really good.\" Fair? I'm not sure if it was at the time, and deep into Tarantino's career I'm still not sure. I don't remember seeing it again since then. Even so, revisiting it now with a new film from him on the horizon and the video stores he so loved now just a distant memory, I find my reactions to it even more confused all these 27 years later. \n\nDuring the opening exchange around the diner table, I reflected that though this dialogue was establishing character and the undercurrents of tension within the group which would soon erupt, the apparent misogyny was unnecessary. Like I remember someone saying of Eminem, there's no doubt Tarantino is clever but there's precious little evidence that he's wise. His insistence on putting the n-word in the mouth of white characters is more troubling now, understanding what I do. Tarantino's insistence on acting in all his own films, in relatively minor parts admittedly, is an early sign of his hubris and inability to hear the word 'no' from anyone (if, indeed, there's anyone willing to say it to him); his  complete dearth of acting talent, even in small doses, robs scenes he's in of the total immersion he so craves for his audience and otherwise can create so brilliantly. He's no Hitchcock; at least not in this regard.\n\nNevertheless, I was absorbed against my better judgement, wanting to dislike it but sucked in nonetheless. The threat of explosive, graphic violence is everywhere, but rarely seen. Of course the movie's most infamous scene of torture allows the camera to drift off to the side as the brutal act occurs, rendering it out of sight (or off-stage ... 'obscene' as the Greek tragedians would have termed such an unseen event). Does Tarantino know more Greek than we think he does? Whichever way you answer that question - and I'm still not sure - I was so gripped and absorbed in to the tension of the scene that the ending to it I deep down knew was coming was all the same a complete shock. I was open-mouthed. It's quite a trick to pull off, and a masterful piece of (mis)direction, performance and writing. \n\nIt strikes me now that it's brilliantly edited; an irony that's not lost now that he's seemingly incapable of discipline and economy. The reveal of the undercover policeman, and the final standoff, is also a masterpiece in how to achieve much by doing very little; the back and forth structure of the story-telling, filling out character backgrounds in repeating circles, adds a gracefulness to the structure at odds with the bleakness and moral chaos of the film's story. \n\nWhat to say, then? The film's influences and the films it has influenced are even clearer, of course, now. There's no doubt it's a clever use of genre tropes. But for all its cleverness, is there any wisdom in there? The question still hangs over Tarantino's output if he's cleverly exploring the consequences of nihilism and amorality within the confines of technical skill and increasingly baggy stories; or if he's just a naive kid who doesn't understand the forces he's playing with. For me, what's clever and brilliant about this debut has dimmed little with age; but knowing what we know now about his career, the questions and dis-ease it provoked at first have grown much louder. One suspects that even Tarantino himself doesn't know how to answer these questions; that we don't either suggests his wisdom really does fail to measure up to his cleverness.\n\nIn 2021 ... moved the rating from 3.5 to 5. Perfectly structured, and unlike many of his later films it's the perfect length for what it is.",

Surrounding the aftermath of a botched diamond heist, robbers adorned in black suits and ties must sniff out who ratted them to the police, escaping to a hideout of an abandoned warehouse. The film works like a stage play in its structure, most of it taking place in one room with brief flashbacks to the past showing how they landed in such dire circumstances, allowing it to revel in its small budget and perfect screenplay possessing dialogue that is concise, realistic and darkly funny. Often imitated but never equaled (except maybe in Tarantino's other films) the surviving thieves, nicknamed after colors to preserve their real-life identity, Mr. White, Mr. Pink and a severely wounded Mr. Orange question each other's loyalty as the clock ticks and paranoia swells. Performances given by Harvey Keitel, newcomer-at-the-time Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth create a tension that billows, and the sadistic Mr. Blonde played by Michael Madsen is a psychopath so cool you can't help but love him. Despite being Tarantino's first feature film, every scene is threaded precisely and equal to a master filmmaker, yet he makes it look so effortless that it transcends belief. The film continues to influence and inspire. And, it must be said that the ear torture scene still makes me cringe. It never fails to profoundly entertain no matter how many times I watch it. A celebration of noir, grindhouse cinema, heist movies and pulp that points a finger in the face of pretension and earns its medal as one of America's best films.",

Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) is a career criminal who takes a liking to newcomer Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and enjoys showing him the ropes. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is a weaselly loner obsessed with professionalism. Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) has just gotten out of jail after taking the rap on a job for Cabot; he's grateful for the work but isn't the same person he used to be. While Mr. Blonde goes nuts during the heist, the thieves are surprised by the sudden arrival of the police, and Mr. Pink is convinced one of their team is a cop. So who's the rat?\n\nMan. In all honesty, I was a Tarantino virgin up until this point. NO, really, I was. I hadn't watched a single one of his films. I don't know why because I'm a film major. That's ridiculous, right? Right?? Either way, this one is certainly an amazing first impression, as \"Reservoir Dogs\" was a fantastically written film that was executed well and certainly left a lasting impression. \n\n One thing that just truly impresses about this film is the dialogue. The dialogue is the strong part of this film, as it drives the story on its own. Is there a lot more to this story than the dialogue really? I would argue yes, but the main attraction is that. Tarantino knows how to put in realistic and brilliant dialogue that keeps you captivated and mesmerized. It had this dark, cynical humor to it that made you laugh when you shouldn't have, but feel when you should've. \n\nIn terms of the acting, I actually didn't really love it. This was a case of a lot of the guys overacting and being overdramatic. Now that's not to say there weren't great performances, because there were, but there were just some really iffy scenes. In contrary to that, there were also some awesome scenes and badass monologues. I guess the acting in general is a hit n' miss in this film. That's not terrible, as I'd give the acting an overall positive rating for this film.\n\nIn the end, I finally broke my Tarantino cherry and I'm certainly glad I did. This was a fantastic film and definitely a memorable one.",

Lewis, but also equal parts Jean-Pierre Melville and David Mamet. The story is a straightforward heist film, but what Tarantino does differently is how he structures his story. Fro one, he never shows the actual heist and a majority of the film is the events following the failed heist, with flashbacks to events prior to said heist. Flackbacks have become a trademark of Tarantino's, but he uses them in a way that serves the story, providing necessary information for the audience at a specific time. Another major departure from standard heist films is Tarantino's dialogue, which is amazingly sharp and fun to listen to. No one write like he does, though he has plenty of imitators who've attempted to mimic his voice, it's a kind of artificial movie-speak that will either delight or annoy filmgoers. When you top all that off with an amazing cast, that includes Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Tim Roth, and classic film heavy Lawrence Tierney, it's hard to imaging this film going far wrong. Of special note, Madsen especially gives good in a can't-take-your-eyes-off-of-him performance as the psychotic Mr. Blond. Much like Anthony Perkins' performance in \"Psycho,\" this role for Madsen pretty much typecast him as a smiling villian for much of his career. Tarantino has been called out for copying much of the plot of Ringo Lam's Hong Kong action film \"City on Fire.\" Without revealing any spoilers, the story is undeniably similar, right down to some very specific scenes. However, as good a film as \"City on Fire\" is, \"Reservoir Dogs\" is soooo much better. Tarantino clearly lifted many story elements from that film, but he used them to make a much stronger film. Re-watching this film now, another fun element is you get to watch Tarantino's cinematic universe begins to take shape, with character being potentially related to or appearing to other Tarantino stories, with the names Alabama (\"True Romance\"), Vega (\"Pulp Fiction\"), Skagnetti (\"Natural Born Killers\"), Marvin Nash (\"Natural Born Killers\" and \"Pulp Fiction\") all getting mentioned at one point or another. But as I wrote at the top of this review, Tarantino completely has my number and his sensibilities seem perfectly in sync with my own, which is probably why I see \"Reservoir Dogs\" as a true cinematic classic.",

The over-the-top violence is captivating as well as the discussions the numerous men have with each other. The only problem is that the flashback sequences do seem to drag a bit. Other than that, great performances, excellent cinematography, and a cool over all charm.",

            "content": "Seeing as to how this is Tarantino's filmmaking debut, the movie is a little rough around the edges here and there.\n\nThe story is good, though a little too simple at its core. After a crew of criminals robs a jewelry store - and get ambushed by the police in doing so - they flee to an abandoned warehouse, one at a time. To start off, the two crew members nicknamed \"Mr. White\" and \"Mr. Orange\" arrive at the warehouse, the latter of whom has been shot in the gut with a single revolver bullet, and is unable to function like a half-decent person due to the pain he has to bear. \"Mr. Pink\", \"Mr. Blonde\", \"Nice Guy Eddie\" and their employer \"Joe Cabot\" arrive subsequently. The movie depicts the conflicts that arise everytime a new member arrives at the warehouse; after all, they're suspicious of each other, since one of them must've informed the police about the robbery.\n\nWhat I liked about the movie was the way the characters were gradually presented to the viewer. Every crew member new to the screen got their introduction through a snippet of backstory. The way this very achronologically-presented information unfolds, feels very organic. It gives the ever-so-flat characters the least of depth one could desire them to have. The humor and other interactions the crew members share is very coarse, though at the same time relatively relatable.\n\n***THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS***\nHowever, as I already mentioned in the start of this review, \"Reservoir Dogs\" has its -\n sometimes very prominent - flaws. \nFirstly, the quirk that made it even hard to watch at times, is how dragged out most scenes are. The opening scene is abnormally elongated with an argument about what Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" is about, along with a lecture on why people should or shouldn't tip the waitress. One of the following scenes shows Mr. Orange having exaggerated spastic tendencies and bawling his eyes out for an eternity and a half whilst having the same back-and-forth with Mr. White multiple times (\"I'm going to die\" - \"No, you're okay\"). He passes out shortly after, and fills the role of prop for about the entire movie. Sometime after that, the audience gets to watch how Mr. Blonde tortures a kidnapped policeman for 7 whole minutes - way longer than being even remotely justifiable - which just gets annoying and stale, just like every other dragged out scene (which literally occurs every other scene).\nSecondly, the anatomical realism in different situations doesn't add up at all: Mr. Orange's whole shirt is completely drenched in blood nearing the end of the movie, caused by a single shot wound in his abdomen that never really appears to stop bleeding. The pain this causes is apparently so enormous, he can only flail his limbs around, wail and pass out. This as opposed to the cop that gets tortured and mutilated into oblivion, even having one of his ears slashed right off, with barely any blood gushing from the gaping hole in his head. What's more, is that he's able to keep it all together after all this, having the ability to think and communicate more distinctly than Mr. Orange. \nAll that is without mentioning the one scene using a split-focus diopter (what were you thinking, Tarantino?!), the plot hole of Nice Guy Eddie getting shot without anyone pointing a gun at him, the dubious role of the police, the mediocre ending (although a movie like this couldn't really have a proper ending, I suppose), etc...\n\nI would recommend to watch this movie for its cultural value, but I don't think it excels in any filmographic category.",

Every actor gives it their all, with Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth giving especially great performances. The script, directing, and cinematography are all Oscar-worthy. The lower-than-planned budget actually works to the film's advantage, since it led to the decision to have most of the film take place in a single location. This helps elevate the film as a whole by telling a smaller, more personal story. Repeat viewings are made more interesting by all the little details you didn't notice the last time you watched it. Like all movies, it has its flaws, but they're small and insignificant, as well as few and far between. Reservoir Dogs may not be Tarantino's best, but it definitely earns the title of Timeless Classic.",

I had an issue for most of the film because, similar to most gangster films, I can't root for any of the characters. But there was a surprising shift just over halfway through the film, that I totally didn't see coming, and suddenly I was on board and completely sold on the story. Most of the cast is amazing, particularly Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel. I just take issue with Michael Madsen. He is so flat and I don't like his mumbled line delivery at all. His entire flashback scene was easily the low point of the entire movie. However that is short-lived and it gets back to the good stuff without too much delay. For a film with such a simple premise I was delighted that it managed to surprise me several times. Tarantino shows that, while other aspects of his talent took some time to develop, his writing was strong from the get-go. His weak point early on might have been shot selection, though. They often show things in a very wide shot and don't follow the actors even to the point of letting them just walk out of frame so we're staring at nothing. This kind of camerawork can be used in some very clever ways in other films (to build tension or cleverly avert the viewers' attention,) but I didn't see any purpose here. That being said, Reservoir Dogs is a quality film that is worth watching, but not one of Tarantino's better films in my opinion.",

The basic plot is a jewel heist gone wrong, and a group of criminals suspect one of their partners is a cop. I love how they never actually show the heist, just the set up and the aftermath.

            "content": "Six criminals, who are unknown to each other, are hired by a crime boss, Joe Cabot (Lawerence Tierney) to stage a diamond robbery. Right at the outset, they are given aliases, colour coded Mr White, Mr Pink and so on, with Cabot and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) only knowing their real names. Pretty sure that hiring some capable cons that the robbery will go ahead without a hitch.  However when the Police are right outside as the gang exit the building this is put paid to.  Panic ensues and in the course of trying to evade the police two of the gang are shot dead as well as a number of civillians and cops.  Two of the remaining members of the gang Mr White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr Orange (Tim Roth) evade capture and death and head to the rendezvous point a warehouse, though Orange has been shot in the stomach, not soon after Mr Pink (Steve Buscemi) turns up and suggests to White that there must be a rat amongst the group due to the police presence as soon as they left the jewellers.\n\nNot many directors have entered onto the stage with such an electrifing debut, if any film maker defined the 1990's it was Quentin Tarantino.  A testimony to his influence as he only actually released three films in the decade but the shockwave that this film and it's follow up Pulp Fiction sent out informed any number of films that followed. Infact some pretty pale immitations arrived in it's wake.  Guy Ritchie's well received but ultimately vastly overrated debut Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels owes both films more than a debt.   Tarantino never a director shy of stealing from other works and stealing is the right word because he doesn't borrow he outright robs ideas and then fashions them in his own image. Ringo Lam's 1987 film City On Fire and obvious reference point and Joseph Seargeant's terrific 70's thriller The Taking of Pelham 123 is clearly where the colour coded element was nicked from. One critic intoned mediocre artists borrow whereas great artists steal and make better.\n\nTarantino changed the face of the crime film in the space of two films.  As someone who witnessed this on the cinema screen back January 1993 when it was released in the UK (twice infact) I was litterally blown away by the visceral power and the quick fire foul mouthed dialogue. Tarantino was like a profanity poet, using swearing like an art form.  To think how much film and televison dialogue as been infomed by his style, the heigtened reality of criminals talking about music, television and films in their day to day interactions. Tarantino nails his stall out from the get go as the now instantly quotable opening sequence which the director himself as in the minor role of Mr Brown is discussing rather explicitly what Madonna's \"Like A Virgin\" is about. Today this kind of writing is rife in pop culture, the likes of the hugely influential British comedy TV series Spaced ( Tarantino a self confessed fan) and then it's U.S benefactor The Big Bang Theory are littered with the characters quoting dialogue from the world of entertainment. It would not be over estimating to say although it could be argued better directors have come along since, none of them have been quite and distinctive and influnetial as Tarantino.\n\n\nTarantino's clearly knows the areas to take influence from, Martin Scorcesse showed how adept he was at using pop music to soundtrack his films, nowhere else had that been obvious in his 1989 gangster masterpiece Goodfellas. Using the fictional radio station K Billy's Super Sound of the 70's with the disembodied dead pan voice of  comedian Steven Wright introducing the tracks, the station even gets referenced by the gang during the film.  Though Tarantino having a habit to use songs not so well known songs and then elevate them to another level. Take for instance the opening credits of the film after the prologue.  The director accompanies the sequence with the then little known \"Little Green Bag\" by the George Baker Selection, a scene that is a homage in it's own right to Kubricks's Clockwork Orange, the group exiting the diner to head off to the job at hand, Tarantino hits the slow motion button and a little known song instantly becomes a classic. The scene has more than an echo of Alex and the Droogs walking in slow motion to the strains of Rossini's  overture to la gazza ladra (the thieving magpie).  The director than continue to mine his record collection, Harry Nilsson, Bedlam and Sandy Rogers amongst the soundtrack.  Athough Stealer's Wheels more famous \"Stuck In The Middle of You\" would never sound the same again after Mr Blonde's (Michael Madsen) infamous torture sequence, a moment that caused fiffteen people to walk out when it was screened at Sitges film festival, which included Wes Craven and horror make up supremo Rick Baker.  Baker later told Tarantino to take the walkout as a \"compliment\" and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism.  The film would be dogged with controversy, particularly in the UK, it didn't receive a VHS home release until 1995.  The BBFC has initially refused it a certificate as films need to be seperately reclassified for home consumption.  The film is undoubtedly violent, although unlike some of the directors later work this has realistic sense of consequence.\n\nAs the directors career has progressed he has got himself a reputation for resurrecting actors careers. Harvey Keitel had almost disappeared into obscurity despite including a number of Scorcesse classics on his C.V.  Mr White offered the veteran performer a peach of a role and one that would bring him to a whole new audience. His character serves as the heart of the film and while a sociopath one with a code, which makes his realisation at the end of the film that more powerful.  Michael Madsen's Mr Blonde in comparisson is a stone cold psychopath and his key moment as mentioned in the previous paragraph  is chilling.  Tim Roth more well known in his native Britain spends most of the film lying down bleeding although just like White and Blonde earlier gets more to do when his back story is revealed.  Tarantino himself takes a minor role of Mr Brown, Eddie Bunker also appears briefly as Mr Blue. Bunker a reformed convict who had gone onto be an acclaimed crime novelist and screenwriter in his own right.\n\nSteve Buscemi, while never leading man material has since carved out an impressive character acting career, having gone on to direct a number of features as well as be a prolific televison director including some of the most memorable Soprano's episodes as well as appearing as Tony Soprano's cousin in Season 5 of the series. Most recently seen headlining acclaimed HBO series Boardwalk Empire. Practically unknown at the time, his Mr Pink is an undoubted highlight of the film, a real slime ball, from the moment we see him trying to avoid contributing to his share of the tip in the prologue, showing no sympathy for the waitresses plight. Not bothered to look bad amongst his colleagues who rightly chastise him for it.  Buscemi makes sure that the audience isn't likely to sympathise with him but he does emerge the most professional of the group and appears the only one with his eye on the prize, hence he is the one who bothers to make sure he has the diamonds they were there to swipe in the first place.\n\nIt could be said  that Tarantino makes no secret of where this is going, the film plays out for the most in the warehouse which on closer inspection is revealed as a slaughter house. There is also a hearse parked in the foreground. The director has never been one for subtlety throughout his career, everyone is undoubtedly heading in one direction.\n\nReservoir Dogs remains one of the directors best films, my personal preference would be for his third and under appreciated entry Jackie Brown as my favourite but his debut wouldn't be far behind.  Also the short running time is rarity as after this Tarantino would favour a more leisurely pace and epic length going forward. Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown would be nearly an hour longer.  Reservoir Dog more economic length could be attributed to it's  $1.2 Million budget irregardless of this Tarantino packs plenty in and with the exception of Jackie Brown invests the film with heart and soul.  Pulp Fiction for all it's ambition and memorable set pieces is somewhat of a cold fish, lot of style and clearly wanting to impress it's quite superficial with not much below the surface.  It's predecessor in comparrison has a beating heart and it's ending is bleak and hits home, none of the directors other films would end with such a sobering denouncement.\n\nStill as effective and shocking as it was 24 years ago, Reservoir Dogs remains a potent mixture of scintilating dialogue and palpable suspense with all round excellent performances.  The film announced a distinctive and exciting talent and love him or hate him, the world of film would be a much duller place without Quentin Tarantino around.",

            "content": "4.5 / 5.  Tarantino's first film is a memorably engaging character piece set during the aftermath of a chaotic jewel heist and the subsequent realisation that one of the thieves is actually an undercover cop.  The genesis of the story can be found in the 1987 HK action flick \"City on Fire\", specifically from a three minute scene at the end of that film which obviously inspired Tarantino to explore the concept further and with arguably much greater inventiveness.  Aside from this one sequence, in which the cop reveals to the thief his real identity, there are no similarities and I'll use this opportunity to remind Tarantino's critics to actually watch \"City on Fire\" before accusing him of plagiarising it.  The guy's vision is his own:  \n\nA handpicked cast led by Harvey Keitel, who championed the film and in the process created a keystone performance for his own late-career renaissance, with Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and even the legendary Laurence Tierney playing parts which feel specifically drawn for them.  Tarantino's use of upbeat 1970's funk, soul and pop music over his signature stylised violence creates a compelling juxtaposition of horror and levity, and the film draws itself to an altogether thrilling climax as tensions and suspicions gradually boil over.  The structure of the narrative is a compelling jigsaw of flashback character based exposition and the relentless domino-effect of consequences.  \n\nTarantino's writing and direction are clever, taut and highly effective, producing a highly engaging and unique crime caper - a darkly comic and violent ensemble piece driven by memorable characters and intriguing storytelling.",

I see a lot of similarities between this film and his latest, The Hateful Eight. Both films obviously were almost entirely dialogue, but Reservoir Dogs was just so uninteresting and I really did not like the ending. The Hateful Eight was excellent in making me care about each character equally while making me laugh all the way. Reservoir Dogs was easy to figure out and I really did not care at all about most of the characters.

        },
        {
            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's habit of telling stories in inconsequential order has a striking effect on his movies.  Take, for instance, his 2003 masterpiece, \"Kill Bill Vol. 1,\" whose first official \"chapter\" does not bear an elongated, dramatic name, but simply '2.' Such a puzzle piece doesn't make sense to the viewer right away - it isn't until later clues arrive that tell us that technically, the last death in the movie is actually the first, and the victimization of the knife happy Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), which we originally thought to be the gold, is really the silver.  Tarantino's storytelling techniques make his films seem more epic, more grand - there's always a feeling that there's more to the story than what's being presented.\n\tHis directorial debut, 1992's \"Reservoir Dogs,\" if told chronologically, would be a novel tale of a diamond heist gone wrong.  But it all seems to be much more than that, as exemplified by Tarantino's introduction to the characters with a discussion about the true meaning behind Madonna's \"Like a Virgin,\" jumping to, only seconds later, the bloody aftermath of the heist.  Most of what happens in-between is later addressed, but not the diamond heist, and not a lot of group interaction.  We fill in the blank spaces up later, imagining what really went down as a pastime.  That's why Tarantino's films stick with you long after you've finished them - so much time is spent on chatter and violent standoffs that we're pressed to conceptualize the darker details ourselves.  Becoming absorbed should be expected.\n\tAt a mere 99 minutes, it is Tarantino's shortest film, and admittedly wears the feeling of a film made by an confident auteur still not yet confident enough to go out in public with the bolder aspects of his aesthetic values.  Perhaps such an opinion derives from the fact that it was the only film in Tarantino's oeuvre I had not yet seen, and therefore am better used to when he's working big.  Regardless, the film is masterful, a fine initiation to his talents in the same way \"Blood Simple\" worked for the Coen Brothers.  The control he has over his dialogue, his actors, is startling for an artist who was only 29 at the time of conceit - \"Pulp Fiction,\" to come out two years later, would be the superglue to land him a spot alongside the greatest writer/directors of all time.\n\tThe story, famous by now, covers the orchestration and aftereffects of a jewelry store robbery gone to shit, wisely refraining from detailing the crime itself.  The blueprint is set in motion by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney), a wrinkled, cranky crime boss who hires a group of energetic lugs to do the dirty work and gives them code names that keeps personable conversation a thing of the past.  All are criminals who talk and walk tough but handle violence like sensitive civilians - the only people in the group able to assert their dominance over any given situation are Eddie Cabot (Chris Penn), Joe's deceivingly friendly son, and Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), a psychopath who listens to 1970s pop radio while inflicting violence on others.  But one member of the heist is actually a cop deep undercover, thickening what would normally be a routine job.\n\t\"Reservoir Dogs\" would cause most viewers to undergo a knee-jerk reaction had the tone been a little more serious.  Tarantino, always seeming to be half-joking, subtly jabs his characters for their incompetence - it's all a matter of karma, and trying to empty a diamond store is no way to live.  Tarantino's compact understanding of Cabot's squad heightens their three-dimensionality; while, in essence, them discussing why \"True Blue\" sucks, why tipping at a diner doesn't matter, or why Pam Grier is the ultimate blaxploitation female, appear to be topics of superficial smallness, it speaks volumes about them.  Concerned with unimportant matters, only to turn to crime a second later, it portrays them as observant wallflowers who never fit in anywhere, looking for sinful activity to discover fellowship in not so idyllic places.  Personal appearance is of utmost priority, even in the face of potential death - look at the way Harvey Keitel takes a break from arguing with Steve Buscemi post-failed heist just to check himself out in the mirror, comb his hair.  These men like to look cool, but don't like the baggage that comes along with lifetime criminality.\n\tTarantino's dialogue is entertaining in and of itself, but the actors representing his attitudes and conversational fantasies are what make \"Reservoir Dogs\" the electrifying experience that it is.  Tierney, as the head honcho of the operation, is a grumpy curmudgeon not to be messed with; Penn, playing his son, is in the category of the two-faced villain approachable one moment and sadistic the next.  Roth, Keitel, and Buscemi, given the best moments in the screenplay, all seem like everymen who don't know what the hell they've gotten themselves into.  Michael Madsen, the standout of the cast, is a charming masochist.\n\tBut \"Reservoir Dogs\" is Tarantino's show - his then-youthful talent is so invigorating that one cannot help but feel lucky that his flawless filmography is available for reference, anytime, anywhere.  I cannot imagine a time during which he wasn't yet considered to be one of cinema's most individualistic auteurs.  Everyone has to start somewhere; thank god he got off on the right foot.",

But for those who saw Reservoir Dogs knew Tarantino was something special before Pulp Fiction ever came out.  Yeah it is a stylish gangster flick about a bunch of low down bum criminals put together to pull off a diamond heist in broad daylight.  They never have met each other, and they do not know each others names.  All they know is they were put together by a guy named \"Joe\" and are going to pull this job together and meet up at a safe house after it is all done to divvy up the prize.  Well, to say that is doesn't go according to plan would be a bit of an understatement.  I am not going to dive into the plot because it will ruin the movie for you.  But to me this is much more than just a gangster heist movie.  Tarantino focuses on the fallout after the heist actually takes place.  We never really see what happens during the heist, only after.  So Tarantino uses his classic dialogue from the characters to piece the story together for you.  And let you decide who is telling the truth.  All you know going into the heist is one of the is a cop.  What we get with Reservoir Dogs is a great movie.  Some spot on dialogue and great story telling through the characters who we never get to know to much about.  If you enjoy all of his movies you are going to enjoy this one.",

            "content": "It's very rare that we see a director establish him- or herself as a true talent with their first theatrical release. Not only did Tarantino establish himself as a great storyteller with the release of Reservoir Dogs, he also gave us a glimpse of his distinct artistic voice that we would anticipate in the years to come. He specifically set a trend in the use of dialogue which reminds us of everyday conversations yet is simultaneously layered with subtext and analogies.\n\nThe opening sequence establishes Tarantino's master of dialogue perfectly. While the conventional director might open a robbery film with a scene which highlights the plan for the robbery, Tarantino strays away from exposition.  Instead, we get a lengthy conversation in which the robbers analyze a song, discuss the ethics of tipping waitresses, and make pop culture references. What does this do? It establishes the characters as human beings and gives them life instead of having the boss merely explain the plot to the robbers, who would substitute for the audience.\n\nThis might have to do entirely with the fact that the film had a low budget, but Tarantino essentially uses one location for about two thirds of the film. He is still able to establish an intricate and very tense story revolving around the idea that one of the robbers suspects an undercover cop is amongst them. The set design is simple - an abandoned warehouse - so the visual creativity of the film is mostly in the cinematography, but even with that, the heavy use of the warehouse as a setting makes this come across as more of a play, which it should.  The dialogue is the driving force of this film, and while the characters may discuss plot at points (I hate it when movies rely on explanations of the plot through dialogue, a la Inception) it is only done when it is necessary. The rest of the dialogue reveals much more about the characters than visuals could provide in this film, and hey, I'm okay with that.\n\nOne problem I have with the film is the fact that while this film revolves around a group of robbers we never learn too much about two of the robbers since they are hardly in the movie. In fact, one of them only has a few lines in the opening conversation scene of the film. The absence of that character would hardly change the meaning of the film at all, which is why I wish we would have gotten to know him a bit more.  I understand side characters, but in a film about a group of robbers, the entire group should have a significant part in the film as an ensemble cast.\n\nA great directorial debut for Quentin Tarantino, Reservoir Dogs shines as a surprising hit for a crime film with such a low budget and as a huge influence on the manner of dialogue used in crime films between its release and present day.\n\n3.5/4.0",

Tarantino has made several iconic films including, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. He is known for making quirky, bloody, and balls to the walls crazy films. His style is not for everyone, but once you see a Tarantino film, there's no going back. \"Reservoir Dogs'' is the directorial debut of Tarantino. It stars Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, and Michael Madsen. \n\n The plot follows eight men who are planning a diamond heist. One of the men is a undercover cop in their midst. As they are escaping the crime scene, one of them gets shot and is bleeding out. The majority of the film centers on the men within the team, showing you how each became involved. \n\nPersonally, I thought Tim Roth delivered the best performance. The film is chalk full of talent. All the actors do a fantastic job. They all work very well together. None of the characters are particularly interesting, nor do they have any depth. However, the dialogue they are given is so great that I can overlook that. \n\nQuinton Tarantino did a marvelous job directing this film. For a first picture, it's quite solid. This was an independent film that garnered allot of critical praise. As far as independent films go, this is one of the best. It's got a very smart script. The dialogue and comedy between characters is what kept me in engaged. Whether it was a diner table conversation or two guys yelling uncontrollably at each other, it was very fun to watch. \n\n\"Reservoir Dogs'' is a bloody, smartly written, and entertaining piece of cinema. It may suffer from uninteresting characters with no depth, but the fact that Tarantino could make something so impressive on a low budget makes me appreciate it.",

After the heist turns into a bloodbath, some members believe that one of them has betrayed them so a quest for finding the rat starts. \nAlong with Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino is consider one of the best, if not the best, modern directors by countless people, but to be honest I don't love him as much as the rest of the world, I think he is great director and very talented writer but he doesn't know when to stop, sorry, I had to mention that before starting the review. \"Reservoir Dogs\" is a pretty strong directorial debut as it has a strong cast that provides solid/memorable performances with the best being Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi; the dialog is memorable, quotable and funny; a perfect use of music, a solid screenplay, memorable scenes, a serviceable story that is clearly influenced and even at time mimics Kubrick\u00b4s breakthrough film \"The Killing\", and Tarantino flawlessly established his known well known style with the vulgar language, \"excessive\" violence, non chronological storytelling, paying homage to older films and straightforward writing, despite the nonlinear storytelling. The only problem I have is the wasted potential: The writing may be solid but the story is predictable, there are no themes here (while some say that the loyalty between criminals is one, the film is not about that), the fast pacing takes away the character development and the film could have used some doses of ambiguity instead of being so fast and straightforward. \n\"Reservoir Dogs\" is a highly entertaining and rewatchable film that shows the potential of Tarantino\u00b4s directing style, but it also could have offered more. It is a great and memorable film filled with style that deserves its cult status but it is not a masterpiece.",

As his usual trademark, the dialogue and the screen writing is very hilarious, with a lot of humor and fun. The story starts in the middle of everything. They are a group of syndicate with connections here and there, yet everything is f*cked up. Another brilliantly, genuinely made flick from Quentin.

So much about Reservoir Dogs nearly errs on the side of caustic. Between the rambling speeches, numerous pop culture references, and oft-putting material, it all nearly self destructs. Revisionist and raw, however, the ballistics behind this pulp paperback gangster film reveal it to be a very suspenseful and very smart character study. Despite how deplorable these men come across (obviously, some more than others), glimmers of humanity rise to the top. It's a Reservoir Dog-eat-Reservoir Dog world in LA's underbelly but human nature still exists as much as criminal nature. Also, for the most part, the pop references aren't disposable. Frankly, they're already classic as Tarantino's vivid edginess makes the film more than just a simple throwback. Between the seamless integration of K-Billy's Super Sounds of the '70s and locker room discussions of dated cop shows, you actually feel like you're watching a '70s crime thriller...albeit one with a very unique modern punch. His world starts to feel too outlandish at times but this is an unapologetic heightened reality. \n\nIn this R-rated crime-thriller, the surviving criminals of a jewel heist gone awry begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant.\n\nBeyond the direction, the amazing performances ground the gruff roughnecks at the center of the familiar but colorful story with enough verve and rawness for an entire cable TV mini-series. Their dialogue might seem long-winded but that's just it: it's dialogue, not monologues--oftentimes broken up in a rat-a-tat fashion that keeps you fully invested with an almost maddening tension. Plus, the out-of-sequence storytelling makes this particular take on the well-worn heist film seem fresh. How else could a twist delivered in the 1st act carry through and still end up as a double-barrel gut-punch at the very end? True Romance was supposed to mark Tarantino's writing-directing debut, but Reservoir Dogs nonetheless rings true and betrays a great romance with classic cinema.\n\nBottom line: Au Revoir Les Enfants, Bonjour Magnifique",

The script is quick, witty and hugely entertaining, something Tarantino has become well known for over the years. The casting has been done well. Every character looks their part, be it Harvey Keitel as the ruthless Mr. White or Steve Buscemi as the narcissist Mr. Pink or Michael Madsen as the sadistic Mr. Blonde. Even with its low budget, Reservoir is the epitome of cool . The suit and tie attire proved to be not only economical but also looked cool in the most kickass way possible.

Tarantino would go on to enjoy multiple successes and become a house hold name, but it is his earliest concoctions that really grab his true and unwavered love for film and thrust them into our faces. Dogs revolves around a gang of thugs, put together by a father and son family crime syndicate. When a jewel heist goes horribly wrong, speculation of a snitch within the group begin to spread like wild fire, forcing old friends to become bitter enemies in the blink of an eye. The great thing about this complex sounding film is that it isnt complex at all. You dont see the bank heist, you dont get back stories for every character, there is very little filler included in here. The action revolves around the current predicament, the fallout from the fuck up and its in this position we feel like part of the team itself. Scratching our heads with them, getting upset with them, speculating on their behalf. This would all fall to shit if the cast and script were not of par and both are a cut above the rest. Tarantino's script gets across true characters, refrencing trends within conversations, making these people feel real, rather than actors. Helping this scenario is the fact that the cast include, now breathe deeply, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Harvey Kietel, Quentin Tarantino, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. Each and every one of these actors slam dunks their iconic roles, while bitch slapping us with their distinct conversational skills. The direction is fluid also, its no secret that Quentin has taken from the best and used it to his advantage, but here he just includes so many iconic cinema moments in history. The image of all the friends holding guns towards one another being a perfect representation of this, or even Mr Blonde's dancing/torture routine. He keeps us invested throughout the entire experience, shocking us all by the end. The film still holds up over 20 years since its release, it is as iconic as it is influential, even if some of the ideas are tried and tested, jam packed with a cracking soundtrack and you have yourself a cult classic on your hands. There are a couple of minor flaws here and there, inconsistancies between cuts and a bit too much over exposure on one character later on in the film but these things dont hurt the movie, just add more of an indie feel to the whole experience. Want an example of how to raise the bar and struggle to hit it? Look no further.",

            "content": "\"Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and I wanna know who's name's on the handle\"\n\nBefore becoming a cinematic auteur a young Quentin Tarantino worked in the film rental store Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, and would often recommend little-known titles to customers. On one occasion, he suggested Louis Malle's \"Au Revoir Les Enfants\", to which the customer mockingly replied, \"I don't want to see no Reservoir Dogs.\" And so the title of Tarantino's blistering debut film was born. It was originally planned as a $30,000 personal film with his friends, before Harvey Keitel showed an interest in the script and came onboard as the star and co-producer which helped hike the budget up to $1.5 million. The rest, as they say, is history. Tarantino had finally made his mark on the movie map and has since become one of the most highly praised directors of his, or any other, generation.\n\nCrime lord Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) assemble a crew of trusted criminals who they appoint with colour coded aliases to protect their identity: Mr. White, (Harvey Keitel), Orange (Tim Roth), Pink (Steve Buscemi), Blue (Eddie Bunker), Brown (Quentin Tarantino) & Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen). Their plan is simple: rob a jewellery store and make off with the diamonds to a prearranged rendezvous. However, the robbery doesn't go down well and those that are left alive suspect that they have a police informant amongst them.\n\nFew debuts have made as much of an impact on cinema goers as Reservoir Dogs has. It heralded the arrival of an energetic new writer/director and opened up the floodgates to numerous crime imitations thought the 1990's. Few, if any, achieved the same impact. However, there were some that criticised Tarantino for being a plagiarist. There were obvious references to films like Stanley Kubrick's The Killing, John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle, Joseph Sargent's The Taking of Pelham 123 and most notably Ringo Lam's City on Fire. Without a doubt, Tarantino was influenced by these movies but stealing is a very strong accusation. Now, many years and several more films down the line, I think it's fair to say that Tarantino has an extensive film vocabulary and often pays homage to some of his favourite filmmakers. Film knowledge may be deemed esoteric by some but in Tarantino's case it helped him craft three of the best films from the 1990's - along with Dogs there was, of course, Pulp Fiction and the vastly underrated Jackie Brown. And besides the point of plagiarism, it was Tarantino's dialogue (entirely his own) that received the most praise for it's true originality. His characters talk fast and the words seem to jump of the screen and that's exactly where Reservoir Dogs' strengths lie. \n\nIf it wasn't for the non-linear, chronology of events it would essentially be a chamber piece. Set largely within the confines of an abandoned warehouse, each character talks through what actually went wrong during their bungled heist. The heist itself is never witnessed as Tarantino decides to focus on the aftermath of the robbery rather than the event itself but it's the sharp and descriptive dialogue that allows these events to come to life in our imagination and each of the actors are allowed to spout their words with as much colour and vibrancy as their blood soaked shirts.\n\nThere are many highlights amongst the ensemble but the three that stand out the most are the loyally professional Harvey Keitel, a highly-strung and opinionated Steve Buscemi and the cold, psychopathic Michael Madsen. If I had any issues with the cast at all, it would be Tim Roth's tendency to overplay his work. He, by no means, delivers a poor performance but too often over acts and his personal section of the story interrupts an otherwise precisely structured flow. This is a small gripe as Tarantino still has a solid handling on the material and executes it with the deftness and skill of a director twice his age. On this evidence alone his extensive, esoteric knowledge of film certainly paid off - not only for him but for the viewer.\n\nHeavily influenced by the likes of Martin Scorsese and Brian DePalma, among many other filmmakers, Tarantino was certainly not the first to use non-linear storylines, Steadicam techniques or distinctive soundtracks but he was a luminary to ambitious young directors that followed,  and a lot of that came from this breathtaking film that set a whole new benchmark. One critic described Reservoir Dogs as \"...a bloody, brash, brilliant heist thriller that grabbed audiences by the lapels and kneed them in the crotch\"... I couldn't have put it any better myself.\n\nMark Walker",

Reservoir Dogs is a unique experience, which shows that the before and after of a heist can be much more interesting than the heist itself; after all, the film never shows us the actual heist, but the preparations and the aftermath, and is thanks to Tarantino's scriptwriting talents that it works. While not entirely what I wanted and expected to see, the film still makes-up with its uniqueness.\n\nThe cast is awesome and does all-right as expected, but we don't get too deep on them, which fits, after all, we are not supposed to. Even so, it still makes a huge impact. The story is told in a non-linear way (again, Tarantino's direction), similar yet very different to Christopher Nolan's Memento or David Lynch's Eraserhead. Because of the tension and anxiety of not knowing what's going on, the violence here works as a nerve-pumping method that increases fear. I've heard and read of people actually walking out from this movie because the violence was too much. It's not that it's incredibly gory, it's just that it's effective. Some modern horror directors and writers should look at this picture for some good advice. Still, after watching, I had no idea what it was about. It's hard to tell, but it all comes together when you think about it twice.\n\nAll I have left to say is that this is a good movie, and surely got my nerves when it wanted to. It has a style and approaches the most of it. It's not perfect, but it surely acts like it.",

            "content": "Tarantino's first feature film is very clever and iconic in every way. Reservoir Dogs is about a group of 6 robbers that run away from a failed heist and as a result get into a huge fight once they find out there's a rat in the group. This film has incredible performances from the talented cast consisting of Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, and even Quentin Tarantino himself. The whole movie is fueled by these great performances and their really good dialogue. The characters bounce off each other like a rubber ball bounces off the ground when it's whipped. They are able to reply with such clever thoughts and their words are as threatening as their actions at times. Mr White and Mr Pink had the best back and forth conversations by far. The story is kind of a bottle movie with a bunch of flashbacks and that makes it all the more interesting to me. How they are all reacting within hours of the traumatic experience they went through makes their dialogue seem all the more powerful. The direction this movie takes is very well done and the way we learn about the characters seemed a bit forced with the flashbacks but I wouldn't cut it out of the movie at all. Mr Orange had a bit too long of a flashback though and I thought it could've made the film better focused if they had just talked some of it through with just Marvin. The story did seem to drag during the time of both Mr Blonde and Mr Orange's flashbacks and had to do some rushing, in my opinion, during the end. The ending to the movie was intense sure but after learning about these characters they just kind of all die (except Pink)  and we only learned the final details of the characters minutes ago! The best parts of this movie were the performances by the talented cast, the soundtrack from the 70's radio station, and the awesome scene with Mr Blonde and Marvin. That scene was so dark but just made the movie watchers aware of what these people aren't afraid to do. Reservoir Dogs shows that Tarantino can really direct a good movie and make himself known as one of the futures best Hollywood directors. I did have my problems with it but it still stands as a good movie.  C+",

Reservoir Dogs is a near perfect movie with amazing acting, directing, and writing. This film has great performances, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are all fantastic, this is a film that needed great performances and luckily there isn't a bad one. Quentin Tarantino fantastically directs this film, this was his first movie and he knocked it out of the park. The script is amazing, all the dialogue feels very natural and its amazing. This film is also pretty tense, the scene with Michael Madsen torturing the co is a really intense scene. This film is jam packed full of 80's songs and they are all great and fit in very well. I think Steve Buscemi gives a great performance and he's probably my favourite character in the film. This movie is full of iconic scenes like the badass slow motion walk, or the scene where they all get their code names, or the one with Tim Roth telling the story. This film has a fantastic ending and wraps everything up very well. This is a great and very well paced movie and one of the best ever made. A+",

Yes that's right folks, I just compared Quentin Tarantino to William Shakespeare, and I don't feel the least bit guilty about that. Try to tell me the dialog in Reservoir Dogs isn't memorable. That the opening conversation about the meaning of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' and the reason Mr. Pink doesn't tip isn't permanently seared into the brains of anyone who saw and loved this film.\n\nThis tale of a bank heist gone horribly wrong has it all. Friendships, betrayal, murder, blood, cowards, psychos, torture and heroes. Filled with ugly nasty characters that we can't take our eyes off, and told in a non-linear fashion that's both entertaining and very easy to follow. The story expertly develops its key players, and gives its cast the space to inhabit their characters and deliver great performances.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThe plot in Reservoir Dogs is dispensed in a non-linear way, meaning, this film jumps forward and back through the story's time-line. The film is also very violent in places, but some of the worst acts are insinuated rather than shown.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is nicely shot, but any sized screen is probably going to service this film well enough. Just make sure you can hear all the great dialog!\n\nBest Moments:\n\nThe opening scene where the guys are having breakfast. Mr. Blonde's time with the cop listening to K-Billy's 'Super Sounds of the Seventies.' Mr Orange's commode story preparation and execution, and when the guys all get assigned their aliases - plus many more!\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/reservoir-dogs-1992/\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

The action revolves around a single event, but one that we ultimately do not see in its entirety. Instead the story is gradually built by looking at each character and their activities. We quickly gain an understanding of each character and the part they had to play in the heist.

Just good old fashioned killing.\n\n No spoilers, the story is about a group of men who are pulling off a bank heist. But when it goes terribly wrong, they think they have a rat working for the police in their midst. This is followed by paranoia, suspicion, and rage. (I didn't differ very much from the IMDb description, so I don't believe any spoilers were revealed.) This story is very captivating, and the actors make it that way with no-bull performances. Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn were all in the early stages of their acting careers, and this movie was their big break. In fact, if Harvey Keitel hadn't agreed to produce it and star in it, it probably wouldn't have even seen the light of day; or at least it wouldn't have been as big as it is now.\n\n The script is very compelling and stylish. It gives a certain edge to the movie that made it better. A lot of this movie's dialogue has been quoted many times. My point- it was a very memorable movie.\n\n Overall, you have to see Reservoir Dogs. It is a timeless classic that defined Tarantino movies for the rest of his career.",

            "content": "Reservoir Dogs is the debut film from Quentin Tarantino and I can definitely say that he is definitely a dime a dozen. Tarantino was bold with making his debut film so unique from the it's competitors at the time.\n\nReservoir Dogs is written by Tarantino and Roger Avary contributing some dialogue for the film. What Tarantino has written is a twist of a staple story in the crime genre, where the events of the actual robbery is not seen but rather shine a light the events after the robbery. Tarantino could have kept it with that road but instead the film flips back and forth between origin/specific robbery stories and the post-robbery events. The film is driven by dialogue, which is now considered a principle in his films, and the dialogue is definitely different from crime films that preceded this film. Instead of physical actions and deep insight of the character's emotional core, characters are instead shaped by Tarantino's dialogue with characters speaking about themselves or others which in turn shapes our perception of these characters, which I think is important in order to view the plot objectively and not gain a deep attachment to these characters. The issues I had with his script is the underwhelming origin stories that doesn't really show off the wildness and absurdity that is found with many of his future films. The screenplay also felt a little held back on pushing the boundaries of the dialogue when compared to his succeeding films.  The dialogue also from time to time jump from being a natural and organic conversation, regardless if they are in a crisis situation, to basic plot driving dialogue.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is an amazing director and even though all of his films are not always in excellent condition, though his worst are miles better than most films it competes with, he still brings a sense of style that defines the film and it's fresh unique take allows us to be curious on what could come on the next scene. Reservoir Dogs is his first film which is the main reason why this film felt a bit rushed or amateurish, not in a bad way but rather in an inexperienced way. The film definitely is limited by a budget and that in a way restricted Tarantino, as he seems to show more crazy and fun sequences when he has the budget for it. The film for the most part keeps me interested with it's great pace and it's characters play with his dialogue, though Mr Orange's backstory did feel tiresome and did feel like walking through a mountain after the swift two thirds of the film. The film's non-linear approach does kind of play off the style that Kubrick applied for The Killing.\n\nAndrzej Sekula is the cinematographer for this film and he returns again in Tarantino's sophomore film. Sekula and Tarantino felt like they were held back in this film due to the budget therefore the film felt like it has this rushed hand held style that a lot of the moments of the film contains but this film does show hints of the photography style that Tarantino employs in his future films, with crooked angles, long takes and long shots of dialogue-full moments allowing the film to feel like a play, which is obvious in this film due to it's budget and boxed story.\n\nThis film doesn't include a score and this does in a way allow the film to suffer with moments that felt overstretched and needed that cinematic flair. Pulp Fiction also has these features but it makes up for it by having a sufficient amount of musical nuggets throughout the film that keep it from being stale. Though the musical moments that do cameo in this film are top notch with moments that actually feel more gruesome and horrific than what it already is.\n\nReservoir Dogs' cast is confined to 10 people and they are given the majority of the screen time, and it most cases it is shared.

            "content": "Reservoir Dogs is the debut film from Quentin Tarantino and I can definitely say that he is definitely a dime a dozen. Tarantino was bold with making his debut film so unique from the it's competitors at the time.\n\nReservoir Dogs is written by Tarantino and Roger Avary contributing some dialogue for the film. What Tarantino has written is a twist of a staple story in the crime genre, where the events of the actual robbery is not seen but rather shine a light the events after the robbery. Tarantino could have kept it with that road but instead the film flips back and forth between origin/specific robbery stories and the post-robbery events. The film is driven by dialogue, which is now considered a principle in his films, and the dialogue is definitely different from crime films that preceded this film. Instead of physical actions and deep insight of the character's emotional core, characters are instead shaped by Tarantino's dialogue with characters speaking about themselves or others which in turn shapes our perception of these characters, which I think is important in order to view the plot objectively and not gain a deep attachment to these characters. The issues I had with his script is the underwhelming origin stories that doesn't really show off the wildness and absurdity that is found with many of his future films. The screenplay also felt a little held back on pushing the boundaries of the dialogue when compared to his succeeding films.  The dialogue also from time to time jump from being a natural and organic conversation, regardless if they are in a crisis situation, to basic plot driving dialogue.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is an amazing director and even though all of his films are not always in excellent condition, though his worst are miles better than most films it competes with, he still brings a sense of style that defines the film and it's fresh unique take allows us to be curious on what could come on the next scene. Reservoir Dogs is his first film which is the main reason why this film felt a bit rushed or amateurish, not in a bad way but rather in an inexperienced way. The film definitely is limited by a budget and that in a way restricted Tarantino, as he seems to show more crazy and fun sequences when he has the budget for it. The film for the most part keeps me interested with it's great pace and it's characters play with his dialogue, though Mr Orange's backstory did feel tiresome and did feel like walking through a mountain after the swift two thirds of the film. The film's non-linear approach does kind of play off the style that Kubrick applied for The Killing.\n\nAndrzej Sekula is the cinematographer for this film and he returns again in Tarantino's sophomore film. Sekula and Tarantino felt like they were held back in this film due to the budget therefore the film felt like it has this rushed hand held style that a lot of the moments of the film contains but this film does show hints of the photography style that Tarantino employs in his future films, with crooked angles, long takes and long shots of dialogue-full moments allowing the film to feel like a play, which is obvious in this film due to it's budget and boxed story.\n\nThis film doesn't include a score and this does in a way allow the film to suffer with moments that felt overstretched and needed that cinematic flair. Pulp Fiction also has these features but it makes up for it by having a sufficient amount of musical nuggets throughout the film that keep it from being stale. Though the musical moments that do cameo in this film are top notch with moments that actually feel more gruesome and horrific than what it already is.\n\nReservoir Dogs' cast is confined to 10 people and they are given the majority of the screen time, and it most cases it is shared. The actors do play off well with each other and along with the strong dialogue it makes the film entertaining. The standout actors in this film is Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen, when they are bantering they all just bring the intensity that the scene required and are able to stay strong and fresh in long takes that includes monologues and subtle physical acting. Tim Roth was a bit of a distraction though, his American accent and the slight over the top acting did have me cringing.\n\nTarantino's debut does bring something unique and fresh to the crime genre but with an underwhelming screenplay and the inexperience and budget constriction does bring the film down.",

            "content": "The standard ingredients of a Quentin Tarantino film are cultural stream-of-consciousness dialogue, frequent usage of the words \"fuck\" and \"nigger,\" non-linear storytelling, obscure references to an older culture (primarily, the seventies), and a small appearance by the director and screenwriter himself. Tarantino's first major motion picture, Reservoir Dogs, is more than an adequate example of this. The characters and plot: Mr. White (Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Madsen), Eddie (Chris Penn), Mr. Pink (Buscemi), Joe (Tierney), Mr. Blue (Bunker), Mr. Brown (Tarantino), and Mr. Orange (Roth) (all white and male, incidentally) are in a one-job gang of robbers set up for a diamond heist, which quickly goes wrong when the police appear on the scene. Some of the members suspect that there is a snitch in the team. There is not much else to say without spoiling the film, which goes to show how great of a storyteller Tarantino can be. Just like the various gang members, Tarantino has a simple and familiar story to tell. It is the narrative structure and attention to details that stand out.\n\nNearly all of the characters each have a moment to shine. Mr. Blonde is a sadist who tortures a cop while dancing to Stealers Wheel's \"Stuck in the Middle.\" Mr. Brown suspects that the meaning of \"Like a Virgin\" is that Madonna has met a man who hurts her through sex-that is, painful penetration. Mr. Pink does not tip servers because he sees nothing so special in the job that it deserves a tip. Most of the conversations are seemingly idle, but prove to be very revealing, one essential to the induction of one member, by the end of the film.\n\nI mentioned a diamond heist. You never see it. You see much of what happens before and after the heist, but never the heist itself. The action is still exciting, before and after you realize what is going on in the film (particularly the aforementioned torture scene). The first scene shows the whole gang in a diner, dressed in suits, not talking at all of who they are or the heist. They exit the diner. The next scene, Mr. Orange is in the back of a car with a bullet in his gut, while Mr. White hastily drives him back to the hideout. Unless someone told you about Reservoir Dogs in explicit detail, you need your full attention on the script to understand anything about what is happening in the moment, what happened before, the characters' intentions, and the relationships between characters. Once your attention is paid, Reservoir Dogs rewards you with stylish odes to 1970s action films and very funny dialogue.",

This is the story of a group of criminals whose plan for a bank robbery goes tits up. This group of characters, who dress the same way and call each other by colours would appear two dimensional yet their ramblings reveal them as original and interesting individual - this factor itself is enough for Tarantino to knock a conventional element of many gangster films that preceded his first feature work. All this is rounded up by the star studded cast's excellent fun and appropriately colourful performances, out of which the cynic Keitel and the whiny Buscemi particularly shine.

The six men are hired by one man with his son as his partner. They all know someone tipped off the police about their planned robbery but their not sure. Two of them die right away with the other four hiding out in an abandoned garage with a kidnapped police officer. Two of them are trying to keep their cool, one other's intentions are to torture the kidnapped cop, and the last one is dying from a gut wound.\nThis film is intense basically from the outstanding performances that are given, from Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and especially Harvey Keitel.\nThis film could quite possibly be adapted into a staged play and it would be just as fantastic.\nI was watching this film with my floor mates in college and most of them said it was boring. They were hoping for more, plus we just watched Pulp Fiction last week.\nMe and some other guy seemed to agree that we liked this film.\nI love this film. This film makes me like Steve Buscemi more and I'm glad to see he made something of himself before Adam Sandler \"adopted\" him. But now it looks like he's getting his career back with Boardwalk Empire.\nThis film also makes me appreciate Harvery Keitel. The only other movie I saw him in before I saw Pulp Fiction was Little Fockers. Yea I know. lol.\nOverall, a well done piece of work that I greatly enjoyed.\nReservoir Dogs, I give you a 100%",

Quentin Tarantino takes a crime drama and transforms it into a fascinating character study of a group of very different guys, once with the same goal, now each attempting to figure out which member of their group is an undercover cop. The use of impressive cinematography and music create a unique tone of light mixing with dark. The characters are where this story really shines. Each character is their own person, and each actor presents them brilliantly. Though the characters may be hired for the same job, that doesn't mean they think the same way, or even get along for that matter. I found the confrontations between the characters to be just as intense as the action scenes. I'm not even going to say much about the action or violence because if your familiar with Tarantino, you know what to expect, (it's presented brilliantly). This movie is one you talk about. You need to watch it more then once to truly understand all the intricacies behind it all. If you're a fan of movies in general, this is a must see!",

            "content": "First ever review. Hold tight ladies and gentlemen because there will be more to come.\r\n\r\nAh, good old Quentin Tarantino. Never changing. Always seems to save us from the shit storm of terrible movies that we have to endure every year. Django Unchained being his latest, which was of course, fan-fucking-tastic. But, alas, I am getting carried away with Tarantino.\r\n\r\nOnto the actual film. It doesn't take a God to figure out that this is a character-driven movie. Don't get me wrong, the plot is entirely there, but the characters are what truly form this golden masterpiece. The way we see every character interact with each other in this \"whodunnit\" type of movie makes it all worthwhile. We get to see them all scramble with the notion of impending doom heading their way as they realize that one of them is an undercover cop. Each and every one of them are dead set on finding this cop. And the way Tarantino sets it up is absolutely ingenious. \r\n\r\nOf course my favorite has to be Mr. Pink, he is also a favorite among many fans. Steve Buscemi shined in this film, and for me, this was one of his best roles ever. Mr. Pink is the first one who came up with the thought that one among them was an undercover cop. The way Mr. Pink analyzes the situation and carefully deconstructs and constructs it all to be able to see that something was wrong helped form his character as this was done in the beginning. His smarts, curiosity, and general common fucking sense helped save himself from the bloodbath that was to come. Mr. White is a fucking idiot. Or that's what most people probably see when they see the movie. He had a fucked up judgement on what was right and wrong. He told Mr. Orange his real fucking name, I mean after repeated times on being told not to, Mr. White told his name. And then defending the dying Mr. Orange made the whole matter worse. Although I'll give it to him the way he killed Eddie and Joe was pretty fucking cool. And his escape was bad ass. But in no way, is he the Wolf like he is in Pulp Fiction. His lack of judgement made him much worse than the Wolf. Mr. Blonde is too fucking crazy for me. I mean, way too fucking crazy. The torture scene speaks for itself. Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue were utter failures, but of course they were because one was Tarantino (He's a fan of being killed in his own films) and the other had failure written across his face (He was old, even older than me.) Eddie was a comical guy, I can't help but smile when he tells his stories. Joe is an annoying shit. \r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, Mr. Orange. The infamous Mr. Orange. Tim Roth did a great fucking job making me writhe in my seat, because in most of the film he was shot. And the way he cried in agony and pain was just fantastic. His character was that of a typical big hotshot of a cop, ready to go undercover, but when shit hits the fan, he quickly shells up and pretends he's not there. \r\n\r\nBut the best part for me was the ending. The way Mr. White was destroyed when Mr. Orange said, \"I'm the cop.\" was priceless.\r\n\r\nThe screenwriting was masterfully crafted (It's Quentin fucking Tarantino), the direction was top notch (It's Quentin fucking Tarantino), the music was quirky and great (Stuck In The Middle With You and Mr. Blonde combined? Symphony bitches, symphony) and the thrills were thrilling (Play on words, bitches).\r\n\r\nIn a short way to sum this classic up: The characters and their interactions are the reason why this movie is a God damn motherfucking classic.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.: Titty sprinkles.",

It's a film where we mostly have nameless characters at first, but we start to learn things about them like Mr. White. I love this style of story telling and sometimes we learn things through dialogue only at times. When they show past scenes they always reveal something you weren't expecting like how Mr. Orange actually got shot. The majority of the film takes place after a robbery went bad as these mobsters are suspecting there was a snitch. For a film that may sound pretty simple it's amazing how many turns there can be. There were moments where I was surprised to see what connected to what or what ended up to be the truth. The film even carries some simple laughs which is always good for these movies as they express many different emotions other than suspense. Overall though this is a landmark film for it's high suspense, masterful story telling, and near perfect directing. This may not be my all time favorite Tarantino film, but a lot of films are great so it's hard to compare them.",

            "content": "You might think I?m a crazy, but I?m not really a big fan of Quentin Tarantino films. I don?t think they?re that great. I KNOW! I KNOW! PLEASE DON KILL ME! JUST HEAR ME OUT! HEAR ME OUT! Listen, it?s not that I don?t like Tarantino?s style or writing; it?s just that each of the movies he?s made has a flaw in it. Every Tarantino movie I?ve seen has some distinct problem with it that I don?t like. Kill Bill Volume 1 had so much action and violence, but there was no plot line and the style was a bit stupid. Kill Bill Volume 2 had an interesting plotline, but not as much top notch action as the first. Inglorious Basterds was fantastic until the end, which was really underwhelming in a way and it was sort of ridiculous. Django Unchained also was really long and sort of over welcomed its stay. Tarantino?s style isn?t really my thing. His style is sort of cartoony and it really takes me out of the dramatic aspects of his movies. I could not take Kill Bill seriously because of how cartoony and silly it was. My relationship with Tarantino is just like my relationship with Martin Scorsese; they both make movies that EVERYONE loves but I don?t like. But, thankfully, I finally saw Reservoir Dogs. Now this is the movie that actually got me to LOVE Tarantino. SO far, Scorsese hasn?t made one which hits it for me, but Tarantino punched me with this film, and I fell in love. Usually great directors have sucky first films, but Tarantino?s first is the best in my opinion. \r\n  \r\n   Reservoir Dogs is about a group of bank robbers who try to a find a mole in their team when a job goes terribly wrong. The beautiful thing about this film is, they never show the robbery. The entire film is based before and after the robbery, and I was still intrigued the entire time. It stars Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. The acting is outstanding across the board. Harvey Keitel gives a stellar performance as Mr. White (Breaking Bad anyone?). He?s stylish and chill but he has tiny bursts of anger which are truly powerful. He?s your protagonist and you?re supposed to root for him, and his cool attitude helps you respect and love this guy. Tim Roth is also fantastic playing Mr. Orange. He?s beaten down in the film and the suffering this man shows is outstanding and almost heartbreaking. Tarantino is, surprisingly, good in this movie. He?s in the film for mostly the first scene, but he shows that he not only can direct, he can act pretty well also. Granted he?s acting exactly like himself, he?s still pretty good.  Chris Penn is probably the weak link for me. He was a bit annoying at times and his accent seemed overdone. Steve Buscemi is definitely my favorite as Mr. Pink. He?s basically the man keeping everything under control, but he?s crazy himself also. Buscemi is so funny and he says his lines perfectly, showing such good comedic timing and portrayal. \r\n   \r\n   Tarantino?s style and direction is awesome in this movie. He doesn?t really go all out with swift camera movements and goofy captions like in his later films. He still has some great stylistic shots which give a spaghetti western vibe. I love the opening scene where the camera is slowly paning behind the characters. They?re in a discussion and everything in the entire shot is out of focus except their faces which is barely seen. You?re fully invested in what each person is saying because you?re trying very hard to notice the characters. It?s a brilliant trick that?s been done plenty of times before but really works with Tarantino?s smart dialogue. The style for this film is also very cool. Right after the opening scene, all the characters walk out of the caf\u00e9 and their shot in is stop motion. The style here works because of the completely opposite filming technique. The juxtaposition helps give a fresh take on both the scenes and makes you pumped to move on. Tarantino has a great way of writing dialogue. He doesn?t write to keep the plot moving, he writes to keep the characters more interesting and help us learn about them. He gives the characters normal conversations which are also interesting and very funny at the same time. There are at least 30 lines I could quote from this film. Tarantino?s nonlinear storytelling is actually perfect.  The curiosity keeps you on your feet the entire time and the way the story is unfolded never gets you bored. Tarantino is at his best in skillful direction. One scene has Tim Roth in a bathroom and the way it is cut and shot is so quick and fast that you?re amazed by the pulpy rush of the scene. That one scene stole the entire film for me. \r\n  \r\n   Grit and pulpiness is really highlighted through the film. There?s a lot of blood and violence that it?s almost overpowering. But it?s so AWESOME! There?s also a torture scene which gets really hard to stomach down, yet that?s what makes the film so great. Tarantino takes so many risks for a first film that I?m surprised Pulp Fiction wasn?t as harsh as this movie. When a film makes you squirm in your seat and literally shout at the screen to stop but you?re still having a great time watching the movie, that?s when it accomplishes something no other motion picture has done before. The mystery with the mole is so engaging and it made me think and kept me invested in the film. It?s a device used to keep you curious and thoughtfully engaged. This film is nonstop heart pounding exhilaration from the beginning of the movie to the very end. Oh is the ending SO good! I loved the ending and it was perfect! No other way it could?ve ended! The final shot is memorable and emotional at the same time! I was in awe once the film ended and it kept me in awe hours later. Reservoir Dogs has literally no problems except for Chris Penn?s ridiculous accent and the quick ending. It should?ve been a bit longer because the movie just ended all of a sudden and I was left a bit cold. Still, Reservoir Dogs is a great robbery film with wonderful characters and memorable dialogue. I loved it and it is Quentin Tarantino?s best movie to date and one of my favorite movies of all time. \r\n\r\nRecommendation: Reservoir Dogs reaches the heights of Pulp Fiction, if not exceeds it, so you better watch it right now because this film is definitely for the Tarantino fan and the hardcore movie lover.",

Reservoir Dogs never shows the actual heist, but alludes to it numerous times in the film to let the audience member imagine it for themselves, which surprisingly works to its favor.  Director Quentin Tarantino elected on a much more non-liner structure, which works perfectly and is easy to follow.  The characters themselves are very great and each bring a different personality to the film and make it better, easily the acting is the best part of the film.  The story again is incredibly brilliant, but has its fair share of slightly dull moments, but is still great from beginning to end.  Writing is good ,and at times perfect, but mostly for me at least wasn't as impressive as the acting and story.  Tarantino himself puts on a great low budget and short show that is constantly interesting to watch.

            "content": "The first thing that occurred to me after having finished watching 'Reservoir Dogs' was that it had some qualities that reminded of '12 Angry Men,' with whodunnit scenario and especially the economical approach to the movie. When you have strong performances outweigh superficial methods to entertain the audience, you know you have something special going on with this film, especially with Tarantino's unique method of storytelling.\n\nThis may be a heist film, but instead it shows what happens before and after. Basically it deconstructs the whole scenario and seeing what goes on is pretty interesting to watch. The witty dialogue is the entertaining part of this movie and to me, that is more entertaining to watch than a bunch of explosions, as I feel this would not even fit in with the story here.\n\nIf you are a person who is dissensitized to movie violence (or in fiction, in general), you have to know that there is some graphic violence here, but it is not unnecessary violence that was plugged in for the sake of value. It perfectly depicts the brutality of the situation these characters have thrust themselves into.\n\nBut to sum up my review of the flick, 'Reservoir Dogs' perfectly shows Quentin Tarantino's trademark style of directing, with pop culture references, violence, black humor, and every vice thrown in. Tarantino really showed a huge transition with the follow-up, 'Pulp Fiction,' but don't get me wrong, whereas 'Pulp Fiction' felt more heavily layered, 'Reservoir Dogs' has its own unique sense of charm with its more minimalist approach and simpler story. This is a must-see for all movie lovers or anyone who appreciates a good story.",

The movie feels like a B-movie, because it takes place in three places. The acting is good, but none of the characters develop throughout the story or feel round. The story takes place in the events after a failed robbery. The story is simple in a boring way and the only thing that's holding it is Tarantino's slick direction. There are some throw-away characters, but the others each represent different characteristics found in most people. For instance, Mr, White is kind, compassionate, serious, and naive. \"Pulp Fiction\" is one of my favorite films of all time, \"Django Unchained\" is my favorite film of the decade, and \"Inglorious Basterds\" was my favorite film of 2009, but \"Resevoir Dogs\" is simply alright.",

            "content": "I said in my Pulp Fiction review that it was Tarintino at his best. I ever thought I would see him do better, but then I saw Reservoir Dogs. It's true that Res-Dogs came out before Pulp Fiction but I saw Res-Dogs after I saw Pulp Fiction. It was something I don't see in many movies, and that is that the storyline is very short and not much happens but the dialog is the force behind the story. Reservoir Dogs is an interesting movie and when I saw it the first time I almost watched it again, but it was 3am and I was tired. I actually started because I loved the first scene so much.\n\tAs I said, the dialog was outstanding in this movie. Tarantino knows how to write a script. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Joe, and Nice Guy Eddie are sitting in a restaurant in the opening scene. These men are all of the main characters and they are what the movie is built around. In the opening scene we come in mid conversation and they are talking about the meaning behind the song Like a Virgin, and it was interesting. The fact that anybody can come in mid conversation to start a movie and be entertained is impressive and isn't seen that often. Then it gets even better. Mr. Pink refuses to tip the waitress and an argument about tipping and if it's the right thing to do is funny and it fit so well. It made me rethink the idea of tipping but I still do it anyway. Finally the opening scene is ended with all the Reservoir Dogs walking in slow motion the strangest song but again, it works. That shot where they introduce credits of the actors and the title screen comes up is a classic.\n\tMy favorite character is easily Mr. Pink. Steve Buscemi blew me away with his performance. He is one of the most important characters and he is makes some of the greatest impacts. The basic story behind Res-Dogs is that Joe gets a group of people together to pull off the perfect robbery, but the plan fails when they find out a cop is undercover. Mr. Pink brings up the possibility of a rat and the ball starts rolling from there. Mr. Pink is the only character with a lot of mystery surrounding him. We don't get his origin story like we did with White, Blonde, and Orange and we don't know for sure what happens to him in the end. All of the characters get endings except for Mr. Pink and that makes me angry, but I love it at the same time. I wanted more of Mr. Pink but I also love how I don't know a lot about him.\n\tThe only flaw I see with Res-Dogs is the lack of chemistry between Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. The movie slows down and the conversation they have isn't that believable. What I mean is, you can tell they are acting and it took me out of the experience. They are talking about the possibility of a rat and even though the ending of the scene picked up I left it wanting a little more effort. Other than that the movie is incredibly predictable. I knew the basic premise of the movie was to find out who the rat was and when I saw who the actors were I knew who it was. After the opening scene in the restaurant and the opening credits I knew who it was. I predicted the big plot twist and surprise at the end and I knew who would live and who would die. I wasn't 100% accurate, but I basically nailed the movie before I saw it. Even though I predicted it I still wanted to see it happen and the fact that I still loved it says something.\nI like to talk about my favorite scene in my reviews and my favorite is when Mr. Blonde goes nuts and tortures the cop. Mr. Blonde is an interesting character and his actions are disturbing but at the same time funny. He tortures a cop just because he is a cop and he doesn't care about what the cop knows. That is disturbing. However, he tortures him while the catchiest song is playing on the radio. There is a radio station that plays 70s music all day and it's mentioned a lot by other characters. The music in Res-Dogs is unlike any other movie, most Tarantino movie are, but this is different. In this scene with Mr. Blonde, the radio is playing but he goes out to his car and the music stops. It is supposed to mean the radio is out of hearing range and when he comes back in the building we can hear it again. Little things like that make this movie what it is.\n     Overall, Reservoir Dogs is a Tarantino movie so that means it is something special. Let's go down the WillyT Checklist. Awesome character. Check. Awesome Music. Check. Interesting story. Check. Strong opening that got me hooked. Check. Res-Dogs is blueprint Tarantino and got his name out there. It didn't necessarily put him on the map but it got enough publicity and made enough of an impact to make Pulp Fiction. Tarantino does what he wants, when he wants, and thank god for his films. Reservoir Dogs proudly gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. I loved the movie, I think I liked it better than Pulp Fiction. I watched it again a week after I saw it the first time and it was just as good if not better. In fact, I might go and watch it again right now. So, for right now, WillyT OUT!",

(It's funny to say, but Christopher Nolan should have learn from Tarantino's mistake, the cast is eye-candy, but the story is what has to be intriguing and worth watching)\nI found this to be one of the most boring films ever made... Just like most of Tarantino's films. Adding humor to a soulless body makes it a complete crapfest. It's all monologues (Which Buscemi's Mr. Pink made the best ones and he was by far the best thing to watch in this bore of a movie.) and no coherence. People arguing on who ratted who and then by the halfway point, he ruins the intrigue to find out who it was by deliberately showing who he was. Talk about buzz kill. This is the start of re-runs movie for Tarantino as most of his movies are about revenge, but in a different setting. (Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained and Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2)\nSo epic and masterfully done revenge movies, like 2013's 47 Ronin, gets chewed up for having nothing positive and being atrocious, yet it was greater than all of his movies combined as it was fresh and an innovative way to tell a revenge story. Tarantino-nites should get their head out of QT's ass and realize that his films are simply crappy, uninspired and redundant.\nAll of his movies have 1 or maybe 2 actors that make the movie barely watchable : Chris Penn and Steve Buscemi in Reservoir Dogs; Sam Jackson in Pulp Fiction, Lucy Liu and a little of Uma Thurman in Kill Bill; Brad Pitt, Christopher Waltz and Michael Fassbender in Inglorious Basterds (Pitt's performance overshadows anything and everything QT has ever done) and Leo DiCaprio and Sam Jackson (Again) in Django Unchained. Those lone bright spots are the only reasons why these movies are watchable just once. To watch them again would simply be torture. And excessive monologues get tiresome and very boring.",

Which is what makes Quentin Tarantino stand out from the rest of the crowd.  He brings to the table his own type of filmmaking that few others attempt.  \n\nThe acting in this movie is absolutely fantastic.  The two standouts are two of the main characters, Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel.  The first scene after the title sequence between the two of them is great.  The emotion, the dialogue, everything.  When Mr. White holds Mr. Orange in his arms when he's bleeding out actually kind of struck an emotional string in me.  Steve Buscemi is fantastic as always.  \n\nIt's so fun to watch all of the biggest aspects of Tarantino films brought to the big screen for the first time.  First is the dialogue.  Long scenes of ranting that sometime have nothing to do with anything, yet you're so interested in the characters you never lose focus of them regardless of what they are saying.  And of course it's not Tarantino without constant profanity.  But we can all agree that's just his style.  And I love it.  Because, in my opinion, that's actually what happens.  Second is the blood.  Now there isn't as much action in this movie, but that doesn't mean that he can't put his signature mega-blood into the film.  Any gunshot would and these dudes are spewing.  And it's great.  \n\nOf course I'm bias.  Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director of all time.  But no one can deny the beauty that is 'Reservoir Dogs'.  It's an absolutely fantastic independent film and the impressive beginning to Tarantino's acclaimed career.  It's just pure fun to see where it all started with this man and how you can notice all of the styles which you see in all his films these days.  A great movie from a great director.",

But the plot, unlike every other Tarantino film I have seen, is severely lacking.  The best scene in the movie is definitely the very first scene in the restaurant.

Quentin Tarantino becomes an overnight success as he writes and directs his first feature film. The story consists of the incidents before sand after but not during a bank robbery and is like no other heist movie. The cast is bursting with talent and is one of the strongest assembled casts I can think of in a debut feature.\n\nHarvey Keitel carries the story brilliantly as Mr. White and gives one of his best performances. Tim Roth plays Mr. Orange and his performance in this film is my favourite of his. All of his scenes with Harvey Keitel are brilliantly perfomed. Michael Madsen gives the performance of his spiralled out of control career as Mr. Blonde. His scene where he torchers the policeman whilst dancing to 'Stealers Wheels - Stuck In The Middle With You' is my favourite scene of film and one of my all time favourite movie moments.\n\nSteve Buscemi is great comic relief as Mr. Pink and shares some great scenes with Harvey Keitel. Lawrence Tierney, Chris Penn and the Director himself Quentin Tarantino all give fine performances also. One of my favourite scenes of the film is the opening when the whole group are in the diner together and are discussing tipping waitresses whilst Tarantino waffles on about Madonna's song Like A Virgin. The dialogue is random and pointless, but is bizarlely throuroughly entertaining and it opens the film brilliantly.\n\nThis none linear piece is some of Tarantino's finest work. The script is magnificent, the characters are individually and collectively brilliant and the casting is perfect. The violence is chilling and full of suspense and the story telling and concept is refreshingly original. Reservoir Dogs was a strong platform for Tarantino to build his career on, and twenty years on it still holds its own as a brilliant piece of film making.",

That's not something i subscribe to (for example The Godfather' another of those films i'm suppose to like is just good, ok.)But with 'Reservoir Dogs' i genuinely loved it.\r\n\r\nA different take on the classic bank robbery caper. There's nothing from the robbery itself but rather the aftermath and the set-up. A brilliant idea that could have created a terrible goring mess of a film. But under 'Quentin's' direction and quick snappy writing it's full of (now) memorable scenes. The 'Little Green Bag' walk and the famous Mr.Blonde dance.\r\n\r\nIt shows more of a character examination rather than a robbery film. It looks at the aftermath and the view points of different people from a botched bank job - as well as how they all got together. After what i consider to be a prologue it kicks off straight in the action with Mr.Orange shot and badly bleeding with Mr.White taking him to the safe house. But you don't know the situation how it happened all you know is what these characters are telling you - can they be trusted? who knows. But things are revealed constantly it's a gradual learning process. And by the end you don't know who you hate and who you like everything's a blur.\r\n\r\nI love the process of learning each characters story and a bit of a back story - a minimal back story. It's darkly funny sometimes, not to the same level as his latest films but it's obvious. The best thing is if you put this film in the middle of all of 'Quentin's' film you wouldn't know the difference it doesn't look like a director finding his feet.\r\n\r\nThere's lots to examine in this film its a great character study, a unique twist on the bank job film and its memorable scenes galore. it started his career off and is no doubt a classic. It may put people off with its violence but it's their lose a fine film.",

Although not my all-time favorite from Tarantino (that would be Inglourious Basterds), I do believe that Reservoir Dogs is his most well-made film.  It is a truly awesome viewing experience that ranks somewhere in my top 20 favorite films of all-time.  \n\nThis is a unique story that shows the events that take place before and after a botched robbery.  Gangster Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) organizes the crime, putting together five different men who he has hired to carry out the plan.  Things go wrong when the group runs into police who are anticipating the robbery, which means one of them is a rat.  The film jumps between pre and post-crime,  showing how the group deals with the failed plan and the events that lead up to.\n\nThe performances here are incredible.  Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, and Lawrence Tierney are all outstanding.  Unlike most of Tarantino's other work, Reservoir Dogs has a fairly average run-time, meaning it's right to the point and grabs your attention immediately at the first scene.  That being said, the shorter length doesn't compromise Tarantino's dialogue, which is always so good.  You really get an understanding of all these characters and their different personalities, which makes for a truly fun ride.  As I said, I think Reservoir Dogs still holds up as Quentin Tarantino's finest work.  It's a true cinematic achievement and the starting point for a legendary filmmaker.  5 stars.",

It shows deception and how when people feel threatened, they cannot trust anyone.. All the sub stories are really interesting. The main thing that made me love this movie is that it didnt actually show the robbery at all. This brings our imagination into the film and really engrosses us in the story. in my opinion, Tarantinos best film",

Reservoir Dogs is QT's kick off to a string of successful films during the 90's... including Jackie Brown and the legendary Pulp Fiction. Reservoir Dogs follows a vulgar-professional team of heisters as they attempt to pull off what seemed to be a simple robbery. This is a classic QT film filled with plentiful violence, plot twists, and sprinkle of dirty humor. So do us all a favor, and \"Cough up a buck you cheap bastard\", go rent this movie!",

It's the story of a jewelry heist gone wrong, and the effects surrounding the heist.  The first time I watched this, I watched with my parents and was absolutely amazed at what I saw.  As soon as the movie ended I knew Tarantino was my favorite filmmaker off just seeing one of his movies.  The way the movie looks, feels, sounds is just so fresh and I guess \"cool\" would be a perfect word.  The music is fantastic and the dialogue is just amazing.  I quote this movie all the time, and know quite a few people who do as well.  Plus, this has probably the great torture scene ever.  It's funny and truly terrifying at the same time.  It had bee probably 5 years since I watched this all the way through, and this movie holds up very, very well.  Re-watching this is like seeing your best friend from high school and just catching up.  Again, I LOVE this movie, and everyone I know that has seen this loves it also.  This is a must see, and probably in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.",
