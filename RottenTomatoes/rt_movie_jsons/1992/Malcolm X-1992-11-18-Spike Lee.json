I do have mixed feelings on Spike's direction here, though. On one hand he chose to start the biopic at near the beginning of Malcolm's life and to show the entire thing, leaving his hands somewhat tied in terms of how much screentime to give to each segment of Malcolm's life as he really did spend a full 12 years of his truncated adulthood with the Nation of Islam, but on the other Malcolm's life was cut short before he could spend longer espousing his later opinion that he had been wrong in some of his earlier beliefs about separatism and his blanket generalizations about all white people. Spike's choice to leave Malcolm's full speeches emphasizing the talking points that he personally agrees with and then basically paying lip service to the change of heart with very little runtime allotted paints an incomplete picture of who Malcolm really was at the time of his passing. Remembering him near-solely as a radicalized preacher of division & hatred is inaccurate & it betrays the notion that people can change and evolve despite that being a key plot point in the prison scenes.",

Denzel Washington, arguably in his best role, is nothing short of spectacular as Malcolm, playing each scene with steely passion.  Clocking in at about three hours, the film holds the viewer's interest over the first half as it examines the early life of one of the seminal figures of the civil rights movement, exploring the events that made him who he was.  However, the movie loses considerable steam over the second half as it seems to be filled with an unending series of inspirational speeches and press conferences.  Clearly, there is importance in explaining the ideology, but it all becomes a bit repetitive.  Regardless, this is an important film to watch.",

Opening his movie with zoot suits, fast talk and bright colors in 1940s Boston is quite different tonally from the gray and serious tones, black suits, and carefully articulated dialogue that becomes prevalent as Malcolm Little becomes Malcolm X. I also credit Lee for generally letting the onscreen action speak for itself, keeping characters from telling me what to feel or believe, and allowing audiences to come to their own conclusions.\n\nAs praiseworthy as Spike Lee is here in presenting his film, it never creates the impact that it does without one of Denzel Washington's career best performances. Captivating doesn't really define his portrayal of Malcolm X, which had a magnetic quality that somehow made a film this long seem half as as short. Washington really had to embody many roles for this part, as Malcolm X was constantly growing and changing, making the person he was depicted as in the first forty-five minutes of the film almost unrecognizable from the man he was still becoming at the conclusion.",

            "content": "Even with its epic scope, Malcom X remains focused (until the end) on one thing: the engaging, yet imposing performance of Denzel Washington as the historical figure. As the world around him changes, both his immediate surroundings and the entire country, we witness Malcolm's viewpoint and principles shift and develop as he is repeatedly forced to review himself and his beliefs, leading him to become a more understanding and thoughtful person. In the first stage of his life he's a rash kid who's interested in crazy clothes, white girls, and straightening his hair. This version of Malcolm is taken in by gambling and the world of crime. He's thoughtless and reckless but still clever. Director Spike Lee shoots the film almost like a Scorsese gangster movie with frequent scenes in smoky bars and even freeze frames with narration by Washington as Malcolm. The next stage of his life begins when he's thrown in prison but finds mental freedom as a Muslim. From then until the end, Malcolm is a devout follower of Islam and its teachings. He faithfully follows his religious leader, Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman Jr.), beginning each speech with, \"the honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us...\" even when his mentor is sitting silently on his thrown, basking in his glory and not seemingly teaching anything. Malcolm is apparently doing all the work but while he's receiving plenty of accusations and threats, he's giving away all the credit. Malcolm's wife, Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett), finally opens his eyes to the hypocrisy of his idol and Malcolm breaks away from the Nation of Islam. It still isn't until he takes a pilgrimage to Mecca that he can form his own honest beliefs on the condition of racism in America and the positive relationship African Americans should have with whites and among themselves. Spike Lee presents the power of religion and race to both unite and divide. Islam is shown to split even the black community as Malcolm criticizes other civil rights leaders, but it also brings people together under a common goal and belief system. Even when black Muslims are struggling to get the same treatment as whites, they are labeling women as property and concerning themselves with the heights of their \"mates.\" Malcolm also preaches that African Americans should remain independent of whites, even labeling all whites as evil, until he meets and prays with whites on his pilgrimage and sees that many of them aren't that different from him. In the end it's actually his own Nation of Islam that turns on him, after he's split it down the middle with extremist beliefs. Throughout sequences of Malcolm's time as a public figure, making speeches and taking trips, Spike Lee intersperses scenes with grainy, black and white footage of Washington as Malcolm, mimicking what would have been seen on the news at that time. This gives the story a sense of authenticity that greatly benefits it, but when it's time for Malcolm's assassination, Lee creates almost an action movie shootout that lacks the realism it needs to present the full impact of the historical event. After this, Lee continues to damage his message further by explicitly stating what an important person Malcom was through a eulogy by Ossie Davis and a talk by Nelson Mandela. This, along with pictures and clips of the real life Malcolm X, distract from and overshadow Denzel Washington's performance to which he devoted so much effort and care. Washington was Malcolm X, it was a biographical film not a documentary so it is through him that we should get the insight into the person that Malcolm was. And we do, but Spike Lee isn't confident enough in us or even in himself or Washington that we will understand his message.",

Denzel Washington delivers a performance full of heart and passion. Truly both Spike & Washington at the prime of their careers. There were times I was convinced I was watching the real Malcolm X many times in the film.\n\nFor a biopic, the plot will be straightforward. Yet, I found the dedication to each tiny detail in each era of Malcolm X's life was both painstaking and rewarding. The set designs, costumes, and music were all loyal to the sign of the times. The film also follows each stage of Malcolm X's philosophies without saying which is right or wrong. The film is well-rounded and makes its audience understand each decision made.\n\nThis movie is loyal to its source material and viewers can tell that Spike Lee did his research. It pushed boundaries as far as can be reasonably told in a three-hour movie. I also enjoyed the final montage as it showed Malcolm X's far-reaching impact. I was even surprised to see Nelson Mandela make a cameo in the film. You don't see that every day.\n\n4.5/5. A loyal and timeless classic from Spike Lee. Stellar performances by Denzel Washington and the crew. Doubt any other biopic about Malcolm X could top this.",

The journey of the protagonist depicted in here is a bit overstretched and not elaborated which comes off as a bit downer but since there is enough concrete material to feed the audience throughout the course of it, one can easily neglect it. \n\nIt is short on technical aspects like cinematography, background score, art design, sound department and editing although is rich on costume and production design. The writing follows a rudimentary process of a rigid structure that is extracted directly from the textbook, it lacks maturity and smarter approach. \n\nThe screenplay by Arnold Perl and Spike Lee is effective and creates a greater impact than anticipated among the viewers but unfortunately it also lags a lot. Spike Lee; the screenwriter and director, has done a tremendous work on executing the script on screen and it is undeniably Lee's feature as he speaks volume in every frame. The performance objective is taken hold by Denzel Washington with conviction and he does carry it all on his shoulder with head held high for around 200 minutes. \n\nMalcolm X is a process of suffering for attaining an uneven and imbalance state of peace that results in so latter, that the audience barely cares about the outcomes for they are having a time of their life encountering just the process.",

            "content": "Malcolm X is the greatest biopic ever filmed!\n\nSpike Lee directs his magnum opus with his 1992 movie Malcolm X. It is as poignant a movie and message as when it was first conceived. Lee brilliantly adapted Alex Haley's novel The Autobiography of Malcolm X thoroughly. Malcolm X is a wholly comprehensive look at the life of Malcolm X. We see his childhood, young adulthood, incarceration, reformation, epiphany, all the way up to his assassination. It is historically accurate, detailed, fair, and quite profound. I also continue to find this movie highly entertaining at all times. Please watch Malcolm X.\n\nSpike Lee's direction and creative visuals persist as some of the most innovative and immaculate cinematography and framing ever committed to film. Every scene has an interesting angle or perspective. So many cool panning shots and intense sequences. There are brilliant quiet moments filmed in a more intimate style, then boisterous scenes shot in a more wild style. Spike Lee proves his mastery as a director with Malcolm X.\n\nNotably, Denzel Washington delivers his absolute peak performance as an actor. Watching Washington embody the look, tone, complexity, and wisdom of Malcolm X is a delight. He captures every type of personality that Malcolm represented, while simultaneously demonstrating Malcolm X's bold presence. Washington plays him calm, cool, and collected. Malcolm X starts out misguided, but evolves into the ultimate orator, verbose in vocabulary, passionate in faith, and engaging in speech. It is a pleasure to witness Washington's acting as Malcolm X.\n\nA number of brilliant supporting performances are contained within Malcolm X. I love Angela Bassett in this movie as Betty X. Delroy Lindo is excellent as the mobster Archie. Albert Hall is captivating as Baines. Al Freeman Jr. is truly haunting in his take as Elijah Muhammad. I actually really love Spike Lee's portrayal of Shorty. He gives as good a performance as Lee does in Do the Right Thing. Every gives their career best here. It's an impressive ensemble to say the least.\n\nIn all, Malcolm X is an important film for society's conscious, film history, Denzel Washington's career, and Spike Lee's filmography. It is also the most engaging and comprehensive biopic ever released. I think people everywhere will relate and understand Malcolm X more deeply than what they previously knew before watching the movie. I highly recommend this cultural classic of cinema. Malcolm X will astonish you!",

Won't lie it was the three hour and twenty minute run time that always threw me off because I knew I wanted to watch it fully through and not piece by piece. Well glad I did. Although it is slightly dated I found it very well done. Denzel Washington plays the title role of Malcolm X. The film is shown during his early life where he is a small town crook that gets busted. Malcolm experiences the racism from white people early on. His father was killed by the KKK, the judge gave him and his friend a huge sentence not even for robbing someone, but for sleeping with white women. While in prison Malcolm converts to Islam under the mentorship of a fellow inmate Baines (Albert Hall). Converting to Islam gives Malcolm a path and he soon join The Nation Of Islam leading his own crusade to bring about the equality and love for his people. The movie is well paced it fits in some flashbacks to go over Malcolm's early life and it never takes away from the plot moving forward. Denzel is fantastic as the lead. He brings about the character and the power behind his speeches and actions. Overall, really great movie and I'm glad to have finally watched it. The words of Malcolm X weren't always agreed upon by everyone, but his clear message of loving yourself and not changing to please someone else is something anyone can agree upon. Highly recommended.",

May I say the one scene I enjoyed more than most was a scene that had the usual Spike Lee shot to where it doesn't see something thats going on in reality but in the mind while the wonderful \"a change is gonna come\" by Sam Cooke plays. This movie is a masterpiece show how brutal America was back then. I think Spike did a amazing job with he blows being realer than most. The darkness of America back then is evil with the KKK, police brutality and the rise and fall of Civil Rights leaders when the black community rose up and said we have had enough mixed with beautiful camera work and a great meassage I suggest Malcolm X to anyone who can face the brutality of past America.",

            "content": "Now this is a way to do a biopic, 'Malcolm X' is an exceptional film that features one of Denzel Washington's best performances and is perfectly directed by Spike Lee. It feels almost like a clich\u00e9 to say that Denzel was good because he's always good and he always makes everything effortlessly watchable but he's scarily good in this and looks the part so much, you couldn't have gotten a better actor for this film and to that review, by Jonathan Rosenbaum,  that said he was miscast, what? You see footage of Malcolm X at the end and it just solidifies how much of an excellent job Denzel did. It is a performance for the ages that was unfortunately snubbed by a knock-on effect of previous Oscar snubs, I'm not saying that is a good excuse and talent isn't, or to some people- shouldn't, be judged by awards, but still, wow, what a shame. The film has an excellent cast that features some veterans as well and everyone does an excellent job, you really feel invested in its world and for a film that is as long as it is, it couldn't be any other way. It certainly is an ambitious film and it's a miracle Lee got it made but it paid off because it is a truly engrossing experience that earns its length and moves along perfectly. The structure of the film reminded me of, 'The Deer Hunter', which is, funnily enough, Lee's favourite film and the way everything develops is perfect and he tells the story the way it needs to be told. You go on a real epic journey during the course of this film and so much happens; Lee pulls no punches and tells it like it is, which is a great thing to see, especially in a biopic, and it is filled with so many iconic moments. I knew what happened to him before I watched it but I'm still surprised by who did it, I know the devastating conspiracy behind it all, but still, I thought it'd be white people when I first learned about him. I know he said he wasn't afraid but he should have moved! It's heartbreaking to watch.\n\nMy only real complaint is with some of the editing, sometimes it'll have a voice-over whilst having a conversation underneath but it wasn't used like how most implement it in their films with one audio track being quieter than the other or playing the tracks one at a time with breaks and it made it jarring because I was trying to listen to both at the same time, even if they spoke about the same thing. Also, it'd show a flashback to scene for a few seconds and then later on show us the full thing and I just found that odd, it also showed a flashback to something that happened in the past that was happening to the characters in the present and I recognised the similar scenario without feeling like I had to be retold. There was also a shot looking up from a piece of grass and it just made me think about props. I understand these are huge nitpicks but in a film that's as perfect as this, that's all I can say. And what else can I say that hasn't already been said? For a film that is as amazing as this one is, there really is no point to repeating myself. It's an intelligent, powerful, engrossing film that is an epic in the full sense of the word and totally earns it. THIS is Best Picture quality and should have been up for more awards, awards don't make a film but this is excellent. I'm so glad that I have finally seen it.",

            "content": "This is without a doubt one of the best films ever made. Denzel Washington gives without a doubt one of his best performances of all time as Malcolm X, the civil rights leader who was pro-violence against the white people during the civil rights movement before coming to his senses and realizing the Muslim religion he was so eager to lay his life down for was hypocritical and in some ways I felt used Malcolm X, or just got too jealous once his stature in the Muslim religious group was getting him so much attention that people believed he was the voice of Allah; not the honorable Elijah Muhammad. They turned on Malcolm X, just after he literally devoted his life for their cause because their religion helped him get sober, and allow him to find himself again before becoming just another degenerate in Harlem. Denzel literally is Malcolm X. Just like Daniel Day-Lewis was Lincoln, and like Sean Penn was Harvey Milk in Gus Van Zant's \"Milk.\" No one, and I mean no one could have had the strength and endurance to play Malcolm X as Denzel Washingoton did in this movie just makes me believe that Denzel is without a doubt one of the best actors that has ever lived. He's a fearless actor, the man has a true potential for acting. I mean come on the guy did not win his two Oscars for \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" for nothing. But there is something about \"Malcolm X\" that just hits you hard when you watch it, mostlt because Denzel is just so damn good throughout  the whole movie that he is truly the driving force behind this\nwhole movie. There are also great supporting performances by Delroy Lindo, the hoodlum gangster of Harlem, who takes Denzel's Malcolm X under his wing after he sees him smash a guys with a glass bottle after insulting him and making a comment about his mother which Denzel tells him ferociously to never say another word about his mother again. Albert Hall, who played the chief in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam achievement \"Apocalypse Now,\" is great as Bane, the man who shines the light onto Denzel's Malcolm X and converts him into the realm of Islam and helps him become a Muslim. And then there's Angela Bassette and even though they toned her looks down a little bit for the movie so she can look like a typical Muslim wife of Malcolm X, she still looks good and even today at 56 she still rocking it if you ask me. She gives a very, very strong performance as Malcolm X's wife and even though I have only seen a handful of her films, I find she delivers every time I see her in a movie. Even Spike Lee, the Director of this movie who I know is very controversial subject matter these days even bring a great presence as Malcolm X's hoodlum buddy in the film. This is a movie not be missed as I would definitely put it in my \"1001 Movies You Need To See Before You Die\" list and just want to say one more thing. This is the most historical bio I have ever watched and truly believe this was my first Denzel Washington movie and I remember even seeing \"Malcolm X\" at a young age when I believe it had just started coming on TV after being in the movies and thinking the whole time watching Denzel Washington in this movie that this is an actor I have got to keep an eye on as he is truly, TRULY a remarkable actor who I hope keeps bringing us more great performances for years to come. Also about Spike Lee, even though like I said before he is a controversial subject matter these days I will admit one thing, no one but him could have directed this movie as for a man of Spike Lee stature I would like to say this is his \"Goodfellas\" as nobody but him could have made a movie like this I truly applaud him for this was a very fierce movie to make and even though he was nominated for Best Director for this movie even though I feel he should have; Denzel Washington was able to execute Spike Lee's vision....and that's all that matters.",

Lee gives the story the epic delivery it deserves (the opening scene alone tells you're in for a big film) and while he veers close to being overly political (particularly the opening & closing scenes) he doesn't shy away from showing Malcolm's many faults, from his criminal past to his blind devotion to the Nation of Islam.

This is one of Spike Lee's best films! Spike Lee did a good job playing Shorty! Denzel Washington was perfect for playing Malcolm X! I love to see the two most beautiful women which is Angela Bassett(as Dr. Betty Shabazz) and Theresa Randle(as Laura). Wonderful job by Al Freeman Jr. for playing Elijah Muhammad\nGlad to see Delroy Lindo (as West Indian Archie) in this movie. The two well known veteran actors Roger Guenveur Smith(as Rudy) and Giancarlo Esposito(as Thomas Hayer) did their thing too! Also, Ernest Thomas(Sidney) from the 70's tv show \"What's Happening\" did a great job too! It was crazy to see Al Sharpton in this movie when he was fat.",

Plotwise, the film manages to balance the difficult task of demonstrating Malcolm's extremism and his compassion without seeming like there's any contradiction between the two. His basic journey is that of redemption, from a petty criminal in the first act to the influential spokesman of a religious sect in the second to an human rights activist promoting toleration and brotherhood in the final act. In fact, one of the great tragedies of his life is that he died just when he seemed to have found enlightenment but before he had much time to act on it. Malcolm seems to have spent his life improving himself and that provides the film with a curiously uplifting message.",

After director Norman Jewison left the project due to script problems, Lee signed up, and it was his most epic film to date, while Lee's films have an angry voice about them, this is a very respectful biopic, and the only angry voice is that of it's title character. Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) was a small time drug pusher and pimp in Boston in the 1940's known as 'Detroit Red', however Malcolm was sentenced to 8 to 10 years in prison for robbing the home of a rich white couple. In prison, Malcolm reads the bible and becomes a follower of the readings and teachings of black American religious leader Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman, Jr.), who takes Malcolm under his wing upon his release. Malcolm converts to Islam, and becomes Malcolm X, and he encourages blacks to stand up against the whites, but he soon becomes disillusioned with Elijah's teachings, and opts for a more peaceful activism. It's a very powerful film, and Lee captures the time period well, and Washington gives off a powerful and enigmatic performance. It might be a bit overlong, but it's a really captivating and is a good screen protrayal of one of the great activists of the 20th Century.",

But the fact is Malcolm X is a truly excellent historical figure, and the tale of holm that Spike Lee has directed is practically flawless. The acting, the emotion. The costume, the soundtrack, the terrific cinematic style and the general heart creates a spectacular retelling and educational piece about one of history's greatest heroes. Spike Lee has poured his heart out here for us and the result is the piece of a man's heart that we can all witness and enjoy: Malcolm X.\n\nDenzel Washington is the spitting image of Malcolm X here, through his look and his performance. This is Denzel Washington's greatest performance, as he can smile and get angry with us genuinely believing that he is feeling those emotions in the moment, and why wouldn't we?

No.  The lack of depth between Malcolm and wife Betty is a disadvantage, as is probing and explaining the wae between Malcolm and the Nation of Islam.  However, it is Denzel Washington, portraying the titular figure from youth to middle age, who shines.  Charismatic and stern at the same time, he is the epicenter of the film.  A lesser actor would have made this a glorified History Channel film.  Astute viewers of other Spike Lee films will notice some of the director's trademarks, especially in a scene near the finale (which also seems rushed, but no bother).",

With seemingly equal capacity for both love and vitriol, a film that tried to focus on one facet of his personality,  while consequently ignoring the many other ones that made this man so enigmatic, would feel dishonest. Lets face it, this film was bound to rustle some feathers, and I think it was a smart move to let the man speak for himself.\nAnd how could you review the film without mentioning the great Denzel? How he manages to pull off such a complex character with such ease is absolutely stunning. That he lost the Oscar to Pacino is still one of the most egregious crimes the academy has ever committed.\nWhile Lee's career may be wading in troubled water as of now, Malcolm X gives me hope that he will soon rebound.",

            "content": "I find it ironic that Denzel Washington is playing who is possibly the most iconic anti-integration black man in history, and next to Will Smith, he's the whitest black man in film, but hey, that only makes the film deeper and more provocative. Almost three-and-a-half hours, it better be provocative. After this, I better want to get plastic surgery to look black and then actually join the Black Panthers, which seems pretty possible, considering that by the time you finish watching this film, the universe will have already collapsed, reset and progressed to the A.D. 1960s again. I love how I'm griping about this film being so long, and it's only - no joke - the [b]\"eleventh\"[/b] longest film I've ever seen. Holy cow, I need some kind of a life, even if it can't be anything as extravagant as Malcolm X's life. Well, to be fair, Forrest Gump's life wasn't as eventful as Malcolm X's, partially because Gump was just some dumb guy that got caught up in some cool stuff, whereas Malcolm X was black \"and\" muslim, two people that were doing all kinds of crazy stuff between the '40s and '60s, so one can only imagine what you get when you cross them together. I guess you could say that if you crossed a black and a muslim, you would get \"Malcolm Little in the Middle\", and by extension, the inspiration for a pretty good film, which isn't to say that this film doesn't fall into one too many missteps here and there.\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna say that Malcolm X's life is underwhelming, but I'm not quite sure that the \"short\" version should be 200 minutes. Well, sure enough, although most of the film is tight, when it goes loose, it falls out, and you with it, because after a while, watching a bunch of black people dancing at a night club get unengaging enough, let alone when you're actually trying to tell a story so much that it eventually loses steam. Of course, what does more to damage this film isn't the looseness, but the tightness, as well as the style. The overstylized storytelling is at its worst during the flashbacks to Little's childhood, where things feel so devoid of genuineness, due to everything feeling so tacked-on and overwhelmed with histrionic energy, especially when it comes to the unbelievably overbearing score. Still, just because that's where the overstylizing is at its most intense, that doesn't mean that overstylizing doesn't plage much of the film, because there are countless moments of \"Wait what was that?\" or \"Wow, that just came and went\", and sure, it's not like a meditative film, where overstylizing taints the film's very aura and leaves it to limp along, almost entirely devoid of substance, but there are still too many moments theatrics, and it really intensifies the impact of the final blow that keeps this film from being truly impressive: Spike Lee's underwhelming execution. The film is well-produced, runs a mammoth length and is with a story so worth telling it's unreal, and the latter fact is one known too much by Spike Lee, so much so that even with all of the forced theatrics, he only wants to \"tell\" the story of Malcolm X, rather than revive it, which isn't to say that this film is totally vacant of emotion, but it is to say that the story structure is too conventional and safe to the point of being messy, leaving every transition in between arcs in Little's life - from his criminal life, his conversion to Muslim and, of course, his leadership of the Black Panthers - to feel inorganic and somewhat inconsistent, because Lee is so desperate to keep Little's story as faithful as possible that he forgets to truly captivate his audience, leaving the film to run on only so much juice. However, the film is nowhere near bad, for although Spike Lee's dream project is all but ruined by his dreaming just a little too big, it's still a fascinating story of a man's entire mindset changing as he goes from being a following nobody to a leading icon, and while it stands to be executed better, it's still an experience worth having, especially considering that, as I said, it's pretty darn well-produced.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the production designs so impressive is the fact that they are subtle, being elaborate enough for you to really see the time, yet pulled back enough for you to feel the time. There's no overemphasis on the '40s or '50s or '60s, let alone the transitions into all of them, yet they're reconstructed so fashionably, keeping you engaged in the time without it feeling as though it's interrupting the story, only supplementing it. The same can be said about the cinematography, which is subtle and graceful. True, early on, the overemphasis on lighting got to be a bit annoying, but on the whole, the cast of a shadow or a beam of light is played upon subtley, but noticably, and it really supplements the tone on many occasions. I must say that I absolutely dug such scenes as the prison solitary confinement sequence, which is illuminated only by what limited light is salvaged through the feeding doors, and it gives you such a perfect sense of isolation and claustrophbia that strongly reflects and symbolizes the anguish and pain that is falling upon the shoulders of Little, not just in that moment, but many others, which isn't to say that cinematographer Ernest Dickerson is the only one carrying scenes like that, because the real star of this show is, of course, Mr. Denzel Washington. Perhaps they could have done a better casting job for the sake of physcial authenticity, but when it comes to embodying such a layered soul as Mr. Malcolm, few people could do as good of a job as the great Denzel Washington, and sure enough, the atmosphere that Washington emits is powerful, whether he's portraying a hardcore criminal like Detroit Red, a searching soul like El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz or an influential leader like Malcolm X. Spike Lee's heart may be too much in the story for him to really deliver on it, but Washington is layered and riveting in his portrayal of this follower-turned-leader, and it's that portrayal, all but by itself, that makes this film consistently fascinating, compelling, borderline enthralling and genuinely worth watching, because for every occasion of momentary disconnect, it's hard to not find yourself quickly and frequently pulled back in by the subtlety, grace and transformation in Denzel Washington as he brings the iconic Malcolm X back to life.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day... or second, or third, or how ever many days it takes you to watch this film, it's hard not to feel a touch thrown-off by moments of overstylizing and looseness, but generally a bit disappointed by Spike Lee's overly conventional, overly safe, periodically inconsistent and ultimately underwhelming storytelling, but what keeps this film an ultimately rewarding one in spite of its flaws is, of course, it's compelling subject matter that is brought to life by subtlety and grace in the production, visual style, but most of all, Denzel Washington, who's layered, transformative and enthralling portrayal of this icon helps perhaps most of all in making \"Malcolm X\" a frequently and genuinely fascinating and enjoyable study on the life and times of the legendary Mr. Malcolm \"El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz\"/\"Detroit Red\"/\"X\" Little. Jeez, how many names did he have?\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

In Howard Zinn's 'A People's History' he makes the similar point about the dictionary definitions of black and white in the year 1500.  Spike talks about it in the 1950s.\n\nToday, the definition of white at dictionary.com reads, \"of the colour of pure snow.\"  Black reads as, \"Gloomy\" and \"Wicked\".

Washington, who is already one of my favorite actors and screen presences, delivers a captivating performance that manages to hold my interest for almost three and a half hours. To put that in perspective, the first Lord of the Rings movie, which is twenty minutes shorter, is a film that I can't make it all the way through, and it has a large ensemble of talented actors who perform perfectly well. The supporting performances are also quite good, especially Angela Bassett, who gives a criminally underrated and downright heartbreaking performance as Malcom X's long-suffering wife.\n\nThe film is not without it's flaws, and the last 20 minutes have a moment or two that have not aged as well as the rest of the piece, but it is a very impressive work overall and highly recommended viewing, particularly for those who have an interest in this era of history",

Its 3+ hour runtime makes it a bit daunting but is worth it if you do not know a lot about Malcolm X.  Coming into the film with a mere surface knowledge of his life, I was very surprised by Malcolm becoming a minister for the Nation of Islam and later being persecuted by them.  Denzel Washington is fantastic in the title role and was rewarded with an Oscar nomination, though his performance couldn't compare to Pacino in \"Scent of a Woman.\"  The most impressive thing about Washington's performance is the diveristy in characterization from criminal to convert to charismatic speaker.  The other actors are just pawns in the storytelling, since the script focuses so heavily on the main character.  The only other actor that stood out is Delroy Lindo, who radiates cool in any role.  \"Malcolm X\"s greatest asset and biggest downfall is its runtime, as every moment of the film is important and worthwhile but the length makes it impractical to watch unless you watch it in two parts; however, if you ever have 3 1/2 hours on your hands, this is worth your time.",

With the case of Malcolm X, he is suited for the job, but really, I think maybe Denzel Washington should have directed this as well as starred in it. What truly makes this film worth watching is Denzel Washington's performance as Malcolm X. He truly delivered something incredible on screen. However I also thought that the film felt too preachy and it started to sound like a Spike Lee rant after a while. As a person who's read Alex Haley's The Autobiography Of Malcolm X, I have to say that I much preferred the book to the film. I thought there was a lot more detail, and more interesting facts that Spike seem to leave out or twist to make his own point in telling Malcolm X's story.

A film that is not only a way for African-Americans everywhere to rightfully embrace their heritage, but a film that gives people of all creeds, races, and ethnicities a chance to realize that we can live in perpetual harmony with one another. The movie is anchored by arguably one of the most moving, dynamic, and emotional biographical performances thus far - Denzel Washington's Malcolm X. Washington gives such a diverse and vivid portrayal of the man. From his troubling days as a misunderstood youth, to his successful moments as a rising voice within the Nation of Islam, to his final days as an enlightened, reformed human being, Washington depicts every moment to a sharp and polished degree. Every technical aspect of the movie is executed to a near perfect degree. Whether it's the camerawork, the lighting, the sets, or the score, Spike Lee successfully manages to use every one of the aforementioned factors to add to the film's thick mood. \"Malcolm X\" is a drama that is long, yes, but it is necessary for everyone to see. For the rise and fall of this young man is not only complex and tragic, but it's unbelievably inspiring.",

With Nelson Mandela and Ossie Davis providing the epilogue and eulogy, Malcolm X goes farther than it should in creating the character.  But does that necessarily destroy the movie?  No.  The lack of depth between Malcolm and wife Betty is a disadvantage, as is probing and explaining the wae between Malcolm and the Nation of Islam.  However, it is Denzel Washington, portraying the titular figure from youth to middle age, who shines.  Charismatic and stern at the same time, he is the epicenter of the film.  A lesser actor would have made this a glorified History Channel film.  Astute viewers of other Spike Lee films will notice some of the director's trademarks, especially in a scene near the finale (which also seems rushed, but no bother).",

He's a man who has a strong belief and set of principles which grow and progress as he does.

Malcolm X has a great natural, documentary feel and makes great use of inter-cutting historical footage, with fictional news footage and the narrative of the film.\n\nThis film brings to light one of the great travesties of Hollywood: the fact that Spike Lee couldn't get them to finance this film is ridiculous. When presented with a script, cast and a director of this calibre you give them the money, and when a filmmaker has this much passion for his project you give him the support as well.

Will think about it for a few weeks now... Since I saw the movie, I was so fascinated that I immediately saw all the real life speeches and interviews by the late Mr. X! Spike Lee directed so well, and depicts history so realistically, that it puts you right into the spot, period and the life of Mr. X. The scene in Mecca, for example, is the real deal, there are no fake locations, all those people praying, and Denzel Washington with them :) (there's a beautiful scene where Malcolm prays completely in Arabic language, which shows how dedicated both the director, crew and Denzel were). Malcolm's best speeches are shown as they really happened, Lee really did his research :) The assassination scene broke my heart, made me cry, and made me feel rage for the loss of such a genius..I don't know what else to say, one of the best biopics ever...Go see it!",

Who have called it \"shoddy filmmaking\". Who have called it \"lacking in impartiality at best, and dangerous to people's perception of race relations at worst\". \r\n\r\nI'm sure the real Malcolm X might have deemed such reviews compliments. \r\n\r\nThis is a story about a man who was raised in a more racist society than we as a modern society can even imagine: The lynchings (or attempted lynchings), the violence, the rapes, the dehumanizing words, piss-poor education, job discrimination, inability to vote, negative stereotyping in media, etc., etc., etc. This is a story about a man whose house was burned down by the Klan, and whose father was murdered by the Klan (I know it's implied, but under the circumstances, I don't doubt that's what actually happened for one second). This is a story about a man whose mother had several children to take care of with very little life insurance to help her because the agency deemed her husband's death a suicide in spite of the evidence to the contrary, and had every last child taken from her and placed in even worse conditions in a foster care system that did not care one bit for them while she herself was locked up in a mental institute for 26 years. This is a story about a man whose grades were stellar but who was forced to work onboard a train as a servant, as a criminal on the side, and was told he should find work as a carpenter rather than a lawyer because that was \"no realistic career goal for a n****r.\" This is a story about a man who walked on eggshells daily while in a relationship with a white woman for fear of her calling it rape and resulting in him being sent to jail or worse. This is a story about a man who didn't even consider himself a man, let alone be considered one by society. \r\n\r\nIn my response to the detractors' reasons for detracting this film, OF COURSE it's going to be biased! It's Malcolm X's story. \r\n\r\nIt's his point of view, and that point of view was always changing. He went from a bright-eyed pupil to a hedonistic and possibly nihilistic criminal. He went from an apathetic prisoner to a spiritually awakened convert and one firebrand of a spokesman. He went from blind follower of Elijah Muhammed to a more secularly open political activist. \r\n\r\nIt may be biased, but at least it's honest about its bias, as Malcolm X was. He called the white man a devil more times than I can count, yes, but I doubt he embellished or made up atrocities committed by white people. He didn't cast himself as a saint either, even towards the end of his life. \r\n\r\nFrom the get-go, this was a powerful in-your-face film, made so by an electrifying delivery of \"The Trial\" by Denzel Washington during the opening credits, where he charges the white race for its many crimes, intercut with clips from George Holliday's footage of Rodney King being beaten by police. It's harsh, uncompromising, and bold. \r\n\r\nEvery actor and actress brought their A-game, even Spike Lee and Peter Boyle in their small cameos and especially Angela Bassett as Betty X, a strong portrayal of a black woman in both a racist society and as a member of a fairly sexist organization. The story moved along quite smoothly in detailing this man's evolution and triumph not only over an oppressive society but his own oppressed and oppressive state of mind. Emancipating himself from mental slavery, as Bob Marley would put it.",

But when all was said and done, he produced an epic blockbuster and a definite treatment of the man's life. There's great differences between the two as well, but to me Lee has many things in common with Oliver Stone. Both of them seem to have been born to make films. Both of them are uncompromising in bringing their artistic (and moral) vision to the screen, and neither will try to seduce the public by catering to their tastes. Both present their own interpretation of facts without apology. (For example, from what I've read it's not certain that Malcolm's father was actually killed by Klansmen. But Lee isn't in the same league as Stone when it comes to playing fast and loose with the \"truth.\") Stone even ends his movie 'Nixon' in a similar way to 'Malcolm X,' with footage of real-life figures blended in, though I'm not accusing Stone of imitation. This movie has an epic sweep and scope and as a director Lee is up to the challenge. He is served well by being able to direct in several styles, one of which is almost cartoonish: witness the scene where Malcolm (Denzel Washington) and Shorty (played by Lee himself) go stepping out at the Roseland Ballroom, resplendent in their zoot suits. Some comic relief is welcome at times because otherwise the serious, heavy message of the picture might be overwhelming. For instance, the movie opens with a full-screen shot of an American flag while we hear a voice-over of one of Malcolm's most rousing, or inflammatory speeches, depending on how you look at it (\"I accuse the white man of being the greatest murderer on the planet!\") The flag begins to burn and eventually forms a flaming 'X' as the fiery rhetoric continues. But if you haven't been scared away, the next scene shows the young man Malcolm Little in a funny situation, having his hair straightened by a concoction that threatens to burn off his scalp. Denzel Washington has won beaucoups of rightly-deserved accolades for his amazing performance in the title role. If you've ever heard or seen Malcolm X's speaking, you will be astounded at the similarities in tone and cadence. The illusion is so real one may not recognize that real archival footage of Malcolm is used late in the film. But this is not a case of style over substance here. Between Washington's talent and Lee's directing and screenwriting, an unforgettable character emerges. The film boasts other fine performances by Al Freeman, Jr. (especially good as Elijah Muhammad, a controversial figure in society, and eventually to Malcolm himself), Delroy Lindo, Albert Hall, Kate Vernon, Ernest Thomas and many others in its large cast. It's clear that Lee doesn't care for the Motion Picture Academy and they don't particularly care for him. But the snubbing he and his picture got at Oscar time would be comparable to Richard Attenborough and 'Ghandi' not being nominated the year that film was made. Ordinarily, one would think this film is the kind of production Hollywood loves to honor. But Academy Award nominations or not, the film 'Malcolm X' is like the man himself: impossible to ignore.",

This is an important movie that talks about one of the most disgraceful times in American history. I think the only person who could have directed this movie was Spike Lee and he did a marvelous job. \r\n\r\nI got nervous in the first 40 minutes because the story started out sloppy and unclear as Lee was going back and forth between Malcolm's life as a child and a young man but finally the story steadies out and the viewer feels as if they are in Malcolm's mind. Although the movie is 3 hours and 20 minutes, it goes by really quickly and is very entertaining. Denzel Washington takes command of his powerful leading role and he becomes Malcolm X. Its a difficult role because Malcolm took on 3 different personalities during his life, each one becoming more mature and Washington nails it. Some other Oscar worthy performances were by two of Malcolm's key role models: Albert Hall as Baines and Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Muhammad. \r\n\r\nOne minor weakness was the relationship between Malcolm and his wife since they seemingly go on one date where they barely know one another and then a few scenes later he proposes to her. Their early relationship went by quickly and I think they should have developed it more, but it was just a minor problem. The best thing Spike Lee did in the movie was show who the real Malcolm X was. People believe he supported violence and segregation but those misconceptions are proven incorrect in the movie. \r\n\r\nThis is a truly inspirational movie that can be appreciated by people of all races. Malcolm X is an important movie that I strongly recommend.",

            "content": "Biographical epic on the life of black rights and nationalist leader Malcolm X, as directed by Spike Lee, is equally stirring and conventional. At more than three hours, Lee chronicles forty years in the life of Malcolm X, from his life as a young hustler in Harlem, eventually landing him in prison, to his spiritual transformation into a leading spokesperson for the Nation of Islam. The early scenes have a lively jazz tone as Lee shows us Malcolm's aimless youth then shifts into a somber, serious tone in detailing Malcolm's emergence as an activist. Denzel Washington gives a commanding, beautifully expressive performance as Malcolm X. He captures the charisma and forcefulness of Malcolm's oratory skills but is just as effective in the quieter scenes. Al Freeman Jr. is uncanny in his physical and vocal impression of Elijah Muhammad. Gorgeously lit by the gifted cinematographer Ernest Dickerson. Some flaws: Lee glosses over Malcolm's pilgrimage to Mecca and spiritual awakening which was such a transformative experience in his life. Malcolm's fractious relationship with the Nation of Islam has been minimized. The importance of wife Betty Shabbaz (well played by Angela Bassett) is diminished. The white characters are at times cartoonish villains. The prologue and epilogue expose Lee's expected indulgences. Based on the phenomenal, non-linear \"Autobiography of Malcolm X\" as told by Alex Haley. This straightforward adaptation is by Spike Lee and Arnold Pearl. With Albert Hall, Delroy Lindo, Spike Lee, Theresa Randle, Kate Vernon. Selected for preservation by the National Film Registry.",

            "content": "Malcolm X is a lot of things: controversial, bold, procedural, and informative. From the audacious opening shot that reimagines and redefines the classic Patton image of the American flag, to the belabored attempt in the end to tie everything together with school childen, this film is defiant and unafraid to stand for its message. It's a spiritually enriching testament to the human capacity for change -- and surely Spike Lee's most universally appealing film. An engrossing mosaic of history, myth and sheer conjecture, this ambitious epic manages to sustain itself for 3 hours 21 minutes, and also overcomes an early frivolity of tone and Lee's intrusiveness to achieve a stature befitting its subject.\n\nLee, whose enormous affection for his hero suffuses his work, nevertheless resists the temptation to sanitize Malcolm as Richard Attenborough did Gandhi. The civil rights leader, as eloquently portrayed by Denzel Washington, emerges as an immensely likable human being -- a onetime black separatist who overcame his own prejudices. Still, this biopic will ruffle a few white feathers -- and probably a few black ones too; that's a given -- but Malcolm X addresses itself to all Americans, reminding us none too gently with its opening footage of the Rodney King beating that the work is never done.\n\nThough the film covers 40 of the most turbulent years American society, it seems oddly isolated from its time and place, almost as if the characters were trapped in a snow globe. This segregation may be purposeful, even astute, on Lee's part, but it denies Malcolm his historical underpinnings. And there's a theatricality to the crowd and street scenes that give the film the look of a Broadway play.\n\nLee brings all manner of styles and moods to the film's four chapters -- Malcolm's troubled youth, his conversion to Islam, his ministry and his pilgrimage to Mecca. It's Washington's formidable task to pull all of them all together, to reconcile the disparate Malcolms, which he does with uncanny ease. To make sense of the internal struggle, it's essential to know the tragedies of Malcolm's childhood, as recounted here in the Lee screenplay based on Alex Haley's \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X.\"\n\nThe result is utterly engrossing. Denzel, in what may be the finest performance of his career (this is the film to show people who doubt his versatility), imbues Malcolm X with fire, bravado, intellect, insecurity, pride, and love (both misplaced and direct) in equal measure. Lee once said that, in film school, making a film adaptation of Malcom X's life was a dream project. The pure, unfettered passion goes into every frame, and the result is one of the most fascinating and nuanced biopics ever made. A complex film about a complex man.",

There were many scenes I felt could have been cut, but still get the point across about what he was like before he turned to Islam.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the movie is what I enjoyed best. I knew very little about him, and so it was interesting to learn who he was. I admire him for coming out after his trip to Mecca to take back some of the things he had said in the past. I don't recall any other person in history ever doing the same. It is really too bad that such a soul was taken from us so soon. I truly believe this country would be a different place had he had the chance to continue on his mission. I also especially enjoyed the documentary that came in the Special Features. It goes a little more in depth on what Malcolm actually went through with the Nation of Islam after he left. What a sad story. It broke my heart to see a trying man have such evil enemies.

As a young man he was a hustler/pimp/drug pusher/addict before getting imprisoned for his crimes. While there he learns the ways of Elijah Muhammad and coverts to Islam. \r\nHe gets out of prison and becomes a spiritual leader becoming one of the most eloquent and powerful speakers that the world has ever known, and tackling white oppression head on. The tragedy that ultimately happens to him was heartbreaking because at that point he had reached a pinnacle of understanding and leadership qualities that could have changed the Black Muslim movement in a very positive way.\r\nDenzel Washington delivers an awesome performance and makes a charismatic leading man and it is difficult to imagine that anyone else could have done a better job with this role. It is an incredible performance, worthy of the Oscar. But no, he won that for playing a corrupt police officer in \"Training Day,\" the logic simply escapes me. If it wasn't for his engaging and powerful performance then this film would be very bland for the majority. Spike Lee directed this movie as a tribute to a hero who transcended racism though enlightenment and moral superiority. It's beautifully made with top notch performances by the cast.

            "content": "Spike Lee might be one of the most underappreciated auteurs in the film industry, primarily because his absurd politics obscure the talent that is bursting from most of his films.  As a result of his racially obsessive politics several of his films dealing with race have been viewed as too radical to give a fair chance, and at the top of this classification would be the 1993 biopic on controversial civil rights leader Malcolm X.  However, Lee does something incredible with X's life:  he doesn't promote racism through depictions of X's life, but instead shows that even the most ardent supporters of such corrupt thinking can change.\n\nMalcolm X is a racist man in this film.  Granted he has several admirable traits:  he elevated himself from the slums of crime and society, he is a passionate man with a moral code and true convictions, he is self-educated on a level few human beings are, and most of the time he is charming.  And yet any time those qualities start to flourish we are presented with X's outcries and racist tirades that only serve to distance white and black races further.  Many might suggest that Lee is presenting this as a positive thing, but X is continually shown to be wrong in this mentality.  When he finally sees the error of his ways shortly before his death and changes his ethos to one accepting of all races, the true message of the movie is presented:  being a decent, good person is incredibly difficult, and often when trying to find the path of decency we get lost and must find out way back.  \n\nWashington is astounding in this film.  Why he didn't win the Best Actor Oscar is beyond me, for out of a career of powerful, penetrating roles this is his most impressive work to date as an actor.  He doesn't try to make Malcolm X too deified or too villified, but presents him in full, with his merits and his MANY mistakes and flaws intact and ever-present.  This film packs such a tough punch and at first it seems X can't be made into a character we care for because of his divisive politics but in Washington's hands he makes it effortless.  Lee's direction is the other star of the film;  beautifully fluid editing, incredible tracking shots, and in general fantastic shot construction makes this film a feast from a technical level.  Lee has always had a technical virtuosity to his style (having been mentored by Martin Scorsese surely didn't hurt), and it is most obvious here.\n\nMalcolm X belongs among the best biopics to come out of Hollywood, especially because it pulls no punches in portraying its controversial source in a \"warts and all fashion\".",

Now, I read the autobiography, and it was a great one too, the only problems I have with the movie are that Spike skips out on Malcolm's period Doing and selling drugs, living in a whore house, and burglarizing houses.(Although yes there is one scene where he does cocaine, and another where he breaks into one home, but then gets caught)Which I can see because of the films PG-13 rating. And secondly, Spike changed the way Malcolm began practicing the Muslim faith(or maybe I misread the book). But all that aside, it's a great film adaption to Malcolm's life with terrific performances by the entire cast which make it a must see film!",

            "content": "This is without a doubt one of the best films ever made. Denzel Washington gives without a doubt one of his best performances of all time as Malcolm X, the civil rights leader who was pro-violence against the white people during the civil rights movement before coming to his senses and realizing the Muslim religion he was so eager to lay his life down for was hypocritical and in some ways I felt used Malcolm X, or just got too jealous once his stature in the Muslim religious group was getting him so much attention that people believed he was the voice of Allah; not the honorable Elijah Muhammad. They turned on Malcolm X, just after he literally devoted his life for their cause because their religion helped him get sober, and allow him to find himself again before becoming just another degenerate in Harlem. Denzel literally is Malcolm X. Just like Daniel Day-Lewis was Lincoln, and like Sean Penn was Harvey Milk in Gus Van Zant's \"Milk.\" No one, and I mean no one could have had the strength and endurance to play Malcolm X as Denzel Washingoton did in this movie just makes me believe that Denzel is without a doubt one of the best actors that has ever lived. He's a fearless actor, the man has a true potential for acting. I mean come on the guy did not win his two Oscars for \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" for nothing. But there is something about \"Malcolm X\" that just hits you hard when you watch it, mostlt because Denzel is just so damn good throughout  the whole movie that he is truly the driving force behind this\nwhole movie. There are also great supporting performances by Delroy Lindo, the hoodlum gangster of Harlem, who takes Denzel's Malcolm X under his wing after he sees him smash a guys with a glass bottle after insulting him and making a comment about his mother which Denzel tells him ferociously to never say another word about his mother again. Albert Hall, who played the chief in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam achievement \"Apocalypse Now,\" is great as Bane, the man who shines the light onto Denzel's Malcolm X and converts him into the realm of Islam and helps him become a Muslim. And then there's Angela Bassette and even though they toned her looks down a little bit for the movie so she can look like a typical Muslim wife of Malcolm X, she still looks good and even today at 56 she still rocking it if you ask me. She gives a very, very strong performance as Malcolm X's wife and even though I have only seen a handful of her films, I find she delivers every time I see her in a movie. Even Spike Lee, the Director of this movie who I know is very controversial subject matter these days even bring a great presence as Malcolm X's hoodlum buddy in the film. This is a movie not be missed as I would definitely put it in my \"1001 Movies You Need To See Before You Die\" list and just want to say one more thing. This is the most historical bio I have ever watched and truly believe this was my first Denzel Washington movie and I remember even seeing \"Malcolm X\" at a young age when I believe it had just started coming on TV after being in the movies and thinking the whole time watching Denzel Washington in this movie that this is an actor I have got to keep an eye on as he is truly, TRULY a remarkable actor who I hope keeps bringing us more great performances for years to come. Also about Spike Lee, even though like I said before he is a controversial subject matter these days I will admit one thing, no one but him could have directed this movie as for a man of Spike Lee stature I would like to say this is his \"Goodfellas\" as nobody but him could have made a movie like this I truly applaud him for this was a very fierce movie to make and even though he was nominated for Best Director for this movie even though I feel he should have; Denzel Washington was able to execute Spike Lee's vision....and that's all that matters.",

This movie show that old truth that whenever there are men with power, even if they are all on the same side, they will do anything to keep there power. There were a couple of strange directing choices, flashbacks that don't seem to fit and at one point there is a freeze frame of malcom talking first person (a la goodfellas) when we have been in third person the whole time. Still this film held my attention for all 3 pluss hours and thats not easy. \nSide note: totally unnecessary footage of the Rodney king beating at the beginning was way out of place.",

The background songs were great and well-chosen, the atmoshperic 'score' just felt out of place and overblown.
