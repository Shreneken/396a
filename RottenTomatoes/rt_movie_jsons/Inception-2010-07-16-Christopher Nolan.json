In the case of Inception, the premise is interesting, the cast is impressive (Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elliot Page, etc.), and the special effects are periodically spectacular.  However, as with a handful of his other movies, the story becomes convoluted beyond belief (it's a dream\u2026within a dream\u2026within a dream!!), resulting in the characters providing expository dialogue to explain the madness to the dumbfounded audience, giving the whole thing a condescending vibe.  There is a kernel of a great idea here, but Nolan insists on ruining it by showing off his towering intellect.  Thanks for nothing.",

The music is so loud and amped up that one cannot even fall asleep in the popcorn. To suggest that the innermost level of dream boils down to a scene from Ice Station Zebra or another Alistair Maclean speaks to an incredible lack of imagination and genuine original creativity.  And there is no wit, no humour, no sense of fun, it has all been bleached out. As your most famous creation asked, 'Why So Serious?' Yawwwwn.",

From the moment of the opening scenes, you are drawn into a world where reality and dream are blurred and separating the two is not straightforward.

There are some inconsistencies, but overall, very entertaining. The whole premise behind the film is excellent but there is a lot of ambiguity. I would like to have seen more sophisticated storytelling in each layer. The snow scene just appears to have been action for the sake of itself, even though the outcome was vital to the plot. However, the final outcome of the dream sequence is never explained outside of a dream, so we never get to understand if it all paid off.

But while it's really good this film isn't perfect their are some flaws but the flaws can be overlooked like for example their is a lot of exposition in the film but it's necessary since it their to explain the concept of the movie since it involves Dreams which is a weird concept that any normal person would be asking questions about like how do they work?, can this happen?, what happens if I do this?, etc. \n\nThe film is super entertaining their is not a time you will feel bored or feeling like your time is being wasted like the dreams they never get through what's the point of it existing but instead it always begins right in the middle of it. Like in the beginning of the movie we don't have scene of Cobb & Arthur arriving at the party, talk with the other guests, planning a meeting with Saito which finally establishes why we are here. It skips all that & instead has us learning that Saito is in a dream & that he has a secret that's worth stealing right away before we learn all the other info first since we don't start off in the beginning of the dream we start off in the middle of it which has us constantly wondering what happened before this? how did they get into this situation? whenever they enter a dream which gives it one of the most thrilling movie openings of all time & leave anyone watching with excitement on what's going to happen for the rest of the movie.\n\nIn the first dream our characters kidnap Fisher which has them having to deal with his security, in the second dream they are already trying to get Fisher to join the team all while the environment of the dream is being moved around with due to gravity of the car chase, In the third dream we are scouting out a military base which has Fishers secret the team has been looking for. Notice how their is no filler here it's all just what we want to see it's made to make sure we don't get bored. But this does sorta make Fisher seem like a boring character that is just a tool for the characters goals but that's where your wrong since they have Earmes infiltrate his legal team but they skip all the boring interview steps & instead put us right in the moment we want to see he we see the relationship Fisher & his father have right away these scenes are also connected with a clear reason & motivation for us being here so it doesn't feel random or out of nowhere. \n\nThe concept of Dreams in this film is also very interesting they aren't bound by any rules or realism through out the film characters are hopping between dreams all the time that differ from one another one minute we could be in a Train than a Plane, Asia, Europe, etc & the weather changes to it could be sunny, rain or snow their is no limitations on what can happen or where which makes the visuals not feel repetitive or all the same every dream is different than the last.",

            "content": "Writer/director Christopher Nolan is one of the most daring filmmakers out there today. He loves to craft intricate narratives ripe with symbolism and thematic layers that you can peel back upon repeated viewings. He is a dreamer with a lot on his mind, more than most other filmmakers. The guy who toyed with chronology and narrative structure in 'Memento', who redefined the possibilities of the comic-book/superhero movie with his cerebral 'Batman' films, has staked his place among the best directors of our time, an artist who creates vivid dreamscapes on silver screens for audiences to take in. With this trippy sci-fi mind-bender, the movie event of the summer and the best film of 2010 so far, he has created perhaps his most elaborate dream yet. This strikingly original, intelligently dense, and wholly absorbing film is an enigma wrapped in a puzzle trapped in a maze. From the first moments to the final \"twist\" (one that has sparked much debate and analysis) the film pulls you in and casts a dazzling spell. Nolan fills the frame with astonishing visuals--Paris folding in on itself, a city of skyscrapers that crumble into the sea. A gravity-defying fight sequence in a corridor is a serious jaw-dropper. Leonardo DiCaprio is a sturdy, compelling presence that guides us through this dizzying maze. Solid support is provided by the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard and Cillian Murphy. As far as popcorn actioners go, this is VERY smart and challenging. Blink, and you'll miss something. But this rewards close attention, and will undoubtedly unravel glorious symbolic riches upon multiple viewings. Like the very idea of \"inception\" at its core, this film will get inside your head, fester and churn, and stay with you LONG after the end titles disappear. A brilliant masterpiece",

I have seen it 10 times (literally) and have still not gotten sick of it. Christopher Nolan can be described as nothing other than brilliant- absolutely, purely, enchantingly brilliant. His cinematography is always top-notch, but his plots are to die for. There is always something so alluring about his films. INCEPTION is a beautifully complex action-thriller about the art of transporting your consciousness into someone else's mind. You go into their dreams- their secrets are yours to discover- but it all comes at a cost, of course. This movie has some action scenes, some curse words- pretty acute swearing, and will lead you to question a lot of things. Nolan always has an all-star cast that never disappoints, and loves to use Hans Zimmer to do his soundtracks. Hans Zimmer is the perfect composer for Nolan movies- their individual arts of music and cinema combine, leading to a perfect, jaw-dropping movie. This movie will make you feel amazing; invincible. I must warn you, though, this is one of those movies that you have to really think about (Nolan's beautiful brain strikes again). \"What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate.\" - Dom Cobb, Inception.",

Also a bit weird that Saito is just able to wipe any charges from Cobb\u2019s record or find him in Mombasa just before he gets caught by the people chasing him (though this may or may not be a dream sequence but even then, whose mind are they in at the moment?) I may have misremembered some of this as I haven\u2019t seen the movie in a few months but I\u2019ve seen it 3 or 4 times; like I said it\u2019s one of my favorites but it admittedly has some flaws that some may be put off by.

The plot is so unique and awesome with this unexpected twist turn you never could have seen it coming. It feels so realistic, like it could really happen, because Nolan has done such a good job on creating Inception. The action is quite lame for a PG-13 movie, if I'm to be honest, but the whole big plot is so interesting why bother needing some action. I would have been just fine if there wasn't any action.\nIt is such a breathtaking movie, and the breathtaking moments start from the very beginning. It is a bit confusing to follow, but they do go along and explain what is happening and what \"Inception\" is. The big twist when we learn that Cobb had already used Inception on his wife is shocking! I don't know about your opinions, but I believe Cobb is accountable for his wife's death -- even though he didn't physically kill her, he planted a dangerous idea to \"keep her safe\" which backfired to her committing suicide. The whole movie is breathtaking and superbly made. It is one of the most unique/original sci-fi films out there!",

Christopher Nolan, nos regala un mundo aunque muy complejo siempre interesante. Siempre con ese sello de calidad que este director posee. Donde aunque si te distraes le puedes perder la pista a la pel\u00edcula, la misma se encarga de dejarte el desarrollo claro en escenas explicativas. El como los personajes se desarrollan en la trama es muy interesante. Teniendo el conflicto interno de cada uno de ellos expuesto en la trama, ya que la pel\u00edcula se apoya de ellos para llegar al punto clim\u00e1tico de la cinta, la pel\u00edcula se basa completamente de las emociones de los personajes; ya sea como el personaje de Leonardo Di Caprio se embarca en esta pel\u00edcula por recuperar a sus hijos o como el personaje de Ken Watanabe se embarca en un prop\u00f3sito igualmente personal; La estructura de esta pel\u00edcula se hace fuerte en la profundizaci\u00f3n de personajes. Los efectos especiales de esta pel\u00edcula me volaron la cabeza; solo cabe ver en detr\u00e1s de c\u00e1mara de la escena del pasillo para notar que estamos ante una pel\u00edcula totalmente diferente. En esta pel\u00edcula todos los involucrados pasaron a ser los mejores de la industria, se puede notar la dedicaci\u00f3n que se le puso a esta pel\u00edcula, ya sea en cosas notorias como las antes mencionadas o en peque\u00f1as sutilezas en como esta estructurado cada escenario. Esta pel\u00edcula a pesar de tener sub tramas que no terminan de cerrar, te lleva por un mundo muy interesante. Un mundo que no te deja de sorprender en cada acto de la pel\u00edcula. Una historia con una estructura casi perfecta. Los recuerdos negativos tienden a opacar a los recuerdos positivos.",

All the while, Hobb must battle the secrets that lie beneath his own subconscious.\n\nHonestly, I was expecting much more from this film. But it took me around 10 tries to sit through its entirety. Not only is Inception's runtime bulky, we aren't introduced to all of our key characters until around the 50-minute mark and it takes 90 minutes for the epic plan to take motion.\n\nYou kind of have to watch it with company in order to stay hooked. Your viewing buddy will have to keep you focused, because it is far too easy to get drowned in what feels like a clunky, massive information dump (in the first act). The excess exposition bogs down the pace of the story, which is so difficult to follow with all of the dreams inside of dreams inside of dreams\u2026 \n\nThe talented cast gave sterling performances, with Gordon-Levitt being my personal favorite. The best thing about Inception's editing and cinematography is that a great deal of the visual effects were shot practically and were admittedly stunning. And while the third act is a bit drawn out, it is undeniably the best part of the film. The intercut action sequences feel a bit more cohesive. It was great to see the team in action rather than the team in talking.\n\nTo say the least, Inception is WAY overhyped, has an acquired taste, and did not exceed my expectations. In true Christopher Nolan fashion, this movie comes with an avalanche of too much exposition to stick to your brain that comes hurling at you at a snail's speed. But when it hits you, and destroys everything in sight, it's something to see\u2026 I guess. 68%.",

The action scenes especially in the middle of the film were my favorite parts, plus the ending scene. Not to mention the cast of actors that they were able to have participate in the production, very noteworthy.\n\nThe film does have some issues though that may alienate some viewers. Much of the phenomenon in the movie is left up to a lot of interpretation and can make your mind too blown while you're still trying to keep up with the plot. It can be a lot to take in all at once and confuse people who aren't used to a movie like this. Plus I think that the romance between Cobb and Mal bogged down the main mission of the team a little too much, but I still see why something like that was included.\n\nOverall a pretty good movie! There is a lot to say about this movie and many ways to analyze it and that's why it was popular I guess!",

He knows how to deliberately lose the audience's comprehension to then retrieve it with magnificence. What truly makes Nolan's famous fiction movie Inception a masterpiece of time and reality mayhem, is the way the story is written and developed. It starts with a pretty strenuous concept: the inception of dreams. But then, as the story unwraps, with well-pace actions, embracing dialogues and great characters dissections, we begin to fathom what this concept of infiltrating dreams can serve for, alongside how it actually works \u2013 using great insight of true physics and thorough studies upon the very subject of dreams and time. All leading to an ending that wraps into this \"open ways\" notion. \nThe casting is straight up perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio embraced the role of Dom Cobb as a professional, really diving into the trauma of the protagonist and exploiting the pain and adventurous errands that this character went through in his past. Tom Hardy nailed the role of the Eames, a character capable of impersonating others within one's dream, using his seriousness and his passionate sheer acting. Cillian Murphy, managed to play the role of a broken son left with the legacy of his dead father like a boss, using his prowess acting and his bewitching voice. And last, but not least, Eliott Page, who really knows how to do her job and create an emotional and interesting character, Ariadne, ready to help her team as the ingenious architect of dreams. \nI could spend a day writing about the story and how the cast, the full cast, is perfectly chosen, but I think the points I've given are enough to catch your attention \u2013 without spoiling the whole narrative \u2013 if you haven't seen the movie yet.",

            "content": "I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.\n\nNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film \"Paprika\" in the whole \"invading dreams\" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.\n\nVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (\"G.I. Joe\", \"Transformers\") or the exact opposite (\"Doubt\", \"Invictus\"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.\n\nAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where \"Inception\" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.\n\nOnce the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (\"Avatar\" be damned).\n\nOf course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort \"Shutter Island\". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.\n\nNolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (\"The Dark Knight\"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.\n\nChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And \"Inception\" can proudly stand alongside \"Blade Runner\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.\n\nThere are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.\n\nMissing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.",

If Memento introduced the world to Christopher Nolan, and The Dark Knight elevated his career to becoming one of the biggest directors, then Inception catapulted Nolan into a league of his own. Inception has become everyones favourite \"confusing\" film (to be honest, the movie is pretty straightforward if you pay your full attention towards it). The film, which was being promoted as an action thriller, was so much more than that. There was the iconic action sequences of course, but there also was an amazing emotional quotient to the film. The film is also pretty interesting to think about, because technically Leonardo DiCaprio's Don Cobb could be considered the bad guy as he alters the thought process of Cillian Murphy's businessman character in order to allow Ken Watanabe to succeed in his ventures. Also, the movie doesn't have a direct antagonist if you think about it. Watanabe and Marion Cotillard are presented as possible villains, but they're not necessarily evil incarnate. Both have specific motives which are not specifically evil. Cotillard's character in particular is very layered, and we see that even though we as the viewer might see her as a villain, she has Cobb as a reason why she acts and thinks the way she does. But what Nolan made possible with Inception was one thing in particular, \"smart blockbuster.\" He helped prove to studios that creating a huge movie with incredible depth could be financially and critically successful. Not only have directors and studios over the years referenced or tried to make the next Inception type film, but we've also seen these big films try to make spectacle work in throwback ways. Like the majority of his films, most of the big stuff was done on set and in camera, allowing the viewer to really sense how real the production values are. But the biggest success of this movie is probably the fact it is still being talked about to this day. Some movies are forgotten within months, but Inception has been a talking point for cinema goers for years now. And the answer to the final scene: Cobb is in reality. Not only is not wearing his ring, but the top never wobbles in the dream.",

And so I decided to check this movie out. And now I have literally no idea what he was smoking. This movie is a masterpiece even by Hollywood standards. It will continue to be known as an iconic movie for generations to come.\n\nThe story is based on Cobb, a thief who uses people's dreams to to learn about their secrets and then uses them to steal from them. Because of the movie's title I thought that the entire movie is taking place in a dream and when they are actually shown to go in a dream it is supposed to be an inception. It was only after I read about it on Wikipedia that I understood that the main movie is taking place outside of dreams.\n\nChristopher Nolan did the absolute right thing by using practical effects instead of CGI. And it was also a pretty genius move to show your dreams that can actually happen in reality. Although many of the dreams shown in the movie look more like James bond films instead of actual dreams, I wouldn't just on that perspective since this is a subjective idea. Most probably many people have such kinds of dreams and they were the ones who were kept in mind when writing the story. But overall this was a great idea since the whole idea is that Cobb steals from the dreams of people and they would not realise that it is a dream only if it is made to be shown as realistic as possible.\n\nThe characters have also been explored very well. Cobb's wife used to be his partner in crime, but after a while she got so much addicted to the inception machine that she started thinking that the real life is also a dream and thus she committed suicide thinking that she will be able to meet cob in his real life. Cobb has been holding himself responsible for his wife's death and does wants a chance to correct his mistake. He has recruited a college student learning architecture and that provides a good way to give exposition without making it look either forced or confusing.\n\nThe only problem I had with this movie was the amount of talking that happens. In every scene there is talking, talking and even more talking, whether it is the the real world scenes or the dreamscapes. It was really boring to see them talk in a movie that is supposed to be about going into other people's dreams and stealing their knowledge and memories. The amount of exposition also seemed unnecessary and it felt like it was only meant to explain the people who are very slow to understand. But other than that I didn't have any problem.\n\nOverall I would say that Inception is one of those movies which define the decade as well as the the potential of Christopher Nolan's storytelling. This movie is a perfect blend of looking legendary and having mostly used practical effects. I considered to be the best Christopher Nolan movie after The Dark Knight.",

Talks about Dominic Cobb is a professional who takes care of extracting secrets from people's minds while they sleep, infiltrating their dreams through a special device that allows a group to participate in a \"shared dream\".  Cobb and his team normally use tricks and deceptions to steal information from the victim, who he believes to be in reality and suspects nothing.  Together with his partner Arthur tries to enter the mind of Mr. Saito, a powerful Japanese businessman, to perform an extraction, but fails when the dream projection of Mal, dead wife of Cobb, appears in the dream interfering with the  operation.\nI advise you to look at it very carefully, otherwise, you will not understand the ending well.\nI think it is one of the best films of 2013, because it differs from the others, it is not monotonous in the plot and you can see that the director has perfected every detail in order to make it fascinating and moving. I wait for you to see it and leave a personal comment.",

Why do we dream 'faster'? etc.. but those things are kind of marginal to the plot as it rips along.

Then, as the characters showed more about the movie's universe, I was so amazed with the cinematography, like the scene where the dream world was flip into half up and down. \n\nThe story itself was complicated and required me to stay focused. Since I got some memories of when I first watched the movie, I did not struggle too much to fully grasp what was going on. This was for sure not as complicated as Tenet. \n\nWith the story, Nolan dived into the human subconscious and applied the Freudian psychology. \n\nOverall, a total blast for the whole 2.5 hours.

The issue I had was that he went out of his way to introduce elements to make the team's path to success more difficult but did so in an unfortunate way, having his main character thoughtlessly insist on imperiling the mission when plenty of alternatives existed for relaying to Eames the shortcut and explaining away the added danger of sedation by basically making it a magical sedative that only leaves you in mortal danger within the dream but will still let you wake up if kicked. Surely with some proofreading or outside notes these could've been handled more carefully and we would've been left with an absolute timeless masterpiece.

            "content": "Inception is a movie from 2010 about a father, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, trying to get home to his kids. To do that he needs to do one last very risky job where he will enter someone's unconscious mind while they're asleep and try to plant an idea in their mind. The problem he has with that is that by entering there he also goes down into his own unconsciousness and it'll bring his dead wife into his mission accidentally, who will become a problem for everyone involved. It finishes with him finally getting home but right before the end there's a huge hint pointing out that he may still be asleep and being home is just another level to his unconscious desires which would mean he never really got home nor is he living his real life anymore.\n\nI wholeheartedly love this movie. The ideas of exploring one's unconscious and the way of distorting time the director plays with throughout the movie are just amazing to me. There's a lot of explanation as to how dreams work and the roles your mind plays in each level of your dreams, and the director put so much in blurring the lines between reality and dreams so artistically that it inevitably feels like watching a moving masterpiece. There is a scene in which DiCaprio is talking to someone in a bar and the building he is in starts to shake because the characters are in a car chase in the previous level of unconsciousness. It is obviously a science fiction movie, but it is explained in such a perfect way that it is as believable as it is nerve wrecking and intriguing. At the beginning you can see how different people work and get trained for the job, learning to manipulate one's mind. I think just the concept of the movie is so interesting, I'd watch it all the time, however there's more than just that. The music and sound effects are just as good and accompany the vibe of the movie incredibly. Every single detail was clearly thoroughly thought about and adds to the realism of the movie in the most astonishing way. \n\nIn my opinion, the only thing that is missing from this movie is character \"personality\", the characters are not really individually introduced and most of them don't have any kind of development through the movie but I think, if anything, that allows the viewers to concentrate more on what they do rather than who they are or why they act a certain way. The director probably put less attention on the characters to put the emphasis on the visuals of the movie, which only makes it even more captivating. Essentially, I don't think there's anything in this movie, present or missing, that wasn't done on purpose.\n\nIn conclusion, the movie Inception by Christopher Nolan can be simply described as a masterpiece and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I believe every part of it was deliberately and meticulously calculated. It is so well structured that it keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat the whole time while deeply going into detail about what is happening. The movie has no plot holes, in my opinion, and it just still leaves your head spinning for answers and processing everything you just watched with an amazing suspense type of ending.",

The story is incredibly intriguing and creative with so much worldbuilding and the movie explains the rules of this world very well in a way that doesn't talk to its audience. The audience needs to actually pay attention to what's going on and I love that. It actually makes you think and the story leads to an incredibly exciting last 75 minutes as you genuinely feel scared for the characters, not just because they almost lose but the first hour sets up how important the mission super well but at its core, it's a character-driven story about a man wanting to see his children again and getting over the loss of his wife and seeing Cobb open up to Ariadne about what has happened and her helping him get over it is quite emotional.

The main thing every viewer says when finishing this film is how beautiful the cinematography and effects are. Nolan uses a lot of practical effects in his films and this one is tough to accomplish, but he does it with ease. The acting across the board from the entire cast is great. His selection of actors all come from different backgrounds and filmography so it\u2019s great to see all these people in the same project. This movie uses special effects to bend time and space and it\u2019s visually incredible. This movie is the hit that it is because of its appreciation to be different and bring a new story to the eyes and ears. The score is mesmerizing and adds tension and a faster pace during slower sequences. Any fan of time bending movies or heavy action special effects chaos, this is the movie for you. Not much bad to say about this film, just open your mind and let it unfold for you. ",

            "content": "THE ONE THING that disappoints the most about this film is that, even though the film transpires mostly in people's dreams, there is very little that is dreamlike about them. Instead, the dream landscapes are there to accommodate a handful of action movie setpieces. They are visually stunning setpieces to be sure. In particular, the gravity defying fight scene in a hotel corridor, in which people's bodies are pulled toward constantly shifting centers of gravity, to match a parallel tumble off a bridge in which the bodies of the sleeping dreamers within the dream are plummeting through space in a van. It is a remarkable achievement. However, it is not the stuff of dreams. Dreams are eery and psychologically unsettling. They express buried fears and longings while hinting at the existence of awe-inspiring supernatural forces. And quite often, the locations are spare and minimal. Great filmmakers like Federico Fellini and David Lynch filmed dream sequences that left viewers with gooseflesh, and they did so by fiddling with combinations of settings and sounds usually in spare surroundings. They did so by tugging at the viewer's empathic sense of kinship with the character, and sparking a commingled sense of attraction and dread to the dream narrative. Films can only achieve this effect of heightened emotion and involvement when there is something at stake, something that the viewer cares about. Regrettably, I didn't care about anybody or any outcome in Inception. Will one multinational corporation surpass the other in wealth? Who cares? Will the morally shady Dominic be reunited with his kids? I don't care that much because he's an emotionally closed character. Will Christopher Nolan tie up all the loose ends in his high tech mental thriller? I suppose he did but, again, I didn't care.\n     Inception reminds me of another film in which the main character yearns to return home, The Wizard of Oz. But unlike that film, it is all brains and no heart. Nolan needs to find the courage to admit he is wanting as a complete filmmaker and change his game to reflect the maxim that I learned when I entered teacher's college: \"No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care.\"",

I originally watched 'Inception' when it first came out, which was 10 years ago, and holy sh*t was it better than I remember. This is a masterclass of filmmaking. This is what going to the movies is all about. Action, drama, mystery - this movie had it all - sci-fi, thrills, romance. A unique story, a visual spectacle, and surprisingly more emotional than I remember it being. The cast was perfect, the story was captivating, and none of this would have been made possible without writer/director/producer, Christopher Nolan.

Maybe it can be slightly overwhelming or confusing, but all it really needs is some extra brain power, then you should be fine.

I'm so happy that he got quite a few awards for the best cinematography in 2010, he honestly deserves them he did such a great job.\n\nThe action sequences which end up happening throughout this movie, either it being in the real world or the dream world are all very well done and they're also very cleverly done, which I thought was really good.\n\nThe score which was composed by Hans Zimmer is honestly really well done and I think he did such a great job on composing the full soundtrack for this movie.\n\nOverall, Inception is a brilliant movie and it's honestly a masterpiece and a half.

The layers of this movie make it what it is. Some could say this is all about family and what family can do to the mind. Others can say that this is just a big analogy of movie production. What tops all is how this movie can pick apart a mind in such a casual manner. A beautiful used this idea as the main idea for the movie, whereas Nolan uses this idea and combines it with action, romance, and grief. Nolan is at his best with his direction. The movie is shot beautifully and he's never been better in the action department because in his Dark Knight Trilogy the action is shot very poorly. In this, he uses firearms instead of hand to hand and he doesn't use a ton of cuts. Also, the scene where the ground shifts is so well shot. His camera tricks in that scene are so smart and unique. Not only that the movie is written to perfection, but it's also very well thawed out and clearly looks like it went through at least a hundred drafts. The performances are also spectacular. Dicaprio is amazing and Tom Hardy adds some very well placed charisma. Lastly, Ellen Page was more than up for the job as the opposite lead to Dicaprio and she is the perfect way to gently put in the much-needed exposition. Without Page's character, the movie would be a mess. I give Inception a 100%.",

This isn't the first time I've watched Inception, but every time I do, I bring a top out and spin it just to be sure I'm not dreaming. Upon, I think my fourth watch, it's safe to say that I understand so much more of this movie than I did my first watch. Having a movie that requires multiple watches is always good, honestly, I'm not sure how I missed certain moments of this. But, making a mystery this good is already a huge bonus here. I'm going to sound like a broken record player when I say this, but Christopher Nolan is changing Blockbusters almost as much as Steven Spielberg back in the days of Jaws. Rather than focusing on a previously established franchise (excluding the Dark Knight Trilogy), he finds an original idea and makes an amazing film out of it. These films don't only have the fast paced moments to keep casual viewers entertained, but also some quieter moments making the story and characters feel rich, making the world feel that it is lived in. With Inception, Nolan takes the concept of going inside dreams and makes it into a heist movie. That wouldn't work if it weren't for some of the amazing settings of this movie, some of which were filmed on location. While I would never have a dream as down to earth as any of the dreams in Inception, I'm glad Christopher Nolan made the choice to use settings that are quite normal, this way there is always that small voice in the back of your head questioning whether the characters are dreaming or not. There is plenty of symbolism in this movie to richen the mystery as well. The character of Cobb's father is seemingly a large clue pointing to what's real. Even some of the action feels well paced. Note that I say some. As, unfortunately, most of the action in this movie ends up in the final act, which is common, but the way that any threat to the characters is immediately diffused doesn't really work for me. While the reveals at the end put everything into place in one's head, all the emotional moments at the end are crammed in next to action scenes, many of which I couldn't tell what was happening. Inception is a brilliant film. In typical Nolan style, he makes a big budget blockbuster that has A-list stars, but doesn't get too caught up in what the studio wants so it can make money, he made the Dark Knight trilogy, he's going to make money. Christopher Nolan knows how to make his movies meaningful to everyone, and seeing this just makes me more excited for Tenet.",

Inception was absolutely riveting. It is a movie which makes you think and feel, almost as if you're in the movie yourself. Never will you ever see a movie with such a unique and complex story line. The plot itself is like a ball of yarn, once unraveled to be tangled again, and slowly unraveling itself as the movie progresses.

Tremendous performances from all of them.\n\nDiCaprio is always a great watch, he kills it in this production - the perfect person to play Cobb. Gordon-Levitt and Page are excellent here, despite being the two I'd (wrongly) assume would be the weaker performers. Hardy and Murphy are the opposite, I expected top level and they certainly gave it.\n\nEverything about this is astoundingly good. Christopher Nolan & Co. get it so, so right. The film is such a smooth ride in terms of following the premise, in spite of the roller coaster ride you experience seeing it play out. The ending is fantastic too, many films on this scale mess up the conclusion but they don't.\n\nIf all that isn't enough, they even got Hans Zimmer to score the damn thing. Icing on the cake.",

            "content": "A mind blowing intellectual caper!\n\nChristopher Nolan directs his sci-fi thriller Inception (2010) with a keen eye, creative mind, vast potential, and astute precision. Inception is sleek thanks to Christopher Nolan's inventive direction and original script. Inception is famous for its shocking twists, breathtaking cinematography, and high concept narrative. Nolan's ambitious direction ends you stunning you with strange and enticing visuals, enthralling action sequences, and groundbreaking visual effects. The CGI holds up as cities fold unto themselves and worlds collapse, while I also appreciate Nolan's dedication to practical effects like the revolving hotel hallway fight that's already as iconic as it is impressive. Inception is mind boggling due to Nolan's creative directorial vision and unique focused auteur style. No other director could have crafted Inception.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is heartbreaking and enthralling as the lead Dom Cobb. His mind robber is so cool and in control until his past tears at his heart. DiCaprio is devastating during a particular hotel room scene on a balcony. Marion Cotillard delivers her greatest acting in Inception as Mal Cobb. Her chemistry is apparent with DiCaprio. She sweeps you off your feet with surprise appearances, sultry looks, and seductive words, but Cotillard uses her warm eyes and sincere voice to command your attention. Together, DiCaprio and Cotillard elevate an already magnificent film into an instant classic.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt is too cool as the operator of the mind breaching equipment. Inception remains some of his best acting that I like more every time I watch him here. Ellen Page is astounding as Ariadne the architect of the dream worlds. Her mind is sharp as are her comebacks as DiCaprio's foil, but it is Page's empathy for the suffering of others in Inception that makes her character so sympathetic and likable. Ellen Page has never acted better than within the tender affection she portrays in Inception.\n\nTom Hardy is hilarious as Zak Eames. He's just effortless in Inception. Ken Watanabe is so smooth and captivating in Inception as Mr. Saito. I do not want to spoil a single moment of his revelation of a performance. Cillian Murphy is fun to watch him get duped in Inception as Robert Fischer, but his final farewell to his father, played by a phenomenal Pete Postlethwaite, is just soul crushing to see.\n\nMichael Caine is astute and poignant as Stephen Miles in a great scene as DiCaprio's foil. Dileep Rao is funny as Yusuf. Tom Berenger is excellent and particular as Peter Browning. Lukas Haas has an interesting cameo as Nash the architect. Keep an eye out for the flight attendant as that's Christopher Nolan's cousin Miranda Nolan! Lastly, Talulah Riley is gorgeous and alluring in her cameo as The Blonde.\n\nChristopher Nolan's original script demonstrates his writing prowess at creating an imaginative science fiction story centered around a mental heist to insert an idea into someone's head. His intricate plot of diving deeper into layers of dreams within dreams once confused me, but upon revisiting Inception, I actually understood the entire plot because Nolan goes out of his way to include you by indoctrinating you into this chaotic world through his informative dialogue and perceptive nuance. His ideas are ambitious and unique with intelligent thoughtfulness, but always accessible to the audience through his pristine style and common language. Inception is incredibly well written down to every clever line. I have to mention Nolan's heartfelt themes and inclusion of emotional connections to engage the viewer despite their certain confusion. Inserting a father and son's bond with a husband and wife's estrangement is genius levels of depth on top of all the dream diving. The start washing into the end's shoreline is just too smart.\n\nLee Smith's editing is mind numbing to think about how he spliced together the exact order of each dream level sequence. Nolan and him must have talked for hours about Inception's sequencing and editing style. Wally Pfister's cinematography is sleek and striking with some of cinema's most iconic shots: the city folding on top of itself, the mirrors reframing the shot, stairs appearing out of nowhere, to the gorgeous shorelines of consciousness in Limbo. So many lovely wide shots envelop Inception's cold methodical world in a sense of wonder. The production design makes everything look sterile and crisp, so that anything can appear suddenly and look natural.\n\nHans Zimmer's legendary score for Inception is infamous for his blaring bursts of sound and beloved for his epic scope of sonic noise. Zimmer composed some of his best material for a gripping score to accompany Inception's captivating action. The costumes and make-up look like a Tom Ford or Gucci commercial, they are that clean cut and slimming. You can count all the cool suits. Marion Cotillard's dresses are simply sublime on her.\n\nIn all, Inception is an all time great film of astounding originality and creative filmmaking. Christopher Nolan clearly wanted to outdo himself and he ended up directing one of his best features with Inception.",

There are only a few issues, such as a little too fast pacing, even though the film itself is about 2:17:00 long, and also I would have preferred them not show the helper on the train until After it was revealed to be a 2nd dream state. Also some bland emotional displays overall. Other than these small issues it is as perfect as a movie can be made. Totally Amazing film when you are in the mood for an action movie.

            "content": "\"Inception\" is Christopher Nolan's science fiction drama, released in 2010 and that grossed more than $800 million worldwide (film is definitely successful, because the budget is $160 million).\nChristopher Nolan is creaing this art perfomance as a director, screenwriter and one of the producers.\nOperator - Wally Pfister\nComposer - Hans Zimmer\nArtists: Guy Diaz, Luke Freeborn, Brad Ricoeur\n   The main character Cobb is a unique thief: he steals valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable. Cobb's abilities and capabilities made him a valuable player in the world of espionage, but they also turned him into an eternal fugitive and deprived him of his family.\nAnd now Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. He, along with his team, will have to implement the idea, and not steal it.\n   I'll start with the cons.\nFirstly, the visualization is messy. The characters of the picture are engaged in espionage, penetrating the dreams of their victims. Does that actually look as a dream? Not. Rather, there are continuous labyrinths of surrealism and empty absurdity. For example, cool concept of the Cobb's subconscious multi-level world could be made more spectacular.\nSecondly, in fact, \"Inception\" is mainly an action movie of the 21st century, that attempts to also include drama and look thought-provoking.\nThirdly, not a single character is perfomed enough, and the script line with the wife of the protagonist looks dull. As a viewer, I was completely uninterested in Cobb's experiences and his relationship with his wife.\nFurther, druing the film, the feeling that \"now, it will definitely begin!\" doesn't leave you. But nothing begins. There is no goddamn madness.\nIn this chaotic hurricane, not a damn thing is clear. And he makes the pathos public exaggerate the meaning of the \"Inception\" and include it in all kinds of movie tops for all time, and to justify saying that this movie is not for everyone.\nPassing through pros, the main plus in the film is music. Hans Zimmer's music fits the \"drama\" of the film.\nThe second plus is imagination - the integration of ideas through sleep and so on will excite any viewer, because it is original and unusual. Nolan even developed a whole concept - the creation of sleep, a sense of time. But it turned out far-fetched.",

Therefore one of my big requirements for a good movie is great worldbuilding, something Inception did both literally and figuratively by not outright revealing too many details but still giving us enough to go on the establish a clear idea of the world we are witnessing.

            "content": "Christopher Nolan has become a victim of overhype in my eyes as it is a shame that a perfectly fine director of semi-intellectual popcorn movies was raised to the status of a modern day Stanley Kubrick in the view of internet fan boys. In part because of all this raving that I can't help but feel slightly disappointed when I watch The Dark Knight (2008) and find another silly superhero film dressed up as a pseudo-intellectual story about guilt and fear. This film too suffers from presenting itself as high minded and intellectual when it's best moments come from the technical mastery of Nolan. He has always struggled to develop compelling characters and make the audience care about the relationships between them and this is largely what causes this film to be a passable but fairly forgettable psychological action thriller.\n\nDom Cobb, Leonardo DiCaprio, is traumatized by the suicide of his wife Mal, Marion Cotillard, who complicates his professional life as when he is attempting to insert thoughts into people's subconscious she interrupts his thoughts and he becomes distracted. He is hired by Japanese businessman Mr. Saito, Ken Watanabe, to convince the son of his business rival Robert Fischer, Cillian Murphy, to dismantle his business. He puts together a team to carry out this mission and the inquisitive young Ariadne, Ellen Page, probes him for information on his past and the reason that his ex-wife keeps appearing while he is attempting to plant ideas in the minds of others. When the group he has assembled become trapped in the subconscious of Fischer they realize that they must use their ingenuity and smarts to achieve their goal while also making it out alive. Meanwhile Cobb comes to terms with the decision that his wife made, partly caused by his placing ideas in her mind, and chooses to return to happiness in any form.\n\nIn today's environment of superhero films almost every movie has dazzling visuals with incredible special effects and mind-bending visuals so it is hard to cite visuals as the reason to see a film. Yes, it is exciting to see cityscapes brought towards us at an alarming rate and then to witness Page, with her tiny frame, mount this vertical street but there is the feeling that it is lacking. With all of the obvious visual homages to Kubrick it also lets itself down as the baroque style room that Fischer farewells his dying father in resembles the room seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) but we can't help wanting the deep themes of that film instead of a disinteresting plot about a volatile couple. I needed more from this film and I didn't receive it which was frustrating because I began watching the film with such high hopes and that there were points where the film came close to them made it all the more maddening.\n\nNolan's inability to present emotionally developed or engaging characters and relationships hampers him seriously as a writer and filmmaker and that this film dedicates a significant portion of it's running time to a relationship that fails to engage hurts it. We know very little about Mal and she comes across as icy but emotionally volatile, as many women are, but she seems more like a plot device than a real character and her sudden emotional outburst are unexplained with an actress as fine as Cotillard failing to carry them off. Even seeing the children that Cobb and Mal abandons fails to elicit sympathy as we feel nothing for either of the parents and know virtually nothing about these children that would make us care for them. The end of the film wants to be profound as we understand that our protagonist wants his family so much that he is willing to accept living in an illusion in order to be with them but because we do not know Cobb and his emotional turmoil and Mal very obviously exists to propel the plot forward I was not emotionally moved at all.\n\nOther irritations were brought on by the writing of the film as the other female character in the film, Ariadne, exists to ask the male characters around her questions about the process of \u2018inception' and then have them explain to her and the audience the various plot mechanics. I wish that more had been done to flesh out these characters and perhaps with a bit more work the film would have been the intelligent popcorn film that it was hailed as.",

            "content": "All the over-the-top images; more like a painting, are justified by reasoning, science and a little bit of imagination.\n\nInception\n\nNolan is a filmmaker to be afraid of. What P.T. Anderson did for straight three hours in Magnolia, you are going to have that same exhausting experience in this visual galore. Inception deals with a metaphor heist commanded by an expert extractor named Cobb whose only dream is to go home. Away from the action and the skills he masters at, and in order to reach home, he goes through the final test by embracing and learning the first thought entering his mind.\n\nI remember I was ahead of Nolan- or so I thought. I claimed to know his method of decoding a subject and then he coded this cinematic marvel in front of me. So here's how he goes through a script. He treats them like a sketch show. Simple as that. And just like in a sketch show there are plenty of sketches- duh!- surfing around it. Now, a sketch is actually a double edged sword. In the sense that it needs a start, a middle act and a final act, in every three minutes. And once you get over it- which is usually engaging for its compactness- you have to come up with an entire new idea. But this is why it favours majorly on Nolan's side. Since, he has to deal with the same world, he creates, celebrates and destroys the world in each act that also contributes to the bigger picture completing the circle and leaving us satisfied. Another thing to note here is, how he celebrates. In an \"action\" espionage thriller, you would expect some punches and bullets and explosives. But the way he celebrates- or in layman terms exaggerate or gloats- is by envisioning his germ of the idea on different set pieces and locations. Ergo, his action is never your typical luxurious action. Just watch Joseph Gorden Lewitt surviving on that hotel without or under influenced gravity.\n\nScience over emotions. Yes, I think as much as brilliant the subconscious play and the contingent unknown backup plans work on the film, I found myself cheated on the emotional background that our protagonist Cobb, played remorsefully by Leonardo DiCaprio, goes through. Don't get me wrong, the back story is incredibly rich, it's just the way it is treated. It is like after every- thrice to be precise- major event, Ellen Page and DiCaprio are told to reveal little by little information about the past in order to manipulate us. But this is just a minor flaw in this Nolan's masterpiece that not only subjugates but even belittles writers like us.",

His slow motion and fighting scenes are my favorite thing in the movie. I think Cobb should have had this cool exterior as well and all the emotion should have been focused inside Robert's dreaming.

As a movie, it plays out similar to a heist film but with no actual heist and a much more complex plot.. Thanks to the dreaming concept, there are some points of special effects that are actually done really well and look/fit perfectly. This also applies to the well-timed speed changes, going from regular speed to slow-motion without feeling at all out of place. It is paced well and hits every beat that it tries to hit. Even if you don't particularly like the idea or genre of the film itself, I feel that it is a movie that everyone should see at some point as a representation of well-made film that takes advantage of modern effects without using them overwhelmingly.",

            "content": "The best things about Cristopher Nolan's \"Inception\" are the idea and the music. The idea is that people are able to share dreams, and to have dreams within dreams, if they have the right equipment and know what they're doing. They can even plant ideas in other people's minds through a difficult and delicate process called \"inception\" (as opposed to the more usual and much easier \"extraction,\" which involves stealing thoughts from others). What makes the movie so interesting is that the \"mark,\" or the person the inception team is targeting, doesn't know he's dreaming. Yeah, that's pretty cool. \n\nThe movie never explains how inception works--the tech guy just flips open a silver briefcase and hooks people up with wires. And the whole idea of multiple dreams-within-dreams doesn't seem too plausible. But I was willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of the movie. (If you could believe that machines used humans for batteries in \"The Matrix,\" you shouldn't have any trouble believing the premise here.)\n\nThe music, also by Nolan, is pulsating and effectively used, constantly driving the tension and providing much of the movie's energy. \n\nIn the end, however, Inception is just a series of inter-spliced action scenes, some of which are preposterous. Only the music, and the fact that we keep being awed that these are all dreams within dreams, make any of it the least bit interesting.\n\nThe real problem with the film is that it's not about anything important. Well, Leonardo's character and the story about his wife are important on a personal level, but the plot surrounding the movie's act of inception by DiCaprio's team holds no interest for us. Who cares if some rich guy breaks up his father's business empire? Who cares what cartel controls the oil market? It's just not important, and the movie doesn't even try to convince us that it is. Instead, the majority of screen time is devoted to implausible car chases and fights all the way down through the dream levels. The penultimate dream level, which takes place on a snowy mountain, has one guy defeating an army of enemy agents, with the whole thing looking a lot more like a battle against inept Storm Troopers from \"The Empire Strikes Back\" than Nolan probably intended.\n\nWhy couldn't Nolan have made a movie about saving the world, or at least some small part of it? Then I might have cared about the outcome. But no, our hero just wants to get home by helping a foreign oil baron.\n\nAnd the bit at the end that has everyone watching the movie 20 times looking for clues? That strikes me as nothing more than a simple editing trick to leave us with some ambiguity. It makes the movie seem a lot cleverer than it really is.\n\nThere was a lot to like about Inception, and it's fun to watch. The directing, acting, music, production, cinematography, and pace are all excellent, and the idea of controlling others' dreams is mind-bending. DeCaprio's storyline, which is really what the movie wants to be about, is good too. Unfortunately, it's all wrapped in nonsense that isn't worth trying to unravel.",

Yet the story would have us believe that she would fail to recognize the one state that is not so malleable - the state of woke reality.  This flaw broke the central premise of the movie for me.  It also didn't help that the story offered no reason to be invested in the scheme of the industrialist bankrolling the project.",

Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) doesn't steal things, he steals ideas. By projecting himself deep into the subconscious of his targets, he can glean information that even the best computer hackers can't get to. In the world of corporate espionage, Cobb is the ultimate weapon. But even weapons have their weakness, and when Cobb loses everything, he's forced to embark on one final mission in a desperate quest for redemption. This time, Cobb won't be harvesting an idea, but sowing one. Should he and his team of specialists succeed, they will have discovered a new frontier in the art of psychic espionage. They've planned everything to perfection, and they have all the tools to get the job done. Their mission is complicated, however, by the sudden appearance of a malevolent foe that seems to know exactly what they're up to, and precisely how to stop them.\n\nEverything with this movie is amazing, I mean every-single-thing, from the very beginning to the very end, you never get bored, you never get tired of this amazing 2h 28min masterpiece, you know why? Because this movie has a story that it never ends during the movie, to be more clear, every moment a new thing reveals so you won't get bored of it!\n\nThe performances also are talented, everyone was more than amazing, I was amazed of how they were acting! Also the CGI, it was pretty amazing, it was sinless, actually everything about this movie is sinless.. anyways... The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, what can I say? Stunning, I.. loved.. it!! And now, the direction, every shot was well-directed, the direction really really was amazing, Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all the time.. actually, this movie contain lots of my favorite stuff: favorite director (Christopher Nolan), favorite composer (Hans Zimmer) and my favorite actor (Tom Hardy).\n\nThe plot didn't explain too much to keep you excited and hype, also it didn't set up the characters cause they will be explained later on, and I meant to say \"explained\" because these characters are super-complex. After the plot the movie took a great twist with the first act by being  little pit clear, you think? The second act came to make it complicated again, but don't worry, the third act is here to help you by setting everything in the right place.\n\nInception is an A+ movie!\n\nAlright, guys, lots of Christopher Nolan movies coming up thanks -as always- for reading my review, hope you like, and if you do, you can check all of my reviews right here.",

Every character had a role to play and a well developed and executed lead from DiCaprio. Very clever practical and special effects - they got a rotating corridor!. The only criticism to have is that some concepts are not the most original i.e. dream world vs. real world.",

            "content": "Inception is a Sci-Fi, Action-adventure film written, co-produced and directed by Christopher Nolan, his 7th feature film of which he has been director. The narrative follows a thief called Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who uses dream-sharing technology to steal corporate secrets. However, when approached with the task of planting an idea in a CEO's, he must recruit a team to try and complete this. This film has a star-studded lineup (although it wasn't considered this at the time of release), including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe and many others.\n\nDespite being renowned for having a very difficult narrative to follow, which I also found upon my first viewing, I believe that after seeing it a couple of times and suspending your disbelief, that it is an extremely clever story which Nolan is telling. Even more so knowing that it is an original screenplay.\n\nAt the time of release, as mentioned previously, the lineup were not as well-known as they are today, especially the like of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy. Although, looking back at this film with the knowledge of how all of these actors and actresses developed, it is clear to see why. Every single person who stars in this film is exceptional, not a false note anywhere. There isn't a moment where I felt like I was watching a someone act, it all felt very genuine and real, which is key in making the audience suspend their disbelief, directly helping them to understand the plot further. Tom Hardy (who I am a very huge fan of for his work in Bronson, Locke, Legend etc.) really smashes this performance out of the park as the lovable Eames.\n\nSome of the set pieces that we see in this film, the rotating hallway scene immediately comes to mind, are outstanding and even hold up to, if not surpass, those that we see in releases today. The numerous moments that made my jaw physically drop when I first saw them is what takes this film from great, to epic.\n\nHans Zimmer incredible score that really adds weight to the emotion that you feel sitting in the audience, cannot possibly go unmentioned. Zimmer has frequently worked with Nolan on a number of films, including The Dark Knight Trilogy, Interstellar, Dunkirk and Man Of Steel. Yet again, the two styles blend perfectly, creating a very hard hitting and tense atmosphere throughout the film, which I found especially prominent in the final scene, amplifying the \"dramatic-ness\" I felt.\n\nAll in all however, this is my favourite film. Christopher Nolan never fails to impress.",

If you have only seen it once and you somehow didn't like it, then go see it again as you may see it in a totally different way. For essentially an action blockbuster, the plot is so complex and yet holds together better than films with more basic premises. Chris Nolan's personal and totally original masterpiece makes you think and gasp all the way through. In a world where invading and sharing dreams is possible, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Joesph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hardy dive deeper and deeper into Cillian Murphy' military trained subconscious in order to implant an idea. The set pieces are spell bounding and outstanding. For a film that hits the two and a half hour mark, it absolutely speeds over like freight train. Special shout out to Hans Zimmer's score which expertly integrates the fabulous Edith Paif's 'Non, je ne regrette rien'- slowing it down to create the iconic Inception BAAAAHHHMMMS, which every movie trailer now seems to \nhave borrowed.

It has been said that Hollywood relies too much on special effects to cover lazy storytelling; not so with Inception, where truly stunning visuals only supplement what you'll really be talking about: the story, what it means, how it moved you, and how shockingly original it is. I've never seen anything like it, either in concept or in narrative structure. Neither have I attended, in a long time, a film that gave my brain such a workout.\n\nThis is a movie that expects you to pay attention and make connections. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a heartbreaking performance, leading a cast of top-notch actors playing interesting characters in a film that appears to be a science-fiction action/heist caper (a rather unique concept in itself), but is actually about guilt, the desire for redemption, and the raw power of simple ideas. Director Christopher Nolan, as he did with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, takes something fantastic and paints it in realistic tones. This is what unbridled imagination, combined with intelligence, emotion, and talent looks like on film. It is mentally and emotionally challenging. It also has some terrific action (including a physics-bending fight sequence that is jaw-dropping) and is very creative in its use of cinematography, editing, and music. Though comparatively light on language, with no sexual material and action violence where physical harm is not what's at stake (you'll understand when you see it), Inception is nonetheless not recommended for anyone younger than teens due to its complexity and intense subject matter.",

            "content": "Intelligent, unique and exceedingly thrilling, Inception is that rare Summer blockbuster that strikes a defy balance between being both a visually striking masterpiece as well as an intellectually made film. The performances are excellent all around and the film is full of interesting characters. Leonardo DiCaprio leads the film with a profoundly layered and complex performance as Cobb. While at first the character seems confident and bold from the outset, it becomes pretty clear there's more than meets the eye and his tragic backstory is conveyed perfectly through his performance. The rest of the cast do just as well, although the development between them ranges from some to not as much, if only due to the amount of people onscreen. With an interesting concept concerning a machine that allows for others to implant and or steal information and ideas from the minds of others, it fully delivers and allows that to take center stage, and rightfully so. It's a unique premise and as the film becomes more and more complex as it wears on, it's an achievement in itself that it doesn't lose itself along the way. There's also a surprising amount of heart as well, as the film has a dramatic subplot that actually fits well into the plot. There are occasional moments where the exposition segments can get a bit heavy however as the film frequently has to slow down to ensure everyone is caught up but thankfully they're few and far between and after the first act they all but vanish. To top it all off, the ending is satisfying, if also ambiguous, but so are all the best. Christopher Nolan's direction is just fantastic, as he intricately weaves the outre sci fi elements of the dreamscape with the dramatic angle that the central romance requires without overdoing on either. Probably his biggest achievement though is how well he's able to juggle all of the film's moving layers, especially when the film moves into its third act and everything becomes very complex, reflecting the confidence of an increasingly reassured director. For all of it's visceral elements, the stakes feel more than justified in Inception. The editing seamlessly moves between the many different dream sequences with ease, and the intensity of the sound editing only elevates it all while capturing the sense of lucid dreaming. Arguably above all else though, the film is a visual masterpiece. Its almost gratifying to see a film reach so high in its visual ambitions without skimping by on its narrative. Although it may have its flaws, Inception is nevertheless an ambitious thriller that truly shows a director at the top of his game and the full extent of what a blockbuster can really be.",

I finished still a little bit in the dark. Is he still dreaming or was that end scene real? Turns out Christopher Nolan wanted to leave the end ambiguous so no-one will ever know.

            "content": "Inception benefits from it's commitment to telling it's absurd story with a straight face.  It is full of ridiculous exposition, logical inconsistencies, and a surprisingly mundane audio/visual pallet considering it's visionary ideas.  However, for all it's extremely self serious dialogue and surprisingly dry stylistic choices, there are moments where the story manages to connect both intellectually and emotionally in a way that very few big budget action films ever do.  The film is very plot driven, which is understandable given the time constraints of a roughly 2 hour movie that dives into some very complex ideas.  This comes at the cost of character development, which means that every character outside of Leonardo's Cobb is essentially a completely 1 dimensional plot device.  This is greatly assisted by having an all-star cast of naturally charismatic actors adding subtle hints of character and personality where none exists in the script, and it is one of the reasons this film would never work as a small budget affair.  This film embraces it's overblown, self serious traits and combined with it's incredible (and probably very expensive) special effects, it manages to make the absolutely ridiculous quite believable a lot of the time.  There are likely going to be nagging questions in your mind that arise from the inconsistencies of trying to impose pseudo-scientific rational onto dream logic, but the film moves at such a breakneck pace with such a great feeling of momentum and tension that it is easy to ignore these problems.  Leonardo Dicaprio gives an incredible performance that helps to elevates this script from the B-movie goofiness it could easily become into something that feels relatable and emotionally haunting.  Overall, while this isn't quite my favourite Chris Nolan film, it is one of his most entertaining and audacious.  It is also one of the most ambitious and bold huge budget hollywood films in recent memory and is truly an experience to sit through, especially in theaters.",

            "content": "Inception is written and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious, and is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for a seemingly impossible task: \"inception\", the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious, Practically invading personal dream, and it can create new dreams after dream and after dream. The ensemble cast additionally includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\n\nFirst time of seeing Inception has to be one of the most creative movies I have ever seen of this decade!! I'm very serious, seeing the score on rotten tomatoes is quite flawless from professional review were's. So to say it is not a science-fiction action film, it's practically a drama telling of the sense of drama of the science of the mind of the human brain. This is one of the reasons why I love Christopher Nolan because of the structure of studying human beings. Out of any outcome of the exposition of the story or the exposition of a story or anything. \n\nThe exposition of the story is not even that noticeable really, once you first start the movie, you're in a practically new world, The world has never been brought up. But once he gets through the story are the first act you put the puzzle pieces together, and then do explain the pieces of the puzzle. This movie is a great example of how exposition should work and should be the blueprint of what to use and what not to use for exposition scenes. \n\nAs I just said that this was not an action science fiction film but it is, it's surprisingly a drama, very well use with Christopher Nolan prove it from his predecessor the Dark Knight. In the middle of the story Leonardo Caprio's character had a wife, they spent all their life in the dream world, once they left the dreamworld they came back to reality, and it causes him pain for his wife and she killed herself and blamed it on the husband. It was quite interesting seeing that scean, because the film is still not putting the puzzle together. \n\nOnce when they get to their target, the wife intervenes with the dreams, so she can have her husband back in the dreamworld. Until the end of the movie it has to be one of the best ambiguous endings of cinema history. I will not spoil it, but it is required to see this magnificent film. \n\nWhat I like about Christopher Nolan's films you really have to think, it doesn't matter by if it's an action film from the Dark Knight movies, or anything that he does you really have to think throughout his films and I swear I really love about Christopher Nolan. I surprisingly I have no flaws once again with Christopher Nolan. This movie is phenomenally smart, vary smart!! The persons brain is the second character of the film. The brain is not featured in the film whatsoever, but the audience that is watching the film. \n\nYou can practically watch this film over and over again. But every time when I go see inception, I always find something new. Back into thousand 10 when I first saw the film I was in a trance.. I saw this film at least six times of that year in the movie theater, and the Blu-ray of the film is quite abuse from my Blu-ray player watching it over and over again. I just love to watch this film because there's always something new with this film. Sometimes it is a bad telling of the story and sometimes it's a great telling of the story. \n\nI want to find very interesting that is very relates to an anime called \"Paprika\" a 2006 film directed Satoshi Kon, I film  genius himself Rest In Peace!! Paprika what is an is the blueprint for inception, I highly recommend seeing the film to I give it a a perfect 10 for that film as well. \n\nBut with the right sources and the right timing and the right blueprint and inspiration of a couple of animes that Christopher Nolan loved and endeared. Really does show that anime can inspire directors and a great story can inspire viewing audience of like. With the dark Knight and the rest of his nine films like inception will go down in history that this film will be never be forgotten. \n\nGrade: A Perfect 10",

The action sequences are as well choreographed as the ones present within The Dark Knight Trilogy and Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an effective performance. In fact, the main villain in the film is...himself. Well, his subconscious anyway since his wife Marion Cotilliard won't leave him alone continously messing up their plan to plant an idea in Cillian Murphy's head. I kinda accepted its complexity since before the actual story begins, the dreams are revealed as surprises. What do we call Inception, then?

Yes oddly enough, when compared to his other amazing filmography, it really is rather striking how much fun Inception actually has with itself as Nolan brings an unusual level of self-aware indulgence in his ambitious ideas and story to create more of a summer blockbuster feel. It's certainly not a vibe that one would expect then, but it is equally a very pleasant surprise that comes from the script - which leaves plenty of room for humour and grin-ensuing action - and the cast (in particular DiCaprio) who bring incredible life and whit to each scenario.\nOf course though, we are still talking about Christopher Nolan, so don't think for a moment that any of the edge and intelligence is gone either because it quite simply hasn't. In fact, on a technical level Inception ranks right up there with the director's best, as it packs bags of conceptual ideas, breathtaking visuals, and crucially this time - a brilliantly interwoven lead character to hook and engage you in the whole experience.\n\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Because of the way it deals each hand, it's not as profound and powerful as you might think, and some of the time it spends enjoying itself is time it could be delving even deeper into its themes and supporting characters.\n\nVERDICT: Engaging, clever and downright fun; 'Inception' proves that if Nolan lets his hair down, it doesn't mean he lets a strand fall out of place.

This film is also meant to stir up conversation which is rare for a film to do and common for a novel because this film purposely wants audience members to form their own opinions.

Every time I watch it, I love it even more. It gave an accurate representation of what happens in real life while we are sleeping. Inception brought dreams to the big screen, and it was visually impressive. The film is built up on so much brain power, that it becomes a suspense thriller after the first few times I saw it. Christopher Nolan made yet another masterpiece. When you are watching it, you can tell that he put hard work into making it, because there really no film like this one. Everyone's performance was well acted. The characters fit into the story very well. There is also a sub-plot that I was intrigued with. This is an exceedingly re-watchable movie that is sure to become a classic in the future.\nOver all, Inception blew my mind with deep storytelling, compelling characters, and 'dream-like' CG. 5/5 stars.",

            "content": "Incemption is a film made in 2010, directed by Christopher Nolan. The movie is a science-fiction thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the main character (Cobb), Joseph Gordon-Levitt as his best friend (Arthur), Ellen Page as Cobb's apprentice (Ariane) and Marion Cotillar as Cobb's ex-wife. The movie takes place in France, Australia, Canada and the United-States. The movie is in our modern day era.\nAt the beginning of the film, we learn that Cobb makes a living as being a dream thief. Cobb steals dream information of powerful businessmen. He enters into a subconscious reality of others where he does dream stealing called \"extraction\" (by taking information from others' thoughts through their subconscious dream state). In the confusion of the film's drama, Cobb is accused of killing his wife, this accusation loses him custody of his children.\nLater in the movie, Cobb starts working for Saito, (a former victim of one of Cobb's 'dream state' organized robberies). Saito is CEO of an International energy company. Saito wants Cobb to implant an idea in the future CEO of a rival company in order for the firm to go bankrupt. In exchange for this act, Saito vows to pay off Cobb's murder sentence, allowing him to take custody of his children.\nCobb starts doing dream implanting called \"inception\" (by making his subject fall into a dream state, in order to manipulate his decisions). After the thought implanted, his subject believes he has a brilliant idea for his firm but in reality, it makes his company fail. We will follow him through his journey. \nThe movie really takes the time explaining every aspect of dream \"extraction\" and \"inception\". The music composed by the well-known author Hans Zimmer keeps us focused during the whole movie. The music is used in key moments to intensify the emotions. The frame shots are incredible with impressive CGI effects. The movie passes an important message about letting go of the past. The movie is also very action packed and has a deep story to tell. It's a movie with a good cast, resulting in good actor performances. The only bad point is the length of the movie which could be considered too long by some. I really liked the movie, I think it was worth watching. It's a movie that will keep you thinking long after it's over.",

It has been said that Hollywood relies too much on special effects to cover lazy storytelling; not so with Inception, where truly stunning visuals only supplement what you'll really be talking about: the story, what it means, how it moved you, and how shockingly original it is. I've never seen anything like it, either in concept or in narrative structure. Neither have I attended, in a long time, a film that gave my brain such a workout.\n\nThis is a movie that expects you to pay attention and make connections. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a heartbreaking performance, leading a cast of top-notch actors playing interesting characters in a film that appears to be a science-fiction action/heist caper (a rather unique concept in itself), but is actually about guilt, the desire for redemption, and the raw power of simple ideas. Director Christopher Nolan, as he did with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, takes something fantastic and paints it in realistic tones. This is what unbridled imagination, combined with intelligence, emotion, and talent looks like on film. It is mentally and emotionally challenging. It also has some terrific action (including a physics-bending fight sequence that is jaw-dropping) and is very creative in its use of cinematography, editing, and music. Though comparatively light on language, with no sexual material and action violence where physical harm is not what's at stake (you'll understand when you see it), Inception is nonetheless not recommended for anyone younger than teens due to its complexity and intense subject matter.",

There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. \n\n2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. \n\n3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.\n\n4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. \n\n5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. \n\n6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.\n\nCons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. \n\n2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. \n\n3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. \n\nIn conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. \n\nI highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's mind bending crime thriller achieves something special, it is both a big budget action thriller and a thought provoking piece centred on dreams and the perception of reality. Few films are able to appeal equally to both the popcorn movie goer wanting to see great explosions and the serious film lover who wants a complex and artistic piece that will be expertly constructed. Nolan first honed this unique ability with Batman Begins and perfected it with The Dark Knight, and with Inception he has created another masterpiece.\n\nThe riveting story follows Dom Cobb (the ever brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio), an expert at stealing hidden information from inside people's subconscious by entering their dreams, as he accepts the near impossible job of planting an idea inside someone's mind. It sounds complicated and a bit mind-boggling but Nolan skilfully meets the needs of casual viewers and those wanting more. There is a tad too much exposition at times but the complexities of dream heists are presented well.  For those who embrace the story and its world, there is so much to take in and ponder, but the perfect pacing and expertly crafted action allows those who might get slightly lost at times to still have a fun experience. Although DiCaprio is the star, it is the perfectly chosen ensemble cast that make the film so convincing. Cillian Murphy and Marion Cotillard in particular are outstanding. It is not only the actors that are shared with The Dark Knight trilogy but also composer Hans Zimmer, who once again creates an atmospheric score that rounds out every scene beautifully.\n\nI mentioned expertly crafted action because the film features such unique and well-made set pieces. The world of dreams is full of great potential and Nolan harnesses this. The highlight is the fight scene that takes place as gravity shifts around the characters, which was made with practical effects. This practicality makes it completely unforgettable. Even with a focus on practical effects where possible, the film uses ground-breaking GCI to convey the reality defying dream worlds. \n\nOn the flip side to collapsing buildings and fist fights is the insight into the human mind that the film explores so intriguingly. Dreams are still relatively mysterious and the film attempts to unlock some of these mysteries. The themes it explores go far deeper than regular blockbusters and the ending shot is a mind blowing moment that has rightfully caused so much debate over its meaning.\n\nDespite its complexities, it is Inception's accessibility that lies at the heart of its brilliance. It asks you to think but equally wants you to sit back and enjoy what you are watching. Personally I thought it wasn't too action heavy or difficult to understand to put off either audience. It has something for everyone. It is expert filmmaking that can be enjoyed and discussed by all.",

Over time, I've found myself returning to this movie again and again and again, always interested in watching every moment. Nolan shines when he can sink his teeth into mechanics, and that made this the perfect project for him. Using the platform of people who can build worlds, he built his world! Nolan, as a world-builder gives the impression that he knows exactly how each mechanic works and its level of mastery. His success is realized when you and I, the viewers, think about what we saw and what the possibilities and ramifications are for the characters. Nolan masterfully navigated the idea of a dream and reminded us all what an original movie should look like. I rate this 5 stars as it truly never gets old, but gets better each time I watch it.",

            "content": "Inception is an excellent example of what a highly skilled director with a stellar ensemble when a studio trusts them enough to make what they envision. Watching it feels like being a part of Christopher Nolan's dream. The plot revolves around Leonardo Dicaprio's character, Dom Cobb, and his team. They have access to a machine which allows them to enter the dreams of others in order to extract information, however following an incident with his ex wife, Dom is forced to flee from his home. When he's offered the chance to return home, he quickly accepts but the conditions are that he must use his machine to plant an idea into the mind of a young man called Robert Fischer Jr., played by Cillian Murphy. Inception is supposedly impossible, but Cobb is certain it's possible. So Cobb assembles a team to complete his mission. \nThis team includes Joseph Gorden-Levitt's character, Arthur, who is by the book person. He is used largely for exposition but has his own moments in the spotlight later in the film including an excellent scene in a rotating corridor. The cinematography on this scene is brilliant and the fact that they used practical effects to make it make its all the more brilliant. One of the biggest flaws in the film is the amount of exposition it has to give however with such a complex plot you feel as though this is necessary. Ellen Page's character, Ariadne, is used to promote Arthur's exposition. She is also used to keep Dom in check on an emotional level. As you learn through the film, Dom is quite emotionally unstable and Ariadne helps him control these emotions. Tom hardy's character, Eames acts as a foil to Arthur. He is enthusiastic and willing to take risks.  He is also a huge badass and provides some comic relief. \nInception is a fun movie to watch. Visually it is stunning and the acting and writing is great. However some of the exposition does drag however most of the exposition is contained within the first act. The tone of the movie is great and its really interesting to play with the ideas of dream. The plot is very complex and some may find it difficult to follow however if attention is paid while watching it, it's is highly enjoyable.",

If \"Paprika\" was an overview of many ideas dealing with the subconscious, \"Inception\" takes a few of these ideas and analyzes them more thoroughly than a laboratory scientist on the verge of a scientific breakthrough. Some viewers may find the dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream harder to follow than Monty Python deductive reasoning, but the film delivers as strongly as any of Christopher Nolan's best efforts. This is the director's most Hitchcock film yet; the tense music and choppy editing go together in a way only Nolan can pull it off. The layered dream concept was interesting, with each layer getting deeper and deeper into the subconscious. However, I longed for wackier, impossible visuals. The one scene where the cityscape is literally bent upside down was awesome, as was the sequence with exploding flowers and cobblestone bricks near the cafe. However, such moments were far and few between. I longed for the parade of nonsensical electronic appliances in \"Paprika,\" stuff found only in the deepest reservoirs of our minds (or down-the-rabbit-hole.) \nThe film had a speedy first act (which was my favorite.) I enjoyed the explanation of the projections, the process to \"kick\" patients awake, and how these artificial dreams are constructed the same way architects use blueprints and CG simulations. However, the actual plan, once executed, seemed to drag, and not just because it took about a half hour for the van to plunge into the water. Later in the film, however, there were too many repetitive visuals of floating men in hotel rooms. After two minutes of it I felt like saying: \"I get it. It is a neat visual effect. Shall we move on?\" \nThe cast was top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio, once again, proves himself to be one of the finest actors in Hollywood today, and we are also treated to great performances from \"Juno\"'s Ellen Page as well as the usual Nolan suspects:  Tom hardy, Michael Caine, and Cillian Murphy. \nIn the end, I was impressed. The film took an interesting concept and ran away with it. While it did not pose the stark originality of Satoshi Kon's \"Paprika,\" (or use as many of the mind-bending concepts,) \"Inception\" is a refreshing breeze of originality in an era where everything seems to be sequels, reboots, or superheroes. An original story that appeals to the cognitive intellectual curiosity is welcome. We need more movies like this.",

Don't get me wrong, I like the balls it had to go so far into such a complex idea, the execution is just disappointingly masking pretentious slop.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan is a brilliant filmmaker who captivates us with the unique universes he creates within his films. He brought us into his dark, incredible version of Batman in the Dark Knight Trilogy. He takes us into space and time in his most recent film, Interstellar. In between the Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises, Nolan took us into our own minds with Inception. He created a spectacular world and story around our dreams, the emotional consequences of our decisions, the fabric of reality, and the power of an idea. The movie definitely makes you think outside the box. After the first time I watched Inception, I found myself questioning and unsure about what is real and not real in the world. That feeling is a testament to how novel and blown away I was and still am by this film. Nolan also assembles a great cast highlighted by Leonardo DiCaprio (Dom Cobb), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Arthur), Ellen Page (Ariadne), Tom Hardy (Eames), and Michael Caine (Professor Stephen Miles). As we know, Nolan loves using the same actors in different films. As a result, you will find a lot of the same actors in the Dark Knight Trilogy (e.g. Hardy as Bane, Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, etc.). Leonardo DiCaprio is tremendous as the protagonist. In my opinion, Ellen Page is one of the best actresses in show business and is definitely one of my favorite performers on screen. She delivers another stellar performance in Inception. The rest of the supporting characters are very strong and there is great chemistry among the cast. Inception is also a very good action movie. More importantly, I appreciate that the action fits in and makes sense with the concepts of the movie rather than being forced into them. One of the criticisms of this film is that it is too complex to follow. I disagree with this notion. While it makes you think and you need to pay attention, the ideas and the story is laid out in a logical manner. From my perspective, Inception is a near perfect movie. I expected nothing less from Christopher Nolan. When it comes to films, I know he only delivers quality. In Nolan we Trust.\n\nFor my full review, please go to http://rookerville.com/2015/09/21/retro-rehash-inception/",

Da una piccola idea si sprigiona una storia dalla narrazione senza eguali, che sfrutta ogni minimo dettaglio per arricchire una trama davvero innovativa. Perfetto tutto il comparto tecnico, compresa la straordinaria regia generale, la fotografia del fedele collega di Nolan e l'indimenticabile e inconfondibile colonna sonora del miglior compositore vivente.

Con tutti questi aspetti positivi Inception risulta un film potenzialmente rivoluzionario, che anche dopo 8 anni dalla sua uscita puo' gia' essere considerato come un nuovo Matrix.",

            "content": "Just finished watching this again on blu-ray!\n\nWelcome to 'Inception' - the exotic world of dream sabotage!\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio plays a thief who specializes in corporate espionage. Only thing is, he steals objects from people's dreams. He assembles teams who go inside people's minds and extract information while they sleep. Pretty cool, right? :)\n\nGod, I wish this movie were THAT easy to explain lol.\n\n It would be epic on that concept alone. But this is Christopher Nolan, and this movie is far more entertaining (and darker) than that.\n\nSee, DiCaprio and Co. aren't tasked to extract; they have the impossible task of INCEPTION (the opposite of EXTRACTION) - which is, to place an idea into a person's mind through their dreams - Without the person knowing! Oh the fun is just starting...\n\nThe further the 'dream team' goes into deep subconscious, the more dangerous things get. Eventually this movie becomes three separate action pieces - as each layer of dreaming takes on its unique set dangers. If that sounds confusing enough, imagine the characters trying to navigate each layer of dream while finishing their mission, maintaining sanity, and literally staying alive. EVERYTHING teeters on precision and exact timing. One false move and they slip into never-ending oblivion.\n\n\nChristopher Nolan is the champion of intelligent action thrillers and this is the possibly the undisputed king of mind-benders. Inception breaks conventional movie rules and creates new ones. Sure, there are other great movies like 'Momento', 'Requiem for a Dream', 'Fight Club' and the original 'Matrix'; movies which warp our perception of reality and deliver a great story...\n\n But Inception destroys all competition as a high concept thriller with nonstop tension and plenty of action. My review can't even do this movie justice. It's like trying to explain a crazy dream. And in the end, are we really sure about DiCaprios fate??? People are still debating the ending to this day!\n\nINCEPTION Christopher Nolan's magnum opus - and quite possible the granddaddy of all mind-bender movies.",

            "content": "A dream, within a dream, within another dream, and a descent into a final dream\u00e2?\u00a6 then limbo. Inception may be a film with literal layers, but for damn sure does it layer itself as an engrossing blockbuster. Inception will temporarily transform your outlook on life and the potential that lies beyond the basic understanding of dreaming. We have been looking upwards for new galaxies and planets, but little do we know there could be a whole new realm, or realms for that matter, fixed into the mind of humans. Directed by the masterful Christopher Nolan, Inception focuses on dreaming, reality, dreams within reality, reality within dreams and the perils of mixing the two together. It is incredible how someone could even conceive of a well-rounded idea and make a global phenomenon of a film by not baffling themselves in the first place. Inception deserves its universal kudos, but those who reject its greatness are either simple-minded or truly have reservations. One cannot deny that Inception is a vision, and that, that vision isn\u00e2??t flawless, but it is a damn good attempt at trying to achieve cinematic perfection.\n \nInception focuses on a professional thief, barred from entering the USA, who infiltrates the subconscious of his targets in order to execute corporate espionage. After failing his latest mission and being on the run, he is offered a chance of redemption and a return home only if he can execute the impossible task that is \u00e2??inception.\u00e2?? In reference to the film, Inception is an implantation of another person\u00e2??s idea into the subconscious of their target, making the idea theirs. As a title, Inception caught some people off-guard not knowing what was at its beginning or establishment point until mid-way through the film! Despite the plot revolving around planting an idea into their target\u00e2??s subconscious, it is all about the process of dreaming that is the film\u00e2??s main point of fascination and when the film addresses the drama about tainting dream with reality, you know that this is Nolan territory. Inception is a far-reaching blockbuster with a heart, but that heart is partially overshadowed by a mixture of tragedy and intricacy.\n \nThe complexity of Inception should be marvelled at with utter appraisal, as the simple matter of envisioning an idea so exceptional is a challenge in itself, let alone creating a fully-fledged feature film. Inception never once gets caught up in its complexity and it spends a substantial amount of time describing how this world can even come to fruition with scattered sequences of illuminating explanations. Inception not only explains itself efficiently, but this is done so well that it makes you think about the alternative world our subconscious could possibly withhold. You will find yourself just mesmerised about the many levels of dreaming states there are and the intricate rules that bound subconscious espionage. Nolan really challenges you to keep up with him; he sets out the structure of the film perfectly and then adds elucidating details to fill each level within the dreaming mechanism. Nevertheless, it is still a lot to take in on first viewing, and if you don\u00e2??t enjoy it, you really have to give it a chance and watch it for a second time, and maybe a third to completely get to grips with its premise. Most negatively, the complexity makes you constantly think about Inception\u00e2??s process, and the fact that you\u00e2??re always thinking about its mental steps, distances yourself from the proceedings therefore your own personal attachment to the film isn\u00e2??t that great.\n \nThrough the backstory of Di Caprio\u00e2??s character, there is a more intimate section to the film\u00e2??s large-scale entertainment. This intimacy appears more dark than what you would have expected as Di Caprio suffers uncontrollable guilt from the death of his wife that whenever he dreams, she appears and damages his plans. Each scene involving Di Caprio\u00e2??s guilt-ridden subconscious acts as a freshening sub-plot to the main proceedings, but this intimacy reveals its dark nucleus and puts a sombre mood over the film because it tragically bites Di Caprio on the ass on several occasions. This profound emotional side is almost secluded because only Di Caprio experiences it full pelt, and sometimes it is too emotional that you don\u00e2??t feel at all sentimental about it. The intricacy of its plot permeates pretty much everything that goes on, reality or (un)reality, and therefore the emotion looks profoundly affecting, but it unfortunately doesn\u00e2??t feel the same way. Despite its tragic gravity, this sub-plot is undoubtedly needed to make it Nolan-esque, because it adds a heart to the film, and in all of Nolan\u00e2??s blockbusters there is always a heart and that is what separates him from the rest of the many directors in Hollywood.\n \nIn terms of Inception\u00e2??s cast, it is predominantly male dominated featuring a group of actors that have been carefully selected to collectively electrify. Leonardo Di Caprio portrays the protagonist Dom Cobb, and with his consistent acting skills, he delivers a solid performance, but again lacks a sense of originality to his acting. Cobb is a meticulous soul, but Di Caprio fails to bring a diversification to his rich character. Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u00e2??s Arthur is involved in some of the best fight scenes in the film but he lacks a depth to his character, which makes him slightly boring. Ellen Page stars as Ariadne, the graduate student turned architect of their dreams. She functions almost as a psychiatrist for Di Caprio and a compass for the audience who like her are trying to comprehend dream sharing, making her a pivotal character who delivers a low-profile performance. Tom Hardy\u00e2??s Eames is the forger of the group and in 2010 the comparatively unknown Hardy shot himself into the Hollywood in-demand acting spectrum telling you all you need to know about his top-notch enactment. Ken Watanabe portrays Saito, the Japanese businessman who employs Cobb with the assurance that he can help him. This is Watanabe\u00e2??s first fully-English film, and unfortunately it shows as he struggles to get his words out and we struggle to understand them. And finally, the freakishly terrifying performance of Cobb\u00e2??s wife Mal, portrayed by Marion Cotillard is perhaps the best acting in the film. Her femme fatale persona is evident through her diversified persona as she can be vulnerable, dangerous, buoyant and distressing all at once. She may be the most depressing character of the film, but boy is she the best actress.\n \nInception already has the profundity of emotion and complex intellect, and it doesn\u00e2??t forget to add the scorching visuals. Seeing as the film deals with dreams, a state of mind where anything is possible, it had to really sell itself through its otherworldly imagery. There are moments where you will be itching to try out the dream-state yourself and at times just flabbergasted by the potential of a world that can truly be yours. In particular, as seen on the film\u00e2??s poster, the physics of the dream-world is non-existent as Ariadne folds half of the city on top of the other half creating a mirror-like image. The filmmakers had to be selective in deciding how they could sell the potential of dreaming and to just fold a city in half is a sight for sore eyes. Hans Zimmer\u00e2??s electronically operatic score serves the visuals justice as it truly unleashes your imagination and almost trances you into a dream-like state.\n \nOn the topic of the very controversial ending in which the totem of Di Caprio that declares the difference between dreaming and reality still spins as the scene fades to black should not be debated about, but instead treasured for adding an ambiguity, or to put it better another dimension to an already complex world. Inception is riddled with depth and as a blockbuster, it truly goes beyond its limits and challenges your understandings.\n\nThe sheer complexity of the subconscious labyrinth created by Christopher Nolan is truly mind-boggling, and if it weren\u00e2??t for its dark intimacy and sometimes convoluted topic, it would succeed on every level.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        8/10",

Resisting encouragement to retire and save what is left of his sanity, Cobb is easily convinced to take one last job. Lured by the idea that this last job could be the key to his mental and emotional freedom, the bonus could\nsee him accomplish the impossible - inception.\n\nAssembling an equally unique team of specialists and constructing the most elaborate deception yet, Cobb attempts to reverse the perfect heist; plant an idea instead of steal it. Inception not deception. Could this be the impossibly perfect crime? Or will Cobb\nlose himself completely?\n\nA twirling top of mind bending information and ideas, this film is a scintillating exploration of dreams, reality and the hairline that separates them. Altering preconceptions and invading the only thing we all believe is simply our own - our mind - this movie's labyrinthine premise extends on writer/director Christopher Nolan's earlier concepts in 2000s, Memento.\n\nThe immersive world of schemes, dreams and dreams within dreams highlights to the extreme just how easy the power of suggestion can completely influence someone's being. The astonishing visuals seemingly overwhelm viewers; however as the film progresses, the chaos and confusion of the multilayered fragmented theory becomes acceptably absorbable. \n\nMeticulously focused on the establishment of films initial premise; the concept of how Cobb not only enters but influences the mind, is clearly defined. Entering whilst in a lightened dream state, Cobb and team can effortlessly morph reality as needed changing time, perspectives and perceptions.\n\nLeaving the dream however is a more complex matter. Piaf's No Regrets is utilised as an alert, a 'music trigger' telling those who have entered the mind that an awakening jolt, a 'kick' is coming to safely remove them. The catch is if anyone misses the kick, they can\neither be trapped in the mind or alternatively die in the outside world.\n\nThe makeup for this movie has been derived from a number of its existential predecessors. Clearly influence by the Matrix trilogy and 1999s eXistenZ, Inception brings a myriad of theories together in an ambitious physiological thriller that sometimes attempts to be a little too clever.\n\nConstantly attempting to establish and prove himself as a dramatic actor, DiCaprio tries his hand at yet another emotionally taxing film and once again missed the mark. Marion Cotillard is heartbreaking as the real emotional backbone, Cobb's wife and Achilles heel, Mal. Joseph Gordon- Levitt does a wonderful job even with some dreadful lines and Juno's Ellen Pages cast disconcertingly appropriate as the whiz-kid architect.\n\nThe verdict: Imagination, dreams, reality; who knows where are the line's drawn? And how to we cross them? Ambition is at war with pertinence in this film and the end result leaves viewers a little cold to its message.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 01/10/2010",

            "content": "What to say about Inception? First off, I adore this movie. Not only does it provide exhilarating action but, like most of Nolan's films, it never undermines it's audience. An intelligent blockbuster grounded in realism,Inception is at it's heart a redemption story.\n\nWhat's most impeccable here, beyond the acting and action and special effects and upside Paris and dream sequences and.............film, is how it manages so deftly to delve into psychological themes such as grief, loss and a sense of belonging. It's a truly visionary, astounding piece of filmmaking.\n\nIn terms of the cast, well, lets just say it's stellar. Leonardo DiCaprio is yet again robbed of an oscar in one of his most moving, complex performances that demonstrate what a spectacularly brilliant actor he is. His ability to balance the complexities of the dream world with the pain of Cobb is what defines the whole narrative of Inception. \n\nMarion Cotillard is also the best female lead here (narrowly beating Ellen Page) as the tortured, mentally unstable Mal. Just a little less impressive (just) is Ellen Page, whose performance as the brainy architect is so damn good that its a shame she doesn't work with Nolan more. Furthermore, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ken Wantanabe, Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine fill 0ut the rest of the brilliant cast.\n\nSo much works here that it's hard not to notice problems. Sure, there may be plot holes in terms of the dream sequences and it's debatable realism, but ALL films of this sort do. It's like you can't ever have a time travel movie without plot holes. It's impossible. The same goes for inception, but who cares? It's not like it was directed by Michael Bay or anything.\n\nInception is escapist, blockbuster fare at it's very finest; the pinnacle of creative imagination in modern cinema. Those who do not like inception, whose who criticise this film are the same people who criticise The Shining or Dr. Strangelove (yes, Kubrick films): Morons.",

The film have a strong visual effect and dramatic scene between a dream and reality.

This is one of the finest sci-fi film I have watched in 2010s and they have nominated for different awards, especially Oscars. \n\nOne actor who caught my attention throughout this film, based on their kick-ass performance, is Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

            "content": "Well hello boys and girls. Christopher Nolan's \"Inception\" is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. It definitely deserves to be in the ranks as the best 100 films of all time and definitely one of the best for the 2000 era. It's such a bizarre, unique and at the same time fascinating exploration into the mind of dreams and accessing a person's information through dream states. DiCaprio as always gives a very explosive performance in this as Dom Cobb, the man who is the most skilled extractor who can access your mind and go into the deepest levels of the dream world. The only problem with his character is that he extradited from the U.S. after his wife played amazingly and creepy by the gorgeous Marion Cotillard, after she kills herself because of reasons I cannot explain in this interview as it is part of the movie, but keeps on showing up in DiCaprio's dream states because he cannot let her go. The movie also stars Joseph Gordon Levitt in his star making role as Arthur DiCaprio's right hand man. Ken Watanabe who I love in everything who is the tourist in DiCaprio's dream state and offers DiCaprio a way back home to American if he completes Watanabe's dream state mission called Inception. Ellen Page from \"Juno\" who is the architect, the person who designs the dream levels. Tom Hardy from \"The Dark Knight Rises\" and \"Lawless\" who plays the forger who impersonates targets in the dream state. Cillian Murphy from \"Batman Begins\" who is the target in the dream state that Watanabe's character wants DiCaprio's character to alter Cillian Murphy's mind so that he can change his position and alter his position as the new power of super energy when his father dies played by the late Pete Postlethwaite. And then there is also the great Tom Berenger from \"Platoon\" and countless other films who is the uncle and godfather of Cillian Murphy's character, who Tom Hardy impersonates in the dream state. And then there is the great and everlasting Michael Caine, who has minor to small cameo roll as DiCaprio's father who taught DiCaprio about the dream state. I really love the fact that Christopher Nolan keep working with all the same actors he works with in the past especially Michael Caine who he has worked with six times already and that includes Chris Nolan's latest feature \"Interstellar.\" I love watching the same actor and director work with each other I just get such a buzz off it like when I watch DeNiro and Scorsese, or DiCaprio and Scorsese for that matter, even Quentin Tarantino and Samuel L. Jackson it's just such an electrifying feel for me\n as a movie buff. There are several layers of the dream state that the cast goes through in this movie in order to alter Cillian Murphy's mind, but I am not going into all that now as it will literally take me for ever to go into, but I will say the one thing that really makes \"Inception\" work besides Chris Nolan's superb direction is Hans Zimmer's haunting and intense score. He literally is my favorite composer as I love the score he does for the Batman movies, Terrence Malick's \"The Thing Red Line,\" the man is truly one of the greatest composers of our time. The one thing that truly shocked me though watching \"Inception\" besides all the crazy twist and turns, especially with the end that still has me pondering about it to this day, is the fact that Christopher Nolan did not get a Best Director Oscar nomination for his work in this movie as this is a movie that could not have been made by any other director other than Nolan as it has him written all over this movie. Just goes to show where the Academy is at today, but I really don't care, I'm over it as for me, Christopher Nolan was the best director when \"Inception\" came out.",

But no, it's just a fantasy movie about dreams. Really, it's no different then The Matrix. That movie was successful because of a fresh concept, style, stoic acting and ground-breaking CGI. And people who told me the plot was complicated must have seen a different movie because everything that's happening is explained like a tutorial cut-scene in a video game. \n\nWhat's great about the movie are the scenes of chaos. Very cool. And the actors. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is my favorite. I don't know if that guy sold his soul to the devil for fame, but I think he has an amazing screen presence. I can't believe he started out as Tommy on 3rd Rock From The Sun.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan has already blessed with his fair share of classics of modern cinema, offering us Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige and the incredible The Dark Knight. With each of these he has proved to be a master of his work, constructing entire worlds for the viewer to lose themselves in entirely. And in his latest work, this is quite literally what he does.\u00a0\n\nInception begins with an idea: what if our subconscious could be accessed and our secrets revealed through the medium of our dreams? What we are given in an answer to this question is one of the most incredible pieces of cinema to hit our screens since Neo decided to take on Agent Smith.\u00a0\n\nDominic Cobb (a fantastic Di Caprio) is a man with a very special area of expertise: steal ideas or secrets from someone's subconscious through the use of shared dreams. However, his troubled past and own subconscious make it increasingly difficult for him to succeed in this profession. In order to solve the problem of his... not quite legal past, he is given one last job to do: inception; planting an idea inside someone's mind, an idea majoritively believed to be impossible. As he and his team go about trying to achieve this, they become increasingly aware that this job might just be known as impossible for a reason.\u00a0\n\nLet's start with the script. It's not quite as playful as the Batman films, so don't expect to be laughing too much; you really won't. The moments of comedy in there are funny, however, so it's not that the comedy falls flat, it's just that comedy isn't as necessary, nor as warranted, in this film. It is, however, as with most Nolan projects, distinctively Nolan. He walks the very, very fine line between the restriction of realism and the streams of uninterrupted dialogue of a Tarantino film beautifully, giving some very quotable lines but being restrained in terms of dialogue in general. Basically, being very clever in terms of what it does and does not say but without flaunting the fact. The intense moments are good and intense and the heartbreaking scenes are nothing short of their mark. It will definitely take a few screenings before a full appreciation for its subtlety and depth is reached, but after watching it once, I don't think anyone would mind a second viewing.\u00a0\n\nNow to the acting. Our main man Di Caprio is aMAZing he is a rock, our anchor in this visual storm which keeps the entire film grounded. This isn't the sort of role, nor the sort of acting, which wins an Oscar. There is no scenery chewing, no intense crying sequences to impress the academy with. But he plays his role so very well. He shows every emotion that Cobb feels, his indecision, his fear, his guilt, without feeling broody or one-dimensional. And the supporting cast is incredible as well, especially Ellen Page playing the newbie to the group outstandingly. Her fear for the program is palpable, as well as her fear of Cobb himself. Marion Cotillard is astonishing in her role. She is as disarming as she is villainess and as lovely yet dark as you would imagine her to be. She is a perfect casting choice for this film and her role is yet another example of why she's incredible. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great as the not-quite-reliable sidekick who seems to be loyal yet unsure of his partner in crime.\u00a0\n\nHanz Zimmer has proved himself, once again, to be a pioneer in the field of score creation. His menacing, dark blasts of primeval sound which make up the films' soundtrack are inspired. They add an extra level of malevolence which takes the film to a entirely new level.\u00a0\n\nNow, onto Mr. Nolan. The only real word for his work in this film is mindblowing, and that word has been bandied about a lot lately, but its true meaning is revealed after watching this film. We go from beautiful, intricately intimate close-ups which perfectly capture the inner workings of our lead's mind, to jaw-dropping wide-scale as buildings crumble into the ocean, avalanches rage down mountain sides, cities fold up on themselves and vans fly off the edge of bridges. It is a truly immense scale upon which Nolan unfolds his drama, but that's to be expected of the Dark Knight visionary. The special effects are flawless; not one frame looks out of place, despite the incredulous nature of the images being displayed. But the incredible thing about the extravagant images and amazing set pieces is the way that Nolan uses them. They are not stunts, nor merely throwaway pieces of eye-candy. Each and every one is used to further his story, expand the universe he is creating or to create a connection between us and the lead. It is a heartbreaking story surrounded by eye-popping images which work together so well. The tension which Nolan creates during the last half of the film is the calibre of a seasoned professional, building it slowly to a level almost unbearable. But the fantastic thing about the film is that Nolan is able to make the entire thing work to create the connection between audience and star which proves so elusive in many lesser filmmakers' work. You're never able to forget why they're going on this journey, nor why Cobb is so determined to make it work, thanks to the fantastic story by Nolan. And with an ending which rivals that of Blade Runner, he sums the entire film up both ambiguously and definitely at once.\u00a0\n\nInception is nothing less than history in motion, we are just lucky enough to be among those who get the first glimpse.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThe horrifying realisation of the occurrences in a hotel room. At once heartbreaking and gut-wrenching.",

It requires you to give your full undivided attention, or else you will be hopelessly confused. And I love that about Nolan, although there will be some studioheads who will be tearing their hair out. And this is the entire tenor of the backlash which I find to be a public announcement of stupidity but whatever. I must say love the open-endedness of the war-shot ink-blot tester of the final scene which left the entire unanswered question of the movie open to discussion. I laughed giddily and likely in a frightful manner because my dad had told me I was disturbing the audience in the theatre. Is this a dream or is it reality? It becomes a subjective interpretation. Nolan meets with you on a personal level. Are you an optimist or a pessimist is what this ultimately boils down to. And how easily you let emotional reactions and catharsis skew your perceptions. Don't let this dissuade your opinion, you have the freedom to believe what you want. But in case you hadn't noticed, the kids were both the same age and wearing the same clothes after what seems to be several years that have passed by.

We are the ones who control our dreams if we know how.\nLeonardo DiCaprio (Basketball Diaries, Titanic) plays Dom Cobb a man who with his partner Arthur played by Joseph Gordon Levitt (Mysterious Skin, Stop-Loss) are \"extractors\", people who can enter the dreams and sub conscious of the unwilling through some military experiment and gather information with their contract none the wiser. The duo is hired by Japanese business man Saito played by Ken Watanabe ( Memoirs of a Geisha, Batman Begins) to enter the sub conscious of Robert Fischer Jr played by Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Breakfast on Pluto) and get him to dissolve his dead father's company. If Cobb and his team are successful Saito will ensure the murder charge that Cobb is currently being hunted for (murdering his wife) is dropped and he can go back and be with his two kids once again. Cobb assembles a team ready to enter the 3 levels of Roberts's subconscious whilst he travels from Sydney to Los Angeles with the corpse of his father...\nInception is a film that if you look away for a second you are utterly lost, miss that one important sentence and you'll be left scratching your head wondering what the hell is actually going on. Is it a film that can hold your attention for the entirety or do you lose interest here and there and wonder what to buy in the supermarket once you leave the cinema?\nFor me it was amazing, so far-fetched and over convoluted, so much bullshit and crazy ideas, so much imagination and wonder all in one very messy and crisscrossed package. I have seen this movie about 3 times now and it still confuses me, in saying that though I do still love it as well. Every time I have watched it I have gotten more and more out of it. I believe it to be the type of film where if two people sitting in the same cinema met after the film to have a coffee and debrief neither of them would agree on the same thing to which they had just seen anyway, both of them would have seen exactly the same thing but come to two very different conclusions. I believe personally that's exactly what Nolan wants from his audience with this film, he wants us (the audience) to walk away and tell each other our own ideas and theories and walk away totally bewildered. For that it works and it works so very well.\nThe scenes set up in some of this movie are beyond imagination, there is one very amazing scene with Joseph Gordon Levitt's character that gives me tingles just thinking about it. Nolan is a very very smart man and no doubt has very big things to bring to the cinematic world. The ending by far is one of the most significant in the film I have my own ideas as I'm sure you will as well.\nI don't believe this is a film you would enjoy with anyone under 18 and then again even those over 18 without imagination and the ability to escape into a reality of complete amazement won't enjoy it either.\nInception gets 4.5 BanShee Screams out of 5 only because there is still so much to it I want to understand and can't without getting Christopher Nolan to sit down and break it down for me even though I'm aware of how much that will kill the entire film for me.\nThanks for reading Banshee\nX\n#inception",

It lived up to all I've heard about the craziness of the plot and amount of stuff going on, so I made sure I watched it when I could focus my entire concentration on the film.  The idea of going into people's dreams is hard to process, let alone going into dreams within dreams within dreams, which are populated by ones sub conscious and if dying can sometimes wake you up and sometimes make you basically brain dead in a empty dream forever.  It's a lot to process when watching, but it makes for a very unique and interesting movie to watch all the same. The visuals are top notch, typical for Christofer Nolan, and the practical effects make it all the better.  The action is far fetched to say the least, but given it all takes place in a dream, one can't complain or hate on that with much fact to stand on.  It keeps you on your toes while you watch, missing one second can mean missing one vital piece of information that will leave you confused for the rest of the film. But it's done to perfection, the acting is great, the story telling and explaining of just what the hell is going on is also very good, and doesn't feel like it has to explain it to the audience, but seems pretty natural at the time. It lived up to expectations for me, even if I cannot explain at all what truly goes on in it without telling anyone to simply watch it.  And in the end the twist ending has us wondering if he's in a dream still or not, and when he could have been put into it, where, by who, and what for.  Very well done, one of Nolan's best films, and even still easier to understand than Interstellar",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's Inception is about a man named Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who knows a very profound skill. He knows how to create dreams and he knows how to steal secrets from minds. His wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) invested herself in these sorts of things as well.\n\n\tWhen you are in the dream world you can wake yourself up by committing suicide. Well all of this experimenting with what you can do in dreams messed with Mal's mind and caused her to be possessed by the idea that, even when she was back in the real world, she was still dreaming and that, in order to wake up and come back to reality, she had to kill herself. So she eventually did. But the problem was, she very carefully took steps to ensure that, to the public eye, it looked as if she was murdered and that her murderer was Cobb. Why would she do such a thing you ask? She did what she did because she wanted her husband to commit suicide with her so that they could be together in the \"real\" world again.\n\n\tCobb does not end up committing suicide with his wife and chooses to run from the law instead. In order to support himself, he accepts jobs that require him to steal secrets from the minds of various targets. One day, a man Cobb tried to steal secrets from approaches him with a job offer. This man (Ken Watanabe) wants him to pull off the opposite of what he (Cobb) usually does. Saito (the man) wants him to plant an idea in a target's mind. In return, he promises to make a phone call that will enable Cobb to return home to his children in America without the authorities arresting him.\n\n\tAll of the actors did a wonderful job of playing their parts. Personally, I think the actor who shone the brightest was Tom Hardy who played Eames. Eames served as the main comic relief provider. In second place comes Joseph Gordon-Levitt. His character (Arthur) has a playful rivalry with Eames. Leonardo DiCaprio was convincing as a man haunted by his trying past, Ellen Page does a good job of portraying the nosy architect who constructs the dreams (for a reason that is explained in the movie, Cobb can't create dreams anymore after the death of his wife), and Cillian Murphy adeptly plays Robert Fischer, a man made bitter because his father is disappointed with him.\n\n\tSomething I really liked about this movie was the use of slow motion playback that was used to show the difference in how fast time flies by in the real world compared to the dream world and how fast time flies by in different layers of the dream world. Another thing that was cool was a scene in the movie in which Arthur has a zero-gravity fight with the security of a hotel.\n\n\tOverall, I would highly recommend Inception to anyone that wants to watch a very thought provoking, intelligent movie that also has lots of action. It is a hard one to understand so you need to have patience and you need to understand that it may take several viewings before you understand the movie completely. Also, when you go to watch the film, read the poem A Dream Within a Dream by Edgar Allan Poe along with it. Love and marriage aren't the only things that go together like a horse and a carriage.",

Upon the frame the credits rolled, my mouth was agape - I was absolutely stunned by the breathtaking journey I had just been taken on, and I was close to standing up in the cinema and applauding. This is the most unique concept for an action film I have ever come across, with themes that are like a universe in themselves: dreams, parasitical ideas, the architecture of the mind, etc... The climax was utterly gripping; the kind I doubt I'll ever experience again. One of the rare moments that a film exceeded my (astronomically high) expectations.",

            "content": "I enjoy \"The Dark Knight\" Trilogy; they entertain me quite a bit but they don't stick in my mind like they do with most people, but I usually accredit that to my issues with trying to take a character like Batman too seriously.  Now, the hardest thing to ignore in those movies is the scope and the technicality of it all.  These movies would be disasters under the hands of most other directors, but under the watchful eye of Christopher Nolan, who is absolutely the best working director we have right now for action films, these movies that could be monstrosities end up in the favor of people all across the world.  \"Inception,\" is an example of a top-tier director getting to make his passion project the exact way he wants to make it, while he is 100% in his prime.  The result is a masterpiece.\n \nA story that spans several continents, runs for 150 minutes, takes place in 5 different realities and has 9 main cast members, what could go wrong?  Thankfully nothing does.  Many viewers might get lost in the labyrinth Nolan has created with \"Inception\" and that is mainly due to the complex world he has set up and tries to teach us the rules of in the first hour so we can spend the rest of the time burrowing down an exciting tunnel of dreams.  There's no shame in having to watch \"Inception\" more than once; there is quite a bit to keep track of but with Nolan's script and some sharp work from his editing team, you are able to at least keep up with the overall story without understanding all of the fine details in between, which can be cleared up on later viewings.\n \nIt was good to see Leonardo DiCaprio take a break from relentlessly trying to win an Oscar with a slew of pretentious \"serious actor\" roles and just do something fun where he still gets to deliver a real performance.  He comes to us as Dominic Cobb, a dream thief on the run from the US Government after being framed for the murder of his wife, trying to figure out how to get home to his children in the States.  While not usually my favorite actor, DiCaprio plays a great leading man here and really carries the film as a whole with only one brief \"DiCaprio Freak-out\" about 95 minutes into the movie.\n \nThe supporting cast comes from a hauntingly beautiful Marion Cotillard, who plays the guilt-based projection of Cobb's deceased wife, Ellen Page, who is the newest member of the Dream Team, so she can ask all of the exposition questions we want answers to, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as Arthur, Dom's partner in crime.  The cast also includes a fun performance from Tom Hardy, who based his candor and mannerisms off of Christopher Nolan himself, so look out for that, and Ken Watanabe, a fine actor who unfortunately does carry a thick accent which is fine but he introduces the main plotline to us in his accent while speaking very quickly as a helicopter blares above him; I can't help but imagine there was a better take they could have used to get his lines across to the audience.\n \n\"Inception\" may not be for everyone; I often struggle with overly-long science fiction films but this one is so grounded in its own set of rules and reality that it is quite easy to believe and won't leave you groaning or sitting through elaborate space battles.  What we have here is a caper about gentlemen thieves with a splash of sci-fi to keep things original and interesting.\n \nMake sure to give this movie a chance, it could go down as the movie Nolan made whilst in his absolute prime, before he bit off more than he could chew.  Passion projects can sometimes be amazing (\"Almost Famous\") but other times the purity is lost in the director's head and they focus so hard on what they love, the audience becomes alienated (\"Super 8,\" \"This is 40\"); \"Inception\" is the former.  A passion project done right: fulfills everything the director wanted it to while also being accessible to the audience who paid to see it.  If there was ever a perfect movie in the last 5 years, this was it.",

Christopher Nolan, I always like his movies mainly because of those unique concept he comes out with, he is incredible, he is the actual person to be praised for bringing such a sophisticated story on screen, he managed so well that we get to find his hard work in layering the plot in very systematic way, he seems very peculiar in framing the scenes and the work of perfection is witnessed in each scene, to speak something about performances its 100% perfection by all the artists, Dicaprio is incredible, Joseph, Ellen and Cilian Murphy are great with their acting, it seems that director had given equal importance to each and every roles according to the plot, highlight of this movie is none other than its unique and new story line something like emerging of new genre, its an unique sci-fi flick, surely this is the great example for the creative imagination of the Human creature.     \n\nThe first half an hour it seems confusing but if the viewer holds the track and get into its flow then no doubt it's an amusing new experience of watching some great film.",

With each dreamscape, layers and layers are being piled on top of our main protagonist, and by the time his arc reaches a satisfying resolution, there's been plenty of development for the rest of the cast, who play parts equally as memorable. As the audience catches up with the film, each of its 148 minutes become all the more savory, and it draws us in so much while we try to give every detail all the attention we can grasp that we feel as if we could've gotten more out of this experience than we already did, even though we received more than what we would have from various average Hollywood blockbusters these days. Inception earns its right to pleasant ponderousness.",

            "content": "After consecutively watching Christopher Nolan's films, it seems that one of the fundamental reasons  why Nolan has gained such a legion of followers is that he always contains a balance of separate tastes required for a wider audience. From providing the great spectacle that the big-profit films require while still maintaining and never sacrificing an intellectual depth, it's no wonder that the directors fan-demographic reflects not only the general audience, but also critics, film scholars and cinephiles alike. And while most of his movies contain this balance of action and interesting subject matter, \"Inception\" is undeniably Nolan's opus.\r\n\r\nUsing the mechanics of a heist narrative, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a professional thief that  performs the art of extraction: the stealing of information from an individuals subconscious. However, after being offered the chance to return to his family, Cobb agrees to perform the difficult task of Inception: the planting of an idea within someone's dream-state (oppose to extracting it). While this is a relatively simple explanation of the plot, the execution of the narrative (like most Nolan films) is  extremely complex. Not only does Nolan employ the usual interchange between the past and present, but also a continues cycle between reality, dreams and memories. Moreover, during these various interchanges are quantities of plot details that explain the many separate mechanics that revolve around the dream-state. Although this sense of complexity is daunting, it really is one of the essential reasons why \"Inception\" has that everlasting quality -  its labyrinth structure is riddled with concealed secrets, even after repeated viewings. \r\n\r\nIn terms of genre, \"Inception\" is a beautiful amalgamation of the directors inspirations. The 'L.A aesthetic' influenced from Mann's \"Heat\" is still present from \"The Dark Knight\" with breathtaking city imagery and also some action sequences that are clearly constructed from Nolan's Bond influence (\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\"). Furthermore, there are many of the surrealist conventions that are associated with the visual representation of dreams in cinema. Although the amalgamation of these various genres could have been messy, \"Inception\" strucks an interesting balance between the elements of reality and the surreal. In one of the best action set-pieces that I have ever seen, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) gets into a tussle with a henchmen (subconscious projection) in a hallway that continually rotates and eventually loses gravity. With this set-piece actually being authentically built (Nolan has said that this particular influence came from the internal designs of Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\") and without any contribution from CGI, the dichotomy between the surrealist characteristics and the reality constructions of dreams are reflected brilliantly.\r\n\r\nWhile the layers to \"Inception's\" narrative could of possibly short-changed the leads, many of the characters - possibly -  turn out to be Nolan's best. Cobb is the directors typical unreliable narrator that once again reflects a sense of misdirection through the questioning of his perception of 'reality' (drawing many similarities to Leonard in \"Memento\"). With a fantastic performance provided by DiCaprio, Cobb is undeniably the emotional anchor. Along with DiCaprio, the chemistry between Arthur and Eames (Tom Hardy) adds the humour (both reflecting the classic tension between science and imagination). However, Mal (Marion Cotillard) possibly steals the show. A personification of Cobb's repressed guilt, Cotillard creates the perfect balance between demanding sympathy and being frighteningly scary.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the most astonishing achievement of \"Inception\" is Nolan's craftsmanship. Balancing the  interchange between the conception of dreams and reality would of obviously been a daunting task; however, the director makes it seem easy. On full display during the final forty minutes, Nolan guides the audience through four separate action sequences that are occurring simultaneously which eventuate in perfect synchronization. Essentially, even when there is action you have to pay attention. Adding to  the scope and quality of the film is Hans Zimmer's amazing score. Opening with the thunderous \"The Dream is Collapsing\" that accompanies an action sequence that cuts between three levels of dreams and reality sets the tone perfectly. And of course there's the beautiful melody \"Time\"; a musical piece that greatly adds the emotional significance to the end of Cobb's character arc.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, containing all of Nolan's traits on the grandest scale, there are many things to appreciate about \"Inception.\"",

            "content": "Inception is an incredible movie experience unlike anything you've seen before. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, Inception is a science fiction thriller that will leave the audience with absolutely no boundaries of constant thought from start to end - in it's 2hr 28min running time. It's a movie that requires careful focus and observance from the audience, as it's thriller filled with numerous twists and an unbelievably detailed script that's difficult to keep up with, if the level of concentration of what's going on isn't good enough. It's not the sort of movie that the filmmakers will expect the audience to understand right away; it comes with watching more than once and understanding the significance of it. \n\nNolan chose a great choice of an all-star cast to star, which included: the legendary Leonardo Dicaprio, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy and Michael Cain in a brief appearance.  Dicaprio plays Dom Cobb, the leading role. Cobb is a profession mind extractor, who extracts the subconscious mind of his targets in order to steal knowledge within their subconscious, through the dream world. It takes getting used to before being able to give the full explanation of what the plot centres around and the ability to extract the mind.\n\nNolan also had a great team of crew members to help make this movie possible, mostly ones he worked with before in movies such as the Dark Knight Trilogy. It was produced by himself and Emma Thomas; filmed by cinematographer Wally Pfister and edited by Lee Smith. Their work is well approved of and brings a whole new meaning the concentration of the mind. It was definitely worth the Academy Awards it won for it's technical categories and the accolades it won for other award ceremonies as well. \n\nIt's definitely one of the best movies I've ever experienced and one Christopher Nolan's best!",

Inception is one of Nolan's weakest screenplays. The people who think that Inception is a very clever and smart film are the one's who are being fooled by Nolan. The entire Act 1 was dragged and stretched and was all about about establishing rules most of which seemed to broken towards the end. In fact the rules just started to become random towards the end. The character development was very very poor. They're wooden, heartless and almost seem as though they exist as mere subjects of experimentation. The only 2 characters portrayed well were Cobb and Mal. The entire idea of \"The Kick\" doesn't make much sense. They started off saying that it was the effect of Gravity, the sense of falling that wakes you up. But then how is it that no one woke up when the Van was rotating and fell to a lower ground? How is it that no one woke up during the period when the Van was falling from the bridge? Why did the kick, kick in only when the Van touched the water? The introduction of Limbo is completely pointless. So if you're highly sedated, and you kill yourself in a dream, you wake up in Limbo, but if you kill yourself in Limbo you wake up? Why didn't they just think of doing that when Saito was shot. (And for some reason Saito had men working for him in Limbo as well.) The entire plot of taking over Fischer's company seems a bit too McGuffin-y. Inception took all it's ideas from an animated film called Paprika and unlike Inception, Paprika treated it's characters as humans rather than machines. This has always been Nolan's problem. The characters (in Inception, The Prestige, Insomnia and even Memento to an extent ) are so emotionless that you don't even care about most of them. That's what he got right in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. You don't feel emotionally detached in them. There's always a risk that these types of films may outsmart themselves, I'm not sure if that's what happened with Inception but of the back of a couple of extraordinary films, one would expect better.",

A stunning, ambitious mind-bending movie of art, that might not work all the way due to its over-complexity and a perhaps too ambitious plot, so the dialogs can be a bit too informational. But that's not something everyone will notice, and not something you should harken too. Because it's a classic sequel of the Nolan-franchise. \n\nPersonal rating: 88/100 \nCritical rating: 93/100",

            "content": "Inception' tries very hard to be ground-breaking but surprisingly I would call it below average. Inception fails in achieving everything that Nolan usually does brilliantly. Inception is one of Nolan's weakest screenplays. The people who think that Inception is a very clever and smart film are the one's who are being fooled by Nolan. The entire Act 1 was dragged and stretched and was all about about establishing rules most of which seemed to broken towards the end. In fact the rules just started to become random towards the end. The character development was very very poor. They're wooden, heartless and almost seem as though they exist as mere subjects of experimentation. The only 2 characters portrayed well were Cobb and Mal. The entire idea of \"The Kick\" doesn't make much sense. They started off saying that it was the effect of Gravity, the sense of falling that wakes you up. But then how is it that no one woke up when the Van was rotating and fell to a lower ground? How is it that no one woke up during the period when the Van was falling from the bridge? Why did the kick, kick in only when the Van touched the water? The introduction of Limbo is completely pointless. So if you're highly sedated, and you kill yourself in a dream, you wake up in Limbo, but if you kill yourself in Limbo you wake up? Why didn't they just think of doing that when Saito was shot. (And for some reason Saito had men working for him in Limbo as well.) The entire plot of taking over Fischer's company seems a bit too McGuffin-y. Inception took all it's ideas from an animated film called Paprika and unlike Inception, Paprika treated it's characters as humans rather than machines. This has always been Nolan's problem. The characters (in Inception, The Prestige, Insomnia and even Memento to an extent ) are so emotionless that you don't even care about most of them. That's what he got right in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. You don't feel emotionally detached in them. There's always a risk that these types of films may outsmart themselves, I'm not sure if that's what happened with Inception but of the back of a couple of extraordinary films, one would expect better.",

There are is many strings and ways the concept can go after watching it 6 times I always have a new theory in mind. I couldn't have asked for a better cast then this. It's perfect every character is natural and is a perfect fit. The screenplay is outstanding as well as the acting. Now here is where I might lose you when I say that the time put in this film to give it a realistic feel is amazing. Yes I said it this film is very realistic Of course I don't mean the dreams transfers stuff I am talking about the ideas revolving around the dreams the concept of dying in dreams and then waking up or the kicks is a very real concept which is probably experienced by many. Lastly the ending is amazing and Aldo the cinematography is outstanding. Overall from its concept to its crazy dreams this film won't disappoint and is a MUST see for good film lovers.

Sure, there have been sci-fi films that have touched on dreams before, such as The Sphere (terrible film, by the way, I wouldn't recommend it), but not quite in the way that Inception touches it. Here, you have one of the greatest phishing schemes of all time; you bring in a team of brilliant individuals and you steal information from people by inserting yourself into their dreams and getting their subconscious to reveal that information to you. Not only does Inception give this concept a run, but it also deals with the effects (moral and psychological) of the scenario. If you spend most of your waking hours in dreams, what mental boundary separates a dream from reality? It's revolutionary concepts and Earth-shattering thoughts like this that make science-fiction what it is today, and Inception is on the frontier of the genre.",

My favourite scene sees Cobb explain to Ariadne the world of dreams, and the hostile projections that fill the landscapes, and the architectural designs are a marvel with special effects unlike any other. Watching the cafe' become surrounded by exploding objects left me with the same expression that Ellen Page pulls at this moment. The action sequences are spectacular and different to anything else out there, as the scenes cut back and forth between the dreaming extractors and the moments where they are inside the unconscious, there's a heck of a lot of creativity here and thought provoking ideas. The performances are fine thanks to a dependable cast and the writing is undeniably detailed, Inception is thrilling and worthy of a watch.",

            "content": "Included In Lists:\nGreat Movies\n\nInception demonstrates the complexity of our minds, and that dreams are the gateway to our own subconscious. The subconscious is an area of our mind that consists of things that defines us but it is an area we can't seem to fully understand. It shapes our emotions, reactions, actions, goals, connections, thoughts and understanding. The subconscious' influence is so strong that it not only hurts ourselves, but also the people around us. Inception captures that idea so well, that it requires us to watch it over and over again to gain a complete understanding of it. Sometimes its complexity would require us to take elements of the film one layer at a time as trying to understand it while taking everything in may be too much in one sitting. It has only been roughly around 4 years since the film's release and its impact on its audience has already established itself. It's clich\u00e9 to say that a film is an instant classic, but that is what this film is.\n\nThe film was written by Christopher Nolan, and he has created a film that has opened our eyes to, or brought us closer in figuring out, the process of our subconscious and the dreams that are created because of it. Nolan does this in a way that serves only for the plot, it rarely ever felt like it was a lecture. The plot is quite easy to follow due to the story being goal oriented, and the film's narrative is not as fragmented as Memento or The Prestige. The film's intricacies are in its idea and it requires careful attention and multiple viewings in order for us to understand it and be satisfied. At first I felt, the level system felt too much like a video game and nothing interesting particularly happens especially during the third level, but as I kept revisiting the film, I started to find deeper themes and ideas to grasp onto, allowing me to see more of what these levels had to offer. Almost every single scene of this film is present to drive the film along, and rarely takes a breather from the mission. When it does take a break it's there to bring us closer to our protagonist and his psychological issues that may hurt his teammates along the way. I found this exploration of the character to be fascinating as it brings in familiar themes of grief and guilt and having it be wrapped in an interesting concept; going deeper in a person than we are normally accustomed to. While going through this personal journey, Nolan allows us to have a second person in the protagonist's journey, Ariadne, to represent us; trying to understand his feelings and supporting him in getting past it. There are a couple of people who might be a bit dissatisfied with the lack in connection with the film's characters, as they can easily be seen as just pieces of a game, but if one really invests themselves to the issues of our protagonist then they may be surprised on how much character development this film actually offers. The film lacks exploration on other characters, Nolan makes up for it by giving them each a personality of their own; tailored by the film's dialogue. The dialogue, along with their acting, creates these characters and reveals small things about them that make them so interesting and fun to watch. The film ends in a way that is similar to his previous films, notably Memento and The Prestige, where we are left with something ambiguous. Nolan didn't want the ending to be too easy for us, but yet he never makes us feel stupid for not getting it. It feels more like he is encouraging us to think and decide for ourselves with what we are left with.\n\nInception would be Christopher Nolan 7th feature film and arguably one of his best. I found this film to be much stronger than his previous film, The Dark Knight, as it equally provides the thrills and excitement that The Dark Knight had to offer but giving us something more original and thought provoking. I am impressed with Nolan's ability to handle something this complex and still manages to come out clean at the end of it, as he doesn't make us feel inferior for not understanding it. Nolan provides a sense of balance, by giving us the wonderment and ambition found in films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, and combining it with the fundamental thrills and accessibility found commonly in mainstream cinema. Without one or the other, this film would have ended up being either shallow or incoherent. This balance also prevents this film from seeming too indulgent in its writing. Nolan has simply created something ambitious but allows it to be within reach, this is something that is also achieved recently by Alfonso Cuaron in his film \"Gravity\". Nolan was also able to establish high stakes in the film's mission; creating a tense and gripping thriller. The film moves quite fast, as I have said before, with almost all of the scenes being there for the story. I think Nolan has spent a lot of time in the editing room with many scenes ending up in the cutting room floor. I think personally, this film would have benefited from a bit more exploration in its characters and sub-plots but I think it would have dragged on a bit too long for the casual viewer and may become restless. I found it surprising that Nolan decided to tell this story straight instead of the jagged storytelling that is found in some of his previous films. It was a great decision to tell the story this way as it would have avoided any further confusion/frustration from its audience. The film features marvellous action sequences, and since its release, has left an imprint on my mind. They are sequences that are so original, the gravity fight sequence and the manipulation of the environment's physics were notable, that it has left me in awe.\n\nThe film's director of photography was Wally Pfister and this would be his 6th collaboration with the director. Pfister is a great cinematographer but I cannot say he ranks up there with the greatest of cinematographers like Roger Deakins, Jeff Cronenweth and Emmanuel Lubezki, as Pfister never seems to make an impression with his photography, unlike these other cinematographers who leave a mark with almost all of their films. But Pfister does have the ability to create that sense of intensity and thrill, which make him the greatest choice for action-oriented films. The film was able to maintain my excitement and attention throughout, and I do think a lot of it had something to do with his photography. Pfister juggles back and forth between the hand-held camera style and the static (possibly) mounted style of shooting. This allows the film's pace to be controlled and deliver a stronger emotional response from the audience during pivotal moments in the film. Pfister, during stressful moments in the story, allows the camera to be constantly moving, following the action of the scene, going back and forth between characters during conversations. The film's photography, along with the help of the visual effects team, has created beautiful images, particularly of buildings. Pfister understood the symbolism of towering buildings and they are featured frequently throughout the film. The use of slow-motion can easily be seen as a misfire, as it often feels clich\u00e9 and lacking in context, but Pfister was able to use it here with relevance, allowing the audience to be in tune with the character's sense of time. The intimate moments of the film, particularly between Mal and Cobb, worked quite well, with Pfister capturing the beauty and intensity in the actor's performance. It's brilliant of Nolan to bring the most out of his actors and relying on their ability alone to sell these types of scenes, and not having complex shots or angles in order to sell the scene.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Hans Zimmer. I have listened to a lot of film scores from Zimmer and I have picked up on some similarities within his own filmography. There were tunes in this film that reminded me of certain scenes from his earlier work like The Thin Red Line. There is enough variety in the tracks that makes each one a tune of their own, but his trademark layering is in full display on both scores. Aside from that, Inception's score is breathtaking; it is one of the very few films that can make me get goose bumps when its big notes hit. The score goes hand in hand with Nolan and Pfister's imagery, giving the film the ability in bringing up emotions from its audience. A lot of the film's score contains this thunderous low end that becomes deeper and deeper as we go further in the mission. The score seems perfect when the film follows Cobb's personal troubles, as it allows us to feel closer with the character. When Zimmer's score goes in full force at the end of the film, it hits me hard, making me feel sorrowful but at the same time satisfied.\n\nThe film's acting was for the most part good with most of its praise belonging to DiCaprio and Page. Inception isn't heavily invested in its characters, aside from its protagonist, as most of them seem to be present in service to the story. Nevertheless they were great with what they had to work with. It would have been nicer if they gave more to their characters, but this is more of an issue towards the film's writing. The ones that impressed me from the film's supporting cast include Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Though out of all of the supporting players, Ellen Page was the one who deserves the most praise as she was just amazing in the role as this empathetic/sympathetic woman who personally wants to help Cobb overcome his inner demons. DiCaprio in this film was brilliant as he plays this not so perfect man who is acting out of desperation to get back to his children. Out of the two films that DiCaprio was involved with during 2010, Shutter Island was the one that showcased more from the actor, as it had a much more complex character for the actor to work with. In saying this, it doesn't change the fact that his performance here was great to watch. DiCaprio's best scenes were found in the moments between him and Page or Cotillard, as his battle with his own issues brought out the best from the actor, showcasing genuine emotion and vulnerability. \n\nThis film is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus as it features something almost completely original and he handles the film in a way that is approachable and digestible, not allowing the audience to feel inferior. It also features one of the best of Hans Zimmer's work and a standout performance from DiCaprio. Inception is one of the best films in the 21st century.",

The story explores the idea of stealing and planting dreams into people minds through Inception. The screenplay was great. The dialogue really pushed the movie forward rather than hold it back. \n\nThe cast characters were great! Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the rest of the team did terrific jobs playing their role. I honestly can't think of any other different people that would be better than them. \n\nThe effects in Inception were amazing! The scene where Arthur (Levitt) is floating around the hotel trying to make his sleeping team wake up was sooo cool. It really looked like he was floating around without gravity. Especially when the room would keep changing directions from the floor to the wall to the ceiling to the wall and back to the floor. \n\nOverall, Nolan really outdid himself in Inception.

Leonardo DiCaprio, you are the man! In some cases, however, if you were to watch this movie for the very first time without knowing anything about the storyline, you are indeed to get lost easily without fully understanding the meaning of why this movie did this and did that. But if you  were to watch Inception (2010) again, you are indeed to understand at least a little more of it than you did watching it the first. Leonardo DiCaprio has brought us a great movie to watch and to fully explore the true meaning of Inception and it dreams. Christopher Nolan did a fantastic job with the scenery and his choice of who was in charge of the movies soundtrack. Hans Zimmer has yet again impressed us with his musical skill! If it weren't for the music that Zimmer instilled in Nolan's film, the movie would not have gotten this far as it did. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Arthur) did a fantastic job in carrying out the acting as well. Keeping the mood serious and entertaining. I give this movie a four and a half stars, not because of its storyline but the way the movie was made to capture the reality in dreaming within a dream. The amount of work put in to Nolan's Inception (2010) was what made this movie become phenomenal overall.",

I seem to be the only person who doesn't really like or get this film. The film is about Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio)who steals information from people's subconscious when they are sleeping, however he is offered a new mission, to plant an idea in someone's dream. Inception is so confusing that I literally had no idea what was going on most of the time. The acting was really good though; Leonardo Di Caprio is a great actor and I usually like his films. I was glad Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in this as he's also a good actor and I have a bit of crush on him and Leonardo DiCaprio. Tom Hardy and Ellen Page were also really good in this; Tom Hardy was actually quite funny. \r\n\r\nHowever I just really don't understand this film; there's so much going on and so much to take in and so many characters. There's too much action and I just found it really boring. The storyline is just so ridiculous and there's no substance; you don't really get a chance to connect with the characters. I think this is definitely more of a guy film. This film is really overrated, I'm so disappointed. Inception is just as hazy, forgettable and devoid of concreteness like a dream and that's not a good thing. I didn't even think the dreams were realistic portrayals of true dreams, it was people resuming their awaking life, but in dream form. \r\n\r\nGrade: D-",

            "content": "If someone told you, you were going to be spending the next 2 hours and 30 minutes watching a film about dreams, you'd be forgiven for gearing up for a confusing and pretencious mess that no doubt has a twist ending, and while this isnt exactly untrue with Inception, it does what most other films about dreams, scratch that blockbusters, fail to even come close to, a riveting, thunderous and emotional beast, that flies along and leaves you going \"No way!\" by the completely unexpected ending. By now, unless you have been living under a rock or 40 fathoms under the sea, you will no doubt at the very least know of the existence of Inception, the film that was wedged between The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises in Christopher Nolan's monumental canon. Inception follows a man called Cobb, a professional thief, who has been forced into a world of the unorthodox of manipulating his subjects dreams, in order to extract essential information, from their brains, in order to sell to his clients. On one botched mission, Cobb and his right hand man Arthur manage to impress one of their subjects so much, he tracks the couple down and offers Cobb an opportunity he cannot refuse. All Cobb has to do, something that supposidly has never been done before, Inception, a process where a team must implant the seed of an idea in someones dream, allowing it to grow into fruitation, to change their future and which defines them. Cobb of course takes the job, for a reason I wont spoil here and as he races to assemble a team and actually execute Inception, we are treated to a maze of side winding exposition, character arcing, impressive set pieces and a multitude of philosopy and science. Upon release, many people complained about being able to follow Inception, as the films core mechanics revolve around our characters being in dreams within dreams, within dreams, however, what Nolan has actually done here is take what would have, in a lesser directors hands, be extremely unpallatable and made it accessable to a mainstream audience, while not offending people who dont like to be spoon fed information and concept and it is an absolute marvel to behold. The film literally weaves in and out of scenes at a break neck speed, the film maker inside me wonders, how tedious the script writing process and story boarding would have been. This film is just as complexly constructed as the Inception itself and its only on repeat viewings, you are able to marvel at its wonderful structure of many layers. The cast first of all, is literally what many independent directors would call a wet dream, however for Nolan, something of this caliber is of the norm. Leonardo Dicaprio, Tom Hardy, Ellen Paige, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphey, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Tom Berenger and Marion Cotillard make up a fantastic cast that are all on top of their game, I wouldnt go as far as to say any of these actors do their best work in this film, however its extremely close. The genius with Inception's cast is their ability to work as part of such a large ensemble, be completely believable and convey all the subtle emotions needed to make this jolt at the heart strings, while injecting comedy at every turn. Usually with large casts like this, the bigger message can be lost, however here, every single actor is important and completely aware of the end result. Leo as Cobb, could be slandered, unfairly, for pulling out something similar to Shutter Island, which was also released in the same year, but doing so would be extremely unfair. He is one of the greatest actors of our time, like it or not, he is an intense character actor, one that is so good, you dont know he is acting and that makes him perfect for this role. You buy into his psychological intensity, you buy into his emotional reasoning, you buy into his intelligence and its all because of Leo's power to really carry a film on his own back, if Inception had got this casting wrong, it would have completely crumbled at the foundations, however Leo totally rams it home, while allowing his supporting actors to thrive and at points outshine him. Levitt had always been a heart throb full of cheek and carisma, however here he gets to really cement himself as Arthur, Leo's most trusted colleague, who acts as Cobb's sensible concious. Arthur is constantly trying to help Cobb survive, however he cant control him and he knows it, however Levitt, really sells the actions, he sells the relationship and he is completely under rated within this film. Ellen Paige also gets a wonderful part to play as Ariadne, a young, budding architect, who is forced to construct the mazes, that Cobb's team need in order to implant Inception within their victims mind. This could have easily been a throwaway character, but here Nolan gives her so much more to do, allowing her to act as the audiences gateway into Cobb's psyche, she also acts like a form of reason and Cobb takes massive risks with her, due to his trusting nature and his admiration of her character. Paige nails it as a younger character, walking into the worlds biggest play ground, she is reckless, however completely enveloped in the dream world. Other cast members add a wealth of strength behind the ensemble Watanabe, Berenger and Caine really nail what they are given to work with, but the some of the films best work, apart from Leo, comes from Hardy, Cotillard and of course Murphey. Hardy is so lovable as Eaves, someone Cobb must entrust to morph into the subjects most trusted family member and having a method actor like Hardy, take on this role, is a stroke of genius, it also really enthralls as his frayed relationship with Arthur continually brings comic relief. Talking about the subject, Murphy is wonderful as Fischer Jr, the son of a wealthy entrepeneur on his death bed, who he believes his father resented his very existance for his entire life. He plays the part in such a way only Murphy could and the result is a stroke of genius. Cotillard is however one of Inceptions unsung heroes, its extremely hard to give a detailled account of her character without ruining some form of plot, but all you need to know is that she is frighteningly thunderous as an extremely important character, within this puzzle. The script is brilliantly constructed, it interlaces the philosphies of life, the subconcious, love, longing, experimentation, addiction, psychosis, science, trust, friendship, abuse, manipulation, corruption... I could go on all day, but the dialogue is never yawn inducing, it never bores you with its themes, instead it gives you all you need to know to advance the plot at any given time, allowing the actors to input their own colour onto the palette. As mentioned earlier, its difficult to conceive how Nolan actually wrote this script, Inception bounces all over the place, from actual events across the globe at any given time, deep into multi layered dreams and its completely evident that he must have put a tremendous amount of time and effort into this one. I can just imagine him sitting in a dark room with boards and boards of notes, ramblings and doodles scattered all over, in order to keep track of the overall goal here. Wally Pfister is also on top of his game here, helping Nolan bring his vision to life, he really manages to create a brilliant and semi original take on the dream world, while integrating a real life that seems just as similar to dreams themself and later on as the dreams become more adventurous, its clear Pfister is in his element, from massive sandy beaches to snow covered fortresses, the scale this man actually manages to capture is fucking jaw dropping. It also has to be said, unsurprisingly, that Nolan clearly has a fetish for 2001: A Space Oddissey, as he litterally steals a multitude of techniques and actual concepts from that film alone, usually it would be aggrivating but their inclusion is dealt with such wonder and with such a brilliant spin, you will be hard pressed not to sitting biting your nails as to how, in camera, him and Pfister filmed them. The editing also is extremely commendable, being able to hold the pacing and multi threads going on at any given time, would swamp a lesser editor, but here, the man responsible is just all over it, keeping cuts snappy, on the beat and extremely on the button. Finally Hans Zimmers scores are always commendable pieces of genius, but this may be his master piece, the score literally jolts the movie from brilliant to stratospheric, conveying so much emotion and scale, having another form of art slapped on top to really ram home the emotion of the piece is extremely commendable and its important for its inclusion here as at points its easy to see why some of the emotion, may just drown a little from all the contextual weight. For all that is commendable, Inception is guilty of a few minor niggles, that stop it from being a total masterpiece. First off, with any film this bold, its story can be slightly picked apart, there are a few glaring plot holes within the story that although dont effect you directly, due to the films sheer speed, upon watching multiple times, you start to pick apart just how capable this is. Convienance is the best example, at so many points it this movie, we the audience are forced to believe that so many pivotal events happen, purely down to a lack of coincidence, for example Saito, who employs Cobb after a botched attempt to extract information from his dreams, just so happens to find Cobb again and Cobb just so happens to be the only man ever to have achieved Inception, he also happens to be the entity that Nolan feels the need to throw off all the plot points or moments he cant find a resolute to, problem with getting the subject under Saito buys the airline, Saito just happens to be Cobb's only link back to home, which then is utilized to add tension by putting his life in continual danger. These are minor points, but they start adding up, pretty quickly. Another is Ariadne's reluctance to tell the others of Cobb's trouble and of Cobb to realize the extent of his damage, yes he obviously will stop at nothing to get home, but there are points when he is completely aware of his demons, yet for the films sake of tension, decides to be completely blinded by them, in order to further the films running time. I am of course nitpicking now but I cant help going, you know this would have all been over by now if they had simply done this or simply done that. All convienace aside Inception is one of the greatest achievements in modern day, blockbusting cinema, its big, bold, loud, fun, intelligent and jaw dropping. A wonderful film, toned back slightly by plotting, by on the grand scheme of things, it is an absolute must watch.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's INCEPTION (2010) is my favorite movie of all time, as well as the movie that actually got me into filmmaking in the first place. An immense inspiration in my life, Inception is without a doubt the epitome of awesomeness. This movie is an extremely well written, well thought out, superbly acted, emotional film that has become a milestone in film history as well as my life-hands down one of the BEST FILMS of all time. This movie is such a great feat-a cinematic masterpiece in my opinion-in terms of how Nolan executed storytelling and the astounding performances he brought out of talented actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, and Ken Watanabe; Inception also excels in all of its technical aspects too: score, cinematography, visual effects, and features one of the coolest action sequences that's been done with ONLY practical effects (Nolan is a big fan of practical over visual). As a matter of fact, for those who have seen the film, the hotel hallway fight sequence and the Penrose steps, among other parts of Inception, are ALL PRACTICAL EFFECTS. There were only 500 VFX shots total as compared to what ordinary sci-fi movies today would have: about 2000.\n\nThe film revolves around Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) a man who infiltrates a person's subconscious using dream sharing technology and then steals their ideas; a job known as extraction. However he's been struggling to find a way back to his kids, but the only way he can do that is to perform inception on Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) the son of a dying business magnate-all part of a deal with Saito (Ken Watanabe) the head of the company that rivals Fischer's. Unlike extraction (which Cobb is supposedly the best at), inception is the extremely difficult art of IMPLANTING an idea into the subject's mind instead. In order to accomplish inception he assembles a team-consisting of Arthur (JGL), who assembles all the information needed about the subject; Ariadne (Ellen Page), the architect who builds each dream layer; Eames (Tom Hardy), an identity forger who impersonates other people in the dream to manipulate the subject; and finally Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who creates the compounds needed for the dream sharing technology. What follows is an extremely complex, thrilling, mind bending, and thought provoking adventure into the world of dreams!! If that doesn't excite you then I don't know what will.\n\nFor those who don't actually know Nolan had actually wanted to make the film after Insomnia (2002) and the studio also approved. However he wanted to write a spec script first and then go back to the studio when he was finished... Except it took another 8 years to fully develop and craft out this ingenious screenplay of people entering another man's dreams, and essentially changing the man's whole perception of certain aspects of his life. I absolutely hate it when people say this movie is \"confusing\". There's a difference between a confusing movie and a movie that MAKES THE AUDIENCE THINK. Also, the characters actually do explain practically everything one would need to know to follow their mission. It is NOT confusing.\n\nDiCaprio gives one of his best performances ever as this grief stricken man with a mysterious past who is attempting to do what many would deem impossible. FUN FACT: Will Smith and Brad Pitt were both considered for the role of Cobb as well. But, while I love those actors, I honestly don't think they could have pulled the role off as amazing as DiCaprio did. Cobb is a professional, but at this point in his life he's the most desperate man ever who is willing to endanger his team members for the sake of being with his family-and DiCaprio perfectly portrayed this character. I kid you not this is my favorite performance from DiCaprio, and his chemistry with the others was incredible. Marion Cotillard plays his wife, Mal, in the film who appears as a projection whenever Cobb is in the dream state. I don't want to delve too much into her character because there are certain aspects that everyone should experience for themselves; but, to put it simply, she was awesome.\n\nHOWEVER, one of the standout actors in the film was Cillian Murphy as Fischer. Although he's being manipulated and is technically a pawn in the mission, this guy was still going on his own personal journey in coming to terms with his frail relationship with his father. And for those who have not seen it... SPOILERS! The moment Fischer's father (Pete Postlethwaite) says \"I was disappointed... that you tried...\" and then Fischer opens the safe and pulls out that pinwheel with Hans Zimmer's fantastical score playing in the background.... Holy shit what an unbelievable scene, with a magnificent performance from Murphy! Literally my jaw dropped and I was actually on the verge of tears. Just... Wow! That ties with the hallway scene for my favorite scene in the film, though it's definitely one of the most emotional scenes.\n\nInception was also the movie in which I was introduced to both Tom Hardy and JGL, two of my favorite actors working today to be honest. I loved both their characters, especially Eames whose role in the mission was really fascinating to me. But everyone please give a huge round of applause to JGL for both his acting and commitment to the action sequences; he did almost all of them including the infamous hallway scene. I had seen Ellen Page in Juno before Inception, but I have to say I loved Ariadne over Juno for multiple reasons; one of which being Ariadne was a far more adult and serious character than Juno. I have to fight with anyone who says, \"She's just their so we can understand the plot. Other than that she's useless....\" NOPE. I believe that she's one of the most essential team members especially since she acts as an anchor to Cobb whenever he drifts away from reality now and then (of course she finds out certain things about him that allow her to be an anchor but that's SPOILER territory). I also love the character in general, she's more than just a proxy to the audience; Ariadne is an intelligent, curious, and courageous girl and Ellen Page gives the performance of her life here. Her chemistry with Cobb was astoundingly good and without her the film would definitely be missing something special. And finally Watanabe's Saito... EPIC! I loved him in this more than Batman Begins, but a tier below The Last Samurai (underrated Tom Cruise film by the way). His relationship with Cobb was really cool to see developed throughout the film and Watanabe brings everything to the role.\n\nNow we have to finally come to Hans Zimmer's score... To put it simply FUCKING INCREDIBLE!!! I cannot believe he didn't win the Oscar for Best Original Score. In the opening scene alone when (SPOILERS-it's so hard to gush about a movie I love when I can't talk about everything!) Saito reveals to Cobb that he knows he's dreaming and then the \"Dream is Collapsing\" song kicks in-how badass was that and the continuing action that follows?! I love every single one of Zimmer's beautiful melodies in Inception, and they were essential to tying together this cohesive story and bringing out some great character moments as well. And he popularized the \"BRAAM\" SFX and gave us \"Time\" which happens to be a lot of people's favorites (for me it's always going to be \"Dream is Collapsing\"). As for Wally Pfister's cinematography: remarkable. Every shot, every scene was beautiful in terms lighting, framing, etc. Also, the color palette for Inception is amazing and if you go back and watch it you'll see that each dream layer (on the actual mission) has a different variety of colors; this allows each level to have its own distinct look and vibe. Overall visuals in the film are spectacular.\n\nI think it's come to the point where Inception is now a legendary movie (coincidentally it's produced by Legendary Pictures). Even to this day we are still talking about this grand film, especially because of that AMBIGUOUS ENDING. Is Cobb still in a dream? Of course Nolan himself said that the ending is supposed to mean that Cobb has stopped obsessing over dreams... But it's so fun to speculate. Personally I say he's in reality, but sound off in the comments what your thoughts are on it.\n\nIf I've noticed any pattern in Nolan's films it's that he keeps increasing the scope in every single one of them. I mean could anyone but him pull of that quadruple kick at the very end of the film, have it make sense and look fantastic at the same time? Every time he gets more and more ambitious, and Inception could have easily been a convoluted mess. In all honesty it COULD have been such an atrocity; but Nolan flawlessly directed this film. No matter how complicated things got I still understood what was happening and was purely entertained throughout; without a doubt Inception was one of the best film going experiences in my life. Like an idea, the film has come to define who I am today. It had emotion, action, tidbits of comedy; it serves as both a sci-fi espionage, a drama, a high octane thriller. It's just... INCEPTION!! If you haven't seen it- Actually why the hell would you have not seen it by now? Watch it! Sorry; experience the pure cinematic awesomeness that is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece: Inception - 100/10",

            "content": "Inception demonstrates the complexity of our minds, and that dreams are the gateway to our own subconscious. The subconscious is an area of our mind that consists of things that defines us but it is an area we can't seem to fully understand. It shapes our emotions, reactions, actions, goals, connections, thoughts and understanding. The subconscious' influence is so strong that it not only hurts ourselves, but also the people around us. Inception captures that idea so well, that it requires us to watch it over and over again to gain a complete understanding of it. Sometimes it's complexity would require us to take elements of the film one layer at a time as trying to understand it while taking everything in may be too much in one sitting. It has only been roughly around 4 years since the film's release and it's impact on it's audience has already established itself. It's cliche to say that a film is an instant classic, but that is what this film is.\n\nThe film was written by Christopher Nolan, and he has created a film that has opened our eyes to, or brought us closer in figuring out, the process of our subconscious and the dreams that are created because of it. Nolan does this in a way that serves only for the plot, it rarely ever felt like it was a lecture. The plot is quite easy to follow due to the story being goal oriented, and the film's narrative is not as fragmented as Memento or The Prestige. The film's intricacies are in it's idea and it requires careful attention and multiple viewings in order for us to understand it and be satisfied. At first I felt, the level system felt too much like a video game and nothing interesting particularly happens especially during the third level, but as I kept revisiting the film, I started to find deeper themes and ideas to grasp onto, allowing me to see more of what these levels had to offer. Almost every single scene of this film is present to drive the film along, and rarely takes a breather from the mission. When it does take a break it's there to bring us closer to our protagonist and his psychological issues that may hurt his teammates along the way. I found this exploration of the character to be fascinating as it brings in familiar themes of grief and guilt and having it be wrapped in an interesting concept; going deeper in a person than we are normally accustomed to. While going through this personal journey, Nolan allows us to have a second person in the protagonist's journey, Ariadne, to represent us; trying to understand his feelings and supporting him in getting past it. There are a couple of people who might be a bit dissatisfied with the lack in connection with the film's characters, as they can easily be seen as just pieces of a game, but if one really invests themselves to the issues of our protagonist then they may be surprised on how much character development this film actually offers. The film lacks exploration on other characters, Nolan makes up for it by giving them each a personality of their own; tailored by the film's dialogue. The dialogue, along with their acting, creates these characters and reveals small things about them that makes them so interesting and fun to watch. The film ends in a way that is similar to his previous films, notably Memento and The Prestige, where we are left with something ambiguous. Nolan didn't want the ending to be too easy for us, but yet he never makes us feel stupid for not getting it. It feels more like he is encouraging us to think and decide for ourselves with what we are left with.\n\nInception would be Christopher Nolan 7th feature film and arguably one of his best. I found this film to be much stronger than his previous film, The Dark Knight, as it equally provides the thrills and excitement that The Dark Knight had to offer but giving us something more original and thought provoking. I am impressed with Nolan's ability to handle something this complex and still manages to come out clean at the end of it, as he doesn't make us feel inferior for not understanding it. Nolan provides a sense of balance, by giving us the wonderment and ambition found in films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, and combining it with the fundamental thrills and accessibility found commonly in mainstream cinema. Without one or the other, this film would have ended up being either shallow or incoherent. This balance also prevents this film from seeming too indulgent in it's writing. Nolan has simply created something ambitious but allows it to be within reach, this is something that is also achieved recently by Alfonso Cuaron in his film \"Gravity\". Nolan was also able to establish high stakes in the film's mission; creating a tense and gripping thriller. The film moves quite fast, as I have said before, with almost all of the scenes being there for the story. I think Nolan has spent a lot of time in the editing room with many scenes ending up in the cutting room floor. I think personally, this film would have benefited from a bit more exploration in it's characters and sub-plots but I think it would have dragged on a bit too long for the casual viewer and may become restless. I found it surprising that Nolan decided to tell this story straight instead of the jagged storytelling that is found in some of his previous films. It was a great decision to tell the story this way as it would have avoided any further confusion/frustration from it's audience. The film features marvelous action sequences, and since it's release, has left an imprint on my mind. They are sequences that are so original, the gravity fight sequence and the manipulation of the environment's physics were notable, that it has left me in awe.\n\nThe film's director of photography was Wally Pfister and this would be his 6th collaboration with the director. Pfister is a great cinematographer but I cannot say he ranks up there with the greatest of cinematographers like Roger Deakins, Jeff Cronenweth and Emmanuel Lubezki, as Pfister never seems to make an impression with his photography, unlike these other cinematographers who leave a mark with almost all of their films. But Pfister does have the ability to create that sense of intensity and thrill, which make him the greatest choice for action-oriented films. The film was able to maintain my excitement and attention throughout, and I do think a lot of it had something to do with his photography. Pfister juggles back and forth between the hand-held camera style and the static (possibly) mounted style of shooting. This allows the film's pace to be controlled and deliver a stronger emotional response from the audience during pivotal moments in the film. Pfister, during stressful moments in the story, allows the camera to be constantly moving, following the action of the scene, going back and forth between characters during conversations. The film's photography, along with the help of the visual effects team, has created beautiful images, particularly of buildings. Pfister understood the symbolism of towering buildings and they are featured frequently throughout the film. The use of slow-motion can easily be seen as a misfire, as it often feels cliche and lacking in context, but Pfister was able to use it here with relevance, allowing the audience to be in tune with the character's sense of time. The intimate moments of the film, particularly between Mal and Cobb, worked quite well, with Pfister capturing the beauty and intensity in the actor's performance. It's brilliant of Nolan to bring the most out of his actors and relying on their ability alone to sell these type of scenes, and not having complex shots or angles in order to sell the scene.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Hans Zimmer. I have listened to a lot of film scores from Zimmer and I have picked up on some similarities within his own filmography. There were tunes in this film that reminded me of certain scenes from his earlier work like The Thin Red Line. There is enough variety in the tracks that makes each one a tune of their own, but his trademark layering is in full display on both scores. Aside from that, Incpetion's score is breathtaking; it is one of the very few films that can make me get goosebumps when it's big notes hit. The score goes hand in hand with Nolan and Pfister's imagery, giving the film the ability in bringing up emotions from it's audience. A lot of the film's score contains this thunderous low end that becomes more deeper and deeper as we go further in the mission. The score seems perfect when the film follows Cobb's personal troubles, as it allows us to feel closer with the character. When Zimmer's score goes in full force at the end of the film, it hits me hard, making me feel sorrowful but at the same time satisfied.\n\nThe film's acting was for the most part good with most of it's praise belonging to DiCaprio and Page. Inception isn't heavily invested in it's characters, aside from it's protagonist, as most of them seem to be present in service to the story. Nevertheless they were great with what they had to work with. It would have been nicer if they gave more to their characters, but this is more of an issue towards the film's writing. The ones that impressed me from the film's supporting cast include Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Though out of all of the supporting players, Ellen Page was the one who deserves the most praise as she was just amazing in the role as this empathetic/sympathetic woman who personally wants to help Cobb overcome his inner demons. DiCaprio in this film was brilliant as he plays this not so perfect man who is doing all that he can to get back to his children. Out of the two films that DiCaprio was involved with during 2010, Shutter Island was the one that showcased more from the actor, as it had a much more complex character for the actor to work with. In saying this, it doesn't change the fact that his performance here was great to watch. DiCaprio's best scenes were found in the moments between him and Page or Cotillard, as his battle with his own issues brought out the best from the actor, showcasing genuine emotion and vulnerability. \n\nThis film is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus as it features something almost completely original and he handles the film in a way that is approachable and digestible, not allowing the audience to feel inferior. It also features one of the best of Hans Zimmer's work and a standout performance from DiCaprio. Inception is one of the best films in the 21st century.",

            "content": "INCEPTED!\n\nWhen I first saw Inception it had such an effect on mind that I was driven to keep thinking about this Christopher Nolan's masterpiece for days together. Nolan's movies make your brains work out and think and think more, his movies need your complete attention while viewing and this one is no different. Inception is not so difficult to interpret as Memento but definitely has more emotional weight than it. For a how-can-one-think-a-story-like-this screenplay by Nolan, Hans Zimmer's evergreen score, the astonishing concept for the plot, good performances by the cast, stunning cinematography defying the concept of 'reality', the ambiguous nature of the whole film and the way it has been put together and  directed it remains my as my favorite movie till date.\n\n{{ [[PLOT]] Dominick Cobb(Leonardo DiCaprio) is an extractor(information thief through dreams) wanting to return to his home in U.S. to live with his 2 children where his entry is restricted due to charges of murder. Arthur(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is his partner/point man who researches a  subject - which is a person from whom information is to be stolen. The information is stolen through shared dreaming where both Cobb and Arthur enter the dream of the subject and manipulate the subject who is unaware of the dreaming state to reveal information. There are many rules and should-know things about the dream state and shared dreaming. Cobb is offered a task which is thought to be impossible by a powerful businessman Saito(Ken Watanabe) succeeding in completing it will clear him of his criminal charges and he will be able to come back home to live with his children. For the task Cobb assembles a team which includes a forger Eames(Tom Hardy), an architect Ariadne(Ellen Page) and a chemist Yusuf(Dileep Rao) and has to tackle the memory of his dead wife Mal(Marion Cotillard) in his subconscious while dreaming. The to-do job is nothing but using multiple levels of dreaming to plant an idea in a subjects mind and the task is called \"INCEPTION\" }}\n\n Well Inception has so many small details that catching them all while understanding the story is an uphill task. In the first hour we are made familiar with concepts of dreaming and rest of the movie reveals the inception. The movie has no single perfect interpretation where everyone can come up with his/her own version of the story and that's the beauty of it. The more you try to dwell the more intricate it becomes. At the end definitely you will be exhausted and confused that you are bound to discuss with others or search the internet for answers!\n Among the some memorable scenes are a zero-gravity fighting scene, the ending scene with Hans Zimmer's music at its best and many Hans Zimmer \"moments\" with his dense background score. Inception won Oscar for Best Visual effects and I was trying to remember where did they use so much CGI? That's how little it was used and what was used, made it look so real that questions rose on the concept of reality. Also the Oscar for the Best Cinematography (Wally Pfister) was very well deserved. Leo DiCaprio gives a rock-solid performance which will be remembered for a very long time and entire cast justify their roles perfectly. Inception with its story by itself would have been a great film but it's the music by Zimmer that takes it to entirely different level. The combo Nolan-Zimmer never fails!\n\nOn the whole Inception is a phenomenon not to be missed! I am blessed to be alive in the era of Christopher Nolan and his masterpieces and for me Inception is not only his but an all-time best!!\n\nRATING:- 10.0/10.0",

But I must warn that this isn't a movie you can just sit down and watch when you want to watch something. If you need that watch something like The Avengers (nothing wrong with it, just great if you want to have some fun with friends or something). But in Inception every line of dialouge matters and you have to be ready to be invested in a movie for two hours. For some that might be a negative,  but for me it gets a few extra points.

And when you see the film, amazing script and plot lines. The script highlighted the film's conflicted personnel, the stolen idea of an only in-imagination story, and it's new idea of the now beginning development of society, the film locked a key in every audience's subconscious of ways to get open at final fun point. The film continues to twist in every ways that even the director can't imagine, which has it's high point being the best in every, I mean every consequences.

An ambitious dream of many, not to said everybody influences in effects world. The film hits it like a jackpot dream in understanding the targeted minds. \nThe film does suffers some unimpressed and unnecessary plot lines, but majorly, this is counted as the best fantasy film of all time, as well as Nolan's career of fantasy films. 96/100",

Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan is without a doubt the greatest modern filmmaker that Hollywood has involved in the past decade. His films are creative, filled with compelling themes and ideas, and dedicates himself in telling a remarkable story over stellar visuals. Every great filmmaker has their passion project. For George Lucas, it was Star Wars. For James Cameron, Avatar. For Steven Spielberg, ET. And for Christopher Nolan, it would be Inception, which will go down in film history as one of the most complex, insane, and highly original movies ever made.\r\n\r\nDom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief who has the power to enter people's dreams to steal ideas, becoming the ultimate weapon in corporate espionage. But Cobb has a lot of personal problems, which is affecting his Inception project; his late wife (Marion Cotillard) is haunting his every thought, and, accused of murdering her, isn't allowed to see his children nor step foot on American soil. With one last shot at redemption, Cobb and his \"dream team\" (which compromises of a talented cast like Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Ken Watanbe) turn from stealing ideas into planting one, a quest that could bring Cobb back to his children. But the more they go into Robert Fischer's (Cillian Murphy) mind, the more complicated the mission gets.\r\n\r\nI first saw Inception back in 2010, and thought nothing special about it. My initial reaction was that the story was way too complicated to enjoy, but the cast and ideas were great. Four years later, with a more appreciative mind on complex material, and the first time I've seen Inception since my initial thoughts, I can now say that Inception is a modern Nolanesque masterpiece. \r\n\r\nFor one thing, look at how original and creative the story is, particularly the rules of going into the mind. When you die in the dream, you instantly wake up. When you're in multiple layers of the dream, you need a massive \"kick\" to get out of it. And the detail goes on and on and on, and the result is brilliantly executed. In a world dominated by sequels, prequels, reboots, and ripoffs of great original material already executed in the past, it's a miracle that someone is dedicated to telling something 100% original, and create a near-flawless film.\r\n\r\nBut my original problem still resonates with the film, that the story can get a little too complicated to follow. When looking at the film, a thought came in my mind. You know, this is Inception. The plot's supposed to make you think. It's not like Nolan wants to go kindergarten teacher on us and make a Cliff Note version on a project that took him ten long, hard years to make! This is Inception, not The Wizard of Oz! Considering the complexity and the multiple layers of thought in watching the film, you got to give Nolan credit for creating a film where you have to think throughout. It's something that hasn't been perfected since the films of Alfred Hitchcock. And that's something to be proud of.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike Gravity, where the visuals were the star of the show, Nolan makes sure that story comes first, then create stellar visual effects. And they are some of the best visual works in the past decade, more so than Gravity, Avatar, and Life of Pi combined! When you have a film involving revolving hallways, buildings going on top of each other, a van flying off a bridge in slo-mo for at least 30 minutes, and trains going beserk on the streets, you know this is an epic genius masterpiece. To be honest, I have no clue how Nolan and the visual crew managed to do it. And that's also something to be proud of, as not knowing how to create something visually wonderful is always a massive achievement.\r\n\r\nCasting is something Nolan is good at, and in Inception, Nolan doesn't disappoint. While I'm not much of a Leonardo DiCaprio fan (mostly because the only films I've seen him in are this and that horrendous modernized adaptation of Romeo and Juliet), I must say I was impressed with what DiCaprio pulls on the table. In the first minutes, we automatically root for Cobb in his shot at redemption. Leap of faith is a major plot device in the film, particularly in giving DiCaprio's character room to grow in the continuing issue of his dreams and others. I'm surprised he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his captivating performance, but it is what it is. Tom Hardy? Awesome, nuff said. Joseph Gordon-Levitt? Great, as usual. Ellen Page? Well, considering she's not one of my favorite actresses, Nolan makes her about as compelling is drama as DiCaprio! Marion Cotillard? Wonderful, complex performance! Ken Watanbe? Enjoyable in being the overly-serious guy! Cillain Murphy? His most compelling performance, having issues in what to do in life and is the best performance I've seen in him, much more chilling than Scarecrow! There's also a very entertaining appearance from the always great Michael Caine. \r\n\r\nHans Zimmer is one of the most original modern composers out there. And in Inception, his originality doesn't stop! Considering I'm not that big a fan of techno-sounding, as proven in that highly overrated Steven Price Gravity score, but Zimmer always knows what to do, and his score is flawless, possibly one of his greatest scores ever!!! The unique instrumentation fits in well with the complex material of the film, and the main theme is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!  \r\n\r\nThere's been debate on what Nolan's masterwork is, Inception or The Dark Knight. It's a really tough debate, and considering I initially thought Inception to be slightly overrated, I have seen the massive acclaim on it, and with that said, Inception is one of Nolan's best. It doesn't top The Dark Knight, but with it's great performances, particularly Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, and Leonardo DiCaprio, stellar visual making, a genius ending that raises lots of questions, and original, thought-provoking ideas and one of the most highly creative modern blockbusters in the past 14 years, Inception comes really, really close. It's great that the Academy recognized Nolan for his phenomenal work on Inception, considering all the Oscars it won, after the massive snubs they gave on all three Batman films combined, but with the upcoming Interstellar looking to be another original masterpiece as Inception, it's safe to say that hopefully, he'll have a Best Picture or Best Director win in his resume.\r\n\r\n\"An idea is like a virus. Resilient. Highly contagious. And even the smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.\"",

In fact I was never sure whether I was capable enough to Write about Inception but here I am trying to do the most difficult task of my life. When I say those words I am not bluffing any bit because I was so moved with Inception that I did what I had never done before, I watched 3 shows on the first 3 days and with each viewing ever since I have read the story in newer lights and to me that's the beauty of Inception.\nI am one of the biggest fan of the great Christopher Nolan so much so that I was always a subject to taunt among my peers, but none the less I feel he is one of the best storyteller of the recent years and I can go on lengths to prove that. Now having said that Inception in my view is the best film he has done yet. I mean yes he did some great experiment with Memento & the screenplay in The Prestige was fascinating, and the Batmen has found his redemption through him but in Inception the master has outdone himself. Be it the story, characterisation, screenplay, acting or action everything is just so breathtaking & besides all it is everything for every kind of viewers. Be it the intellectual stuff or the action required for a perfect summer blockbuster.\n\n \n\nInception is a crime thriller mostly dealing with our dreams. Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb is the Con artist here who can extract anything from your subconscious mind in dreams. It's a story of a major hiest through which Dom finds redemption from his inner guilt. The story features of a great cast indeed. Besides DiCaprio we have Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and the ever reliable Michael Caine in important roles and every one contributes to this epic. \n\nThere are particular instances which are so moving, like the one where Mal jumps out of the building and the emotional portions involving Dicaprio. Dicaprio has really grown as an actor over the years. He may tend to overdo the pain stricken characters but none the less he is too good at that. \n\nA special mention needs to be done for the effects. A lot of new things have been tried here and everything looks so beautiful. Be it the scene where the whole of Paris folds itself, or the gravity defying action scenes everything seems well rehearsed and truly breathtaking. The back ground score by Hans Zimmer is truly amazing.\n\nAll in all Inception to me is the best cinematic experience I have ever had and believe me I am not a novice in this field. The screen play is so binding, the characters are well built, the plot is mind blowing and the direction is top notch. So I am going 10 out of 10 for Christopher Nolan's Inception. It's my favourite film and honestly it challenged me to my wit's end to figure it out.",

            "content": "Years later, I still think this is one of the most overrated movies of all time. All concept-based and not based on heart or depth of character development. I could care less about any of these characters. Loved Matrix, Dark City, and even Nolan's other work, Memento, which many would say is also complicated and based on a new concept (though I believe Memento is much more intriguing than Inception). This movie is too focused on explaining and showing the dream within dreams concept and the worlds within them, that the character and story development are sorely neglected. I do not care what happens to the characters; therefore, I find the movie pointless. Besides the concepts it offers, it does not touch the heart. The characters do not actualize, and even in stories where characters are stagnant or regress, at least I care what happens to them, but not in this film. Of course, there are people who love this film so much and cannot imagine why anyone would not love it who claim that people who don't like the movie are either too dumb to understand it and cannot follow the movie, the concepts in the movie, or the plot. These snobs and bullies think that they must call anyone else who do not like the movie not intelligent enough to follow it. It's fascinating how these people think that one simply cannot follow a movie when the concepts and what is happening are clearly and repeatedly explained throughout the entire film. The constant explaining of why this is happening and what is happening is actually part of the reason why I do not like this movie. I wanted to learn about why things are happening for myself. You'd actually have to be really dim or simply not paying attention to not understand what is happening in this movie as it explains itself throughout the whole process. In the other three movies I mentioned previously above, the viewer has to more or less discover for him or herself what is happening on their own, without the constant explaining of the concepts. I believe the concept and the visual effects, along with the explanations and narratives make it a lot easier for the masses to understand this movie. I found it distracting to be told what is happening constantly. The ending was one of the few moments that I enjoyed, which was clever with the top spinning with the sound fading in the background, leaving the viewer wondering whether they're still in Dom Cobb's dream or whether it's reality. Other than that, I found the film cold, with superficial characters that needed better character development. The film should have spent more time on sound storytelling (rather than rushing the film and spending a lot of time on concept explanation) that would have made the film compelling enough to hold my interest.",

Surely, it is not as breathtaking as \"Avatar\" was, but that was not it's intention in the first place. It is just visually a great film.\nThe cast was also rather superb, especially DiCardo, Gordon-Levitt and Cottilard.

I enjoyed it greatly.  That said the one and only reason I'm giving it a 4.5/5 is the ending.  While the ending was a bit creative, it was by no means original and it made the film itself end on a flat note.  I had to stop myself from saying WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED!  Aside from the ending though, I can defiantly see why Inception received such praise.  The film features some big stars who not only work together perfectly but also put on excellent performances.  The most well-known of the stars by all means was Leonardo DiCaprio who continues to amaze us with his acting.  I don't think the director (Christopher Nolan) needs any introduction.  He's made himself famous in filmmaking for the past 10 years and Inception is no exception.  Inception uses one of the few concepts left in filming that hasn't quite met its full potential.  With Inception however, the story easily delivers some truly mind-opening ideas.  And of course what would a summer blockbuster be without its dazzling effects and explosive action.  Inception isn't just dazzling and explosive; it has some of the most breath-taking images and intense action sequences that have ever hit the big screen.  I can't think of many films that left me so stunned.  Complex, inventive, exciting, and super ambitious, Inception is that rare summer blockbuster that succeeds viscerally, visually, and intellectually.",

On one hand I appreciate the intricacies and just the pure scale in design of the story.  I enjoy exploring the depths of our subconscious in such a visceral and physical way-- as in physically jumping into layers of subconscious.  On the other hand, I feel that this style of storytelling is rather forceful.  Seems like in every scene there is some new \"rule\" to this dream world.  And as audience we have to buy it immediately, or else we'd be lost in the story.  One may argue that this is a device to keep the audience on edge.  The other way, the way I felt while watching it, is that-- I am your storytelling puppet, I will believe as I am told.  In fact, the whole movie is based on this preamble.  So in that case, if I choose to not dive headfirst into this premise, I could really care less who is a \"projection\"  and who is \"real\", who is sedated and who needs a kick, who is in limbo and who can be resuscitated.  I could care less who has \"subconscious security\".  The matter of fact is-- if it's all a dream, why does all the guns and the shootouts and the explosions matter.  I believe that if they filmmakers had taken out all the spectacles of the movie, it would still be a interesting story, or perhaps an even more compelling one.  The underlying arc is the tragic love story between Cobb and his wife.  The rest is simply eye candy.",

            "content": "Whenever tackling such a well like film one has to be prepare to face some backlash when saying something negative on such a beloved property. Thus is the case with Inception which inspite of a flawed execution of an interesting premise still makes for great entertainment. So be advise for anyone reading this simply because I point out flaws in the film doesn't take away how much you personally enjoy it. I loved the film when I first saw it, but it doesn't hold up on multiple viewings (at least for me).\r\n\r\nInception is about a skilled extractor being offered a chance to regain his old life as payment for a task considered to be impossible. The main issue with the plot is that it doesn't have any clear rules for it world nor does it follow the ones it sets up. The state of the dream world is inconsistent from beginning to end; apparently a van falling into the water from a bridge is a kick (a wake up call basically), but that same van flipping over on the road is not a kick? As for the real world....Nolan you do know DNA exist in the real that can prove Cobb's innocence right? I mean, you wrote The Dark Knight afterall. Oh right, the ending to that movie never mind.\r\n\r\nAs for the story being told it makes up for it flaws. The plot while nothing complex plays around with the ideas of dreams and it central characters conflict to great degrees. Cobb is a definable character with layer of depths. He's not the smartest of the group, but is the most personally involved. He's given the most development and learning about his past makes him a more compelling hero to follow. Several characters have arcs that develop through the course of the film that making them hold equal value in the story. The dreams are a welcome set up for plenty of expositions and intricate visuals. Learning the logic behind these dreams is inventive, but never explored to their potential. The dreams themselves are mostly confined in reality with natural imagery that don't demonstrate imagination as much as they should. \r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio never seems to fail in a leading role. He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Ellen Page strikes a nice balance of innocent wonder and precocious arrogance in her role. Gordon-Levitt as Arthur is excellent, but at times does feel he's only here to explain the plot and the logic of dreams. Tom Hardy and Tom Beringer are fine in their more diminutive roles. Marion Cotillard is particularly notable giving the film much of its emotional weight and giving sympathy for a mostly psychotic women whenever on screen. Her scenes shared with DiCaprio heightens the film story. The only weak link of the acting is from Ken Watanabe who speaks with a heavy accent making it possible to miss important plot points.\r\n\r\nIn term of Nolan direction he's a fantastic storyteller and has an eye for visuals, but the same can't be said for the action scenes. The action scenes are the weakest aspect of his direction since the camera is either too close to the actors in gunfights making difficult to see what's going on around them, positioned on bad angles, or editing giving a disjointed feeling. \r\n\r\nInception while flawed in execution is a bold attempt at storytelling. While I personally don't think it's Nolan best work as other claims based on what the film itself presents to it audiences. However, there's a reason why it's one of his most beloved films and resonate with audiences. Its original premise, visceral visuals, and many other elements that rightfully earns its reputation.\r\n\r\nMusic Trivia:\r\n\r\nIn the movie, whenever DiCaprio and his gang are about to wake up, they hear the song Non, je ne regrette nien by Edith Piaf. But you knew that part -- they never hide the fact that they're using that particular song as part of the plot. What you might not have realized is that you're hearing it even when you think you aren't. Remember that ultra-dramatic instrumental theme you hear over and over for the last 45 minutes of the movie? It sounds like a typical summer movie soundtrack meant to let you know that shit's getting real ... but it's actually that same Edith Piaf song, slowed down almost beyond recognition. The really cool part is that it makes perfect sense. The Edith Piaf song is a way for the characters to know they're about to wake up -- but since time passes more slowly inside dreams, what seems like two minutes and 23 seconds in reality can last a lot longer for them. While the song is playing at normal speed in the waking world, the characters should hear it all slowed down.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy theory on the not so smart ending (Spoilers of course):\r\n\r\nWe are told in the film DiCaprio character totem is a spinning top which spins forever in the dream world and topples over in the real world. My problem with the ending is that's it not as intelligent as audiences make it out to be. Why? In the film I every time DiCaprio was in the dream world he would have a ring on his finger. At first I thought it was a continuity error, but it turned to be something entirely different. You see every time DiCaprio entered the dream world he would have his ring on as oppose in reality he never did. Therefore DiCaprio his ring is the totem which didn't appear in the ending so in the end it's reality. Still disagree with me? Watch the film.",

            "content": "10 years before, Director Christopher Nolan wrote an 80-page treatment about dream-stealers. He originally envisioned it as a horror film, but eventually wrote it as a heist film. After pitching the idea to Warner Bros. Studios in 2001, he felt he needed to have more experience into making large scale films such as the hit 2005 movie BATMAN BEGINS and its 2008 sequel THE DARK KNIGHT. He spent six months polishing the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s script after he realized it needed a large budget because, in his words: \"as soon as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about dreams, the potential of the human mind is infinite. And so the scale of the film has to feel infinite. It has to feel like you could go absolutely anywhere by the end of the film. And it has to work on a massive scale\". Warner Bros. finally bought the script in February 2009 and with a budget of $160,000,000, Nolan and some of his crew members from The Dark Knight spent six months between June to November of that year filming his Action/Sci-Fi masterpiece INCEPTION.  The film tells the story about Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief and is the absolute best at what he does:  Entering into the dreams of others by thrusting himself into the subconscious of his targets, thus obtaining information that is otherwise impossible to access but it has also made him an international fugitive and costing him everything he has ever loved. When he is being offered a second chance for redemption, Cobb takes on one last job that will hopefully give him his life back if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Along with his team of specialists: Arthur, the Point Man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt \u00e2\u0080\u0093 500 Days of Summer), Ariadne, the Architect (Ellen Page - Juno), Eames, the sharp-tongued Forger (Tom Hardy - RocknRolla), Yusuf, the Chemist (Dileep Rao - Avatar), and the Tourist, Saito (Ken Watanabe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The Last Samuari) have to pull off the reverse of planting an idea into the subconscious of their target: Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 28 Days Later), the heir of his dying father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business corparation. The film also stars Academy Award winner Marion Cotillard (2007, Best Actress \u00e2\u0080\u0093 La Vie en Rose) as Cobb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deceased wife Mal, Tom Berenger (Platoon) as Robert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s godfather Peter Browning, Lukas Haas (Witness) as Cobb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous Architect Nash, Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects) as Robert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father Maurice, and Academy Award winner Michael Caine (1999, Best Supporting Actor - The Cider House Rules) as Cobb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mentor and father-in-law Miles. When Nolan filmed The Dark Knight, he shot it in Chicago, London, and Tokyo. In this movie, he shot in six different cities: Los Angeles, London, Paris, Tokyo, Calgary, and Morocco. Where in his words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhotographing different extremes from heavy rain to burning sun and to incredible snowfall\u00e2\u0080\u009d in showing the incredible landscapes of the film. The first time I saw the theatrical trailer, I thought it looked really interesting. I went to see it and I really enjoyed it. The best scene of the movie is when Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character is running around the walls and ceiling of a hotel hallway while gravity has gone haywire. Gordon-Levitt himself did his own stunts for that sequence. I consider INCEPTION one of the best movies of 2010. It is a definite must see from me to you!",

            "content": "There is only one movie I have been literally ecstatic about seeing, which is not something that happens to me very often. That movie is Inception. I can't quite explain why, except to say that the marketing team behind Inception managed to utterly captivate me with their trailers and strong attempts at keeping secret the details of what I am calling \"Nolan's masterpiece.\" Point is, the moment I heard about Inception, I was hooked, and I have spent the last three or four months waiting for what I hoped would be the best movie of the entire year, let alone the best science fiction movie in decades.\n\nAnd you know what Inception provided? Everything I could have ever wanted and more. It is, in my opinion, the best movie of the year and is easily in my top ten best science fiction movies of all time. Calling Inception \"Nolan's masterpiece\" is an understatement. It is a tour de force, a feat of monumental cinematic proportions. For those that had doubts about Nolan's ability to escape the brilliant success of The Dark Knight, Inception proves you wrong, because it is the one movie that I think defines Nolan as an expert filmmaker, as the kind of writer and director that can actually produce high quality original material and direct it at a level that certain other filmmakers haven't been able to do since the beginning of their careers (I'm looking at you M. Night Shyamalan). Inception is, to put it more simply, a must see.\n\nNow for my review (after the fold):\n\nDescribing Inception is difficult. I am writing this review with the intention of leaving out the specifics, partly because I think everyone should see this movie and partly because doing so could potentially ruin the experience of discovery that I received while watching it. With that in mind, I am going to steal the synopsis from IMDB to give you a better impression of the plot of the movie:\n\nDom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.\nInception is one of those rare movies that makes you think while entertaining you, something that doesn't happen all that often. Right from the start, the movie slams you head first into the complex world that Nolan has created, showing you how things work, how difficult and detailed everything is, and how much time and energy Nolan undoubtedly put into every aspect of the film, from the cast to the situation to the visuals. It becomes clear right that what is to follow (i.e. the primary narrative) will be a complicated, but thoroughly engaging event.\n\nAnd it is. The deeper Nolan takes us into the intricate web of his dream worlds, the more amazingly complicated, strange, and exciting things become. The progression of the primary narrative is smooth and timed perfectly (often for good reason) and the climax is probably one of the most brilliantly suspenseful moments I have seen on film (you'll have to watch to understand what I mean). Characters \"die,\" even important ones, and the more complex the climax becomes, building up like a spiderweb or layering like a quantum pie, the more obvious the danger that everyone is in becomes--one wrong movie and everything will come crumbling down.\n\nThe narrative, thankfully, is well-supported by two things: a fantastic cast and amazing visuals. The latter of these demonstrates precisely why only certain directors should use CG, because Nolan clearly understands where using CG is best placed and where using physical mediums is superior. Inception is a combination of both, in the sense that some action sequences are done almost entirely without CG, and others are not (the latter of these are typically scenes that simply cannot be done without CG). The appropriate lack of CG is no small feat. Entire action sequences that would likely be made easier on the actors and the director by reducing it all to a CGed mess are instead done with what we assume are expertly-handled wires and ingenious contraptions. An example of this is actually in the trailers, where we see Joseph Gordon-Levitt flying down or climbing up the walls of a hotel hallway. The entire sequence is brilliant, but even that snippet shows you just how important realism is to Nolan. He wants his vision to encapsulate the wonder of the dream, while also invoking believability; without that, the entire film would crash to the ground, because once the audience no longer suspends its disbelief, there is nothing left to tell or do but drawn one's own inadequacies..\n\nFrom an acting standpoint, the film is well cast. DeCaprio's (Cobb) slight dislike for science fiction doesn't show as he delivers a believable character with a troubled past and an emotional mission. Gordon-Levitt (Arthur), surprisingly, not only demonstrates his often ignored ability to do something other that \"teen comedy,\" but shows viewers, I think, that he is capable of pulling off action heroes. There was never a moment when I questioned whether Arthur was the right fit for Gordon-Levitt; he just seemed to fit. Ken Watanabe (Saito), who I greatly admire, starts off somewhat slow, but quickly becomes a fascinating secondary character, while Cillian Murphy (Robert Fischer, Jr.) delivers a stunning performance, despite having very little in terms of screen time. Ellen Page (Ariadne) helps round out the largely male cast with a strong, though not necessarily her best, performance, evoking a sense of maturity-beyond-her-years. She's not the only female character though, but I'm not going to say anything else about that. All in all, the cast is, I think, probably one of the best ensembles in a science fiction film, and possibly a good contender outside of the genre.\n\nBut now we run into a problem. I've said nothing but good things about this movie. In a lot of ways, Inception deserves it. From start to finish, it is an amazing film, but it also doesn't feel like a perfect film. There is something missing. A key, but minuscule component. I think Inception's only flaw is that its incredibly complex, though fascinating narrative pulls something away from the emotional impact of Cobb's story. The end, while clever and definitely emotional, failed, at least on a first viewing, to bring me to the emotional level that I think Nolan was looking for, and this largely because I spent a considerably amount of time trying to make sure that I understood what was going on (that's not to say that I didn't have an emotional reaction, just that I wasn't brought to that \"happy tears\" or \"sad tears\" place that emotionally powerful movies often bring me to). But this might also be Inception's strength, because few movies are built in such a way that makes the act of seeing it again in theaters potentially rewarding. Now that I know how everything works, I feel as though it would be beneficial to head back into Nolan's vision and allow Cobb's story to consume me. I intend to do just that this week, and I'll be back with an addendum to this review. For now, you have my first round thoughts to roll around in your head.\n\nDirecting: 4.75/5\nCast: 5/5\nWriting: 5/5\nVisuals: 5/5\nAdaptation: N/A\nOverall: 4.9375/5\nValue: $10.50 (based on a $10.50 max)\n\nP.S.: You absolutely must see this movie.\n\n--This review originally appeared on my personal blog, The World in the Satin Bag.",

            "content": "Following the dramatic uproarious chatter about this film after its release, I decided to give it a whirl to see what the fuss was about. Everyone on the Internet seems to speak of it like its genius. What movie were they watching, and how old were they, I wonder?\n\nThere was nothing \"new\" about this concept. It was just the only one full of boyish action sequences to pander to the demographic of young men who have little to no attention span. Literally half, kid you not, HALF of this film is pointless action sequences, and every one of them could have been shortened or omitted, and it would have been the exact same movie, only restricted to a more likeable time frame. The film rushed straight out of the box, dodged around its many implausible plot holes, and buzzed by so quickly to show you these action sequences that I was immediately lost long before the thirty minute mark.\n\nThe concept of \"going inside another's dreams and implanting an idea\" could have been a really great movie if they actually did more with it. The film left me feeling hollow inside, that they didn't push the envelope far enough. It just seemed like a lengthy excuse to have guns and explosions. I thought maybe it'd have a far more intriguing psychological aspect to it, kind of like The Cell, but not as shitty. I should have expected such nonsense from Christopher Nolan, honestly, but you don't need to have guns and explosions in your film to make it fun.\n\nThe characters were something to be desired. Cobb never spoke to anyone about his wife, never showed anyone his subconscious delusions of her (until Ariadne suddenly infiltrated his mind without permission), and yet when he confides in someone about it, it's completely devoid of any emotion. For someone who constantly feels guilt every single day of his life, he sure doesn't act guilty or morose over it. He acts more like a robot pretending to be human. Maybe that was the point, but I honestly don't believe this movie is intelligent enough to make a point that he might not be human anymore (regardless of its over-analyzed ending). I remember saying to myself that I wish the man would cry just to show me that he was a person. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I didn't feel sorry for him. He was listless and lifeless, just as I was watching him.\n\nThe acting was so incredibly overdone it made my ears bleed. Every actor in the film was making it so obvious that they were \"Actors\" and they were in a \"movie.\" It's the feeling you get whenever a car mechanic is trying to rip you off. You just know from his voice that it's not genuine. They might as well have said \"WE ARE ACTING!\" Throughout the whole film and nothing else. Everything about it felt fake.\n\nThen there was the story... An \"extractor,\" or rather one who infiltrates the mind through dream states, takes the job of helping another man buy out a company by manipulating the mind of a, broken, wounded, innocent individual, the now-owner of said corporation, who just lost his father who broke his heart by never showing him any compassion. I'm sorry, but am I the only one that finds that very mean-spirited and just plain cruel? I get that it's \"his job,\" but that's my point: Why did they make it that way? Why did they try to convince us that this man was doing all of this ridiculous shit just to go home? If he was really so great at manipulating minds, he could go home at any time, even with the excuses he gives. It just doesn't. Make. Sense. None of it does, and anyone who watches this for the plot and thinks it's \"genius\" has to reevaluate their perception.\n\nIf the plot holes were fixed and the action sequences reduced to less than one percent, and they covered more psychological aspects, it might have been better, and I might have actually enjoyed it more. Now, this movie wasn't terrible, exactly. I wouldn't go so far as to call it that. But \"genius\" it hardly is, and shouldn't be revered as such. There are better films out there that have a lot more interesting things to say, and those things actually make sense.",

The cast is well picked, with no real weak link lying in the cast it means that the audience is constantly engaged by their performances and can become emotionally attached to them. The script is brilliant with twists and turns that keep engagement until the final shot of the film and even without the actor's amazing performances the characters are well crafted and are all wonderfully fleshed out. Visually and technically the film is a triumph with great special effects as well as practical stunt work (the scene in the hotel corridor is a great scene) and the score by Hans Zimmer is energy filled and thundery yet dream-like and beautiful. After the success of 'The Dark Knight' its great to see Christopher Nolan do something he's always wanted to do and watch it pay off so well on screen. However the film is clearly not for everyone, those are wanting to see something with action and explosions will get that but will have to bear in mind that's not the purpose of the film, *cough, cough* Transformers *cough, cough*. All in all Inception is a superbly crafted film with every element working well together, its just a shame that Christopher Nolan wasn't nominated for best director for this film.",

            "content": "I last saw Inception as a whole over a year ago, but even so it remains fresh in memory, thanks to the endlessly inventive visuals and captivating plot and pacing.  Its construction is that of any conventional heist movie, though it is underlain by original concepts involving dreams and the subconscious mind, thus finding originality in presenting its ideas with such force and visual splendor that it is hard to resist and rewards several viewings. The story follows Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), who steals ideas in target's dreams for a living, and suddenly when his life crumbles from beneath him upon his wife's death, Cobb must do one last job with his team of experts, except this time, they are looking to plant an idea into a subject's mind rather than take one. The subject in question is the heir to a large corporation which the team is looking to take down. If Cobb succeeds, then he will be reunited with his children, bringing his life back together, and the other members will find peace as well. If they fail or die within the dream, they will be caught in another dream space, called limbo, within the one they are already in, where time doesn't pass and they could be stuck there indefinitely. The stakes are high, the consequences are real, and the dream could be, too. On a side note, the protagonist in the film, Cobb, is also the name of the villainous thief in director Christopher Nolan's debut, Following (1998). In this film, Nolan takes the basic character structure of the first Cobb (he is a thief and is persuasive, clever, and cunning), and builds on it, tapping its full potential and creating an emotionally and psychologically unstable man who is entertaining to watch and portrayed excellently by the particularly talented actor that is DiCaprio. Inception spins an excellent yarn and makes you think to bring all the ends together, and it is among Nolan's best works.",

I do not know about you, but I have, and this film shows you how.\nNolan (director), created here, a classic movie, with a philosophical touch and surprisingly, with action. \nI never thought that someone would one day make a film about dreams, and a director who made ??one of the best trilogies ever made (THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY), gives us another classic. A film that in my opinion is genius, show us exactly what a dream look's like, what we can do with it; uses intelligent arguments of how a person's mind works, with a fantastic cast where no character is left out or less important, and with a involvent and very intelligent history.\nWhere we can see a little realy secret agency that help people extract the thoughts and memories or implanting ideas in the mind of a person. For it seems strange, because if you want to like  movie as I did, you need to pay close attention to the film, or otherwise you will think it is too boring, or good but boring. \nThis film is in my opinion one of the best movies of our generation (and one ever made), and also proof that the cinema continues to have great movies and that will never die!\nPS: It could have been improved a little in the humor, but you can laugh a little bit.",

The abstract (a conventional set of ethical challenges , really) would have been realized cogently in the narrative flow. \n\nThe movie, though, stops again and again and yet again with a flashback, an extended pause in the momentum, so DiCaprio can discuss his feelings, make a another emotional breakthrough.Confusion and ambiguity were the working idea behind Momento, and to the degree that Nolan conceived his idea and worked through the variations of a memory-impaired man attempting to advance a plan of vengence in a present he couldn't keep in mind, it worked splendidly, wonderfully. The film had an ironic twist--a real one, not one of those cookie cutter conclusions that wallow in the irresolution of a conflict--which made the fractured plot coherent, finally,and illustrated consequences beyond what the hero or the villians could imagine.\n\nThe various scenarios at play in Inception, though were, of themselves , simple enough, but Nolan's problem was pacing and, sorry to say, the inability to make the characters connect with a believable emotion. The film was rather frantically edited , and the cutting between the three dreamscapes in the last third of the film were long in duration. The effect on this viewer was a loss of interest in a mission who's impetus was more hysterical than urgent. All this makes Christopher Nolan a lead-footed action director who is intent on turning the pleasures of pulp genres into think pieces and talky existential dioramas. \n\nEconomy is the key, of course, and decisiveness is the quality needed the most; conviction about the genre your using to get your narrative ideas across. A fresh idea would have helped , though, or at least a fresh approach on using old ones; Inception has deep echos of The Matrix, Heat and Solaris during it's length, the result being an interesting, if tedious distortion of what seems to have started out as an interesting idea.",

            "content": "Inception is a movie for people who really want to consume and digest all that the writer and director are trying to portray throughout the film. Through a combination of a well written screenplay and the creativity of the director, Christopher Nolan, this film was able to shape an entirely new way to engross an audience and expand what an ending should consist of. In other words, Inception is a provocative movie that needs the viewer to contemplate over its unraveling details and derive their own conclusion.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is a versatile actor that seems to really look at scripts to choose movies he knows will be controversial and stimulate the viewer. In this movie, DiCaprio captivates his audience so effortlessly through his emotional intensity and ability to make you feel what he's feeling at all times. Towards the beginning of the film it looks as if Cobb (DiCaprio) has everything together. He is a successful thief that steals subconscious thoughts from dreams through a process called inception with the aid of Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). In reality, Cobb is a wanted fugitive who wants to do one last job to get back to his family. However, this time he must plant an idea through the process of inception with the help of a team of experts he has chosen. It seems as though nothing can break Cobb, but as the team goes deeper into dreams the audience realizes that his emotions are held back in this world of wonderment that he created with his late wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). \n\nThe soundtrack and cinematography help enhance the feelings of sadness, threat, and suspense. Although the background music can be repetitive, it also somewhat sets the tone for the whole movie. The music brings a sensation that entwines the audience with an emotion that makes them feel the pain that Cobb feels. The special effects make the audience delve even further into the film. From the computer animated crumbling buildings in Cobb and Mal's dream, to the very real gravity defying hallway scene with Arthur, the special effects create a dream that seems to be real. Each level of the dreams builds up suspense for the end of the film. \n \nMany a people have said they didn't like Inception because it was too complex to follow and they were confused throughout the whole film. The purpose of the movie was to stretch the viewers mind. Christopher Nolan wants the audience to get wrapped up in the different levels of the dreams that these characters have created in order to generate new theories and questions right alongside of Ariadne (Ellen Page). I will admit the first time I watched it, I didn't understand everything that was going on and it left me asking questions and begging for answers. Thus viewers must watch the film again and again to really understand the beauty of it. In the conclusion of this film, the director wants the audience to determine the ending for themselves. He wants the audience to have as big of an imagination that this whole film is in itself. Inception is not just an action movie, or a drama, or a suspense. It is everything in one.",

Perhaps it would have benefited Inception if a clearer connection to some existing religious or other fantasy theme had been made. We can only speculate for now, but I do hope someone decides to make another movie with the \"entering dreams of others\" theme with stronger ties to some existing mythology.\n\nAll in all, these complaints are pretty minor (except for the aforementioned way Inception attempts too much to be an action/thriller movie towards the latter parts). I'm giving it 7/10, since it made me stare at my watch several times to determine when I would no longer have to endure more clinical action sequences without substance.",

But I'm here to tell you that with Christopher Nolan at the helm none of the problems I stated before are in this movie. Instead what you get is a fabulous piece of original science fiction. Let's talk about the acting first. Of course sense this is a Nolan movie a familiar cast is back,Joseph Gordan Levitt,Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy and a quick appearance of Michael Caine. With all of these great actors working with Nolan again you know the acting is going to be top notch. Also there are some new faces to a Nolan movie. One of them being Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes that pretty boy of the 90's is now a lead in an epic sci-fi. And how is he? Well, he's great. Not to get into spoilers, but, Leo's character is romantic with someone. But it's not bad, you don't start thinking that this is going to be corny and so lovey-dovey like Titanic, because Nolan keeps everything real in this unrealistic world. The romance doesn't take away from the movie at all in fact it adds another layer to Inception ( a movie that already has so many layers). Another actor that is new to a Nolan movie is Ellen Page, I don't have much to say about her other than she's great just like the rest of the cast. Now that I've finished talking about the acting lets talk about the special effects. They range from a mini war in snowy mountains to having fist fights with no gravity. They are just fabulous. You might think that I'm fanboying out over this movie, because I have no complaints but I'm not, it's that good. What Christopher Nolan does is create a sci-fi, thriller, drama, mystery and action movie all in one. This movie could've gone so bad but it didn't   Nolan should've won best director for this, in 2010. There's nothing wrong that comes to mind right now about this movie, so of course it deserves 5 stars!",
