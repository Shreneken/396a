Though they must rely on one another more than ever, dark forces threaten to tear them apart. Voldemort's Death Eaters have seized control of the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts, and they are searching for Harry -- even as he and his friends prepare for the ultimate showdown.",

Rowling's into two films, with the final one to be released next summer. The decision proves pointless beyond the obvious cash incentive, but director David Yates and his cast and crew have still delivered a handsome, involving adventure. And if it doesn't rank among the very best in the series, it's not because everyone involved doesn't give it their all. The cast continues to be marvelous, with young Daniel Radcliffe as testy and edgy as ever. Rupert Grint has never been better, and the glowing Emma Watson reinforces that she may be the one with the most promising career beyond this franchise. The A-list supporting cast of Britain's finest character actors continues to class things up--Ralph Fiennes makes a perfectly reptilian villain, Helena Bonham Carter is his devilish equal, David Thewlis, Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans, Robbie Coltrane, Brendan Gleeson, and Alan Rickman all make an impression. Yates, of the previous two Potter films, brings a nice balance to the proceedings, sprinkling in wit and humor among the thrilling chases (brilliantly cut) and touching moments. The effects are spot-on and the film is photographed with skill. Alexandre Desplat's score is splendid at capturing the right tone when needed. The pace is uneven though, as the energy flags from time to time. The best moment? A lovely CGI shadow puppet vignette that tells us what the Deathly Hallows are. The pervasive darkness and lack of much fun can't allow this to make the \"very best of\" list for this series. But so much of what has made this series terrific--the cast, the thrills, the magic, the sentiment--can still be found in this exceptional movie",

            "content": "Just for the record, I love the books(for a while Philosopher's Stone was a huge favourite of mine) and I personally like the films. None of them are masterpieces, but they are likable, entertaining and I think well made too. I saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 with high expectations, there were many friends of mine who said it was brilliant and the best yet. After seeing it with my family last night I have to say Amen! This was a wonderful film in my opinion, and it does a very good job sticking to a mammoth story. I also think they made the right decision splitting it into two parts, if they hadn't the result I think would have been too rushed.\n\nIf I do have a criticism here, I do agree that the pacing is rather slow. I think it started and ended brilliantly, it was the middle where it dragged with a lot of admiring the scenery. As beautiful as it was, it didn't admit much to the story.\n\nCriticism aside, I adored the production values. The darker scenes were indeed dark and somewhat bleak, especially the beginning at Malfoy Manor where it looked like a film noir, while the scenery in the middle of the film was gorgeous. The music was another delight, it was sweeping, grandiose, majestic, for me the most complex and most atmospheric of all the Harry Potter movie scores. The script is an improvement too, not that it was terrible in the other movies, but especially I thought the humour was better judged(ie. Moody's comment about the polyjuice potion), while the story despite the slow pacing was never less than engrossing.\n\nThere are a few scenes too that I especially liked. One was Dobby's death, I thought it was heart-rending. Dobby was so lovable and funny, and in this instalment cute too I think(loved the trainers), although I knew it was going to happen I couldn't help shedding tears. I think what got me were his last words, they were so poetic and touching. Another was Godric's Hollow, like the former I knew it was coming but it was done in an atmospheric and unnerving way I couldn't help jump. I was also taken with the first \"obliviate\" scene, the regret in Hermione's face and voice made it incredibly poignant, while the 7 Potters chase was both funny and thrilling. My favourite though was the Three Brothers animated sequence. I was wondering how they were going to do that, and after seeing that scene I have to applaud the writers. It was a clever and beautifully done sequence, with some haunting images especially with death. Harry and Hermione's dance got mixed reactions in the cinema, some thought it was awkward and others like me liked it, at that one I thought they were going to kiss which I don't think would have gone down well.\n\nYates's direction is also much better than it has been. It wasn't bad in the other two films, but here it looked as though he took real charge, and all the pivotal scenes here were in general wonderfully handled. The acting is mostly very good. Daniel Radcliffe is likable enough, and Rupert Grint has great comic timing. Emma Watson I think gives her best performance of the series so far and she steals every scene she's in, while Alan Rickman while not in much is deliciously suave and dour. The two standouts for me were Helena Bonham Carter, whose Bellatrix was powerful and sometimes even scary and Ralph Fiennes who was really quite creepy sometimes without saying much at all. Bill Nighy's Scrimgeour is good but not as memorable, while I do think they wasted the Dursleys.\n\nOverall, a rock solid film that ended in a perfect place and my personal favourite of the series so far. In fact, it makes me all the more excited for the next. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Dark and difficult times are here. Playtime is over for the Harry Potter characters, and the end has begun. Of course dark times are now upon the Harry Potter series, after the tragic ending in The Half-Blood Prince evil is now everywhere, nowhere is safe, and who can and can't Harry trust. This is not your typical Harry Potter story where it's another challenging year at Hogwarts. This time the film means business. The Deathly Hallows Part 1 is an amazing epic, the likes of which most Harry Potter's films haven't reached. It's almost on the same caliber as The Lord of the Rings. Also note this is the first Harry Potter film since Goblet of Fire that I am giving a four star review to, that says a lot! I've hailed Goblet of Fire as my favorite of the Harry Potter series, but I must say that I didn't expect to give another Harry Potter film a four star review, and I didn't expect this to become my new favorite Harry Potter film. I was truly blown away with full amazement with this film. This time Harry, Ron and Hermione are fleeing for their lives from the dark Lord Voldemort and his evil agents. People we've seen throughout the series are dying and are being tortured. Voldemort is everywhere and has even infiltrated the Ministry of Magic. Harry Potter has been made public enemy number one. A new school year has begun at Hogwarts, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione have been forced into exile and in search of the missing Horcruxs (the objects Voldemort has place a piece of his soul into). However, Harry is finishing Dumbledore's mission of destroying Voldemort, a task that Dumbledore spend the majority of the Potter series trying to solve. Now, Harry and his friends are left to solve the missing pieces, a highly difficult task, since they have little to no clue as to where to look. This is a highly suspenseful film. However; the film isn't built so much on it's suspenseful action scenes, but on it's characters, more than ever before. So many of the scenes in the film are driven by the connection between Harry and his friends, because all they really have right now is each other. I for one am very pleased with the decision to split up the final film into two parts. Films like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, scramble to fill in as much of the book into a 2 and a half hour or three hour film. I don't think too many fans can complain about The Deathly Hallows not staying close to the book, since the film feels like your actually being told the WHOLE book. We see almost every character of the past Potter films and see all the conclusions there are before the curtain finally drops. We also get scenes that clearly would've been cut just to make room for the final battle at the end of film had it been just one part instead of two. When Harry and pals are searching for horcruxs, they're searching for months. You get a strong taste of that feel by having the screen take it's time to show this tiring task. With so many scenes being able to take there time, you never get the feel of the story being rushed at all, something that most of the Potter films felt like at one point or another. Amazingly enough these scenes are not the least bit dull or sluggish. These scenes are carried by the relationship Harry has with his friends, especially Hermione. There is one very charming scene in particular where the two of them, after months of searching and thinking, Harry turns up the radio, grabs Hermione hand and dances with her. They embrace, not as lovers, but as two friends who have been by each other's side since age 11. It's moments like these that make the film truly rich and unique. The Death Hallows Part 1 has almost the strongest performances from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and especially Emma Watson than compared to all the other Harry Potter films. Or at least their best acting since Goblet of Fire. As I said earlier this is not the typical Harry Potter film, and I really dig that about The Death Hallows Part 1. I have been on the sidelines with David Yates since the so-so impression I got of him after seeing Order of The Phoenix. He was getting better with Half-Blood Prince, but now I am fully on board with him being the guy to direct the final Harry Potter films. The Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a richly beautiful film to marvel at, even with all the tragedy and death surrounding the story. Absolute outstanding cinematography from Eduardo Serra (Blood Diamond, Girl With A Pearl Earring, What Dreams May Come), who's cinematography really aids the film in standing out as from all the other Potter films. Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves have very genuinely adapted J.K. Rowling's finale into a glorious piece of storytelling. I especially loved the scene where the story of the Deathly Hallows is told by what I can only describe as shadow puppets cast on a cave wall. This is a very intense PG-13 film, and the most intense of all the Harry Potter films, but the film has more than enough room for fun and laughs. Shockingly I laugh more during The Deathly Hallows Part 1 than I did through most of the other Harry Potter films, but a lot of this is due to the fact that with this being the most intense of the series we need that laugh to make it through the series most darkest hours. Goblet of Fire marked the point where the time of innocence was soon coming to an end. Now there is no more innocence left in in the world of Harry Potter within The Deathly Hallows Part 1. Something shown very strongly in the film. It's all or nothing from this point on forth. For me, this is the first Harry Potter film that I felt was truly epic. Harry Potter has stepped out of it's comfort zone and is deep in hostile waters, in a Part 1 that ends with a feeling that we will being heading into a very promising Part 2 just months away. One of the year's best and strongest films! (Four out of Four Stars)",

Not only was it by far the least-entertaining, the section of the book this covers was rather poorly written, and them splitting it in two left far too much time for scenes that weren't as good as the second-act scenes of the rest of the series had been. Without the structure of Hogwarts a lot of the scenes felt written for the sole purpose of tying up character arcs -- it would've been illogical to hold a big wedding when there were practically still warm corpses laying about and it didn't make sense for Voldemort not to be in Malfoy Manor or quickly summoned there when they identified Harry's friends. That scene and the finding of Gryffindor's sword felt like deus ex machina in that their way out of the mess was far too convenient and unlikely. Dumbledore obfuscating the clues Harry would use to locate Horcruxes to the point he risks them not being found at all doesn't withstand scrutiny either; obviously he needed to keep the information secure, but he would've thought of a more practical way... in the very first movie he bewitched a mirror so that only a person with good intentions would get the stone by looking at it, for example. Nearly all the character development in this half is dark & they spent a little too much time visually flirting with ruining Ron & Hermione's budding romance. Also, they could've chosen a more cinematic way to interpret the book stranding the trio in the woods multiple times and the film score was unmemorable, though not as poorly done as HP5's. They at least did a good job setting up the finale by getting all of the boring parts out of the way, and I cannot dislike any movie with this much emotional investment, no matter how poorly it pays off in this particular instance.",

They are truly some of the best minutes you'll watch in this entire saga. Now with all of that out of the way, I'm going to say what's on my heart. THE REST OF THE MOVIE IS BORING! Like wtf happened to the pacing? It's like it just gave up. One minute you're riding on the back of a dragon and then the next you're listening to someone talk about someone... talk about someone. This movie had a lot of great things going for it and then waste it as soon as they get out of act 1. And don't even get me started on the whole conflict between Harry, Hermoine and Ron. It feels so useless and unearned. It's literally a conflict for the sake of conflict. It isn't growth for anyone and it's on the boarders of character assassination for Ron. Like when they aren't all acting like assholes, the movie is actually able to move forward. The plot begins to progress and everything feels right again. But damn it if that feeling doesn't take a long time to appear. But yeah, as you can probably tell, that \"conflict\" is my biggest problem with the story. Well, that and pacing, but at least that doesn't make you gag. Other than those two things, the movie actually quite good. It's what I wanted in teh Half-Blood Prince that I didn't get.

Right from the beginning you feel how dark and dangerous the world has become as we get a really intense scene where Harry is being transported to the Weasleys. That sense of dark is great and continues throughout the film as the trio come to understand that they are essentially alone. \n\nThe film has some amazing cinematography. David Yates did an extremely good job of capturing the tone from the books and applying it in this film. Particularly the scene where Harry and Hermione visit the grave of Harry's parents you can feel the emotional impact and it's amazing.\n\nOne of my favourite moments in the entire franchise is the scene where Harry try's to cheer up Hermione. It is a beautiful moment that shows the connection that these two characters have.\n\nIn terms of gripes it's slow, a lot of the film follows them as they search for answers on how to destroy these horcruxs and it isn't paced well. Dobby (Toby Jones) death scene isn't overly emotional to me. I had the same issue when they killed off Sirius, neither character was overly developed so the emotional impact isn't as strong as it could have been. \n\nOverall this film is great, as the darkness and urgency is slowly climbing we can feel that the end is coming soon. \n\n8.5/10",

How can something still seem abrupt when it's been developing for almost ten years? One way, which I consider largely responsible in this case, is to procrastinate about developing the big bad. Voldemort enjoys an appropriately in-depth history in the books, though even there he moves in the shadows and rarely appears in the flesh, but in films he's been almost an afterthought. A victim of the constant trims and clips that have leeched depth from the print editions for years. I always figured they'd get around to him eventually, but now we're in the endgame and named characters are dying and it's quickly become clear that we aren't going to get much more insight than \"no nose / killed parents / generally mean guy.\" Which is odd, considering how much care and effort went into defining and expanding the story's huge, diverse supporting cast.\n\nAnother problem is the whole loom, doom and gloom aspect of this climax, a storm which has been gradually gathering for the last several chapters. Where the first year or two were whimsical and colorful, resonant with talking portraits and leaping chocolates, the mood has turned decidedly gray as Harry's class has aged into young adulthood. A tonal shift is to be expected - after all, isn't everyone a little depressed and melodramatic in their teens - but there's no relief in Deathly Hallows 1. It's a hundred fifty minutes of relentlessly dim, trudging melancholy, completely tired and emotionally flat. Night is always darkest before the dawn and all that, but just a little flash of optimism would go a long way in this regard, especially as the original material's been awkwardly split in two so the credits roll at the base of a steep downward slope. Man, does this movie beat you up.\n\nHarry Potter 7's technical work represents a new high water mark for the series, delivering all sorts of crazy, large-scale, wand-based battle scenes and grim, haunting locales, so it's got that going for it. The acting is generally strong, too, with Ralph Fiennes stealing the limelight as the effectively slimy, paranoid antagonist. There's just no getting past the crushing, invasive dullness of it all, nor the odd transposition of a few light-hearted themes and characters into that deep, dark new atmosphere. One scene, in particular, is like watching Jar Jar Binks get the tear-jerking \"Bubba in Forrest Gump\" farewell treatment.

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, directed by David Yates, was a highly anticipated film, with some great moments, but David Yates seemed to have missed on the potential this film had, making it feel somewhat underwhelming. The way the film was structured was pretty messy, because they felt the need to split this into two films. Most events felt underdeveloped and unfinished, having no real pay off, because they needed to fit so much into this film, for Part 2 to work the way they wanted it to. Part 1 can only stand on it's own, due to the tie ins from the previous films, because it took all of the set up hits, to create just an action-packed finale. When Yates went off the source material, that's where the film takes it's dips. The stuff he throws in, just feels like unnecessary filler, because it has no real meaning to what's going on. Other than that, David Yates managed to stay fairly true to the source material, creating a nice mystery, with great stakes, and a really intriguing adventure. The pacing of the film as fine at first, then became more of a slowburn film, and it threw off the excitement this film had to offer. The tone Yates set was probably one of the darkest, and unsettling yet, almost having a slight horror vibe.\n\nIf you love all of the characters of Harry Potter, you're going to have a good time with this film! David Yates incorporates a decent amount of team chemistry, but really focuses on individual motives, and it helped drive the film. The villains are now a huge presence in the films, and they're all utilized in a great way, keeping the tention and stakes high at all times. The only issues I had with some of the main characters, there were some forced conflicts and drama, that dragged on for too long, while having some inconsistencies with some of the motives.\n\nThe magic and action of the film was so much fun! There were countless enjoyable sequences, where you can feel that the teams, both, behind, and in front of the camera, are feeling extremely comfortable with their abilities to perform.\n\nOverall, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, has their fair share of issues, but there was just enough enjoyable moments to keep this film afloat.\n\n*stand alone rating- 6/10*",

            "content": "This is the most underrated film in the series in my opinion, I greatly enjoy this film each time I see it and I know that is an unpopular opinion. This film has a different tone than the rest of the series and taking our three main leads on a quest by themselves outside of Hogwarts is a very refreshing change of location and gives us time to develop these characters as much as possible before the impending war. Daniel Radcliffe has improved once again and I cared for his character emotionally, but Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are both on a higher plane of acting talent because they give great performances and really give a lot of time to strengthen the relationships that these characters share with one another. I love that this last book was split into two parts, there is so much stuff that happens and this decision allows for the finale to not be rushed but rather take its time where it needs to set up this epic finale, and that's a complaint I hear a lot, that this movie is just a big set up for the real year seven in the next film, but I think that these two films work together very well as companion pieces to the same book. This first part allows us to dive right into the minds of our main characters and feel what their feeling emotionally inside and it is a good character study. The action sequences were done very well, David Yates really stepped up his game and the direction he gives this film is excellent, the tone, the colors, and music all make you feel very somber and dreary because Voldemort is taking over everywhere and it becomes a very dark time to live in and you genuinely feel that as you watch this film. The entire first act is pretty fast-paced with the seven Harrys, Bill's wedding, and the cafe fight, but my favorite part of this film is when they infiltrate the Ministry of Magic and we see Umbridge again, it was very exciting and Ron got into character way too much which is awesome to see. After they get the locket though, the next second act and the first half of the third act slows down considerably and we get that great emotional bonding with our three leads, I know many people say that the locket was a copy of Lord of the Rings, it doesn't feel like a ripoff to me but more of an homage, it worked well in this world and led to some great intense sequences of great dialogue between our characters. I enjoyed seeing Godrics Hollow and learning more about not just Harry but Dumbledores life as well, which is another praise I have for this story, Harry and his friends are all on their own, every other movie had Dumbledore telling him everything he needed to do and helped him do it, but we get to see the maturity and intellect of Harry put to the test as we journey with him to find all of the Horcruxes. I loved how they showed us the story of the three brothers, the art style was great and the story was riveting and it helped show us how dangerous the Hallows really are. The ending picks up the pace as we go to Malfoy Manor and have a small fight in which Dobby dies and I must say, I was emotionally affected by his death more than Dumbledores and Sirius' deaths, I cried so much because he was cute and very likable and his death was done right. All in All, this is one of my favorite Harry Potter films with some great direction, great emotional explorations of our characters, it is warranted the two parts because they make a lot of progress and it doesn't feel like set-up, David Yates direction was good, the CGI was used sparingly, it has fun fast-paced sequences as well as the thoughtful slow-paced ones, and Dobby's death was a great way to end this movie. I really think that this film is underrated and should be higher on many people's lists because this was part one of a finale done right.",

Instead of combining Part 1 & 2 for a larger finale, it was decided to squeeze the series for a bit more cash.\n\nThe end result of the above process is a film with a few interesting parts and a ton of filler. There's a lot of drag in this one that could have been cut out.\n\nOf course, as usual with Potterverse films, there's action, comedy, etc. But this film awkwardly transitions from months at a time to days. The pacing is all off and a mess.\n\n.5/5. Removed extra for the unnecessary filler and the fact that this wasn't combined with Part 2 for a single film. Though, I did love Dobby.",

            "content": "A dull walk through the forest.\n\nDavid Yates had the unenviable task of adapting J.W. Rowling's worst novel yet with his dreary and dull dark fantasy adventure film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part I (2010) as it's so derivative of other fantasy works that it's embarrassing. Yates' direction is uninspired and bland for a movie building up to a finale. It certainly feels like this movie is all filler to just set up for the last film and that's it. All the pale running through the woods that drags down the middle of this movie feels right out of Twilight. Eduardo Serra's shaky cinematography is ugly and washed out for a hideous feel throughout whether it's a goofy wide shot or an awkward close-up shot. Stuart Craig's production design has neat Gothic choices for Malfoy's mansion, but ugly plain ideas for the tents and forest backdrops.\n\nIt's a confusing and boring mess. Whether characters are randomly being introduced and forgotten or people just mope out in the wilderness, this feels less like a magical Harry Potter adventure, and more like a horrid camping trip you're being forced to go on just to get somewhere better later. I don't know how anyone enjoyed this one as it's easily the worst Harry Potter movie.\n\nDreadfully slow pace with few magical moments as the viewer is treated to Yates' creative direction for a single animated story about The Deathly Hallows, meanwhile the rest of the film is dreary and bleak for the sake of appearing mature. It's just depressing for 146 minutes. It feels the length for sure. Mark Day's editing is nowhere to be seen as every scene drags on too long for a mind numbing pace with too few cuts for once. Little is explained as Day opts to just give us the basics of the story in a strangely edited fashion. Jany Temime's costumes have cool contemporary outfits for Hermione, but the rest look rather ordinary for a movie about wizards.\n\nFurthermore, Alexandre Desplat's score has a few inspired moments, but is so rarely present as the majority of scenes pass by with mostly ambient noise and a bit of dialogue. I can barely remember his music for this one. Normally, Desplat's scores are enchanting and magical, but never less so for this wizard picture's score, sadly. A more resounding score could have helped the pace and feel of The Deathly Hallows - Part I.\n\nI think J. K. Rowling's writing got too dark for her own good. Killing off characters left and right to appear more mature and serious is an obvious attempt at matching her growing audience's desire for dark stories. I think people could have used some magic and warmth instead as this feels less like Harry Potter and more like Twilight or The Hunger Games with tedious love triangles and Steve Kloves' awkward dialogue. \n\nI must say the greatest weakness of this film is the reliance on Ron's jealousy of Harry thinking he likes Hermione here. It's such a strange choice as we just spent the entire last film showing that Harry loves Ginny and Ron knows that. Rowling just forgot her own characters as Ron is more unlikable and mean than ever. Hermione deserves better and gets some sweet moments with Harry like them dancing to comfort one another in these dark times. So alongside Yates' weakest direction is Rowling's misguided concepts and Steve Kloves' awkward script.\n\nIn all, I never liked this Harry Potter film and it still doesn't hold up well despite a few nice moments.",

Yes this is just them setting up part.2 as this is more on the story than anything else, and I really enjoy it. This is a well made film.... easily the best part of this film was the 3 brothers story, the way it was animated along with Emma Watson calmly storytelling voice narration really brought something fresh to the HP franchise. I love Emma's and Daniel's chemistry throughout this film as its mainly focus on them for majority of the film, the dance scene really showed how their friendship has changed since the beginning. I think what people might complain with this movie is that the fact the lighting is keeps getting darker each film, but it helps to set up the tone for this film which pays of in my opinion. Their is some cool action scenes, like the 7 Harry escape, big fan of that especially. However, there are times where the story just slows down and it doesn't pick up the pace for quite a while..... oh and did they have to (SPOILER) break our hearts with Dobby's death???? I know this was in the book, but the way it was transferred to the screen is even more sad to see.... Here lies a free elf......\nBring on Part.2!",

            "content": "The last book in the Harry Potter saga has been split into two parts. At first, maybe people would think it is to squeeze some more financial mileage out of the series. On the other hand, having watched this installment, there is simply too much complex storytelling involved in this book to cram it into only one two and half hour movie.\n\nThis Part 1 is already a very full two and half hours. The drama begins even before the opening credits roll. The special effects have reached a new high point with the trick of using polyjuice potion to create multiple Harry's. The frenetic escape of Harry in Hagrid's motor sidecar is an achievement in action editing. The trio's penetration of the Ministry of Magic to get the locket horcrux is very exciting and tension-filled.\n\nMomentum dips a bit in the midsection as our trio scour the English wilderness for a way to destroy the horcrux. This prolonged section, which some may find boring, dealt more with the personal relationships loyalty of the three friends as challenges are thrown their way. The segment is marked by the hard-to-watch bloodlust of Bellatrix Lestrange and the nobility of Dobby. Watch out too for a most unexpected dance scene which will surely make you smile, if not actually chuckle!\n\nIn the third section, we learn what the \"deathly hallows\" are referred to in the title as our trio learns it from Xenophilius Lovegood. But the main highlight here is a most amazing animated short featurette called \"The Tale of Three Brothers\" as narrated by Hermione. This Part 1 ends very well with a sky-splitting final cliffhanger sequence.\n\nIts been repeatedly mentioned how the main actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have all grown up in front of our eyes as this movie series unfolded. Rupert and Emma are both taller than Daniel already! Acting-wise, everyone had likewise improved very much. They all even show some skin here. Yes, even Hermione! The support from the esteemed gallery of British actors and actresses serve the film very well indeed. We saw everyone from all the previous films it seems, except for Maggie Smith.\n\nThe direction of David Yates is excellent as he did in the last two films. Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves got just the proper mix of action, drama and humor needed to make the saga work on screen. This may just be a set-up installment, however, it stands very strong on its own merits. As the last scene faded to black, the audience will definitely develop the resolve to watch out for the concluding part to be released next summer, and witness the epic Battle of Hogwarts.A sullen Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) sets the mood for this seventh and penultimate instalment of Harry Potter. \"These are dark times, there's no denying,\" he intones gravely, pointing out the grim state of affairs facing the nation- murders, disappearances and raids- but reassuring the public, as any politician would, that his Ministry has it all under control. Of course, he is only bluffing, and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise. \n\nWelcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter, one that began with wonder and joy, but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore, Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore- to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes (accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul). It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. \n\nThere are fewer and fewer allies around- even those within the Order of the Phoenix may have since betrayed their ranks- and the first half hour quickly establishes the danger and urgency of the situation at hand. Members of the Order, including Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), attempt to escort Harry to safety- but even that mission is met with an attack from the Death Eaters, culminating in a dizzyingly exciting high-speed flying-bike chase that shouldn't disappoint fans looking for some action sorely missed in the last movie. \n\nIndeed, naysayers who think David Yates doesn't know how to stage thrilling action sequences should think again, as he demonstrates amply that he is just as capable when it comes to staging them. He also displays an uncanny knack for milking suspense out of scenes- in particular, Harry, Hermoine and Ron's daring raid on the Ministry of Magic and their subsequent visit to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and home to Bathilda Bagshot, a magician and dear friend to Dumbledore. These brim with nail-biting tension, and Yates plays them out nicely to set your pulse racing at the end. \n\nThe crux of this film however lies in the relationships between Harry, Hermoine and Ron as they set off in the middle of the film across the bleak English countryside on their quest to discover the means to destroy the Horcruxes. On the run from Voldemort, the trio find the immensity of their journey taking a toll on them. Harry and Ron's friendship begins to fray as Ron grows suspect of Hermoine's affections for Harry. Meanwhile, Harry can barely conceal his frustration with getting no headway and starts losing his temper at Ron. \n\nInfused with a profound sense of isolation and loss, this middle stretch in the film may be tedious for some impatient viewers, but fans will be rewarded with probably the richest depiction of the relationships between the characters since the first two movies. One scene where Harry and Hermoine suddenly decide to dance together to the tune of Nick Cave's The Children playing on the radio is lyrical in its depiction of their desperate attempt to find levity in a world that affords none. Yes, their friendship strong and deep since the beginning will be tested, and Yates delivers an emotional payoff towards the end of the film that is truly poignant. \n\nThanks to the decision to split the final book into two films, Yates doesn't hurry through these scenes. Instead, he allows the audience to experience the frustration, jealousy and uncertainty of his characters, and allows for Radcliffe, Watson and Grint to display some fine acting with the minimalest distraction from any visual effects. The additional time also turns out to be a blessing for fans and audiences, allowing them the opportunity to see their favourite supporting characters back on screen- most prominently of course Dobby the elf who returns to give the movie a touching finale. \n\nAmidst the gloom, screenwriter Steve Kloves again provides for rare welcome moments of levity. Harry's escort mission is aided by magical decoys of Harry, one of them wearing a bra. To get to the Ministry of Magic, one needs to flush oneself down a toilet bowl. These occasional sparks of humour enliven a film that is otherwise ominous and menacing. Kloves however fumbles slightly with the lengthy expository, and those who have not read the book will find themselves struggling to catch up with the significance of certain characters (e.g. Sirius' brother, Regulus Arcturus Black) and certain events (e.g. Bathilda turning into a slithering serpent). \n\nStill Kloves never had an enviable task to begin with, and Yates- at his most confident here- guides the proceedings along admirably, unfolding them briskly at the start, then settling in for a deliberately measured pace and finally picking up speed for as much as a climax as this first- parter can have. His assuredness also shows in his artistic choices, especially a wayang-kulit-like animated sequence telling the story of the Deathly Hallows. \n\nThough we know better than to expect the grand showdown between Harry and Voldemort by the end of the film, there is still a distinct sense that what we have seen so far is only a build-up for something bigger and far more astounding. But even as a prelude, this seventh film is notable in its own right, a tense and thrilling experience darker, scarier and more mature than any of its predecessors.\"Deathly Hallows Part 1\" follows the book closely, but misses out on a few interesting scenes, and then makes up a few additional scenes that are poignant and incredibly welcome. \n\nIn the beginning, it seems like the film's skipping through the book's content very quickly, but it makes sense, when you realise how much is going on. At the end, the beginning is far away, although the journey there doesn't make it seem like a long while. \n\nGeneral opinion seems to be that it drags in the middle, but, let's face it, so did the book. There's no real reason to complain about Endless Camping Trips at all, because the film moves from plot point to set piece to plot point all the time. There's some clever ways the film handles its exposition, although it is not without its faults. \n\nThe trio's acting is the second best thing in this film. Emma has improved loads over the past few years, and she seems to be at the top of her game in this film. Her acting is stellar. As usual, Grint gets saddled with the role of comic relief, but he also gets his chance to shine in an array of emotional scenes. Daniel manages to carry the story as the main character. The three manage to stand their own very well without the presence of the adult actors.\n\nSpeaking of adult actors, Nick Morran's Scabior is a delightful character - he's slightly perverted and he has a bit of a Jack Sparrow vibe going on. Peter Mullan's Yaxley was impressive and managed to be quite threatening. It is a shame that we see so little of Bill Nighy's character, the new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour. The character was regrettably cut from the previous film, and I wish they hadn't, if only to see more of Nighy's impressive performance. Old-time familiar faces are great, as usual. Fiona Shaw gets but one shot of screen time, but the look in her eyes says so much about her character. Jasoon Isaacs is terrific as a broken and devastated Lucius Malfoy. The lack of Rickman is a shame, but the presence of Bonham Carter makes up for it. Big baddie Ralph Fiennes manages to finally be a menacing, scary Voldemort in the film's first scenes, but as the story progresses and he gets appearances in a few messy, rushed and disappointing visions, Voldemort's actions just don't continue being an ominous cloud of danger, as they should be. \n\nThe film's greatest achievement, however, is the animated sequence detailing the \"Tale of the Three Brothers\", an interesting wizard fairytale. It is a daring move from the filmmakers, one that will pleasantly surprise the audience.\n\nThe biggest letdown is how the film doesn't just keep going. After two-and-a-half hours, it doesn't feel like the story's finished. A few scenes were added to make the climax more exciting, but it's just a downright shame that the movie doesn't just continue for another hour or two.",

            "content": "A deathly emotional and beautifully shot film that has the potentially to bring you to tears on multiple occasions, even if it might feel like a setup at times rather than its own film. \n\nThe first installment of the two-film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows follows Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) as they search for the pieces of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul that he extracted from his being and hid in obscure locations both far and wide. If the trio is unable to locate and destroy them all, Voldemort will remain immortal. Despite their long friendship, a combination of dark forces, romantic tensions, and long-held secrets threaten to sabotage the mission. \n\nAll great things must come to an end, even if it takes two parts to do so. The seventh film and the first of two parts is not only extremely emotional, but it's the start of what feels like an end to an era. Everything we've been waiting for escalates up to this moment, and you can't help but let your emotions run loose as you see all of our beloved characters. \n\nI guess the only real problem I had with this film is that it feels like a setup sometimes to the grand finale. Some moments and ideas are stretched out a little too long in order to meet a longer run-time but more often than not, it feels kind of useless in a sense. Either way, I still think this film is really well done and although this is a problem, it's not enough to dismay what I felt when watching this movie. \n\nSo far, this has been one of the more emotional films, with much more destruction and crying to come. We see all the characters we know and love come together one last time as they all fight for their lives. We see the sacrifices they all make, the choices they live by, and what they all stand for. It's extremely emotional when you put yourself in this situation, especially when they give you a beginning as they did here. I was on the brink of tears as I saw all the darkness this movie had to offer, which is a magnificent example as to how well these films have done in immersing you in this world.  \n\nI think we really see our main actors shine here. They've all had their moments of glory in the previous films, but I feel like they all give pretty powerful performances here. Everyone from Daniel Radcliffe and down the list, they all offer something great here. Maybe it's the fact of how long everyone's been a part of these films, but they all embrace their characters very well.\n\nSo far out of the first seven films, I think this is the best looking film by far. It's beautifully shot and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. I love the look of this film and everything from the set pieces to where they actually shot the movie is stunning. It's easily the best looking film so far, discounting whatever we'll see from the next film. I really appreciate just how different this film feels based on the settings alone, making it a special one in its own right. \n\nIn the end, this film is extremely dark and magical, signaling the end of a franchise (or, a near end in this case). It's an excellent build up, with some problems for sure, but I can't help how much emotion I feel seeing everything fall together.",

It's true that this film often feels like it's spinning its wheels, with long stretches of downtime, the characters sitting around planning their next move or arguing. What saves it from complete mundanity is its character moments. Each of the 3 principal cast members get a chance to demonstrate their acting chops and reveal the depths of their performances. Some of their conflicts may feel predictable and easy to resolve, but enough of them feel human that the ones which don't aren't too much of an annoyance. It serves its purpose in getting us to the final movie, and is probably the least rewatchable of the series, but for a single viewing it's still a decent flick.",

            "content": "There have been quite a few times, especially recently, when dividing the last story of a franchise into two parts was a huge mistake.  But then there is the Harry Potter series, which managed to make a well-strung first part, which ranks among the franchise's best, to set up one of the greatest conclusions in film history.\n\nUpon first viewing, I wasn't a huge fan of the first Deathly Hallows.  To me, it was missing its own identity and conclusion to feel like its own film.  Of course, this was before having seen part 2.  Now that I have gone back and re-watched each film, I have grown more of an appreciation for the series as a whole, and particularly, Deathly Hallows Part 1.  There are certainly still some minute problems that can be annoying, like Voldemort's minimal presence, but this was the first movie that solely focused on the trio of Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  That was a welcomed shift for me.\n\nAfter the last 3 films, it seemed like the series had already grown up enough.  But I like the fact that this film wasn't just them cutting ties with their family and loved ones to find horcruxes, it was about them becoming adults capable of doing things on their own.  So in many ways, this is a film about unity and independence at the same time.  I love watching the trio have to go on the road and figure out all of the horcruxes without the help of their parents or Dumbledore.  It makes the payoff in the 8th movie all the more gratifying.\n\nThis may be a stretch, but this film feels a lot like a Western set in the Potterverse.  In fact, there are a lot of the same characteristics as a revenge or fantasy-western.  On the run, looking for something significant, and constantly fighting off the looming presence of a bigger evil.  To me, that's a fantasy western.  \n\nNo matter, the film has its fair share of thrilling sequences of action along with some needed heartfelt moments between the trio.  The relationship particularly between Harry and Hermione has never been a focus, in fact rarely touched upon, until this film.  Even though there's nothing romantic at all, it became one of the series' most endearing bonds.  Of course, Ron didn't seem to think so, as he got jealous in the most clich\u00e9d way possible.  But again, Harry and Ron needed that conflict to make the payoff of Ron coming back to save Harry and destroying a Horcrux all the more satisfying.\n\nPlenty of other noteworthy sequences include a brilliantly thoughtful Tale of the 3 Brothers story told by Hermione, Dobby's return, Umbridge's unsettling return, and even the opening escape sequence.  I know it isn't beloved by the fandom like the others, but I believe Deathly Hallows is a necessary deviation from the typical trip to the Potterverse so that part 2 is as epic as we know it is.  Love this film.\n\n+The trio. The whole time\n\n+Returns of beloved characters\n\n+Maturation process for the trio\n\n+Search for the Horcruxes\n\n+So many reveals and set ups\n\n9.3/10",

There is so much build-up to the final conclusion still to come that the ending of Part 1 almost feels like a \"let-down.\" However, what this film does get right is the despair, loneliness, and sheer frustration that Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through as they attempt to hunt down and destroy the evil Lord Voldemort's horcruxes.

I understand that is kind of the point of splitting a movie into two, however if a 2 hour and 26 minute film cannot be watched and be fully understood without watching its continuation, it can never be close to being a perfect film on its own.

As we draw ever closer to the boy wizards final curtain call, Harry faces old enemies, new obstacles and personal revelations in his quest to put an end to the greatest war in wizarding history.\n\nLeft largely to their own devices both in physical location and acting abilities, the unforgivingly grim beginning-of-the-end odyssey has a vastly contrasting style from its predecessors. \n\nEvading capture, fugitives Harry, Ron and Hermione (Daniel Ratcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson) embark on a secret and perilous mission based on inscrutable clues left by their deceased headmaster Dumbledore's; to find and destroy the Dark Lord Voldemort's well disguised and highly protected secret keys to eternal life, the seven Horcruxes. \nWith no idea what they are, how to find them or how to dismantle them once obtained, Harry and comrades are at odds with the situation and each other.\n\nAdding to the tension, Lord Voldemort's most avid followers, the Death Eaters have seized complete control of the Ministry of Magic, and the wizarding world at large. Terrorising and imprisoning muggle borns, mudbloods and Potter sympathisers, the Death Eaters place a bounty on Harry's head; Undesirable #1, wanted alive. \n\nAs the task becomes overwhelming, all hope the trio hold for victory slowly begins to diminish and hopelessness seeps in. But as the search continues, they uncover a saviour in a long discredited children's tale that may offer a chance, the Deathly Hallows.\n\nEven Harry's direct link to Voldermort's most intimate desires defies understanding and logic. Can they find the horcruxes? Can they stay undetected? Can they uncover Lord Voldemort's plan? Can they figure out what the deathly hallows story means and if it is relevant? And most importantly, Can they stay alive?\n\nOriginally marketed as being presented in 3D, producers have now pulled the idea as it will not do \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows story justice\". As the nine year, seven picture marathon nudges ever closer to 20 hours, splitting the very long seventh instalment into two and partially simplifying the entanglements of the story, viewers happily get the best account of the longest book.\n\nAs is the movie too want, streamlining of the high and low points is the only way to do it justice. The abundance of visual magic, maturing of characters, development of story sophistication and the wonderfully high calibre acting culminate in its ominous and expectant tone building to a completely encompassing ambiance. \n\nSome scenes clearly stand out as beautifully adapted from the book and artful additions to the movie. Harry trying to lighten the tension offering his hand to dance with Hermione, the shadow puppet rendition of the Tale of the Three Brothers story, the candid replicating Harry sevenfold, the house elf scuffle, and Hermione's 'confudousing' of her muggle parents.\n\nOn the other side, the lack of specific location and central focus (previously filled by the safe back drop of Hogwarts school, but now resting on one characters shoulder, although well done on her acting part) leaves viewers a little ungrounded. \n\nThe constant introduction of new unexplored characters and old minimally screened characters is hard to piece who or why they are there, and the frantic blur of movement they add distracts from the spliced story arc. \n\nWith some slightly ambiguous and almost inappropriate directorial missteps; including a disconcertingly over affectionate montage and the ruff removal of some basic plot points, it is clear things could have been handled gentler and simpler. \n\nThe Verdict: A most poignant quote \"I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic.\" Harry potter and his supernatural story begins to draw to a end with style and chivalry. \n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 19/11/2010",

A group of rebellion takes the chance to help Potter through all of this. In order to defeat Voldemort. They need to destroy the 5 Horcruxes that can trigger Voldemort's weaknesses. And this film is what is all about. I thought, maybe it disappoints anyone as storytelling goes. But the quality of the film is still top notch. The pacing jumps from high to low. I love the part where Potter and Hagrid, riding this old school WWII type bicycle, as they where chased by Dementors while exchanging wand powers. I understand, there are some parts that were really unnecessary where like, this film is getting dramatic in an awkward way. I see Potter and Hermoine dancing together while Ron is away or somewhat his jealous about it. Yet it is pretty understandable, more like the impact of the Horcrux is showing. The second half gets me more interested. As It also introduced the story behind the Deathly Hollows. The Invisibility cloak, the Elder wand and the Resurrection stone. And I did like how it was presented in a way of animation. Everything in this film is still engaging as ever. The beautiful landscapes are fantastic, it is visually stunning at some point. Besides of a weaker plot, David Yates and his dark themed fantasy is still as breathtaking as ever. Visually impressive, well acted performances and it is dark as hell. I thought this is the darkest and the creepiest Harry Potter yet. Overall a great watch. 4/5",

Overall, however, the film drags on as the story throws seemingly random plot devices at the viewer, threatening to confuse and befuddle rather than intrigue.

Lord Voldemort has been ruling, together with his minions and the 12 Death Eaters. And he wants to eliminate Potter himself. Despite of the  Dumbledor incident. A group of rebellion takes the chance to help Potter through all of this. In order to defeat Voldemort. They need to destroy the 5 Horcruxes that can trigger Voldemort's weaknesses. And this film is what  is all about. I thought, maybe it disappoints anyone as storytelling goes. But the quality of the film is still top notch. The pacing jumps from high to low. I love the part where Potter and Hagrid, riding this old school WWII type bicycle, as they where chased by Dementors while exchanging wand powers.  I understand, there are some parts that were really unnecessary where like, this film is getting dramatic in an awkward way. I see Potter and Hermoine dancing together  while Ron is away or somewhat his jealous about it. Yet it is pretty understandable, more like the impact of the Horcrux is showing. The second half gets me more interested. As It also introduced the story behind the Deathly Hollows. The Invisibility cloak, the  Elder wand and the Resurrection stone. And I did like how it was presented in a way of animation.  Everything in this film is still engaging as ever. The beautiful landscapes are fantastic, it is visually stunning at some point. Besides of a weaker plot, David Yates and his dark themed fantasy is still as breathtaking as ever. Visually impressive, well acted performances and it is dark as hell. I thought this is the darkest and the creepiest Harry Potter yet. Overall a great watch. 4/5",

When Twilight done it, it doesn't make sense, and when The Hunger Games done it, it makes even less sense, and I'm a fan of the Hunger Games. So with this, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 may feel like the prelude to Part 2, but it still holds out on its own. The camerawork is really good, and the soundtrack by Alexander Desplat is good also. The movie mostly rest on the the three main leads, and they are great as usual. The movie is definitely the most serious out of all the Harry Potter films which was argued that it took some of the magic away. Also the middle was really slow which some people would get bored at, but I wasn't bored at all. It still has some funny moments, but not as many though which was a bit disappointing. The effects gets more and more impressive from every Harry Potter film to the next, and there's some really good chase scenes that got me excited. There was some convenient moments that just came out of nowhere, and the Snatchers were underused and I didn't really know much about them. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 isn't going to be anyone's favorite Harry Potter movie and quite frankly, I think it's the least best, but it's still a nice addition to the series.",

            "content": "It's very easy to hold a grudge against Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows purely on the grounds of the industrial precedent it created. The financial success of splitting the last and biggest of the books into two instalments led to the same tactic being employed with Twilight and The Hunger Games, regardless of whether their respective source materials actually merited such an approach. For fans and casual viewers alike, the move smacked of wanting to milk as much as possible out of the last drops of a given franchise.\n\nIn the case of HP7a (as Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo christened it), we find the franchise finally starting to cut to the chase, beginning the build-up towards the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. Having drawn things out for so long, putting off this inevitable showdown, there is almost a rush to get in everything that is left to be said. Under these circumstances, splitting the book into two films is almost the most logical thing to do, and while not all of it works, it does have a lot of attractive qualities.\n\nThe feeling that a lot is being crammed into this final act brings us back to our ongoing comparison with The Lord of the Rings. Many film fans had quibbles with the ending(s) of The Return of the King, and fans of the book were in two minds about some of the omissions, particularly the scourging of the Shire and the death of Saruman (in the theatrical cut). But even taking those as gospel truth - for the moment - Peter Jackson did quite an excellent job of balancing and converging all the different aspects of Middle Earth in the climatic battles - a much better job, in fact, than he managed recently on the third and final Hobbit film.\n\nBy contrast, Deathly Hallows - Part 1 has a lot of plot for us to swallow, making it simultanously one of the most satisfying and one of the most impenetrable instalments in the series. If you spent the previous two films crying out for a plot which directly focussed on the  return of Voldemort and what his victory could mean for the wider world, you will find yourself openly rejoicing at the fact that this is finally being addressed. Equally, the series is so far gone and insular by this point, that if you happen to find yourself watching this by accident on late-night TV, chances are that you won't have the faintest idea what is going on.\n\nThe film is helped somewhat in this regard by the horcruxes, a plot device which I covered in detail in my previous Harry Potter review. All of my criticisms of this McGuffin aside, the hunt for the horcruxes gives the film structure and a definite end-point towards which we are heading. Like The Two Towers, Deathly Hallows - Part 1 ends before said end-point has been reached, but like Jackson's film there is (to some extent) a feeling of catharsis and expectation of what is to come. That being said, the death of Dobby, like Dumbledore's in the previous film, still feels like an arbitrary event, included purely because it happened in the book. For all his dramatic credentials, David Yates still hasn't grasped how to build up tension so that a death can carry meaning: it's not so much a 'shock death' as a nothing-death.\n\nBy focussing on the search for the horcruxes, and taking the action away from Hogwarts, Deathly Hallows - Part 1 moves the series into more candidly existential territory. Our three main characters are at their most isolated and strained since Goblet of Fire, faced with a quest which is seemingly impossible, and having to cope without either the wisdom or protection of their teachers. Kermode's comparisons with Ingmar Bergman may seem far-fetched at first glance, but there is a point behind them: there are fewer creature comforts here than in previous efforts, and like Bergman's films there is little credence given to sentimentality.\n\nThe aesthetic of Deathly Hallows - Part 1 reflects this desire for all the stability and comfort in Harry's world to be diminished. Eduardo Serra, who won a BAFTA for his work on Wings of a Dove, shoots the action in a more pathos-ridden manner, emphasising the stillness of the woods, the intimidating dark colours and the increasingly pallid landscapes. Yates employs more hand-held work for the chase sequences through the woods, but is also judicious in his choice of wide shots to reinforce the smallness of the characters. There are times in Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack when the world around the characters seems to creak and wail, akin to Alan Splet's extraordinary work on David Lynch's Eraserhead.\n\nTwo sequences in the film reinforce the feeling of gathering gloom and descending darkness better than any other. The first is the animated rendering of the Tale of the Three Brothers, whose stick-like characterisations are somewhere between Classical depictions of soldiers and the caricatures of Gerald Scarfe. The animation on its own is beautifully designed and well-told, but the sequence gives the eponymous hallows more status than they would have had if introduced through just another swathe of exposition. The tale has a Chaucerian quality to it, with Death's characterisation being as subtle and cunning as his namesake in 'The Pardoner's Tale' within The Canterbury Tales.\n\nThe second, equally potent sequence is the trio's infiltration of the Ministry of Magic. I mentioned in my review of Order of the Phoenix about the Ministry's design being rooted in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. What was then a mere inflection is now made flesh, with Yates borrowing heavily yet grippingly from the Michael Radford adaptation, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton. The low-angle shots of the banners and wanted posters, not to mention the robotic movements of the Ministry's employees, reinforce the feeling of freedom and justice being crushed in the name of purity and homogeny. Imelda Staunton's return as Dolores Umbridge only hammers this home, taking her inevitable place as the puppet of a state governed by fear, and projecting her own self-loathing onto those she deems inferior.\n\nIn the end, however, the centrepiece of Deathly Hallows - Part 1 is the relationship between our central trio, something which is anchored us throughout the ups and downs of the entire series. Like Goblet of Fire, seeing the central three at each others' throats is completely believable, but now that the stakes are raised their every tiff or raised voice could spell disaster. Rupert Grint does especially well in conveying the frustration of his character, whether it's listening to the radio to see whether his family has been killed, or his reaction to the nightmarish visions which burst forth from the locket.\n\nThe only problem with the approach that Yates adopts is that the character-driven scenes begin to feel repetitive very quickly. It's not quite the case that you could show these sequences in any order you please, but the fact that Ron comes back so relatively quickly negates a lot of the emotional impact of his departure. Equally, there's little to suggest that the order in which the horcruxes are destroyed is the only order in which they could have been tackled; in this film at least, there's no progression from one to the other in terms of their potency or difficulty.\n\nAnother big problem with which the film is lumbered is the need to tie up a lot of the supporting storylines, often by simply killing people off. Rowling described the action of the final book as a war, and in war unpredictable deaths are to be expected. But that doesn't mean that characters and creatures to which we have dedicated several years of our lives can just be swept aside as collatoral damage. If you thought that Ginny and Harry's kiss in Half-Blood Prince came out of nowhere, a lot of Deathly Hallows - Part 1 will feel completely jarring and inert. Once again, Yates can't deliver the knock-out blow when it matters most, working so hard on a general tone that the particular moments carry no weight.\n\nIt's not just the death of Dobby which falls into this category; the entire Battle of the Seven Potters is a classic example of this approach. The special effects needed to create seven Daniel Radcliffes are all well and good, but the battle's choreography is choppy and disorientating; it doesn't communicate the chaos of the battle, it just leaves you wondering why they bothered in the first place. The deaths of multiple characters are treated in a lackadaisical, matter-of-fact manner, whether we see them on screen (Hedwig) or are simply told about them (Mad-Eye Moody). To top it off, Voldemort's appearance in the scene is a complete waste of time: he doesn't come across as threatening, he does nothing of significance, and he's so easily defeated.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 is an intriguing, atmospheric and bleak offering which serves up a lot of good points in amongst its all-too-common drawbacks. It is perhaps the strongest of the Harry Potter films since Goblet of Fire, and unlike many of the films in the series it may well improve with repeat viewings. But while its visuals and main characters are impressive, it's ultimately hobbled or reined in by meaningless deaths and dull repetition. For fans, it's an impressive and ambitious sequel; for cynics, it's a reassurance that, very soon, this will all be over.",

The part 1 and part 2 of 'Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows' could've been one movie for sure! That being said of course the studio wants to take a quick way out and be in the money for these two unnecessary parts to this epic conclusion of the serious! Now the acting is top notch and I love to see how these actors in the series grew better and better by each film. The directing is great by steady camera shots of CGI or practical effects. Sceneries are magnificent when it comes to this film. The darkness and eeriness to the mood builds up enjoyment and unexpected realism. Yeah the drama is a little too soap opera to me and forced. The elements to magic and wizardry is underused. We as the audience are getting nothing but worthless dialogue of mediocre drama. I know the script writer wants to build more character into these characters but c'mon we get the point already! There is barely any action in it which is not a horrible thing. But in my mind this bothers me that this movie has potential to get me on the edge of my seat for part 2 and it didn't in reality. In my opinion this is a cash grab but disguised as a decent film overall. Moving on, this is a underachieved a Harry Potter film. I will probably not watch this film again. I mean I enjoyed it, it's just that it is a huge let down. The beginning of this movie. The first 45 minutes right.. perfect! I loved the beginning of the film with Harry growing up and wing in danger. Fighting back against the de mentors. I love that aspect of it. Now ok when it's making it's way to the middle and end I was like meh... Boring but has it's shinning moments here and there and is an appreciated movie itself. And also by the way not shunned by the Harry Potter fans. So Props! Overall, I will give 'Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1' a C+.",

Watson still performed her role well, so did Radcliffe. It certainly would be a good film for the die hard fans, but as a critic, it could have been better.",

But believe me - we get a Potter movie like you've never seen.\n\nMost of the visual magic takes place in the first act, as we're treated to a batch of Polyjuice Potion, a Wizard wedding and a rather spectacular chase sequence on a flying motorbike. But for the main chunk of the film, Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 is a character study, plain and simple. Supported by beautiful landscapes and top-notch cinematography, the film focusses almost exclusively on our three heroes as they travel far and wide in their search for an answer to what is turning into a full-scale war.\n\nDeathly Hallows goes to places not previously explored, particularly given the franchise's lighter beginnings under the guidance of Chris Columbus, as we now tackle heavy issues of racism, ethnic cleansing, slavery and Rowling's magical interpretation of Nazism. The style and atmosphere is reminiscent of post-apocalyptic fiction and cosy-catastrophe concepts worthy of H.G. Wells or John Wyndham. The icing on the cake would be Ben Hibon's superbly animated \"Tale of the Three Brothers\", one of the finest sequences in the entire franchise. As if that weren't enough, we also get perfectly timed blends of horror, romance and, finally, tragedy.\n\nAside from a few niggling points that only a reader of the book could complain about - maybe Harry's farewell to the Dursleys was too rushed - the film is a wonderfully atmospheric prelude, a tight interpretation of its source material, and a perfect quiet before the storm.",

            "content": "Rating-8/10\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 is of course the first part of the end for Harry and all of his world who are stuck in some dangerous times. Voldemort is getting stronger and this is the first time we truly see raw emotion and drama, our young actors are getting better and the movies are getting oh so much darker. This for me is the first Harry Potter where drama rules the roost, it doesn't take those fantasy and family elements too heavily and what comes of this is a deeply insightful look at the characters emotions.\n\nOur plot follows basically anyone who is facing the wrath of Lord Voldemort and his dreaded death eaters, people are being killed everyday and even though they aren't characters we know, it still brings a more human touch to an otherwise magical affair. For me this is the point where Daniel Radcliffe's career in acting becomes solid, sure he has been doing this for years and years but this is him acting to his highest potential and the most skilful heights.\n\nDavid Yates yet again takes the helm and although I didn't feel he does very well, still does this well enough, I'm not the keenest on Yates's direction style but he never does a bad job though. I think the same goes for the adapted screenplay, not the finest of fine but it is still done well too and can at times actually create some of the most interesting scenes we have seen in Harry Potter. I think one area that this movie truly improves upon is the technical side, the special effects are absolutely flawless, made to perfection and the cinematography is as always wonderful, that's one point I feel is looked over with Harry Potter, the cinematography. \n\nA reason I think this is so fine and for me personally one of the best in the series is that it just breathes emotion, it isn't afraid of mixing the dark times with comedy and characters such as Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint) provide that. This movie I have seen is sometimes considered too slow, too much talking and maybe a little bit over long, I disagree. I found it to be exciting throughout, you never know what will happen next(unless you know the books of course), but even then it is still pulsating. \n\nA thing to mention for this film is the score, the long shadow of John Williams still hangs over the series but I feel it has now been taken off with a fine score from Alexandre Desplat. Desplat for me makes one of the best there has been in the series, the film is made much more tense with his style of music and particularly around the beginning his score is loud and triumphant but also brings the situation facing Harry and others down to earth. The design is also one of the best I have seen, the sets are fantastic and the choices of locations to shoot are breathtaking, this truly for me continues the step up the series took in Half-Blood Prince.\n\nOverall this movie surprised me, I have viewed this many times but never truly appreciated the heart of this movie, but also the dark side too. Full of action but also long conversations, many may consider this too long and boring to watch but for me this is a fine entry and sets up Part 2 in the best way it could do. Recommendation wise this actually is the first Harry Potter I feel the little kids may not like, it has it's scary moments and also very black scenes too, but they are done so well.",

David Yates took the characters of Harry Potter and transported them into a different movie, i'm sorry but 2 hours of boredom isn't my cup of tea. I've noticed throughout the series that after the first 3 it becomes more darker than it being a family movie. While watching The Deathly Hallows Part 1 it goes from Harry Potter that we all know and enjoy, to a completely different genre and feel of what made Harry Potter exciting. Is this really the direction it goes when reading the book?. The only character i enjoyed fully is Dobby, Dobby was a great elf. I'm sorry to the HP fans out there, but come on even you must've felt something was a bit off while watching Part 1, just hope Part 2 doesn't disappoint me.. maybe Dobby comes back and finds Harry's glasses all dented up in the rain and puts them on lol..",

            "content": "Nah, fuck it.  I love this movie, and I can't stand it how everyone else says it's too boring and just filler before the last one.  You know what? I don't like the last one that much at all.  And if it weren't for this, then I would not have liked anything by David Yates.  But I just remember walking out of the cinema after this one, and for the first time thinking that they had finally delivered not just a great Harry Potter film, but an excellent film in general.  I thought that this one would never turn out well because of all the times the main characters use polly-juice potion.  But in fact, the scene when they infiltrate the Ministry is probably one of my favourite parts (I just love the way it manages to be both hilarious and intense at the same time).  I love the dancing scene between Harry and Hermione.  I love the animated section about the Deathly Hallows.  The part when that teacher gets eaten by the snake is such an effective beginning, and it perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the movie.  I loved the part when Harry fights the snake, and when Ron opens the first horcrux.  You know, there isn't really a single thing I don't love in this movie.  The acting is easily the strongest it's ever been, and Yates finally acts like a proper director and puts some creativity into the movie that isn't already set out by the source material.  The only thing they kind of did wrong was not having Dobby return in any of the previous movies, thus not quite managing the emotional weight that his death should have had.  I just think that it alienates those who have not read the books ten times each.  Because for them, the only time they've known the character of Dobby was from way back in the 'The Chamber Of Secrets', and he was fucking annoying in that.  I find it ironic that Hedwig's death and Mad Eye's death are so much sadder - even though the former is blasted away instantly, and the latter is never even seen - and yet the fan boys (well, girls) get all the fuck upset about Dobby's death when he felt like nothing more than an afterthought thrown in at the last half hour of the film, (as if they just suddenly remembered, and were like, \"Oh, shit, isn't that elf supposed to die in this one\").  It would be sort of like bringing Colin Creevey back, and saying, \"Hey, remember this douchebag? We're going to kill him off now, so even though you haven't seen him in four movies, you have to be sad, okay?\".  But I digress.  It is still a little sad.  And everything else in this film is just awesome.  It's like the only Harry Potter where I don't have to feel a little embarrassed about liking it so much.",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was always one of my less favourite of the Harry Potter films and I was slightly alienated from it in comparison to the other Harry Potter films because when I first watched it I found it a little bit too dark for my tastes, and I was thrown off by the fact that it no longer had the actual school of Hogwarts in its story.\n\nIn the many years since the first time I watched it, I myself have grown as a person, and watching all the Harry Potter films together leading up to this one allowed me to really harness the feeling of things to come. Although I still consider Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 to be one of my less favourite films of the series, I enjoyed it significantly more this time.\nThe flaws in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 are largely on the basis of the fact that it is the first of two films split from a single novel. While I am glad that the filmmakers did this to allow more Harry Potter cinema to live on, this leaves Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 with a constant feeling of it being more of a prequel than a film of its own right. There isn't too much that happens in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 that isn't small story elements dramatised and stretched out, and it is always leading up to something which happens in its sequel. It still has a lot of interesting elements, but it is inferior to its successor. Admittedly, I also missed the presence of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizadry and many of the characters I had grown to love from watching them grow up and teach there. But I accepted that that was just part of the story and I had to make due.\nAlso, the pacing is a little rough. At first, the film begins with a quick representation of the preparation for facing the dark world head on and getting people to safety. Things jump off in a rush and the pacing is constantly moving between quick and slow over the course of its 146 minute running time, and in that the film tends to lose track of certain elements. Within a very brief period of time, Harry Potter's treasured pet owl Hedwig is killed as Rubeus Hagrid attempts to get Harry Potter to safety. The story doesn't value Hedwig enough to give his death much dramatisation, and in a second he is forgotten. I don't know if this is the case with the novel, but in the film they just don't value a character like Hedwig enough to dramatise his death. He may be just an animal, but it's clear he meant something to Harry Potter, and the fact that he isn't valued enough as a character to receive a proper farewell just left me upset. When Buckbeak was thought to have been killed, he received dramatic treatment, and the fact that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 couldn't do the same for Hedwig upset me. It seems as if it upset Harry Potter less as well. I'm sure that if Daniel Radcliffe was given the right moment on screen he would depict his emotional response to the situation well, but since the script didn't give him that moment it isn't dealt with properly.\nBut despite an inconsistent pace, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 still serves as strong entertainment.\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 manages to hit a new point of climactic darkness for the series. Exiting from its Hogwarts setting, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 creates a thrilling atmosphere for the way that the characters have to be constantly on the move to prevent the enemies from catching up with them. The adventure theme that was absent in the preceding two Harry Potter films is present in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, and it makes it vastly entertaining. The scale of the adventure is huge and it is very dark and thrilling, so it returns to the roots of its original entertainment while maintaining the superior dark theme which has grown as the film series has developed. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 combines some of the best themes from the preceding Harry Potter films and ends up as another entertaining entry into the series.\nAnd visually, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is effective as well. Despite exiting the beloved Hogwarts setting, it manages to go into a bunch of settings which create both agoraphobic and claustrophobic moods. The visual style of the film is intense and enhances the dark atmosphere of things, especially through use of its cinematography which always captures the setting in the intended mood. It constantly captures the scale of things excellently, be it the large scale of the intro sequence, the small intense scale of its intense character-driven scenes or the simple focus of the actors' faces when they deliver intense lines. Essentially, the cinematography in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is its best since Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and it is a more notable visual quality of the film than its powerful visual effects and grand production design which all worked to keep the scale of the spectacle up and strong over the course of the film. The musical score keeps the film strongly intense as well.\nYet with the dark adventure theme of the film and the large scale, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 never steps far away from the importance of its characters. Director David Yates hits a high point for his role as the director of Harry Potter films because he finds the balance between keeping the film as a character focused story and a large thrilling adventure, and he deserves praise for stepping up his game in preparation for this film. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is the finest of David Yates' entries into the Harry Potter film series, and he gives the script a lot of treatment which ensures that it is entertaining and allows the actors plenty to work with. Without problem, the cast of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 give it their all and make the experience thrilling and compelling.\nDaniel Radcliffe who has spent 10 years dedicated to the role of the titular Harry Potter, and as he has grown from being a young boy, so has his character. The entire process of things has been exhilarating over the course of all preceding six Harry Potter films, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is the most intense and mature role yet. Harry Potter steps into a world where every turn could be potential death. With him and his two closest companions on the run from everything, it's like the entire world is his Precinct 13, and he can never give up on fighting back to make the world a better place for the good hearted. Daniel Radcliffe proves to easily capture the mindset of his character being in a world of evil, and it makes the entire experience more realistic and believable. With a rough edge and intense ability to put himself in the appropriate emotional state of thinking, Daniel Radcliffe spearheads his iconic role with ease once again, and he makes an excellent lead for the story.\nRupert Grint manages to do the same thing as Daniel Radcliffe with a performance that is equally as impressive. Rupert Grint shows off the most mature elements of Ron Weasley to date, temporarily eliminating the humourously awkward demeanour so that audiences can see the negative effect that the changing world has had on him as well. There is one specific scene in the movie where he delivers the darkest character elements of the entire series, and it is so different from the usual Ron Weasley character that it is rather shocking. This reveals the endeavour of Rupert Grint's skills as an actor, and it uncovers a side not previously explored which intensifies and complicated the experience of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, all while revealing just how skilled an actor Rupert Grint has become. His performance in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is his finest of the series so far, and it is impressively dramatic.\nEmma Watson also manages to step up to the same plate and tackle to complicated elements of Hermione Granger with ease. In a world where booksmarts aren't as effective as in the school setting, she serves as an example of the flaws in the school system. Yet through her courage and wisdom, she manages to grow into a hero of her own for the story who makes it stronger and shares an impeccable chemistry with Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. As one of the three actors who have to hold the screen for most of the time in the film, more than in the preceding films, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 serves as a strong testament to her ability to hold the screen.\nThere are few actors who get all that much screen time outside of these three due to the focus resting solely on them, but the supporting cast manages to pull of some strong efforts as well.\nHelena Bonham Carter comes back into the dark role of Bellatrix Lestrange once again in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, and she manages to dominate dark atmosphere with the insanity she puts into the role, making yet another powerful impression on the series in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. Her evil demeanour and dark way of interactive with the cast is impressive, and it boasts some of her finest talents as a character actress. She faces the role head on without fear, and allows the fear to sink into the hearts of the viewers that encounter her instead and the resulting effect is thoroughly thrilling and entertaining.\nRobbie Coltrane's return to the role of Rubeus Hagrid is one of his most dramatic yet. Although facing minimal screentime, he has some serious moments with Daniel Radcliffe which allows their characters to share the relationship they have with audiences so that they can look back at where it all started. Robbie Coltrane delivers another effective, albeit brief performance as Rubeus Hagrid, and considering that he is my favourite character of the entire franchise I was rather pleased with the strength of his time on screen.\nAnd Imelda Staunton's return to the screen in the role of Dolores Umbridge takes no time before it reminds viewers just how much the character is truly hated. She is brought back as an antagonist again and plays on her corruption with power, and the simple presence of her angered me due to how I hated the character more than any other as well as pleasing me because of how skilled Imelda Staunton is at the role. Her presence is awesome and makes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 a greater viewing pleasure.\nLastly, Ralph Fiennes manages to come back to the role of Lord Voldemort once again for another powerful antagonistic performance. While the effect isn't as strong this time around because it's been seen before and is to be expected, but the fact that he naturally takes on the dark and evil elements of the character makes him an effective villain again.\n\nSo while Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 features a few pacing jumps and feels a bit much like the prequel that it is, it is more intense than any of the preceding Harry Potter films and returns to its adventure territory with dark themes which makes it an improvement over its two predecessors.",

Thankfully the bits intercut between are intriguing, emotional and sometimes thrilling, such as the fast paced forest attack, the discovery of the all important sword and Harry's birthplace in the sleepy snowy town. The opening sequence is good fun too, where Hagrid and co disguise themselves as Harry and get caught up in a fantastically over the top chase through the bustling streets of London. You'd think Harry Potter would look stunning in 3D but sadly the overwhelming darkness destroys any dimensionality and depth, leaving a rather flat experience, although some moments featuring snakes and wands have a decent 3D pop.",

There's also very little joy for Potter and co as they hit the road in search of the remaining Horcuxes; and a means with which to destroy them. What's a Horcrux you say? Well, a Horcrux is an item that Voldemort has used to store away a piece of his soul. By doing so, he makes himself almost unbeatable because to kill him completely, you also need to find all the Horcruxes and destroy them too. Sneaky bloke is old Voldemort. The nearest muggle (us normal humans) comparison would be losing your wallet, car keys and cell phone - really - could you survive without them?\n\nHallow's part one is beautifully made, and visually stunning. It's also the most mature Potter film to date, and the stakes in the story have never been deadlier.\n\nBeing that this last book has been split into two films, it's not surprising that plot wise, Hallows part one doesn't have a lot to say. While the time spent with Hermione, Ron and Potter does give our three young stars time to shine as actors. The film never fully justifies its existence in the first place. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid film. But it mainly exists to stretch out the series for a long as possible to rake in more box office treasure.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis is arguably the best looking Potter film to date, but it runs at a slow pace. You absolutely have to watch or read all the preceding movies/books before taking this on - it will not make sense otherwise. If you've enjoyed the other films in the series you'll likely enjoy this too.\n\nBest Format:\n\nIf this film ever got shown again at a theater near you, certainly try to catch that show. It's a great looking film. At home a HD showing is a must.\n\nBest moment for me:\n\nI loved the animated back story that explains what the Deathly Hallows is. It's slickly put together, and blends in perfectly with the rest of the film.",

Of course, my big problem with the film is that they've split it into two parts just to extend the life of the highly profitable Harry Potter film series. In doing this, they've inevitably made this film more pointless, especially since it's structured just like any other Harry Potter film.

            "content": "A crazy, crazy mix between The Return of the King and Picnic at Hanging Rock, the latest instalment in the Harry Potter world, is my personal favourite so far.\n\nAfter being ready to cry my eyes out less than 3 minutes in, I calmed myself down a bit and got ready to take the movie in. I've seen The Deathly Hallows Part 1 before, in Civic Dendy Premium cinema to be precise, but only that once, so I bought it on DVD and watched it again so I'd have everything fresh in my mind for this review.\n\nHallows manages to be completely epic, and have intense action/chase sequences, without ever succumbing the mindlessness that is accepted of adventure/action movies of late. It's the darkest Harry Potter movie to date (yes, even more so than The Half Blood Prince, which was the only Harry Potter film I've enjoyed on the big screen since the original), and this works hugely in its favour. I mean, okay yes there's a certain element of \"Kids Movie\" that's been completely lost, but let's be honest, why the fuck does that bother me? Most children in the world would be able to handle this sort of thing perfectly fine if they were allowed to, it's just the fact they're not allowed to that creates this sort of taboo, and because they're supposed to be scared by it, they are. I remember being young and having my dad read this book to me, he said he liked the book, and so I automatically had in my head that it was gonna be the most terrifying thing ever, because he was an adult, and children aren't allowed adult things... Grumble grumble... Anyway. Ahem, sorry. Back on track.\n\nSo yeah, it's dark, and as far as I'm concerned that's a good thing. What else is good? Well the special effects sure are bloody special, I'll tell you that much! Anybody who reads my reviews often (do those people exist?) will know that I have a whinge about effects-driven movies. Well, Hallows goes all out with the CGI, sure thing, but it doesn't adversely effect the film in the slightest. It improves it, it allows us to make real the things that are not, in order to propel the rest of the experience. It's technological magic woven into a great film, it doesn't try to be the entire film itself (see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix for a great example of this, the script relies entirely on SFX, rather than the merits of the story, what the fuck? What kind of script writer says \"Then there's a giant fire dragon, then there's some glass, and then BOOM and then, uh, they can make up some dialogue later. Seriously, the direction was great, but nobody had the power to save that piece of crap).\n\nThe animation sequence they used for the Deathly Hallows story was also really cool. Somewhat reminiscent of the intro to Hellboy II: The Golden Army. If any of you've seen that you'll get what I mean. Anyway. I thought it was pretty spectacular, and would've been cheaper than trying to do it the live-action way. See! Budget can't compare to brilliance.\n\nMost of all I was impressed by characters and actors. Yes, yes, I know I often am, but hey, what you gonna do? I liked this Scabior guy particularly (above). I didn't recognise him when I first watched The Deathly Hallows but he's actually Nick Moran (from Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, The Bill and The Amazing Grace). I'll be keeping an eye on him in future.\n\nOther spectacular entries to the cast included Bill Nighy (Doctor Who, The Boat that Rocked, the Underworld trilogy,Valkyrie, Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, Portrait of Evil, Wild Target, Love Actually) as the Minister of Magic; Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy's another personal favourite), as well as Rhys Ifans (The Boat that Rocked, Elizabeth: The Golden Age, Hannibal Rising, Little Nicky, Notting  Hill) as Xenophillius Lovegood (I've adored Rhys Ifans since primary school when I first watched him play Adrian in Little Nicky with Brett Price), Jamie Campbell Bower (Camelot, The Prisoner, Winter in Wartime, RocknRolla, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) as a young Gellert Grindlewald (who was supposedly the other Dark Lord, way before Voldemort's time) and David O'Hara (Cowboys & Aliens, The Tudors, Wanted, Doomsday, Braveheart) as Albert Runcorn (come on! He had a role in Doomsday! Like I'm not gone love him).\n\nThere was a couple of things I thought were less than fantastic though. The whole entire scene with Bathilda Bagshot made zero sense. I had the advantage of having read the books, so I got what was going on, but anyone who hasn't, wouldn't. Not to mention the fact that the subtle Nazi undertones of the book give way to a Final Solution regime, complete with propaganda in ye olde Third Reich font. And uniforms. With red bands. Yes. Seriously. I mean, I love Nazi films, but aren't we getting sick of when something goes wrong, we decide that everyone's Hitler? I dunno, it all seems a bit tired to me.\n\nBut know what? The fact that they have Nick Mother Fucking Cave alone is enough to make this a solid effort, and then when you chuck in the fact that it's actually a good movie! I got tired of The Philosophers Stone quickly, and The Chamber of Secrets even more so. The Prisoner of Azkaban I honestly still kind of enjoy. The Goblet of Fire was woeful, and The Order of the Phoenix took everything bad about it and made it worse. Half Blood Prince was quite good, but only as a lead up to this, which honestly is just a lead up to Part 2. Which I await anxiously.\n\n78%\n\n(If you're wondering why I just praised this film so highly then gave it less than 4stars, you have to consider that my preamble is me thinking about how much better it is than the others, whereas the final result relies entirely on the films own merits by itself, which is not much more than a set-up for Part 2, and doesn't work magnificently stand-alone) \n\n-Gimly",

But I say it's great because it allows the novel to be thoroughly adapted.  The fact of the matter is, there really was no way of making this adaption shorter.  Unlike all of the other Potter books, there are so many tiny details that are crucial to the plot, that they can't be left out.  So yes, I support the decision to make \"The Deathly Hallows\" a 5-hour adaption.\n\nAs for \"Part 1\" specifically, this is the plot-driven part.  This is the one that has a lot of the character development and establishes a lot of the stuff that pays off in \"Part 2\".  That's not to say this movie doesn't have any action.  This is still another fun Potter film.  The big aerial chase at the beginning and the scene at the Ministry of Magic are both some of the best action scenes in the series.\n\nI will be honest though.  This movie does slow down during the second act.  Harry and Hermione have an awkward dancing scene, but that's it.  The film does pick back up once Harry and Hermione visit Godric's Hollow, so hang in there.\n\n\"The Deathly Hallows Part 1\" is a very close adaption of the book, and I was happy about that.  Should you see it?  Yes, absolutely!  This is \"Part 1\" of the finale that so many have long-anticipated.  But I should warn you.  One of the best things about Rowling's writing is that every little detail comes into play in this finale.  So before you watch \"The Deathly Hallows\" (both parts), at least watch all of the movies again.  Really, you should read all of the books, but at the very least, rewatch the movies.  That way you can see all of those little details pay off.",

With this one being split into two movies and just returning from seeing it all i can say is not only where is part two but the fans expected alot more but it was still enjoyable. Iam a huge Harry Potter fan have seen every since they came out but never read the books and i was very excited to see this one considering it is part 1 of the grande finale and i expected alot and i got half of what i was hoping for. As a stand alone movie it dose not work but if your going to see part 2 then good this movie is just being split so u can watch the next one which i hope u all will cause as an introduction to the movie or part 2 whatever it is very enjoyable and a good exprience but this is not the best harry potter yet but ithink that part 2 will be that is why i think Harry Potter And the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a 4.5 out of 5.",

I will admit, this film starts of exciting. The escape form Harry's old house with everyone drinking polyjuice potion to Harry's infultration into the Ministry of Magic, all brought some genuine excitement. But once our heroes get stranded in the country side, man is it a snooze fest. They don't do anything! I wouldn't mind so much if they talked about stuff that was interesting. But instead, we get a hints of Dumbledore past which still doesn't make sense to me, and dream sequences about something to do with Olivander's wand shop? I still don't understand it. It seems like this film sprung on a lot of backstory to keep track of but they tell it to us in such strange ways. There is a reason why people say to skip this film in the Harry Potter film series.

            "content": "Harry Potter: The Deathly Hallows Part 1\n\tThe movie I'm doing is Harry Potter: The Deathly Hallows Part 1. It is about this wizard boy named Harry and he travels to different places to find stuff to defeat an evil wizard guy. The things they need to find are horcruxes. A horcrux is a part of the soul that you can hide to make you almost impossible to defeat, but if someone finds the horcrux and destroys it then the person becomes weaker. They are trying to defeat Tom Riddle a.k.a. Lord Voldemort because he wants to take over the wizard world. \n\tThe movie starts out at a Harry's friend Ron's  house. The headmaster of a wizard school known as Hogwarts died and he was Harry's friend. This old person comes and gives Harry, Ron, and Hermione something Dumbledore left them. Then later there is a wedding and it gets caught on fire by some deatheaters some of Voldemort's followers. Harry and his friends' apparate (teleport) to London and go to a caf\u00e9. There are more deatheaters there and there is a small battle. Then they go to a house that other people used for the Order of The Phoenix which was an order that tried to stop Voldemort 2 years ago. Then an elf/servant named Kreacher tells them that his master had a horcrux but then he gave it to him before he died but then someone named Mundungus Fletcher stole it. So then the elf/servant goes to try and find him. He comes back with Mundungus and a free elf/servant named Dobby. Mundungus tells them that he sold to a lady. That lady is a very important person in the Ministry of Magic. Harry and his friends kidnap people who work there and use a potion to make them look like the people that they kidnapped. They get the horcrux which is a necklace right when the potion starts to where off. They apparate to a forest where one of his friends get hurt. Harry helps his friend and then his other friend sets up a tent that looks really small but on the inside it is really huge. After she sets that up she sets up a protective border around their camp. The spell wears off and then wizard-hunters capture them and take them to Harry's enemy from school's house where they have a prison in their basement along with some of Harry's other friends. The free elf/servant Dobby comes back to save them. With the element of surprise Harry and his friends escape after an epic battle but someone throws a knife right before they apparate and the knife goes with them and kills Dobby. \n\t  I will categorize the characters by good and evil. The good guys are Harry, Ron, Hermione, Kreacher, Dobby, Luna, and Mr. Olivander. The bad guys are Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange, Snap, Lucius Malfoy, Narcissus Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy.\n\tThere are many settings and I will name 5. A forest, The Ministry of Magic, Draco's House, The Order of the Phoenix hangout, and Ron's older brother's house.\n\tOverall I think the movie was good. Although Dobby died I really liked it. I've watched a lot and it is one of my many favorite movies. I give it a 4/5",

Everything feels very disjointed, what with the constant hopping from one field to another, from one forest to another and so on whilst bearing hardly anything fruitful in regards to defeating Voldemort. Admittedly i didn't read the book, i gave up after not being particularly engrossed, so the movie may just be a brilliant portrayal of it, but as somewhat more casual a viewer the events on screen really don't do anything for me. The trio become worryingly dull and it's really only Emma Watson that has come into her own. The lack of the majority of the supporting cast who we see at the beginning also dulls the energy of everything too. I suppose it just doesn't feel as magical but of course if the book goes in this direction then who can blame the movie? Well, it has to end somewhere but i recall enjoying part 2 a lot more.",

Initially, I felt the movie was very well made but a little slow. Although it's true in the book the first half is not as action-packed as the second, I thought the movie was a good 3.5 / 5.\n\nNow, after 2 years, it's a whole other movie. It's damn right amazing. Soooo much action, so much excitement the whole way through. Yes, there was that 20 minutes of relatively little action, but that is to be expected. It was relatively very loyal to the book and yet felt even faster paced.\n\nThere are some amazing scenes in the second darkest film in the series (the darkest of all being Deathly Hallows part 2). The diner exchange is fantastic. The Nagini attack is scary as $#^@. The scenery throughout is mind boggling! Cinematography epic win! Some of the best footage of scenery in a mainstream film.\n\nThe acting bar is again raised, this time to a solid performance from all actors. Although if I need to be honest, among the leading three I feel Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest while Emma Watson is the strongest. I understand it must have been tough selecting these actors at the age of 11 trying to see who would blossom into the strongest actor a decade later.\n\nMusic is stellar. VFX are photo-real and amazing. Production value is through the roof (as it should be considering the budget!). Overall, Warner Bro's have done a fantastic job bringing the books to life! Particular kudos to Yates on a fantastic series of movies. Really came out of nowhere for the Win!\n\nOverall, an excellent and necessary watch before the finale: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2!",

It allows for more detailed story telling but it becomes less disciplined and becomes a little overburdening. There is a barrage of minor characters both new characters and barely mentioned characters from early in the series. It is a little hard to keep everything straight, even for an enthusiastic nerd, like myself. Thankfully knowing every minor character and every detail is not essential to enjoying the experience. It is nice to see that there is more to plot to unfold and evolution of characters to keep things interesting this far into the series.

Unfortunately, very little of this is contained in this penultimate chapter.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely none of this film takes place in Hogwarts, which means that almost none of the characters that we've come to very much enjoy seeing are in this film. Harry, Ron, and Hermione eat up almost all of the screen time, while their character flaws are more noticeable than ever. Other than Bellatrix, most of the villains get only a single scene.\r\n\r\nNeville is seen once, gets one line, and has completely lost his shy, clumsy personality that made him so likable in the previous films. Luna Lovegood is hardly in the film at all. And of course, almost none of the Hogwarts teachers are in this film. The one character that DOES return however, is Dobby- the house elf that makes Jar Jar Binks seem intellectual. Still, he only gets a few scenes. New characters like Xenophilius Lovegood and Rufus Scrimgeour get sadly little screen time.\r\n\r\nThere is almost no humor in this movie. This is most likely due to the darker tone, but the film is so dreadfully dull, a little more comedy would've helped things considerably.\r\n\r\nThe visual effects don't get too many chances to show off in this film compared to the previous entries, but the effects do sparkle when they're on screen. Admittedly, there is one less-than-convincing snake, but other than that, the visuals are great, though less so than the last four films.\r\n\r\nThe pacing is so absurdly slow that one will feel every second of the 146 minute run time. While the other Potter films have also boasted lengths of similar size, they never felt nearly as long. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows drags and drags.\r\n\r\nI didn't even feel like it was building up to anything either. Other than in the very last scene, there's no great sense of anticipation. The whole film feels plotless and aimless. \r\n\r\nThere were really only two truly well done scenes. One involved Hermione Granger reading a sort of fable about three men meeting death, which utilizes some really nifty animation, though this sequence would've probably been enhanced by some music, as there is none during this segment. The other brief, but notable scene involves Bellatrix torturing a main character. This is notable because it's painful and horrific, without actually showing anything. It's by the strength of the onscreen acting that this scene is so successful.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the acting has not slipped much. The main trio of Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are still solid in their roles. Still, as they're basically the only characters we see for most of the film, there's not much else to say in regards to acting.\r\n\r\nThe music was immensely disappointing given the composer on board: Alexandre Desplat. There was not a single moment where the score stood out. The entirety of the music felt like underscore, though in all honesty, that's really all it was. Now, this isn't really Desplat's fault. There simply isn't much for a score to do in this film, as nothing really ever happens during the movie. Still, this seems to be the weakest of the Potter scores thus far (a spot previously held by the score for the Half-Blood Prince by Nicholas Hooper).\r\n\r\nBoring, uninteresting, and painfully slow, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 takes nearly everything that made the previous films so entertaining, and throws it all out the window. A disappointment in nearly every respect, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 lacks the sense of magic, wonder, and -most importantly- fun that this film very much needed. Deathly Hallows: Part 2 already has the expectations of keeping up the standard of a successful film series. Now it has to make me feel like watching this tedious and frightfully dull film was actually worth it.",

            "content": "\"I should be the one to kill Harry Potter.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here we go with the beginning of the end of the Harry Potter films. It had a rough beginning (Sorcerer's Stone), but the fact that the franchise has improved since its beginning is beyond me. Now we come to the second to last film, and it's incredible, even if we know that the film ends in an abrupt cliffhanger.\r\n\r\nVoldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has gone at his most powerful and leads an all-out mission to destroy Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). He and his followers have taken over the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts itself. Harry, along with Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), bond together to find the remaining Horcruxes that can destroy Voldemort once and for all. But since Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) never told Harry where to start, the quest turns into a nightmare, filled with romantic tensions, fears of heavy death and abductions, and dark secrets that might end Harry's journey for good.\r\n\r\nReturning to the franchise in this second to final chapter includes Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy, Alan Rickman as Snape, Timothy Spall as Wormtail, John Hurt as wandmaker Ollivander, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Brendon Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley, Julie Walters and Mark Williams as the Weasley parents, David Thewlis as Lupin, Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom,  and Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge, Harry's worst enemy from the classrooms.\r\n\r\nNew to the film includes Bill Nighy as the Minister of Magic before Voldemort takes control, Domihnall Gleeson as Bill Weasley, Ron's older brother, and Rhys Ifans as Xneophilius Lovegood, Luna's loony dad.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is incredible. Simply incredible. This is the darkest Potter film released at this point. Don't be fooled by the PG-13. Actually I think this almost got an R rating due to a dream sequence where Harry and Hermione are making out nude. But of coarse, the film has an audience, and the film gained its PG-13 and made the nude scene carefully where the film's not R. And either way, that nude scene is kind of creepy, dream scene or not.\r\n\r\nThe emotional intensity has heated up its highest here. Some of my favorite moments include a dancing scene between Harry and Hermione, Ron's fears of being left out, and in the most disturbing scene, Bellatrix in a very wild and creepy torture sequence to one of the three, and even though the true torture is not fully shown, that scene still leaves an impact due to the looks on the others who hear the torture. \r\n\r\nThe cinematography shines, probably the best cinematography in the entire franchise, even outdoing the outstanding shots in Half-Blood Prince. The dark looks are outstanding, the locations are dazzling, and even if those stones were CG, I couldn't tell, cause I was still wowed by the cinematography.\r\n\r\nThere's also some amazing visual effects here, obvious cause the Harry Potter franchise is known for its outstanding visuals. Dobby and Kreatcher return, and look outstanding as ever, the trio use heavy makeup in a very memorable Ministry infiltration scene, which is one of my favorite scenes in the film, Voldemort's creepy snake appears in some disturbing moments, and the best effect, a scene where there's not one, not two, but seven Harry's in one room. (\"Wow. We're identical.\") That still blows my mind. I'm also wowed by an animation storybook sequence explaining the films title.  \r\n\r\nThe casting, once again, is brilliant. We know how excellent Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are in their roles, and how mature they've got in the years we've known them, so I'll cut it short. As usual, they're excellent as ever, particularly Watson, who shines best. Grint is still very funny, and Radcliffe is still good in the emotions. Ralph Fiennes is perfect as Voldemort, and makes a villain that leaves tons of impact. The other big actors here are mostly given cameos (Carter, Rickman, Issacs, Coltrane, etc.), cause this is Harry, Ron, and Hermione's picture, but still, the small roles these actors have amazing presence and dominate the picture, especially Helena Bonham Cater and Alan Rickman.\r\n\r\nFor the final two films, the film is scored by Alaxendre Desplat, and it's spectacular. In some moments, you'd think that John Williams returned, but in others, you don't. But that's fine, cause Desplat's score is the best score that Williams never made. It's exciting, it's chilling, especially in the opening theme, and in some cases, really haunting. I'm impressed, especially that it's not Williams.\r\n\r\nDavid Yates had brilliant direction in Order of the Phoenix, but disappointed me a bit in Half-Blood Prince. Here, Yates is back on track, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is the most trilling, dark, disturbing, chilling, exciting, and emotionally satisfying Potter film, until Part 2 came out, which really sums up both films and the franchise as a whole.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you're up against, Mr. Potter, but you can't fight this war on your own. He's too strong.\"",

            "content": "I have never read the Harry Potter series, so I am unaware of how much was cut in the adaptation process. With that said, this is surely one of the weakest efforts in the whole Harry Potter series. Harry and Voldemort are preparing to fight each other, in this film. There are some minor skirmishes between Harry's wizard gang and Voldemort's death eater gang, but otherwise, the focus is on Harry, Ron, and Hermione trying to identify, find, and destroy an object that holds part of Voldemort's life. The three actors who play the main characters have never been more emotionally invested, but I would have liked more of the other folks. Given Malfoy's role in the last film, I expected him to have more than two scenes in a two-and-a-half-hour film. That's not a problem, if you enjoy spending the majority of time with our three musketeers. Ron grows more possessive over Hermione, while Harry and Hermione try to cope with the isolation of their mission. If the director had cut some scenes, I would have taken in the isolation more so than the boredom they must have endured in their several months alone. The opening is beautifully shot though, depicting what all of the characters must do before leaving for the first battle. Hermione's moment is especially heartbreaking, both in the opening and how it affects her character later in the movie.\n\nThe special effects are as good as they have always been, but there were some scenes that suffer from too-much-CGI. I fully understand why any scene with a magical-looking spell, mystical creature, or broomstick-flying has CGI, but then there is the unusual motorcycle/broomstick chase scene in the first half hour. For practicality and safety, I also understand why the scene had so much CGI, but the action was not as thrilling as it could have been, had they tried to recreate the magic of the moment without magic. And I did not care for the prolonged deathly hallows tale, told through silhouetted, Burton-esque animation. I won't take everything else for granted though, because this is a Harry Potter film and, as a part of such a grand story, it is a fantastic predecessor to what should be a spectacular finale. (I have never seen Pt. 2, by the way.) Pt. 1 does not stand well on its own, due to lack of significant events or changes, but in the context of the series, it should definitely satisfy fans.",

Also kudos to Dan, Rupert and Emma (who are better than ever) for fantastically conveying the trio's isolation from the rest of the world. It's probably a darker movie than the last 4 combined but there are still some very funny and very sweet scenes in it.  Loved the acting, writing, directing, special effects, everything but yes we will have to wait until Part 2 to really see the payoff of the story.

Exercendo desta vez uma cr\u00edtica aos grandes e macabros sistemas pol\u00edticos e militares que ocorreram na metade do s\u00e9culo vinte na Europa (como, por exemplo, o nazismo), o filme obt\u00e9m um sucesso genu\u00edno ao parodiar estes sistemas, adaptando-os \u00e0 trama da s\u00e9rie com muito sucesso e muita compet\u00eancia. A linguagem visual do filme \u00e9 simplesmente espetacular: o diretor David Yates investe em uma fotografia muito escura e muito sombria, dando ao filme um aspecto sinistro e dram\u00e1tico (muito semelhante a fotografia de filmes que retratam a Segunda Guerra Mundial, por exemplo). O roteiro de Steve Kloves e a dire\u00e7\u00e3o de Yates trabalham com quase a mesma perfei\u00e7\u00e3o realizada pelo livro de mesmo nome da J.K.

Algumas sequ\u00eancias se assemelham tanto as do livro que at\u00e9 mesmo os di\u00e1logos e as a\u00e7\u00f5es dos personagens s\u00e3o incrivelmente parecidas. Os atores est\u00e3o \u00f3timos, com destaque para o trio principal, que evoluiu muito neste pen\u00faltimo filme. Emma Watson consegue mostrar do que ela \u00e9 capaz neste cap\u00edtulo do que em qualquer outro anterior. Rupert se sai muit\u00edssimo bem na sequ\u00eancia da briga entre ele e Harry. E Daniel \u00e9, sem d\u00favidas, o maior destaque dos tr\u00eas (pelo o menos neste cap\u00edtulo), interpretando muito bem as cenas de drama e de a\u00e7\u00e3o. Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort) est\u00e1 deslumbrante em uma das primeiras cenas do filme, metendo medo com a sua voz rouca e maligna. Jason Isaacs tamb\u00e9m se destaca em seu papel como o Lucius Malfoy, transmitindo o medo e a afli\u00e7\u00e3o do seu personagem com maestria. Os efeitos especiais, apesar de discretos em algumas cenas ( as cenas da cabana, do Minist\u00e9rio) e nada discretos em outras (a cena dos Sete Potters e a batalha a\u00e9rea) s\u00e3o incr\u00edveis. A confec\u00e7\u00e3o de Dobby \u00e9 espetacular: e aliais \u00e9 este personagem que vai trazer uma das cenas mais comoventes e belas de toda a s\u00e9rie.

            "content": "It's finally here: the first part of the official end of the Harry Potter series. The books have long since passed, but fans that need their Harry Potter fix still have two movies left with which to indulge themselves. And the fans seem to know it if box office numbers have anything to say on the matter. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (part one) pulled in $125 million in the U.S. on its first weekend alone, and over $200 million extra internationally, smashing the franchise record of $102 million domestically for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. That number is nothing to scoff at either, especially considering the controversy over the splitting of the final book into two films. Fans of the books often wondered how they were going to pull off The Deathly Hallows back when we all thought there was only going to be one movie; the book, after all, is 784 pages long, and as much as the filmmakers have cut from previous books, doing so for The Deathly Hallows is incredibly tricky considering the number of plotlines needed to fulfill the agenda set up in The Half-blood Prince.\n\nFor that reason alone, The Deathly Hallows (part one) is perhaps the closest an HP film has come to the original source material since the original two films (directed by Chris Columbus). Couple with the two movie split, this is a huge gamble. If you're going to split a movie in half, you have to justify that by creating a complete narrative that avoids leaving the audience with a cliffhanger, but is also open enough to warrant seeing the final installment. The Deathly Hallows (part one) comes close to meeting this task, though knowing whether the film is truly effective depends on what happens in the final half of the sequence. Still, what The Deathly Hallows (part one) offers\nfans is an action-packed fantasy film that doesn't forget its core audience and sets the stage for the true climax of the series in part two.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (part one) drops the audience right where The Half-Blood Prince left them: in darkness. Voldemort has risen to power, influencing and threatening the safety of the wizarding world. The Ministry of Magic is rapidly trying to control public hysteria, mudbloods (wizards born of muggle parents) are being targeted and killed by Voldemort's army, and Harry Potter is in greater danger than he ever was before. But Harry Potter and his friends have a job to do: they have to find the last few horcruxes-the pieces of Voldemort's soul that prevent the Dark Lord from completely dying-and destroy them so as to end Voldemort's reign and bring things back to the way they were. And in their journey they'll discover more about themselves, the world around them, and what they must do and sacrifice to protect everything they hold dear.\n\nThe Deathly Hallows is perhaps one of the darkest of the Harry Potter films, even when compared to The Order of the Phoenix. Unlike previous films, the government-level adjustments to wizarding society in The Deathly Hallows are manipulated directly by Voldemort, instead of by the fear of what people are often unwilling to acknowledge (in the case of the wizards in The Order of the Phoenix, it is the fear of Voldemort's return, which, of course, proves to be a somewhat ironic fear, since it more or less plays into Voldemort's hands). The result is a more personal kind of darkness: characters betray one another-even people you'd never expect-proving that it has become increasingly more difficult in this world to know who to trust; likewise, people quickly begin to sacrifice their freedoms in the fear of something they feel helpless to resolve. Astute viewers will immediately begin to draw parallels between The Deathly Hallows and our own world, particularly given the changes in the last few months in the U.S. and elsewhere. Unlike our world, however, the one presented in The Deathly Hallows is reasonably projected from Voldemort's rapid removal of wizarding society's security blankets. Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it had always been, even given the handful of dangerous incidences that have occurred there over the franchise. For Harry and his companions, this is doubly problematic, because what The Half-blood Prince showed them is that Voldemort can get to them no matter where they go. The Deathly Hallows continues this trend to even greater effect-without security blankets, Harry, Hermione, and Ron are both on the run and more desperate than ever to find the horcruxes they need to destroy Voldemort for good, because sooner or later, Voldemort and his men will find them and kill them.\n\nThe shift in tone, beginning most clearly with The Order of the Phoenix and culminating in The Deathly Hallows, coupled with the radical change of scenery, also make possible the ramping up of the action that has been teasing us for six movies. There are fewer restrictions on the characters, good and evil--both because of the conditions of the emerging world and the original source material--and this freedom is reflected clearly in the action. Duels are rugged and uncontrolled-an obvious contrast to the previous six films, all of which take place in the confines of school and the educational structure. Likewise, The Deathly Hallows is unfettered by a narrative dominated by children, not simply because the main characters are now practically adults; if anyone remembers the enormous duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort-and loved it as much as I did-then they'll be equally pleased with The Deathly Hallows, where advanced levels of magic are in higher frequency and presented in situations entirely external from the school, thus adding a certain degree of realism to the story. That is to say that magic in The Deathly Hallows is not centered on training in a school, but on using it to achieve one's personal goals, whether that be murder, manipulation, or pleasure. For example, we see the polyjuice potion used both as a deception for protection against certain death and as a spy device under much more serious circumstances than spying on one's fellow classmates-specifically, to kill. I've always been pleased with how the filmmakers have attempted to render the magic from the books, and there are certainly no complaints here.\n\nWhat The Deathly Hallows seems apt to do is open the floodgates that were gently cracked in The Order of the Phoenix (in the Dumbledore/Voldemort duel), but pushed closed again by The Half-blood Prince (arguably one of the worst films of the series). Harry, Hermione, and Ron are all obviously coming into their own, more secure in their abilities and unafraid to show it. Likewise, the loosening of Voldemort's leash-the danger posed to him by the Ministry of Magic and its allies--makes the first major sequence a thousand times more threatening than anything we've seen before precisely because of where it is placed: the muggle world, with a handful of overlapping spaces. The Deathly Hallows is far more action-oriented than previous franchise films, which makes for a far more rushed plot than HP fans might be used to. While this might seem like a criticism of the film, the quick pace actually enhances the desperation exhibited by the characters. Harry, Hermione, and Ron all ride on the same sheer dumb luck (as McGonagall would say) that got them through every major film plot in the series, not because they have a choice-which one might argue they had when they were younger-but because there are no other options.\n\nThat doesn't mean the plot doesn't have its problems. For viewers of the films who are unfamiliar with the books, much of what happens in The Deathly Hallows will feel incomplete. This is because the first half is intimately tied with the second. There are a number of elements that ring suspiciously of deus ex machina, for example, but which will-we can hope-be resolved nicely in the second part. Whether this is a problem of advertising or simply a mistake on the part of the filmmakers is difficult to say. The one crucial failing of the producers for The Deathly Hallows is that they have decided to wait until next summer to release the final installment while also doing very little to help viewers understand why both pieces have to be seen to get the full picture-I would argue that non-readers of the series are not particularly interested in issues of adaptation, which is fair.\n\nOne of the other flaws with the film is the visuals. While most of the CG renderings are beautifully done-such as the first major fight sequence and the various uses of magic throughout the film-the one weakness involves much more complicated CG elements: characters. One of my biggest pet peeves is in how filmmakers use CG. While the Harry Potter films have never been at the highest end of the visual scale, the rendering of several familiar characters in The Deathly Hallows could have been done more efficiently, particularly since I know what will happen in the second installment. Dobby, for example, looks less detailed than he did when he first appeared in The Chamber of Secrets; the same can be said for Nagini-Voldemort's snake companion, who has a fairly prominent role in this particular film. Maybe this has more to do with my familiarity with the graphics quality of the last few years than with any degradation of the visuals in Harry Potter, but as much as I enjoyed the film, I couldn't help taking notice of how certain visuals didn't seem up to par. The good thing to take away from this criticism, however, is that the film is not as poorly rendered as The Expendables (2010), which did such a piss-poor job of rendering CG blood that I literally laughed out loud the first time the dark substance appeared on screen. To put it another way: the worst of the graphics in The Deathly Hallows are simply average, rather than exceptional (which I think the final installment of the film deserves).\n\nBut the shimmering star of the film has nothing to do with good graphics, high-flying action, or an appropriately rushed plot. Perhaps the greatest part of The Deathly Hallows is the chemistry between the main actors--Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint--and the supporting cast--who are only briefly on screen. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint work superbly together. Their comedic and emotional timing is arguably the strongest it has ever been, demonstrating that we are dealing with a group of actors who have not only grown into themselves, but into the characters as well. In a way, they have grown with their characters and seem remarkably at ease fulfilling their roles. Humor is particularly well played throughout the film, both for the main actors and the supporting cast members. Ron, as always, acts as comic relief, but his jokes are no longer placed in moments of childish fancy, since doing so would cheapen the moment. Instead, Ron's humor always acts as tension relief either during less-stressful sequences or at the ends of particularly dark ones. The supporting cast members are equally as funny. Fred and George (James and Oliver Phelps), for example, share a particularly touching moment early in the film in which humor is used as a kind of comforting device-and it works, giving the impression that these characters and the people surrounding them are all part of a real family unit. As much as the story focuses on Harry, Hermione, and Ron, the secondary cast members are equally as important, representing the solid ground on which the main characters rest their hopes and dreams. The fact that the secondary characters-with the exception of one or two new faces-move as smoothly on screen as our heroes-both in how they display the kaleidoscope of emotions that the opening thirty minutes of The Deathly Hallows offers and in how they relay humor to themselves and to us-makes losing oneself in the film remarkably easy. That's what we go to the movies for, isn't it? To lose ourselves. To become part of the world being presented before us. \n\nIn the case of Harry Potter, we're losing ourselves in a kind of dream, one that is full of adventure and wonder in a way that our own mundane world seems to be incapable of providing (it isn't actually incapable, but so many people assume it is). That's what we've been riding on since 2001: the awe-inspiring beauty of a world whose magic changes the very nature of how people interact with their surroundings. The Deathly Hallows is a continuation, but also a culmination and expansion on those moments of immersion. Now all we have to do is wait until July to lose ourselves one last time.\n\nDirecting: 4/5\nCast: 5/5\nWriting: 4/5\nVisuals: 3/5\nAdaptation: 4/5\nOverall: 4/5\n\n--This review originally appeared on my personal blog, The World in the Satin Bag.",

            "content": "I haven't always been kind to the film adaptations of the Harry Potter books because they always seemed to be missing something. J.K. Rowling created a world on the page that was robust and alive, populated by dozens of interesting characters and wondrous things to behold. The movies, mainly after the second installment seemed to miss the point. They always felt like Cliff Notes summaries. That's a complaint I've had with this series for about the last four installments. Yet, here we are at the end and at last they've gotten it absolutely right. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is the beginning of the end, the top half of a two-part finale that concludes in July. This is the best installment of the series, in my opinion, and the truest to Rowling's vision. Harry's destiny has been looming all along through some admittedly tiresome fore-bearings and now those portents of doom finally come to a head.\n\nThis film finds Harry being hunted by the evil Voldemort and his Death Eaters who know that the moment the lad turns 18, his protection spell will be lifted and he will be fair game. Some of Harry's professor's attempt to help him escape when an ambush is sprung that sends Harry, Ron and Hermione on the lam. The trio's flight from Voldemort, and the now-corrupt Ministry of Magic, makes up the bulk of the movie as they try and obtain the horcruxes, objects that contain various pieces of the dark lord's blackened soul.\n\nThey set off across the English countryside never fully aware of who they can trust. The scenes outdoors (there are no scenes at Hogwarts) leave time for a surprising amount of character development especially in the now strained relationship between Harry and Ron. Outwardly, Ron is worried that Harry is endangering in his family - inside, he fears that Harry is winning Hermione's heart. What comes of that conflict is something that has been missing from his series all along: these three young actors that we've watched grow up since childhood - Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson - are finally given room to act. Their performances are compelling. They are angry, frustrated, tired, hungry and scared out of their wits. They play each note just right. Grint plays Ron with an undercurrent of bitterness. Watson began her performance as a bookworm but has now become the logic center. Radcliff maintains his performance with a perfect heir of dread and melancholy.\n\nThose performances are the foreground of a movie that is beautifully produced. Director David Yates and his cinematographer Eduardo Serra (who shot Blood Diamond and Unbreakable) match the story's grim tone by keeping the skies eternally overcast and the landscape fore-bidding and lonely at the same time. This film, unlike previous installments, has a heavy tone that owes more to The Lord of the Rings. This time they aren't content with just a press stamp copy of the books. They really make the story come alive especially in moments when we think the trio is safe but then the trap is sprung. There are visual tricks here that I didn't expect, most delight is a breathtaking, and oddly beautiful, animated sequence told in shadow as Hermione reads the story of The Deathly Hallows.\n\nThere is a sense of melancholy that sets in with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I and not all of it has to do with Harry's fate. In a way, we sense the closing of an era. These are characters that we have come to love, that we've watched grow up and now they head into their final battle and their destiny. We know that Part II will focus mainly on tying up loose ends (I hope it will be more than that) but if the bottom half of this finale is as compelling as the top, we're in for a very wonderful send-off.",

Spay special attention to Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. He has been given screen time only in chunks, but if you watch him closely, you'll see what a three dimensional villain he is. At first I felt they got him wrong. I expected an unstoppable force with tenacity in his calmness with the likes of Darth Vader, and now I realize that they nailed this villain so well. But he goes through his own pain and anguish in his hot pursuit of Potter and his claim to power. He too goes through a whirlwind of emotions.\nThis is an amazing movie. This not only has the special effects and action, but also the minimalist acting of art-house films. Try to take off the Harry Potter label and look at this movie just once.

Easily the worst of the seven films that have trickled out since 2001, \"Deadly Hallows\" forgets everything that made the Potter films so endearing.  And that would be the depth of felling it holds for its wide array of charmingly eccentric characters.\n        In \"Deadly Hallows,\" that magic dissipates behind a thick cloud of melancholy and the type of angst befitting an apocalypse more than a sprightly fantasy. It's a bummer, all right, but not as big a bummer as the realization that this time around we'll be without Hogwarts, and the cliques, rivalries and romances brewing within its formidable walls. \n        That means no Manerva McGonagall, Horace Slughorn or Moaning Myrtle, and only fleeting moments with Hagrid, Snape and a posthumous Dumbledore. Heck, even Ralph Feinnes' dreaded Voldemort barely puts in an appearance. The rest of the time, we're stuck with the three least compelling of J.K Rowling's creations: Harry, Hermione and Ron. \n      OK, they were cute as kids, but now they're adults, quite dull ones, too. And as such, they've reached an age when Hollywood demands that they go on a coming-of-age road trip, complete with romantic entanglements, naked embraces and huge misunderstandings. \n      The film would like you to believe it's Voldemort and his ruthless band of Death Eaters at the heart of our heroes' woes. In reality, it's Steve Kloves' cumbersome adaptation of Rowling's final Potter novel that's the bigger threat. \n       Long (141 minutes), unfocused and utterly confusing to anyone who hasn't read the books, Kloves script tires to cram as much of the novel in as he can. Well, everything but the heart and charm. Sure there are the occasional transcendent moments, like the naked embrace Harry and Hermione share in Ron's vivid imagination, and the moment when Harry visits the graves of his murdered parents. But most of the film consists of static shots of Harry, Hermione and Ron exchanging expository dialogue.\n          Yet, despite all the explanations, you're still baffled by what in the heck is going on. If you figure it out, let me know. But I think it has something to do with Harry and his wizardly sidekicks trying to round up pieces of jewelry and other trinkets containing concentrated amounts of Voldemort's wicked evilness. \n        It's just a lot of smoke - literally and figuratively - that evaporates into thin air without meaning or context. Far more interesting, but much less explored, is the darkness lurking deep inside Harry, Hermione and Ron. It's some pretty unsettling stuff, too. But you believe it's the script bringing it the surface more than Voldemort. \n        At least it doesn't seem as phony as the sub-par special effects, used mostly in service of the film's three or four lame action scenes. The only memorable visual trick arrives when it becomes necessary for six of the kid wizard's closest allies to drink a potion that transforms them into Harry clones. \n        Alas, seven Potters are not better than one, but at least the bit of cinematic trickery distracts you from the laborious script and David Yates' prosaic direction. It's Yates' third Potter film (he also did the previous two and will handle the grand finale coming out in July) and he's still searching for consistency in tone.\n         The movie is literally all over the map, with Yates struggling to find an effective way to mix the various strands of romance, comedy, drama and adventure into a cohesive unit. Often, \"The Deadly Hallows\" feels like bits of four different movies poorly cobbled together. \n           The best parts, as you might expect, come via the Death Eaters and their boss, Valdemort. They are frightening, but also quite funny, mostly courtesy of Helena Bonham Carter's marvelous portrayal of Drago Malfoy's crazy aunt Bellatrix Lestrange. More of her cyclonic bursts of energy would have made \"Deadly Hallows\" much less of a drag, as it fumbles and stumbles its way toward next summer's finale. Until then, let's pray to the pagan gods that next time the wands won't be so wan.",

Sow, this is the first Harry Potter I have ever seen, don't get me wrong just because I rated this movie three stars, this movie didn't cause me a bad impression o the series it all, but this movie had a 7.6 in IMDb because of the Harry Potter geeks who love the movies and know the name of all the creatures and spells and things like that, this movie will be much more enjoyed by those persons. But one thing is for sure, this movie gave me interest to watch the Part 2 of the Deathy Hallows who is considered by several persons as the best of the Harry Potter series.\n\nDavid Yates is the guy who directs this movie, he is known from directing almost all of the movies from the Harry Potter series, directed this movie good. Daniel Radcliffe takes the famous lead role pretty well, I liked his character and I don't think he had a bad perfomance, Daniel is basicly just known from all of the Harry Potter movies. Emma Watson is probably the best young actress in this flick, I really like her and she had a really good perfomance, she knows how to act very well, Emma is known from all the Harry Potter flicks as well. Rupert Grint was not that much appreciated by me, Daniel and Emma had much better and much important characters (and perfomances as well), he was just okay in this movie, he didn't had that much of a perfomance, Rupert is known from all the Harry Potter movies as well. The rest of the cast is completed by Helena Boham Carter and Ralph Fiennes, they are good actord and they had a fine perfomance in this movie, but their screen time was not that long as you think. Sow, as you can see this movie has a great cast, there are several good perfomances and for a Brittish cast, they were a fine choise.\n\nHarry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) will have to find the pieces of Voldermort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul and destroy them with a special sord that they will also have to find, if they don't that, he wil remain immortal. They will also have to find three objects who are the only things who make them able to destroy his evil enimie who wants to kill Harry. Interesting plot, broked in two parts, I guess this movie coodn't have that much of an ending because of that, this movie had a broken plot, so this was like the first half of a long movie, but I likedthe first half of the plot, it didn't had the all three things that a real movie requires, a beginning, a development and an ending, but I think this half of the plot cood make another Harry Potter chapter.\n\nSoundtrack, the soundtrack was not reminded by me, I can't remember a single theme for this movie, so I can't say if there was a good soundtrack or not. There wasn't that much action, but the small number of action scenes in this movie were just okay, Stupefy, bla, bla, bla. The special effects were really good, even though there were not that much of them, i think this movie went to the Oscars becuase of the special effects, I notticed them and they were really well made, much better than some other movies special effects.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, it gave me interest to watch the final movie of the series, wich is good. Since the beginning, I think this movie was being clever and entertaining, even though I coodn't understand most of the things they were talking about, I guess, for a first movie to watch, this is probably not the most recommended, it didn't make me had a bad impression of Harry Potter, because this is just half of the movie, they are now getting used to do that just to make some more money, but I think that this movie actually kind of needed that. This movie had really nice special effects, a nice cast, good action scenes, a great (broken) plot and everything together cood make a good movie, just to make you sure how much entertaining it is, I've seen that quantity of time that this movie has got and after I watched, it looked like a one and a half hour movie, even though this was not a perfect chapter of the series, it was really important, I'm sure the Part 2 is much better and it cood only be, this movie has the beginning, the half of the development and the Part 2 has the other half of the development and the end. Overall, to see the last movie, you will have to see this, but remeber, this is not a complete movie, but it's still an ejoyable half. This movie has a great cats, great special effects, good action scenes, a fine plot and overall, a fine and recommended movie. Frfom now on, I do like Harry Potter movies. Good.\n\nGood movie.

I don't see why this sequel has got less reviews as well as Harry Potter 4 and 5. Remember, this is the setup to our big climax that came out a year later. The story is that now Harry has the instructions to kill Voldemort with a bit of help from Professor Slughorn from the last movie, the trio have now discovered that Voldemort's powers are hidden in seven different objects known as Horcruxes. They already have destroyed the Philosopher's Stone in Harry Potter 1 and the diary in Harry Potter 2, now five more remain. If the trio don't destroy these Horcruxes, then Voldemort will remain immortal. Even if this book was split into two movies, it is still the first half of Harry Potter 7- Part 2 and counts as the other half of that film. SO there's no need to give separate percentages each. Even though it's the first half of the last movie, the franchise has already taken the ballsy direction. You thought killing Dumbledore was insane, well killing Dobby who was a fun character and was always trying to protect Harry in Harry Potter 2 is just as insane as that. I think this is the moment where we start to lose our beloved and important characters and this has been happening since Harry Potter 4 and Harry Potter 5.

This movie was full of great wizardry, special effects, emotion and compelling storytelling.  And to think we still haven't seen Hermione and Ron kiss yet!  Harry is bolder and the film continues to dip into darkness as Voldermort is clearly winning the early stages.  It'll be interesting to see who sides with who in the end.  It is also to see as the series has gained notoriety, bigger and better actors continue to get cast in some of these side roles, which greatly influence the storyline.  There are still some instances that don't make much sense like Harry skinny dipping in a frozen pond and surviving without hypothermia or Harry's inability to recognize Ron is under the influence of the amulet even though Hermione is right there saying he is before Harry kicks Ron out of the group briefly...All in all...a solid installment that definitely sets up the second half of the Deathly Hallows to be a sweet finish.",

I went to the\nmidnight showing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows pt.1 and was\nexceptionally amazed.As I'm sure you know the story; Harry, Ron, and\nHermoine have left school to destroy the objects called Horcruxes,\nwhich are needed to defeat the dark lord Voldemort while he rises to\npower. The tagline 'nowhere is safe\" really does set the dark and\nengaging tone of the movie because the trio is constantly being hunted\nand attacked by death eaters and snatchers. With Voldemort now in\ncontrol of the wizarding world hes sees that anyone who isn't\npure-blood (One parent wizard/witch and muggle) are abominations to\nsociety. The director made that whole scenario feel like a World War 2\nanti league which made to enemies cause to be important towards\neveryone in the wizarding world. And Then also there was a scene when\nthe tale of three brothers was told in a animated Tim Burton like theme\nwhich was interesting non the less. Though detail was taken out from a\nfew important key points but hey, its a movie based off a book they\ndon't always get everything, right? I also have to add that the chase i\nthe beginning to get Harry to safety was making me shake in\nanticipation, one of my favorite scenes no doubt. But one thing that\ndid bug me was the big story gap between the wedding and the breaking into the ministry which felt went by rather fast.With so much intense action throughout the movie also needs proper music. Alexandre Desplet did the soundtrack for pt.1 and did an awesome job in creating a dark and exciting mood to each scene. Every actor gave it their all in\nmaking themselves really feel the characters and never before was it\nthis good.Emma Watsons torture scene put my teeth on edge, and Harry's emotions from the troubles that surround him made him a grade A Harry Potter from the book. Dan, Rupert, and Emma will go down in history for this magical and extravagant series, but never have the risks and dangers ever been on such high a scale which is why this installment feels better than all the others combined. As a Harry Potter fan since the beginning I can honestly say I was pleased with every minute and that this not only was the greatest, dark, emotional, intense, and\naction packed Potter film it defiantly will be one of the best movies\nof the year. But this will please any hardcore fan as it will supply\nyou with everything you would need for the inevitable Deathly Hallows\npt.2 and with the epic follow-up of pt.1 the series will prove that\nthese books and movies that were part of so many others childhoods will always deliver big so then they can later on in life teach down that\nHarry Potter was one of the greatest series of all time.                                      -Brandon A.
