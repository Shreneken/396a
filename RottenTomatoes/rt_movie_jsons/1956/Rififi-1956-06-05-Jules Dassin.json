Expanding a minor smash-and-grab into a full-scale jewel heist, Tony and his crew appear to get away clean, but their actions after the job is completed threaten the lives of everyone involved.",

From the outset, we know that we are in rough company as our grizzled protagonist introduces us to the sultry world of gambling, night clubs and underworld scheming. While we might feel tempted to regard the famously meticulous heist sequence as the film's climax, we will find that many gripping surprises still await us as we follow the key players through the logic and the consequences of their ambitious crime. The film's ingenuity rests in the way that new and unforeseeable sources of tension lurch forward just as we're catching our breath, creating a hectic and disorienting sense of where we stand in relation to the story's unfolding. At every level, the mood of pure classic noir lights our way through an unpredictable labyrinth of crime, passion and betrayal that we're happy get lost in again and again.",

With a shoestring budget and having to cast himself in a decent role, Dassin managed to craft one of the most influential films of the heist genre. Yes, some of the elements have aged poorly (particularly the sexualization of all but woman with more than five lines) and would be panned today, but I was able to look past that. Even though the protagonists are seedy people, it is impossible not to really care about their predicaments and final fates. The heist scene is brilliantly executed, and the fallout wonderfully gripping. Perhaps the likes of Mission Impossible have taken the technical aspect of heist films to new heights, but this really is one of the best films for its means that could have been made. The audience receives the groundwork for almost every heist film to come as well as a wonderful noir atmosphere simply not replicated outside of its era. What a film.",

An atmospheric noir opening, a clever heist flick, and finally,the undoing of a criminal conspiracy brought about by a single loose thread. The cinematography is constantly creating engaging moments, particularly C\u00e9sar's murder and the final frenzied drive through Paris. Servais brings to life an exceptional portrait of a gangster - at once capable and intimidating but beaten down, displaying empathetic qualtiies but reinforcing that he is not at all a good person (particularly through his abuse of Mado). However, nitpicking the story a bit: what was the point of the police officers recognizing the gang's license plate outside of the jewelers during the heist? t didn't really seem to play a role in their undoing, and seems out of place, unless I missed some context. Overall still quite a take on the noir genre, refusing to lean on atmosphere alone and instead innovating. (4.5/5)",

Each character brought a unique flavor to the group and the film overall, while Dassin showed excellent touch, and at times restraint, to create an appealing blend of tension and introspection. This film should be viewed for the famous heist scene, if nothing else, and the scene somehow still exceeded the hype for me.\n\nSide note: One of my biggest movie pet peeves are during gambling scenes where inevitably money that was never on the table to start a hand ends up being tossed in along with car keys, house deeds, first born kids, etc which for anyone who has ever sat a poker table knows, isnt how it works. Good will was established quickly for me here when the opening scene featured a card game mid hand and a player was finally, and correctly, told that he could only bet what he had at the table.",

            "content": "I have a conditional love for heist movies. I can only get on board with them if the movie makes me like some of the characters. The easy way of doing this is getting me to side with the cops who are trying to figure out the crime and catch the bad guys. The more precarious balance is what Rififi manages to accomplish, where they establish crooks and somehow make me care about them. I\u2019m not sure why I was invested in the guys involved in this robbery, but I was holding my breath a number of times because I didn\u2019t want them to get caught. The actual scene that showed the heist was my favorite part of the film because it felt authentic, and had my heart racing with excitement. Building up to this moment was also a treat because they have a lot of little moments where we see them planning for the crime and problem-solving the obstacles they would find along the way. This section of Rififi also builds up the different characters so we could see what each person added to the team. The final act was the only aspect of Rififi that I didn\u2019t enjoy as much. After getting me on board with these characters, the last thing I wanted was to watch as things start to fall apart for them. It\u2019s kind of inevitable in a film like this, particularly one that feels more realistic, that it\u2019s not going to be so easy for the crooks to live happily-ever-after, but it didn\u2019t make it easy to swallow. I still enjoyed the tension in these scenes, and I liked how the protagonists matched wits with their opponents. The ending certainly didn\u2019t ruin Rififi for me, but it was a downer after I had enjoyed the first two acts so much. The cast is marvelous, and they all deliver great performances. However, Jean Servais was the real star of the show. Every time he was on screen I felt like I knew what he was thinking, and I loved how he was a few steps ahead of everyone else. Rififi should be included on every list of great heist movies, and is one that I would gladly watch again. In fact, I\u2019d probably enjoy it even more the next time because I already know how it will end.",

But the misogyny in this film is so blatant \u0097 way beyond even what's expected in films of this era \u0097 that it kind of overshadowed the whole experience for me, and took the film from 5 stars to 3.5 in my estimation. So that's what I'm gonna focus on here.\n\nThere is misogyny, big and small, throughout the film, and there is no female character who is spared. The worst though is when our 'hero', Tony, viciously beats his former lover and sends her back to her new man covered in welts, as a challenge to his 'ownership'. \n\n\"She didn't have to tell him,\" Tony says to his friend, \"it's stamped across her back\" \u0097 her voice in the matter is not even relevant, her body and who has power over it is all that's at issue.\n\nWhat's striking is the way he uses her body as a piece of meat, quite literally \u0097 he brands her just as a farmer would do stolen cattle. But actually less than that, because he sends her back to his enemy. She is just a scrap of paper he scrawls on heedlessly; a note passed between schoolboys organising a fight after class.\n\nThis was the most obvious, but far from the only, example. Other female characters seem to be there only to be insulted, ogled, or slapped around. The way the men in this film treat the women around then made me hate them all so much that *spoiler alert* their tragic ends felt like the only thing redeeming the film by the end.",

            "content": "This smart and gritty French film about a heist does not disappoint.   Jean Servais plays a tough guy who has just gotten out of prison and gets an offer to knock off a high-end jewelry store.   The opening scenes that establish the four thieves are memorable - Tony (Servais) running out of money while playing cards, Jo (Carl M\u00f6hner) and his young family, who will figure prominently in the film, Mario (Robert Manuel) getting bathed by his buxom wife (Claude Sylvain), and Cesar (director Jules Dassin), the expert safecracker who falls for Viviane (Magali Noel) as she sings the playful title song in a nightclub.   The club is owned by Grutter, the leader of a gang, and rival for Tony's old girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), and it's these two guys, Grutter and Tony, who will ultimately have to square off.  I have to say the early scene in which Tony tracks Mado down and then forces her to completely strip before beating her with a belt (off-screen) is very disturbing, particularly as we're going to find ourselves rooting for him later in the film.  It does establish him as a heavy though, loyal to the gang but if betrayed, merciless, which is consistent how he acts later.   I can't recall Servais cracking a smile in the entire film, and he plays the role beautifully.\n\nThe robbery itself is shown masterfully by Dassin.  In the planning stages, only a couple of the ways in which the thieves will pull it off are shown, an example of which is figuring out how to use a fire extinguisher to muffle the then state-of-the-art alarm system.   The execution of the crime is highly realistic, and I love how he used minimal dialog and music, so that the actions and facial expressions of the actors tell the story.   If only there were more films today that took a lesson from him!    We also see a flaw that will lead to problems for them, and the film is far from over after the crime - further drama and real tension await, but I won't spoil it.   \n\nIf you're looking for a caper film that among a few others set the blueprint for the genre, this is it.  I found out later Dassin had been blacklisted by Hollywood, and was even happier for the triumph of his fantastic direction here.  The script is taut, there are no wasted scenes, and on top of it all there are great shots outdoors in Paris.   Don't be frightened by the subtitles or by the fact it's black and white and was made in 1955 - it all holds up very well, and is superior to most of the action films of today.",

Dealing with the set-up, execution and fall-out after a diamond-store safe-break in '50s Paris, it may sound conventional, but with a virtuoso near half-hour - the heist itself - playing out with no dialogue or score in near silence, it's anything but. Dassin's noir is an interesting amalgam of the zeal of American films, and the patience of French cinema. It's quiet, clever and wry in a way that 99.9% of American films have never managed to muster. Perhaps it was these dueling influences, but Rififi (French slang for a burly gentleman's show of force) Ushered in an era of elaborately scripted, shiny on the outside/rotten on the inside noirs that, for many, is still the ultimate in hyper stylish gloom.",

While initially this French film seems to mimick standard American production, it soon becomes clear that Rififi dared more with added grit and violence. In many way, this was the work many robbery films mimicked for a long time. The film also has one of the most intense scenes ever filmed, the silent, gripping and suspenseful execution of the robbery itself, that is nothing short of praiseworthy.It also defied language barriers this film also became a worldwide success.",

After nearly 60 years, Rififi doesn't feel like it's aged a day (other than the fact that security systems are a great deal more complicated now).  The cast here is perfect, led by the incredibly charismatic (and Humphrey Bogart-esque in some way) Jean Servais.   The was my first exposure to the works of Jules Dassin (Best Director winner at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival), and this film really shows just how incredible a director he was.  The actual heist scene that the film is centered around might be the most tense scene ever captured on film.  I found myself literally holding my breath at times.  The use of sound (or lack thereof) during that scene was particularly effective, adding a great deal to the atmosphere and lets the audience know that one wrong move could spell the end for these four men.  Rififi is a film that I feel every fan of films should see at some point during their lives.  It's an excruciatingly tense, perfectly paced crime film, and one I'll be revisiting over and over for the rest of my life.  9.5/10",

The leader Tony (Jean Servais), who initially did not want to take part in the scheme, has just been released from prison and took out part of his madness on an ex by beating her after she went off to be with someone else. Before they rob the store, the crew of four meticulously plan the heist by using an alarm that would be associated with the protection of the jewels in the store, which includes analyzing its sensitivity as well as its location to where they would enter the building. As such, they eventually conduct their plan, but the end result is anything but satisfying (even if they had successfully obtained the loot).  During the same era, two other heists film was released from France: \"Touchez Pas au Grisbi\" (1954) and \"Bob the Gambler\" (1955). Neither film comes close to the greatness of this movie, not nearly obtaining the same level of suspense, storyline quality, nor stage presence of the actors that \"Rififi\" unleashes to the viewers. The heist, which is pretty much the mid-point of the movie, spawns an ending hour that is completely unforgettable. For the time released, the deaths depicted within are graphic and shocking.

It all goes well, but like in all heist movies, everybody ends up getting greedy, involving killing and theft. Who will be the last one standing? \"Rififi\" is widely considered THE BEST heist film, as well as being a highlight in the foreign movie genre. I love Italian movies, so I guess I can say I was nervous to see a French one. This film was in my favorite movie guide \"501 Must-See Movies\", and with my trust in the book, I knew this one had to be good. Was I surprised that I loved it? Heck no. Jules Dassin is a director I know is reliable, and this could possibly be his best film. He not only does a great job acting in a leading role, but every moment that he directs is tense and scary. And that 30- minute heist scene in silence? Need I say more? I found a very good reason to see this is Jean Servais' performance. Usually it's pretty hard to tell if a foreign actor is good or not, but every time he even speaks, I feel like I'm in the presence in one of the most evil men who ever lived. Just seeing this one proved that there are actually actors that are just as good as Marcello Mastroianni.

This part of the film, while interesting, brutal, and suspenseful. Just didn't make my heart almost stop like the heist itself.

He turns around and makes one of the best film noir caper movies ever made.  Yes, even better than the master, Jean Pierre Melville.  Dassin made this classic with a bare bones budget.\n\nThis film is always compared to Huston's \"Asphalt Jungle\", Kubricks, \"The Killing\", and Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\".  But, Rififi is a movie that you must see if you like film noir.  America may have invented film noir, but the French definitely perfected it and made it their own.  There have been talks of a Hollywood remake of this with Al Pacino, but so far, it hasn't come to pass.\n\nTony le St\u00e9phanois (Jean Servais) is down in the dumps having just got out after a five year stint in prison.  His girlfriend, Mado les Grands (Marie Sabouret) is now shacked up with a nightclub owner, Louis le Tatou\u00e9 (Pierre Grasset), which aggravates him even more.  So, Tony takes up the offer to go in on a jewelry heist with his old pals, Jo le Suedois (Carl M\u00f6hner) and Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel).  \n\nInstead of a penny-anti snatch and grab, Tony suggests going all out and breaking into the Jewelry store's safe.  Mario calls in a fellow Italian safe cracker, Cesar le Milanais (Jules Dassin) to join the team, and together, they plan the perfect heist.  \n\nBut, as we all know; crime doesn't pay!  Ladies-man, Cesar gives a stolen diamond ring to one of Louis's nightclub singers and it gets back to him.  Louis captures Cesar and he tells him the accomplices.  In an underhanded knock at ex-colleague, Edward Dmytryk, in Dassin's movie, Tony shoots Cesar for being a rat.\n\nTony tries to make everything right, but...",

            "content": "Nobody does noir like the French.  They invented it, and although American and Japanese directors have made exceptional entries in the genre, the French still do it best.  For evidence, I present exhibit A, Rififi, one of the greatest gangster/heist movies ever made. \r\nAging gangster Tony, just out of prison, gathers his friends for one last job; cracking the safe at Paris's finest jeweler.  It will be the most ambitious job of their careers, with an incredible payoff.  And it doesn't end with the heist either.  When rival gangster Pierre realizes what they've done and decides he wants in, everything they've accomplished is put in jeopardy. \r\nRififi doesn't waste much time establishing the characters or the setup.  Back-story isn't a major concern here.  Each man has his own life and personality, but the important thing is that when it comes to business, Tony, Jo, Mario and Caesar are dead serious.  They know the rules, and the stakes, and are the absolute best at what they do. Their preparations are complex and painstaking.  Casing the joint, memorizing the opening times of the surrounding businesses, finding a way to defeat the alarm system, all are done with the utmost care.\r\nAll of this leads up to one of the tensest scenes in all cinema; the heist itself.  Over half an hour, with no music or dialogue, only the (very quiet) sounds of the men at work.  And what work it is.  Watching these four men chisel their way through the roof, disable the alarm, and crack the safe is like watching Michelangelo sculpt or Arnold Palmer play a round of golf.  It is pure precision, with no margin for even the slightest error.  And what creativity they bring to their trade!  I have never seen such ingenious uses for a tube of caulk or an umbrella.\r\nMost films would have difficulty going this long without sound, but here the silence is an asset.  The lack of sound underscores the fact that their work relies on near-total silence.  Because there is no music or other background noise, we are keenly aware of every clink of the hammer, every rattle of loose concrete, and the fall of every footstep. The silence creates tension more effectively than any ominous music could.  And all the while the clock is, quite literally, ticking.  Time itself is their enemy. \r\nIf Rififi ended with the successful conclusion of their daring burglary, it would be a very good movie.  But it does not satisfy itself with a simple happy ending.  As in so many of the best noirs, the second half tells how the best plans go awry, and everything begins to fall apart.  A minor act of carelessness makes them targets of the most ruthless crime boss in Paris.  The body count rises alarmingly, and the bad guys soon gain what is arguably the ultimate leverage.\r\nThe last act is a masterwork or growing tension, sudden reversals, and hard decisions.  And the final scene, which I will not give away, is probably the best of all.  The pounding, ominous music, the rapid series of cuts, and the gravity of the situation contrast with the innocence of a young child in a way that is simply incredible.  Rififi is fully equal- and perhaps superior to- Chinatown, The Big Heat, or Le Samourai.  If you are a fan of classic noir, I highly urge to see this film.",

Sure, this one scene in the movie is about four minutes long and serves as the only time the title of the movie comes into play but it was enough to make a believer out of me.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been called the ultimate heist movie and that is actually a pretty fair moniker to crown this with being that everyone always goes right into the ultimate scene in this: the 33-minute robbery scene done in almost complete silence.  It really makes you wonder why more crooks didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care more after watching this team of bit-time criminals carry off the break of a lifetime (involving a rope ladder, an umbrella, a fire extinguisher and more).  Nonetheless there is no \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect crime\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t long before the third act starts up and our team of thieves starts meeting the business end of other people who want what they took.  Dassin makes his players behave in ways that are not uncommon (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve participated in a two-story break-in but this is at least more realistic than watching someone use a bazooka to blow open a safe vault) and Servais as Tony puts more out through his facial movements and expressions than the rest of the cast in their vocal delivery.  The only negative here is that after the introduction of the players and the grandiosity of the heist, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re left with a final act that seems to want to wrap this whole picture up fast and in as convenient a way as possible.  Thieves are killed, rival thieves with scores to settle are killed, family members are killed and when the whole thing finally comes to a (literally) screeching halt, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel there had to be a better way to go about all of this.  Yeah, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ending that really does make the most sense given the circumstances but I would have preferred to see it extend itself out a bit longer as opposed to a hyperactive exercise in thinning out the cast for the sake of ending the picture.  But even still, this film has been duplicated time and time again but as far as my knowledge goes (which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too far), it has never been bettered.",

            "content": "\"Rififi\" is often considered the landmark film that modernized heist movies, and it shines brilliantly as a suave, sexy crime noir (that happens to be French). There are flashes of expressionism throughout - the tantalizing 'Rififi' nightclub song sequence and the shadowy night shots, but the classic quick-slung dialogue and refined criminal setting really give the movie its stride.\n\nOf course, it would be impossible to review this movie without mentioning the heist - a complex suspense sequence that takes up a full 28 minutes of running time and has no audio other than the slightest tap of a hammer or patter of a footstep. You can hear your own heartbeat race as each new step of their setup is revealed, bringing a new fear that it won't work or they may be discovered. Even though they carry the stride of first-class cons (they break into the jewelry store wearing complete suits), the characters express both confidence and doubt in their maneuvers, making every second of the continuity exhilarating. When it is finally over, you breathe a sigh of relief for these guys.\n\nEven though the heist is the pinnacle of the film, it only takes place halfway through. The second half is a moralist plug that chronicles the downfall of the cons after their perfect crime. Though it has some great scenes and completes the circle of development of each of the characters, it feels like the movie blew off most of its steam by the end. Even though the tension has all but left, there is a strange sense of loss seeing all the characters you cheered for in the first half take their inevitable fall. It's a classic tale, but told with complexity and craft that was completely new for its time, and served as a basis for every other heist-crime movie, from \"Reservoir Dogs\" to \"Ocean's Eleven.\"",

Rififi is known as the inspiration for all \"Heist Movies\" that followed, from Oceans 11 to Cercle Rouge to Inception.\r\n\r\nNo Spoilers:\r\nThe plot is familiar to anyone who has seen more than a handful of movies.  A crew of the greatest burglars, safecrackers and other specialist criminals, is assembled for the \"Big Heist\", which is usually a big enough job that they can all afford to retire.  Of course every heist is going to hit a snag, as this particular one also does, and that's where the intrigue begins.\r\n\r\nDassin uses the familiar elements of film noir to frame this heist story.  The heist itself is easily one of the most famous - and most perfect - scenes ever put on film.  It has been copied so often, both in other films and in real life heists, that it may actually give the viewer deja vu.\r\n\r\nThe acting is pure noir.  The tough guys give each other deadly looks and the women are all femmes fatale.  All the performances are much better in the subtitled French version rather than the badly dubbed English one.\r\n\r\nRififi's only weakness is the Hollywood influenced theme of morality.  It's bad to be a criminal!  Within 5 years, Godard would mock this morality in Breathless.  More recently, like in Tarantino's heist-homage Reservoir Dogs, the question of morality is examined on a much deeper level.  And now Chris Nolan has introduced us to the heist of our own thoughts - just imagine the moral implications of that kind of theft!\r\n\r\nI can safely say this movie would entertain pretty much anybody.  The suspense is masterful, since you just know something has to go wrong, but you don't know what.  Rififi's slightly dated view of right and wrong may seem simplistic by modern standards, but like Inception, the process of the heist itself is more interesting than the motives behind it, and even most of the characters participating in it.",

But well, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRififi\u00e2\u0080\u009d definitely fits into that category, not only for the famously amazing 30-minute heist scene almost devoid of any dialogue (containing the inevitable unrealistic or even totally impossible elements many a heist scene tends to have and which at the same time contribute to the sheer amusement value of the scene \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the heist scene in \u00e2\u0080\u009cRififi\u00e2\u0080\u009d must have served as an example for many more such scenes in French gangster films \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cLe cercle rouge\u00e2\u0080\u009d (1970) and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLe casse\u00e2\u0080\u009d (1971) are only two examples that spring to mind right now). \u00e2\u0080\u009cRififi\u00e2\u0080\u009d has so many more commendable features than just the abovementioned jewellery theft. Take, for instance, the title song so beautifully performed by Magali No\u00c3\u00abl. In a nutshell, it illustrates, in a playful way, the sort of milieu we are faced with in this film: tough gangsters with their women standing on the sideline, in which position they can do little more than accept the risky actions of their men. At the same time, women do play a crucial part in their lives: without them certain scenarios could have been totally different. Thanks to Mado\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention, the innocent can be spared and as a result of Viviane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (Magali No\u00c3\u00abl) mesmerizing effect on Cesar le Milanais (played by the director, Jules Dassin, who is listed in the cast under the name \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerlo Vita\u00e2\u0080\u009d), the film reaches the germ of its turning point. In this respect, Mario Ferrati\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (Robert Manuel) words must be regarded as prophetic: allegedly, there is no safe that can resist Cesar and there are no women Cesar can resist. The heist goes splendidly due to Cesar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technical knowledge of safes, but his crush on Viviane causes the s*** to hit the fan. The doubtful moral of many criminal milieu movies (the gangster group led by Tony le St\u00c3\u00a9phanois (Jean Servais) is supposed to be morally preferable to that of a creep like Pierre Grutter (Marcel Lupovici), but given the actions of both, one tends to wonder why) is put into perspective by the ending (who survives and who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?) and the words of Louise le Suedois (Janine Darcey) spoken to (and about) her husband Jo (Carl M\u00c3\u00b6hner): there were so many poor guys out there who did not turn into crooks, so why did you? A repeated-viewing experience of this movie prompt one to speak volumes of it (watch out for subtle details, like why and when does Grutter allow his younger brother Remi (Robert Hossein) to use drugs), but I had best refrain from that and end by paying the director a compliment about the beautifully filmed final scene (car ride back home with the child) and about \u00e2\u0080\u009cRififi\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a whole.

A lousy title hides the prototype heist noir peopled by dames (though not many), bad guys and worse guys killing and kidnapping in pursuit of a fortune in jewels.  Little known deceased actor Jean Servais plays the anti-hero who dying of tuberculosis after a five year prison stretch decides to get the gang back together for the jewelry haul of a lifetime.  The movie is widely imitated in using a prolonged, intricate, robbery sequence which I find to be the dullest part of these types of films (e.g., the \"Mission:  Impossible\" or \"Ocean's Eleven\" series).  I'm willing to spot the director the conclusion that the robberies are a miracle of planning without the do-it-yourself step by step instructions.  Servais' gang winds up shooting it out with the \"Grutter\" gang with \"Untouchables\"-level brutality who prove to be the worse set of bad guys because of their willingness to kidnap the child of one of the gang.  The double-crosses elevate the level of suspense and Servais' dour, nothing-to-lose demeanor makes for some very dark passages that never rise above the charcoal grays which dominate the cinematography.  The movie is definitely foreign (the gang comes into the apartment of one of the plotters and watches him being bathed by his wife(?)) but gunplay translates easily in any language.  If you are a fan of modern noir heist remakes like \"The Italian Job\" or \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" or their originals incarnations, this is the predecessor of them all.",

Aside from the fact that it was difficult to read the subtitles at times (black and white film with white/gray lettering), this is a top notch film, and I can see why it is regarded as one of the best and most influential heist films. It's also one of the more artful films of its type too, mostly with how it is constructed and executed.\n\nThe plot is pretty standard for this type of film: criminal gets out of jail, gets involved in a lucrative score. All seems perfect, and starts off that way, but thigns fall apart, and all hell breaks loose. Much of this film (either plot or certain elements) has turned up in places such as Heat, Mission: Impossible, and the Ocean's trilogy, among others. Sometimes it is just as homage or reference, other times it seems like theft *cue rimshot*.\n\nThis is just some incredibly thrilling and well done stuff. One sequence that is often mentioned is the film's centerpiece: the heist scene. It is roughly a half hour long, and nearly silent (no talking or music, but some occasional sound). Doing things this way really adds to the atmosphere and builds up the suspense and tension to an almost unbearable level. \n\nThe final portion of the film involves the fallout of the job, and, for its time, some of this must have seemed rather violent and shocking. Nowadays, not so much, but it's still pretty engaging stuff. \n\nA remake of this has been planend for quite some time, and, if it ever gets made, it could be good, but regardless, do yourself a favor and check this one out. It's truly a marvelous and masterful film.",

Tony is very cruel to a former mistress and is definitely capable of committing cold-blooded murder. His character believes in honor even among thieves and his solo acts of vengeance against his godson's kidnappers is what gives this film its punch.\n\nGood noir.",

In it, a group of four thieves plan the perfect heist, but are ultimately betrayed by their passions and impulses. It is a very pessimistic, dark masterpiece.\r\n\r\nJean Servais plays the brooding, lonely main character. He brings the brilliance into the scheme; he's a tortured, experienced criminal who is just out of jail. He is constantly quiet, keeps his motives secret, and conceals with zeal his weak points. Above all, he is the anti hero who redeems himself at the end, if such word as \"redemption\" can apply. He and his French friend, whose son is his godson, and two Italian thieves -one of which is an expert safebox breaker- begin to plan a 20 million Francs robbery at a jewelry store. During the first half of the film, the group is shown in painstaking observation and evaluation of the routine in and an around the store. Finally, the night comes to execute the plan, and this develops into one of the most fascinating, maybe even exquisite, robbery scenes I have ever seen. For many minutes there is hardly a sound, except perhaps that of the rest of the audience in the theater, hearts beating or nervous breathing. It is wonderfully hypnotizing and mortifying, filmed with such precision and style that it immediately produces admiration. I think that to any film lover this will be close to an ecstatic experience.\r\n\r\nTechnical perfection is not the sole, dominant aspect of Rififi. The four main characters are very well outlined and very well acted; Jean Servais is as archtypical a noir leading man as there ever was in American cinema. Together they embody the carelessness of having nothing to lose, the fierceness of wanting to win everything, and the sadness that such emptiness must helplessly imply. There are also the gloomy, atmospheric shots in the streets of Paris to set the mood, and provide background for the twists and turns of the plot. With a clear narrative style, Rififi successfuly incorporates fragmented scenes, composed of angular takes against the sky and roads of Paris, in a way that reminded me very much of later New Wave films.\r\n\r\nIt is not only a thrilling, suspenseful \"action\" film, but Du Rififi Chez les Hommes is also a complex drama and styllistic gem. It has violence, humor, sex, and crimes that do not go unpunished. One of those films that really seem to come full circle and satisfy not only us, but themselves.",

Brilliant performances and beautiful black and white cinematography that achieves the true chiaroscuro effect necessary for great noir blend together with Dassin's expert direction to create a film that rivals the best of the genre.  Riffi, which means rough and tumble according to the lounge song in the film, concerns the inability of criminals and convicts to escape from their lives of crime.  Instead, Rififi follows the classic noir plotline of examining the inevitable destruction to which criminal life leads.  But it is also about the forces of fate or evironment or society that drive us to our tragic destinies, the fates we can't escape once we have made our choices, and the tragedy that can occur even when we try to do good.",
