The overt racism, which I realize both Ford and Wayne were against, is grating in today's context. Also, the dialogue is rather unremarkable in my view and the acting is very broad and hammy, although this is probably a function of that era of old Hollywood. The humorous elements of the subplot are broad and corny, and they are a drag on the main story. So while I appreciate the film visually, which is easy because there are stunning landscapes here and great shots galore, overall I did not enjoy it.",

Its quite a shout-y film, so if that doesn't appeal then perhaps its best to give this a miss. There are lots of scenes involving male characters fighting with one another, trying to prove each other the better one - that sort of thing. Of course im aware of the, how shall I put it?, non-PCness of such films and I did cringe at scenes where scalps were shown and the idea of the brutal savagery of supposed indians (native Americans) but I can also see that this film may be appreciated as an example of a classic American western too. There were one or two mildly amusing moments present too (such as one when a cowboy is bent over, having to get someone to pull sharp items out of his behind 'did that hurt?' 'no! shutup boy...' that sort of thing).\n\nIts definitely cheesy but its not an awful film - its not great, its relatively good, I'd say. I think I enjoyed more than I disliked it, so I'd recommend it on that basis, yes.",

Against the backdrop of this beautiful and yet harsh landscape, he establishes a story that haunts us with its depiction of hate-driven obsession and a foreboding sense of ambiguity underlying the real purpose behind the exhaustive search. We are both stunned and sickened by the Ethan character's depraved impulses (masterfully portrayed by John Wayne,) yet the film's acclaimed final passage transcends both of the aforementioned qualities: it reveals a man we don't fully understand, leaving us tempted to pity him. Such striking qualities justifiably earn \"The Searchers\" the highest praise, yet I must attest that it is not my favorite Western by Ford. At times, it feels uneven, and we regret certain compensatory comic details which undermine the seriousness of the film's theme. Regardless of these imperfections, I still return to \"The Searchers\" time and again, relishing each moment of the emotionally and morally complex story that so boldly defies the general conventions of orthodox film-making.",

To explain this I'm going to focus on how he shows us that [SPOILER ALERT] \n\n... Ethan and Martha were lovers and Ethan is the father of the youngest daughter Debbie.\n1  The loving gentleness of the kiss between Ethan and Martha in the opening scene\n2 Debbie looks so different from her two older siblings\n3 The immediate attraction between Debbie and Ethan\n4 Ethan stands Debbie in the table so their heads are nearly touching - don't they look like each other!\n5 The way Martha caresses Ethan's coat after picking off a piece of fluff before giving it back to him in the morning.\n6 On leaving the breakfast table Debbie asks and lets Ethan remove her apron\n7 The distracted way Martha looks after Ethan when he leaves with the Texas rangers\n8 Guess who we see having walked out to see them off: Martha and Debbie\n9 When they realise the Comanche's trick Ethan stares out over his horse in obvious emotional distress.\n10. When Ethan returns to the burnt out homestead which name does he call out first - his brother or his sister-in-law? It's Martha of course.\n11 Aaron (unknowingly?) asks Ethan why he didn't \"clear out\" before the war in a time of hardship.\n\nThat's not to say Aaron and Martha's marriage was a bad marriage. They clearly understand each other well. This is beautifully shown when Aaron goes out to try to \"pot a few sage hens\" after he hears something and suspects the Comanche raiders. He takes his shotgun and then grabs a pistol out of it's gun-belt hung by the door. Why does he need a pistol as well to shoot sage hens? Martha spots this of course. No words pass between them when he returns and the tension is only broken when the older daughter, Lucy, brings a lamp to the table.\n\nSo why not 5 stars? Not because of Ethan's racism which is out of sympathy with the film - but the battle scenes don't work too well for me. It's odd that a director known for his westerns here excels in the personal relationships of this family The first half hour (and that marvellous opening scene) are the peak of this wonderful film.",

            "content": "Another box ticked. I'd never seen The Searchers before, and it's regarded in many circles as being the best film ever made, at the very least, the best western. I would agree with neither of these statements (the former is a stupid claim to make of any film really) but there's no doubt John Ford's tour de force is one of the most important documents in Western genre history. After his brother's family is slaughtered by a group of Comanches shortly after his return home from war, Ethan (John Wayne) sets off in pursuit after discovering that two of his nieces are alive and being held captive by the Comanches. The phrase 'sweeping epic' seems to be one frequently attributed to The Searchers, and although sweeping is impossible to argue with, I do take slight issue with epic. The film is 'only' two hours long (a film should take as long as it needs) but there are a few very swift scenes that feel inserted simply to show us a different season, or indeed one shot of a few seconds that represents a few years. It's an entirely personal preference of course, and I'll be interested to know whether that feeling changes on multiple viewings, but it was hard to fully accept the length of the story when held against the length of the film. This is a minor quibble though. John Wayne is an absolute bastard of a man as Ethan, he doesn't take any shit from anyone and imposes himself on other characters so swiftly that you fully believe in his character. I'm not well versed in Wayne westerns, but this is a man that looks incredibly at home on the plains of the Old West, and I look forward to exploring his work further. I also have no idea how the BBFC have awarded this film a U certificate; not only is the film harrowing, it's genuinely tense, menacing, and scary in places. And above all, it's also bloody good too (although not in the gore sense of the word).",

            "content": "The Searchers occupies a unique and extremely complicated place in the history of cinema. On the one hand it is undoubtedly one of the greatest and most important films ever made, in both the western genre and in cinema as a whole, and is perhaps the magnum opus of both director John Ford and star John Wayne. On the other hand, parts of it have definitely not aged well, and though it attempts to deal with race in ways that were definitely uncommon for both the era and the genre, certain elements remain somewhat problematic for modern viewers. \n\nThe story revolves around John Wayne's character, the ex-Confederate Ethan Edwards and his search for his niece Debbie, kidnapped by Comanche warriors on a raid on the homestead of Ethan's brother's family. During the ensuing five years, accompanied by Martin Pawley, Debbie's adoptive brother, Ethan pursues the Comanche band and their war chief, Scar, in hopes of finding his beloved niece. \n\nThe film is masterfully shot, a relic of a bygone era in filmmaking where directors both knew how to use natural landscapes as a canvas, as well as how to say more by showing less (the scene where Ethan finds the mutilated body of his sister-in-law, in which we never see the corpse but we do see Ethan's reaction, is one of the most haunting and powerful in all of cinema). John Wayne also delivers the performance of his career as Ethan Edwards, a hard, complicated man, driven by both his love for his niece (and for his late sister-in-law) as well as his hatred for Native Americans. \n\nBy the mid 1950s views were beginning to change in the United States regarding race and ethnicity, and John Ford, in a somewhat stumbling but nonetheless sincere way, attempted to present Native American characters in a more complex and even sympathetic light than in his earlier westerns, where Whites were the \"good guys\" and Native Americans were portrayed as the uncouth savage hordes. We see, for example, that Scar has a genuine motivation for hating and taking vengeance on White settlers, bringing a depth to the villain that wouldn't have been found in a similar character in, say, Stagecoach (1939). Images of women and children being attacked in the final assault on the Comanche camp at the end of the film also bring a sense of humanity to the Natives, showing that there are innocent casualties on both sides, not just those of the settlers. And Ethan himself, despite being the protagonist, is a completely non-sympathetic character, and we are never really encouraged to root for him despite his ostensibly good intentions. \n\nHowever, despite these attempts at showing Native Americans in a different light, certain elements still have not aged well. Among these is the casting of White actor Henry Brandon as the war chief Scar, a common decision at the time, but one that seems somewhat jarring given that actual Natives were cast in the film. Another is the sequence where Martin inadvertently takes himself a Squaw, who is presented as comic relief in a thoroughly unnecessary slapstick scene. \n\nFrom a non-racial perspective, the romantic subplot between Martin and love interest Laurie Jorgensen, though not detracting from the overall plot, are definitely the lower points of the film, and though intended as comic relief in a very serious story, provide a little *too* much humor. \n\nHowever, these flaws, numerous though they may be, do not detract from the film's status as a classic. Perhaps it is *because* of these flaws that the film is as memorable as it is, and has become regarded as one of the cornerstones of cinema. The Searchers is a gripping, breathtaking, and indeed thought-provoking masterpiece that is essential for any movie lover.",

Ford directs a slow, dull affair at 119 minutes. Jack Murray, the editor, could have cut this down an entire hour, and he wouldn't have lost much. The Searchers is not the classic Western picture, nor the filmmaking gem of John Ford's career, that diehard Western fans hail it as such. Both John Ford and John Wayne made greater films before and after The Searchers. It's easily skippable. I recommend John Ford's Stagecoach or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. John Wayne was better in Stagecoach, Red River, and Liberty Valance.\n\nJohn Wayne taking his hateful vengeance out on anyone that crosses can be exciting, but only to leave the girl he was looking for for 5 whole years! It's absurd that we are supposed to excuse all the repulsive hate and disdain for Native Americans, women, and The North just because Ford directs The Searchers to be really about how pointless Wayne's racism and hatred is as he must learn to love his niece again and accept her as still his family.\n\nFrom wasting Natalie Wood for about 30 seconds of screen time to putting her in brownface yet again like in West Side Story, it's just awful to see. Ford has blatantly racist and sexist characters, sometimes played for crude laughs, otherwise meant to belittle women and minorities. The Searchers is a truly ugly film despite Winston C. Hoch's gorgeous wide shot cinematography with a few choice close-ups on John Wayne glaring at something.\n\nJohn Wayne is one of the few redeeming aspects of The Searchers with his tough guy star power, but he is barely acting. His raging madman is ruthlessly violence, ceaselessly vindictive, cruelly racist, casually sexist with killer gunfighting and some strong one liners. His character is vile, but Wayne plays him well enough. It's a disgusting role that Wayne sells off the strength of his hard hitting one liners and fast shooting. However, even he looks bored half the time.\n\nMax Steiner's score sounds so saccharine that it is ridiculous. The Searchers has this ultra serious tone, then suddenly shifts into a farcical comedy at the awkward ending wedding sequence after all the former pain filled scenes. Then, The Searchers ends on a sobering note, after awful comedy for some tasteless directing choices from John Ford. \n\nFrank S. Nugent and Alan Le May's script is so flawed, I don't know where to start. From the incessantly violent Natives given no sympathy to the one note female characters serving as side notes to their male counterparts, The Searchers feels so underwritten. The main plot of seeking to save a kidnapped child could have been effective, if they stuck with it, but the halfbaked comedy, gross racism, casual sexism, and stupid dialogue throughout ruin the idea of Wayne's character really hunting Natives for his own hateful satisfaction rather than rescuing his niece. I mean, why even have Vera Miles in The Searchers if she's only in around 2 or 3 scenes? Jeffrey Hunter is so bad at acting that he makes John Wayne seem like Lee Van Cleef.\n\nCharles Arrico's costumes are awful. The Native American outfits all look like cheap stereotypes, and John Wayne's pants are hideous. His shirts look so awkward on him, that it's laugh out loud funny. Web Overlander and Jack Obringer's make-up gives everyone an ugly sweaty look, not to mention all the brownface make-up on half the cast. Just terrible work all around.\n\nIn short, I cannot say that I'd recommend The Searchers. Check out nearly any other Western, John Ford film, or John Wayne movie instead for a deeper piece of Americana and certainly a more entertaining watch.",

Most of the secondary cast are way over the top and, while John Wayne is fine, he is basically playing the same role he has played countless times previously and adds no new dimensions to the role of the protagonist, Ethan Edwards.

The film lacks compassion or empathy of any sort, instead relying on old world machismo and racism to tap into the testosterone-driven emotion of young aspiring cowboys. The main set of characters strengthen themselves through self-victimization. Like whiny black films about people of color at the mercy of victimizers, this is a whiny white film about pillaging frontiersmen endangered by natives, who, according to 'heroic' John Wayne, aren't American! The film is too full of senseless contradictions and hypocrisy to stand the test of time, and is nothing more than an archaic relic with gorgeous technical achievements. \n\nThe film almost becomes interesting at the 90-minute mark when Natalie Wood is revealed as a Comanche serving scalps. There's an attempt to see through the eyes of the villains as Scar declares that he kills whites for each of his sons they took. But this setup does not have much of a payoff. John Wayne's toxic masculinity is the only narrative thread anyone is interested in. We never get more of Scar's side of the story, he becomes pure villain again, and Natalie Wood devolves into a weak, nearly purposeless melodrama with her damsel in distress rescue. \n\nMelodrama is the key word here; the acting is so bad, it's degrading to everyone involved, whites and Natives. I wish I could say there was clever, layered phoniness, like you'd get in a Lynch or even Leone film, but there's nothing of the sort. Ford is playing this as a very literal propaganda that intends to awaken the inner frontiersmen to rise from his seat and annex the nearest plot of land. The drama is in false victimhood, and the comedy is silly antics with no further depth.",

You can see and feel his angst, his sadness, his burning hatred, his resolve - all through just his eyes and expression.

This movie is about the virtues and defaults of people. Not about white people killing and destroying \"wild\" Indians. \"The Searchers\" is actually tragic poetry and, needless to say, a landmark in movie history. A dark view of American \"civilization\". Indians are sauvage because they have been thrown out of their land. White people fight for what they think it belongs to them thus being also sauvage and violent. Themes about Indians' xenophobic nature are poorly understood by today's audiences (as a Mexican studying those subjects in a country more indigenous than the United States, I must say that I am aware of that). I agree that these subjects as treated in the movie might seem quite disturbing at times, but those were other days, and Ford's masterpiece should be acknowledged for its contributions to the characters' development in film, the breathtaking landscapes and the effective storytelling. Instead of being judged by modern audiences' sensibility and close-minded attitudes. At the end, Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) finds the humanity he lacked of. That is why I do not buy those Millenial reactions and points of view. The movie is a milestone!",

There is actually a degree of complexity to the protagonist, no longer the prototypical hero but instead a cynical outcast-type who is not always capable of superhero-esque feats that his role might have warranted in lesser productions. Many of the wide shots of the barren desert are great, a signature Ford move. Still, the tone is often inconsistent and strange, and the story diverges in bizarre direction that aren't always relevant or explored enough to justify themselves. Special shoutout to the strangest outfit that Wayne has ever worn; preparing to meet with his sworn enemy after searching for years, murderer of several family members, he strolls into a Mexican cantina with a massively oversized white hat, blue jeans with rolled-up cuffs, and a plaid shirt so bright it might be considered bioluminescent. It clashes with the atmosphere so fantastically it might just make you laugh out loud. (4/5)",

Modern mindsets have imposed meanings and depth to things here that were never intended by Ford and Wayne. If Ethan Edwards is such a blind racist, why is the tone in everything he does sympathetic and even humorous? We are never meant to have anything but a positive view about the John Wayne \u2018hero\u2019, and if he does cross the line, well, its OK, he\u2019s a flawed hero...still a hero. Wayne recites his lines and does his usual bit. This would have been truly interesting with a brave and real actor like Richard Widmark. The subplots of the good ol\u2019 white folks on the homestead are boring and should have been cut. So many Ford touches are rehashes of what we\u2019ve seen over and over. How many times do we need to hear John Qualen use his Swedish accent saying \u2018yumpin\u2019 yiminy\u2019? I can understand why it was only a modest success back in \u201856. And the famous last shot only means Ethan can\u2019t enter the home and new attitude towards race if you really force it. In reality, Wayne and Ford simply saved a white girl from the bad Injuns, his job was done, and he moved on. Ok yes, its Ford so its beautifully shot, and has some touching moments.

            "content": "(SPOILERS) In my opinion, \"The Searchers\" is the greatest Western ever made. However, I think much of the critical praise that this film rightly deserves is wrongly founded. While it does depict the racism that lives inside Ethan Edwards, it doesn't either promote or condemn his racism. A lot of people refer to the ending of the film as proof that Ethan realizes that he has a lot of redemption ahead of him, so he doesn't enter his family's house because he believes that he himself is a disgrace. While it is true that he has a change of heart late in the film in deciding to bring Debbie home instead of killing her as he originally intended, I believe this change of heart was more a move of compassion towards his own niece as opposed to a move of turning back against his own prejudice. Debbie, despite having assimilated with her Comanche captors and referring to them as \"her people,\" she is still white, and she lets Ethan take her back to her family after the battle at the end. When she is returned to her family, Ethan remains outside of the house. Many viewers and critics believe that he doesn't enter because he feels shame. However, director John Ford did not intend it this way. I agree with the assessment of the film by Kyle Smith of the National Review -- he doesn't remain outside the house because he feels shame. Rather, he remains outside the house because, as Smith puts it, his job is done and he is no longer needed there. Smith says to close out his article, \"His next step will be another adventure, not atonement.\" Still, Ethan is one of the greatest American characters in film in terms of the depth and dimensions of his character. Plot and characters aside, the cinematography is spectacular. The landscapes are grand and accurately capture frontier life in the 19th century. It really makes you feel like you're there at that place and that time. Everything else about the film is also top-notch. In my opinion, \"The Searchers\" is the definitive Western. Everyone should watch it, and I think it's a shame that so few Americans have heard of it, let alone seen it.",

Monument Valley is an arrid environment between Utah and Arizona.\nJohn Wayne commented that his collaborations with Ford were quite literally like living in the western era. It must have been a logistical nightmare shooting big budget productions in such locations!\nFor years I assumed that the premise of the film was John Wayne's character (Ethan Edwards) 'searching' for a close relative Debbie (Natalie Wood).\nThat is partly true but on watching the film has other elements such as the old fashioned  (inertly racist) attitudes of Ethan.\nEthan wants to murder Debbie it transpires not simply rescue her as he believes she has some kind of Stockholm syndrome brainwashing from her Comanche Indian captors. The search does take place over five years.\nThe film has gone on to influence so many other great filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese. The character of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) in Taxi Driver perhaps?\nThe film also employs some comedic moments to lower the tone of the serious racist messages explored.\nThe supporting cast are great in some of these sequences.\nI can now understand why this film is rated so highly after all these years as perhaps the ultimate John Wayne film after Stagecoach.",

            "content": "The structure of the plot in The Searchers is a powerful one. You feel the slow march of time as these two men search in vain for years. The devotion and dedication of their quest is commendable, and makes them into almost mythical characters by the end of the film. It\u2019s amazing to me that John Ford is capable of simultaneously making a movie that isn\u2019t slow or boring, and also one that allows me to feel the passage of so much time. There is some humor blended in among the serious drama, and I don\u2019t always feel that it works. Thankfully, It is never so prevalent that humor undermines the seriousness of the plot. I love the iconic way that The Searchers concludes and how things are resolved. While it is possibly a bit too good to be true based on what was established before, I don\u2019t care because the end feels too good to nitpick even in a small way. The story has a wonderful arc and it\u2019s nice to see how it changes each character. I think my only genuine complaint of any significance in The Searchers is John Wayne. While he\u2019s not a total blank slate, he lacks the personality and expressiveness to drive such an emotional plot. His line delivery is almost always flat and only on rare occasions do I see genuine range in his performance. Wayne is not the worst actor I\u2019ve seen, but I can\u2019t help thinking how much more this movie could be elevated by an actor with more charisma. Despite my reservations about Wayne, I still was impressed with everything that The Searchers delivered. It\u2019s a very solid film. ",

            "content": "I first saw this film, following an introduction by the late great Barry Norman, who described it as, 'the finest Western ever made'. Being a lover of the more modern Westerns by directors such as Leone and Peckinpah, I took this statement as a challenge, how could a film made in 1956 possibly compare with my favourites ?  Then I watched the movie, engrossed from the first scene to the iconic finale and I had to agree that The Searchers was indeed the finest Western I had ever seen.\n\nThe vistas were incredible, many of the shots framed by director John Ford looked like oil paintings brought to life, straight from the canvas to the big screen. I was surprised to see the violence of the frontier presented in such a frank and uncompromising fashion. In several key scenes the suggestion of the horrors just out of frame proved the old adage that less is definitely more. In other the words the mind's eye can paint far darker pictures than anything that can be put upon the screen. For a film made in 1956 I was impressed by the unusually balanced way in which the film deals with the conflict between the settlers and the Commanche, the brutality of both sides typified by the fury of Edwards and Scar. I had never seen John Wayne play such an interesting character before, never having been a fan of his more usual bombastic screen persona. Here he plays a tough ruthless individual, a bigot and a racist fuelled by a hatred matched only by his rival Scar. I was delighted to find the heart of the movie, and in my opinion the real hero, was neither white nor native, but the part Cherokee orphan Martin Pawley, brilliantly portrayed by Jeffrey Hunter. It's his character that wears down the gruff, uncompromising Edwards with his steadfast determination and compassion forcing the older man to recognise the error of his ways or at least soften them enough to make his part redemption believable.\n\nAs the door closed on that iconic finale a whole new era of cinema was opened up to me and I was forced to challenge my own prejudices. No longer would I dismiss a film based upon my pre-conceived notions of the cast or production date. Even to this day The Searchers remains my favourite film, indeed only the magnificent Unforgiven comes close, but even more importantly it opened up decades of cinema I had previously dismissed out of hand. If not for the brilliance of Ford I would never have discovered classics such as Casablanca, Vertigo or Citizen Kane. Will there ever be a Western to surpass The Searchers - 'That'll be the day !'",

The film's comic relief is welcome between depictions of characters' harsh racist attitudes. John Wayne's performance in The Searchers is astounding: he embodies everything flawed about human nature, from prejudice to desire for violence. The Searchers is a film that makes you think.

Jacqueline Voorhees from 'Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt' is politically correct by comparison.\nEthan's acts of revenge are horrific- savage, even, and it's meant to make us feel uncomfortable, but he never considers his actions, never realizes the effect of white violence on Native Americans, only realizes his own \"whiteness\" that he needs to bring his niece back home, and the film peters out afterwards. \nI can't entirely hate 'The Searchers'.

            "content": "This John Ford directed classic is one of the better Westerns in film history that went on to influence many films within the wider reaches of the genre through the 60's, 70's and beyond. The film follows legendary Western actor John Wayne as Ethan Edwards, an ex confederate soldier who returns to visit his brother Aaron and his family in their ranch. Ethan and Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) venture out to protect the land from Comanches but when they return they find the ranch burnt to the ground with Aaron and his wife dead and their two daughters taken hostage. The narrative then kicks in when Ethan gathers a group of 'searchers' to hunt down the Indian tribe and recover the lost girls. This film really does have it all, the plot is gripping and takes entertaining turns throughout, the dialogue is expertly crafted with so much meaning behind many lines that build character and more, there is some well integrated humour injected here and there, and the cinematography is sweeping with just beautiful scenery. \n\nOne of the biggest highlights of the film is not only the performance by John Wayne but the way it handles his character being a Western protagonist who isn't necessarily a \"hero\" of sorts. There are many things he says and does at key moments over the course of the film that establish him as being someone who isn't a white collar, save the day good guy..... it helps to blur the lines between good and bad and gets you thinking. So much of this movie depended on the viewer not necessarily liking Ethan but rather responding to him and his behaviour. And he was a very engaging character with some great meaningful dialogue and an arc that may or may not be resolved by the closing scene but it is a damn interesting one. \n\nOne thing i occasionally touch on in some reviews but don't ever really comment on is in fact mis-en-scene, but here, especially for a film as influential as this one you can't not talk about it. Every detail in every shot in this film feels so meticulously planned out by John Ford that just watching a scene as simple as people moving about a house is just as impressive and stunning as an outdoor sweeping shot of a beautiful vista. There is so much detail to pick out of every scene in every set that it all just adds to the authenticity of what you are watching possibly maybe being real... One recurring shot choice throughout the film that it opens and closes with is a camera directed out the door of a house looking out into the immediate and distant environment and typically framing a particular character or characters. This iconic doorway shot choice is flawlessly pristine and it sets up location and context and character in a very artistic manner that you can't help but admire. The use of this 'doorway camera' in the film is greatly executed forever tied to the success of this film. \n\nSo in the end, looking past the fact that this movie is in some ways pretty racist it is still beautifully shot, extremely well directed, features great dialogue, and develops an engaging and entertaining story very well. It paved the way influencing many films to come throughout the 70's, and not only the Western genre, Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' (1976) also takes inspiration from the John Ford classic. \n\n9.1/10",

The treatment of Native Americans is stereotypical, and they're shown to be inept, silly, and savage.  Actions are routinely illogical and the attempts at comedy tossed in are poor.  The story of Wayne's search for his kidnapped niece is straightforward, but the film gets painfully side-tracked with a love story and other goofiness.\n\nThe only reason to watch this film is the cinematography.  Director John Ford captures several absolutely gorgeous and iconic shots in Monument Valley, though he too often relies on the same rock formations in the background, stunning as they are.   The scenes in deep snow and crossing an icy river are also fantastic, though it's odd how quickly we see shifts from arid desert to winter.   Regardless, these are the ONLY good things about this movie.\n\nThere are so many other things to hate.  Wayne's mispronunciation of Comanche as \"Commanch\", his disparaging half-breeds, and his disdain for clearly traumatized women who were forced to live with Native Americans for years (Texas Ranger: \"It's hard to believe they're white\".   Wayne: \"They're not white anymore.\").   A blue-eyed Indian chief.   The ridiculously accurate shooting.   Wayne inexplicably thinking of shooting his niece when he finds her, since she doesn't want to return with him, despite years of searching for her.  (Oh wait, that is explainable; he's racist and she's now \"one of them\").  Lastly, I almost threw up in my mouth when Wayne sauntered off at the end.  Perhaps that was triggered while also thinking of his real-life comments in a 1971 interview with Playboy Magazine:\n\nPLAYBOY: For years American Indians have played an important - if subordinate - role in your Westerns. Do you feel any empathy with them?\n\nWAYNE: I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them, if that's what you're asking. Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.\n\nUgh.",

John Ford shows us how Western is done by it's breathtaking landscapes, haunting scenes and the best ending to a film I've ever seen.\n\nJohn Wayne gives the performance of his career as Ethan and I don't think his other performances can top that, but then again, my mind might change. John Wayne is the soul of Western and I don't care what anyone says to change that. He's so iconic that even people who haven't seen his movies still know the famous cow boy image of John Wayne.\n\nBut I've heard a lot of issues from people with the character of Ethan. People thought the character was racist, unlikable or just a prick. Well his mother was killed by comanches, he lost the woman he loved to his brother, he fought in a war where he would have seen many people, including his friends killed, and then he returns home to his family who are massacred, including the woman he loves who was also raped. He also finds his niece's raped corpse that he buries.\n\nI don't think Ethan was suppose to win your heart. He's a deeply troubled and sometimes bordering on psychotic, person. He's an anti-hero that I couldn't bring myself to hate but root for. He's a racist and I'm okay with that, because it gives the character Ethan an interesting conflict with Martin (played by Jeffrey Hunter), for being quarter Cherokee which Ethan hates. It's never clear if Ethan views change at the end, but it sure makes one hell of a partnership between the two.\n\nThis movie dose not mess around when it comes to it's violence. And no, I don't mean it's gory or bloody, but the movie gets quite dark at times. I only say \"at times\" because there is a fair share of humor in this that I did laugh at, as it fitted perfectly with the story and wasn't force. That's what I love about this movie. It manages to balance humor and dark scenes so brilliantly that's it's really difficult to pull off in movies. For a Western that's aged approved, it sure has some balls of what it presents you.\n\nI gotta be honest here. This is the first John Wayne movie I've ever watched and I can't believe it took me this long to get around to this one. First it was Marilyn, then Dean and now Wayne. Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini and Akira Kurosawa movies I still need to see.\n\nDon't worry Letterboxd people,\n\n\"That'll be the day\".",

Several times through the movie large periods of time go by and left me thinking \"What on earth is even going on now? What happened to the past two years?\".

            "content": "Rich, resonant, mature Western film. Definitely earns a place within my top ten favourite Western films and my top ten favourite '50s films. And it's undoubtedly my favourite film as far as making use of my favourite natural film location EVER goes. Monument Valley is the inarguable star of the this beautiful, wonderfully lensed film. From a narrative point of view, I'm not sure why there are farms in that red desert, but that logic aside - exterior location filming never looked so good - then or since. Red rock desert, startling blue sky. Many, many single shots in this film you could hang on your wall as a print. Not just Monument Valley though. I adore the wintery shots of the buffalo herd, or Ethan and Martin's horses ploughing through the deepest snow, or the Calvary changing through the icy river. Visually this film is a masterclass that has been homage so many times since (notably within my favourite film franchise).\n\nBut the film is so much more than visual splendour. It sits right on the cusp of the traditional \"cowboys and Indians\"/good vs evil golden era westerns and the revisionist, multi-layered westerns that took over from the 60s onwards. A casual viewer might view Ethan as a typical white-hatted hero, and the Indians as pure savages...yet if you pay more attention to this...Ethan is definitely a conflicted anti-hero, torn up inside by the loss of his family and the need to vilify the native American population that his predecessors have \"conquered\". He's not just a good guy or a bad guy. He's a CHARACTER. He's racist as hell, but I don't think the film is excusing that. He's true the country and era of the time. He doesn't really believe in his \"country\" after the war. He loves his family, and is obsessed with wreaking vengeance on the people who took most of them (perhaps all of them) away from him in an incredibly brutal and savage fashion. Martin is a simpler, purer character (he not an eye-for-an-eye type, he just wants his step-sister back), but serves as a counterpoint to Ethan in much the same way Montgomery Cliff was a counterpoint to John Wayne is Red River - the young one represents more idealistic, progressive attitudes, the older one hangs onto a harsher, more traditional, more survivalist ideology. But BOTH characters in The Searchers make sense to me - they seem real. \n\nIn many ways the film is confusing. Are Ethan and Martin really saving Debbie?  By the time they find her she doesn't appear to be mistreated, and they might be \"rescuing\" her from the only life she knows. There is little examination of what she has gone through - although some terrible things are inferred - and obviously there is lots of sickening brutality inflicted by the Comanche on the Edwards family and others. But this film isn't an PC examination of the complex racial issues that occurred with the \"settling\" of the West, the devastating near genocide of the Native Americans and ways they pushed back. It's not that. It's just a personal story about a few people. And what a story it is.\n\nThe narrative isn't always perfect - but damn that first half hour is. Beautifully sets the scene, the main characters, and then climaxes with a suspenseful attack on the Edwards homestead. We don't see the attack itself, but the build up to it is chilling, and the aftermath (one shot famously homage in my favourite movie) is heart-rending. After this first half hour, the pace of The Searchers might be too slow and repetitive for many ADHD millennials. But that's kinda the point - the \"search\" crosses several years, and the breadth of a continent. The ideological conflict between Ethan and Martin - especially in regards to Debbie's fate - drives the main narrative, but there is plenty of filler that works well too - the actions bits (especially the river conflict) are brilliant, and ANY scene than Ward Bond's Reverend appears in is worthwhile - he hams it up a lot, yes - but his natural chemistry and hard-edged banter with Wayne are gold. Less successful are the \"romance\" scenes with Laurie and the Jorgensen family stuff - I appreciate that they lighten the dramatic tone of the main narrative - and they serve that purpose well - but they are played a little too broadly IMHO (Charlie McCorry is basically retarded and yet he was designed for 1950s-style laughs?) A softer tone here that established a warmer, quieter family environment  would have made Debbie's return more resonant. But it's ok. Mose Harper and his rock solid abs and old man senility get a bit wearying towards the end, but overall I liked him and his desire for a rocking chair by the fire.\n\nI liked ALL of the filler stuff, but I LOVED the main narrative, the drama, the action, the performances and the lensing. John Wayne's best performance, I reckon. John Ford's undoubted masterpiece. And yes...one of the most classic American films of all time.",

But more than just making a social statement like other Westerns of the period were apt to do, Ford instills in 'The Searchers' a visual poetry and a sense of melancholy that is rare in American films and rarer still to Westerns. The film also features John Wayne in what is arguably his best performance.",

John Wayne plays a flawed centerpiece, a grizzled former soldier with a chip on his shoulder and a strange, conflicted relationship with his extended family. As usual, cool confidence and raw masculinity seep from his pores and he takes hold of each scene with a pair of strong, old cowherder's hands. This is a film that rewards an active imagination, as there's much going on between the lines that, without being spelled out, brands the cast with an unusual level of depth and detail. Unspoken histories flesh out most every character, allowing even generic walk-ons to mosey into the picture at most any moment and cast ripples throughout the entire tapestry. It can be slow at times, and the casting of a very obviously non-native actor to lead the stereotypical enemy Comanche tribe doesn't sit well, but both such faults can be generally chalked up to the dated eccentricities of that era. Take the time to soak it all in, to look deeper than the superficial story, and you'll find a wealth of spoils.",

I did not expect his character, Ethan Edwards, to be so mentally unhinged, in his determined search for the extended family members who survived a raid led by Comanche chief Scar (non-Native Henry Brandon). The action sequences, between cowboys and natives, thrilled me as I had anticipated, but The Searchers is not an action film. Those sequences barely make up 10% of the running time. No, this movie is a dramatic adventure through the Wild West, seeing how Ethan and his part-Cherokee step-nephew Martin (non-Native Jeffrey Hunter) endure seasons of moving without any progress in their quest. Not only do we examine the relationship between Ethan and Martin, but we also see how Martin handles his relationship with love interest Laurie (Vera Miles), who longs to marry Martin but has no interest in waiting for him to finish his quest, if he does. These examinations could have suffered from encouraging macho-masculine attitudes, but the screenwriters, actors, and director John Ford opt for justifying character actions because of personal, unveiled turmoil. At one point, Martin reveals that he is concerned for the safety of Ethan, who is liable to engage in a killing spree, should the opportunity present itself. Ethan knows that, and he does not care to explain why. That mental mystery has me all the more fascinated in his character, whose motives are ambiguous up to and including the conclusion of the quest. The script suffers only from some thin jokes on village idiocy, domestic abuse, and a fight sequence that lasts longer than it should have. If you watch The Searchers, you will know which one I am talking about. For those who have interest in John Wayne or the Wild West, The Searchers will suit your style while providing an entertaining, beautifully and woefully shot adventure and an uncommonly -- for its time -- unstable protagonist for your pleasure.",

With equality is universally accepted, modern audience will just think it is no big deal. However, when you compare it with the profane 'Cimarron', you witness the world is changing. Despite playing a flawed and racist hero, John Wayne exemplifies the humanity and imperfectness of humans, which is more realistic instead of imaginary supermen. Stunning cinematography showing the bright Utah desert. Few movies could have surpassed it even for today.",

I had wanted to watch it with my dad, since I don't think he had seen it, or forgotten.  I'll have to do it again soon.  \n\nThis time I watched it with a Bogdonavich commentary on the DVD and his explanations as to why the film was great throughout were insightful and made me appreciate the film all the more.  However, this film always has a sadness about it that makes it hard to watch.  The tragedy of the whole makes me feel hopeless.  Regardless, it is still one of the finest Westerns ever made, arguably one of the top 5 ever and one of Ford's best.  The commentary made me appreciate Ford so much more than what I had.  For that Ford will be one of my favorites.  The cast is also stellar with Wayne also leading in a grizzled, hardened cowboy who has a complicated character that we are torn into supporting.  \n\n8/9/13 - 4.5/5 - Arguably the best western ever made. It certainly is the most beautiful shot movie that's set in monument valley.  1001 movies to see before you die.\n\nIt also is a rare western that looks at the struggle for searching for kidnapped kin. It has a great cast with Wayne, woods and miles. It's often somber, yet compelling. I would almost call it realist.  Saw on TCM.",

            "content": "Directed by John Ford, whose name defines the American Western, created this epic based on the 1954 novel of the same name by Alan Le May and produced by businessman and philanthropist Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. Ford was reunited with his regular leading man John Wayne, (they had countless collaborations together), and this does make for a very good film, and the grand vistas of the old west come out brilliantly in widescreen here. It begins in 1868, where Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returns from the American Civil War to his the ranch that belongs to his brother Aaron (Walter Coy), which he lives on with his wife Martha (Dorothy Jordan), their son Ben (Robert Lyden) and daughters Debbie (Lana Wood) and Lucy (Pippa Scott). But there's been wars in and around the ranch with the Comanche Indians, and they use a theft to lure Ethan and Aaron away from the ranch, where the house is burnt down, and the daughters have been abducted by the Comanche tribe. Ethan and Aaron swear revenge on the Comanche tribe for what they've done, but finding Debbie and Lucy isn't easy, and sneaking up on the Comanche's isn't easy, and it takes a lot of time for them to get even, but Ethan and Aaron put together a band of Rangers to help. It's heart is in the right place, but it's not very sympathetic to the Comanche Indians either. But, this made great use of VistaVision, which looks great on screen, but it is a long film, and it takes a while for our heroes to extract their bloody revenge. But Ford gets the best from his cast, and it's easy to see why it's a beloved western.",
