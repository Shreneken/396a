His storytelling lies in plain sight that throws realistic details in every frame, It's so poetically heart wrenching. Every frame is illustriously beautiful, Dynamically executed and portrayed. I'm speechless, Never seen a film 3.5 hours long with this much attention and such emotions. It shows how powerful Kurosawa's direction is!\n\nIt's undoubtedly one of the greatest films of last century. A poetic masterpiece that teaches you the art of war in a utter painful way.",

The long runtime allowed Kurosawa to start and finish a large number of side plots that give texture and gravity to the events of the main story. \n\nThere are some genuinely emotionally arresting scenes, particularly the ones in which the farmers essentially shame the samurai into helping them by pointing out how destitute and powerless they are. Toshiro Mifune's character also really breaks out in the scene where he rages at the other samurai for looking down on the farmers for killing fleeing samurai and stealing their weapons. \n\nWhile the ending provides closure, it isn't tidy. The movie has real stakes and doesn't just give you a fairytale finish.",

As with all Kurasawa's films, it is incredibly well made with authentic scenery that would give meaning to the term epic and the camera work is truly spectacular. This is especially true in the final battle, with inspired use of moving and multiple camera, precise editing, telephoto lenses and variegated film speeds. As always with Kurasawa, the direction is consistently brilliant. Add to that a stirring score from Fumio Hayasaka and a thoughtful script and you have more reasons why Seven Samurai is so good. The story unfolds slowly, but never felt dull to me and is never hampered by the three-and-a-half-hour running time. Plus Seven Samurai is interesting for being one of the first few to utilise the plot element of recruiting/gathering of heroes into a team to achieve a goal, seen especially with when the audience is first introduced Kambei. The action is spectacular and looks even better with the use of multiple cameras from various angles, and any humanity Seven Samurai has, and it does have a lot, is shown in a poignant way. The cast are excellent, with Takashi Shimura and especially Toshiro Mifune the standouts.

But the cinematography within this film was a major contribution to having it so high despite the movie being long for me. With how Akira Kurosawa is able to have the space around a subject(s) look full and not empty at all (despite having one subject in some scenes in the middle of a field/road). Another aspect of the movie I liked would have to be how he was able to combine multiple genres of film into one (comedy, drama, romance, and etc) it almost feels like it set in stone how movies come afterward try to have more than one genre to make the film interesting like Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. The last reason I rated this movie so high is because Kurosawa let the death of each villain be seen as important to the film and characters since it shows how smart the characters are for having each defeat a great one to mark down and progresses the film into something greater with good plot development.",

It feels real, this feels like we're getting a peak into what life was like back then. Throughout the movie you know people are going to die which is such a breathe of fresh air compared to movies now and that's what makes it feel so real. I thought the acting in this movie was phenomenal, especially with the characters Kambei and Kikuchiyo. Something unique about the story I found very interesting was a very simple but true line, \"The village has won, not us.\" Not many stories include a plot where the heroes and the villains both lose but the innocents prevail. I loved the emotional impact I felt from this film especially since I watched this movie in subtitles. An example of this is when Kikuchiyo picks up the baby and says, \"This is me!\"",

The way the story evolves and grows with the characters as they each get to know one another and their purpose, is conceived very smartly.  Yes, the battles and latter conclusion are masterful and exciting, but the buildup is where it truly shines and sets the tone.  Character development and how they prepare and train before the inevitable conflict, is Kurosawa's genius on display here.  Pacing and storyline work perfectly with character introductions and development and add up to a masterful film that does nothing poorly or without purpose.",

Whether directly remade, as in the Magnificent Seven, or through its influence, this film was one that changed history.   The story of Seven Samurai warriors that come to the defense of a defenseless farming village against raiding pirates.  Much of the early part of the film is getting you acquainted with the characters.   They are complex and interesting.  They are sometimes funny.    The film is the same, but there are deeply moving scenes as well.   The scene where the villager forcibly cuts his adult daughter's hair to make her appear as a male to save her from being raped by the pirates was haunting to me.  This is a visually masterful movie.  The use of a soundtrack throughout the entire film is equally haunting.   To think about a film in  the world, so close to the end of WWII, that was so well received and so impactful is a testament to the universal themes inhabited by this classic.   It is long, it is subtitled, but it is worth it.  Toshiro Mifune, as the most interesting and complex of the Samurai, is one of my favorite film characters of all times.",

            "content": "Generally considered one of the greatest films of all time, Seven Samurai spins the American Western for feudal Japan while also laying the foundation for dozens of films over the next 70 years. Boiled down, the film concerns a village that faces annual ruthless attacks from bandits, which depletes them of food and women. The first chunk of the film focuses on two villages, Mosuke (Yoshio Kosugi) and Yohei (Bokuzen Hidari) convincing ronin (masterless samurai) named Kambei (Takashi Shimura) to aid them in their struggle. However, the poor villagers cannot offer anything except for food, so Kambei must find honorable warriors who will fight for duty and glory over money — this kicks-off five consecutive \"you son-of-a-bitch, I'm in\" moments. According to Wikipedia, Kurosawa had originally planned to name the film Six Samurai but decided six stoic warriors was too bland, so he added the character of Kikuchiyo, played by the incredible Toshiro Mifune, to add some un-predictableness, comedy, and an entire subplot that comments on who a samurai is and what he stands for. Kikuchiyo, the most recognizable character from the film, wields the most recognizable symbol — an oversized katana that exemplifies his outsider status. A bull in a china-shop, Mifune showcases his acting prowess just as much here as he does in Throne of Blood (and likely many other films). Apparently, Mifune was supposed to play Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi), but the Kikuchiyo character addition opened it up to Miyaguchi, who was excellent as the stealthy, totally badass sword-master of few words. The last hour and a half — which is the length of many full movies — is just fantastic filmmaking. It's high-stakes intensity with nothing but practical effects; it's the 1950s, after all. I did find it unrealistic that the bandits would just continue the same tactics even though they weren't working early on. Kambei's final words, \"In the end we lost this battle too. The victory belongs to the peasants, not to us,\" followed by the shot of the burial mounds is a somber ending that sheds light on the true nature of ronin.",

However, at the risk of committing sacrilege, there are a couple of negative issues worth addressing, the most obvious being the length of the film.  Seven Samurai clocks in at almost three and a half hours, arguably far too long considering the nature of the story.  When watched objectively the second time around, countless scenes drag on much longer than necessary, an example being the scene introducing Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune) as the seventh samurai, which dwells far too long on his drunken antics.

The movie has well-realized characters and very impressive cinematography. It is also clear that this story inspired many other movies through the decades and it deserves some credit for that as well. I think the commitment to extensive character development makes the movie's more emotional moments have more of an impact, but it also means the movie isn't always the fastest moving. This movie is three and a half hours long and I really felt it. There is some excitement in the last hour that brings everything full circle, but I don't think I can see myself watching the movie again. Overall, I think the film is technically very well made, even more so considering when it was made, but as a whole, I personally think it is a bit overhyped.",

At its heart is the righteousness of seven selfless warriors. The weak link here is WHY these good-hearted guys risk their lives for nothing more than the bare minimum of food and shelter. It's not because they hate injustice, since, as samurai, they're essentially thugs themselves. It's not because they love the town they're defending; they're utter strangers. Seems we're asked to believe these mercenaries commit to murder, and the risk of being murdered, in a battle that stretches on for days, simply because the ringleader is kind and charismatic? Still, what makes \"Seven Samurai\" such a pleasure is the cast of original characters -- the unpretentious leader, the deeply devoted acolyte and most of all, the ridiculous clown figure, jeered at by the group, until he earns his way into the noble fold, not by bluster, but bravery.",

As strategies are hatched and strongholds fortified, we get to know both villagers and warriors on a close, personal level, uncovering their stories as the seasons change and invasion grows imminent.\n\nLegend has it that Kurosawa went far above and beyond in fleshing out this cast, composing detailed family trees and personality profiles for each of the hundred-plus roles to help his actors (even the extras) get under their characters' skin. That level of crazy hyper-focus is indicative of the whole production, which vastly overstepped its budget and shot for nearly four times longer than originally scheduled, but the results can't be denied.\n\nSeven Samurai is a justifiably revered classic, a prototype for the modern action movie (not to mention a roadmap for the entire western genre), and a rich portrait of a very specific time and cultural relationship in Japanese history. It may linger too long - there's definitely still some fat on the bone in the two-hundred minute theatrical cut - but the extra quiet time with important characters pays off in the dramatic, joltingly conclusive, final conflict.",

            "content": "The greatest samurai film.\n\nAkira Kurosawa's samurai epic adventure Seven Samurai (1954) is a timeless journey of friendship, brotherhood, honor, kindness, bravery, and duty. Kurosawa directs Seven Samurai with an eye for shadowy silhouettes on the horizon, wind gusting by dust cradled villages, and rain deluging the ground to create ungodly mud soaked paths. Seven Samurai feels like a tribute to the code of the samurai by virtue of its protagonist's courage in facing off against unfair numbers for the righteous cause of defending a farming village.  \n\nAkira Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto, and Hideo Oguni's writing champions the working class of impoverished farmers by lending the viewer to see feudal era Japan through their suffering lens. Their desperation for help implores the audience to care about the poor, thus respecting the hero samurai in their just cause. Theirs is a neat script of heartfelt sympathy, realistic empathy, and clever plotting. Seven Samurai is just impeccably well directed and written.\n\nAsakazu Nakai's cinematography is striking with close-ups of the samurai's flag panning down across the symbols to invading bandits charging down the mountainside on horseback. You get unforgettable imagery like the young samurai picking cherry blossoms in the flower field as well as when he sits near the girl in the field as they say nothing in that first fateful exchange. Nakai also gives you advancing samurai and bandits within the village all clashing in a chaotic fray to the ultra controlled shot of the bandit leader looking out at the opposing samurai from behind the fence. Seven Samurai simply looks gorgeous and creative in every scene.\n\nFumio Hayasaka and Masaru Satô's score to Seven Samurai is pounding and melodic alike. The main theme is triumphant and inspiring with a timeless folk hero quality to it. I really like the music within Seven Samurai. Akira Kurosawa edited Seven Samurai himself with a steady pace that deliberately forces you to think about each character and their feelings. Various transition edits splice hours of samurai heroics together for a clear and complex perspective.\n\nJunjirô Yamada's makeup is a nice blend of dirty peasant and stalwart samurai aesthetic. You never question if a character looks realistic for the era. Similarly, Kôhei Ezaki and Mieko Yamaguchi's costume designs look like period accurate samurai armor, bandit attire, and farmer clothing. Their costume choices keep Seven Samurai within its feudal era of Japan. It's cool that \nYoshirô Muraki, Takashi Matsuyama, and Sô Matsuyama's production feels so authentic to Japan's farming village appearances. Rustic homes of bamboo, wood, and straw are slapped together for a very grounded visual approach.\n\nThe acting is superb. I particularly like Takashi Shimura as the older, wise samurai named Kambei Shimada. His calm wisdom and fierce gravitas make for a captivating performance. Likewise,Toshirō Mifune is fearsome and delightful as the erratic and likable samurai warrior called Kikuchiyo. Seven Samurai is so profoundly compelling because of these riveting performances by esteemed actors conveying the nuanced nature of each samurai.\n\nIn all, Seven Samurai remains a classic staple of the samurai genre and an influential picture on future films the world over.",

For that, mad props.\n\nResolution: 10\n\nOverall: 80\nFor Seven Samurai to be as slow as it is yet as good as it is is a testament to the movie as a whole. It's beautiful, meaningful, and is at least trying to win your heart. If it was indeed a five-course meal, four of those courses were delicious. I could have skipped the salad.",

            "content": "The film I was scared to watch the most. My journey with film truly began just over five years ago in June of 2013. Over the course of the next few years I began to familiarize myself with more “out of the box” films I wasn’t used to seeing. Within the last two years my horizons have expanded further than I could have envisioned in such a small amount of time. Foreign films were always the most challenging because of nearly two decades of American made cinema being etched into my brain. I always knew of Akira Kurosawa, but I didn’t know Akira Kurosawa like I do now. Rashomon was the first AK film I had seen due to it’s sweet run-time and influence it had made on many films I’ve already seen. Recently I had seen his Macbeth adaptation with Throne of Blood, but sitting atop of his filmography was his most beloved and influential work yet, Seven Samurai. A two word, five syllable behemoth that titled the 207 minute masterpiece that loomed over me like the grim reaper roaming a graveyard. Thankfully, without any hesitation, the grim reaper I thought was there was secretly a fountain of reinvigoration for cinema. Purchased for 26 U.S. Dollars, I obtained the Criterion of Seven of Samurai and it was better than I ever imagined. The aspect ratio magnify’s the beauty, brotherhood, and bond between samurai and villager with the utmost precision. The use of foreground, middle ground, and background plays a huge role in the immersion of this simple story. That’s the key word, simple. Many films we see today boast hefty run-times but jam pack them full of convoluted plotting and half-baked ideas. Seven Samurai hits a hole-in-one on a Par five. Showcasing the greatness that simplicity has to offer and simultaneously blowing your mind in the process. It’s funny, heart-warming, gut-wrenching, beautifully acted, and heroically epic. It’s the ultimate tale of leadership and the losses and gains confronted in one’s personal standing amidst an impending war. An unprecedented masterpiece of world class film-making from one of the greatest visionaries to ever be birthed onto this planet. Defense wins championships and Akira hoists the trophy with his teammates right alongside him.",

            "content": "Oh my god.\n\nI've never been too big on old Japanese films, but if this absolute masterpiece is anything to go by . . . I really should try some more of them.\n\nSeven Samurai is over three hours and twenty minutes long, but never for a moment did I feel that the pacing became slow or the plot was stretched thin. Every single moment, every second of the camera rolling, I found there to be precision and meticulousness. Director Akira Kurosawa and his cast and crew did wonders to bring this powerhouse story into possibly one of the most influential movies ever made.\n\nThe characters, from the wise and ever-dependable Kambei to the wild, impulsive but kind-hearted Kikuchiyo are so well-defined and well acted. They form the key seven who are dedicated to saving a village from a group of bandits. Honor, respect and determination come to front by doing so, and the audience finds a new layer of affection for these often rough but kind characters. Battle scenes are expertly choreographed, and the chorus music blends with the sound of drums to make a heart-racing, almost suffocating atmosphere of impending attack. The direction demands your attention every second of the way. It's an incredible feat to make a film that spans for more than three hours and never lets the audience lose attention.\n\nA father of all westerns, this Japanese masterpiece is rightfully hailed. I want to put in my own two cents and say this is one of the best films I've ever seen. Seven Samurai is pure gold.",

Ticking for around 200 minutes, it never feels overstretched, but is elaborated in detail; the difference that the makers are aware of and keeps it separate throughout the course of it. It is rich on technical aspects like sound effects, choreography and production design. Akira Kurosawa; the screenwriter and director, has done an excellent on executing the anticipated vision, and also keeping the tone of the feature alive for such a long period, takes a lot skill and passion towards the project to pull it off. Each individual character in here is allotted a specific track to portray which they do hold on to tightly. There is a lot of concrete material which never gets overstuffed, as the makers take their time whilst holding few tactics to keep the audience on the edge of the seat and engaged through the process. Shichinin No Samurai is an emblem of unity that shines unflinchingly that is at best a classic culmination of all genres and at worst an action packed feature; both the side, it's a win-win.",

The story is perfect.  The characters and acting are memorable.  Director Akira Kurosawa has a fantastic sense of pace, and even at three and a half hours, every scene seems important.  We're transported to 16th century Japan, a time when bandits terrorize the countryside and a village of farmers, but the film's themes are timeless.  \n\nAs epic as the movie is, with a samurai team of six assembled one by one by its leader (Takashi Shimura), it would not have been the same without the seventh, a samurai-wannabe played by Toshiro Mifune.  He's brash, exuberant, funny, brave, foolish, and heartfelt.  He's in many brilliant scenes, but my favorite is when he describes what tricks the farmers may be up to, and we gradually understand that he himself was a farmer's son, with a tragic past.  His performance is right up there with Brando in terms of intensity and honesty.\n\nKurosawa is smart in so many ways here, one of which is to orient the viewer to the village and its surroundings by showing the leader of the group plan its defense.  In addition to Mifune's character, he also lightens the mood with the forbidden love between the young samurai apprentice (Isao Kimura) and a young woman masquerading as a boy (Keiko Tsushima).  Their scene in the woodland flowers is gorgeous.  \n\nI love how the samurai are as tough as nails, but know they don't need to show it, and instead exude a sense of calm, playfulness, and understanding.  With the exception of an extremely skillful and solemn swordsman (Seiji Miyaguchi), they smile in many scenes, and all of them accept the difficulty and danger of their fate.  Despite their skill, they do not seek out violence.  They are calm in moments of peace, intelligent in planning for battle, and brave and unflinching under attack.  While the film and these character types have been emulated many times over the years, the difference between these samurai and western action heroes is still stark, and refreshing.  \n\nIn this little village and the situation it faces, we see a microcosm of the world.  Despite the mythic quality of a small outnumbered band of heroic samurai, the film has an authenticity to it.  We see all of the very natural reactions to pressure.  There are themes you might expect: honor, duty, discipline, and that sort of thing, but at its core, the message is the need to stand up to evil, and the great debt that we owe to those who have done so.",

But there is a lot of humor, with some characters providing a bit of levity in the face of danger, others laughing at it. And need I say more about the action? Every sequence is shot well, every sword strike is dealt with purpose, and its hour long climax brings its all. You can definitely see its massive influence in many films that follow, and for good reason. With Seven Samurai, Kurosawa brought the best out of the cinema art form and what it had to offer.",

En esta extensa película (3 horas y veinte minutos) acerca de un grupo de samurais del siglo XVI, contratados por un poblado para luchar contra unos bandidos, Kurosawa logra un tarbajo fuerte, delicado y muy humano, donde Toshiro Mifune es deliciosamente divertido y Takashi Shimura demuestra su amplio rango como actor.

            "content": "When it comes to all-time classic films, the title Seven Samurai gets thrown around a lot. Released in 1954, spawning many different versions as time went on, most notably the 1960 recreation known as The Magnificent Seven, Seven Samurai is not just your average epic. Taking its time to tell its brilliant, yet simple story to its audience, it was clear that director Akira Kurosawa expected a much maturer demographic. Released over 60 years ago, films of the 1940's and 1950's are very rarely talked about, with the exceptions of a few everlasting ones. People say that the likes of Citizen Kane or The Wizard of Oz are the best of the best from those decades, but not enough people talk about Kurosawa's masterpiece in Seven Samurai. Here is why I believe it is still one of the greatest films out there, even today.\n\nWhile it is without question that its 206 minute running time can be daunting to some viewers, it just goes to show that the attention span for cinema has dwindled over the years. Upon its initial release, films featured intermissions approximately halfway through, thus giving the audience a bit of time to let everything sink in. Today's films have to rush everything into a maximum of two hours or its audience will begin to lose interest. It is sad but true, with the exception of a few greats. Giving just enough screen time to each and every one of the main characters, this film balances its cast perfectly. Utilizing its action sequences just as things may start getting a little boring, Kurosawa knows exactly where and when to place every scene. I admire this film for every risk it takes, and every one that it doesn't.\n\nAlthough I mention that its pacing is slower due to the fact that it focusses on every character in order to make you care about them, Seven Samurai is also no stranger to exciting action sequences. Even though it is still brutal for the time, the shots composed throughout every epic action sequence feels rich and cared for. Not a frame of this film occurs without purpose and I cannot admire a film that does that enough. Seven Samurai makes you feel emotions that you never thought you would feel from watching a samurai epic. In the end, I was sucked in and put on the edge of my seat. Sure, watching this film nowadays, you can see the outcome from a mile away, due to the fact that many films have borrowed its story elements over the years, but for its time, the ending is simply beautiful.\n\nThe plot to this film is simple. A group of bandits threaten to steal all of the rice being harvested by farmers. Afraid of losing everything, they recruit seven samurai warriors to train with them in order to strike when the time comes. With a plot like this, you are looking at a 90 minute running time for any average movie with this plot nowadays, but the fact that this film takes its time to flesh out every character and tastefully stage its action sequences so that you care about everything that is going on, makes for even even greater experience. There are endless things to love about this classic picture.\n\nIn the end, this is a film that I can easily recommend to any cinema lover who doesn't mind a longer film. If you do not like sitting through lengthy films and you do not enjoy subtitles or cannot speak the languages spoken throughout the film, it may not be for you. That being said, this is a rich looking epic, with incredible direction, great performances for its time, a simple story told with vigour and care, as well as pacing that flies by if you are able to follow everything that is happening. I love this film from start to finish and it definitely deserves recognition as one of the greats. I quite simply do not have anything to complain about here. Seven Samurai is cinema at its best.",

            "content": "Setting up a story that would be reinterpreted hundreds of times by other film-makers, this original film from Akira Kurosawa is certainly epic. At three-and-a-half hours quite a lot happens, much of it is action-packed, but there are definitely some slower moments too. I actually didn't mind any of the times the action slowed down because they did such a superb job of establishing characters and making me care about what they were going through. The truly shocking thing about Seven Samurai is that this might be the first movie where I enjoyed the building of the team scenes more than the execution of their mission. Slowly meeting each one of these samurai, and getting to know their individual personalities was wonderful. I struggled at times to differentiate the farmers from one another, but the samurai were the real leads of the film and I felt like I knew every one of them. The climax in the final act had some really great and satisfying moments, but there was also a lot of repetition. I felt that the small moments of one-on-one battle were infinitely more powerful than these huge masses of people running around and spearing each other. I even lost track a few times of who was killing who in those battle sequences. I think there is a lot of brilliant stuff going on in this movie from a cinematography, costuming, and effects standpoint. It makes the movie look so alive and exciting. Just looking at the final shot makes you realize why this movie is so iconic. Seven Samurai is groundbreaking, and I suspect I might enjoy it more if I watch it again in the future. However, as I start to explore other films that reused the same story structure, I wonder if I will find that it's just easier for me to get attached to a shorter film where I don't have to read subtitles. That doesn't take away from this movie, but it shows how shallow my movie opinions can be sometimes. This is definitely a movie that I think movie fans should watch, even if it's just to see where all these ideas came from. Also the story is structured in such a way that, even though Seven Samurai is really long, you could easily watch it in smaller chunks without missing much.",

            "content": "Let me ask you a quick question: When you're watching a movie, what's the first thing you notice or look for? Acting? Lighting? Color? Shots? Shapes? All of these are just naming a few great elements of what makes a movie so special, as there's plenty more out there that I probably left out, but those are mostly the key ones that some film makers choice when making a movie. But when I watch a movie, the first thing I look for is hidden quality, storytelling by the characters movements, acting, lighting, and the use of silence to add emotion to a scene. And yes, this movie absolutely has all of those things I love in movies and much more. I think I died and went to movie heaven.  \n\nSometimes when I talk about a beloved movie that many film makers  and critics out there consider a \"masterpiece\", I think it's very important for me to talk about the actual film making and what makes it so great, as this gives a better thought of what I see when I watched the movie. I mean, it's much better than saying what you like or didn't about a film without talking about the film making itself. Oh and this also my first Akira Kurosawa movie I've watched and reviewed, so there's that. I've heard nothing but amazing things about Kurosawa movies and how every famous director has put him up there as the best director that has ever lived, and I totally understand why, because Akira Kurosawa is one of the most stylish,  influential, and one of the most tremendous film maker that has ever lived. From start till finish, I was completely in awed from what I was watching and it's still fresh in my mind as I'm writing this.\n\nFor Kurosawa's film career, he has made over 30 films and a few TV movies, but \"Seven Samurai\" seems to be the one movie that everyone knows about (even if there haven't seen it). And I understand why, as everything with the camera work, editing transitions, and the use of mother nature as an emotional trigger for the audience, is everything that an audience can emotional relate to and draw their eye to. Because the choices of weather used in scenes that basically sums up what kind of mood a character or a scene itself is feeling. Wind, sunshine, and rain, really do add a lot to the scene, as you can tell what you're suppose to be feeling. Akira Kurosawa was quite famous for how he wanted to get the weather perfect in his scenes. Over a course of a year, he shot this movie for 148 days and it was often him waiting for the weather for the next scene. \n \nAnd that's not all, Kurosawa told his actors to chose a gesture for their character and stick with it. That way, we know exactly what kind person their are and how they're feeling. It's bold film making like this is what made Akira Kurosawa a massive influence to cinema today.     \n\nAnother thing I loved about this movie is the characters, as I actually did care for them and their struggle. I sometimes find it very hard to have a full emotional attachment to characters in movies, but here, it amazes me how I know so much from the characters just by their movements that really dose say a lot without them saying anything. All the praise has to go to the actors for this, as it was them who had to deliver and they absolutely do. I'm unaware with all of these actors, but then again, I don't watch that much black and white Japans movies these days. All of the cast were all superb in their roles and most have been a very different cult challenge to pull off, because it's not easy as it looks, but all of them nailed it. \n\nThe camera work in this movie is so impressive, so unique, and freaking glorious. The way the camera moves tells a story of itself that doesn't require any character to spill out the story or what's going on. I could show any scenes from this movie to someone who hasn't see the movie themselves and even they will have a full grasp on whats going or how someone is feeling without knowing nothing about the movie itself. That's how brilliant this movie.      \n\nOverall: Seven Samurai is a epic masterpiece with flawless imagery and a unique style of violence and battles. I can not wait to see Kurosawa other movies, as I have a feeling I'm going to love them.",

Seven Samurai which was directed by master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and stars the late Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, is a grand samurai epic near unparalleled. It was not until I bought the 3 disc criterion edition and watched it did I realize this film is a beautiful master work! To start off I loved the story Kurosawa had written for the film with his talent for language and literature seen in every scene, shot, and performance. The narrative follows Seven Samurai hired by a group of poor farmers to protect their village and food from a collective of invading bandits. It is an awesome tale that elevates itself into something more with each character's individual story. I found it interesting how Kurosawa incorporated the historical account of the conflicting lifestyles between the villagers and the samurai while incorporating subtle comedy and a romance into it. The visual decor and cinematography expressed on the now restored black and white film are astounding from the shot of the samurai bowing to the grave of a fallen comrade to the epic battle scenes between the samurai and the bandits. Most importantly the performances done by the actors and actresses were achieved with genuine direction. The samurai are performed with a balance of gentle humor and swift ambition that adds grace to their characters as they interact with the scenery. Toshiro Mifune's character, Kikyushio is developed and likable to the point you begin to feel great sympathy for him, observing his transformation from a drunken loner who carries a huge sword and respected by nobody to a true honorable samurai accepted among the other six. All of the samurai are awesome including the leader played by Shimura as the elder ronin, Kambei who takes the young Katsushiro under his wing. Kyuzo is probably the most impressive of the seven who has deadly skill with a blade, quick and silent while maintaining control and courage. The love story between Katsushiro and the village girl, Shino is touching, affecting, and handled with care by Kurosawa without being over the top. To conclude I love Seven Samurai and feel it is one of the great masterpieces deserving of the title \"Classic.\" It is one of my favorite films, but also an important film for students such as myself to study in order to understand the work of an influential director such as Kurosawa. A heartrending and visually powerful epic delivered by one of the world's great directors.",

It's stunt scenes are realistic, but as a film seen as the best amongst the samurai films, Kurasowa's action sequences are disappointing as the often look extremely lazy.

            "content": "If memory serves, this is the first, or at least one of the first, Japanese movies I've seen that wasn't animated. I'd heard plenty of things about it, and for the most part I believe its acclaim is well deserved.  Despite being close to the longest film I've ever seen (The longest being Ben-Hur), I was never bored, though I felt that many of the scenes, particularly in the second half, could have been cut significantly. It's easy to see how influential everything from the direction to the main storyline, subsequently employed in many Westerns, and even in Pixar classic A Bugs Life, has been on later films. There's a very grand feel to it, even in the small village scenes, and the acting feels so natural you could often forget you're watching a piece of fiction, though many elements, including the personalities of the eponymous Seven, were apparently adapted from real life. The movie highlights the plight of the weak and helpless in the face of fierce opposition, and the Samurai, while not all developed or even very memorable, make for very likeable heroes. The real stand-out is Kikuchiyo, played with total commitment by Toshiro Mifune. Rising above his role as simple comic relief, which does get a lot of laughs and brings a tongue in cheek humour to the often grim atmosphere, his performance slowly pulls back layers to expose his true nature and the depths of his character.\nI found the climactic battles to be somewhat disappointing considering the build-up, mainly due to the lack of sound from the weapons, making even fatal blows come across as completely ineffective. Also with so many characters, most of whom dress and act in a similar fashion, made it hard to distinguish between them, and I can't recall too many names. Also on repeated viewings its length and long periods of quiet would become very frustrating. But it can't be praised enough for what it did for the genre, and for film in general. Many of today's directors praise it's originality and how much it pushed the envelope, and as time goes on it'll be rightly remembered.",

Suffering perpetrated by vultures of greed whose next attack, the farmers profess, will sentence the village extinct. What can be done? Everything that follows stems from the instinct of survival. Instinct camouflaged in delusions of honor, justice, altruism and bravery. Instinct fed by fear, despair and love. Thus begins the existential crusade to preserve the dearest and most precious human virtues in a cruel and amoral world.\n\nAppeals for the samurai conduct warrant provisions for the battle ahead. But the only distinction between a samurai and a non-samurai is one's mask: the world we invent for ourselves is only a disguise for our fears and denials. A farce that falls apart when heroism meets life's ungratefulness and the harsh truth becomes inescapable: all men are slaves of their mortality in the struggle for survival, samurai or not. Death is oblivious to our titles and dilemmas. But when death strikes, only those who seek to outlive fate are caught off guard. They will never know ephemeral happiness, for life is unforgiving of one's mistakes. Living it humbly is the only way to die undefeated.\n\nA single negative remark: considerable length and slow progression may lead to boredom and distraction. Particularly during the first half where all main characters are slowly introduced. This is heightened by the fact that Kurosawa's cinema may not be particularly easy to chew for some: rewards aren't immediately apparent to viewers, and his movies may even appear aesthetically insipid or plain. Digging below the surface, however, reveals a very different truth. Seven Samurai overflows with beauty and genius subverted between the lines of the cinematic composition. The ability to effortlessly engage and entertain speaks volumes about the amount of thought invested in each take. Almost every sequence was crafted with sculptor's fastidiousness, and the result is near perfect symbiosis between form and function - one of Kurosawa's greatest gifts. Highly recommended!",

It's still good, but the runtime of 3.5 hours doesn't feel all that justified.\n\nThe first 2 hours of this film are nothing but buildup. Nothing wrong with doing some build up, but these first two hours are a little slow despite Kurosawa's technical wizardry firing on all cylinders. With this runtime, we should get to know all of our samurai very well, but we don't. Well, we get some insight into a few of them. Takashia Shimura, Toshiro Mifune, and Isao Kimura are really the only three that get any character development.\n\nWhile the beginning of the film drags it down, the last hour, which is almost all good ol'-fashioned samurai violence is mind-numbingly jaw-dropping. Every fight scene is just amazing to watch. The camera movements in these scenes alone are truly impressive. You don't get lost in the action and you can clearly tell if it's a samurai or a bandit getting killed. This comes close to making up for the first two hours, but not entirely. It's still a very good movie, but it really didn't need to be as long as it is.",

            "content": "Synopsis\nIn 16th century Japan, a group of cowardly farmers are fed up with a group of bandits repeatedly pillaging their crops, taking their women, and destroying their property. In a frantic last attempt to save their people from starvation and their village from total annihilation, a small group of farmers enter into town seeking out a Ronin to fight off the bandits. They end up with more than they bargained for, 7 samurai!\nOne Ronin, Kambei, falls in their laps during a hostage situation. Kambei dresses as a monk in order to enter the building and rescue the hostage. Impressed by his bravery, a young samurai named Katsushir? approaches Kambei, requesting to become his disciple. Kambei later, once introduced to the farmers plea, agrees to help out and soon recruits an old friend Shichir?ji. Soon they recruit 3 more: a friendly Ronin named Gorobei, a Ronin named Heihachi, who is recruited to uplift the spirits of the farmers and Ronin, and a master swordsman Ronin named Ky?z?, is recruited after an intense duel.\nThe last Ronin to be recruited isn't actually recruited. His name is Kikuchiyo, a loud drunk and a cocky wannabe samurai who joins because, despite the attempt of the 6 samurai to drive him away, follows them back to the farmer's village. The 7 Ronin then train the villagers, becoming somewhat like family, and help them rise up against the cruelty of the bandits.\nReview\nFirst and foremost, Kurosawa is the first filmmaker to create this genre. The genre is that of historical fiction with underlying themes of: duty versus inclination, light and shadow, male friendship, and the underdog. Kurosawa's films would later inspire the war, heist, and caper genres we still see in films today. His work also inspired Star Wars and spaghetti westerns (the film A Fistful of Dollars is basically the Americanized remake of Kurosawa's film YoJimo). We aren't talking about some unknown, artsy director here; Kurosawa is regarded as one of the most significant, far reaching, paramount filmmakers in the history of cinema.\n If the awesomeness and prodigious reputation of Seven Samurai's director isn't enough to get you to watch it, the film itself is. This film, Seven Samurai, has something for everyone in it. The film has action, adventure, love, stunts, good versus evil, honor, misfits, bravery, the classic underdog, and imperative social commentary (just to name a few).\nHowever, if you are looking for a film that won't take up much time, this is not it. This film is very long (it even has an intermission) but, don't let that fool you into thinking the plot drags on.  There is not a single moment of boredom, as the plot moves along quickly with clear storytelling and unique characters. \nI highly recommend watching this film at least once in your lifetime. It is a classic that sparked so many films and genres in its wake and is still studied by film students worldwide. It will make you laugh, cry, sit on the edge of your seat, and cheer out loud for the samurai on your screen. The film may have been created in the early 50's, but it still can entertain and relate to audiences today. I believe that is the true test, the test of time, which separates the decent films from the legendary.",

I guess that it was easy for non-Japanese  to follow the movie with the subtitles. \n\n- Actors and Actress \nThe Screenplays were very good.I really love the characters. \n\n - Kikuchiyo, who was played by Toshiro Mifune, was funny.I liked a story when he stole a family tree or pedigree charts.But he couldn't read the letters, Other samurai found his lie.I guess that Japanese people respected someone who were  born in some notable samurai family.But Kikuchiyo was born on a farmer.It was a funny story. \n\nWikipedia says\" The battle scene was shot in February in near-freezing temperatures. Mifune later recalled that he had never been so cold in his life.\" Mifune was almost naked. He made it in such a cold weather.He was a great actor. \n\n- Shino was played by Keiko Tsushima.Great actress. When she had some sexual relationship with a young samurai. She was beaten by her father. Those days, I guessed that a girl  should be a virgin until she married. Especially, it was impossible for farmers to have a sex with samurai, I guess. Anyway, it was a totally different  from modern Japan. I enjoyed their romantic relationships. \n\n-  Kanbei Takashi Shimura.\nHe was a Great military strategist and leader  like Son Su.He was a master of The Art of war. All the students of military schools watch this movie. He knew everything on war. . Some farmers were against him. He convicted and encouraged people to fight bandits. \n\n- This is a  black and white and Monochrome  movie. Kurosawa wished to be a painter. He was a great artist.Later, he made very beautiful colored films such as Ran , Kagemusha. I wish I could watch color film  of Seven Samurai. Especially, when Shino met the young samurai at flower fields,The flowers should have been very beautiful if the movie had been  color! \n\n- Historical background. Without historical knowledge, You enjoy this movie. But some knowledge might be helpful to understand Seven Samurai. This is totally different from modern Japan.A samurai leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi was about unify Japan in 1587.But many samurai lords were still  fighting  uncontrollably with each other,Many farmers were afraid of bandits ,famine, , war. The most of the Japanese were very poor.At the begging of the movie, many farmers were crying. Their life were always miserable. It was very hard for them to eat\"White rice\". That's the reason why people cherished the white rice at Seven Samurai. \n\n- Ronin \nMany samurai lost jobs after they lost war. They were called \"Ronin\". Ronin  was a samurai with no lord or master. Some ronin  worked for farmers just they needed some food.Seven samurai was a movie of ronin samurai without master\n\n- Everything was beautiful Now a days,movie producers can use \" computer graphic. Especially,  in this kind of war and epic, people can rely on the computer. Kurosawa and other Japanese didn't use any computer, I guess. According to wikipedia, Kurosawa and Toho  the peasant  village in Tokyo.Rain, village, nature,  arrows,Tanegashima  (Japanese matchlock gun) and everything looked real!  \n\nI'm a little worried, because I don't feel that I understand cinema yet. I really don't feel that I have yet grasped the essence of cinema. Cinema is a marvelous thing, but to grasp its true essence is very, very difficult.- Akira Kurosawa \n\n- Akira Kurosawa was the greatest director.His pursue to perfection didn't finish.He was extremely an humble man.Camera , music, and others were perfect.This movie is also educational.I learned Leadership skills, military strategy from Kambei, Mifune's professionalism.Hope to enjoy the movie.",

With cinematographer Asaichi Nakai he does amazing things with dappled light and furious movement (by horses and men).  The story has many fabulistic qualities - poor farmers find seven disparate men to help them ward off an army of bandits (who descend on them each year) - although Kurosawa's strengths lie in depicting the little details of their social interactions and their strategies.  Of course, each man has a different quality and backstory - the actors often bring mannerisms to the task of differentiation (Takashi Shimura as the leader often rubs his shaven head and, famously, Toshiro Mifune scratches, pull faces, and clowns around - later inspiring John Belushi).  The first half of the film shows us how the samurai are recruited and form the seven whereas the second half is all battles scenes (with a little romance in the daisies thrown in for the youngest of the force).  As the film progresses, step by step, we are drawn into the action with maps of the area (weak spot to the North), the crossing off of bandits (from the total of 33), and the burial mounds of the samurai (complete with swords on top).  Not everyone survives and the relationship between samurai and farmer may remain unchanged.  A film that can replenish and sustain your energy (like some sort of magic spell).",

Unable to defend themselves, they come up with the idea of hiring unemployed Samurai (Ronin) to fight off these brigands.  \n\nA group of the villagers have travelled to a nearby town to enlist skilled swordsmen who are willing to work only for free meals.

            "content": "The most popular cinematic export from Japan is inarguably the samurai movie. Whole books have been devoted to the genre, and more than one mail-order video business has made a tidy profit shipping samurai tapes and DVDs around the world. The most important samurai movie is Akira Kurosawa's 1954 feature, Seven Samurai, which not only impacted the way the genre was viewed, but elevated its status. Seven Samurai was influential not only in Japan and for foreign film enthusiasts, but it led to a popular and reasonably faithful remake, The Magnificent Seven. And, although Japanese critics during the '50s were dismissive of the picture, it has since achieved an almost mythical status and was recently selected by a group of '00 critics as the Best Japanese Movie of All-Time.\n\nCuriously, for a feature that is often viewed as the standard-bearer of the samurai movie, Seven Samurai is actually an atypical genre entry. An \"average\" samurai film focuses on a sword-wielding, superhero-type individual who battles his way through the story, often triumphing over a seemingly overwhelming host of foes. Seven Samurai offers us flawed protagonists, some of whom are not skilled fighters, and one of whom is often drunk, belligerent, and decidedly non-heroic in his approach. The odds are impressive, yet, in large part due to the melancholy tone adopted by Kurosawa during the closing scene, the victory is hollow, and almost feels like a defeat. (The lead samurai's final words: \"So. Again we are defeated. The farmers have won. Not us.\")\n\nSeven Samurai is richly deserving of its high place in cineaste circles. Despite its epic length and scope, the key to the movie's success is that it focuses on a small group of characters. (The actual number of fully realized individuals is three, not seven - several of the \"secondary\" samurai are only sketchily developed.) The narrative is straightforward, allowing numerous opportunities for elaborate action sequences. In fact, the bulk of the movie's second half is comprised of battle scenes. These are clearly delineated and exactingly choreographed. Kurosawa, a meticulous craftsman, does not rely on editing sleight-of-hand to present fights. His stylistic imprint is emblazoned upon every frame. (Seven Samurai was filmed with a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. For a sample of what Kurosawa accomplish in widescreen, check out some of his later films, starting with Hidden Fortress.)\n\nThose familiar with the narrative of The Magnificent Seven will recognize the storyline for Seven Samurai. In order to shoehorn Seven Samurai's 3 1/2 hours of material into The Magnificent Seven's two hours, condensation was mandated. Two of Seven Samurai's lead characters were combined to form a single individual in The Magnificent Seven. For the most part, however, the basics were left intact. After viewing American remake, Kurosawa reportedly remarked that he was pleased with the effort, going so far as to send a gift to filmmaker John Sturges, who helmed the 1960 feature.\n\nSeven Samurai tells the tale of a 16th century Japanese farm community that, led by a band of seven warriors, defends itself against a gang of pillaging robbers. When several of the village's men, lead by a hot-head named Rikichi (Yoshio Tsuchiya), grow weary of the annual raids of the bandits, they decide to act. Since the citizens do not have the martial ability or skill to fight, Rikichi seeks mercenary samurai who are willing to defend the settlement in return for food and lodging. The seven men who accompany Rikichi home are a diverse lot. They include the sage Kambei (Takashi Shimura), a great leader of men; Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), a burly clown whose prowess with a sword does not match his arrogance; Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi), a quiet master swordsman who lets his weapon speak for him; and young Katsushiro (Isao Kimura), who idolizes Shichiroji and Kambei. Also in the party are Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki), Shichiroji (Daisuke Kato), and Gorobei (Yoshio Inaba). After teaching the men of the town how to fight and preparing the village for its defense (building fences, flooding the rice fields, and tearing down a bridge), the seven samurai await the inevitable coming of the 40-odd bandits and the battle that will determine the peasants' future.\n\nThe film is divided into three sections. The first features the gathering of the protectors, as each samurai is given an introduction. Seven Samurai was the first film to use this approach; it has been copied often in the five decades since Kurosawa completed the movie. This portion of the picture is essentially set-up, but it's crucial to defining the characters and their relationships. The longest introduction belongs to Kikuchiyo, who initially appears as a drunken buffoon, then later proves to be more resourceful than any of his future companions expected.\n\nSeven Samurai's second segment encompasses the preparations for battle. During this portion of the film, the protectors are introduced to the farmers. In addition to fortifying the settlement and teaching the men how to use weapons, a form of bonding occurs. Kikuchiyo becomes a favorite of the village children, and they follow him around. Katsushiro begins a romance with a local girl, Shino (Keiko Tsushima), who willingly offers herself to the samurai despite the dishonor such a liaison would bring upon her and her family. Being in the village also brings back troubling memories for Kikuchiyo, whose past remains shrouded from his fellows.\n\nThe third section is the battle for the village, with the bandits attacking in waves. There's also a pre-emptive strike attempted by the samurai, who raid the bandits' camp before they ride to the village. The bandits have two advantages over their intended prey - they are mounted and they are in possession of three guns. Despite being difficult to load and fire and notoriously unreliable, those weapons represent a significant advantage, and the samurai realize that the key to victory may be stealing at least one of the guns from their enemies. (Nearly all of the early significant casualties are the result of men being shot.)\n\nAlthough Seven Samurai is an ensemble picture, no star shines brighter than Kurosawa's favorite actor, Toshiro Mifune. His Kikuchiyo is larger-than-life. Mifune is given an opportunity to show his range here, playing a stumbling drunk; a playful clown who delights in the company of children; a dark, brooding man who reflects on his unhappy past; and a terrifying fighter who cannot be slowed or stopped. Veteran Takashi Shimura, another frequent Kurosawa collaborator, is the voice of wisdom, reason, and patience as Kambei. The actor presents his character as a man who commands respect through his mere presence. Kambei's coolness is in direct contrast with Kikuchiyo's flamboyance. The third major samurai is Katsushiro. Isao Kimura portrays him with a mixture of energy and naïveté, then blends in a growing sense of somber realization as he recognizes that battle is not all glory.\n\nOf the remaining four samurai, only Seiji Miyaguchi's Kyuzo stands out as memorable, primarily because he is so different from his fellows. Quiet and withdrawn, he is a serious individual who speaks primarily with his sword. Miyaguchi portrays him as an honorable, unsmiling loner. The other three are largely interchangeable until the third or fourth viewing of the film, when their personalities begin to emerge. Of the villagers, only Yoshio Tsuchiya's impulsive Rikichi, Kamatari Fujiwara's dour Manzo, and Keiko Tsushima's sultry Shino gain any real individuality. The bandits are portrayed from a distance; we don't get to know any of them (although we learn their motives - they are as hungry as the villagers).\n\nOne of the most intriguing sequences occurs as Kambei plans the defense of the village. Using a map of the environs, he explains how the enemy will likely approach and what he intends to do to impede them. By including this scene, Kurosawa ensures that we understand the layout of the village and the plans of the samurai, so that when the battle begins, we have an understanding of how landmarks relate to each other. James Cameron employs a similar approach in Titanic when, in the \"present\" sequences, he uses computer graphics to show what happened to the ship as it broke up so that, when we see it happen, we comprehend what is transpiring.\n\nIn many ways, Seven Samurai is defined by its style. Kurosawa doesn't just set marks and coach actors; he composes scenes. Despite its drawbacks (a lack of \"three dimensionality\"), he frequently uses the \"deep focus\" camera technique to keep everyone in focus, regardless of their distance from the lens. He rarely resorts to close-ups, and, when he does, there's a specific reason. His battle scenes are realistic, but not confusing. Whenever possible, he captures the seven samurai in the same shot. (This is emphasized at the end, when the survivors are shown in the same frame as the graves of the dead.) On more than one occasion, he shoots figures silhouetted against the horizon.\n\nOver the span of his career, Kurosawa made so many great films that it can be difficult to determine which is his best. For most critics, the finalists would be Rashomon and Seven Samurai - films with more differences than similarities. Rashomon is the more thought-provoking of the two, but Seven Samurai is a grand epic - a big, splashy motion picture that runs well over three hours and never flags. The intermission is almost superfluous; we are so caught up in the story that, by the time it arrives, it's more of a nuisance than a welcome break. Seven Samurai has the kind of momentum that many long movies lack. Despite its length, it is a perfect example of economy - there isn't a single wasted shot. Seven Samurai is his best.",

Despite being difficult to load and fire and notoriously unreliable, those weapons represent a significant advantage, and the samurai realize that the key to victory may be stealing at least one of the guns from their enemies. (Nearly all of the early significant casualties are the result of men being shot.)\r\n\r\nAlthough Seven Samurai is an ensemble picture, no star shines brighter than Kurosawa's favorite actor, Toshiro Mifune. His Kikuchiyo is larger-than-life. Mifune is given an opportunity to show his range here, playing a stumbling drunk; a playful clown who delights in the company of children; a dark, brooding man who reflects on his unhappy past; and a terrifying fighter who cannot be slowed or stopped. Veteran Takashi Shimura, another frequent Kurosawa collaborator, is the voice of wisdom, reason, and patience as Kambei. The actor presents his character as a man who commands respect through his mere presence. Kambei's coolness is in direct contrast with Kikuchiyo's flamboyance. The third major samurai is Katsushiro. Isao Kimura portrays him with a mixture of energy and naïveté, then blends in a growing sense of somber realization as he recognizes that battle is not all glory.\r\n\r\nOf the remaining four samurai, only Seiji Miyaguchi's Kyuzo stands out as memorable, primarily because he is so different from his fellows. Quiet and withdrawn, he is a serious individual who speaks primarily with his sword. Miyaguchi portrays him as an honorable, unsmiling loner. The other three are largely interchangeable until the third or fourth viewing of the film, when their personalities begin to emerge. Of the villagers, only Yoshio Tsuchiya's impulsive Rikichi, Kamatari Fujiwara's dour Manzo, and Keiko Tsushima's sultry Shino gain any real individuality. The bandits are portrayed from a distance; we don't get to know any of them (although we learn their motives - they are as hungry as the villagers).\r\n\r\nOne of the most intriguing sequences occurs as Kambei plans the defense of the village. Using a map of the environs, he explains how the enemy will likely approach and what he intends to do to impede them. By including this scene, Kurosawa ensures that we understand the layout of the village and the plans of the samurai, so that when the battle begins, we have an understanding of how landmarks relate to each other. James Cameron employs a similar approach in Titanic when, in the \"present\" sequences, he uses computer graphics to show what happened to the ship as it broke up so that, when we see it happen, we comprehend what is transpiring.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, Seven Samurai is defined by its style. Kurosawa doesn't just set marks and coach actors; he composes scenes. Despite its drawbacks (a lack of \"three dimensionality\"), he frequently uses the \"deep focus\" camera technique to keep everyone in focus, regardless of their distance from the lens. He rarely resorts to close-ups, and, when he does, there's a specific reason. His battle scenes are realistic, but not confusing. Whenever possible, he captures the seven samurai in the same shot. (This is emphasized at the end, when the survivors are shown in the same frame as the graves of the dead.) On more than one occasion, he shoots figures silhouetted against the horizon.\r\n\r\nOver the span of his career, Kurosawa made so many great films that it can be difficult to determine which is his best. For most critics, the finalists would be Rashomon and Seven Samurai - films with more differences than similarities. Rashomon is the more thought-provoking of the two, but Seven Samurai is a grand epic - a big, splashy motion picture that runs well over three hours and never flags. The intermission is almost superfluous; we are so caught up in the story that, by the time it arrives, it's more of a nuisance than a welcome break. Seven Samurai has the kind of momentum that many long movies lack. Despite its length, it is a perfect example of economy - there isn't a single wasted shot. Seven Samurai is his best.",

            "content": "The most popular cinematic export from Japan is inarguably the samurai movie. Whole books have been devoted to the genre, and more than one mail-order video business has made a tidy profit shipping samurai tapes and DVDs around the world. The most important samurai movie is Akira Kurosawa's 1954 feature, Seven Samurai, which not only impacted the way the genre was viewed, but elevated its status. Seven Samurai was influential not only in Japan and for foreign film enthusiasts, but it led to a popular and reasonably faithful remake, The Magnificent Seven. And, although Japanese critics during the '50s were dismissive of the picture, it has since achieved an almost mythical status and was recently selected by a group of '00 critics as the Best Japanese Movie of All-Time.\r\n\r\nCuriously, for a feature that is often viewed as the standard-bearer of the samurai movie, Seven Samurai is actually an atypical genre entry. An \"average\" samurai film focuses on a sword-wielding, superhero-type individual who battles his way through the story, often triumphing over a seemingly overwhelming host of foes. Seven Samurai offers us flawed protagonists, some of whom are not skilled fighters, and one of whom is often drunk, belligerent, and decidedly non-heroic in his approach. The odds are impressive, yet, in large part due to the melancholy tone adopted by Kurosawa during the closing scene, the victory is hollow, and almost feels like a defeat. (The lead samurai's final words: \"So. Again we are defeated. The farmers have won. Not us.\")\r\n\r\nSeven Samurai is richly deserving of its high place in cineaste circles. Despite its epic length and scope, the key to the movie's success is that it focuses on a small group of characters. (The actual number of fully realized individuals is three, not seven - several of the \"secondary\" samurai are only sketchily developed.) The narrative is straightforward, allowing numerous opportunities for elaborate action sequences. In fact, the bulk of the movie's second half is comprised of battle scenes. These are clearly delineated and exactingly choreographed. Kurosawa, a meticulous craftsman, does not rely on editing sleight-of-hand to present fights. His stylistic imprint is emblazoned upon every frame. (Seven Samurai was filmed with a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. For a sample of what Kurosawa accomplish in widescreen, check out some of his later films, starting with Hidden Fortress.)\r\n\r\nThose familiar with the narrative of The Magnificent Seven will recognize the storyline for Seven Samurai. In order to shoehorn Seven Samurai's 3 1/2 hours of material into The Magnificent Seven's two hours, condensation was mandated. Two of Seven Samurai's lead characters were combined to form a single individual in The Magnificent Seven. For the most part, however, the basics were left intact. After viewing American remake, Kurosawa reportedly remarked that he was pleased with the effort, going so far as to send a gift to filmmaker John Sturges, who helmed the 1960 feature.\r\n\r\nSeven Samurai tells the tale of a 16th century Japanese farm community that, led by a band of seven warriors, defends itself against a gang of pillaging robbers. When several of the village's men, lead by a hot-head named Rikichi (Yoshio Tsuchiya), grow weary of the annual raids of the bandits, they decide to act. Since the citizens do not have the martial ability or skill to fight, Rikichi seeks mercenary samurai who are willing to defend the settlement in return for food and lodging. The seven men who accompany Rikichi home are a diverse lot. They include the sage Kambei (Takashi Shimura), a great leader of men; Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), a burly clown whose prowess with a sword does not match his arrogance; Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi), a quiet master swordsman who lets his weapon speak for him; and young Katsushiro (Isao Kimura), who idolizes Shichiroji and Kambei. Also in the party are Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki), Shichiroji (Daisuke Kato), and Gorobei (Yoshio Inaba). After teaching the men of the town how to fight and preparing the village for its defense (building fences, flooding the rice fields, and tearing down a bridge), the seven samurai await the inevitable coming of the 40-odd bandits and the battle that will determine the peasants' future.\r\n\r\nThe film is divided into three sections. The first features the gathering of the protectors, as each samurai is given an introduction. Seven Samurai was the first film to use this approach; it has been copied often in the five decades since Kurosawa completed the movie. This portion of the picture is essentially set-up, but it's crucial to defining the characters and their relationships. The longest introduction belongs to Kikuchiyo, who initially appears as a drunken buffoon, then later proves to be more resourceful than any of his future companions expected.\r\n\r\nSeven Samurai's second segment encompasses the preparations for battle. During this portion of the film, the protectors are introduced to the farmers. In addition to fortifying the settlement and teaching the men how to use weapons, a form of bonding occurs. Kikuchiyo becomes a favorite of the village children, and they follow him around. Katsushiro begins a romance with a local girl, Shino (Keiko Tsushima), who willingly offers herself to the samurai despite the dishonor such a liaison would bring upon her and her family. Being in the village also brings back troubling memories for Kikuchiyo, whose past remains shrouded from his fellows.\r\n\r\nThe third section is the battle for the village, with the bandits attacking in waves. There's also a pre-emptive strike attempted by the samurai, who raid the bandits' camp before they ride to the village. The bandits have two advantages over their intended prey - they are mounted and they are in possession of three guns. Despite being difficult to load and fire and notoriously unreliable, those weapons represent a significant advantage, and the samurai realize that the key to victory may be stealing at least one of the guns from their enemies. (Nearly all of the early significant casualties are the result of men being shot.)\r\n\r\nAlthough Seven Samurai is an ensemble picture, no star shines brighter than Kurosawa's favorite actor, Toshiro Mifune.

Seven Samurai is an unforgettable masterpiece - the work of one of the world's greatest filmmakers at the height of his powers.",

With his international reputation on the rise, Kurosawa started work on a next film which took a year to shoot and nearly bankrupted the producers, but it succeeded. Set sometime in the 1500's, when Japan was divided into warring states, a group of bandits going around raiding villages. They come to one village, but their leader (Shinpei Takagi) decides to spare them until the harvest. Now worried for their lives, including farmer Manz? (Kamatari Fujiwara) and miller Gisaku (Kokuten Kodo) decide to employ seven masterless samurai to protect them. The samurai include Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), Shimada (Takashi Shimura), Okamoto (Isao Kimura), Katayama (Yoshio Inaba),  Ky?z? (Seiji Miyaguchi), Hayashida (Minoru Chiaki) and Shichir?ji (Daisuke Kat?), who all agree to help the villagers, but they have to adapt to their life first. It's a very simple plot, but it's spread over 3 hours, although it didn't need to be that long, and it's had loads of different versions. But within this film you can see the template and blueprints for how action films would be made in the years to come. It's not the classic people have made it out to be, but it's got some good moments.",

            "content": "\"What are we fighting for?\" Shut up, you hippie. Okay, hippies weren't as strong of a rage back then, but anti-war sentiments certainly exist. So, what went wrong in those past three sentences? There was an assumption made about the initial question, interpreting it as an anti-war sentiment. Seven Samurai is, so far, the only film I can think of that depicts a war in an encouraging manner, yet ultimately destroys the motives of every soldier in focus.\n\nSeven samurai and a village of farmers VERSUS an army of forty thieves. That's the ideal situation for the village, when they must face another year of thieves robbing everything that was harvested. What choice is left, but to hire samurai willing to fight for that cause with no reward other than a bowl of rice a day? Trouble is, not many samurai would fight for that reason. After several days of searching for willing fighters, seven are found. They each choose to fight for their individual, but not independent reasons. Kambei (Takashi Shimura) is the first to join, and acts as the primary war strategist. He has fought many wars and is no longer interested in gaining reputation. He loves to fight for greater balance and justice in the world. His adoring fan Katsushiro (K.O.), a new samurai, is eager to learn about what fighting in a war is like. Shichiroji (Daisuke Kato), friend and fellow fighter to Kambei, is simply happy to fight alongside great companions, old and new. Gorobei (Yoshio Inaba) is so intrigued by Kambei's mindset that he feels like he can put wisdom and faith into Kambei's leadership. Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki) is a woodcutter in need of any meal on the table, and, for such, is happy to help others in any way that he can. Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi) is a master of the sword who longs to continue practicing his skills in whatever situation may call for a master. Lastly, there is Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune). Before explaining his motive, I must note that, while the ensemble acting is already stellar, Mifune still happens to steal the show. Kikuchiyo is both the primary comic relief and holds the most dramatic monologues and backstories, and Mifune commits to every action with such fun and passion. His motive is to avenge the lives of farmers who lost their lives to bandits, and annihilate every single thief in sight.\n\nSPOILER: If Japanese martial arts cinema weren't so obscure to Americans at its time of release, I bet that the final quote of the movie, \"The farmers have won. We have lost,\" would have resonated with common viewers. Truly, every single samurai lost. No one lived up to their motive. Heihachi died in the attempt to save a farmer from sacrificing his life. Gorobei died because of his faith in the mission, granted under the control of a great militaristic strategist. Kyuzo died by distant gunshot, thus not allowing him any means of proving his mastery. Kikuchiyo died under the pretense that he has slain the final thief, which only we, the viewers, see is false. The other three samurai live. Katsushiro discovers that with war comes love, and even after surviving war, that love can die. Seeing the rejection in his eyes in the epilogue is rather painful. Shichiroji cannot conjure enthusiasm for their victory, when staring at the four graves of befallen samurai. And Kambei, throughout the entire movie, uncovers injustices on all sides of the fight, and concludes that there is no way he can ever fix the world. In the meantime, however, the farmers saved their village. I do not mean to disregard a good chunk of this three-and-a-half-hours long movie. Trust me, every second is worth your time. However, the final hour is the ultimate Kurosawa achievement, shooting remarkable, exciting and horrifying war scenes and splicing them with provocative dialogue to spark discussion at any second.\n\nYou might be surprised to hear that such a long movie stands out for its pacing, but I thought it moved at a good pace. This sprawling war movie does not sell itself as action-packed, so we are free to involve ourselves with the desperate affairs of the farmers. This doesn't just regard thieves. They fear the samurai as well, on account of their reputation for looting, pillaging, even killing innocent bystanders. Under-the-surface tension between two characters can be strong, and Kurosawa shows that so can such tension between two crowds. The farmers take it out on themselves before the samurai, yet their fears all come from outside influence. By the end, it's clear that the farmers only love each other. Once there is cooperation, I found myself quite interested in the preparation for war. Viewers are welcome to familiarizing with the whole map of the area -- on one end are empty, flat fields, surrounded by a moat; on the other end is a forest pathway leading up a mountain. Meanwhile, we learn a greater deal about what \"unity\" means to individual farmers, as each procedural step reveals something new about particular village members. This is best signified by the choice of Grandaddy (Kuninori Kodo), the all-purpose guru of the town, to die in his inevitably unprotected mill. At the last minute, his family members leave the protected village to join him, only to have to evacuate because of a raid. The samurai do what they feel they have to do in that situation, but are constantly at risk of completely reshaping their motives because of the foreign motives of the farmers.\n\n\"What are we fighting for?\" Each character must ask themselves this again and again and again. There is no consistent answer, and even when they thought they understood why, every action somehow led to failure. The victory of the farmers did not matter. At the declaration of the last thief (ahem) being dead, all that we see and hear is Katsushiro hysterically crying, unable to feel relieved by such news. It's not like Kambei's plans failed. They were quite successful, and happened to act as classic cinematic action. Katsushiro learns what war is like: inevitable despair. Kurosawa twists that despair into tension, between like characters and between opposing groups. Scenes and conversations are held on for a perfect amount of time to let that tension pull you around. Why resist?",

I have always wanted to see this movie, and I have only just gotten around to seeing it.  I was blown away by this influential masterpiece from Kurosawa.  Every aspect of the film was perfect.  The character development, rich and complex gave personality to all seven of the samurai.  Even the villagers like Rikichi were developed in such a way that makes the viewer really empathize with them.  The script was witty, yet sensitive and poignant and the cinematography was breathtaking.  I especially enjoyed the scene when Kyuzo emerged with a stolen musket in thick fog.  The icing on the cake are the battle scenes.  After watching Seven Samurai it is easy to see why it is one of the most influential movies in cinematic history.  For any movie fan, Kurosawa's masterpiece is a must see.",

There's a sweeping storyline, great characters, moments of hilarious humor, epic battle scenes, sprinklings of drama, shocking reveals, love, loss, and so much more. It's a film that has definitely earned its reputation as the classic it is, but I was even more impressed by it since it gave me so much more than that as well.

It connects you to the characters(all of the samurai and even one or two of the villagers are very enduring), and expects you to to follow their(absolutely legitimate) heroism, but then it makes you question the point of it all. You question the value of the villagers, the value of the samurai to the villagers, and the value of the lifestyle these people live in. I won't claim to know what Kurosawa was trying to say with certitude(although I  have some half-assed theories), but it is undeniable that he is trying to make a point about the class system, and the value of social responsibility. These themes aside, the action is perfectly paced, well thought out, believable(villagers fight differently than samurai, and it is clearly planned and executed amazingly), and gorgeous to watch. The two lead actors are on their game, as well as most of the other samurai. The scenery is beautiful. The depth of field and style of the sets makes the cinematography incredibly interesting. I guess my point is, \"Well done, Kurosawa. Well-fucking-done\".",

Yet these qualities are essential to it as it serves as a paradigm of Japanese Period Drama Cinema.\n\nFrankly, Seven Samurai isn't just a masterpiece, its very ahead of its time. Considering the single-handed undertaking that director Akira Kurosawa took with creating it which was the biggest single undertaking for any Japanese filmmaker at the time, an Academy Award for Best Director is due to him. I mean, when a filmmaker's debut film is as much of a masterpiece as Seven Samurai, an Oscar is surely in order. Akin Kurosawa gives excellent directional work to Seven Samurai and ensures its well shot with great cinematography and beautiful locations, as well as strongly choreographed and entertaining action scenes which set the standard for films to have a basis for in the future. Seven Samurai is so strong with an excellently original plot and great characters that it has become one of the most influential films ever made, with its influence spreading as far as the western film The Magnificent Seven and even to the animated film A Bug's Life. Seven Samurai set a new standard for the world of cinema, and its even benefitted by a great musical score, a great script with an excellent exploration of themes matched with a sense of light comedy mixed with serious drama, and an iconic final shot. The final shot in Seven Samurai is one of the single greatest in cinematic history, as Kambei and Shichiroji reflect on the true winners of the situation, and a shot showing the graves of 4 fallen comrades meets the sky at the top of a hill. This is a powerfully emotional scene, one that's unforgettable, and the one that turns my review of Seven Samurai from 4 stars into 4.5, as its one of the few films which can redeem so much with a perfect finale, like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. \nSeven Samurai is an unforgettable masterpiece of Japanese cinema, and its actors keep it good while the action keeps it stimulating even through a more than 3 hour journey in Japanese.",

            "content": "Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is considered a classic of Japanese cinema and has spawned many American copies, such as The Magnificant Seven and A Bugs Life. But how does this 1954 movie hold up today? Quite well actually. For its ¬length (over 3 hours) and place at the beginning of Japanese cinema, Seven Samurai has an engaging plot, unique characters and genuine moments of tragedy, comedy, and tension.\n\tSeven Samurai has the plot of a film you've seen before. It's spawned so many clones, that it's nice to see the original in all its glory. That being said, it's not perfect. The films pacing is rather uneven, with the first act moving at a very quick pace, which was refreshing until the second act started dragging on way too slowly. The films length definitely is correlated to this and maybe if some cutting had been done to that second act, a more compressed and smooth story could have been created. That's not to say that the second act is bad, it still upholds the good writing and acting the other two have, but it just slows down to concentrate on various smaller issues. Great for character development, but not as necessary as it one might think.\n\tThe titular seven samurai are all unique characters, with solid performances backing them up. You'll never get confused as to which samurai is which, even if you'll never remember their names. The villagers are rather interesting too, in that they aren't played up as the helpless, innocent victims. To the contrary, Kurosawa portrays them as human to a fault, selfishly trying to keep what they have, even if it means betraying their protectors. This fascinating dynamic between them and the samurai and how it changes is a highlight of the movie\n\tKurosawa's brilliant directing is truly something to behold, and way beyond its time. The way he shoots action, comedy, and the haunting ending scene are all extremely effective. A lot of older movies, especially foreign ones, loose their effectiveness when watched today because it feels so distant. Kurosawa's comedy is funny, particularly the scene with the horse. His action is exciting and nowhere nearly as confusing as the post-Transformers action sequences of today. In fact his use of different frame rates to either speed up the action or slow down the dramatic deaths is really effective and not as cheesy as one would think. His drama is very real; as he sets the mood well and with his strong actors delivers true heartbreaking moments. He's also not afraid to let you be confused, as there are a few scenes where you really sit there wondering what's going on, just like the characters are, until it's finally explained to you.\n\tThe hardest thing for someone going into this film is the cultural difference. The names are hard to remember, there are references to things you won't know, and a lot of the history involved that just won't make sense. It's the side effect of being a westerner, but try and keep an open mind. As you watch the movie, you begin to understand how this world works, just with any other movie and soon you're just as immersed as with the latest blockbuster.\n\tI saw this film on VHS and you know what... it wasn't that bad. The subbing was ok, even if it wasn't present for every line and I didn't feel like I was missing anything because... I wasn't. This film isn't widescreen so don't bother looking for a copy like that. I wouldn't recommend pirating this movie, as it truly deserves a non-pixilated watching. If you can get this on Blu-Ray or DVD because it's totally worth it, and you will want to show this classic to everyone you know. If you can get past the length, and the very nature of the film being a 50s Japanese movie, then you should have a remarkable viewing experience ahead of you.\ngo to mentalmultiverse.wordpress.com for more reviews",

            "content": "Seven Samurai is often categorized as the catalyst of Samurai films and that titled is well preserved since it release. It's not only an important piece of filmmaking in Asia, but in filmmaking in general. Its influence can still be seen today. It's one of the quintessential films of cinema very few can match in terms of importance and quality.\r\n\r\nSeven Samurai is about a poor village attempting to recruit seven unemployed samurai to help them defend themselves against the attacking bandits. The plot of Seven Samurai was among the first to introduced several plot structural elements that are still used even to this day. The recruitment and gathering of heroes towards a specific goal, introducing the main hero with an undertaking unrelated to the main plot, a reluctant hero, romance between a local girl and the youngest hero, and the nervousness of the common citizens. Others film since it release have used these common plot devices, but \"Seven Samurai\" was among the first to combined them all. Yes it makes the film overly familiar yet despite how many times we have seen these specific plot elements \"Seven Samurai\" remains timeless. \r\n\r\nIn terms of writing \"Seven Samurai\" is one of few films that remains flawless and unmatched. It gradually develops the villagers and the samurai with such a profound depth. The villagers are among most dynamic exploring the common social class fearing the way and culture of the Samurai. Opposing at first due to their social status fearing for their livelihood if the Samurai will abuse and take advantage of them in their weak position. Debating the negatives and positives with either decision they choose go with. This simple dilemma in other films would have had a clear answer, but here there's allot more to it than wrong and right. Consequences and reward of such an action is debated until the villagers ultimately come to term accepting to go with the enemy they hate least. Scenes like this makes the village come to life and make you feel like you hold importance in the community. You'll end up wanting for everyone to make it out alive, but know such an outcome is inevitable making it even more compelling and heightens the tension. \r\n\r\nEven more impressive is how every Samurai is three dimensional. Each having their own distinctive characteristic, their own motivations, their own morals, and their past. What bounds these Samurai together is their code. A code that has been thrust onto to them by society to performs the duty they are given. Bounded together to preserve a tradition that no matter the reward must help those in need. A code that the film is not afraid to challenge on several occasions. Like if it's honorable for a Samurai to work for the simple reward of being fed? Should a Samurai cut of his symbolic hairstyle showing his status to help aid a single person? If a warrior has experienced many battles does it necessarily mean he won any of them? It's not afraid to touch upon the Samurai culture in a negative light doing so without demonizing them nor moralizing the complex dilemma they face.\r\n\r\nThe bandits which are the villain of the film are never given a clear face. Alluding that evil has no common face, but is all common with reasoning behind their actions. The bandits aren't necessarily evil just for the sake of being cruel. They have no jobs, own no land, and divided among the rest of the world for their own lifestyle they adapted for survival. Hence why the introduction of these bandits is not a barbaric one showing the bandits attacking a village, but rather through dialogue as the bandits declare they will take another village resources for living. If we were to see the bandits of \"Seven Samurai\" commit a crime for our introduction they would have been no difference from your average antagonist. Leaving little or no impression upon the viewer lessening ideals presented in conflict. This demonstrates that despite their barbaric nature the bandits still carry common traits working together as a society to survive by all means. One could even say the villagers and the bandits are no different from each other.\r\n\r\nThe ending is also one worth touching upon. It's an ending so perfect that it rivals the like of \"Casablanca\" as one of the greatest ending ever filmed. The ending best personifies our heroes honor and the villagers view on the Samurai. Throughout their entire endeavors the Samurai turmoils and internal conflicts can be presented in this one scene. On looking on the aftermath of the experience. Losing the war despite winning so many battles and ultimately for no fame, no fortune, but because of their code of life bound to them. Teaching those who serve for the greater good in the end might not be rewarded for their good deed and even be forgotten no matter the size of the deed committed. \r\n\r\nAkira Kurosawa hits all the right note with his masterful direction. Not once is the viewer ever lost in its complicated narrative under Kurosawa direction. He uses landscapes to create atmosphere going from a peaceful mood to states of depression letting no single image go to waste. The film battle scenes serve an equally dramatic purpose not just simply being a form of spectacles. Kurosawa highlights the pain and misery of excessive violence on reverse of heroism. In all the scenes of people running, the camera seems to speed up also to kick up the film's adrenaline. Kurosawa also help pioneered the use of slow motion in some scenes to underscore the moment brilliantly orchestrating the flow of the action. Fumio Hayasaka scores manages to capture the diversity of tones in Kurosawa's narrative sweeping you away with emotion with every note you hear.\r\n\r\nIn terms of acting you'll be hard pressed to find a single weak link. The actors in this film were outstanding as they each brought their character to life in an unbelievable way, as they delivered different humorous moments, exciting and gripping sequences and some very touching and emotional scenes. Of all the actor Toshiro Mifune is easily the standout among an all star cast with his oddball personality and huge dramatic change through the course of the film. Mifune accomplished no easy feat in film filled with numerous excellent actors and performances.\r\n\r\nSeven Samurai is without a shed of doubt one of the greatest films ever made. It's more than tale of good versus evil, it's more than a epic, and it's more than a classic. \"Seven Samurai\" is a piece of filmmaking that forever changed it landscape, continue to serves as an inspiration for filmmakers to this day, and a film that holds many interpretation discovering a new meaning with every viewing.",

The characters are all fun and everyone will have their favorite pick. You truly care for the lives and safety of the characters. The action scenes are still breath-taking today and suspenseful. The four hours pass as if the movie was 20 minutes long. The plot is simple and easy to follow, but is nevertheless layered and filled with messages. Kurosawa's direction is so effective that you let yourself get lost in the film. I really enjoyed how it did not just show the farmers as helpless victims. At the end of the day, they use the farmers for their own protection and might even forget about them. It is the only action film I have ever scene that contains energy, excitement, and more depth than Oscar- winning dramas. \"Seven Samurai\" is an epic tale of selflessness as the biggest sacrifice with fun characters and an amusing story with a message.",

He developed characters we came to care for, gave us gritty scenes of violence, and gave us a look at the hard life of farmers. Each of the seven samurai is given a characteristic for which we love them. With Kikuchiyo (play with feverish energy by Toshiro Mifune) we love his courage, occasional wisdom, while overlooking his hotheadedness, and sporabic fits of insanity. Perhaps some of us see some of ourselves in his tortured character who is often striving to try and prove himself. I know I have on occasion jumped into a situation before thinking through the consequences, and Kikychiyo tends to do it to during the course of the film. But his mistakes tend to be larger and the consequences often cost his friends their lives. There are many other likable characters in this film, but I think the true triumph of this film is the humanity of it. We see how the higher class, be it Samurai or bandit, assume to treat the lower class, in this instance the farmers. We see the similarities between them and the differences. While this film may be long, depending on which version you watch (I strongly recommend the 207 minutes long version), it is an excellent film, which you will enjoy whether you prefer drama, or comedy, or action, or just films in general.",

An epic tale of an endengared village by Bandits, and How \"7 samurai\" teached the villagers  to stand and fight their own battles; and how to have hope and never to surrender.",

What a great story of men rallying together for a common cause. The film is very engrossing and not once throughout did I find myself looking at the clock. It didn't feel like a long film at all, before I knew it the film was over and I felt as if I had just been on a great adventure with these great warriors, who sacrificed it all for the lesser man.",

Un film influyente en todos los sentidos para el genero, pero a mi juicio, no creo que ningún film haya podido superar (Tal vez cerca le ande, pero nunca llega a ese nivel superlativo). Para la época es una película revolucionaria; escenas de acción que quitan el aliento, una narración que te construyen de manera perfecta por dos horas, para que el maestro te brinde un clímax bestial, trágico, emotivo, dramático y nostálgico. Una joya del cine medieval-épico y de la historia del cine en general.",

This is a movie that truly stands the test of time, it's not only a fantastic movie in it's own right but one that will continue to inspire others like it for generations. It's a movie with mainly two subplots. One being the questioning or rebelling against tradition, that even those born from common beginnings can still achieve greatness. The second being the romantic love affair between Katsushiro (played by Isao Kimura) and a local village girl. A farmer's daughter cannot marry a ronin for some reason and when they are found together the father protests, however there are arguments in the village to understand the young ones and an appeal to let their romance continue, an appeal designed for the audiences when the movie came out and unlikely to have mattered much in the 1600s when the movie is set. Though many of the Samurai die i feel the movie is not just about violence and action, but about the willingness to stand for change, to not just abide by the social norm and most importantly one's duty to do whats right. The ideals of this movie i will always remember, and the movie itself i will always cherish.",
