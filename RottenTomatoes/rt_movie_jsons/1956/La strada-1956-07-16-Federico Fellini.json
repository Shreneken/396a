Soon Zampan\u00f2 must deal with his jealousy and conflicted feelings about Gelsomina when she finds a kindred spirit in Il Matto (Richard Basehart), the carefree circus fool, and contemplates leaving Zampan\u00f2.",

A sad take on the beauty and the beast trope, with good performances and the beginning ingredients of what they call fellini-esqe films. And Giulietta Masina is wonderful.",

Together, they travel the Italian countryside, scrounging to make ends meet and struggling to come to terms with their volatile relationship.  It is an often beautiful and sometimes ugly examination of the meaning of being, filled with striking images, a touching score, and a strong performance from Quinn.  Some will find Masina's performance overbearing at times, but she effectively captures the innocent nature of her character.  The final shot of Zampano on the beach coming to terms with his lot in life is nothing if not memorable.",

            "content": "From the first moment of the first scene I could tell this was something of quality, I have no idea how but I just could and overall this film is of high quality. It is also very Italian - intense passion, crude roughness and culture all rolled into one - Italy in a nutshell. Unfortunately for me the film was ruined by one thing and that is completely and utterly ruined beyond redemption and that thing was Gelsomina and her acting. The character appeared to have no depth or meaning whatsoever and are we supposed to find her amusing just because she makes funny faces and walks in a funny way. I need a bit more to a character than expression and gait and spent the whole film thinking someone should have really told her that she isn't Charlie Chaplin. She irritated me utterly. I tried to enjoy other parts of the film, which were good but just couldn't because I had to look at her, even when they appeared to be developing another aspect of the film it would then cut to a close up of her making some expression as though completely unaware that we had to watch these painful, over-acted, unnatural contortions, there was no escape. The truest line in the whole film was when she was told she had a face like an artichoke. I actually quite liked the other characters, Zampano included, not that maybe I liked them as people but as characters, cliched admittedly but at least they seemed to have some sort of meaning and authenticity about them and the fool even have something useful to say. They could have done Gelsomina so much better - either the oppressed woman powerless and basically sold into slavery, or the trapped women escaped to take on the free life of a gypsy rover; as it happened they tried both, did neither and any attempt was usually cut short by having to look at her funny faces and ridiculous gait. I don't know much about Chaplin but there must be something about him though I do wonder if this style is better left to silent cinema. All this combined with how they tried to develop the other characters both as individuals and as archetypes meant perhaps this film was trying to do too much which is in credit to its makers and of interest to professional critics and film students but to me just made it unenjoyable. It was a good premise and if they had done more in a Saragossa type style this could have been an 8/9/10 out of 10 film. As it was: 6/10",

History has chosen this film as one of the premier representatives of a classic dynamic, the innocent youth and the jaded pragmatist. Here, they are each treated with a sense of morbid tragedy, as the former lacks self-sufficiency and the latter is doomed to dissatisfaction and self-loathing. The two leads are exceptionally well-suited to their respective roles, with Masina exuding a wide-eyed naivet\u00e9 while Quinn brings forth surprising depth from his role, displaying at various points cold indifference, covetousness, and ultimately a consuming regret that forces him to recognize his own cruel nature. Those searching for the layers of subtext that Fellini interjects into his work so often will have a field day with this one, as the simplicity of its overall narrative allows for endless interpretation. More conventionally structured than his later films, La Strada shows the director/writer's strengths in pulling from personal experience to tug the heartstrings. (4/5)",

A slightly retarted girl is sold to an entertainer that drifts around streets looking for small crowds to impress people with his iron breaking trick. Gelsomina is not treated nicely as his assistant and she have more downs than ups during her time with Zampan\u00f2. When they come to a circus she meets up with a guy she has seen perform before. \"The Fool\" is very gifted and she likes this man way more than her companion. Naturally the two men argue and she is left pretty sad wondering what to do. People are always treating her bad and she kind of stick up with it - she does not know any better.\n\nThis film starts of pretty flat and boring. There is not much of a plot other than the things I mention, but something big happen after the first hour plus or so. This is when the film really gets better for me and I find it easier to enjoy this semi-bizarre film for it's qualities.\n\nFellini is not one of my favorites, but the three or four I have seen before this one has been good or great. This one is for me somewhere in the middle. I find it a bit overrated and very dated. Some cool transitions, some great shots, but a story with late development and to much repetition in a way - it feels dragged. As a whole and a total it helps a lot with the last 30 minutes or so, where both the characters and the movie change. At also stayed with me for a while - so you can say it's a grower. A good thing.\n\n7.5 out of 10 iron pieces stronger than steel.",

I can\u2019t say that I was ever bored or disengaged by the plot. Yet the film is painful because it\u2019s so hard to watch the struggles of the main character. She is so badly mistreated in every definition of the word, that I can\u2019t help empathizing with her. There are brief moments of lightness and gaiety, but oppression feels like it is always right around the corner. I know there are others who can watch this kind of film and appreciate the authentic realization of the human experience, and I can see why La Strada would be lauded for that accomplishment. I\u2019m simply not built to handle a film where the protagonist is constantly suffering. Also, as I mentioned in my review of A Streetcar Named Desire, this isn\u2019t the time in my life when I can find any entertainment in an abusive relationship. That being said, I still applaud the quality of La Strada. It is a well-constructed film and it has many elements that I\u2019d call great. Sadly, the whole package isn\u2019t appealing to me. ",

La Strada is exactly that kind of movie. A brutish circus strongman takes on a faintly dimwitted woman-child. Neither of them are mental geniuses; no hyper-literate Aaron Sorkin rants here. But the basic universal themes of humanity run strong - the need for affection, security, respect, loyalty.\n\nLa Strada was Fellini's first break from the Neo-Realism that had dominated post-war Italian cinema. Zampano, Gelsomina and The Fool are not Everymen. They are dell'arte-ish archetypes thrust into a sad quest for survival in a poverty-stricken land. \n\nIn fact, if you watch this movie as a realistic portrayal of events, it will lose you from the opening scene. Gelsomina, the woman-child, comes home to find that her older sister has died in the slavery/employ of some brutish circus beast, the circumstances of her sister's death come with no explanation, and that she has been sold into similar slavery/employ of this same brutish circus beast. So right away, we have a handful of grievous moral problems that are never addressed in this movie. This is just the life these people lead, and no one questions it. Hopefully this is not a real world in which people actually live. It is more comforting to view it metaphorically.\n\nGiulietta Masina's performance is often compared to Chaplin, but I saw her much more as Harpo Marx, her clear, expressive face incapable of masking her moods, the picture of innocence, always reacting with utter honesty.\n\nIt was also interesting to see Richard Basehart, whom I only really had ever seen as the lead stiff in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, play such a lighthearted, effusive character.",

The movie moves around these three characters, although it does not leverage the filmography to explain or provide anything about them. Compare this, for example, with Bergman's masterpiece \"The silence\".\nThe only thing I can give credit to in La Strada is the depiction of the drama between brutish Zampano and naive Gelsomina. Denied several times by Zampano, a man without any ethical or humanitarian value. The movie depicts how the simplicity of Gelsomina forms gradually the affection in Zampano which eventually changes him for the better.",

Along the way they meet The Fool, Quinn's old rival, who will offer Masina more than Quinn could. The acting here is as good as it gets and Quinn as Zampano. \"The fool is hurt\".

A really pit that I can't stand the naivety and numb nature of her Gelsomina because Anthony Quinn who plays the other leading character is plain awesome.\nHis Zampano is one of the greatest film characters I've seen on screen ever. Almost like a character from a Kurosawa film, he's both funny and brutal and right until the end we never exactly know if he's actually a good guy inside or why he just doesn't abandon Gelsomina.\n\nMuch of La Strada is a mystery, but the loose ends are, what it's essentially about. It's neither a melodrama nor a really character study, but just an excerpt of life, of a brute artist and a poor young girl who goes along with him for a certain distance. There's no tragic or happy ending, it just ends when their ways split again. I guess this is what life really looks like (at least more than Hollywood melodrama), the other thing is if I desire to watch a film about it.\nIf it has characters like Zampano, yes, give me more of it. With characters like Gelsomina I can live without these kind of films. La Strada, in the process, is somewhere in the middle - one brilliant character, an offbeat story but some very annoying details and of course Gelsomina as the big deal breaker.\n\nNevertheless, La Strada gets the old-master-bonus (which is the reason why I watched it in the first place) and you just have to acknowledge and admire Fellini's ability to play with comedy set pieces in this rather serious film.\nAlso, from what I've read, this is his most personal film and with some effort you can see references to his own life.",

The story is simple; daily existence for survival in a universe that does not care. The film suspends the viewer between the action of its characters and their stark environment and owes much to the black and white cinematographic technique of Otello Martelli and Carlo Carlini. Two scenes were particularly memorable to me; the first being the vast stretch of wind blasted wasteland surrounding the empty road as the two main characters, Gelsomina and Zampano, travel in their crazy motor caravan and the final scene with Zampano looking up from his drunken stupor on the sandy beach and recognizing the stars in the night sky for the first time but finding no place among them. This last scene is symbolic of man's separateness from the universe and his insignificance in it conveys more metaphysical horror than all of Bergman's films combined.",

            "content": "A KVIFF screen of Fellini's black and white classic LA STRADA.\n\nFirst I must refresh my memory to gather all the Fellini's I have watched so far. from 8 AND A HALF (1963, a 9/10), LA DOLCE VITA (1960, a 9/10) to AMARCORD (1973, a 8/10), so LA STRADA is the fourth one. The film has a direct exertion of pathos by coupling two disparate characters, an angelically miserable Gelsomina (Masina) and an uncivilised macho Zampan\u00c3\u00b2 (Quinn), which may not pander to the New Wave trend at that time, but time proves its longevity and flags the upcoming career flourish which would verify Fellini as one of the most creative and intelligent film auteur in an historical scope. \n\nLA STRADA has a starkly primitive settings for the always-on-the-wheel couple, the gypsyish, footloose lifestyle seems to be endless and bleak along with the melancholic tunes, Gelsomina\u00e2(TM)s hapless experience could melt any steel heart and her wide-eyed subservience is too heart-rending to even blame her; Zampan\u00c3\u00b2, on another level, is a far cry from an evil soul, merely is a man with rudimentary desires and an irascible temper. \n\n Giulietta Masina did an almost-perfect work to embody herself with all the ups-and-downs of a poor girl\u00e2(TM)s misadventure both inwards and outwards, her Chaplin-esque clown mimicry and antics have a genuine comedic infusion to the views and by comparison, Quinn\u00e2(TM)s chest chain-snapping stunt is over-used and outdated, but he has his own time, namely, the scenes of his final wail of grief are the salvation for him (a great solace for the audiences as well). Richard Basehart, his portrayal of \u00e2Il Matto\u00e2? is queerly vivacious, a sincere contrast to the adversity he would meet in due course. \n\nThe cameras work miracles too, for example, the night shots of tightrope-walking among crowds has its enchanting depth of focus. Although the world in LA STRADA is a period I could never experience, and it is a more straightforward tale compared with Fellini\u00e2(TM)s other oeuvres, but through the film I could potently sense a clear-minded manifesting of some most precious humility virtues which would also affect people under whatever conditions, to use a tear-jerking story to give hope, which is a marvelous achievement!",

            "content": "Federico Fellini was an undeniably strange and quirky filmmaker both in his work and his image he presented to the world. So it almost seems natural that of all the films he wrote and directed this one has the characters he claims he can relate the most too. He based the character of Zampano on a man who worked in castrating pigs in his hometown of Rimini, the man supposedly got around with the local woman and got a mentally deficient peasant girl pregnant before leaving town and her to her fate. Meanwhile the film's co-writer Tullio Peninelli had wanted to write a similar screenplay after seeing a man and a woman traveling alone by wagon through the mountains, wanting to tell their life on the harsh road. So the two were merged and La Strada was born, filmed in various locations throughout Italy, winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and being cited by Fellini as the film he felt the closest too. Though perhaps an obscure part of world cinema the film has made a mark in the musical world as well being cited as an influence and inspiration for Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", and the Kris Kristofferson penned hit \"Me and Bobby McGee.\" So many years later how does La Strada really hold up though? A moving work or pretentious fluff? Let's take destined to die young look.\r\n\r\nOur film is about brutish Zampano (Anthony Quinn, a really effective career defining performance and one often unfairly overlooked) a traveling circus strongman with a shady past who after buying a girl named Rosa for his assistant has returned to her hometown a year later with Rosa dead to buy her sister Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife who gives an equally moving but far different performance). Though she is a simple peasant girl suspected of having problems in the mind her mother accepts some money and sends Gelsomina on the road with Zampano to present and be a part of his act. Gelsomina has a childlike personality and though she is happy and curious at first quickly grows miserable with Zampano a horrible drunk and womanizer. She finds herself strangely attached to him however amidst all the trials of their relationship and the life they lead including being kicked out of a circus, encountering sad lonely people and eventually a horrible murder to terrible to handle.\r\n\r\nWhat really amazes me about this movie is how fucking tragic it is, I mean there is nothing bittersweet or know hard lessons learned or anything at the end of this film it just cuts out on a world of bleak and utter despair. It's hardly the first tragedy but the heartbreaking destitute ending is certainly ballsy at a time where Hollywood was still making such upbeat optimistic films. As with a lot of Fellini's film the directing is excellent and top notch for its day, but though it has some strange imagery its much more rooted in terra firma than a lot of his other films lacking that dreamlike quality and in many ways making it a perfect starting point for Fellini newcomers. The performances main and supporting are all incredibly effective, especially Quinn who I'd argue gives the central performance and is especially incredible as Italian is not his first language. The story meanwhile is masterfully structured, La Strada is translated in English to the road and this movie effectively documents the trials and tribulations of a base, talentless one trick pony and his unfortunate and far too curious and big hearted assistant as the road and vagabond lifestyle breaks them down physically and emotionally until they are no more and than claims them body and soul. Perhaps a bit too late to be considered truly timely or relevant La Strada is still an effective and resonant story that can be related to all willing to give it a try and offers a glimpse into a world unfamiliar to American audiences than and now.\r\n\r\nI loved La Strada, I think it's a really underrated masterpiece and it may not be the best but it remains my favorite Fellini film I've seen. I could find hardly a flaw in the entire film and it didn't feel dated in story or film-making in the slightest I found myself incredibly drawn into the whole well put together affair. Whether a fan of Italian cinema, Fellini in general or just plan movies I see no reason not to enjoy it and can't recommend the film highly enough if nothing else than for screen legend Anthony Quinn's greatest performance as Zampano and the gut wrenching incredibly moving ending. I can perhaps imagine the type of person this just wouldn't work for but I wouldn't want to be friends with them.",

It's the pretension of those future works that annoys me more than this one specifically: Fellini shows signs of talent here, and he eventually ripened as a director, and, yes, for the 1950s, this is pretty outstanding.  I've simply far exceeded my tolerance for the stupider siblings of this kind of work.  It's worth remembering that film is a medium; having actors do and say things that no one cares about for two hours does not demonstrate mastery of the medium.  Shock, depth, vividness, boldness, integrity, and rounded skill are not achieved through sophomoric scripted trifles masquerading as thought-provoking moments.  Also, every good movie starts with a good script, but the script is not the end of production.  For a complete guide to proper moviemaking, see \"Godfather\" and \"Godfather II.\"",

She learns that her older sister has died, and that she must take her place as assistant to the gruff, brutish Zampano (Anthony Quinn), a street performer who presents one simple trick that has gone utterly stale, but makes a living and that's all he cares about. While on the road, Zampano treats Gelsomina like dirt, yet they grow an attachment which only becomes apparent when it is too late. I adore this film's cinematography, which possesses some sort of greatness that I can't put my finger on. The acting is superb, Masina with her adorable facial expressions and naively optimistic manner, Quinn with his uptight, ape-like personality which is notoriously mocked by Richard Baseheart, \"The Fool\".

It's not a road movie in the American vein, young people finding freedom and the big expanse of life. But it is a story of carnival performers on the road, and we see the landscape all over post-war Italy.If you haven't seen Italian movies from this period, or any other Fellini, you might have to adjust to a couple things. One is a lack of totally clear plot. It does make sense, but it will jump along in little episodes that seem incidental. I think what this means is that the important things in life are incidental, and that it brings the viewer into the ordinary flow of these two or three lives. There is a touch of surrealism now and then, which adds to the strange feeling. The photography is simple but beautiful enough, and the scenery, every changing, adds to the sense that we are sweeping across a whole time to capture it and make it cohesive. The sound is odd, all dubbed in later (voices and musicians playing instruments, everything), and it is so obviously out of synch it again makes the experience dreamlike and bizarre. If you can't get used to that you might just write it off as low-budget.\nOf course, avoiding the main point until the end, this is a movie that gets into your heart. It's about a mean man and a sweet submissive girl who ends up being his wife, by default. Neither is a paradigm of movie beauty--Anthony Quinn at his roughest as Zampano, a circus strong man, and Giulietta Masina a tiny Gelsomina with a mime-like face that makes her the sad clown of the movie, very sympathetic. By the end, when Zampano is still seemingly unredeemable, we follow his every move and every twitch on his face because we are drawn into the tragedy of his life, even though it seemed avoidable all along. He's just that uncouth, untamed kind of man, and as much as he deserved to be made fun of (as another character does), he receives the empathy of Gelsomina.If you can step into the style and go with the odd flow of the scenes, you might find this a flawless film. Sometimes the best art is idiosyncratic, as this is. There are no inconsistencies, the feeling of the movie evolves and is fully grasped all through, and we are allowed to watch with wonder and understanding. Because we have seen these people before, in parts, and in ourselves. That's why it matters.",

Sweet and naive Gelsomina (Masina) is born in a poor family, and in a desperate attempt to get ten-thousand lire, her mother sells her to rough circus performer Zampan\u00f2 (Quinn). Gelsomina hates him, but she enjoys the circus life, and appreciates all that her owner has taught her. When the two are picked up by a bigger deal circus, Gelsomina meets Il Matto (The Fool) (Basehart) and after a few meetings, she falls for him. Too bad the triangle brings doom for the three. \"La Strada\" is one of Fellini's masterpieces, and since I prefer his black-and-white '50's films to his strange '60's and later surrealist movies, I knew I had to see this movie considering how many few \"normal\" movies he has. Truly, this is one of his most memorable movies. The message, the score, and especially the cinematography capture the essence of everything this movie is about, and Fellini does not make anything in this movie un-enjoyable or trite. Masina has been called the female Chaplin for how she uses facial expressions and body language to show what she is trying to say, and indeed she does this and makes a very very touching performance, and outdoes the rest of the cast (even though Quinn and Basehart are superb) just by doing her role so subtly. No matter what, you can feel the emotions that she presents, and in the meantime gives us one of the most sympathetic performances of all time. The BAFTA nod is well deserved. \"La Strada\" is an excellent movie that is not only dark, but is one of the most touching films I've ever seen. Highly recommended.",

It's so gorgeously shot, and gorgeously written that you can't help but leave the movie with a huge pallet of emotions. The characters are brilliantly crafted, and equally brilliantly acted, that they stick with you long after the film has ended. Not the masterpiece of cinema which 8 1/2 is, but vastly more heartfelt.",

Do we choose things because we thought it out or because we just react?  Masina is fantastic as Gelsomina and Quinn is superb as the deplorable Zampano who reacts and doesn't think.  Innocence is shown very well as Gelsomina is given multiple chances to leave Zampano and do something else but she feels she must stay with him and that she has a purpose by helping him.  It has to be seen to be fully understood and I think the beauty in it is different people may relate to different characters and pull out different things - this flm leaves much more for the audience.",

The success of the entire film is contingent upon the audience falling in love with Gelsomina's quirky personality... and though I was doubtful at first, she won me over.  Giulietta Masina\u00e2(TM)s facial expressions often reminded me of Harpo Marx, not needing extensive dialogue to portay her emotions as her expressive eyebrows told her story.  Anthony Quinn is marvelous (and monstrous) as Zampano, the heartless strongman who constantly rejects Gelsomina.  Punctuated by a beautiful musical theme by Nino Rota, La Strada will tug at your heart and make you thankful for acceptance in this world.",

One IQ less girl knows what is duty, but that guy ? he killed a man and even covered the accident. he fall away the girl on the road. After a few years, he knows the girls was died by him, he feel compunction. One more thing, \"after many years\", maybe many movies will show up on the screen. however, La Strada shows up \"after many years\" by the man asking the woman. And I like it.",

La Strada is an art of cinematography work, and art-direction.\r\n\r\nI think I just found a reason to live. I have always liked Road-Films like The Grapes of Wrath '39 and so on.\r\n\r\nI have learned most intelligent codes of life from this marvelous film, directed by Federico Fellini, Fellini has crossed the boundaries of crafting cinematic-success, after making this grand 'La Strada', what a performance from Giulietta Masina, she has shown both characters of being funny, while she was needed to be and dramatic, when was needed. \r\n\r\nWhat to speak about Anthony Quinn, I love Zampano (Anthony Quinn). He has shown both honor and redemption, from his unbelievable performance, his ending performance as being drunk and crying at beach; is one of most dramatic scenes in the history of Cinema, probably as powerful as the ending scene of Gone With The Wind '39 directed by Victor Fleming, starring Clarke Gable and Vivien Leigh. \r\n\r\nI adore this movie a lot and I salute Academy Awards by honoring it with first Best Foreign Language Oscar Award.",
