Tormented by the belief that God does not exist, Block sets off on a journey, meeting up with traveling players Jof (Nils Poppe) and his wife, Mia (Bibi Andersson), and becoming determined to evade Death long enough to commit one redemptive act while he still lives.",

            "content": "This is certainly a quirky and surreal watch - a surprisingly watchable one. The plot doesn't exactly entirely make sense but it also doesn't entirely matter. I'd say there's an element of farce about it and it even features some (brief) toilet humour/references, which is surprisingly for a film of its age (it was released in the late 1950s).\n\nIts different to the usual black and white films I see or have seen but I thought it was surprisingly amusing and surreal, so its certainly an entertaining watch, even though it covers quite serious thematic material, mainly mortality. As the film went on, I felt more engrossed in the story and the characters, which has to be a good sign, hence my rating. The slow drum beats often present in the background help to add to the tension as well.\n\nI'd recommend this particularly to fans of quirky, classic (perhaps arthouse type) films I suppose - after all, who doesn't want to see a film with scenes featuring death playing chess? (I wonder if the Bill & Ted Bogus Journey film with a similar scene was taking the pee out of that? I bet you didn't expect to read 'Bill & Ted' in a review of a film such as this but, well, there you go!).",

This movie is an interesting showcase of a time period that's bleak and doesn't have much optimism about it. I think the way it presents this bleakness with its visual style is what I liked most about the film. That being said, I feel like there is not much of a concrete story here and the characters didn't always engage me. I respect the film in terms of its style and presentation but for me, the experience of watching it is just an okay one and one I probably wouldn't revisit again.",

To further complicated matters, he is met by a cloaked figure claiming to be Death and, in an effort to save his life, negotiates a game of chess to delay his demise.  Filled with memorably striking images, excellent medieval sets and a typically strong performance from von Sydow, the film effectively deals with the existential theme of being and the debate concerning the existence of god.  However, far too often, just when a dark theme is being prodded and explored, theatrical comedy is introduced (mostly via Plog the blacksmith and Jof the actor) which serves no purpose other than to destroy the atmosphere and turn what should have been a great movie into a good movie, albeit a memorable one.",

            "content": "The Seventh Seal (1957), wonderfully written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, is a Swedish film about a lot of things pertaining to BIG questions such as What is God? What is Death? What is the meaning of Life? and other philosophical and theological shizz that comes with it. It is told via a Chess Match between a Knight returning back from the Crusades and Death itself, with the Black Death/Bubonic Plague ravaging the country acting as the backdrop.\n\nAs is the case with allegorical films such as this, one can take away a lot from their perception of reality and their level of consciousness. The film has subtleties as well as in-your-face messages, especially regarding religion. Since the protagonist is on a journey towards his home, we get to see a plethora of people and how they are living under the circumstances they are dealt with along the way and the different types of humans that can exist. \n\nPlenty of characters to keep you interested and thinking, especially since the performances by virtually all of the Actors are top-notch. My top favourites being Max Von Sydow as the Knight, \nBengt Ekerot perfection as DEATH, Nils Poppe as the lively artist, and probably my favourite character, Gunnar Bjornstrand as the cynical voice of reason. \n\nThere's a lot of powerful imagery in the film often accompanied by a good score. There are MANY great moments that can hit a person differently. For me, one of the most powerful was when Death says \"I Know Nothing\" and the camera zooms in with Death's eyes correspondingly bulging. \n\nMy takeaway is that people spend too much time trying to understand what God is or who God is or how God works yet they forget to actually LIVE, and living in fear of God is not living. Also, fixating on Death is not the way to go either. Acknowledge those things, yes, but carry on with your own journey while keeping love in your mind, heart and soul. If there is one constant we all can agree on, it's Death... and maybe, just maybe, God is Death. The NOTHINGNESS before everything. The Eternal Darkness. The Dark Divine. \n\nWho knows, I could be way off base here as I have only begun learning. Maybe if I watch this film after several years, my understanding of it would be completely different. Regardless, I would highly recommend this classic film if you are in the mood to ruminate on the big things in life. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it an 8.5/10.",

            "content": "Disillusioned knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) and his cynical squire J\u00f6ns (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) return from the Crusades to find the country ravaged by the plague. The knight encounters Death (Bengt Ekerot), whom he challenges to a chess match, believing he can survive as long as the game continues. The game they start continues throughout the story. The knight and his squire pass a caravan of actors: Jof (Nils Poppe) and his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), with their infant son Mikael and actor-manager Jonas Skat. Waking early, Jof has a vision of Mary leading the infant Jesus, which he relates to a smilingly-disbelieving Mia. Block and J\u00f6ns visit a church where a fresco of the Danse Macabre is being painted, and the squire chides the artist for colluding in the ideological fervor that led to the crusade. In the confessional, Block tells the priest he wants to perform \"one meaningful deed\" after what he now sees as a pointless life. Upon revealing to him the chess tactic that will save his life, the knight discovers that it is actually Death with whom he has been speaking. Leaving the church, Block speaks to a young woman condemned to be burned at the stake for consorting with the devil. He believes she will tell him about life beyond death, only to find that she is insane. In a deserted village, J\u00f6ns saves a mute servant girl from being raped by Raval, a theologian who ten years earlier persuaded the knight to join the Crusades and is now a thief. J\u00f6ns vows to destroy his face if they meet again. The servant girl accompanies J\u00f6ns into town, where the actors are performing. There, Skat is enticed away for a tryst by Lisa, wife of the blacksmith Plog. The stage show is interrupted by a procession of flagellants led by a preacher who harangues the townspeople. At the town's inn, Raval manipulates Plog and other customers into intimidating Jof. The bullying is broken up by J\u00f6ns, who slashes Raval's face. The knight and squire are joined by Jof's family and a repentant Plog. Block enjoys a picnic of milk and strawberries that Mia has gathered and declares, \"I'll carry this memory between my hands as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk... And it will be an adequate sign \u2014 it will be enough for me.\"...\n\nUpon its original Swedish release, The Seventh Seal was met with a somewhat divided critical response; its cinematography was widely praised, while \"Bergman the scriptwriter [was] lambasted.\" The film won the Nastro d'Argento for Best Non-Italian Film in 1961. Swedish journalist and critic Nils Beyer, writing for Morgon-tidningen, compared it to Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc and Day of Wrath. While finding Dreyer's films to be superior, he still noted that \"it isn't just any director that you feel like comparing to the old Danish master.\" He also praised the usage of the cast, in particular Max von Sydow, whose character he described as \"a pale, serious Don Quixote character with a face as if sculpted in wood\", and \"Bibi Andersson, who appears as if painted in faded watercolours but still can emit small delicious glimpses of female warmth.\" Hanserik Hjert\u00e9n for Arbetaren started his review by praising the cinematography, but soon went on to describe the film as \"a horror film for children\" and said that beyond the superficial, it is mostly reminiscent of Bergman's \"sophomoric films from the 40s.\" Bergman's international reputation, on the other hand, was largely cemented by The Seventh Seal. The film ranked 2nd on Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1958. Bosley Crowther had only positive things to say in his 1958 review for The New York Times, and praised how the themes were elevated by the cinematography and performances: \"the profundities of the ideas are lightened and made flexible by glowing pictorial presentation of action that is interesting and strong. Mr. Bergman uses his camera and actors for sharp, realistic effects.\" The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 30th Academy Awards, but was not nominated. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads: \"Narratively bold and visually striking, The Seventh Seal brought Ingmar Bergman to the world stage \u2013 and remains every bit as compelling today\".\n\nFinally I have seen Ingmar Bergman\u00b4s \"The Seventh Seal\". A story of existential wonderings of the existence of God, life, death and faith during the middleages. It\u00b4s a dark and visually striking story with Death (Chillingly played by Bengt Ekerot) constantly on the prowl after the knight Antonius Block (superbly played by Max von Sydow), but there\u00b4s also light in the shape of Jof and his wife Mia (wonderfully Bibi Andersson) and their child. It\u00b4s a very stylistic film with a slightly overdriven dramatic direction/cinematography and sometimes the editing and scenestructure wobbles to my mind, but I still think it\u00b4s a quite strong film and I do love the idea of Block playing chess with Death based on the mural \"Death plays chess\" by Albertus Pictor in T\u00e4by church from the 1480s. Ingmar Bergman credited the film with helping him overcome his crippling fear of death. Because the film dealt so overtly with the subject, he found it a highly cathartic experience. \"The Seventh Seal\" is considered a classic of world cinema, as well as one of the greatest movies of all time. It established Bergman as a world-renowned director, containing scenes which have become iconic through homages, critical analysis, and parodies. The title refers to a passage about the end of the world from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\" (Revelation 8:1). \"The Seventh Seal\" is a film you should see.",

            "content": "I really want to like Ingmar Bergman or at least feel something other than boredom when watching his films but after seeing The Seventh Seal I may put watching his films to rest until I enter my twenties and am capable of understanding a true artiste. I have found substance in the films of other European art-house directors like Andrei Tarkovsky and Werner Herzog but this film just seemed pretentious and dreary while wasting a potentially interesting plot and some great actors. I can appreciate that the visual style of this film is stunning and has influenced several future films but that wasn't enough to rescue 96 minutes of self-important dithering.\n\nAntonius Block, Max von Sydow, and Jons, Gunnar Bjornstrand, are knights who have been fighting in the Crusades but who have returned to Sweden as Block encounters Death, Bengt Ekerot, and plays chess with him for his life. Life and death are discussed and interacted with throughout as Block comes to appreciate life as he fails to win the chess games against Death.\n\nI wouldn't recommend spending time with this movie because it is doesn't manage to hold your interest AT ALL. I wanted to care about Block's \u00e2~disillusionment' with life but I felt a distance from him as we keep getting portrait shots of von Sydow's face, yes he was a handsome man at this point, as he smiles or frowns but never in response to anything. The interactions between Block and his estranged wife Karin, Inga Landgre, held some interest to me but I wanted to see their relationship get more fleshed out so I could understand why their reconciliation was important. I felt like we met so many characters and spent so little time with each of them while it felt like I had spent hours and hours with the traveling mute girl. Oh, thank goodness for mainstream cinema where plots make sense and characters act logically in some ways.\n\nI don't ask that a film be completely straightforward or handhold me through all of it's plot developments, I like Krzysztof Kieslowski films, but I need something, anything to work off of. I suppose the religious themes alienated me because I am an atheist who fortunately has not been indoctrinated into believing religious nonsense. This film's discussion of faith and the nature of God was the sort of thing you would find in a Terrence Malick film but this film wasn't as beautiful or moving as any of his films. I needed something surrounding that to be incredible in order for the film to overcome how seemingly ponderous it was. If I wanted to watch a film that interacts with religion unnecessarily I would just watch Ben-Hur (1959).\n\nThe iconic images from this film are deserving of the acclaim they get as it is haunting watching first a terrifying depiction of death and then a bright, ebullient young girl does send the message I believe Bergman is attempting to send. Harsh black and white creates incredible pictures that stay with you long after seeing the film and if this imagery had supported a stronger film I could have really loved it. Bergman steadfastly refuses to let his film be in any way accessible but forces you to keep watching because his ability as a filmmaker is so clear. I was infuriated, angered by how little of this film I understood even as those around me told me it was \u00e2~brilliant' and \u00e2~important'. If a filmmaker refuses to let you in to any piece of their art or what it is trying to communicate then it is worth watching?\n\nHaving read up on Bergman's filmography I now understand that Scenes from a Marriage (1973) is one of his more accessible films or mini series, depending how you categorize it, so I will try to watch it again. I want to see Bergman's visuals and eye for detail applied to a story without alienating allusions or pretentious jibber jabber. Maybe one day I will be able to say that I am a genuine fan of Swedish arty cinema but for now I'll stick to Kieslowski, John Ford, Woody Allen and Noah Baumabch when I'm looking for a film that I'll like.",

One could argue that the misogyny is intended to show the savagery of men, their sinful nature, and that Bergman was calling out this cruel reality.",

People playing at God back then just proclaimed everyone they hated or feared as devil worshipers and most of the \"Christianity\" is paganism with a Christ-theme. Block is a very interesting character who struggles with something that many of us do, the idea that we have to have faith because the alternative is worthless to believe in, yet it's incredibly frustrating that we can't see God and still have to rely on faith without ever seeing Him. Block is smart enough that he could have beaten Death even after admitting his original strategy, but sacrifices his chances in order to save Jof's family. Death comes at us no matter our aspirations and potential, and the film definitely shows a very interesting theme of death surrounding everything. Block never does, while alive, get the answers he seeks to the existence of God because even Death can not answer the question for him because even he does not know. However, Jof did see the Virgin Mary and Christ, so it's very interesting that not only is faith required of us, but some people even get the gift of knowledge that we never will, and yet we still need to believe because that is our test. The cinematography is gorgeous, the acting is great, and it has very interesting themes. I should watch this again.",

            "content": "A morbid contemplation on death and faith.\n\nThe Seventh Seal (1957) is perhaps director Ingmar Bergman's most influential work. It is a slow burn, but pays off in its thoughtful meditations on the reality of God and the value of life. The pacing matches the feudal Swedish setting of the countryside scourged by The Black Plague. As dismal and hopeless as things seem, there is more to Bergman's nightmarish Sweden than appears on the surface.\n\nIt may seem depressing and nihilistic, but it exudes with a charming contentment for the joys of living. Bergman's script is actually very funny with his existential ruminations offset with hilarious black humor. The more serious scenes with the conversations with Death are fascinating portraits of man's wish for a confirmation of God's existence. \n\nI think that The Seventh Seal offers a simple truth: that man can only be happy alongside their friends, family, and acquaintances. Rather than seeking paradise in Heaven, we should find solace and enjoyment in the revelries in life.\n\nIn regards to Bergman's direction, The Seventh Seal is a masterclass in lighting dreary black and white rooms. Bergman illuminates the faces with a tender affection for their painful moments and pensive solitude. His eyes for wide shots of the Swedish countryside are as stunning and memorable as the dance with Death or the chess game on the beach with Death. I think Bergman particularly shined his directorial prowess in the confessional with the knight confessing his disbelief to Death. That entire sequence in the church pits the knight begging and feeling behind bars while the passive Death listens on to trick the knight in a genius stroke of cinematic intrigue and careful technique.\n\nSpeaking of the knight, Max von Sydow delivers a moving and subtle performance as Antonius Block. His empathetic face for the women being burned alive or the unhappy wife of the joker proves Sydow's mastery of expressive facial acting. Sydow acts with a confidence and thoughtful care well beyond his years in The Seventh Seal. I was impressed with every scene that focuses on him. I especially loved the chess sequences and his calm playful attitude next to Death.\n\nThen Death himself, Bengt Ekerot, kills it as the grim reaper. His Death is pale white, but displays a colorful character of delightful measure. His watchful observations of the living as well as his grim forbearance all speak volumes while his character just stands there. His clever wordplay and mirthless banter with Sydow make the chess scenes all the more bitter and entertaining. I loved Ekerot all the more by the end of The Seventh Seal.\n\nI simply must mention the stunning Swedish actress Bibi Andersson as Mia. Her affectionate performance as the wife of the fool is very captivating. Her conversation with Sydow and the wild strawberries was particularly mesmerizing. You could feel how much sadness and hopefulness her character Mia contains.\n\nI should also like to give commendations to Nils Poppe as Jof. His foolish actor is a miserable jester of meager talent and you pity his simplistic wishes all the more for it. Poppe makes you feel for the fool, while laughing at his dismay and visions. I thought he played the part to perfection.\n\nSimilarly, Gunnar Bjornstrand is excellent as the nihilistic squire Jons. His allegiance to Sydow's knight is interesting, but his dire interjections into the film are both funny and sorrowful. His critique of The Crusades is as astonishing as his performance protecting those around him. Bjornstrand is a fascinating actor to watch.\n\nLastly, Erik Nordgren's score to The Seventh Seal is magnificent Gothic classical music that is frightening when it chimes in a few times. The silence sounds so scary and deadly on its own merits for the majority of The Seventh Seal, but the occasional blaring sounds of an orchestra do a great deal for unnerving the audience. The Seventh Seal sounds wonderful.\n\nI just really left The Seventh Seal respecting Ingmar Bergman's craftsmanship as a director. He certainly earned the title of auteur with his uniquely depressing and beautiful direction. I think you should enter The Seventh Seal ready to think and feel about life and death. It is an experience altogether unlike any other movie viewing I have undergone. I am still thinking about it now.",

Those conversations were strong and definitely had me invested in the story. \n\nIn fact anything between the knight and death I found to be the highlight of the film. I thought it made sense, after the difficulty of the crusades and the return to plague-ridden lands, that Antonius would be disillusioned. Also the use of the chess game worked well for me, I just wish I could have seen the board more to see how the game was going. \n\nThere's a lot of interesting characters in the film, and a few of them added some comic relief I never expected. I particularly liked the wry humor of the squire Jons. The difficulty I had with this film was that it seemed a lot of things just seemed to happen at random. I didn't understand how everything flowed together, or how it all played into the primary plot-line.\n\nThe Seventh Seal is one of those movies that I feel relies heavily on symbolism, and that's not my favorite thing. I favor a more traditional narrative. There were moments when this film was working for me, but then it seemed there was a strange detour and it lost me again. I think it probably rewards multiple viewings and deeper analysis, but that's not my kind of thing. But I'm glad I can finally say I've seen it.",

The film creates an environment that is filled to the brim with cynicism with a hint of metaphors. The idea of life against death serves as only a subplot for a film that primarily focuses on how much stress the human psyche can handle.\nWhen all is unveiled, the film leaves you wanting more from its surprisingly short running time. \nRegardless, the film is dark, innovative, and smart. It is one of the most cynical films I have ever seen. \nFor filmmakers, this film is a must-see.",

            "content": "The Seventh Seal is one of those films that is what it is literally and figuratively. Light and dark are themes present in the film's characters, images, and purpose. Death is clearly a representation of the dark, but so is Jons, Tyan, and Antonius to an extent despite him being the protagonist. On the lighter side, there's Jof, Mia, their son, and Karin, who is the wife of Antonius. But only Jof and his family are spared when death comes in the end; they are the only true members of the light, for now anyways. While Antonius is the protagonist of the film, he is a symbol for something more than the dark or light, which is what many of us watching this film will associate him with. He is a symbol for us, what we want when it is time for us to meet our maker. We do not know the answers to life's questions regarding meaning, purpose, or what to believe in. But we want to live. Antonius has no faith; he is jaded and wants answers. But the answers he wants don't come easy without faith. His deal with death makes no difference in his faith. It only gives him just a little bit more time to hold to those questions before he gives up on them in his final seconds. Bergman makes a controversial statement in this film, and that statement is that people have doubts. He opened a door to a world where people can talk about those doubts and express them among people who don't or think they don't. What I am talking about is the doubts revolving around Christianity. Today, we live in a world where it's not cool to believe in Christianity. Or, to put it in a different way, a world where people choose not to believe in religion because it divides us. But for its time, The Seventh Seal made an impact that no other film did, especially in America. While many of us today watching this film might feels its a bit campy or comical, that is just another way in which the film's themes regarding light an dark are expressed. For the film is not all camp or comical, just when it is necessary in comparison to the scenes where death parades his victims for all of us to see or when Tyan is burned for her differing ideologies.",

Also fantastic are the scenes of him asking for knowledge of God in a confessional, and the danse macabre on the hillside at the end.   This film established Bergman on the international film scene, and while it may not be perfect, it will always be one of my favorites.\n\nA knight (Max von Sydow) and his squire (Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand) have returned from the Crusades to find Sweden ravaged by the plague.  Under the torpor and ignorance of religion, the people flagellate themselves and blame and burn a witch.   Death is all around, even in the form of a mask used by a troupe of circus performers, which include an innocent young married couple (Nils Poppe and Bibi Andersson) and their small child.  \n\nIt's the Dark Ages but the things we find are timeless: cruelty, hypocrisy, lust, and yet also the simplicity of love and the quest for God, however ridiculous His absence may seem.  We see the knight faithful to the end, trying to give his life meaning by saving others, and his squire cynical of it all.    \"I could have purged your worries about eternity,\" the squire says, \"but now it's too late.  But feel, to the very end, the triumph of being alive!\"  Death is a certainty and he makes his presence felt, but where is God?  Death himself has no answers to this, and wisely, neither does Bergman.   Life simply goes on without us, and we must hold fast to sweet memories while they last.  Magnificent.\n\nA couple of passages...\nThis is the exchange at the confessional:\nBlock: I want to confess as best I can...but my heart is void.  The void is a mirror.  I see my face...and feel loathing and horror.  My indifference to men has shut me out.  I live now in a world of ghosts...a prisoner in my dreams.  \nDeath: Yet you do not want to die.\nBlock: Yes, I do.  \nDeath: What are you waiting for?\nBlock: Knowledge.  \nDeath: You want a guarantee.\nBlock: Call it what you will.  Is it so hard to conceive God with one's senses?  Why must He hide in a midst of vague promises...and invisible miracles?  How are we to believe the believers when we don't believe ourselves?  What will become of us who want to believe, but cannot?  And what of those who neither will nor can believe?  Why can I not kill God within me?  Why does He go on living in a painful, humiliating way?  I want to tear Him out of my heart...but He remains a mocking reality...which I cannot get rid of.  Do you hear me?\nDeath: I hear you.\nBlock: I want knowledge.  Not belief.  Not surmise.  But knowledge.  I want God to put out His hand...show His face, speak to me.  But He is silent.  I cry to Him in the dark, but there seems to be no one there.  Perhaps there is no one there.  There life is a senseless terror.  No man can live with Death and know that everything is nothing.  \nDeath: Most people think neither of Death nor nothingness.\nBlock: Until they stand on the edge of life and see the Darkness.\nDeath: Ah, that day.\nBlock: I see.  We must make an idol of our fear...and call it God.\n\nAnd this while eating strawberries with milk, the sweetest scene in the movie, with Block remembering his youth and pledging to remember this moment with his new friends:\n\"We were newly-married.  We played and laughed.  I wrote songs to her eyes.  We hunted, we danced, the house was full of life.  ...  To believe is to suffer.  It is like loving someone in the dark...who never answers.  How unreal that is in your company.  It means nothing to me now.  ... I shall remember this hour of peace...the strawberries, the bowl of milk...your faces in the dusk.  Michael asleep, Joseph with his lute.  I shall remember our words...and shall bear this memory between my hands...as carefully as a bowl of fresh milk.\"",

            "content": "Representative of the daunting nature of it's concept of decease, due to the glamorization of life, yet, inadvertently attracting various individuals who seek meaning in their existence thanks to utter confusion & the facing of deviation, Ingmar Bergman depicts the film's intertwining & revealing events by establishing immensely redolent storytelling, as well as representative characters, both of which he directs with true vision. \n\nThe numerous characters in the story delve the viewers into their beliefs and perspectives, as many of them speak of their emptiness, mainly due to a deviating event. Max Von Sydow performs impeccably as a knight, being representative of the good who endeavors to defeat Death at his own game - chess. The game depicts their overruling personalities & calculation of strategies to rid themselves of death. The knight is seemingly unable to find meaning in his life, and seeks an answer through various means, as he tries to deceive death. His friend, a man afflicted by the beatified likings of man, is depicted to be discreetly fearful of decease, yet, tries to hide it through his apparently valiant & uncaring nature. They're all representative of the utmost desire to secure their places in the glamorized concept of life. A family of actors is also depicted, each of whom has a role in a play regarding escapism from death itself. They're depicted as wholeheartedly innocent people, who're evidently in their lord's favor, in spite of their later events - of course, unlike the two aforementioned knights who're still confused, & seek. The Plague is utilized as a topic that would potentially afflict all & is used Death's weapon to enable others to access his lair of sheer deviation. The title not only refers to the seventh stage of heaven, but also it's antithesis, the latter of which delves many people as a way of detecting answers to their queries about life. \n\nBergman not only successfully utilizes the aforementioned aspects to convey his message of fear, but also depicts the consequentiality of various people's tasks, as their beliefs say to be quite significant to their aftermath. He also plies resonantly evocative music during the film's several intense moments to convey true emotions, along with beautiful cinematography. \n\nThe Seventh Seal establishes more than a message in it's viewing, but also revelation. Bergman presents the film's concepts to convey more. To actually reveal more. He proves himself a worthy filmmaker through his incredible philosophy & resonance, making the film an indubitable masterpiece of fundamentality.",

            "content": "Death: Will you never stop asking questions?\nBlock: No. Never.\nDeath: But you get no answer.\n\nThere's this phase that people go through, where they suddenly become hyperaware of their own mortality, and the inevitability of death. This phase is the catalyst to humanity's longest metanarrative and the ultimate question of \"why are we here?\" and \"what does it all mean?\" The truth of our eventual death however is so universal as to be banal, and so most people move past this phase to focus on living instead. It takes bravery then to keep asking what the point of anything is, and artistry to translate that question into a masterpiece of a film. Humanity's quest for knowledge is played out in The Seventh Seal with its striking cinematography, black humour, and existentialist desolation; it is a humane film about the inhumane inevitability of death. The film's title is from a verse in the Book of Revelations: \"And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.\" This verse is translated within the film through God's silence and the difficulty of believing in a God who refuses to acknowledge his own existence. The film then follows a disillusioned knight Antonios Block and his squire Jons returning after decades of fighting in the Crusades to a plague-stricken Sweden. Upon their arrival, the knight encounters the personification of death clad in a black cloak and challenges him to a game of chess as a way to stall for more time. \n\nWhile many films have deaths in them, not many films are very explicitly about death - certainly never to an extent where death is personified, and even less films do so in such an eloquent and sophisticated way. From the start of the film, the black and white cinematography is used to create contrast between physical and spiritual oppositions; the skies are a pure white colour, while the earth is a sickly black. Contrast is also shown between Antonios Block's miserable life caused by his shaken faith, and Jof and Mia, married performers, representing unadulterated faith and purity. When the two come across each other, the knight on his way to his castle, and the couple on their way to Elsinore (an inter-textual reference to Hamlet which also includes a group of travelling actors), they settle down for a picnic, in a stunningly simple scene which seems out of place between the dwelling misery of the film. The group enjoys strawberries and milk, and for once, death is forgotten about while still being omnisciently present through the skull sitting idly behind them, and the chessboard sitting not so far away. This scene is a clear reminder that life is worth living despite our eventual doom, and Bergman does not shy away from clearly depicting this through many other symbols of death strewn throughout the movie. \n\nThe film's blunt depiction of philosophical and religious concepts is complemented by its awareness of its status as a 'film'. It is aware of the redundancy of life, which is shown in the argument between the jester and the blacksmith, narrated by the Jon right after the blacksmith finds his wife with one of the travelling actors. Aware of the language game, he predicts each line with an expressionless face, giving the illusion that he's heard the same argument multiple times before, making the film postmodern in its awareness of the boundaries which surround human dialogue, and the inevitability of the final outcome of dialogue, which in the metanarrative of the film is death itself. The personification of Death allows for the embodiment of the dialogue between life, or humans, and the unknown of whom death is only a stepping-stone towards. The language game of this dialogue is represented by the literal chess game depicting the nature of this metanarrative dialogue and its limitation and to the extent of which it is predictable through the higher knowledge of tactics and forethought. The chess game can even be considered to be inconsequential as the actual game is the one occurring through the exchange of words between the knight and death, which is perhaps why no real importance is given to the individual moves of the chess game. \n\nA micronarrative in the film is that of the historical representation of the bubonic plague and its interesting relation and insight to Michel Foucault's theory on the birth of madness. Foucault explains how the bubonic plague was the start of the quarantine of the \"sick\", and how it forced the public to react with order by careful surveillance of people, as everyone was susceptible to the illness, which in medieval times was very much associated with Godly punishment, adding to the overall relation between physical and spiritual sickness. The scene in the tavern where they speak of a women giving birth to a calf's head and the suicide of citizens to avoid the plague's damnation is a clear depiction of this unfolding, as the people then force Jof into a parody of a dance, forcing him into enacting his own version of madness. This idea is then reinforced when Plog breaks the fourth wall, claiming the world to be mad, and finally, in the most striking scene of the entire film, the final dance with death, which is only ever seen by Jof, tying his madness, the deaths, and his parody of a dance together. \n\n\"Why paint such daubing?\"\n\"To remind people they will die.\"\n\"That won't make them happy.\"\n\"Why always make them happy? Why not frighten them a bit?\"\n\"They'll just close their eyes then.\"\n\"Believe me, they'll look. A skull is more interesting than a naked wench.\"\n\"And if you frighten them?\"\n\"They'll think and be more frightened.\"\n\nPerhaps the best way to summarize the film is with a quote from the movie itself, which is spectacular in that it blends both the contextual and the formal by explaining the film's purpose through the events in the film itself.",

As lofty as it sounds, the strongest comparison I can find for the film's overall effect is that of a modern-day \"Hamlet:\" There's the lonesome hero full of indecision, a band of traveling actors, soliloquies about mortality, memento mori galore, and a narrative that seeks to tackle the greatest and weightiest issues of existence (the chess game itself, of course, being one of the most blatantly obvious yet wonderfully evocative metaphors in all of cinema). \n\nIt's a film-- like most of Bergman's work-- that has somehow gained a reputation for being bizarre, pretentious, alienating, confusing, or boring, but I found the script delightful; it's really a dark (sometimes very dark) comedy with musical sequences and a big cast of lovably oddball characters. There's so much to love.\n\nIt's simply one of the best films about coming to grips with life, death, and faith in a sometimes violent, unloving world-- and will that ever be a topic not worthy of consideration?",

It's worth noting that there's almost no music, further adding to the atmosphere of the film.

The movie becomes a platform for the struggles of faith and the subsequent responses present in our modern times. This dilemma plays itself out most intimately between the doubting Block and the atheistic Jons, ultimately finding its purest summation in the poignant scene in which Block believes himself to be confessing the source of his disbelief to a priest, only to be duped by the ever crafty Death. Here, Block decries his heartfelt desire for knowledge, not faith--he wants to see. However, if he finds resolution in disbelief, he confesses that life can have no meaning. The exchange between the two competitors is haunting and seems to best summarize the dialectic of the film.\nThe Seventh Seal is, at its core, Bergman's musing about how one can have faith in the light of all the evils of the world--from the Crusades to clerical abuses, faith in God proves immensely difficult in light of these travesties. Bergman offers no final solutions, but perhaps tips his hand towards Jons who appears secure in his disbelief, and the most ethically pure character onscreen. Block, in spite of his struggles, is too a modern man. Riddled by doubt, his chess match with Death is little more than an attempt to prolong his search for reconciling his doubt. \nOther characters represent variegated responses the question of faith. Skat is the pleasure seeking hedonist/Epicurean; Raval is representative of a thoughtless, foolhardy faith; and the family of actors--Jof, Mia, and infant son Mikael--are probably most favorably represented as ones happily unoccupied with such questions, merely seeking fulfillment in the love they have amongst themselves.  \nWhile many regard the movie as stylistically archaic, the medium is but the vehicle for the message; Bergman is wise enough to realize that the screenplay could not reasonably be carried out in an environment of realism. The message, not the medium, is meant to carry the day, and as such, The Seventh Seal is likely the greatest philosophical/theological preponderance recorded on celluloid.",

You can easily imagine what they would be like if made today, and for eight bucks, you can find out. But there is a whole separate class of old films that cannot be compared to modern movies because, simply put, they have no modern equivalent. The Seventh Seal falls quite comfortably into this category. What filmmaker today would be daring enough to manifest Death himself as a human being in a film and have him play chess with another character? No one, of course. There is a scene in The Seventh Seal where the main character, a knight who has come to the end of his life and (in a desperate final gamble) challenged Death to a chess game, visits a church. He confesses the emptiness he feels in himself to a priest, and asks why, if there is a benevolent God in heaven, he does not let us see him. The priest then turns to reveal that he is Death himself. Such images could never be reproduced for modern audiences, as they are both too surreal and too depressing.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Seal is from a time when movies were art first and foremost, with entertainment coming second. This movie is a poetic, dark, and deeply disconcerting musing on mankind's fear of death and our gradual yet horrible realization that God is not real. The film follows a knight and his squire, returning from a crusade to their homeland. Along the way, they encounter a lowly juggler and his wife, a treacherous woman and her drunken husband, plague-ridden religious nuts, a woman sentenced to death for witchcraft, and, of course, Death. This weird and mind-bending odyssey may be a lot to handle for audiences that were already put off by the subtitles, but the film is more than worth it. At times, it feels as though it is a silent film from the days when filmmakers were first experimenting with the myriad of weirdness they could put on the screen. But it's far darker than nearly any other movie ever made, and is absolutely uncompromising in its central thesis: That God is not real, and we are alone.\r\n\r\nEven if one does not hold to the message this movie is conveying, nobody can deny that it makes a very convincing argument. Despite some moments of levity and flat-out slapstick comedy, the film almost immediately plunges into extreme existential dread, becoming so flat-out depressing that one almost thinks that director Ingmar Bergman threw the comedy in just so his viewers wouldn't break down in tears. The weightiest of these scenes comes when the \"witch\" who has been accused of causing the plague is burned at the stake. Before her execution, the knight (Max Von Sydow... I can't believe this guy was also in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close) asks her if she knows the Devil. She replies that she does, and he says he wants to meet him, as he must know about the existence of God. The girl asks Sydow to look into her eyes, as the soldiers and priests saw the Devil when they looked at her. Sydow sees nothing but fear and desperation within her. This theme, that we see only what we want to see in the world, is carried through the entire film, with the juggler having strange visions of angels and otherworldly things throughout. And the man whose wife cheated on him immediately accepts her side of the story and takes her back in order to avoid the more painful truth. Bergman makes these jabs at religion quite subtly without actually coming right out and declaring that all gods are bullshit and that the human race is alone on a wildly spinning blue marble in the swirling mass of the cosmos... but I prefer subtlety, especially when such a weighty subject is being tackled.\r\n\r\nNearly every scene in this spectacular film has some underlying message or unstated motivation, but at times it can be a little overbearing. Fortunately, the character of the knight's squire, Jons, fills the hollow soul of the movie by interjecting his own comic relief and unabashed cynicism. Unlike the other characters in the film, he sees the emptiness and pointlessness of existence... and doesn't care. In a way, he's the character we all wish we could be- The person who accepts things as they are and goes with it. Without this character, it would be quite easy to get lost in the pure heartlessness of the film. And believe me, it is truly heartless. This movie wastes no time with fun and games. It's a great film, it's tackling an important subject, and it knows it. It's unwaveringly morbid and consistently confrontational. But I personally have a lot of fun with any film that challenges the core beliefs of myself (or really anyone). Although I agree with the movie's central premise of the lack of a supreme being, I'm not sure if I'm willing to give in to its crushing nihilism. But at least it's something worthy of talking about. The films of today are far more obsessed with depicting the incessant babble of people than the absence of God. \r\n\r\nFinal Score for The Seventh Seal: 9/10 stars. I would give it a perfect score, as it is a perfect film for what it is trying to accomplish, but sometimes I think it doesn't give humanity or life as much credit as they deserve. It is a hopelessly bleak film, and although I'd sit down and watch it again any day of the week, I would probably do so with reservation and apprehension. Movies like this just don't get made anymore, which might be for the better, because stories such as this one probably wouldn't work in HD 3-D IMAX with surround sound and JJ Abrams lens flares. I recommend this film to any movie buffs who want to see one of the best pieces of cinema from a bygone era in filmmaking history. It truly is one of a kind.",

There were moments that nearly moved me to tears simply because of how powerful they were. Masterful storytelling takes full advantage of the visual medium in presenting its ideas through imagery. As slow as it may be at times when the film takes a relief, it is still enthralling and captivating as the film brings us along on the journey. The acting is well-done, particularly from a young Max von Sydow as well as the party he is accompanied by on his journey walking along the line between life and death, fear and faith, love and hate. Musical cues are appropriately gloomy. The radiant visuals provide a stark contrast to the darker subject matter. Whether it's hopeful or pessimistic, you take it as you will yet Bergman shows both sides to the idea of death in that it is both terrifying and reassuring. From the first frame on, Bergman has made a lasting impression on me as a film enthusiast. As a spiritual person, he has given me much food for thought. While I'm not as dismayed as the knight, it's important not to lose sight of how faith can be broken as well as how it can be mended when given the chance to make the roots stronger. It's a deeply resonant film since we all struggle to find meaning and purpose in life as well as affirm our faith, whether it's in nothing or everything. \"The Seventh Seal\" is by far one of the more transcendent films I've come across. A draining experience, yes, but worth the leap (of faith).",

            "content": "The Seventh Seal (1957) - 9,5\r\n\r\nI haven't seen an Ingmar Bergman movie in a long time, oh how I missed it! I highly appreciate the cinema produced by the swedish director, philosophical themes, poetic and human sensibility, intelligence and captivating characters - on this last point, one of the things I especially like about his cinema is the way how he seemed to give attention to women feelings and thoughts, I feel he knew how to express the feminine psyche like very few others, but I don't know for sure if any woman would agree with me. This is not so much the case in \"The Seventh Seal\", but one can see here the direction that Bergman wants to follow in several aspects. I admire this work since the first time I saw it, it always gives me the funny feeling that I'm watching a theatrical play (maybe because \"The Seventh Seal\" is actually based on a theatrical play written by Bergman himself), it has great poetic and human quality, the whole story is a metaphor for life and focuses on applying an existentialist scrutiny on numerous themes, Death, Faith in God, Destiny and Art itself. It culminates by proposing an optimist view on Art. Bergman is able to essay about complex philosophical subjects through a poetic and human cinematic language, to me this is what demarks him from other directors. I mean that his films are intellectual but not cold nor devoid of feeling, emotion or humour. Bergman Cinema thrives with tenderness. \"The Seventh Seal\" plays with my emotions, it's a bittersweet movie, one of the rare kind that manages to break my heart and break me up (laughing genuinely). The obvious technical limitations in its production can be slightly distracting, that's the only reason why I don't rate it higher, but it doesn't matter, this work transcends the sum of its parts... clich\u00e9 statement but it's true for \"The Seventh Seal\", in my opinion. Beautiful movie from one of the greatest masters of Cin\u00e9ma d'auteur.",

The Seventh Seal, truly a classic, has cinematography unlike any other, with superposition of visual plains, lightning and some symbolic imagery, and of course, some philosophic dialogue and then yet-to-be great actors, like Max von Sydow.\n\nThe film tells the journey of Antonious Block as he literally faces Death in a chess game, only trying not to save his life, but to slow down his end so he can make something truly \"meaningful\" for once in his life. As he goes along with his friend Jons, he meets other people that will share his same fate. The interesting things appear in the journey, as they come across many situations and people, with death, God and many other existential themes are around them. Certainly I felt different watching this film, as I knew what and how it wanted to tell the story, and it even gets scary and creepy at times, but being justifiable at the same time, something movies doesn't do anymore.\n\nThe cinematography is really good; the shots capture more than you see, as there are things in the background that you spot, but there's some stuff in the fourth-ground too that maybe you're missing. It's mere symbolism, but that's the charm about it. The shots where \"Death\" appears are filmed 100% accurately, as the character takes the shot and makes it what it needs to be. The environment of the film is constant and feels great, even if it is about death and the overall end; here it's too charming to not love it.\n\nThis movie is one of the most artistically well-done of all time, and while it has its flaws, the good stuff is so good to be weighted down by anything. If you're a fan of cinema, this is a movie you can't miss; it is a great piece of art and cinematography. It combines the two and results in pure masterpiece-ish...yeah, I said that stupid thing.

In hopes of stalling his death and accomplishing, what he calls, his one good meaningful act, he challenges Death to a game of chess knowing that Death is a skilled strategist. In between the various parts of their game, the Crusader (known as Antonius) and his squire Jons meet with a troop of actors, a blacksmith, and his unfaithful wife, all who are fleeing the spread of the Black Death.\n\nThe film is absolutely laden with heavy religious symbolism and concepts about the presence (or as the movie is trying to convey) the lack thereof of God. The film continuously references a verse from the book of Revelations refering to the \"silence of God\" and our main characters' religious and moral beliefs are ambiguous at best, with Antonius admitting to not knowing God nor believing in the Crusade and his squire Jons being a nihilistic jerk. Death the character is not present as often as one may think in the film, but his presence is everywhere from objects that are representative of death (one key scene has Skat's death mask, a skull, pointed towards our characters, perhaps foreshadowing their eventual fates) to just the tone and manner of all of the characters. The cinematography is beautiful, with goregous shots of Sweden and thematically correct camera focus and prop setting in the most important of scenes. The acting is wonderful, with Max Von Sydow giving a great performance as the lost and distant Antonius. \n\nHowever, this is not an easy film to watch, much more to understand. I admit to having to look up articles to understand what the film was trying to note and I can see how this film may not appeal to certain people, not just because of the language barrier (the entire film is subtitled in English, but audibly is in Swedish) but because of its nature as an arthouse film. While it's not easy to watch, I still believe that everyone should give it a watch at some point or another, if not to understand its message, then to just soak in the love and attention placed in every single frame of this masterpiece.

            "content": "Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, \"The Seventh Seal\" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. \n\nTaking its title from the Book of Revelation, \"The Seventh Seal\" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: \"I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me,\" he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented. \n\nBergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (\u00c5ke Fridell), squire J\u00f6ns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.",

No: other than that fundamental divergence, the same theme - of a quest for meaning - threads across both classics, predominantly more so in this one. The subject of parody can best be applied to this film, since, as can be seen even today, the personification of death, in a chilling contrast of white-and-black (a contrast which runs throughout the film), has been subject to pastiches and what-not. But unlike Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal may fall short of offering the amateur viewer a chance for enjoyment, regardless of the fact that both films are of almost the same duration. The Seventh Seal, with its chess theme running profoundly amidst the \"silence of God\", can rightly be judged as the more deep, the more philosophic, and of course, the most allegorical, not only amongst Bergman's pantheon, but even amongst world cinema itself! And that, at any rate, is a direct blow to those self-proclaimed \"parables\" of today, and yesterday, which are, and were, really nothing more cheap affairs sewed and shown for the sake of \"offending\" the Establishment. Because back in the day of Bergman, with classics as diverse as \"Persona\" and \"Fanny and Alexander\". it wasn't just political allegories that scored in the day - for there were, as there should be, a Seventh Seal in that time all over!",

The reputation of a film like The Seventh Seal most certainly precedes it; consistently voted as one of the greatest films ever made, it was far from what I expected. It is a modern day Memento Mori and the collection of disparate medieval characters offering their own perspectives on life coloured with broad strokes of bawdy humour reminded me a lot of Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales and each obviously represents a different perspective on life and death and how we approach them. Rather than a story driven narrative, the film is more a deeply personal window onto Bergman's own angst and catharsis on the subject and doesn't even really invite the audience to muse on the subject themselves; in this way it is very much an artistic piece rather than pure entertainment. This is echoed in the quite astonishing visuals as the film features what must be amongst the very best cinematography I've ever seen; there are an amazing number of striking images, especially the death of Raval which Bergman himself claimed was sheer coincidence. The lack of \"plot\" per se may disappoint some but as a deeply lyrical work of cinematic art, it demands to be seen by anyone who claims to be a film lover.",

Watching this film will make you feel unknowing most of it's play time, but in the end you will realize that it's dealing with a load of topics, themes and messages. I also loved the nice, slow pace - it's really fitting. I haven't seen too many black and white films, but lately I seem to care more about them. I can't imagine this in colors, it's probably better without. There are pretty images here, but i was hoping for even more, especially some more impressive cinematography.\n\nIt will stick with me for a while. I know for sure since it's been some weeks since I saw it already. I enjoyed the many deep, unforgettable words and the metaphores. Some very humours quotes that burn \"stay in the kitchen\"-jokes are in this one as well, I loved it. The expression and the acting is superb and I've learned that Swedish girls were hot in the 50's as well. It never moved me, but it will stay with me. The atmosphere is sticking with me - I felt the entire film - that's even better. You might enjoy true love, you can find peace in religion, but you can't outplay death. Check (it out) mate!",

I had no qualms with the movie's heavy religious discussion, as one can easily identify with Mr. Bergman's spiritual disillusionment. Structurally, however, I was disappointed. I felt that \"The Seventh Seal\" plodded along without much aim, the uncompromising subject matter weighing it down even further. Some of the acting was rather shoddy, and the film never reached any sort of satisfying resolution (which was obviously the point, but I digress).",

Blocks are built around the pensive Knight Antonius Block, who encounters Death at the film's onset in a chess match; nothing short of a Shakespearian prophetic prologue.  And along the way he has a spiritual journey -- the meaning of life and his place amongst these Crusade conflicts.  \n\nBergman chooses an arbitrary setting in the Crusades, keeping anyone from rushing to a history book and learning what's being spoke of, and rather solely focusing on exploring the situations.  I imagine it's well researched, that the scenarios presented are ones worth talking about, and that perhaps costume and set pieces clue the viewer in to a more specific framework -- that's for a historian to know, not a movie critic.  But Bergman doesn't rely on anything besides a temporal audience, relating the same conflicts of confoundment these characters find themselves in to anyone else roaming the earth through various conflicts and trying to place themsevles at the center of its meaning.  We're given this opportunity to explore by equally painted landscapes and portraits, where the expression of the subjects meets the impression of the backdrop.\n\nAs an admirer of art provoking the times we live in, questioning war and religion, I consider this an important film.  But a 5-star rating is only garnered by all the perfections which make a film readable and enjoyable, beyond the importance.  Overall, the task of the filmmaker is to communicate, and when you look at a picture in 2012 made in 1957 set in the Middle Ages, and you can not only say \"I get that,\" but equally emotionally engage in it, than it's a film made for a wide audience, and it's communication-value is perpetually significant.\n\n5 stars",

And what better man to make that case than the Swedish director extraordinaire Ingmar Bergman, today widely considered one of the greatest aueters in cinema history. Bergman created this Medieval meditation on death as a play for the acting students at Malmo City Theatre under the title \"Wood Carving\" betraying the type of story it would be telling. Over the course of roughly five years it would be performed numerous times as a play and radio show that Bergman directed, before becoming his seventeenth film as The Seventh Seal which he shot in thirty five days with a little over 150,000 dollars. Almost all of the film was shot in a studio with the exception of the opening and closing shot and was made under frenzied working conditions that may contribute to some of the films unevenness. Still the movie along with Rashomon seven years earlier made a strong case for international world cinema to be taken seriously especially in the arthouse realm. How does it hold up today on its merits as a film? Let's take a chess playing look. \r\n\r\nAs our movie opens Knight of the Crusades Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) returns from the horrors of war with his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand). As they reach a scenic beach the two become exhausted and can go no further and Antonius encounters the specter of Death (Bengt Ekerot) who has come to claim them. He forestalls Death by convincing him to play a game of chess with him though he is in the habit of playing chess by himself and that is how the rest of the world sees him. He and Jons continue on their journey back to Block's castle across a Swedish countryside ravaged by the Black Plague, and Block seeks to use his reprieve to commit one last honorably act before death claims him feeling remorseful and disillusioned for his role in the Crusades. Along the way they gain an entourage including a Blacksmith named Plog (Ake Fridell), his wife Lisa (Inga Gill), married acting duo Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson) and a mute girl Jons saves from rape (Gunnel Lindblom). As they ravel through the small town near Block's castle, death is ever present and evil follows.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things about this movie that work so well it's a bona fide modern classic and very few things that sadly don't work very well at all. The direction is suffice to say in the works well category with to this today staggeringly beautiful cinematography that makes the very best use of contrasting black and white in a black and white film, the opening scenes in particularly featuring stunning back drops and the rest featuring incredible sets. The plot however is where we run into more trouble, there's nothing wrong with the story itself necesarrily but it's actually a rather effective meditation on faith and the collapse of it, as well as on mankind's fear and various reactions to death. But it's rather weak when it comes to effectively creating a Medieval world, not terribly weak but not especially strong either. The costumes seem right but there aren't very many details that make it feel like a medieval village and not just a studio set which is especially odd given the opening and closing scenes, in fact not much thought is given to period details and trappings at all which would be a much bigger deal were it a story about life after the Crusades and not a highly metaphorical one. It's also due to the highly metaphorical nature of the story we can forgive its uneven pacing and inability to balance out its comedy and never ending depths of despair. Still especially bearing in mind its considerable place in movie history, none of these things feel that important even some hokie performances from supporting actors when you have such appealing emotional moments as when Block watches a woman be burned alive for consorting with the devil and the charged ending, which hauntingly display doubts about death we all have in a bare raw way previously unseen in the world of film. The main actors also all do the material which is clearly derived from a play (not a bad thing) credit particularly the incomparable Max von Sydow who brings a humanity and gravitas as well as at times life affirming joy to his world weary knight.\r\n\r\nSeventh Seal is a classic, a world classic that changed the movie world when it came to foreign releases and put movie master Ingmar Bergman on the map. It's easy to see why this movie would have intrigued given Hollywood at the time and the unique creation of the work coupled with the stunning visuals and the now mild pop culture icon interpretation of Death as a black gloved monk as ominously and oddly comically portrayed by Bengt Ekerot. The movie is an existential wreck that asks the big questions before giving us the answer of religion and stunning view of the road to the afterlife straight out of a wood carving, but also is at times wonderfully comic which make it eminently watchable again and a again to the discerning open minded viewer. The Seventh Seal is a classic, one of my favorites and a movie that demands to be seen over and over again.",

            "content": "The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's meditation on Christianity and death, told through the tableau of a medieval setting and a mixed bunch of players on the stage. Max von Sydow headlines the cast as the Crusader knight who famously challenges Death to a game of chess, and the film follows his ruminations as well as the lives of others caught up in the same time and place.This is certainly an original film, I can't think of one quite like it, but It may not rank with Bergman's best work however one that's tough to describe. It has an almost episodic feel in places, and there's no real thrust to the narrative; instead it's more of a depiction of everyday life, exploring interactions between various folk. But despite the lack of obvious focus, it's never less than utterly watchable. Melodrama it might be, but it's good melodrama.Bergman has a way of directing that reminds me of Kurosawa; he doesn't do anything obvious but his film nevertheless looks stylish and carefully composed throughout. The Swedish cast members are all very good and there are lots of powerful moments, from a jester being bulled in a wayside inn to the ultimate fate of a hapless witch. The ending employs a classic bit of imagery that left me feeling chilled.",

If there's a film that represents that person, it's THE SEVENTH SEAL.  The picture-often considered one of the all-time great films, as is filmmaker Bergman-opens with a title card and begins with about fifteen minutes devoted to an interesting story.  In Sweden, during the time of the Black Plague, a young man (Max von Sydow) plays games of chess with the figure \"Death\" (Bengt Ekerot) as he furthers into his questions about life, death, and God.  With that philosophical premise, one would hope for a moving, thought-provoking story.  Sadly, the story barely moves on; instead, it meanders while featuring silly, monotonously spoken characters, unintentional humor, and quizzical plot points.\n\nread it all at themoviefreakblog.com",

            "content": "Man's own fear of death and his struggle with the existence of God. Subjects for your consideration in Ingmar Bergman's art house cinematic milestone, The Seventh Seal. Did i think it was any good though? Well, not at first. I almost feel guilty admitting it, but in some cases, and in order to form a well rounded opinion, a film needs time to be digested and this symbolism heavy experience is a perfect case in point. A knight (Max Von Sydow) returning from the crusades is visited by Death (Bengt Ekerot). As a last request, the knight challenges Death to play him at a game of chess, the deal being if the knight wins he gets to keep his life. Death accepts and the film begins. In many ways it's a fascinating study on the evolution of film. There's the iconic visual imagery that's been referenced by artists such as Woody Allen, and in popular culture like Bill And Teds Bogus Journey. It's an unsettling film that aims to get under your skin by questioning the fragility of life and mysteries beyond it. The knight desperately questions the existence of God, \"How can we believe in the faithful when we lack faith? What will happen to us who want to believe, but can not?\" ,while Jof, a local villager and family man is accepting in a child-like way of his visions of angels. At no point did i feel as though the film was stating any rights or wrongs, simply asking questions to which we have no logical answer and how within that, there exists a sense of creeping loss. For any serious film buff, it's essential viewing. It might not be to everyone's taste, it's grim with an uneasy sense of foreboding and doom hanging over it,  but there's no denying it's striking, symbolic imagery and it's importance in the history of cinema. 5/5",

Man, I just got some crazy image of a camera panning down a row of seals and the seventh one at the end is blood red, with horns, an arrowhead tail and black eyes... as well as goat legs. Hey, if true evil is supposed to be the most horrifying image of the defilement of innocence, then I think a demon seal with goat legs would pretty much be about as horrifying as it can get, next to some middle-aged, white-faced guy in a black cloak, of course. In case you couldn't have picked up on that, seeing as this is typed, that was sarcasm. I mean, I'm sure that's the most horrifying image for Max von Sydow now, seeing as he's old enough to know the Grim Reaper when he sees him, but this movie was 55 years ago, back when he was 96 and still relatively young. He's so old he was actually in the Crusades, but hey, that authenticity makes the film all the cooler, yet not quite cool enough to completely lift the film from its problems.\r\n\r\nThe film offers little, as far as exposition is concerned, and offers plenty, as far as excess material is concerned. For those thinking that this seemingly simple concept must go deeper and broader to reach its almost 100 minute runtime, well, you're wrong, because there's not enough to material for the film to warrant being even that long, and 100 minutes is not that long by film standards. Sure, the film could have bought some time if it had made up for the lost exposition, but instead, it chooses to make ends meet with overlong, sometimes rambling sequences the often lose steam so startlingly fast that resonance is all but killed dead. What brings the film closer to that death by steam loss is, of course, unrelentingly dry, quiet slowness that plagues (Black Death pun not intended) this film to no end and leaves you so very underwhelmed as the film limps along to its point. However, although the film's resonance takes many a vicious blow, it never slips into tedium nor even mediocrity. Well, of course it wasn't going to slip into mediocrity back in 1957, where we would take whatever we could get, yet no matter what time you're in, the film impresses to one degree or another. It's not enough to make the film generally impressive, as a whole, but it is enough to keep it going.\r\n\r\nThe film's cinematography is nothing terribly special, let alone good enough for the film to be considered a masterpiece of cinematography, but there is something gritty and gripping enough about the lighting and angles to hold your attention through most of the film. That gritty lighting is at its most effective when we get to the darker stuff, at which point the cinematography subtley presents a sense of bleak isolation to supplement atmosphere. Mostly, the atmosphere is as dry as dirt, but there is the occasional decent moments of tension, or even intensity, something I feel is reflected pretty sharply by Erik Nordgren's score. Even back then, apparently before the could figure out sound mixing, booming, darkly operatic coirs were still awesome, and while there's only so many moments of musical awesomeness, just like there's only so many moments of tonal awesomeness, whenever that stuff does come into play - typically at the right moment -, you wake up. Still, those moments are so occasional, and when they do come, they don't so much knock you out as much they simply keep you awake. What does, in fact, keep you going and keeps this film from falling apart is, well, charm, something I was not expecting to find in a film like this, yet lo and behold, this cast is a colorful one, with no real impressive performances, but plenty of charming ones. I wish the film rode on more than just that, but it does keep the film afloat, nevertheless and ultimately saves it greatly.\r\n\r\nOverall, the resonance of the film loses steam in the midst of padding and very limited, while finding itself all but terminated by consistent slowness and dryness, but with a handsomely gritty visual and, occasionally, musical style to compliment a deal of moments of effective tension and compelling intrigue, as well as across-the-board charm throughout the cast, \"The Seventh Seal\" is left a generally watchable symbolic study on facing death during humanity's most endangered point, underwhelming though, it may be.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

            "content": "\"We must make an idol of our fear, and call it god.\" - Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) in The Seventh Seal\r\n\r\n\tForeign films are sometimes a very difficult art to absorb. The language barrier and subtitle effectiveness are a staggering obstacle to come over and still appreciate the film as a whole but it takes a true artist to transcend mere oral languages and truly grasp the reality of the language of cinema. Perhaps no other film is better example of how gracefully a story can be told and interpreted in multiple ways then Ingmar Bergman's 1957 world class masterpiece, The Seventh Seal.\r\n\r\n\tThe impressive original screenplay from the Swedish auteur evolved from a play he had originally wrote for acting students, then to a radio episode, and then became the legendary film the cinematic world cherishes today. It is the tale of a knight named Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) whom along with his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand), has just returned from a crusade during the 14th century only to come home to the Black Plague. One day washed up on a beach Antonius meets Death (Bengt Ekerot). Hoping to claim the knight's life, Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess to duel for his fate.\r\n\r\n\tThe beauty of The Seventh Seal is that despite its simple story that could be comprehended by a small child via storybook format, the movie is loaded with symbolism, provocative lines and spiritual meaning. So much can be taken out of practically every line in The Seventh Seal that goes well beyond the realm of mere character dialogue to advance the plot. No movie questions the existence of God, the purpose of humans and the communication between mortals and higher powers as articulately or artfully as The Seventh Seal. There are so many characters that represent heavily biblical traits and The Seventh Seal is able to juggle a million theologically lofty ideas at once without dropping the ball once.\r\n\r\n\tThe ideals of The Seventh Seal are all just as poignant as the nest but my personal favorite and the most timeless of all them in a very timeless film is the metaphor that is the protagonist, Antonius Block. Antonius represents the human doubt of God's existence, or at least the universal struggle to maintain ones faith in the lord. \"Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.\" This quote effectively summarizes Block's character and perfectly illustrates the often turbulent relationship between God and mankind.\r\n\r\n\tBesides the deeper meanings, cynicism, symbolism and unique narrative conveyed by the screenplay, The Seventh Seal is a masterpiece is every other aspect a film appreciator could hope for. The black and white cinematography is absolutely sharp and stunning; there is no doubt that there are a handful of exquisitely beautiful images now permanently etched in my mind from The Seventh Seal. The acting in the film is also top notch as well as the renowned direction style of Ingmar Bergman.\r\n\r\n\tThe Seventh Seal is the greatest film Sweden has ever produced and easily fits in among the list entries of the greatest films ever made. A gorgeously crafted piece of art, a timeless provoker of deep thought and a perfect gateway drug to the magnificent Ingmar Bergman, The Seventh Seal is a film that helps to define the movies and how the magic of film can transcend any language.\r\n\r\nGrade: A\r\nReviewed by Ben Pieper on March 24th 2012",

The characters don't really feel like characters, they just seem like sources that Bergman uses to shoot out philosophical ideas. The film comes off as pedantic at times.

The film begins with Max Von Sydow resting on a rocky beach. He looks up and sees death, watching him. In efforts to delay his inevitable fate, he challenges death to a game of chess for his life. This game is paused and revisited throughout the film, as Death follows the knight and his entourage across the country. It is difficult to convey what the film is like, it is simply a fantastic work, with outstanding photography, equally good acting, and Bergman's signature gloomy, spiritual atmosphere. The film is far from depressing, as with most of his films, despite the dark ideas behind nearly all of them. The Seventh Seal is a wonderful film which propelled the legendary director into a position where he could make even more fascinating and remarkably good films.",

But when the black-robed figure of Death confronts him, the knight challenges him to a game of chess.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Seal is probably one of Bergman's most accessible film.  Once you explain the synopsis to a friend it's likely his/her interest would be peaked, it's just a wonderfully simply yet curiously contagious concept of a picture.  In execution, the picture is quite a bit more complicated.  The film itself devotes very little time to the famous chess match between knight and death, much more attention is focused on the plague rattled landscape and the inhabitants that populate it as the Knight travels from shore to his home.  Much like Bergman's later films' such as \"Through a Glass Darkly\", the film asks existential questions about love, death and god.\r\n\r\nThough the film is unquestionably an art film intended to provoke it's  audience into thought rather than to entertain.  The Seventh Seal holds up well against contemporary cinema, with crisp, vivid cinematography, memorably minimalistic art direction and of course Bergman's stylish direction that adds enough humor to keep this dark tale from be\r\ning too depressing.  Also, the cast is perfectly picked, Max Von Sydow in particular, is perfectly cast to convey a gloomy, war trodden Knight tired of the hell of combat.  All of these aspects make this a film that should be able to entertain even a casual movie-goer, which isn't always the case with old art films.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Seal is one of the most memorable film's of the 50's, a well studied masterpiece, and an absolute essential of Ingmar Bergman's library.",

Throughout the film, characters blame occurrences such as the black plague on God, helplessly resorting to the idea that they have no individual control over their destinies. Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who \"hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles.\" The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choices-as is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival.",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman teams up again with frequent performers Max Von Sydow and Bibi Andersson for another pleasurable oddity. One thing I love about Bergman's work is the extraordinary black and white images he captures. He is also brilliant in his efforts to intrigue with taboo topics in his pictures. From what I have seen and what I've read, no two pictures are alike which makes them stand alone even among the related Bergman volumes. Here, faith and the existence of God are core categories for debate and viewing. The scenery and story are expertly put on display and though interesting enough, like many other Bergman films, it may require a second viewing to soak up all that is intended.\r\n\r\nAfter a long crusade, a knight played by Max Von Sydow is voyaging home. Along the way, he meets Death but is unprepared to hand his life over. He challenges Death to a game of chess in order to buy more time. The dark figure accepts the challenge. During his continued journey, the knight comes across a goofy actor and his family. The actor's wife (Andersson) has a precious baby boy and knight becomes fond of them. Along this journey home and reflecting on his life, the knight ponders if God exists and the meaning of His silence. With Death near and his religious mysteries unsolved, the knight tries to make some sense of it all and perhaps see his wife one last time before succumbing to his fate. \r\n\r\nIt is a heavy story and one that must be seen more than once I believe. Is God here, with us now? Where is He? Questions like these while trying to beat Death at a game he knows all too well are enormous mountains to view with one snapshot. I wanted the film to be darker and maybe even more sinister. I see traits of it and it touches the edges but unfortunately it focuses on the goofy actor (an aggravating Nils Poppe) much of the time as well as other silly additions to the plot. What Sydow does here at the direction and visual assistance of Bergman is borderline masterpiece. The bright spots outweigh the silly nature that invades the dark story but I must admit that they took a toll in the experience as a whole. I cherish the screen time and interactions with Death and Sydow and so far in my limited Bergman viewings, they are among my favorites. Additional viewings will surely define the beautifully and complex depths I've only begun to embrace, and until then I will seek out more of this brilliant directors work with this film on the forefront.
