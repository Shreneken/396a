            "content": "I quite like that both of the Godfather films start with a celebration - a family related one at that. I found myself humming along to some of the instrumental tunes played during the celebration scenes. The dances and optimism start the film on a light note, I feel, although we can't not be suspicious that darker moments are (surely) to come. The colour in this film is very yellow heavy at times - giving it an added nostalgic sense to it. Indeed the subtitles themselves are in a light yellow tone. Speaking of dialogue (pardon the pun), it is again often quite hushed but I managed to follow the majority of it, so it wasn't too much of an issue. I suppose it does add to the sense of tension. I liked that it explained the origins of the families name (surname, to be precise). I liked seeing the classic cars and scenes set in dark lit pubs - its quite atmospheric.\n\nThe performances are very good - facial expressions well put across. I particularly liked Robert DeNiro playing the young Don Vito. I like that the characters are fairly low key (big action scenes aside). It makes the plot more intriguing. I found myself, at times, almost literally wondering what may be around the next corner., so I found it suitable engrossing\n\nOf course I've no direct knowledge of the Mafia/gangsters or anything of the sort but it did seem to me quite authentic, or at least the performances were very believable and I admired the cinematography, with some scenes set in picturesque places such as Cuba, as well as Italy and of course the US. I could almost feel the heat from the scenes set in hot countries.\n\nIf I were asked what one thing stood out the most for me in this film, I'd say the music, including live performances. Its quite absorbing overall, certainly compared to sequels of other big films. I do still prefer the original film to this sequel but their both very good films overall. I particularly liked the subtelty this film has. In any case, of course I would recommend this film, yes.",

At  three hours plus this is commitment to get though as it could easily have been made into two separate movies.  But you always feel like you're watching something special.

            "content": "I do have to agree that calling Godfather Part II a sequel is rather insulting. It is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was that says a lot. The Godfather Part II is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. People may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. Of course, but I think that was deliberate. Both this and the first Godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling.\n\nFor one thing, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. The music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. Then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. The film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where Vito flees Sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.\n\nThe acting is superb once again. Vito is brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro in one of his better performances. I was also taken with Robert Duvall as loyal Tom, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. But the picture belongs to Al Pacino. He was great carrying the first Godfather movie, but he is even better here. He is simply phenomenal, and to be honest I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

They did this sequel emphasizing things like the dark & brooding atmosphere, the intensity of Pacino's character and the allure of learning more about the borderline-mythical Brando character, but they did so at the expense of pace and intriguing plot. Putting two 90-minute movies together the way they did meant double the exposition & double the rising action, but the relatively tepid nature of the prequel story didn't result in double climactic finales to compensate. Even the Michael story had much lower stakes than the first movie had; the drama this time was contained within the family rather than being an external effort to kill them all. The film score wasn't better than it had been in the first movie and the supporting cast were less interesting (save for Strasberg's character). I did like the sheer ambition of merging the two movies together and that Keaton had a larger role here, but overall I'm just thoroughly surprised that this is considered on par with the first movie.",

We see how the \nCorleone family became a part of the organized crime. So you can imagine how would have turned the family if Clemenza wouldn't have giving his guns to DeNiro's Vito Corleone. Never Michael would have ended up like that and none of the brothers would have died. Maybe. And that is what is nice with seeing the backgrounds of Vito, you can see time changing a family of honest citizens and understand how little events can change someone for the rest of his life. For good or for bad.\n\nI also liked the score that is simply marvelous. The story is good. There is simply no plot holes. Everything is cover and it permits you to follow the movie more easily. The end with the flashback and the killing of Fredo was perfect but really destructive because you could see Michael when he was still \"orthodox\" and then you see him order the murder of a brother. He lost everyone he loved by trying to weep his enemies out. \nKay, his 2 brothers, his father and his children, sort of.\n\nA long but brilliant and efficient masterpiece!",

The movie alternates equally between the stories of a young Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) starting his career in crime on the streets of early 20th century New York, arriving at Ellis Island after his parents were murdered by a crime boss in Sicily and 1950s Nevada where Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has taken control of the mob family after the death of Vito. Thanks to a clever and insightful script from director Francis Ford Coppola and novelist Mario Puzo, both storylines are compelling with seemingly more character development than in the first installment.  Additionally, Gordon Willis' cinematography is great, especially the interior shots where Willis uses effective lighting to obscure the presence of henchmen in dark corners and to mask the emotional expressions of the characters in shadows.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II: What is the Price of the Choices We Make?\nThis Week I watched the 1974 film The Godfather Part II directed by Francis Ford Coppola and Starring Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro and John Cazale. Set both before and after the events of the first Godfather, the film tells the story of Don Corleone's rise to power while simultaneously recounting his son Michael's further fall from grace. As a young boy in Sicily, Vito Andolini attends his father's funeral with his mother when he receives news that the same Mafia mob that killed his father has now killed his older brother. When his mother pleads to the Mafia head, Don Ciccio, to spare her last son, he orders her killed. When Vito runs off he orders him killed as well. Vito escapes to America and takes the name of his home town of Corleone. Without money or family, he sets out to provide for himself and make his fortune. Michael Corleone starts the film in much the same way as Vito did in the first Godfather, this time business interrupts the festivities of his son's first Communion. The family has moved to Nevada and Michael, as Don, is trying to keep the family fortune by strategic alliances, purchases and assassinations. As time goes on and in an attempt to keep his father's legacy, Michael loses many people near and dear to him while trying to keep his crime family going. The thing that struck me most about the film overall is that not only does it continue the great style of storytelling from the original, it's narrative structure is one of foreshadowing; with promises made and kept done quite intelligently and in the most effective and sometimes devastating way possible. A great example is in an early scene we see Michael's brother Fredo's phone ring in the middle of the night. The caller is identified as Johnny and the nature of the conversation, though vague, tells the audience that Fredo is in league with another organization. Later it is revealed that this \"Johnny\" is Johnny Ola, the right hand man of a rival mob boss named Hyman Roth. Fredo Tells Michael that he has never met Johnny before when the two of them go to meet him at a New Years Eve party. When Fredo lets it slip in Michael's hearing that he had actually talked with Ola before, Michael knows that Fredo has betrayed him to a rival gang. By a brief prior scene, the film makes us suspicious of Fredo's allegiances so that his lie to Michael can be understood as Michael understands it; as a real betrayal. Michael talks with Fredo afterward and the latter confesses his past correspondence with Roth and his bitterness toward Michael being the Don and not him, Michael disowns Fredo but says to his capo that nothing is to happen to Fredo when their mother is alive. After the entreaty of his sister Connie, Michael reconciles with the penitent Fredo at the funeral of their mother. However as the two embrace, Michael looks to his capo with a grim expression reminding us of their previous exchange, and that this reconciliation is not sincere and Michael is determined that Fredo must pay for his unfaithfulness. Other moments of foreshadowing are more poetically significant than narratively. When Tom, The Corleone Lawyer, goes to visit Frank Pentageli in prison, the nature of the scene between them seems to indicate a rather long winded way of Tom convincing Pentageli That the Corleone family holds no hard feelings for his near treachery. However When Pentageli recounts how conspirators against the Emperor in Rome would bleed themselves to death in the bathtub rather than be prosecuted for conspiracy, we know that by associating their situation with his, Pentageli is not convinced of the Corleones good will and all is still not right. Sure enough, not long after, Pentageli is found dead in his bath, bled to death. These are just a few of many examples of great foreshadowing in the film. The Godfather Part II tells its story just as personally and as powerfully as its predecessor but juxtaposes the rise to power in crime of the first generation with the fall from power of the second generation. Putting us the audience in the life of crime where normal domestic existence is impossible, circumstance traps honorable people in dishonor and Two Men: Vito and Michael, by the choices they make, fight for their survival and doom those around them to suffering.\nThe Godfather Part II, though incredibly personal, creates an atmosphere and world for its characters to exist in. One of ferocious intensity and violence coupled with beauty and affection. Right off the bat at the opening title Nino Rota's haunting score paints the perfect mood with the sound of a single trumpet playing a mournful tune. The production design immerses with its beautiful simplicity and transports the viewer to two different countries and time periods through masterful attention to detail. The cinematography is gorgeous (as films of that time period were apt to be) but never showy. The camera shows only what it needs to show and does so with simplicity and skill. Every aspect of the film points to the drama of the characters, and behind the drama are the actors. The weight put on the performances is exactly what should happen with a human drama such as the Godfather. Character is the most important element and without the acting to show for it, the film drops. All the actors give wonderful and emotional performances with stand outs being Pacino, Cazele, Keaton, Duvall and De Niro. De Niro deserves special recognition because of his ability to not only embody the character of Vito Corleone, but portray the younger and more na\u00efve side of his humanity. He was able to perfectly replicate Brando's raspy voice (albeit clearer and younger sounding) and little nuances like the way Brando would break eye contact or scratch his chin during a conversation. At the same time he brought youth to the character. The look in young man's eyes when he sees his first child, or when he first breaks the law, or when he is outraged by injustice. De Niro stayed true to Brando's portrayal and the character of Vito Corleone while adding even more depth and humanity to the character. Both Vito and Michael live in this world, conveyed not created by Writers Puzo and Coppola. They live in a world where things said and done by someone in anger or passion can cause the death of that person; where a man can be living his normal domestic life when suddenly gunshots fire on him and his family. They live in the hyper reality of the mob; where everything done or said can and must have terrible consequences. Both Michael and Vito learn that to make or keep their fortunes they must combat crime with crime. A moral high ground is impossible in crime when your adversaries disregard morals completely. This fact drives both men from a desire to be honorable into what they believe to be a necessary blindness to the moral ambiguity of their actions. The premise of the Godfather Part II is a tragic one. Treachery answered with treachery, violence answered with violence and a place where compassion is unprofitable.\nThe chief dilemma that the film poses is the inevitability of circumstance. When a film about criminals and immoral people succeeds in humanizing its main characters than the prevailing sentiment towards our less then heroic heroes is one of sympathy rather than condemnation. This pattern in crime and gangster movies is one that has caused concern with those who feel that ethics and morals should be clearly stated. Movies that cause us to identify with bad people can make someone want to imitate those bad people. While this may be true in some scenarios and with some films, The Godfather trilogy portrays what is real, and what is real is not desirous. When a film glorifies it's morally questionable and tragic subject matter then it is in a way telling its audience that what it portrays is normal or at least acceptable. When a film portrays crime as it really is then not only is it open for serious interpretation but it shows the realities of the brutal lifestyle one has to live as a gangster. One reason I felt sorry for these characters and especially Michael and Vito is the nature of the circumstances they were born into. Vito's family was killed and he was forced to flee to America at a young age. He tries to live his life right while in a district ruled by the crime boss Fanucci. When his job is taken away from him because Fanucci makes the owner give the position to his nephew and when he is unwittingly involved in a burglary he looks toward the life of crime as possibility for the first time. Michael never chose the life of crime and in fact started out against it. In the first Godfather he tries to go legitimate by joining the Marines in World War II. It seems like fate is against him when his oldest brother dies and he is chosen to be the successor of his father. Suddenly Michael finds it his duty to ascend the role that is necessary for him to don (no pun intended) and begins the ruthless lifestyle that his father started to keep the family afloat. Each man seems to have been driven into crime against their wills and it is heartbreaking to think of the consequences they face for it later.  It is definitely not wrong to feel sorry for a person who does wrong but the reality is that every step they took into their life of crime was as making it harder to go back. Michael promises his wife that \"In Five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate\" but with each choice to operate as the necessarily merciless head of the family he confirms that the family must remain as it always was. Every time each man chose to repay crime with crime they doomed themselves and their children to live the life of tension, fear, mistrust and power.\nThe goal of the Godfather Part II was to tell the further story of the Corleone Family but also to portray the journey of two men in the crime organizations: Vito's rise and Michael's descent, and to show the humanity in the motivations  and reasons for their choices. I believe Vito's goal, though never spelled out in black in white, was one of success. The state he was left in was almost utterly helpless and his desire was to be someone and to make a name for himself (as he quite literally made the Corleone name for himself) and to ultimately provide for his wife and four children. In these respects Vito succeeds. He becomes one of the most powerful men in New York he even gets revenge on the man who killed his family and tried to kill him too and he earned the name \"Godfather\". He keeps his sanity and soft spoken demeanor for the rest of his life and even though he faces trials with his family he dies with his personal life intact and is able to enjoy his last years after he makes his faithful son Michael Don in his stead However even if Vito escaped a great consequence for his choices, those consequences would come upon his children. Michael's goal is to carry on the family business, no matter what it takes. He exacts his policies and commands for murders without second thought for the sake of the business finally has his brother killed. In his attempt to hold his crime family together however, his real family falls apart and in turn his character. The main examples of this are in his final confrontations with his brother Fredo (which I've already recounted) and with his wife Kay. After returning home from negotiating a deal in Cuba, Michael meets with Tom and Tom tells him that his wife has had a miscarriage. When Michael finally talks to Kay about it, she reveals that it wasn't a miscarriage, but an abortion. She had aborted the baby so that it did not have to be born into such a terrible life as Michael was. Not only is it a severe blow to Michael to know that he could have had a child but also a great insult. Kay finally speaks her mind on her disgust with the life that they lead and says that he will never be legitimate. In his anger Michael strikes her and the two separate from that day forward. By his attempts to hold on to the family business of crime, Michael's family splits and at the end of the film, he sits alone, silent, and we the audience are left to reflect with him on the tragedy that is his life. \nThe Godfather Part II is the pinnacle of the epic tragedy. At three hours long it never feels slow paced and never has a dull moment. The Story structure is both intuitive and intelligent. Every production value is top notch and it won numerous awards for it. On top of all that it is one of the best sequels of all time. It brings back everything that was good about the first and provides a script just as if not better written and expands on the story of the original meaningfully and masterfully. It is rather unique in the way that it expands the original both ways, before and after, and never feels disoriented or convoluted because of it. It is a great film in its own right (heck, it won best picture) but gets even better when viewed with the trilogy as a whole (especially the original). It is exactly what a sequel should be while still maintaining the finality and complexity of a standalone film. With all of that going for it, every bit of it the beauty, the violence, the grandeur and the tragedy points to the story and the characters at its center. There in its core is humanity, tragic and imperfect, yet a heart that beats life into a true masterpiece.",

            "content": "Godfather Part II is one of, if not the greatest film ever made. Its a tough call between the first Godfather or this sequel- but I think I actually prefer the sequel. Despite missing Brando's amazing presence- this further continues the descent of Michael Corleone with an all time great performance by Pacino. Dinero is amazing as the newcomer- playing a younger version of Vito Corleone that truly feels like the same man we saw at a much later stage of his life in The Godfather. The dueling storylines are both fascinating, and draw an interesting contrast between the father and the son. \n\nThe father is capable of violence, crime, and theft- but he also has redeeming qualities. He stands up for himself, his family, and his neighborhood, he remains a steadfast and devoted family man/father. Despite his capacity for violence, he isn't a sociopath or psychopath- the violence is well aimed at particular targets. I'm not suggesting that this excuses his behavior necessarily- but Vito unleashes violence on the corrupt Don who murdered his father, mother, and brother. He kills another corrupt Don who threatens and bullies the neighborhood into extortion payments. He is extremely powerful, but not unhinged in his use of this power. \n\nThe son, Michael, on the other hand is every bit as powerful and brilliant as his father- but he is divorced from any moral code. At the beginning of the first Godfather, Michael appears the be the only upstanding member of the family, being not involved in the family crime business. The irony is that we find he has a darker side lurking underneath this appearance, and once he chooses to run the family business in his father's stead- he becomes such a monster that it makes Vito look like a good man. Michael is vindictive, angry, obsessed with power- but for what? Vito does what he does to secure his families future. Michael becomes increasingly detached from the values his father held, and becomes consumed with resentment, rage, and nihilism. \n\nBy the end of this film Michael has fully fallen from grace- becoming purely evil as he has his own brother killed. The final shots of Michael sitting in his chair while becoming enveloped in darkness- fully alone and unhappy- leave the viewer with a haunting image. He is a man who destroyed himself and his entire family in the frivolous pursuit of power and money. The call back to an earlier, more innocent time when Michael was about to join the marines and the Corleone family was intact make the final minutes hit even harder. The acting Pacino gives in the scene where Michael & Kate finally come to blows is absolutely stunning. You can see the quiet rage that constantly simmers beneath Michael's steely, domineering presence. By the end of the film Michael is not only a danger to his enemies and fellow crime lords- he is an immediate threat to the well being of his siblings, wife, and children. \n\nWhat I love about the Godfather films is that they aren't afraid to go in some really dark directions- evoking the feeling of a modern greek tragedy. They aren't necessarily \"fun\" films to watch. But they make you think about fundamental questions of human nature. What is good and what is evil? Can someone who commits violence and crime still maintain a kind of honor or morality? Are we doomed to follow in the footsteps of our parents? What evil lurks beneath regular people who live in a civil society? What might bring this kind of evil to the surface? What happens when power is divorced from morality? \n\nThe more I watch these films the more I appreciate them- they are as challenging and relevant to experience today as they were 50 years ago.",

Pacino is fantastic and the hole left by Brando's Vito is purposely unfilled by Michael's inability to lead benevolently.

This one explores further adventures of Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) reign in the Sicilian Mafia chair and Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) early childhood and young adulthood. In the past, Vito immigrated from Sicily to New York on the run from the Ciccio Mafia after witnessing the death of his father, brother, and mother, and was diagnosed with smallpox upon his arrival. Vito befriends Clemenza (Bruno Kirby) and Tessio (John Aprea) and they steal from mafia boss Don Fanucci (Gastone Moschin). Fanucci later meets Vito and threatens to pay the $600, only for Vito to give \u2018an offer he couldn't refuse,' death. So, in spite of his murder, he becomes head of his own mafia organization, founds his own olive oil trade company, kills Don Ciccio, and welcomes his children: Sonny, Fredo, Michael and Connie. In the present, Michael survives an assassination attempt in Lake Tahoe and suspects it was caused by the Rosato Brothers who were aided by Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), an investor to the Corleone Family who vows revenge after casino owner Moe Greene's death. Michael attempts an assassination on Roth before the new year, but fails once communism takes flight, forcing everyone to flee. Michael returns home, upon hearing the tragic news about Kay's \u2018miscarriage,' as his family gets tried by the FBI, his mother dies, Kay (Diane Keaton) leaves him, Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) commits suicide, and Michael has Fredo (John Cazale) and Roth killed, leaving him in solitude. While not as well-structured as the last film, Part II is still a powerful and satisfying inclusion in the Saga. \n\n(4 \u00bd Oranges from Miami out of 5)",

            "content": "Jeff Barnes \n7/15/18 \n\nThe Godfather 2 \n\tThe Godfather 2 honors The Godfather in many ways with its script and acting, and is about many themes in life such as strength, weakness, and power. The acting as well as the writing very much expands on the characters and the picture honors the original godfather with similar themes, scenes, and set design. However the picture has even slight more imperfection than its predecessor The Godfather. \n\tIn The Godfather 2 the earlier life of former mob boss Vito Corleone is explored while his youngest son Michael seems to can't let go of the criminal acts involving the Corleone family in the past because it contains so much power and control. \n\tThe Godfather 2 precisely examines the subject matter of strength and weakness such as at the beginning of the film when a mafia boss named Francesco Ciccio tells Vito Corleone's at this point Vito Andolini's mother that it's not her son's words he's afraid of but the fact that he'll grow strong when he becomes a man and come for revenge for the death of his father and brother, and it isn't said right out as to why he fears that he'll become strong when he's a man but it's hinted in his face because he has rough and tough looks or expressions on his face and Vito continues to have these rowdy looks through out the film it's noticed that he cries but he never smiles when he's a boy and this is all done tremendously by actor Oreste Baldini.\n\tMeanwhile the character of Michael Corleone is expanded on by being made to realize that being in charge doesn't just mean getting your way all the time but also being powerful and strong but we the audience also realize that having too much endowment can actually lead to vulnerability. Fredo is referred to by his younger brother Michael as weak, and stupid because he allows people to step over him and take advantage of him because he's too insecure to stand up for himself and has difficulty reading between the lines verbally or non verbally such as in the first Godfather film when he works in the family business, and can't comprehend to not take sides against the family or that Moe Green can't be trusted or perhaps the only reason as to why he trusts Moe Green is because he's dangerous, therefore  he doesn't have enough capability or isn't secure enough to not trust Moe Green.\n\t  Fredo also can't read between the lines of a deal that Johnny Ola and Hyman Roth make up that is clearly set up for a hit on his brother Michael. The reason why is because he takes or it appears he takes everything literally instead of figuratively or metaphorically or that he's afraid that he'll get in trouble if he doesn't go along with what anyone says because his brother Michael treats him as a servant by sending him off to do everything for him. \n\tMichael himself becomes weak by wanting too much power. He wants his next child to be a boy because he understands that once the boss in a crime family dies the son is supposed to take over, and it's perceived that he either doesn't believe his son Anthony is capable enough to take over after he dies or that if he has another boy or more boys there will be a bigger line of succession when it comes to taking over the crime family especially since men for many years have been thought of being more powerful than women, but him wanting so much power with wanting more kids and more crime leads to his wife Kay having an abortion because she wants him wanting too much dominance to all end, so in other words by wanting too much dominance Michael gets even less because he wants too much. \n\tThere is even a moment where he hits Kay and this makes him weak because it means that he can't even control his anger because he wants so much endowment that he doesn't want to be limited at all. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has a very fierce and intense look on his face that never seems to stop rising during this moment in the film, and it symbolizes Michael rising too much with his endowment. \n\t   Michael sees his brother Fredo as being weak by not being able to read between the lines of a deal Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola were making however he becomes powerless himself by not being able to read between the lines when his brother Tom Hagen tells him that his wife Kay had a miscarriage, and not being able to apprehend that Kay is really using him so she can have power herself for an abortion because Michael wants so much power that he won't let anyone else have power. \n\tMichael is also feeble with the certainty that he can't bring himself to forgive Fredo because it isn't easy to forgive and all he cares about is power this and power that, which is why he orders his comrade Al to kill Fredo. \n\tJohn Cazale veritably expands on the character of Fredo by really showing his weakness with his expressions particularly when he brings lots of fear to his face the moment after he finds out that Michael knew he was in on the hit during a new years day party, and also when he's sitting slumped over on a chair when he's talking to Michael in a room in Michael's house. \n\tRobert Duvall enlarges on Tom by not only making him genuinely focused but by also genuinely suspicious particularly during a scene when Michael is dealing with a crocked Senator by the name of Pat Geary. \n\tRobert Deniro gives young Vito Corleone the right kinds of emotions at the right times such as when he smiles in a very delightful manner when he sees his friend Genco's pretty sister during a play, but he also makes him look serious and as if he doesn't trust a crocked dealer nicknamed The Black Hand whom he sees at the play. \n\tThe Godfather 2 pays homage to the original Godfather by having many religious themes such as by having it set during Christmas like with having a Christmas tree in Michael's house. It has a day of celebration with Michael's son Anthony's first communion party and the celebration is similar to Connie's wedding celebration in the notion that there's: singing, dancing, music, and food. The communion party is also similar to Connie's child's baptism in the original Godfather. \n\tThe Godfather 2 however is dysfunctional by not adding a little more to Vito Corleone's earlier days or altering his earlier days such as with how he met his right hand man Luca Brasi instead of how he met Clemenza or how he met Hyman Roth, which is strange because one of Michael's associates named Frankie tells Michael that his father: respected Hyman Roth, did business with Hyman Roth, but never trusted Hyman Roth and it's never shown why. \n\tThe Godfather 2 shares plenty of similarities with it processor The Godfather by being ideal and being not quite as good as it but by coming pretty close. I give The Godfather 2 a 9 out of 10.",

A film that has two stories at its arc but both relating to similar things, including how family is important at the same time as trying to build your empire. We see the differences in the two men Michael and Vito. The scenes with De Niro are excellent as his Italian accent seems very natural and its a very interesting and exciting part of the film. Including the murder of one of big  mafia bosses of the time. The way De Niro waits for his target and the way he wanders on the roof stalking his prey is impressive. From the colours here with very bright colours and light in contrast to Nevada where Michael slowly loses control of his family. Pacino again uses his body language and facial expressions to suggest a troubled individual who trusts no one. Again the music is a highlight and is used well around the film. It has elements from the first movie of course but again is used well with the settings and different time periods. The supporting cast are again excellent, from Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. Its nice that they get more screen time and they are important in the family and what is left of Michaels family. A very interesting movie with the court cases, the business deals going wrong in Cuba and the problems with Fredo. The young Vitos scenes in Italy show the life he was brought into and the amazing shots as he approaches New York, including a reflection of the Statue of Liberty in a window room is great camera work and cinematography. A tale of the American dream with the successes and failures and Michael having less and less influence. The party scene is a nice closure and we Michael sitting alone as the rest of the family leave to meet their father. That says so much about Michael where he was and where he is at the end.",

Every character had their own motivations that were understandable and believable. Not to mention the conniving Hyman Roth being an excellent villain. The ending was especially chilling as both protagonists were worlds apart when they achieved the same goal... solidifying their power.\n\nJustice was also done to make the film feel like the eras portrayed. It felt as if I was seeing real scenes of 1920 Italian New York slums and the rise of Las Vegas in the 1950s. Beautiful.\n\nThe only problem I had with The Godfather: Part II was how Robert De Niro looked nothing like Don Vito. Should I hold that against him? Definitely not considering his stellar performance.\n\n5/5. A must-watch for lovers of the Godfather or good films in general.",

This movie suffers a bit from its \"Part II\" status, and overall it's inferior to the first. Don't get me wrong, Coppola is still Coppola with all his genius and attention to detail. Pacino is still Pacino, with and extraordinary performance. The plot is a bit more convoluted than Part I. But many things are not as convincing anymore, starting off with the story that drives the movie.\n\nIt's half sequel half prequel: the sequel is just an operation in Cuba, the prequel is about the birth of the family, of which we already know the outcome. Miles away from the exciting fight for power of the Five Families.\nOne big flaw is the character of Pentangeli, presented as a core member of the family, but never heard of before. It's easily explained by the fact that his character should've been Clemenza himself, but they could't find an agreement to bring back the actor, so they created a new one that feels a bit out of place.\nI've felt more detached from the characters in this part II, and as good as Pacino can be, it's impossible for him to fill the hole left by Brando.\nCuriously enough, with just 20 more minutes this movies feels too long when compared to Part I. This means that something didn't work as intended.\n\nBesides these points, it remains an awesome movie. But if after Part I you can't wait to see the sequel, after Part II you wish you didn't have to witness any more the undoing of the family, or wait remains of it.",

The less time consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into power. The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the conclusion of The Godfather, and shows the means by which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba.

What Coppola was able to capture is something you see only once in a while. The way the movie looks and feels is almost like a documentary. As if we're sharing these experiences with all these different characters. \n\nIt's such a daunting undertaking to take your father's position as head of the mafia and have certain people not respect that. It's crazy to think how rough some of these immigrants had it when they came to America. All the loved ones they left behind. Especially Vito's story, where he came alone when he was just 9 years old. What a greedy pig that boss was that was trying to take from Vito back when he was raising his family of three kids. \n\nI love how the movie goes back forth from Michael's story to his father, Vito. You get to see that they both had to go through some hardships and troubling times where they had to make difficult decisions. That part with the landlord and Vito at his office was hilarious especially seeing how scared he was know that he knew who Vito was. \n\nIt's pretty tragic the things that go on within these mob families.

            "content": "This is definitely not as good as The Gofather (1972) but it's still a very good follow up to one of the most acclaimed films of all time. This is the last of 91 Best Picture winners that I have watched and it's probably one of the best as it's consistently involving for 3 and a half hours and weaves together several different elements to tell a fascinating story. Francis Ford Coppola has made four masterpieces with this, The Godfather, The Conversation (1974) and Apocalypse Now (1979) but this was the only film that he won Best Director for which is ridiculous because he should have three Best Director awards. Of course I would recommend that people watch this film because it is a worthy sequel to a great film and it is extremely entertaining to boot.\n\nThree years after the end of The Godfather Michael Corleone, Al Pacino, has become the most powerful Mob leader in the country and plans to expand his empire despite facing an assassination attempt he believes was organized by his associate Hyman Roth, Lee Strasberg. He continues to do business with Roth even as he tries to have him murdered and faces a serious threat from the investigation of an organized crime commission. We also see how his father Vito Corleone, Robert De Niro, came to America and first became involved in organized crime. When Michael discovers the betrayal of his brother Fredo, John Cazale, and is left by his wife Kay, Diane Keaton, he makes controversial decisions.\n\nMy big issue with the film was that the arc did not feel as strong as that found in the first film as we already know that Michael is evil and willing to do whatever it takes to succeed so his assassination of Fredo had less effect. It's not say that I wasn't engaged in and interested in the story but the dramatic plot beats did not have the same effect as they did in the first film. Yes, it was shocking when I discovered that Kay had her baby aborted instead of having a miscarriage but I cared less about her character than I did about Sonny, James Caan, in the first film or Connie, Talia Shire, who receives so little screen time. The end of The Godfather was so brilliant that it would be difficult to top it and while it could be argued that this film is more quiet and contemplative I still think it pales in comparison when compared to it's predecessor.\n\nThe biggest positives of the film are the performances as Shire and Pacino do some of their best work. Pacino combines the steely resolve he developed in the first film with a touch of sadness as he reminisces about the man he once was with the awareness he can never go back. Shire is fantastic in just a few scenes as we see her as a shameless floosy in her first scene but later witness her attempt to explain her actions and desperately try to convince her brother not to murder Fredo. The performers in the supporting cast are also reliably good as Duvall reprises his role as the loyal Tom Hagen successfully and Strasberg is convincing as the unexpectedly evil Hyman Roth. I don't know if I would have given Best Supporting Actor to De Niro because although he's decent Pacino steals the show from him.\n\nCoppola shows how talented he is as a director here as he weaves together a story that sometimes feels messy to make it coherent and extremely watchable. This film fully deserves the Best Picture award that it won despite strong competition like Chinatown (1974) and Lenny (1974). I wouldn't put it among the top ten Best Picture winners but it's a decision that has aged well and it's rabid fan base proves that it has critical and commercial appeal. Don't go in expecting something excellent but you will get great moments like Tom asking Michael \"Why do you hurt me Michael? I've always been loyal to you\" and really what more could you want from a film than seeing Pacino and Duvall together acting their hearts out, that's what we go to the cinema for.",

            "content": "A deep sequel that parallels father and son.\n\nDirector Francis Ford Coppola proves sequels can be nearly as good, creative, and thoughtful as their original with The Godfather Part II. Coppola challenges the viewer to look further into the depravity of the Corleone crime family. We see Michael Corleone grow older as the ascending Godfather while we witness the origins of Vito Corleone as the first Godfather. Coppola's choice to show these men simultaneously to parallel each other's lives is perhaps the best editing in any movie ever. Similarly, Coppola continues to make relations between Michael and Vito's path to criminality. The Godfather Part II is all about how families are made and break apart. This film establishes the tragedy of Michael Corleone.\n\nRobert De Niro stars as the young Vito Corleone coming from Italy to America. He is as brilliant and kind as the future killer. You get to witness his rise to the status of Godfather. These past sequences are the most engaging and entertaining segments of the movie.\n\nAl Pacino leads the family as Godfather in the present. He devolves into a cruel and calculating murderer unlike his more respectable father. The dichotomy of Michael and Vito is very clever visual metaphor on Coppola's part. He constantly compares their lives and trajectory with visual juxtaposition and unique edits. Pay attention to the transition edits to each era.\n\nThe supporting cast is quite engaging like the first film. Robert Duvall is still steadfast as Tom, Diane Keaton is sympathetic as the brushed aside Kay, Talia Shire is so lovable and misguided as Connie Corleone, John Cazale is pitiable as Fredo Corleone, and Lee Strasberg is contemptible as Hyman Roth. The Godfather Part II succeeds in casting compelling leads and supports throughout the film.\n\nFinally, the music of Nino Rota is comparably beautiful to the magnificent musical compositions in The Godfather. You will have The Godfather's theme song stuck in your head forever. The lush symphonic swells in the countryside to the haunting horns in the city are so memorable. Rota did a fantastic job scoring The Godfather Part II.\n\nIn all, I think The Godfather Part II is a worthy successor to the iconic legacy of The Godfather. It feels quite long and slow in parts, but your attention will be held throughout all the same. I also feel as wonderfully charismatic and horrifying as Pacino acts, he can overact a bit at times. Overall, this is a slick and clever narrative told in a stunningly creative fashion. You'll want to revisit The Godfather Part II every year.",

The cinematography was beautiful, the story was phenomenal, many scenes were memorable, and the soundtrack was still amazing.

Both feel obligated to take on this role for the protection and well-being of their family; however, Michael Corleone proves to be the more ruthless of the two. The reason why this movie does not get a perfect score is because it's slow in some parts and its scenes are not as memorable as the first one.

            "content": "I'm very conflicted about making a final judgement on The Godfather: Part II based on my first time watching it. After I initially watched the first film I thought it was only OK, and definitely not my kind of film. However when I revisited it, I found it was basically a masterpiece. My initial impression of Part 2 is similar to Part 1, it has elements that are excellent but I don't know how much I liked watching it. Even though the drama in this film is within the family and not from the outside, it felt oddly LESS personal. I wasn't sympathizing with Michael like I did in the first movie, even though he was facing opponents from every side. But I want to watch again, because I think when I go back I might appreciate more of the subtlety in what Michael is doing. The part of the film that I found most interesting was actually the flashbacks to Vito's rise to power. I had some minor quibbles with the way it was presented, but most of that stuff was fascinating. De Niro is stellar, and he gets some of the best moments in the film. I'm still trying to decide how I felt about the structure of The Godfather: Part II. The interweaving of Vito's past with Michael's present didn't always make sense to me, and some of the awkward time jumps were jarring. However, I recognize there is quality in this film, I can see the elements that people enjoyed, I just need more time with it and perhaps my appreciation for it will grow.",

Although compared to the novel, Fredo Corleone is portrayed as unfairly stupid, I still loved his character.  He is just so tragic.  All he wants is respect.  I also loved the flashback scenes, as I felt that they had a great authenticity to them.  De Niro was great as a young Vito Corleone.  He was cool and calm, but also a little charismatic and cheeky as well.\n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/oVlpH0",

Pacino, De Niro and the rest of the cast creates a film energy which enthralls the audience.  Pacino's line \"senator we are all part of the same hypocrisy\" resoates the brilliance of the Michael Corleone character.

Al Pacino gives another successful performance as Michael Corleone.  And while the absence of Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone is disappointing, it is made up for by the tremendous performance of Robert De Niro as a younger Vito.\n\nThough the film runs almost three and a half hours long, you'll never once find yourself tapping your foot and looking at your watch; the story is just too interesting for that.  However, even though the stories of Michael and young Vito are both fascinating and will keep you hooked, the way the film jumps between the two stories can be confusing at times.

It is more about the beginnings where Don Vito and his adulthood story and Micheal's side of revenge and frustrations. The longer the film was, the more darker and brutal the scenes go.

            "content": "The Godfather Part 2 has a really really tough act to follow. The first film was loved by pretty much everyone. However Godfather 2 is one of the best sequels ever made, no doubt about it. In this film we get some of the original cast returning, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton but we also get Robert De Niro giving one of the best performances of his career. Francis Ford Copolla returns to direct and just like last time his direction is flawless. The music is absolutely fantastic, the main theme is one of the best pieces of music ever made for a film. This film focuses on two plots, the first one is about Michael Corleone running the family business as he has to deal with attempted murder, betrayals within his inner circle and the law catching up with him. Al Pacino gives another great performance in this movie, I love seeing him as the boss who pulls all the strings, it's really great. The second storyline follows Robert De Niro who plays a young Don Vito Corleone as we learn about his past, see him become a feared man and plot for revenge against the mob boss who ruined his family. Robert De Niro is fantastic as Don Vito, it's probably his second best performance behind Travis from Taxi Driver. This film while not as violent as the original is quite dark, the violence feels more personal and the drama feels more real. In my opinion quite possibly the best part of this movie is the ending. SPOILER ALERT the two ending for the two characters are both very different and it's great to see two types of ending. With Robert De Niro it's a fairly happy ending for him. He's built his way up the crime ladder and is know a feared and respected man, he gets his revenge on the man who killed his family and he has a loving wife and family, he basically has everything he wants. However Michael loses his wife, loses his mother, has to have his brother Fredo killed after he betrayed him and has pretty much lost most of the stuff that matters to him. I feel that is the perfect ending as Michael had everything and now he's lost almost everything that matters. In one of the flashbacks right at the end we see Michael with all his family when they were alive however they all leave the room until he's on his own. You don't get many endings better than this. Overall the Godfather 2 is a fantastic sequel that is one of the few that is able to live up to the originals legacy. This film is close to perfect, it's one of the best movies ever made and one of my favorite movies of all time. This film is in my opinion equal to the first film although if I had to pick one it would be this one. See this film now.  A+",

Al Pacino is great as the lead, and Robert De Niro is equally great as a young Vito Corleone. The storytelling is unique and works very well, telling the main story of the present Corleone family as well as intercutting flashbacks to a younger Vito and the beginnings of the family's entrance to the mafia. It has some excellent writing and terrific performances. The plot is consistently interesting, even if it is a bit long at times. This sequel may even surpass the original, and will be remembered as one of the greatest sequels ever made. The Godfather, Part II gets 4.5/5 stars (A).",

Think of it as a \"continuation\" of the first. Although it has a 200 minute runtime, the well-made story, multi-layered characters, and Oscar-winning performances make the film breeze by. Modern directors can learn from films like this; instead of changing the shot every 5 seconds to a new angle, sometimes it is much better to just leave the camera in one spot and let the actors act. While there are more prologues and footnotes and flashbacks and flash-forwards, the movie still maintains a consistent pace and tone, the mark of a truly great picture.",

With Pacino's compelling performance completing Michael's transformation into a ruthless, moral-torn Mafia boss, Robert De Niro's Academy Awards- winning portrayal of young Vito is a character born from tragic misfortune. With Michael Corleone leading the family, the chronicle of one man's deal with the devil challenges human dilemmas at best: Has Michael's seedy business that's filled with murder and mayhem made him a family man of integrity he thought he is? Or has this so-called business of protecting his family is somehow a desperate measure for one man's rise to totalitarian power? Say what you want 'cause judging from the surprising third-act, Michael has chosen the path of becoming the man he thought he would never be, a one-way ticket without looking back - a fearful man that embodies insecurity and cold-heartedness all in the name of business. However, his father, Vito Corleone was a man of contrast - he fought injustice and would do anything to defend what he once lost as a kid - family. Such simultaneously parallel play on both traits, the kind and compassionate nature against the vile and ruthless tragic hero, had single-handedly shaped one of Coppola's finest period pieces to date.",

It is more about the beginnings where Don Vito and his adulthood story and Micheal's side of revenge and frustrations. The longer the film was, the more darker and brutal the scenes go. It lacks the Italian flavor from its predecessor, yet this is more modern and more like \"get down to business\" Corleone spree. I was not disappointed at all. Epic 4.5 stars out of 5",

I would love to see this film in chronological order, showing the change from De Niro to Brando to Pacino. The latter's portrayal of Michael is as good a performance as you will ever see. A truly great film with wickedly evil characters. The denigration of Michael from his time as the young, unassuming son to the 'Don' is one of the greatest aspects of the trilogy.

            "content": "Unlike its predecessor, a film which trudges along at a slow and somewhat tired pace, The Godfather: Part 2 is filled to the brim with energy and power, never stopping to breathe in a story which packs more human drama than the prior entry into the franchise. The story revolves around the paranoia Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is experiencing after being nearly killed by one of his own, and as he dangerously navigates his alliances, hoping to rid himself of the threat to his family and himself, we see his slow decline into a man who trusts few and goes out no more. As his life breaks down, we sympathize with him on a human level; something that we couldn't do with The Godfather's Vito Corleone, a man who was too powerful to possibly feel anything but respect for. \n\nGordon Willis' cinematography is all lavish and subtle, far more so than the original, and draws little attention away from the characters. His effectiveness in regards to long takes and contrasting colour palettes establish the prowess of the actors and the beautiful scenery with what seems like ease, and he never seems to miss a beat, whether the camera is moving through crowds or through hallways. Coppola advances the scope for the film, addressing multiple timelines and ranging stories over multiple continents, but he ultimately never loses focus of the struggle that the present day Michael Corleone is experiencing, nor the rapid rise of a young Vito Corleone, played expertly by Robert De Niro in an award winning performance. \n\nUltimately, many will still prefer the first film to the second, and one shan't be judged for such; Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone in the original installment can't be challenged by neither Al Pacino nor De Niro's efforts. But what makes The Godfather: Part 2 so much better is its energy. Raw and unbridled, the story moves fluently and without delay, running through the available plots with smart pacing and invigorating effectiveness. As Michael slowly degrades in his ability to control his friends and family, we see that these characters we're viewing are human; as much as we want them to be sure of themselves and to carry through, they can fail. There is more risk and peril in the second part of this series of films, allowing for more drama, and what unravels is a story about trust, lack thereof and morality, and how no one in this world is invincible.",

            "content": "The Godfather Part II is a big surprise for me and I would dare say it is one of the best movies ever made and probably one of the best sequels ever made this is also an example of a sequel that acts as a superior to the original. This movie takes place after and before the events of the first film where Michael Corleone conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. But he also learns that his old companion Hyman Roth is now trying to kill him, Fredo turns against him and his marriage to Kay is now strained. Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies in completing his own corruption. While the events before the Godfather explains the rise of young Vito Corleone and the birth of his son Michael. I seriously love this film and in my opinion this movie seriously surpass the original in many ways and it is the best in the Godfather series since the original if the first film is an outstanding movie with loads of memorable moments that people will never forget, the sequel is a stunning masterpiece that surpassed the original movie. What makes The Godfather Part II a superior to the original is that the film's plot is more intriguing than the original and I love how the movie is focused on two stories in one film one is the origins of the young Vito Corleone the second is the rise and fall of Michael Corleone and Francis Ford Coppola succeeded in combining two stories in one film and he delivers a fresh sequel that is seriously better than the original I mean 100% better than the first film. One of the other highlights of this film is that the film also retains its themes and tones that are similar to the first film's tones and themes even the cinematography, soundtrack and editing as well but even better than in the original plus I also love how this movie is more compelling than the first film and I adore the style and execution of this sequel I was also fund of how this movie further expands the myths and history of the Corleone family and the pacing is almost like the first film. The other highlights of this movie is that this film has loads of scenes that are even more memorable than the first film and there are lots of scenes that are a lot more better than in the first film and they are more memorable than the scenes in the first film I'm serious about it(Hyman Roth's death, Fredo's death, Scenes with the young Vito Corleone portrayed by the great Robert De Niro and the dramatic sequences with Kay and Michael along with Fredo and Michael and the scenes with Michael in Havana)and the look of the film is just captivating and visually stunning at the same time. Now the acting is the second true highlight of this film next to the memorable moments of this film and all of the returning casts seriously exceeded their performances from the first film even the new casts did a very good job with their performances as well. Al Pacino delivered a much better performance in his role as the great Michael Corleone and seriously he delivered an even better performance in this sequel to the first Godfather check out the scene where he talks with Fredo and the scene where he argues and slaps Kay in the face his performance is an Oscar for me. The same can be said to Diane Keaton as Michael's wife Kay along with the other returning casts from the first film. And from the new casts Robert De Niro is the best out of all the new casts and his performance as the young Vito Corleone is an Oscar and Academy award winning performance I love the way he portrayed the young Vito Corleone it seriously fits well for him and this is his best film out of all the films he performed in the later on years in his superb filmography and all of the casts deliver an Oscar performance so far. Director Francis Ford Coppola did a very good job once again in creating another Godfather film and he seriously did a better job with his work on this film than in the first film and he once again turned Mario Puzo's screenplay into a visually stunning masterpiece that beats the original and this film shows proof that Francis Ford Coppola is one of Hollywood's legendary filmmakers in the film industry and he is one smart director when he made one of the best films of all time. The Godfather Part II is an overall stunning movie that surpassed the original thanks to the exceeded performances from the casts and the film's improved and fresh visual style. This movie gets an 11/10. If the first film is an outstanding movie with lots of memorable moments the sequel is a stunning masterpiece with even more memorable moments than the original and this movie will remain as one of the best sequels ever made in the history of cinema.",

Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo continue the Godfather saga by telling the concurrent stories of Vito Corleone's founding of the Corleone crime family in early 1900s, and his son's expansion of the family in the 1950s.  The film is remarkably effective at drawing parallels and continuing themes throughout the two stories.  Additionally, both Al Pacino and Robert De Niro give outstanding performances; especial De Niro, who does an incredible job at mirroring Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone.  Coppola's directing is also amazing, as it draws the audience into the film and makes it an experience.  And, complementing the captivating visual style is a magnificent score from composer Nino Rota, who taps into the soul of the material.  The Godfather Part II is a rich, textured film that connects with its audience on an emotional level.",

Mostly I miss Brando and this second outing is ten times darker. There isn't any hope as Michael's descent into organized crime and simultaneous rise as the new don of the Corleone family. I do enjoy the backstory of Vito, played by Robert De Niro. You can see the like father like son as Coppola once again uses his mastery of juxtaposition and light and dark to convey how one life cannot live with the other and that one man cannot be master of both. There are many spiritual themes in both parts 1 and 2 captured in the intimate moments where lies become hate and death patiently waits in the minds of betrayed and unforgiving outcasts as it picks off anyone and everyone one by one. Michael truly becomes a villain in this story and one that far surpasses the crimes of his father, Vito, in the early days in New York. Vito's struggle is one born of desperation and vengeance. The sins of the father, paved with good intentions, are passed onto the son who turns on anyone who hurts him. Every good word and thought is twisted and all we are left with is one last Hail Mary and a bullet. Life and death.",

            "content": "How do you improve on something that in most regards is considered perfect? You add Robert De Niro, of course! By giving him the original role he auditioned for but set many years in the past, it's great how everything works out like that. It's great that he wasn't put into any supporting roles in the first film because the fantastic acting by him is some of the best. It really shows that he loved the role, as soon as he is introduced he looks very much like a young Vito should, the make up department does it again.\n\nThe Godfather part II is a worthy continuation of the story in the first part, it showcases the rise of Vito Corleone and the decline of Michael's morality and it all weaves together perfectly, both stories are shown at the same time via time skips. At the start the time frame of each story felt evenly dispensed but as the film progressed they began to be individual lengths, sometimes only cutting to Michael's story for a few minutes before going back to Vito's story. \n\nI think it's amazing how well both films are made, considering that this used very little from the book and the first was adapted from the book but left young Vito out of the first film, it's all paced very well and the hefty run time of 3 hours and 20 minutes really does speed by very fast. The story is of course brilliant and has a few twists and turns and it is all very interesting. \n\nBesides that though, the real masterclass here is the acting, this film boasts a huge and distinguished cast of acting legends, everybody here really does do an amazing job, they're all Oscar worthy performances but Robert De Niro was the only acting winner here, it's amazing, he was still relatively unknown at the time and arguably gave one of the best performances in one of the most successful series of all time and all accomplished by speaking about only two lines of English, his career went booming after this and deservedly so. Al Pacino was intense, the decline of his character's morality feels real but he still manages to be a well rounded character, the scenes with his children show that he does genuinely have a care for them. You can tell when he's about to blow, though, it's all in the eyes and it's excellent. Besides the main two, I'm not gonna list everyone because they're all excellent, even when some characters are brought back for a final flashback scene, it's just some of the best acting in history. The music is of course iconic and very memorable and something else that caught my attention was the beautiful cinematography of it all, it was all very clear and very nice to look at. \n\nOverall, it is an excellently made film that raised the bar for all sequels and everything was done amazingly. Perfect acting, amazing story telling and great dialogue, 3 hours and 20 minutes have never been so engaging. I wanted more and I wanted to see it again straight after.",

            "content": "This time I don't get the critical acclaim for this film. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it feels like half a film and doesn't really develop any new themes. This is very much just a finishing of the story that started in the first film. If that one could be subtitled \"The Fall of Michael Coreleone\" this one would be \"The Continuing Fall of Michael Corleone,\" and that just isn't as compelling an arc. I felt the first film basically established where Michael's character was headed and this film simply traces that inevitable development. The moment at the end of the first film where Michael shuts the door on his suspicious wife said everything that you might need to know about where their relationship was headed. And then surprise surprise, they actually do fall apart. A second scene at the end of this film where Michael shuts the door on her is not nearly as powerful as the first, although it achieves its goal of feeling crueller. In all, this felt like the direct continuation of a story that didn't really need a continuation.\n\nMichael's enigmatic stoicism was perfectly fine in the first film since he had several other characters to bounce ideas off of, but here his actions are largely inexplicable. The film ends in several pointless deaths that do nothing to advance his interests and merely represent his wrath. The point is that he has sunk to a completely irredeemable level of vileness and isolation but since we rarely hear his reasoning his descent is basically uncharted. I liked Marlon Brando a lot in the first one, although I didn't understand the overblown praise for his performance, and his presence as a father and mentor is really missing here. Michael shared his thoughts with him a bit more than he does with anyone else. All he has now is his brother Fredo and consiliere Tom, and neither of them are really privy to his inner workings.\n\nRobert De Niro is as amazing in this film as you might expect, though I don't really get why he was cast. With the exception of two or three short phrases in English his entire dialogue is in Italian, a language De Niro doesn't speak. Judging from internet sites he did his usual method acting thing and gets the Sicilian accent and pronunciation perfect, but why didn't they just hire a Sicilian actor to play the part? Or give him some English lines? Any English lines? I get that in Little Italy they'd have spoken largely Italian but they must have used some English.\n\nThe cinematography also seems less impressive than in the last film. While the shots are still good none of them match the distinctive quality of the first film. That one had some memorable scenes, especially when it came to hits or potential hits. Here there is only one memorable hit and it comes towards the end. This is partially a problem with scripting as well of course since the film doesn't really provide many cinematic moments that can be treated in that distinctive clinical yet exotic way. The best scene is the final one, although initially I thought it was pointless and random. It's a flashback to the time before the first film where the whole family was alive and everybody was relaxing before Michael tells them he's joining the army. It tells us nothing about why he became who he did, but as the scene goes on it gets more and more confusing as we are reminded of who Michael originally was. At this point in the film you've forgotten how far Michael has sunk so this completely ordinary scene manages to quite powerfully convey its message without the need for any flashy scriptwriting. He was just an idealistic kid, and while elements of his later life are certainly there (his brooding sullenness for example) it's hard to see the killer lurking in the wings. It's a good scene and a powerful one that manages to completely twist what we've just seen around and returns us to the question of why. But this brings me right back around to my original point: that this film seems just like the end to the last one. I feel like this would be better served as one film so that we could see his fall starting from the beginning instead of coming in halfway.",

The first Godfather was a wonderful stepping stone to this masterpiece of art, and is the only true 'Renaissance' film. Ever since the first film, audiences wanted to see Michael truly taking the position of Don Corleone - and it is breathtaking. Immigration is at the center of the heart. Michael was never meant to be Don even if he believes and truly has what it takes. The Sicilian kind heart of Vito is lost and corruption ensues.

            "content": "Over time, certain events have lead to the sequal of a film exceeding all expectations and actually battering the original into a pulp, The Dark Knight, Terminator 2, some would argue Aliens, guess what, The Godfather Part 2 is also on that list. Now thats not to say that the original isnt worth merit, not at all, infact the original has next to nothing wrong with it, its just that with 25 minutes more, here we manage to fit in so much  more material that your left drooling for its running time. Part 2 is split into 2 segments that flip back and forth throughout the piece. Part one is a continuation of the first film, we follow Michael Corleone 7 years after we left him, struggling to lead a crime free life that he promised his wife Kay, Keaton. His money and efforts have gone into funding casinos and hotels, however this finds him playing a dangerous game and after an assassination attempt on his life, Michael meets with an associate Hymen Roth in order to settle a deal, leaving Tom to protect his family back home. Along the way his family pop up from time to time and a mass web of deciet and muddled plots emerge leaving Michael in one hell of a predicament. The other part to this story is a flashback to the early 1900's where we learn about Don Vito Corleone, about his life growing up, having his children and starting his empire from the ground up. Its a riveting tale and who is better to play the part of a young Brando than the man himself Robert De Niro. He kills it. he literally thumps it out the park and plays Vito down to a T. The sections sound like way too much is going on in them to work side by side however Coppola knows when to run with either angle and the resonation of respect, family and love keep these 2 stories flowing beuatifully. The outstanding script work and cinematography is back, almost identical but not feeling over used. The acting from everyone again is just majestic and the running time doesnt effect the flow at all, it does come with an intermission for viewers with weak bladders or small attention spans. However this film is so brilliantly crafted it just flows perfectly and allowing a pause for me just ruins the flow. Yes there is a lot more to it, its longer and some audience members may not find this a pleasant watch. However its electrifying and heart wrenching story is just too good to miss out on.",

I like this one just a little better because the pacing in this one is much better and I like the presentation they have on this one better. \nNow that that's out of the way, let's talk about The Godfather: Part II. This time around, the story is a little bit different. The story is about how Michael Corleone is trying to expand the family business in Lake Tahoe, Nevada and Havana, Cuba while it's also telling the backstory of Don Vito Corleone before he was a Don. The story is a rise and fall story... Sort of. While Vito Corleone is becoming somewhat famous in New York, his son, Michael Corleone, is ascending deeply and his family is falling apart. Honestly, I feel like I liked Vito's story more than I liked Michael's only because it's more entertaining watching Vito be successful. The score for this movie, composed by Nino Rota,is still amazing with that main theme song stuck in your head for the next few days. The acting is still amazing, but sadly, this movie has no Marlon Brando or James Caan, but we now have the great addition of Robert De Niro which the series needed. De Niro's version of Vito Corleone isn't as good as Brando's role as the older Vito, but he's close. That's pretty much all I have to say...",

The 3rd best movie I've seen, as well as the best sequel and prequel ever made.  Hard to believe the sequel measures up to the original, huh?  If you really pay attention to the film and focus on its narrative and narrative structure, you'll see why some people (including me) consider this on par to the original Francis Ford Coppola masterpiece.  Continuing Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Part II follows two different stories, Michael Corleone in 1958 protecting his family business ventures after a failed attempt of his life, and Vito Corleone escaping from Sicily in 1901, traveling to New York, raising his family, and establishing the Corleone crime family.  This film does everything The Godfather did, but adds a few new things in order to keep up with the cinematic landmarks the original made.  This film does the usual crime formula by adding in tons of graphic violence and language, giving it the traditional look.  Part II also explores a darker look at the American Dream, and exploring themes of morality, family, loyalty, tradition, power, integrity, and responsibility.  Part II also has the ability to change between time periods at the right time, whether it's focused on a certain character or event, it remains well-timed and relevant.  Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo are able to input the incredible storytelling from the first, and are able to keep everything balanced, as well as keep the pace even, despite the fact the sequel is longer, at 3 hours, 20 minutes.  The length allows tons of depth into the film, showcasing tons of emotional complexity, including complex characterization.  Coppola is able to get the most out of his incredible cast, and is able to capture the look and feel of each scene to a fault, showcasing that the first film helped him craft a masterful film that won him an Oscar for his work (as well as writing), despite wrongfully losing for the first film (although he won for writing, and WHY??????!!!!!!).  The cast showcase some of the best performances ever put to film, and main actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are the undoubted best.  Pacino captures everything about Michael, from his emotion and reaction to events, to his devotion to work and family, and lost an Oscar for it (so ridiculous.  **** YOU ACADEMY!!!!!!).  De Niro won his first Oscar by capturing the physical and emotional struggle Vito went through in New York, as well as convincingly speaking Italian for almost all the times he speaks.  Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola capture the mood of each scene, and craft one of the most iconic scores in film history, and Gordon Willis' work as a cinematographer is undeniable as he captures each scene with finesse, and the camera angles help with the music.  This film is true filmmaking at its best, and a must-see for true film fanatics.",

A lot of people would give this full marks but I for one did not think this held up along with the first film. I think maybe Chinatown or The Conversation should have maybe won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nThis film is a continuation of Michael Corleone's position as the Don and detailing on his goal to make the Corleone family legitimate. At the same time, it also shows the beginnings of Vito Corleone. This is, for me, where the good and the bad side of the film is apparent. I'm going to start with the bad side. What made the film so great was that it was really a focus on family and the culture of the Italian people. This film feels like it just focuses on Michael and the consequences of his actions, the destruction of relationships and the creation of enemies. The business being focused on in this film, in Michael's story, doesn't work a lot for me as I find it a little boring. Hyman Roth is so dull as a villain that I did not care whether or not he succeeds or fails. The good side of the film is the focus on Vito Corleone's rise in New York in the early 20th century. It's very fascinating on how he became who he is as it's supported with an interesting villain, Fannuci. The crumbling of Michael's soul is definitely an aspect that I liked, as we felt that he has definitely changed since the beginning of the first film; but I wish the story behind it was just stronger.\n\nCoppola did not exactly screw this film up, it's definitely strong and the more you watch it the stronger it gets but I felt his work on the first was most definitely his best within the trilogy. It was brilliant on how he decided to have this film edited. Juxtaposing the rise of both father and son and how different in the direction both of them go, gives it much more weight and effect. The man pretty much made a sequel and prequel at the same time and not be a disappointment.\n\nGordon Willis, like in the first film, creates this feeling of an old photograph due to the image giving off this golden hue. The film really feels like a period film, and it helps us feel like we are watching a film created in that time. I guess Willis didn't really get much from this film compared to the first because it's not something new. Nevertheless the photography is still strong even today.\n\nThe music here is a little different and at times a little darker but that's just because of Michael's fall from grace. It still has that iconic music by Nino Nota from the first film and when it appears, you get this feeling of nostalgia.\n\nThe acting was excellent as expected. Pacino was able to make this character who was frightening without doing much. There are many moments where this guy feels really ruthless. The supporting cast was also great like the first film but there is a shift in focus on Michael rather than the whole family. In the flashback sequences, Robert De Niro was the only one really focused on and the rest had very little to do. De Niro may have gained more popularity in Scorsese's Mean Streets but I think this is where he really shines and where everybody took notice of him. Lee Strasberg was fine in playing a villain who really doesn't do a lot, he doesn't even feel threatening but Gaston Moschin as Fanuuci was fantastic. The man showed the he owns this side of town and everybody must respect him or else. Overall they are all deserving of credit.\n\nI may be a minority who think this film is not a masterpiece but I just do not find it as strong as the first as Michael's storyline felt flat. The flashback storyline and terrific acting and direction makes this film a must watch.",

The original film had several powerful and transcending scenes that will always be remembered in film history which helped captivate the viewer and cause them to forget about the films length. Unfortunately for me I think that Part II simply does not have as many of these scenes as the original.

I do like the second installment of the trilogy more than the original Godfather film, no disrespect to Marlon Brando and James Caan, who was absolutely brilliant in the first film. But this film was so wonderful, with the conspiracy and betrayal plot, it was absolutely intriguing! I also like Michael's (Pacino) transformation from the reluctant successor to the full-fledge Godfather, but I guess you can't appreciate the character's evolution without having seen the first film, so in that way the first and second film really compliment each other well. The performance of the cast was marvelous, what a stellar ensemble, they all did a beautiful job and there wasn't a dull or unconvincing performance in the group, even Diane Keaton (who plays Kay Adams), whom I felt gave the least convincing, weakest performance in the entire film but still wasn't as bad as the performance of some leads in movies now-a-days.

Robert De Niro as a young Vito Corleone is a strong addition to the movie and it provides a lot of insights from this character we didn't know much about in the first movie. The parallel between father and son is shown skillfully and the movie keeps you invested and paying attention.

            "content": "It is practically common knowledge among film nerds that a large majority of sequels to critically acclaimed films result in mediocrity for nearly every sequel is usually far inferior to the original. The reason sequels usually are not as good as the originals is because filmmakers often don't know what worked about the original and end of either retreading the same exact plot of the first film or making a huge tone shift from the original. One example of a sequel that does retread the first film exactly is Back to the Future Part II which quite literally shows the exact same footage as the first film just with different perspectives. While there are many awful sequels like Superman IV the Quest for Peace and Star Wars Episode I the Phantom Menace, there are several amazing sequels like Star Wars Episode V the Empire Strikes Back and The Dark Knight. Every great sequel explores the depth of their characters even more with new and unique stories rather than retreading old ideas and perhaps the greatest sequel of all time is Francis Ford Coppola's follow up to his masterpiece, The Godfather, with The Godfather Part II. I was given the privilege of witnessing both Part I and Part II in theaters with a 6 hour and 30 minute Godfather marathon; while certainly long seeing both back to back perfectly displays the uprising and downfall of Don Vito Corleone's son Michael who I personally view as not only the main character but also the most complex and memorable. The Godfather Part II parallels two separate characters' lives, Vito and son Michael Corleone which besides creating a more unique narrative also serves to further contrast the moral state of both men. Coppola could have easily just focused on Michael's story yet he understood the importance of Michael's own moral suicide, so to further express that aspect of the character the director chose to show the early life of Vito Corleone as a more morally respectable man. The characters of this universe are incredibly well realized while always feeling like real people for it is the characters that make The Godfather series such a memorable addition to the gangster genre.  Of course the man behind the camera is the person responsible for creating such a fantastic film and that is writer, producer and director Francis Ford Coppola who is practically a god among film fanatics. He is a true artist of presentation for every single frame of this film humongous 3 hour and 20 minute running time is meticulously crafted aided exponentially by the beautiful soundtrack that easily is on my top five favorite soundtracks of all time. The presentation of Part II and Part I for that matter is the true definition of masterful. My one piece of criticism for this entry in the series is simply that Michael's general plot line is somewhat convolutedly told with not a whole lot of explanation to certain characters and or events, I felt the first film was much stronger in terms of general plot. While The Godfather is indeed a better film, that goes without saying considering the original is a masterpiece of cinema; however the fact that The Godfather Part II is almost as good as the original is an incredible feet because it means that this film is an amazing film. The Godfather Part I-II both culminate into a historic achievement in American film making that is nearly flawless.",

This film has an even broader scope than the original, but does not fall into making the film bigger because thats what sequels should do, its bigger because it needs to be.

            "content": "This film is a sequel to one of the most celebrated films of the 70's. A lot of people would give this full marks but I for one did not think this held up along with the first film. I think maybe Chinatown or The Conversation should have maybe won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nThis film is a continuation of Michael Corleone's position as the Don and detailing on his goal to make the Corleone family legitimate. At the same time, it also shows the beginnings of Vito Corleone. This is, for me, where the good and the bad side of the film is apparent. I'm going to start with the bad side. What made the film so great was that it was really a focus on family and the culture of the Italian people. This film feels like it just focuses on Michael and the consequences of his actions, the destruction of relationships and the creation of enemies. The business being focused on in this film, in Michael's story, doesn't work a lot for me as I find it a little boring. Hyman Roth is so dull as a villain that I did not care whether or not he succeeds or fails. The good side of the film is the focus on Vito Corleone's rise in New York in the early 20th century. It's very fascinating on how he became who he is as it's supported with an interesting villain, Fannuci. The crumbling of Michael's soul is definitely an aspect that I liked, as we felt that he has definitely changed since the beginning of the first film; but I wish the story behind it was just stronger.\n\nCoppola did not exactly screw this film up, it's definitely strong and the more you watch it the stronger it gets but I felt his work on the first was most definitely his best within the trilogy. It was brilliant on how he decided to have this film edited. Juxtaposing the rise of both father and son and how different in the direction both of them go, gives it much more weight and effect. The man pretty much made a sequel and prequel at the same time and not be a disappointment.\n\nGordon Willis, like in the first film, creates this feeling of an old photograph due to the image giving off this golden hue. The film really feels like a period film, and it helps us feel like we are watching a film created in that time. I guess Willis didn't really get much from this film compared to the first because it's not something new. Nevertheless the photography is still strong even today.\n\nThe music here is a little different and at times a little darker but that's just because of Michael's fall from grace. It still has that iconic music by Nino Nota from the first film and when it appears, you get this feeling of nostalgia.\n\nThe acting was excellent as expected. Pacino was able to make this character who was frightening without doing much. There are many moments where this guy feels really ruthless. The supporting cast was also great like the first film but there is a shift in focus on Michael rather than the whole family. In the flashback sequences, Robert De Niro was the only one really focused on and the rest had very little to do. De Niro may have gained more popularity in Scorsese's Mean Streets but I think this is where he really shines and where everybody took notice of him. Lee Strasberg was fine in playing a villain who really doesn't do a lot, he doesn't even feel threatening but Gaston Moschin as Fanuuci was fantastic. The man showed the he owns this side of town and everybody must respect him or else. Overall they are all deserving of credit.\n\nI may be a minority who think this film is not a masterpiece but I just do not find it as strong as the first as Michael's storyline felt flat. The flashback storyline and terrific acting and direction makes this film a must watch.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers... but I assume you've already seen the film... right?\r\n\r\nI'll undoubtedly get shit for this, but I like The Godfather Part II more than the original. I know, I know... tear me apart, Rotten Tomatoes. But this sequel really sets the bar for sequels in general, and I thought it was fantastic. To be clear: I loved The Godfather, but only gave it 7/10 because I have been told by my parents for years that it was a religious experience, so I went in with impossible expectations. I'll probably revisit it sometime when I've had a chance to think on it.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Part II is a masterpiece. Most films that jump between storylines end up as a patchworked mess (I'm looking at you, Julie and Julia), but this is really exceptional storytelling. Moving between Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) empire's workings in the present and Don Vito's (Robert De Niro) origin story in the early 1900s, it works as a mesmerizing parallel between father and son in the best way possible.\r\n\r\n My two favorite actors of the time period are in the starring roles, so there really wasn't much of a chance that I wouldn't like this. De Niro does a fantastic Marlon Brando impersonation, and is fantastic to watch as he impresses even himself with his capability to bend others to his will. Pacino is meanwhile given the difficult task of rooting out betrayal amongst his ranks, leading to the goosebump-inducing line \"You broke my heart, Fredo. You broke my heart.\"\r\n\r\nOther incredible and memorable moments include the origin of \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse,\" and of course, the tale behind the coining of the phrase \"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\" As always, the rest of the cast is just as spellbinding as the leads, which is bolstered mostly by Robert Duvall's work as the distant and intractable lawyer Tom. \r\n\r\nThe brother VS brother aspect of the film is really taken to the max, when Michael disavows Fredo and refuses to speak to him ever again. When he orders his own brother's death, it's a powerful fucking moment. He stands at the bay window of his Lake Tahoe mansion, watching as Fredo is shot while fishing out on a boat. I can't write a review as Shakespearian as the dialogue in this movie, so I feel like I'm not living up to the standards... so I'll just say it's powerful, powerful fucking shit.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for The Godfather Part II: 9/10 stars. As always, a four-hour movie will have its fair share of somewhat unnecessary scenes, but this film is practically watertight. I can't think of many scenes I'd cut off the top of my head. But like I said, it may not be my favorite over the first... I just had my expectations built up too high for the original. So I'll revisit it soon, whenever I feel like sitting down and watching a movie for four hours.\r\n\r\nAlso, how cool would it be if in Finding Dory, Marlin's last name is revealed to be Brando? That would fucking RULE.",

Since I added 'The Godfather' to my Great Movies list, it's only fair that I add 'The Godfather: Part II', because - after all - it is a better movie. And that's saying a lot.\r\n\r\n'The Godfather: Part II' is everything the first film is not. The first film is a Hollywood motion picture to the umph degree. The story structure is the basic three act structure. The second film is contemporary and sporadic. The story chaotically swings one way, and then another. It is suspenseful and imaginative, and damn good filmmaking.\r\n\r\nMichael is now the Don, with Fredo and Tom as his only brothers left. Trying to rack up more political power in Nevada, they're new location, Michael makes enemies fast. The only question: Who is the enemy? It could be a number of people: Hymon Roth - Vito's old business buddy, who may be trying to cut Michael out of the business deal in Cuba. Frankie - The head of the Clamenza family. Frankie is angry at Michael for doing business with his enemies, the Rosatta Brothers. Along the way, more and more suspects, yet the actual link is a surprise to both us and Michael.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that we discover the foe at the midpoint of the film. Through the second of the movie, we see Michael's world falling apart in front of his eyes. All this playing against a second story: The past life of Vito Corleone. It is interesting that Michael makes many of the same choices that his father makes. But, as Michael says, \"Times are changing.\" Indeed, they are. Vito lives in prosperity with his wife and children for the rest of his life, while Michael loses everything he loves.\r\n\r\nOf course, the other obvious difference is the production value, which is much more gratuitous. Every inch of the frame in every shot is filled with beautiful images. Extras by the thousands, massive sets, incredible costumes. But, the movie wisely doesn't over produce. The streets are still dirty, and the windows have fingerprints. The camera operation is widely enhanced, and again, more contemporary than its predecessor. Copolla focuses more on abstract shots, while maintaining the epic spirit of the first film.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the story is simply more engulfing. The relationship between Kay and Michael is the greatest screen relationship of all time. It's the only thing that saved 'The Godfather: Part III\". I wish there were more scenes between them in this film. The sequence where Kay reveals the truth about a certain accident is both shocking and intriguing. Diane Keaton; what happened to her? She used to do movies like this! Now she does films like, \"Because I Said So\". How did this happen? Please, Diane Keaton, do more films like this! Same goes for Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, both of whom do great in this movie. You do a film like 'The Godfather: Part II' and then start taking roles in trite like 'Righteous Kill'?\r\n\r\nI can't recommend the film enough. It's beautiful, and the score is breathtaking. What an influencial movie. Probably, I'd say, one of the most important movies ever made, not just for what it did for the film industry, but for what it accomplished in popular culture and political influence. How truly wonderful to witness a part of history. 'The Godfather: Part II' is a relic, a holy artifact that will live on in the same light as The Mona Lisa.",

There's something about the very nature of a sequel that somehow means it can't be as good as what came before it- this film defies that and gets away with it- why? Well, who'd wanna start a fight with Pacino or De Niro  as they are here!?\n\nWhen you watch this it quickly becomes clear that the first instalment was just that- an instalment, it was always going to go hand-in-hand with this one and that meant that not only would the sequel be as good, it would also be better thanks to the first film providing an exceptional framework for the next section of the story. The same can't really be said for the last instalment of the trilogy though and that's why The Godfather: Part 2 is my favourite of the three.\n\nIf you look at each element separately- this film should be a failure, nothing more than pasting parts of Puzo's work that couldn't be fit into the first instalment. Of course, it isn't quite like that- this screenplay is planned and executed down to a tee which makes for a more satisfying watch than the first movie and makes for an all round better experience.\n\nThe real magic with this one is that it expands out without ever compromising what made the first film so great- nothing is lost here, simply more added. I swear it's movie trickery because that's just not something you'll see in many other sequels. \n\nNow despite this often being hailed as the best sequel in film history, it's still often seen as inferior to the first instalment and I entirely understand why- there is no doubt that this covers loose ends and that it has it's own loose ends also- it breaks tension through multiple stories and seems disorganised at times but the thing we need to remember is that, despite this, nothing fails in this film- it's gripping and exceptional, just as the first was, from start to finish. The first film has no flaws to overcome, it's a master of it's own destiny, this sequel didn't have it so easy, but it succeeded triumphantly anyway.\n\nThe stories of the Corleones are told so well that it just doesn't make sense to say that having more of them, as is the case here, is a bad thing.",

The screenplay which like its predecessor is written by Puzo and Coppola is again a masterwork, and Coppola is very skilful in making sure that the two storylines gel naturally and letting the film run smoothly but with great intensity.

When I watch a gangster movie, I felt that the element of brutality was something that was lacking in the first Godfather, in that it came off too pretty and sophisticated, but I actually came to appreciate its dynamics in that the brutal scenes come as the plot escalates in that it serves as a contrast to the more sombre, melancholic elements of the film. I have to say that it brought forth something unique with that concept and gave the film a sense of grandeur that made it stick out in the crime genre.\n\nAnd the things The Godfather did in setting the bar, Part II further expands on its ideas and opts for a darker, malevolent approach that greatly differs from the first film that has more of a sense of warmth. To see Michael's transformation was astounding in the first film, but to see what he has become is gutwrenchingly heavy. What Don Vito Corleone created was a foundation for his family, and to see Michael become corrupted to the point, he would do anything to stay at the top is horrifyingly disturbing. What makes this performance so intense is the lack of any human emotion or empathy coming from Michael, that makes him just pure evil. What is brought to this role is the stuff of legends and I cannot give enough credit to Al Pacino. He deserves every amount praise bestowed upon him, but who I think shines just as much as Al in the film is Robert De Niro and his portrayal of a young Vito Corleone during his rise to power. I would have never thought it would feel natural to have someone other than Marlon Brando portray the original Don, but Robert De Niro actually exceeded my expectations. From his accent to his mannerisms, he got the character down to a hair.\n\nAnd not only with great performances, we are offered a great character study contrasting a father and son, and what drives these men to kill. We know how Michael came into his position, but as the film progresses we begin to see how Vito and Michael handle their business, as we see both their stories reach a conclusion that is downright brutal. The Godfather Part II shows what is set forth by Michael's rise to power and the movie retains its ambition, but becomes its own film that is gripping and memorable in its own unique character.\n\nI originally preferred the first one, but then I realized how much the second one is dependent on the first film. While the second one is more gripping, the first one is grandiose in that it was the first to bring out these great ideas and execute them in a way that is incomparable, but I like to see the first and the second as one long epic story in that it depicts the rise and fall of an empire and while I prefer the first one, the sequel does something different, adding different angles to the story that are equally as compelling, dramatic and shocking as the first one. To make a sequel that does just that was no easy feat and this is the mark of Francis Ford Coppola's talent as a director. Even if the first Godfather were to never have a sequel, it would still be awesome on its own, but to have a sequel that is this good is more than anyone could ask for from a great director. The Godfather Part II is a film that you should definitely not miss out on.",

We pick up a few years later than where The Godfather left off, with the Corleone family now firmly entrenched in Las Vegas.  But Michael (Al Pacino) just seems burdened by responsibilities and mostly he's a drag. Lee Strasberg is pretty great as his crime boss nemesis, however, and John Cazale is heart-breaking as weak brother Fredo.  There are some great set-pieces (in Cuba, in the Senate hearing, and in all those very dark shots by Gordon Willis). We also get to see Vito's early days (with De Niro aping the mannerism of Brando) and these also have a vitality and suspense that makes you wish there was a whole film taking place in this era.  But, in the end, the viewer gets ground down, just as Michael Corleone does (and Part 3 belongs to a very different Pacino).",

Silently swimming and killing his prey without emotion. It's just business. The flashback sequences give a rich depth to the back stories and helps to explain who these people are and the world they populate.  A world of power, of loyalty and betrayal, and of a silent but underlying greed that propels the protagonist.  \nI give this my highest rating. Two trigger fingers up.",
