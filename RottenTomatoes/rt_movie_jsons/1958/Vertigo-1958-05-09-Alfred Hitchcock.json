            "content": "I started watching classic films sophomore year of high school in a film appreciation class. Despite the class name, I found myself struggling to appreciate many of the films that are on AFI's Top 50. The slow pace and old timey subject matter of black and white films did not hold my interest. Then I saw Vertigo and I instantly loved it. \n\nVertigo transported me into a land of suspense and mystery. The story was a puzzle trying to be solved by characters I cared about. It was part psychological thriller, part mid-life crisis, with a deadly romance and tragic characters. Vertigo has it all. It's also Alfred Hitchcock's best film. And that's saying something.\n\nIn 2012, The British Film Institute hailed Vertigo the greatest film ever made and they have a point. Based on the French novel From Beyond the Dead, the film adaptation changes the setting from Paris during WWII to San Francisco during peacetime. The story and cinematic ingenuity is so strong in Vertigo that the plot translates perfectly. \n\nVertigo opens with an insane amount of exposition. During a roof top chase, Detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) is unable to catch a criminal due to a fear of heights. The chase results in the death of a police officer and Scottie is forced into early retirement. Scottie is more restless than bitter and James Stewart embodies the character's optimism, obsession, and relatability.\n\nA hero is only as good as its villain and Vertigo has one of the best. Gavin Elster hires Scottie to follow his wife Madeline in an elaborate scheme to kill her. When Madeline commits suicide by jumping off a San Juan Batista Mission tower, Scottie can't follow her up the stairs. But what Scottie doesn't know is that the Madeline that ran up the stairs was an impersonator named Judy Barton. The real Madeline is already dead and her corpse was thrown off the tower. Scottie is the only eye witness and believes it was a suicide. Gavin's plan is going perfectly.\n\nBut what Gavin doesn't predict is that Scottie and Judy have fallen in love. Judy is played by Kim Novak so it's difficult not to fall for her. Judy was also Gavin's mistress and Gavin didn't want Madeline to find out about the affair and take everything. What I love about Hitchcock is that he doesn't spoon feed the audience. The mystery is a slow reveal and he waits for the 3/4 mark to reveal that Judy was Madeline all along. \n\nKim Novak plays Madeline as a bewildered space cadet who is obsessed with recreating her great-grandmother's suicide. Hitch is a genius. This is a messed up story told without irony. The audience's dark and twisted obsession with death, suicide, madness, and marital affairs is reflected in Madeline and Scottie's own interest. The plot isn't happening to these characters. They are actively creating their own demise because they can't help themselves. They are audience surrogates and viewers get to live vicariously through the tragic lovers' obsession.\n\nAfter Madeline's apparent suicide, Scottie sees Judy in a restaurant and is fixated on her resemblance to Madeline. Scottie's fixation is born out of clinical depression and we don't know what to think of it until it's revealed that he's right. Seeing the woman you love commit suicide because she thinks that she's the reincarnation of her great-grandmother renders Scottie almost catatonic. And it's the reincarnation angle that plays into Scottie's fantasy when he sees Judy eating dinner. \n\nHitch has been laying out the clues perfectly. Everything that is revealed has significance later on which makes rewatching Vertigo a super rewarding experience. Judy has a moment of truth. She can tell Scottie the truth about Gavin's murderous plan but she doesn't. She continues the charade of being Madeline. But Scottie figures it out when Judy wears a family heirloom necklace that she could have only gotten from Gavin. \n\nIf only Judy had told Scottie the truth earlier things might have been different. But Judy seals her fate. Scottie's obsession flips from romantic to crime solving. The ill-fated lovers return to the San Juan mission so that Judy can explain to Scottie what happened. But karma has other plans for Judy. At the top of the mission Judy is scared by a nun (who represents justice) and falls to her death. \n\nTo call Vertigo a technical achievement is an understatement. The psychedelic and surreal dream sequences are filled with neon colors, silhouettes, and strange angles. Saul Bass's eerie title sequence mirrors this look. To achieve the vertigo effect from Scottie's POV, Hitch's camera would pull back and zoom in at the same time. Vertigo is film noir in color and there's ample use of shadows and background lighting. \n\nHitchcock invented these visual techniques to aid his story. Bernard Herrmann's genius score keeps the film thumping along. There's an alternate ending where Gavin is being chased across Europe for his crimes. In the film, Gavin was never caught but it's a fair assumption that he will be. Hitchcock fought to end the film on the bleak note of Judy's death. Classic Hitch. He quit while he was ahead in a deliberate move to keep the audience wanting more. \n\nThe whole film is melodramatic perfection. Vertigo represents what film was capable of up until 1958. James Stewart acts against type while still being an every-man. He literally believes the woman he loves has come back to life. Scottie, of course, is living a lie. Kim Novak plays three characters \u2013 regular Madeline, crazy Madeline, and Judy. Her performance is stunning and far transcends that of a Hitchcock blonde. Her guilt and angst are believable and moving. \n\nVertigo was released during Hitchcock's most prolific period from Rear Window (1954) to Birds (1963). Never before or since has a director had a better professional decade. Newsweek film critic David Ansen said it best, \"Why is this movie Hitchcock's masterpiece? Because no movie plunges us more deeply into the dizzying heart of erotic obsession.\" Hitch is England's greatest director and he proves that here.",

He began filming it after the funding for his television show filled the budget for what he would then use to invent new camera techniques. James Stewart was a lock-in for the time, as he had previously starred in \"Rear Window.\" The result is timeless. It is a suspenseful thriller with many twists. Some people like the binoculars scene in \"Rear Window,\" and others like the shower scene in \"Psycho,\" but these scenes overshadow those by way of ingenuity and even execution. To me, \"Psycho\" is oversimplified, and \"Rear Window\" doesn't pack enough punch.",

When a former university friend asks Scottie (James Stewart) to discreetly follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), whose erratic behavior concerns him from a mental health perspective, events begin to unravel in unforeseen ways.  While it is entertaining with some interesting twists, there are questions to be asked.  How did Scottie escape from the rooftop dilemma in the opening scene? Is the relationship that develops between Scottie and Madeleine realistic, based on their ages?  Was the silly dream sequence, replete with corny animation and flashing colors, necessary?  Without giving too much away, was there an easier way for Scottie's friend to meet his devious objective?  Is the seemingly non-stop score necessary? And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

            "content": "After a rooftop chase, where a fellow policeman falls to his death, San Francisco detective John \"Scottie\" Ferguson (James Stewart) retires due to fear of heights and vertigo. Scottie tries to conquer his fear, but his ex-fianc\u00e9e, underwear designer Marjorie 'Midge' Wood (Barbara Bel Geddes), says that another severe emotional shock may be the only cure. Gavin Elster, an acquaintance from college, asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak), claiming that she has been behaving strangely and her mental state is abnormal. Scottie reluctantly agrees and follows Madeleine to a florist where she buys a bouquet, to the Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds and the grave of Carlotta Valdes (1831\u20131857) and to the Legion of Honor art museum where she gazes at the Portrait of Carlotta. He watches her enter the McKittrick Hotel, but upon investigating, she does not seem to be there. A local historian explains that Carlotta Valdes committed suicide: she had been the mistress of a wealthy married man and bore his child; the otherwise childless man kept the child and cast Carlotta aside. Gavin reveals Carlotta (who he fears is possessing Madeleine) is Madeleine's great-grandmother, although Madeleine has no knowledge of this and does not remember the places she has visited. Scottie tails Madeleine to Fort Point and when she leaps into the bay, he rescues her. The next day, Madeleine stops to deliver a letter of gratitude for Scottie, and they decide to spend the day together. They travel to Muir Woods and Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, where Madeleine runs down towards the ocean. Scottie grabs her and they embrace. The following day, Madeleine visits Scottie and recounts a nightmare. Scottie identifies its setting as Mission San Juan Bautista, the childhood home of Carlotta. He drives her there and they express their love for each other. Madeleine suddenly runs into the church and up the bell tower. Scottie, halted on the steps by his acrophobia, sees Madeleine plunge to her death...\n\nThe initial reception expressed in film reviews for Vertigo was mixed. Variety wrote the film showed Hitchcock's \"mastery\", but felt the film was \"too long and slow\" for \"what is basically only a psychological murder mystery\". Similarly, Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times admired the scenery, but found the plot took \"too long to unfold\" and felt it \"bogs down in a maze of detail\". Scholar Dan Auiler says that this review \"sounded the tone that most popular critics would take with the film\". However, the Los Angeles Examiner loved it, admiring the \"excitement, action, romance, glamor and [the] crazy, off-beat love story\". The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther also gave Vertigo a positive review by explaining that \"[the] secret [of the film] is so clever, even though it is devilishly far-fetched.\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post praised the film as a \"wonderful weirdie,\" writing that \"Hitchcock has even more fun than usual with trick angles, floor shots and striking use of color. More than once he gives us critical scenes in long shots establishing how he's going to get away with a couple of story tricks.\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote Hitchcock \"has never before indulged in such farfetched nonsense.\" (via Wikipedia)\n\nThis film noir psychological thriller film directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock is often cited today as a classic Hitchcock film and one of the defining works of his career. Personally I agree to what Variety wrote back in 1958, that the film shows Hitchcock's \"mastery\", but the film is \"too long and slow\" for \"what is basically only a psychological murder mystery\". The storyline never really excites you nor entertains you despite solid performances from James Stewart and Kim Novak. It simply never lifts of the ground. And Hitchcock\u00b4s attempt to create a psychological thriller just becomes uneven and a bit scattered to me. The best part of the film is Graphic Designer Saul Bass title design and graphic design. \"Vertigo\" is not amongst Hitchcock\u00b4s great ones in my book at least. \n\nTrivia:  It is the first film to use the dolly zoom, an in-camera effect that distorts perspective to create disorientation, to convey Scottie's acrophobia. As a result of its use in this film, the effect is often referred to as \"the Vertigo effect\". Graphic Designer Saul Bass used spiral motifs in both the title sequence and the movie poster, emphasizing what the documentary Obsessed with Vertigo calls, \"Vertigo's psychological vortex\". Bass's unconventional framing of Kim Novak's facial features in the first images of the titles was indebted to Bauhaus photography.",

The beauty of \"Vertigo\" extends through the spectrum of visual allure and thematic profundity; the story haunts and resonates in us even as it carefully eludes our ultimate grasp. It is, in other words, a film that is simply a treasure to puzzle over. We watch captivated by the richly ironic and emotionally devastating experience of Scottie's infatuation with the untenable mirage of a woman's identity even as the real thing is ever available to him. That which he seeks is perpetually out of grasp precisely because he can't come to terms with the ease of its nearness, resulting in a search that inevitably grows more and more frantic as the thicket of self-imposed illusion overwhelms him and, in a way, us. Watching the film, I was moved by the seamless way in which one mystery flowed into another, gradually revealing ever deepening layers of haunting psychological implications. \"Vertigo\" thus earns its reputation as one of the master's best works, even as its sedate rhythms and esoteric leanings evoke an entirely different experience of suspense.",

They are a trillion times worse than this without a shadow of a doubt.\n\nWhat makes this movie great? When I re watched this, I got goosebumps. It is quite chilling, suspenseful and extremely haunting. The complex plot tells of a retired cop with a terror of heights who is hired by Gavin Elster to follow his suicidal wife. In the end, he falls in love with her but can't stop her falling to her death. Months later he sees a woman bearing strong resemblance to her, and is drawn into a web of deceit and obsession. There are so many strong moments here, especially Scotty following Madeline up the tower only to witness her falling to her death, but also of the San Francissco locations giving a dreamlike quality to an already dark and complex movie. The screenplay is sophisticated and sharp as well. And I have to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it was phenomenal, along with Miklos Rosza's score for Spellbound and Hermann's for Psycho this is the most memorable score in any Hitchcock film, and is guaranteed to have your hairs standing up on the back of your necks.\n\nThe direction from Hitchcock is simply masterly. The cinematography isn't dated at all. It is stylish and full of contrasts of dark and bright colours, and is also very brooding and intense. I had very little problem with the film's pace and length; in fact let me rephrase that I had no problem with it. I felt actually that Torn Curtain had a much slower pace, and for me that film while good is one of my least favourite Hitchcock movies. The acting I thought was exceptional. Kim Novak starts off a little wooden, but she is certainly very beautiful and enigmatic. In the duel role of the suicidal wife and the woman bearing resemblance to her, she does an in general excellent job, considering both are extremely demanding roles. About James Stewart, whether he was a racist I don't know, but simply I don't care. Whether you are racist or not, it shouldn't matter when it comes to acting and films. What matters is that Stewart was a great actor who rarely gave a bad performance. In this film, he gives one of his best performances, shattering his Mister-Nice-Guy persona with a dark, brooding and truly complex characterisation. Barbara Bel Geddes also gives a terrific performance as Midge.\n\nAll in all, a superb film, that deserves recognition as one of Hitchcock's best films. Seriously, it is one of the most effective depictions of romantic fatalism in all of cinema. An unforgettable masterpiece, 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The portrayal of the failure of the heterosexual (or really any couple) relationship and the impact of obsession and mental illness has never been so well portrayed. The colour photography and the use of locations intercut with studio shots is right up there with the best the Master has ever produced. Stewart gives a profound sense of the character of a man who has lost touch with reality and lives on the boundaries of madness. Novak and Bel Geddes are also superbly cast. Contains some of the greatest scenes in the cinema including the hotel room sequence with the unforgettable green neon light, the Golden Gate sequence and the department store sequence. The score is one of the greatest ever written for film and adds a huge amount. As near to perfection as the cinema can get. \"God have mercy\" on us all, especially obsessive males. \"Each man kills the thing he loves.....\"",

It was all very creepy and dreamlike.\nWatching it again as a young adult, I realized that it wasn't just a scary movie. I understood the dilemma of Novak's character, having to change her clothes and hair to please Jimmy Stewart. I understood the male obsession of remaking a woman into some kind of fantasy sex object. I was discovering misogyny.\nAs a mature adult, I'm now able to see the film for both its mastery and its flaws. The cinematography is breathtaking. Bernard Hermann's score is a work of art unto itself. \nAs to its flaws, the elaborate murder plot, of course, is absurd. But then, most movie murder plots are. There are also some scenes with \"goofs\" that went undetected the first couple of times I watched it. \nBut the overall effect of the film has remained the same over all of the decades: This is cinema at its highest level, possibly the greatest movie of all time.

The visuals are groundbreaking and massively influential for 1958, and the performances from Stewart and Novak are mostly faultless. As a Hitchcock film, the atmosphere is exemplary and the score by Bernard Hermann is downright spectacular. The story is fresh and unique for Western cinema, although digestion is needed before reaching a conclusive verdict on whether or not the relationship between the main character and the women in his life is ironic and self-referential or not. Additionally, the second half of the film drags in contrast to the first. I enjoy the subversion of the conventional film structure by allowing the suspense to build further by having the action completely fall away at the halfway point, but Novak and Stewart seem aimless and repetitive in their displays in a series of events that could have been trimmed considerably. This being said, it makes the final climax and ending all the more satisfying. That key damaging gripe aside, Vertigo is a superb piece of filmmaking.",

All the driving around, following that green car got tedious. The Midge character and her scenes seemed unnecessary, or could've been cut to one fewer.  Editing was still needed, imo. The maudlin, melodramatic music I know was much in vogue at the time, but I strikes me as overplayed. \nHitchcock sure as hell had women issues. He again has a woman torture a man's mind, but at least he makes Judy a sympathetic character. The acting is suspect at times as well.

The great aspect of the romance is its inherently toxic nature; neither of the pair are good-natured, but are instead rather self-serving, greedy, and possessive, and Stewart and Novak bring out these nuances rather brilliantly. The only major flaw is the ending, an area where I have found Hitchcock to be characteristically weak, opting for pure melodrama, anticlimax, or uncharacteristic humor. I am of the opinion that Vertigo is largely fantastic and a great representative of the director's work, but that Sight & Sound could do far better in terms of the singular greatest film ever made.

            "content": "Listed by Sight and Sound as the greatest film of all time this movie has slowly gained a reputation as one of the best and most influential thrillers while providing us with an interesting window into Alfred Hitchcock's mind. Most of his work makes us uncomfortable about his feelings on women and self loathing but this film takes it even further as actions that he would later take in real life echo some of the actions of the protagonist in this film. Add in the fact that this film is beautiful to look at with eye popping visuals that rival other Technicolor productions from the 1950s that put most other films to shame. There was a pressure to watching this film again as I did not love it the first time I saw it and still struggle to penetrate it so I find myself admiring it more than loving it.\n\nDetective Scottie Ferguson, James Stewart, has a fear of heights and vertigo after he almost dies while chasing down a suspect and has his partner fall off the rooftop he is holding onto and die. He hangs out regularly with ex-fianc\u00e9e Midge Wood, Barbara Bel Geddes, but finds himself drawn to the enigmatic Madeleine Elster, Kim Novak, when he is asked to tail her by her husband Gavin, Tom Elmore. Gavin believes that she has blackouts in which she becomes her ancestor Carlotta Valdes who had a tragic life and commit suicide. Ferguson and Elster fall in love but she commits suicide and he is not blamed for her death. He looks for her in other women after her death and when he finds a woman who resembles her in Judy Barton, Kim Novak, he forces her to change her physical appearance to appeal to him. His controlling behavior ruins their relationship and a shocking revelation leads to a tragic end for Barton.\n\nObsession is a common theme in Hitchcock's films as he himself was obsessed with filmmaking and with his muses. The most famous case of him abusing a muse came with Tippi Hedren whom he tortured on the set of The Birds (1963) and Marnie (1964) and blamed for not being a Grace Kelly or an Ingrid Bergman. He fetishized those actresses and their beauty on screen but also wanted to see them hurt as a man like him, unattractive and overweight, could never attain them and by maiming or punishing them he was bringing them down to his level. In this film Ferguson has a similar fixation with the beautiful but mostly untouchable Elster who he falls in love with more because of her beauty and unattainability than any emotional connection he has with her. He then hates all other women because they cannot possibly be her and forces a woman who has been pretending to be the emotionally cold but beautiful wife into being Elster against her will before attacking her in anger. In her death he loses his fantasy woman who he can only watch from afar and destroy to allay his fears that he is not worthy of a woman like her but he will continue to look for another woman who can fill her role.\n\nHitchcock pulls off this crazy plot with typical style as there is a surreal dream sequence, a tension building Bernard Herrmann score and some stylish Edith Head costumes. Everybody working behind the camera is at the top of their game while making this film and every moment makes you gasp at the use of color in the film or the audacious shots that Hitchcock uses. This is in some ways a problem with the film as I was so outside of the story of the film while watching it and was never entirely immersed in it as I spent more time considering the various elements of the film rather than having them draw me into the cinematic experience. \n\nI found the use of \u2018nice guy' Stewart impressive as we take an actor that we associate with playing likable, morally pure figures in films like Mr. Smith Goes Washington (1939) and make him a terrifying creeper in the style of the director. His eyes which were so wide and angelic in The Philadelphia Story (1940) have a scary, manic quality here that makes him unpredictable and filled with a deep unsettlement. It was Novak who let the film down for me as she cannot act from the films I have seen her in and while we are meant to believe that she is alluring and seductive her performance is wooden. She never had the star quality that great female leads in Hitchcock films have and her inability to play ambiguity or guarded emotion makes Elster come across as flat. When she is asked to play Barton she seems more alive but when she shrieks and schemes she aims for camp more than devastation. \n\nNovak's weaknesses as an actress are not enough to let the film down completely but she prevents the film from being the masterpiece that it could have been in my mind.",

The man we follow in the story is Scotty, who is afraid of heights, something he will have to face up to later in the story of course. But this film is not predictable. When Scottie falls in love with a woman,(or the image of a woman) it's not what it seems.\n\n\"Did he train you? Did he rehearse you?

Going back was like time traveling, figuring out just how foundational a piece this was to my taste in film. My attraction to the works of David Lynch; my preference of slow, meandering, patient thrills; my fixation on the psychology of troubled, and perhaps damaged, men--all of it can be traced back to what I saw in Hitchcock's 1958 classic.\u2028\nBut it's also not hard to see why I gravitated towards this to begin with. I've always been obsessed with dreams and particularly how they inform how we perceive our surroundings, I visited San Francisco a couple of times before watching this for the first time and fell in love with the location, I always loved gimmicky hooks. Vertigo may just be the Hitchcock film which speaks to me on the most personal level, then and now.\nOutside of the deeply personal element in this viewing, I was taken aback by how many levels Vertigo works on. I think recent films such as Darren Aronofsky's mother! or Alex Garland's Annihilation can take notes from Hitchcock's 60-year-old example. This story functions perfectly fine on its surface as a tale of a man falling in love with the woman he's been tasked with following, but it also works as a meta-commentary on viewer manipulation, a personal expression of Hitchcock's troubled psyche, and as a meditation on the fragile nature of the human mind.\u2028\nIt's not perfect (the best ones never are), there are a couple scenes of nameless experts explaining medical or legal concepts to the audience which would make the psychiatrist scene from Psycho blush, a few studio shots don't blend well with the much better on-location shots, and the ending all happens very quickly. I have never read a single paper or analysis on Vertigo, so I apologize if I'm not bringing anything new to the table, but this is one I'm going to hold on to for the rest of my life.\u2028\n9/10",

Don't get me wrong: I love the film, I have it on DVD, and there is much to admire it, particularly the cinematography and production design, which are sumptuously gorgeous. And the film does shoot for a certain baroque grandeur in its involved and semi-gothic story of betrayal and love vs. possession. That said, it's overlong, scenes drag, the central con being played is laughably involved, and Stewart and Novak both seem miscast (although I've read that Hitch chose Novak because she was so blank that you could project whatever you want on her, as Stewart does, and it certainly works from that angle).\n\nAgain, I'm not knocking the film. If you're a fan of Hitchcock, Stewart, or breathtaking cinematic design elements, by all means see it. But the Greatest Film of All Time? Someone at S&S needs to explain that one to me. It wouldn't be first on my list even if we were confining ourselves to the films of Stewart -- I'd recommend \"Philadelphia Story,\" \"Harvey,\" and \"Anatomy of a Murder\" ahead of this. And if we're checking off Hitch's greatest films, I'm not sure this one makes my top ten. It certainly isn't going ahead of \"Lady Vanishes,\" \"39 Steps,\" \"Rebecca,\" \"Foreign Correspondent,\" \"Notorious,\" \"Rear Window,\" \"North By Northwest,\" or \"Psycho,\" and I'm not sure I'd put it ahead of \"The Birds.\"\n\nWonderful stuff. A lot to enjoy and chew on. Just not the greatest film ever made. I'll be curious to see what S&S has to say on their next list, due in 2022.",

The master of suspense director Alfred Hitchcock proves his title with this endlessly mysterious movie. You question everything thinking there must be some explanation for the events herein. Hitchcock leads you along the sweetest and the saddest romance film ever released. We are gifted with thoughtful depictions of themes like vertigo, fear, love, loss, grief, and reformation. Follow along with the most ponderous investigation ever undertaken.\n\nNotably, the cinematography and camera work from Hitchcock is marvelous. Every frame is fascinating and every panning shot is captivating. You see everything you need to in order to figure out the mystery and follow along with the plot. The intricate narrative is well written, but even more masterfully shot. At each scene, therein lies another beautiful sequence or deeper feeling conveyed by a revealing shot. Only a film like Persona can claim to have cinematography as nice as Vertigo.\n\nVertigo is a class act. You will remember the water, garden, bars, hotels, hallways, and rooms. The set decoration is as lovely as the stunning costume design. The main suit worn by Kim Novak is as iconic as any cinema look. With cinematography, score, set design, and costume design like Vertigo holds, you do not need any other movie. Vertigo is immaculately crafted by cast and crew alike.\n\nVertigo makes you figure out a mystery alongside its hero, while you are dazzled by the lovely score from master cinema composer Bernard Herrmann. The music is haunting and amorous throughout Vertigo. You will be swept off your feet by the tender melodies and drawn in by the disquiet swells. Herrmann wrote perhaps the greatest film music of all time. His sounds fill in the quiet spaces as a loving complement to the atmosphere.\n\nFinally, Vertigo contains the very best acting performance of legendary actor James Stewart. He portrays fear and love as thoughtfully. His facial expressions emote such depth and passion. He is sweet as a leading man, but also always compelling. Stewart is an every man that you truly relate to in Vertigo. Likewise, Kim Novak plays one of the most complex and alluring femme fatales in film. Novak's performance as a lead actress is so tender and seductive as much as she portrays sorrow and longing. Vertigo delivers dual leading roles that will enchant any viewer.\n\nIn all, Vertigo remains one of the most lovely romance films in the history of cinema. I love  it even after repeat viewings. Hitchcock perfected all of his mighty directorial skills and got splendid performances out of his stars. Vertigo is worth watching for its high entertainment value and impressive technical accomplishments. I would recommend Vertigo to all audiences as it is a surreal and sensual suspense story.",

Hitchcock's directing is supreme with a great use of camera-work, music and effects, putting it together wonderfully to create the maximum amount of intrigue, mystery and suspense. What a treat with an unpredictable conclusion that ties everything up neatly and leaves you reeling.",

Vertigo's bracing and ever-twisting plot, and its handling of moral paradox is powerful enough to provoke a vertigo-like sensation in the minds of its own audience! Hitchcock's use of images over words to capture universal emotions evidences his stature as one of the greatest visual stylists of all time. The film controls its audience. The subtle context in which raw, real emotion is presented allows the film's more subtle elements (music especially) to add haunting suspense. It may have a few minor plot-holes, but Vertigo embodies an open-minded, creative spirit of filmmaking that is seldom ever matched. This alone makes the film's power and purpose everlasting. Vertigo (1958) is truly amazing. It demands multiple re-watches and much deeper analysis and debate than I have attempted here.",

He gets a call from an old friend that begs him to investigate his wife's strange behavior, Stewart agrees, and to tell you anymore plot details would just rob you of experiencing this creepy, hypnotic masterpiece. \n\nThough originally critically panned, and a box office failure on release, Vertigo has since become known as one of the best films of all time, even beating out Citizen Kane in certain lists. It really is one of his most accomplished films, with a fantastic use of color, inventive camera tricks, like the now iconic \"Vertigo effect\" and great use of his two leads, particularly James Stewart. \n\nMy only minor complaints are firstly that the film does drag in its first thirty minutes, that would be a bigger problem if it didn't pay off so well by the end. However it is a bit annoying, and might make repeated viewings difficult. My second complaint comes from the ending itself, it happens so fast the viewer barely has any time to take it all in, or really think about what has just happened.\n\nVertigo is simply something that should not be missed. It's sadly easy to see why it didn't catch on well with audiences in 1958. The first half is largely long stretches that are entirely dialogue free, with Hitchcock using great locations and color to keep the viewer locked in. Combine that with it's twisty, odd, but ultimately wonderful story, and it's not hard at all to understand why it was just too obscure for an audience that was used to dialogue filled films, with little to no symbolism at the time, Vertigo was simply just too much for audiences back then, and it's a shame considering Hitchcock really poured his heart into this film, believing he had made one of his best. To echo what others have now said: it's a beautiful, haunting film that depicts love, obsession, and madness with great skill. Do yourself a favor and see what has rightfully been called an American classic.",

There is creepy sexual desire, and what self-abasing lengths a woman will go to do what 'does it' for a man.  Jimmy Stewart turns in a great performance, but as a nitpick, he's twice the age of Kim Novak (50 and 25), and also looks too old to have gone to college with his sidekick Barbara Bel Geddes (who's great by the way).  The film takes place in absolutely gorgeous scenery in San Francisco, Muir Woods and Mission San Juan Bautista, and it's at once both dream-like and nightmarish.  It feels like a quiet movie with its pace and small cast, but there is tension and mystery throughout.  There are several stunning moments, which I won't spoil, and the ending is absolutely brilliant.

It stars James Stewart as a former detective who suffers with a disease known as acrophobia which is a fear of heights which gives him vertigo. (hints the title) His college friend (played by Tom Helmore) is wanting him to privately investigate his wife as she is going through strange stages involving her ancestor. I'll start off by saying that this is Hitchcock's masterwork. He directs with an original style of filmography. He uses unique camerawork. Camerawork that is beyond breathtaking. Not only for the time. It still holds up very well. He also knows how to use different colors to express emotion, and to tell the story. James Stewart plays his character very well. In fact, everyone pulled off a very solid and believable performance. If you notice this in a movie, than it is a good sign. The VFX were nothing short of fitting as it matches perfectly with the protagonist's disease. Not to mention, this is one of the best thrillers ever made. (at least in my opinion) The first act gave us very useful information that you need to know for the rest of the movie, but at the same time, something was building up tension. I don't know what it was, but it was a bomb ready to go off. Once you see what it builds up to, the plot thickens to an extreme extent. So extreme that it becomes completely unpredictable and you don't know if it wants you to figure out what will occur in the future, or if it wants you to sit through the tension and see how it ends. All of it unfolds, and at the end, my head felt heavy with information. It is a film that made me want to see more with all of this information. It is a movie that requires a few viewings to lay out all of this info and come up with a conclusion of how it all unfolded. How did it do this so perfectly? Two words: Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nPlot: 9.5/10\nVisuals: 10/10\nActing: 8.5/10\nSound: 10/10\nEditing: 10/10\nCinematography: 10/10\nEntertainment value: 9.9/10\nOver all score: 10/10\n\nOver all, Vertigo was a brilliant thriller.

            "content": "Right now, I am working my way through Hitchcocks archive.  I have just watched Pyscho again, & just watched \"The Birds\" and loved both. Film's that will eventually get added to my collection. Today, I went back even further to 1958 and watched \"Vertigo\". Before watching the film, I had read that \"Vertigo\" had received very mixed review's when released in 1958 for being \"too slow\" and \"too long\" for just a \"physiological murder mystery\". However in the 1960s the film was re-evaluated and the rise of popularity for the movie started in 1968 when a British-canadian scholar called Robert Wood studied Hitchcocks work and called \"Vertigo\" a \"masterpiece\". After being re-released in cinema's in 1983 it was classed as \"one of the greatest American films of all time\". It's only just recently in 2012, that BFI's film magazine Sight & Sound moved it from 4th to 1st on their list of \"greatest films of all time\" . So what was my take on it? I am in the \"mixed\" crowd.\n\nIt hooked me in quite early for the directing by Hitchcock. You watch this extreme close up of a eye that slowly zooms out which looked amazing. \"Vertigo\" was also the first film to ever feature \"dolly zoom\" (a camera effect that distorts perspective to create disorientation). This effect was used to create Scotties acrophobia. As a result of it's use in the film, the effect is often referred to as the \"Vertigo effect\". Anyway, this style of directing was used multiple times and I believe  made the film appealing throughout. The \"nightmare\" scene being my favourite, the use of different colours was nice and you felt like you were in the characters mind. \n\nI must admit though, I didn't take to James Stewart's character as much as I was expecting to. Straight away he comes across as a very noble, kind gentleman and gradually becomes slightly creepy which I believe could of been the point but for me, it put me off. For plot reasons, he had to become creepy but it just didn't sell to me. \n\nI will try my hardest to not spoil it for you but the main plot behind the romance of the film wasn't built up enough for me to enjoy it. I had a lot of difficulty caring for the romance between the characters because I didn't feel the romance wasn't portrayed to the audience enough or in the right way. For a film that dragged for more than 2 hours, I felt let down. I felt I deserved more than what was portrayed. I longed for a real explanation and yet my mind was left wondering if it was actually something mystical that was driving the story.  \n\nThen you move into the third and final act of the film that gave you the big \"shock\" which fair play did actually shock me. I have always loved a good twist and when it is so simple and it still takes you by surprise, that's even better which \"Vertigo\" for me, did. \n\nWhy was it then I felt the film was just left to drag the plot out to an extent, it starts to bore you again? The movie just rambled on and on and I just couldn't get back on board. When I did jump back on board for the conclusion which was quite uncomfortable and made me a little bit anxious, suddenly the film ends very oddly. As I was watching on the train, my head was shouting \"Wait a minute, that's it\"? \n\nI didn't love Vertigo. However it had it's good elements that I loved. Visually I really enjoyed it. The score was quite intense. Kim Novaks acting was very well done but this just wasn't effective enough for me to enjoy it. I doubt I will ever revisit Vertigo but I can agree it was a very well made film.",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock was considered the master of suspense, with almost every movie he made. And for good reason. His films always kept the audience guessing, and wondering what was going to happen next. Plus, there was always a hint of tension with each production Hitchcock worked on, giving the audience something to be invested in. With 1958's \"Vertigo\", which could be argued as Hitchcock's masterpiece, is a prime example of what he brought forth to the big screen. There are a couple of issues surrounding the film, but the majority of the movie is definitely worth checking out. \"Vertigo\" may not be the master's greatest work, but it is one of his finest.\n\nThe story involves a San Francisco cop named John \"Scottie\" Ferguson (James Stewart), who has acrophobia, or a fear of heights resulting in vertigo. Hence the title. One day, an old friend asks John to spy on his wife, whose behavior has suddenly changed. The wife, Madeline (Kim Novak), is overseen by John, who wants to learn more about her, yet becomes slightly attractive to her in the process. What follows, John soon realizes that Madeline might be involved with something even bigger.\n\nFor many aspects the film has, \"Vertigo\" can be considered a high class mystery that lives up to the genre. For starters, the story is one of most invested narratives that audiences will thoroughly enjoy. It keeps the audience guessing as to what might happen next, until the big final reveal at the end of it all. Especially, considering that the film runs at almost two hours in length. In order to fill the void, we have a brilliant orchestrated score from Bernard Herrmann that more than enough sets the tone of the movie. Complemented with the brilliant direction of Hitchcock, who sets up the scenes with great detail, one has to wonder how he did it. Fortunately, this can be attributed to the brilliant set design, and cinematography representing a nice glimpse into the 1950s. Plus, the costumes fit well onto each actor and actress giving a nice nostalgic look to the film. Finally, both Stewart and Novak deliver some great performances, that truly make \"Vertigo\" a classic.\n\nWith that being said, there is one major and minor problem presented with the movie. The minor problem is that the story does get somewhat jumbled in the middle, and there are certain plot points which do not have a clear conclusion. More importantly, there's a subplot involving John and his girlfriend which starts off nicely in the beginning, but doesn't seem to go anywhere near the conclusion. The major problem is with the film's pacing; it's slow and drags like a rock moving across the road. However, the film does use this as an advantage to keep the progression of the story more in tact, but it just feels that if there had been some more fast sections, then it would have been fine.\n\nOverall, \"Vertigo\" is a great movie from Alfred Hitchcock, despite it not being his masterpiece, and yet, is still a classic nonetheless.",

It captivated me early because it has Hitchcock's amazing eye for shot selection and some superb music to keep things tense. Those things are what made Vertigo appealing throughout.\n\nI struggled with Jimmy Stewart's character in this film. I thought he was set up as a fairly noble guy and I liked him. However as the movie progresses he gradually becomes more and more creepy. It was bad enough when he's undressing and making out with another man's wife, but that final act with the clothes and hair obsession had me squirming in my seat.\n\nI also had difficulty with the romance in Vertigo. It's a problem I often have with movie love affairs, because I don't see enough build-up for these two people to claim they are in love. I was still trying to get over this guy kissing a friend's wife and the next thing I know he's confessing his love for her? It was tough for me to accept.\n\nThe softening of the romantic blow came through the plot. That's where Vertigo really shines. I was delighted by the mystery because I so desperately wanted to discover what was going on. I longed for a real explanation and yet I kept wondering if it was actually something mystical that was driving the story. \n\nThe first reveal of the truth was a true shocking moment for me and suddenly I was totally amazed how they fooled me. The fact that they had to insert a scene explaining it all in words right after the visual explanation felt a bit forced, but maybe they're just trying to cater to the people who can't put the pieces together on their own.\n\nThe third act was probably the weakest part of Vertigo. It felt like the movie was rambling after the reveal and dragging things out so long when I was just waiting for it all to finally hit the fan. Then the final moments were intense and uncomfortable. I was back on board and anxiously awaiting the dramatic conclusion. When it came it was so sudden, and odd that I wasn't ready for it and almost said \"Wait, that's it?\"\n\nI didn't love Vertigo. There are other Hitchcock films that are much more effective for me. However, there were elements of genius that I connected with in this film. The mystery gripped me, the visuals were stunning, the score was intense, and the acting was great. I doubt I'll revisit Vertigo, unlike my preferred Hitchcock movies, but I can recognize it's a very well-made film.",

A troubling picture in many ways, from its complex, effectively unsettling filmmaking to the distressing changes undertaken by Ferguson in the third act. Hitchcock is, of course, a master of the craft and there's much to be learned from his efforts behind the camera (the now-infamous dolly zoom, tricks with lighting and foreshadowing, a casual pace that somehow never seems to grow stale) but also plenty to wonder about the man himself from the actions of his on-screen counterpart. In a Hitchcock film, it's nothing new for a visibly older gentleman to effortlessly draw the affections of a young blonde. Stewart's no exception in this film, pulling buxom Kim Novak (twenty-five years his junior), but his particular brand of obsession quickly grows dark and insistent, leading to some very squeamish scenes as he draws close to unraveling the conspiracy that's ensnared them both. Of course, Ferguson ultimately pays a price for this turn, but his greater judgment is never laid out on the screen. Rather, it's abruptly left to the scrutiny of the viewing audience, with more than a nudge to suggest he may not be completely without alibi. Expertly concocted and tragic from a bird's-eye perspective, but worrying from a more introspective one.",

The acting especially from James Stewart is good and he is trying but overall this is just an above average movie. The camera work is good. \n\nDuring the first 30 minutes or so the movie just drags, and the pacing is so slow. It shows what we already know. Scottie has vertigo and is asked to follow his friend's wife who thinks she is a reincarnation or something. It is almost like nothing is happening and Scottie is just doing his job. It was during this time I asked myself that why was I watching this.\n\nThe character development is very poor excluding Scottie. His ex girlfriend had no role in this movie. She is just there. Nothing is told as to whh they broke up. We dont need a full background story but a simple explanation whould have done it. Many parts of the movie could have been edited. \n\nThen we come near the 3rd act of the movie. 5 minutes into it the suspense is revealed like wtf. It didn't work for me. Again the pacing is somewhat slow until the end. The ending is very abrupt and it is just thrown at us. In some cases it works only if the overall movie is excellent and makes sense. I will be honest I wasn't expecting the ending but it doesn't work for me. Somethings are not even well explained. \n\nI can't go into more details because it will give out spoilers. So overall you may or may not like this movie. But if your having a boring day, go for it.",

Perhaps it was the hype surrounding a movie considered one of the best of all time, but upon watching the final few minutes with horror and confusion, I was left ultimately dissatisfied. I understand the thematic values of the film and the introduction of the dolly zoom, as well as James Stewart's turn to the dark side, but it was a very odd movie. \n\nThe first half is a slow affair of watching a former detective do his former job quite horribly. I guess in retrospect it's good to know he was being played a fool the entire time or else I'd still wonder if the person he was tailing had no awareness that the same car and man was twenty feet behind her the entire time barely making any attempt to conceal his actions, especially at the cemetery. Following him romancing another man's wife, which again absolves her of worse judgement for she isn't actually wed, it just goes off the rails and becomes a dark look at obsession.\n\nTake away the twist \"revelation,\" which was explained right away leaving no mystery to follow, and it remains just as horrifying watching this man obsess over a dead loved one and change a stranger, make her dress like her, and take her to where she died. He knew because of a necklace. What if that wasn't truly the case? This man acts like a monster. Remove the letter and confession and he still remains a monster; the only difference is that he's no longer right. How far would it have gone if it was a different girl he tried to change for himself? Would it still have come to the bell tower down the road if there was no necklace? He went down a deep dark path, and the movie abruptly ends with a terrible fate.\n\nThe fact that I'm thinking so much about the movie gives it some points, but there's quite a bit of this movie that just moves so slowly.",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock wowed audiences for decades with an immense talent of deception and artistic flare, and perhaps no movie was a better showcase for those talents than his 1958 hit Vertigo.  An impressive tale about obsession.\n\nIn honor of Alfred Hitchcock's birthday, I decided to re-watch Vertigo and reevaluate just how well it holds up upon repeated viewings.  There's nothing quite like the shock of watching it for the first time, but I had a chance to dig my teeth into the legendary performances of James Stewart and Kim Novak while being dazzled by Hitchcock's meticulously crafted story.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects about Vertigo is that it's clearly framed as a story about someone with Vertigo dealing with a peculiar case, but really, it's about obsession, and a man digging just a little bit too deep into a case.  A theme that Christopher Nolan seemed to take into his film, Memento, in 2000.  Vastly different stories, but similar execution from the director's chair.\n\nAn easy way to identify a film's tone is through the score, and Hitchcock always seemed to get the best out of the legend, Bernard Herrmann.  His score here is both haunting and alluring.  I love the way he balanced the score with the uncomfortable feeling we get as an audience watching Stewart's character obsess, along with the noir-ish love story that forms as well.\n\nAmidst Hitchcock's mind boggling story are a few darn good performances by Stewart and Novak.  Stewart, typically known strictly in likable protagonist roles, finds himself in a more complex and even unlikable alley.  There's certainly times where the lines between protagonist and antagonist are blurred, but Stewart does a great job at rounding out his character.  Novak, on the otherhand, plays a more mysterious role but nonetheless just as significant.  Aside from the characters in Psycho, Novak may have had the most difficult time portraying just who Hitchcock desired for this role.  If there was ever a Hitchcock blonde who deserved a Best Actress Oscar, I think it was Novak.\n\nOverall, Vertigo holds up just as well as the first time I watched it, and perhaps even better in some aspects.  There's a reason this film is at the top of so many greatest films of all time lists.\n\n+Hitchcock's colorful direction\n\n+Stewart and Novak were at the top of their game\n\n+Herrmann's score\n\n+Themes still hold up\n\n10/10",

Hitchcock undoubtedly did a great job in giving Vertigo a surreal feel through its cinematography.  Some research may help me appreciate it more, but as of right now, Vertigo is a beautifully shot, well acted, at times charming and hypnotic noir thriller that somewhat left me feeling indifferent for two thirds of its run-time.",

The first act was pretty much a whole lot of driving and a spoiled rich woman (Kim Novak) looking for attention by taking every opportunity to attempt suicide when Jimmy Stewart wasn't looking, like a lemming in Chanel. \n\nMeanwhile, well-intentioned Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) waits in the wings, withering as a bra engineer waiting for Jimmy to notice she's still in love with him. Granted, recreating a painting of Jimmy's new love's doppelganger great grandmother and replacing the head with her own may not have been the best \"Hey I'm Still In Love With You\" gag gift, but still, do you want Dimentia Daisy (Kim Novak) or Marriageable Midge? I'm gonna bank on whoever has eyebrows that COULDN'T be charged with perjury simply by fault of existence.\n\nThen it devolves into some creepy Elizabeth Smart, Stockholm Syndrome dollhouse fantasy full of late 50s fashions and a surplus of hair ringlets and Jimmy doing a greatest hits of surprised faces. *SPOILERS* (god, that's almost funny) Really Jimmy? The necklace gave it away? Not the fact that this Ringlet Ronda (Kim Novak) drew on those same goddamned evil eyebrows? \n\nI plan on writing a strange self-referential retool of this premise where Kim Novak's character actually follows Jimmy Stewart around and then throws herself into water forcing Jimmy (this time with a fear of water) to save her.  All the while she's planning to steal and/or kill Jimmy to get revenge on Midge who's careless ways accidentally cost the life of the only man Kim ever loved when she was younger and she and Midge knew each other. Only Midge puts the pieces together and confronts Kim, killing her. But of course not before she says, \"I don't know who's a worse liar, you, or your eyebrows.\" But the plot thickens as we discover this has all been tangled up in the real Kim's husband's plan to kill the real Kim and that the Kim she killed was actually the decoy. Eventually all Kims die and Jimmy ends up with Midge.",

Its camera angles are fresh.  Although countless other movies and television shows have been set in San Francisco, Vertigo gives us new scenes (e.g. the garden of Mission Dolores, exterior and interior of Palace of the Legion of Honor fine arts museum, the huge Brocklebank Apartments building, the old house known as \"McKittrick's Hotel\", Fort Point beneath Golden Gate Bridge, etc. etc. etc.). San Francisco feels fresh again.\n\nExcellent character development...maybe the best I've ever seen in a film.\n\nOn the negative side:\n\n1. John Ferguson's infidelity--how distasteful.  Combined with the words \"Mother's here\" from his longtime girlfriend, Midge, and Ferguson's obsession with Judy, this movie's love theme comes off as a creepy, perverted love.\n\n2. Ferguson's dream sequence is so amateurishly done--it's almost laughable.\n\n3. The second half of the film is tedious, lacking visual freshness.\n\n4. Many critics refer to Hitchcock as the master of suspense, but in this film, he fails to deliver.  It contains only a few conundrums with minimal emotional intensity.\n\n5.  Judy's ending is contrived, inexplicable.",

There are no happy accidents on a Hitchcock picture, because every frame is so carefully conceived and determined.\n\nWhat makes \"Vertigo\" a masterpiece isn't just Bernard Hermann's complex score or Jimmy Stewart's authentic performance or even the mystery of Kim Novak's character, but rather the act of unfolding the story and the changing perspectives.\n\nCinema is a type of language with many different dialects. There are films that speak with spirituality and profundity. Films that speak with naturalism and authenticity. Other films speak romantically with great melodrama and theatricality. Alfred Hitchcock simultaneously speaks all three at once in his films. There's a strong subtext that lives in a realistic world, but at the same time it's clear that we're in the hands of a master of romanticism.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things there are three filmmakers that cemented themselves in cinema as the most important names in narrative cinema history: John Ford (The Searchers, The Grapes of Wrath), C.B. DeMille (The Ten Commandments, The Greatest Show on Earth), and, of course, Alfred Hitchcock. Directors everywhere owe a great deal to the films of Alfred Hitchcock, and \"Vertigo\" is no exception.

I liked the visuals more than many other titles from the same era and/or auteur. I noticed a lot of things that I'm sure historians have cited as influential. For example, one thing I haven't heard much commentary on - how it's scored. It's scored so much like movies of today, and not like others of its time. There were a lot of other things that I knew existed at the time, but were not common, such as the visions, repeated elements of the story, and moving the biggest event to the midpoint. However, there were also some flaws for me. I figured out the mystery before the protagonist did, which is not that big a deal in this case. But there were some points that stretched believability in the second half (basically how he treats his woman), and in the first half there's really long scenes of blatant exposition. In fact, I think Stewart's character calls attention to it with a line of dialogue, so Hitchcock seems to have acknowledged that flaw.",

            "content": "Rating-8/10\n\nWith Alfred Hitchcock you get two things guaranteed, mystery and thrills, and a lot of them. Vertigo is no exception here and Hitchcock creates a movie full of suspense and a kind of eerie feel to it, with a plot that flows very nicely until the very end. Slow in parts and maybe not recommended for all, this is still acted very well and the technical aspects are spot on. Is it a masterpiece?, well I will say here why I don't think it is but though, why it is still a great film to view.\n\nThe story is all about an ex detective, who finds out he has extreme fear of heights and has to track and old friends wife, unique right and done well too, brilliantly put out there onto the big screen. James Stewart stars and does very well, his calm composure and firm personality make him likeable but at times very strange and importantly, mysterious. Kim Novak is also fine in this and her portrayal is also mysterious and she is really the kind of eerie but interesting plot point in this movie.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock directs this in a way which is very well done, a kind of slow feel that gradually builds up to the finer moments of the film and makes this movie what it is. It is written well, I didn't think it was fantastic but it is pretty good, it is of course actually an adaptation of \"The Living and the Dead\" and the writers(Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor) make this very interesting and done well too of course.\n\nNow is it the greatest movie of all time?, well for me no but I do highly rate it, just not as high as some others. The reason I can't claim this is the best is because it just isn't enjoyable enough, sure it is engaging but the plot gets kind of thin by the end. I think also it very slow, I mean it can have it's fast moments but some moments are just too slow moving, for me the last half starts to slightly drag but it holds itself together to finish off in it's own unique style.\n\nI think a reason many do like it so much, is the depth which I won't deny is there and makes this one heck of an interesting flick. It's the level of acting also coupled with that in depth storyline that make this great, not perfect but pretty excellent. I think Hitchcock knows what is best for this and goes straight for it, he seems to mix the elements finely and it feels as if he put a lot of personal style into this, making it more realistic and less like typical Hollywood made movies. \n\nI think the visuals and the camera work make this stand out even more in the history of film, and definitely in the era in which it was made. With finely used camera techniques this becomes a different level for the day, Robert Burks makes this just perfect homework for any budding cinematographer and how to manipulate the cameras view. The score is also a fine one, not great but well done, makes the suspense much more thrilling and the story just a little more engaging. \n\nSo all in all this for me isn't the very best, but doesn't surprise me why some love it so much, just in this day is it really as important as before?, I'll leave that for anyone out there who wants to answer that. In any case this is a very good movie though and I would recommend it to anyone, and especially to those who call themselves film fans.",

            "content": "Poor Jimmy, he was always putting himself in dangerous situations and Hitchcock was only adding to it and with 'Vertigo', they mostly succeeded. This film has the great build up and intrigue that Hitchcock could, at is point, probably do in his sleep. It has a solid concept and it builds up in an excellent way and had me on the edge of my seat, it deftly weaved the mystery and romance and made it work so smoothly and there's a shot at around 1 hour of the main characters kissing that would have been an excellent ending shot for a film. The acting is great from everyone involved with Stewart demonstrating his unique way of handling dialogue once more and I actually thought that they made Stewart look younger here than he was in 'Rear Window', I didn't even think about the huge age difference the leads share until I read about it afterwards, and even so, Kim Novak looked the part perfectly. Stewart plays his character confidently and he was unrelenting and brave, but he had to have been because of his previous job but still, nobody knows what he could have easily put himself into and I honestly don't understand all the complaints I've read about his acting in this film, either. It's also really hard to see what happens to his character as the film progresses and Stewart handles it all perfectly. And, hey, his character pretty much starts out in a room with physical pain, some things never change! Everything else is as great as we expect it to be, the pacing, the script- that had lots of great character moments, Scottie asked his friend to hurry up and she did and he was surprised about it and another scene where because of the fact that the character had left quickly beforehand in another scene, I thought when Scottie went to shut the door before they went out, that character in their car would have left. All the way down to the use of the creepy sound effects once more and, hell, the filmmakers even make trees look eerie. \n\nIt was all looking great but something happens with about 45 minutes left to go of the film and I said to myself that I had no idea what they could do next and I was pretty much right because the film completely changes and it just isn't as good. It isn't because of the slower pace that I didn't like it as much; it's just that it fails at making actual sense. We, as the audience, know why Judy is putting up with Scottie's increasingly erratic behaviour but he doesn't and he ceases to be likeable because of it. Nobody would put up with his behaviour at all, like I've said before, characters don't need to be likeable or relatable for a film to work, while it is still very hard to watch what happens to his character as the film progresses, like I said, but in this film its totally different. Strangers were indeed less sceptical with one another back then but that's just ridiculous. They are out shopping for clothes and the shop assistant says, 'Yes, sir, we know what you want', I mean really, 'YOU' want, but what about what the lady wants? The fact that he couldn't put two and two together as a former detective, especially when Judy has her makeover, is something I find to be unbelievable; perhaps he was holding himself back, which I think he did at one point because it looked like he knew what was going on from looking at her silhouette, because it'd hurt too much to think about it any other way? Much like I was doing myself. What might have been unpredictable back in the day isn't really all that shocking when I watched this, but it started long before what I've mentioned. The plot twist isn't really anything special and resulted in me going, 'oh, is that it?' Throughout the film I was holding myself back from thinking about it too much because I know I would have ended up thinking what it was. Even at the start when Scottie is trying to stand on the tall chair, I knew something was going to happen when he got to the top, which maybe perhaps too critical but even so. The first scene in the art gallery where the two characters have the same hair, the camera very obviously zooms in on both the hair to show us that they're the same and while that might have been trying to symbolise Scottie's eyes, it still felt like obvious filmmaking. And what was up with the cinematography in this film? There's a scene in a book shop and I could have sworn the screen was getting darker by the second, I thought there was a point to it, like the scene was fading out slowly or that the shop didn't have lights in it but it just stops when they go outside the shop and everything is blindly bright, and we are shown that the shop did indeed have lights. Also, the scene in the graveyard looks oddly blurry for some reason, however, it still does look pretty good and has some neat little tricks in there, like, they talk about a tower and it's in frame, which happens a few times, actually, and other things like that and the open titles sequence is visually appealing, as well as the creative dream sequence.\n\nI thought this film was going to dabble in the supernatural at one point and while that would have been unexpected, I was excited for it. I thought the kiss in the shot at 1hr would have been revealed as what transmitted whatever was going on or the twist was that she didn't exist and while that would have been over the top fantasy for some, I think it'd have been better than the overly convoluted entity that the story ends up becoming. Honestly, the problems with the story don't even start there, within the first minute we see policemen jumping over rooftops and that already raised red flags for me, would they honestly risk their lives that much to catch someone? When they first jumped I thought there would at least be the top of the building to fall back on if they missed the roof but, no, there was nothing, which is a crazy thing to do because one mistake with a jump like that and you don't get to try again, as we plainly see, however, it is good how it leaves his rescue in mystery, which I liked and it's good. But I guess it exists to introduce us to the painfully contrived ailment that Scottie suffers from; vertigo. Was it really necessary to name the whole film over one, almost unimportant, aspect of Scottie's life? I know it does have some relevance in the plot, is key to the plot twist and represents its overall theme but none of it felt natural at all and could have very easily have been written to be something else. It isn't like the film forgets he has it, like so many do, it's just that it is hardly used to feel like it was anything other than what it was, an overly convoluted story that exploits his exact illness. I knew something wasn't right in the top of that tower as everything seemed to happen very quickly up there and I think people would have been able to work out that the body wasn't alive when it fell either- keeping vague to not spoil it. All I will say is, it seems like an overly complicated way to do what the person behind it all wanted to happen, whilst framing his friend in the process, sure, it works for the story and it makes sense, but still. \n\nThe way some of the characters act doesn't make sense either. We're supposed to believe that Scottie is a detective, and yet, he stands so close sometimes that if the character he is following were to just turn their head, he'd be screwed and I'm talking about the graveyard scene in particular. He just looks like a shy little boy wanting to ask his crush out from the way he was standing. He wasn't exactly hiding the fact that he was following them either, he didn't have two cars distance or whatever it's supposed to be and was extremely close, but it was also their fault for not working out that they were being followed either, but then again, that works its way into the story but it still doesn't make sense from a logic standpoint but cars also looked very alike as well, so maybe that isn't a reason they noticed they were being followed. The doctor, in the very brief hospital scene, is surprised to hear that Scottie was infatuated with a certain character, really? You didn't know that very important little detail about one of your patients in your care, really? Also, the scene at the hospital was almost pointless, his depression is totally undeveloped and it comes and goes so quickly that I was honestly confused to see his character walking around normally again so soon, he seemingly left so quickly that I thought for a moment the scenes after the hospital were an hallucination or something. Just even a little bit of time should have been given to this plot point as it would have evened out the last 45 minutes, it's not like it would have killed the pace either, Hitchcock knows what he is doing, but I've read some theories that everything after that point WAS a hallucination, and so on. Why didn't Scottie show his badge more often? He had no problem using it in the hotel previously but later on whenever he asks people for help, they seem startled and he doesn't take the time to show them? I'd suspect someone coming up to me asking very direct questions also, but he could have used his badge and it would have made his world so much easier. I think this is something we can all relate to though, but still, why do we look at what is going to affect us? He looks down from a high distance willingly and he probably shouldn't have, however, it gives us one of cinemas most iconic moments, so there is that. A character that Scottie saves takes quite a while, when they finally wake up, to ask what's going on and where they are, wouldn't that be the first thing you'd ask if you were in a strange place? Although, if you had no memory of how you ended up where you were, I guess you would be a little stunned, and again, people were less sceptical of strangers but perhaps I'm being too critical now, but that wouldn't have happened if I was as immersed as I wish I would have been. \n\nI feel sorry for Midge because she really didn't have anything to do in the film, she helps Scottie out and then gets rejected and that's it. I thought Scottie would have made a joke about her picture by going, 'oh no, oh no... It's great!' but it's much different. I understand the themes, symbolism and hidden meanings with what is going on both for the film and what Hitchcock wanted to portray but it still needs to make sense in the confines of a story and still exist in the realm of logic, something that this film forgets to do, like I've mentioned earlier. Should this film really be forgiven because of what it represents? However, the film still makes sense when you know what the twist is, which is always a good thing. Finally, though, at the end Scottie finally uses some of his intuition that he should have used earlier to find out that everything isn't as it seems even if the jewellery plot point felt coincidental. The ending of this film nearly saved it but they even manage to mess that up, the final... Jump, shall we say as to not spoil it, felt rushed and only seemed to exist because of a creepy nun that could have easily just called out. Oh, but wait, there's supposed to be symbolism in that final jump, isn't there? But again, it needs to make sense. Perhaps if it wasn't so realistic then maybe I could go alone with it? I don't know...\n\nIt must sound like I absolute hate this film but I don't, I just don't feel the need to say the positives that everyone else has already said and decided to focus on specifically what I had problems with. I wasn't bored with this film, surprising as that must sound, I was solidly engaged in what was going on, it was just odd the way the story progressed; it felt uneven and the second half weighed down the excellent first half. How anyone can say the first half drags is unbelievable, but hey, it must be unbelievable to someone that I have any negatives at all, so, we all have our opinions, of course. This film had an outstanding concept and for a while was outstanding itself but it quickly changes to being something different, it certainly wasn't the film I expected. The great film cover makes it look like it will be a murder mystery but soon it develops into something much more personal, but I didn't go in with expectations either, like anything, I went in with no expectations and ready to enjoy the film for what it is. I knew I had issues with the film but still thought it'd be 4 stars but with writing this, it really has dampened that fact. I gave it a 3.5 because that seems right and that indicates via this website that I liked it, because I did like it and I cared about what happened to these characters, but I've explained what I didn't like as well. Perhaps I'll watch this again one day when I'm much older and it'll all fall into place, but for right now, this is what I think.",

Composer Bernard Herrmann's score is riveting & intriguing. With a strong script, acting talents, score, cinematography & editing this is a film that doesn't fail to entertain. The original novel however has been commented as written for Hitchcock as the elements of suspense & mystery feature. The Authors have denied this, it could also be written in a specific way after Hitchcock's interest in their previous novel, in which he sadly missed out on the film rights.

So, it's as close to watching these movies for the first time that one can really get.  I decided to start with Vertigo, which was one of my favorite Hitchcock movies growing up.\n\nWhile this is indubitably a very good movie, upon a re-watch, it is a bit overrated.  When watching older movies, I really try to put myself back in that time frame - so you will rarely see me bitch about \"special effects not being up to par\" or stuff like that.  The plot is beautifully crafted with excellent twists and groundbreaking camera work.  Nowadays, we are always looking for \"the twist\", so fooling the audience is much more difficult.  But, with Hitchcock, it was an art form more than it was just a standard movie device.  And, there was nobody better at it.  James Stewart was magnificent as usual, and the final 90 minutes clipped along pretty well.  The ending was great and really struck home the point of, \"the more obsessed you get the more likely you will lose the object of your obsession\".\n\nNow, that being said, there were 2 main issues I had with this movie.  1) The first 40 minutes of this movie was slllooowwwww.  Now, I'm not someone who needs constant action - far from it.  I love the build up in The Exorcist as well as the first LOTR movie.  But there was stuff going on in those movies.  This was literally driving and following for 40 minutes - easily could have been cropped in half to make the movie more concise.  2) While I love James Stewart, he was just a little bit too old for this particular role.  Kim Novak appeared to be about half his age, and it made their love story just a tiny bit awkward for me.  When she wakes up in his bed naked, it just felt a little creepy.  \n\nThese were legitimate issues for me that drop the movie from \"all time great\" discussion.  It is a very good movie and I would highly recommend re-watching if it's been a while.  However, I would suggest tempering your expectations going in.\n\nGrade = 8.0/10",

I really thought I was going to figure it out before the end n I couldn't. It kind reminded me of the movie Rebecca, which is another great one by him. This isn't my favorite Hitchcock though and I'll tell you why. I didn't buy Stewart having this affair with this woman-number one he was way too old for her and number two she was married to his friend n there seems such little regard for that! Therefore I couldn't really get into the love story, except at the very end with his obsession with the ghost of his ex.",

            "content": "\"Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.\"\n\nHitchcock's Vertigo is considered by many critics as the best film ever, although this wasn't always the case considering that when it was released in 1958 it was poorly received by audiences and critics alike. So much so that it marked the last time that Hitchcock worked with James Stewart who he blamed for not attracting audiences any more due to his age. Unfortunately it was the last collaboration between the two, but they left us a rich legacy. Hitchcock also blamed Kim Novak's performance, but if he were alive today he would realize what a mistake those two claims were. First of all, I believe Kim Novak was enchanting in this film, she was the perfect femme fatale in this sort of film noir suspense thriller. She was attractive and hard to decipher. James Stweart was also great and once again is believable as this obssesed man who is following this mysterious women all over San Francisco. His fear of heights, which is a key part of this film, is also believable and thanks to Hitchcok's technique (now known as the Vertigo shot) those scenes worked extremely well. However, the best thing about Vertigo is the strange twists it takes and how it surprises us with the direction it takes half way through the film. It is hard to clasify this film and it goes places you never imagine. This is what Hitchcock does best in his films and that is why he is considered as the Master of Suspense. The psychological elements are always present and everything is so masterfully crafted in this film that it is hard to break out of the enchanted atmosphere created here. \n\nThe film's theme of obsession is probably why it is called a masterpiece considering no other film has explored this subject as well as Vertigo does. I personally prefer Rear Window, another collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock, as his masterpiece although that film is more generic and easier to classify. In Rear Window Hitchcock explores voyeurism, in Vertigo a man's obsession over a mysterious woman who he feels attracted to. Actually there are two women who Stewart's character relates to in this film. Other than Madeleine (Kim Novak) who is the woman he is assigned to follow around the city he also shares a close friendship with Midge (played by Barbara Bel Geddes) his former love interest from his college days. Midge is an intelligent women and the perfect one for Scottie (James Stewart), but as he becomes more and more obssesed with Madeleine she begins to be sidelined. The only issue I had with this film involved some of the dialogue scenes between Scottie and Midge during the beggining of the film which served to set up the story and their background. It never felt authentic but it accomplished its purpose. Once Kim Novak enters in the picture and the theme of obsession kicks in the film really picks up and seduces the audience into its mysterious and eerie atmosphere. It's unpredictable, but I wouldn't say this thriller is as scary as Psycho, another Hitchcock film I would rank above Vertigo. I really loved this film despite some pacing issues during the beggining and midway through the stor, but other than that I agree with the claims that this is a masterpiece and a must see for film lovers everywhere. Just like Citizen Kane this is a film that was ahead of its time and one who the contemporary audience wasn't ready to embrace.",

            "content": "The 50's to the 60's was arguably Hitchcock's most daring period. Hinting at suppressed homosexuality (\"Strangers on a Train\"), finding the darkly comic situation of the inability to keep a corpse buried (\"The Trouble with Harry\") and focusing on humans voyeuristic instincts (\"Rear Window\" and \"Psycho\"), it seems Hitchcock was fascinated by making audience identify with their repressed desires. And while these previous mentioned films were all Hitchcock classics, \"Vertigo\" still remains the autuers most mysterious and possibly, most complex.\r\n\r\nThe narrative primarily focuses on detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart) who comes out of retirement to help investigate the mysterious activities surrounding an old friends wife. While this may sound conventional thriller territory, there is a sense of mystery (and elements that borderline the supernatural) that add a great sense of intrigue to the narrative. Furthermore, Hitchcock's direction perfectly contributes to films mysterious nature. In a much celebrated passage (evoking the directors notion of 'Pure Cinema'), Hitchcock substitutes dialogue and lets the narrative unfold through visual imagery and Bernard Herrmann's score. However, most importantly during this sequence, Hitchcock situates us in Scottie's voyeuristic position so just like the detective himself, the audience also become obsessed and intrigued with the enigmatic Madeline Elster (Kim Novak). And while this sequence is often the most referenced, throughout \"Vertigo\" there are continues reminders of Hitchcock's virtuoso capabilities with a camera: from the beautiful imagery of San Francisco, perfect frame compositions, hyper-stylized visuals and of course the birth of the 'Vertigo Shot.'\r\n\r\nIn relation to character dynamics, \"Vertigo\" would have be Hitchcock's most - in terms of emotion - significant. In many of his films, Hitchcock usually has characters that represent idealized constructions of gender that usually have a charming and playful chemistry. Although we see this Hitchcock archetype initially (the relationship between Scottie and Midge [Barbara Bell Geddes]), the dynamic that eventually follows is the directors most melancholic and tragic. To watch Scottie, after losing his idealized vision of love (a women who does not exist) attempting to recreate elements of the past demands all sympathy from the audience. More importantly, while Scottie is the essential victim, Hitchcock makes Scottie's conflict so much more interesting by blurring the distinctions between perpetrator (Judy) and victim (Scottie) which in turn allows the audience to not only feel sympathy for Scottie, but also for Judy's internal torment. By the time we reach the final conclusion, the audience is torn between sympathizing for both fragmented figures.\r\n\r\nAlthough \"Vertigo\" undeniably represents Hitchcock as a director at the top of his game and some of his most powerful character dynamics, it really is the subject matter that makes the narrative such a complex tale. Released directly before the 'New Hollywood' period, it is astonishing how much the film, thematically, focuses on morbid notions. As suggested with the characterization of Madeline, there are times where her character reflects the inevitability of death. Considering that the film was made during the late 50s, in a time of paranoia and the possibility of nuclear extinction, it is quite obvious to see how the subject matter is audacious (and possibly why it failed at the box-office). If these concepts were not disturbing enough, the second half of the tale and the depiction of Scottie's obsession and idealism and attempts to recreate past desires through Judy Barton (Kim Novak) with a complete disregard to her internal conflicts is simultaneously tragic and disturbing (James Stewart's acting abilities in conveying this fine line is truly amazing). And beyond all this, Hitchcock continually manipulates the visuals, implores certain lighting techniques and interesting interchanges between omnipresent and POV positions that all contribute to the dream-like quality of the film (to the point where Scottie's 'reality' is put into question). Considering all these notions (and there are many I have not mentioned such as identity politics, masculine romanticism, the impotency of masculine stereotypes and the interchange between the past and the present), \"Vertigo\" could quite possibly be Hitchcock's most richest film.\r\n\r\nMany say that Hitchcock, when making movies, always considered the audiences expectations. For his other films, this is undeniably true. However, as many have noted (even the director himself), \"Vertigo\" is the autuers most personal effort. And while initially critics critiqued Hitchcock for being self-indulgent, this indulgence created the layers upon layers within film that add to its everlasting intrigue and like Scottie himself, after repeating viewings it is hard to not become obsessed with \"Vertigo\" mysterious nature.",

To get them out of the way, here are the cons of this picture: The film unwraps its suspense slowly, which has its good points and bad points, but generally causes the film to goo up and stick at certain moments, most notably the large portion of the film dedicated to watching Jimmy Stewart stalk Kim Novak from his Ford (probably sponsored).  Also, it edges a bit on the supernatural, a place many cinematic thrill-seekers would have loved to see Hitch venture, but feels a bit uncomfortable to a fan of his \"realistic-situation\" form of suspense that allows us to sympathize just a little more with the protagonists, which brings me to my major props to the underrated Barbara Bel Geddes, the \"always-the-bridesmaid\" of the story, who gives us that outlet for sympathy that greatly lacks in this film, which is surprising considering that Jimmy Stewart is perhaps one of the most sympathetic actors in history.  Not in this movie.  Another sticking point is the lack of humor, the iconic tool Hitch would normally employ to take the edge off his characters to make them more emotionally maneuverable. But to be fair, this film is crafted beautifully from an artistic standpoint, with stunning cinematography and a landmark score by Herrmann.  So depending on your criteria, this film could easily be seen either as an uncomfortable cadence in Hitch's masterpiece-lineup or as an artistic gold-mine.  Either way, it still sits proudly in my collection and is worth watching every once in a while just to see the little points you may not have noticed the last time.  Give Vertigo a chance, but don't go into it expecting it to be the best or the worst, because opinions can and will vary regarding this interesting film that Hitch considered his best.",

I've seen and enjoyed his British movies from the 30's, like The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes. I was right there when Hitch transferred to America with his 1940 film, Rebecca (a classic, I might add). And I watched as he found is stride in the 50's with hits like Rear Window and Dial M for Murder. Up until this point, I have pretty much lapped up everything I have seen from this iconic director. \r\n\r\nAnd that is why I find no shame in hating Vertigo. Now, I'm no expert - far from it. But I've seen over twenty Hitchcock movies in my life, and none have been as bad as this. I definitely went in with high expectations. Not only do I have a great track-record with The Master of Suspense, but Vertigo is also considered one of his bests - and one of the best movies ever made ... And to that I ask, \"What the heck did I miss?\" I cannot fathom anyone who has seen Hitch's actual greats, like North by Northwest, Shadow of a Doubt, and Strangers on a Train, preferring this. I cannot fathom anyone ranking Vertigo ahead of actual \"best movies ever\" like Casablanca, 12 Angry Men, and It's a Wonderful Life. \r\n\r\nI guess it's all a matter of taste. Ranking something as \"the best\" or \"the worst\" is extremely subjective. But I just cannot accept the fact that so many people think this is an essential classic. \r\n\r\nSo real quick, the story centers on Scottie Ferguson. He is an ex-police detective who takes a new job from Gavin Elster, an old friend. The job requires that Scottie follow Gavin's wife Madeleine, who appears to be possessed. But along the way, Scottie falls in love with Madeleine, further complicating the already complicated tangle of relationship drama.\r\n\r\nThere are a host of things that I didn't like about this movie. Starting out with the plot itself. It's as daft as they come. There are infinitely easier ways to murder one's wife than the method used by Gavin. It's needlessly complicated, there are way too many opportunities for failure, its entire success is hinged on a very unpredictable variable ... it's dumb. Hitchcock is known for his clever plots, but this certainly isn't one of them.\r\n\r\nAnother thing about the plot, the \"big reveal\" is completely spelled out to the audience long before Scottie comes to the realization himself . With a good thirty or forty minutes left in the movie, Madeleine/Judy writes a letter to Scottie completely illuminating the plot. She then rips the letter up. This really felt like a punch in the face to the audience. Instead of letting us figure it out as Scottie does, we're spoon-fed the twist. \r\n\r\nThen there's the pacing of Vertigo. Pacing is only mentioned in connection to movies if it's exceptionally fast or exceptionally slow. In both cases, fast or slow, poor pacing is frowned upon. And this movie is poor pacing at its finest ... or at its worst, more accurately. The first hour of the movie is an insufferable slog of Jimmy Stewart following Kim Novak, not saying a word. Investigative stalking is only interesting up to a point - and this movie goes twice as far as that point. There's no getting around it (for me at least), at 129 minutes, Vertigo is a snore. \r\n\r\nAlright, so after all the wordless following, the film finally unites Scottie and Madeleine/Judy on  screen. Supposedly, they then \"fall in love.\" Are you kidding me? The events of the last half hour of the movie prove that their relationship is superficial lust on the part of Scottie, and who-knows-what on the side of Judy. Seriously, in the last half hour of the movie, Judy is abused and domineered by Scottie - she struggles and opposes, but ultimately accepts it; while Scottie doesn't bat an eye. Am I supposed to enjoy this?\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of Mr. Scottie Ferguson, he is one of the most singularly unlikable characters I have seen on-screen in a long while. He is definitely the most unlikable main character I have seen in a film since ... I don't know when. I'm really confused as to whether or not this movie was trying to make me root for him. As I mentioned, his treatment of Judy in the latter parts of the story is shallow and degrading. He proves that he only \"loves\" her if she looks just right, has the right hair color and style, wears the exact right clothes, etc. So what is their so called relationship based on? What Scottie physically wants. It doesn't matter what Judy thinks or feels. Judy, the real person doesn't matter. Nothing that is real does, to Scottie. Only Madeleine, the unattainable dream, matters. Now, I wouldn't consider myself a radical feminist, but goodness gracious ... the misogynistic vibe this movie gives off is palpable. \r\n\r\nAnd sad to say, everything mentioned above is also often unintentionally funny. By the end, Scottie seems like nothing more than a psychotic pervert. Which I guess could be the point of the movie. But how am I supposed to care about what happens on screen, when I care so little about the main character?\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, what's the deal with the character Midge? She's set-up as a past flame of Scottie's. It's understood that she still has feelings towards him. But then she just disappears. Is there any reason why she was there in the first place? Is there any reason why she was written out of the script with no closure? \r\n\r\nThe acting doesn't leave much of a good impression. Somehow, someway, this movie manages to make Jimmy Stewart unstoppably unlikable. His performance isn't nearly as nimble as I would have hoped. Stewart was much better and more interesting in Rear Window, and he was stuck in a wheel chair that whole movie. Kim Novak also gives an unconvincing performance as Madeleine/Judy. She didn't, at any point, persuade me that she was in love with Scottie. Not that I blame her, but the movie requires it. And I wasn't convinced for a second. \r\n\r\nOn the plus side, Hitchcock's trademark direction shines through on multiple occasions. The opening credits are fantastically put together. There's a heck of a dream sequence halfway through the film. There is a beautifully neon scene in a hotel room. The cinematography is exceptional. And Bernard Herrmann's score, while not being specifically memorable, fits the movie very well.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on, but I feel like I've already said my peace. While there have been one or two Hitchcock movies I haven't particularly liked, Vertigo marks the first time the director has completely struck out with me. Every once in a while, I'll see an established classic (like Citizen Kane, Ghostbusters, or Bullitt) which leaves me shaking my head, asking \"why ... how?\" Welcome to the club, Vertigo. Congratulations.\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.\" 4/10",

I liked them all, but Vertigo exerts more attraction on me because it moves me more. I can see fairly well what makes them great and beautiful works of cinema but the slightest flaws or awkwardness are highly distracting... I'm probably not being fair by penalising the ratings because of such, after all these are movies from the 50/60s, a different and more naive mindset would be more appropriate to fully appreciate these works. I feel that Vertigo is a bit long, some superfluous scenes that could use a bit of cutting here and there, this is pretty much my only complain. The soundtracks is to die for and it's so effective!

            "content": "...No, I'm not quoting the startlingly mediocre U2 song of the same name, because I'm still mad about it winning Best Rock Song... and because this film is older than any member of U2. You know what, it's older than the Grammy's, and so help me, I am not even kidding, so I guess that would explain why people have suddenly started liking it. Oh no, don't get me wrong, I also think that the film is good, but if this was the 1950s, then I probably would be the only one, and that's where the critics' retrospective respect comes in handy, because now, it's called, like, Hitchcock's best film, with British Film Institute's \"Sight & Sound\" calling it the best film of all time. So, um, yeah, it can be safely said that this film has come a fair distance from its initial mixed reception, but only a fair distance. Jeez, the opinions on this film have been boosted up so high that I really am starting to have vertigo, although the people of the '50s may have just said that they weren't crazy about this film because they were annoyed about getting so dizzy. Hey, people were much more sensitive back then, and you actually need to see this film to remember that, because, yeah, it's not as thrilling as snobby critics like to think it is. Oh, people, I'm just kidding, and the film is good, like I said, although its thrills are limited, partly by, not simply its time, but by its subject matter's own limitations.\n\nCertainly meaty enough for a rewarding final product to be crafted, this film's story concept still has its thin spots as a borderline lightweight melodrama whose natural shortcomings limit potential, and grow harder and harder to ignore as consequential shortcomings rear their ugly heads deeper and deeper into matters. As if it's not enough that meat is limited in concept, Alec Coppel's and Samuel A. Taylor's scripted interpretation fails to keep consistent with genuine uniqueness that, while certainly present, goes betrayed by formulaic bits, many of which relate to some glaring histrionics that make storytelling just as distancingly overdramatic as it makes it distancingly formulaic. Perhaps it would be easier to bond with the story, through all of the melodramatic mumbo-jumbo, if the familiar narrative was made more recognizable by exposition, whose extensive moments are indeed pretty thorough, and whose lapses are very problematic in their exacerbating a sense of thinness to this character drama. The film doesn't seem to say as much as it probably should about its depths, and what it does have to say tends to be formulaic, or histrionic, or even excessive, because the film, to be so conceptually thin, ends up clocking in at well over two hours, getting there on the back of meanderings and overblown material, much of which get to be too overblown to keep evenly focused. Yes, well, I suppose the biggest consequential shortcoming to the final product is inconsistency, and it does end up being a pretty sizable one, plaguing a storytelling style that is sometimes almost abstractionist in its breaking traditional storytelling with a touch too much thoughtfulness and emphasis on imagery, in addition to a focal structure that abandons certain plot elements for much too long, and a tone that sometimes jars through fluff to get to intensity, which, in all fairness, was always to have only so much kick. Indeed, it does ultimately come down to the natural shortcomings, which are limited, - enough so for the consequential missteps to be overwhelmed enough by the strengths for the final product to compel pretty thoroughly throughout its course - but still stand, limiting potential that is further shaken by a certain looseness on the grip of originality, exposition, pacing and focus that could very well mean underwhelmingness for this effort. I wouldn't say that the film soars as much as many say, but when it's all said and done, this often messy affair genuinely rewards, with intriguing substance and, of course, a solid artistic value.\n\nParticularly celebratory of musical style, this Alfred Hitchcock film goes scored by Bernard Herrmann, whose efforts are conventional on the whole, but with refreshing elements, in addition to dynamicity that encompasses almost dreamy lighter elements, as well as subtly biting heavier elements, while keeping consistent in quality. The film's musical style is both fitting and lovely, and just that can be said about the film's visual style, as Robert Burks returns as a cinematographer whose bleak color pronunciation helps in selling the drama's grit, - until softer moments of lighting come into play and truly haunt in their beauty - and whose certain other filming aspects immerse you. The immersion value of the stylish film's photographic technicality is limited only by the fact that all of the trippy camera tricks and other nifty stylistic touches are more limited in quantity than many lead you to believe through their praise of the film's innovation of many techniques that are still hard to pull off now, but make no bones about it, style, whether it be in the form of haunting music or in the form of fine visuals, stands firm throughout the film, aesthetically and, to a certain extent, narratively bringing life to this thriller. Needless to say, the film isn't just style, and when it comes to substance, through all of the natural shortcomings which go stressed by melodramatics and familiarity, this story concept is pretty refreshing and well-layered as a psychological study on the unraveling of the human mind and of some intriguing conflicts, done justice by highlights in a script by Alec Coppel and Sam Taylor that go the opposite route of the lowlights by freshening things up, and offering tight characterization, sold by worthy performances. There are only so many performances to this minimalist character drama, and most all of them are pretty solid, and that especially goes for the lovely Kim Novak, as well as for leading man James Stewart, whose trademark subtle intensity captures the anxiety of a charismatic man who goes shaken by mental instabilities, made all the worse by other pressing personal conflicts. The performers carry the drama, and yet, no matter how solid they may be, they do not truly secure the effectiveness of the final product, at least not without the help of a directorial performance by Alfred Hitchcock that is stylistically outstanding, as I said earlier, and generally pretty well-realized in its meditativeness, whose thoughtful attention to depth draws on enough dramatic bite and noirish intensity to craft a tense, or at least compelling thriller. The missteps are hard to disregard, and Hitchcock himself makes a couple of them, yet where the final product could have ultimately slipped into underwhelmingness under the weight of its natural and consequential setbacks, Hitchcock's inspired efforts solidify the effort as both aesthetically stirring and dramatic engrossing.\n\nBottom line, there are certain natural shortcomings to this film's story concept that go stressed by conventions, histrionics, expository shortcomings, some dragging, and much unevenness in style, focus and tone that the final product finds itself at risk of, if you will, \"falling\" into underwhelmingness, but through excellent score work and cinematography, some clever writing, solid performances and effectively meditative direction, Alfred Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\" goes balanced out as a thoroughly intriguing psychological dramatic thriller.\n\n3/5 - Good",

Now at the time I watched this I decided I should view classical movies before the 70s, and honestly I didn't know what to expect as I didn't overly watch classics. However, after watching a movie that surprises on a spectacular scale, I can say 'Don't judge a book by its cover'. This movie delivers in a way that I've rarely seen. It explores the complexity of women and how much easier it is to make them who we want them to be instead of accepting them for who they are, which sounds like boring theme at first but trust me you will be converted towards the end. It's not just the idea, it's also the superb cast, or the superb actor, this movie has made it official that James Stewart is one of my favorite actors of all time. If you want to start watching movies from an earlier era, this is one of the movies to start with.",

Hitchcock crafted a marvelous picture that has  a lot to say about love, fear and... obsession. Jimmy Stewart does a stellar job of portraying Scottie Ferguson the vertigo suffering private eye. Kim Novak gives a good performance as the dual personality love interest with funny eyebrows and busty sweaters. The only silly part is the nun at the end of the film, for those of you who remember her reaction it is ridiculous. This film is a true classic though and has so many other likeable aspects.\r\n\r\nThis film is quite remarkable for the time and is an American classic. The restoration of this picture was quite the time consuming process and cinephiles all around the world should tip their hat to the folks who brought this classic back to life.

The beautiful vibrant colors on the car and the downtown shots of San Francisco take your breath away.

The unexpected death at the end makes you feel extremely uncomfortable and catches you off guard. Why did they not install a safety railing?? The beautiful score by Bernard Herrman is amazing.

Seriously, people, don't forget that this is the guy who gave us American classics like Rear Window and Psycho. The plot is a little ludicrous and it moves too slow to be really suspenseful. I must admit, it was kind of boring. However, the ending totally pays off.\r\n\r\nVertigo is the story of a police officer (Jimmy Stewart) who retires from the force after experiencing a dangerous incident with his vertigo problem (hence the title). He is soon contacted by an old college friend who wants him to follow his wife, because he thinks she has been possessed by the ghost of her great-grandmother. This is where I started to wonder \"Okay... where are you going with this, Hitch?\" But fortunately, there are no ghosts or supernatural events in this movie. \r\n\r\nAnd the problem here is that I actually predicted this. As it turns out, the husband hired an actress to play his wife, then elaborately faked her death after convincing Jimmy Stewart that she was legitimately possessed. And I predicted all of that. I know that a lot of people didn't, but within the first fifteen minutes, I had said \"Oh, there's two girls.\" It was a fluke thing, but it ruined a lot of the movie for me. It turns out that it was pretty predictable. I know a lot of people won't see it that way, but I sure as fuck did.\r\n\r\nSome of the dialogue is less than inspired, but that doesn't really take away from the twistiness of the plot. But what Vertigo is possibly best remembered for is its overall dark and glum tone. After thinking that the man's wife died, Stewart goes into a downward spiral, as he was in love with her (while he was actually in love with the actress). Then when he stumbles across her, he falls in love again without knowing that it's actually her. He dresses her all up to look like the wife in a series of scenes that are legitimately creepy. I ended up feeling no sympathy for his character, as he not only fell in love with his friend's wife, but he pretty much tried to bring her back from the dead by fucking with some random girl he found. It's messed up.\r\n\r\nThe best part of Vertigo, however, makes up for all of its flaws-- and I'm talking about the cinematography. The scenes where he gets dizzy are some of the best in film. I can't stress enough how well Hitchcock filmed the fear of heights. Absolutely uncanny. He uses dizzying zooms and camera angles to make the long drops down seem incredibly frightening. It's some of the most original film shots ever produced.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Vertigo: 7/10 stars. It's good, but not great as some people are making it out to be. It might be partly because I predicted the twist ending, but it just wasn't as gripping as some of his other films. But it's still a solid entry in cinema nonetheless. Keep your eyes peeled for his cameo at the beginning!",

            "content": "\"You know, the Chinese say that once you've saved a person's life, you're responsible for it forever.\"\r\n\r\nEvery decade or so, the magazine Sight and Sound reveals the top ten films of all-time with the help of the world's top critics. For many decades, the title of the greatest film ever made belonged to Orson Welles's Citizen Kane, a film that I define as decent, but very overrated. In 2012, a new champion was announced, and the film that ended up knocking Citizen Kane from it's top spot was Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo, a thriller that was highly ignored in it's original release but has eventually gone down as one of Hitchcock's best films, and the popularity for it has increased every year ever since. For me, Vertigo is not only a masterpiece compared to Citizen Kane, but it's The Master of Suspense's best film, period.  \r\n\r\nScottie Ferguson (James Stewart), a police detective suffering from vertigo, meaning he has a fear of heights, is called out of retirement by his old college friend Galvin Hester (Tom Helmore). We find out that Hester's wife Madeline (Kim Novak) has been mysteriously possessed and wants Scottie to investigate her sudden possession. Scottie, who's very skeptical, follows her around everywhere, and eventually realized that he's got more than he bargained for. (I would talk more about the plot, but there's so many twists and turns in Vertigo that it would be wrong to give everything away). \r\n\r\nVertigo also features Barbara Bel Geddes as Midge, a painter and fashion designer who is also girlfriend of Scottie, but finds suspicion in his assignment, Kim Novak also plays Judy Barton, a woman who looks awfully familiar to the possessed woman, and Alfred Hitchcock makes his usual cameo appearance by walking down the street, shown in the first ten minutes or so.\r\n\r\nIn 1958, when Vertigo was first released, it was a massive box-office failure. Hitchcock blamed he failure on Stewart, believing that a 50 year-old man and a 25 year-old woman do  not go well together. (It was this reason why Hitchcock gave the leading role to Cary Grant in his follow-up, North by Northwest). But I believe that Hitchcock was missing the point. I believe the chemistry between Stewart and Novak worked, because the complexity of the story, which is supposed to be very creepy, allows it to do so.\r\n\r\nVertigo was one of the many Hitchcock films that needed a massive restoration in order for the film to be preserved for future generations, and I must say, the restorers did a fantastic job. The cinematography of 50's San Francisco is amazing, beautiful, and disturbing to look at.\r\n\r\nWhen many people think of James Stewart, they think of him as George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life. When I think of James Stewart, I think of him as Scottie Ferguson in Vertigo. Why, you ask? Because in Vertigo, Stewart gives a very powerful, compelling, and complex performance that makes George Bailey look like his problems were a piece of cake. The complexity of his character is so crazy and torturing that it's easier to root for. In the first half, he was a man with a free spirit. In the second half, he's a crazed lunatic looking for a lost soul. I can't say much, but I was amazed, and with this performance, Jimmy Stewart is in the list of one of my favorite Hollywood actors. As for Kim Novak, she was beautiful, stunning, and outstanding as the role of the possessed woman, though that grey suit was very ugly; don't know what Stewart was thinking when he was admiring it. Barbara Del Geddes was also very memorable as Midge, the other woman, and Tom Helmore as Galvin Elster is very suspicious.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest thing of all in Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece is the score by Bernard Hermann. Hermann started out as a weak heart, scoring the atrocious mess that was Citizen Kane. But when the 50's rolled around, Hermann discovered Hitchcock and started scoring his films. In the case of Vertigo, which was I think his first collaboration with The Master of Suspense, I was stunned. Hermann's themes, such as a hypnotic repeated phrase during the madness of Novak and Stewart, and a beautiful, haunting piece, blew my mind. Had Hermann not done the score for Vertigo, it wouldn't have been the same. Man, that dream sequence would be an atrocious disaster.\r\n\r\nWith brilliant direction and cinematography, a chilling and outstanding Bernard Hermann score, the greatest performance from James Stewart, heavy twists and turns that made Hitchcock a film-making genius, and the greatest dream sequence to come out of a movie, Vertigo is Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece and is definitely deserved to outdo Citizen Kane on the Sight and Sound poll. \r\n\r\n\"One final thing I have to do... and then I'll be free of the past.\"",

            "content": "I like to be in a good frame of mind when starting a film, because if distracted, it will affect the way I process it. So, after a few false starts, I finally have seen VERTIGO, and what I feel to be the perfect example of a Hitchcock film. The story follows John \"Scottie\" Ferguson, a retired San Francisco detective who is called by a friend to follow his wife. Along the way, he falls in love and has some curious experiences revolving around mistaken identity and his fear of heights. Dare I say that James Stewart hasn't been better (at least in a Hitchcock film) than here. Kim Novak also acquits herself rather nicely in the typical Hitchcock blonde role, although I still think Grace Kelly is a slightly better actress. All of Hitchcock's tricks are put to full use here, and things start off brilliantly with my favorite title sequence so far. Saul Bass and Bernard Herrmann were two of Hitch's greatest collaborators, and they certainly did some of their best work here. From a story perspective, the narrative takes a number of twists and turns which a discerning viewer will probably figure out beforehand, but its the execution of said twists that really make them work. They aren't telegraphed, but rather are hinted at or suggested. And if there's anything that makes a Hitchcock film extremely watchable, is how he is able to manipulate audience expectations through the power of suggestion. From a technical perspective, there was quite a bit of impressive camera-work and photographic effects that add to a sense of disorientation and suspense. In particular, there are a few zoom in/track out shots that visually illustrate James Stewart's character's acrophobia. There was also a really trippy dream sequence that served as a nice reprise of the opening title sequence. Even the production design, sets, costumes, etc. added to the visual splendor. Even when the narrative slows down (to ease the tension), there's always something beautiful to look at, be it a person or one of the many on-location shots of downtown San Francisco. And finally, Bernard Herrmann's score was pretty much perfect, helping to build tension at the right moments and backing off when necessary. A couple key moments in the film happen sans score, and the mark of a good composer is knowing which moments to back off and let the drama speak for itself. Put together, all of the various production elements form a package which, to me, is the epitome of what Hitchcock brought to cinema. You have interesting (and attractive) characters, a suspense-filled story, brilliant camera-work and a rapturous score. Even the ending this time felt better than in his other films. Although it would probably benefit someone new to Hitchcock to start with something earlier in his filmography (to get a sense of progression), VERTIGO is probably the pinnacle of his style and certainly essential when it comes to film classics.",

Well, perhaps the first element I could point to is how long it took for the public to \"catch up\" to this film's intelligence level and actually understand it well enough appreciate it. When it was first released, this movie did not turn heads or spark all that many post-viewing discussions if you want to go by the major press coverage at the time. Reviews were mixed, and even those who seemed to like the film often seemed to misunderstand it, or not even bother trying. If all you can do is fall back on the apparent \"genius\" of an artist without even bothering to question the validity of the artwork itself, you aren't necessarily giving the best form of praise.\n     So, what changed? Well, I submit that we did. While surreal psychological films still exist today, they don't always jive with the modern audience as well as they perhaps deserve to. Inception and Black Swan are two recent exceptions to the rule. But what if one day in the future a film released and largely disliked today would become re-evaluated and hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece? Would any of us have really seen it coming. Tastes and appreciations change greatly over time, and Vertigo, a film largely misunderstood for many years, has finally found its spot in history to shine. In a repertoire filled with sub-par films like Strangers On A Train that actually received much praise, it's an absolute sin that one of Hitchcock's greatest works still remains obscure to so many.

Much of the rest of the film seems surreal with minimal dialogue and interesting cinematography, leading up to the death of Madaleine (Kim Novak). Then the film switches gears and is mostly about the impact on Scottie who had become infatuated with Madaleine. Often he appears to be in a trance and he becomes obsessive after meeting Judy who looks strikingly like Elster's dead wife. Scottie becomes controlling, trying to make Judy into the image of the woman he loved. She just wants him to love her for who she is but that cannot be. Fittingly, the film ends the way it began with drama and tragedy. This certainly is a fascinating view of human psychology and complex emotions. In order to appreciate this film it is almost necessary to watch it twice, once to understand the plot and then another time to spot the little details. Of all of Hitchcock's work, I would say I still enjoy Rear Window or North by Northwest better but this film at least deserves a viewing or two.",

Even when it seems like its going slow, it keeps you in suspense.  The environment and mystery of John Ferguson's (Jimmy Stewart) situation will keep you intrigued for the entire time.  The twist ending will leave you with your mouth hanging open, especially after the first time you view this masterpiece.  The plot basically starts out by Ferguson having an unfortunate accident on a rooftop while chasing a criminal.  Ferguson is a detective who loses his footing.  His fellow cop tries to save him but he falls to his death.  It is found out that Ferguson suffers from vertigo, which prompts him to leave his job as a detective.  Receiving encouragement from his good friend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) and a case from his old friend Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), Ferguson is forced to investigate a curious matter as a retired detective.  Ferguson is tasked to look after Elster's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) who has been exhibiting peculiar behavior.  This journey is not what it seems and its ending will leave you satisfied.  Jimmy Stewart as usual is brilliant.  Being able to portray so many emotions so authentically is Stewart's staple and it comes across well here.  Kim Novak is absolutely beautiful as Madeleine.  She first exhibits the confusion and the detachment that Madeleine is going through, but becomes more lucid as she falls in love with Ferguson, which is perhaps an unrequited love.  'Vertigo' will show you why Hitchcock is one of the greatest of all-time.",

My favorite Hitchcock film is \"Rear Window,\" but I still love this one, and it is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films.  It is a mixture of suspense, mystery, romance, drama, and neor.  Like all Hitchcock films it is really slow, and then it gets really suspenseful, and it is exciting at the end.  The first half is a bit of a neor/drama film that turns into a romantic suspense film that is dramatic and interesting.  The film had a great surprise twist at the end, and it is one that you won't see coming.  It shows how Alfred Hitchcock is still today the \"Master of Suspense.\"  This isn't my favorite as I said earlier, but one of them.\n\nHow I rank Hitchcock films of the ones I have seen.\n\n1.\tRear Window\n2.\tNorth By Northwest\n3.\tPsycho\n4.\tThe Birds\n5.\tVertigo\n6.\tDial M For Murder\n7.\tStrangers On A Train\n8.\tTo Catch A Thief\n\nPart of the films masterpiece is the invention of the camera technique called the \"Dolly Zoom.\" A dolly zoom is when the camera zooms in the opposite direction that it is moving.  When James Stewart gets vertigo in this the camera zooms forward while it moves backwards creating a vertigo effect.  The dolly zoom has been used in films like Jaws too.  It is a really brilliant thing that he invented for this film that truly did inspire many other films.\n\nVertigo is what you get when you are up high, and you have acrophobia.  John \"Scottie\" Ferguson (James Stewart) has acrophobia but he realizes he has it at the worst possible time, and it results in a man falling to his death.  Though it wasn't his fault he decides to retire from police work due to the guilt he feels, and because of his illness.  Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) his old friend lures him into another case in which he must follow his wife who has been possessed by some sort of spirit, and he doesn't know what to do.  All of the things that Ferguson finds her doing eventually is tied into the ending.  His wife's name is Madeleine (Kim Novak).  After he witnesses Madeleine jump into the San Francisco Bay, he gets her out and saves her life.  They then begin a romance that ends after she kills herself by jumping off of the tower from a church.  She ran up the church because she knew he wouldn't make it up because his acrophobia would return.  He did the whole thing to help him cure his acrophobia.  The rest of the plot I will save for you to see for yourselves.  \n\nIt is a great film with great acting from James Stewart, and brilliant camera work.  That is why it has been voted the greatest film of all time.  I love it so much.",

This guy really knows what he's doing with the camera - he leads your eyes to all the funny places in the frame he set up so well. He's even a greater master of arrangements and settings than with the camera.\n\nJames Stewart and Kim Novak play pretty well - Novak mostly in the second half, Stewart plays his trademark average Joe with distinctive epicness.\n\nAll in all, I must say not only Novak gets better as the film goes on, but also the whole film experience. This is why Vertigo didn't get a perfect rating - the first half is a bit more \"dull\" (ok maybe dull is the wrong word but compared to the second half which blows you away, the first half drags along a bit).\n\nNevermind, although I can't say it's the best movie I've ever seen (not even Hitch's best film I've seen so far), it's worth watching and definitely deserves the universal acclaim.",

I thought it to be fairly boring but I found myself surprised at some of the filming techniques and checked the date several times to make sure it was a 50's film. The \"big reveal\" was a stretch to say the least and I imagine this was not just a modernist's perspective. I am very liberal when it comes to remakes and updates and would love to see a modernized version of this made. In regard to the \"big reveal,\" I now understand why David Lynch said that he get's depressed when a mystery get's solved. The resolution is actually pretty good, but the reveal leaves you going \"oh really, that's it?

I enjoyed Psycho a bit more, and I believe that it is Hitchcock's true masterwork of cinema, but Vertigo belongs at the top as one of his finest works. Actor Jimmy Stewart delivers a strong performance as a retired detective who suffers from acrophobia and investigates a friend's young wife. The tension unfolds at a steady pace, and Hitchcock successfully keeps you on the edge of your seat due to a well written script and his choice of actors who are simply terrific in their parts. This is on e of the best films in the suspense genre, and is sure to leave you guessing right up till the end. Alfred Hitchcock definitely knows how to craft a solid picture, and he pulls out all his tricks on-screen with Vertigo. Glimpses of his later work are apparent and he would continue with such standout works such as his follow-up North by Northwest and the now highly regarded horror classic Psycho. This is perfect filmmaking that only Alfred Hitchcock could have done. The cast that he works with are wonderful, and Stewart is one of the film's standout aspect that make Vertigo a must see for Suspense fans.",

The master of the thriller genre Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo may intact be the definitive thriller/mystery film with its bold and grim story of madness, lust, and mystery. \n\nVertigo is a great film that had a very simple story a man is concerned for his wife's state of mind so he hires a detective to follow her, a detective who is afraid of heights (This comes into play quite nicely in the film's opening and in the main storyline).  James Stewart plays Scottie Ferguson, the detective on the trail. Stalking her every move the man believes his wife to be possessed or have \"something\" within her causing her mad and suicidal behaviour. The closer Scottie gets, the more fascinated with this woman, Madeleine he becomes. \n\nHitchcock's pacing of this film is brilliant, keeping you hooked and on edge for the entire length of the film.  The music fits quite nicely into the film's thrilling and mysterious tone and image as well as the realism, grit and darker atmosphere that begins taking over as the film progresses. I praise this as perhaps Hitchcock's definitive work of his career, for the film's story, its performances (notably by Stewart), pacing of the plot the mystique and a twist that not many pictures can pull off with a haunting and climatic ending. \n\nHitchcock's filming from his camera angles, movement and locations helped also bring forth the film's style and purpose. The film's haunting dream sequences and \"Vertigo\" sequences are also classic scenes and purely great. Vertigo is a fine work of classic cinema that still has significance in the art of film making today.",

            "content": "About two months ago, when Sight & Sound magazine announced their critics polls of my film of all time (a referendum carried out every decade), VERTIGO has unanticipatedly usurped CITIZEN KANE's seemingly invincible titleholder, which as a matter of course, has ensured many discordant responses, so it seems to be a perfect time to watch Hitchcock\u00e2(TM)s (at least currently) cr\u00c3\u00a8me de la cr\u00c3\u00a8me. \n\nI eschewed any possible spoilers before embarking on the film (a BluRay set of  1996 restored version), it has been fully testified (regardless of the faintly drawn-out stalking sequences, great framing nevertheless) that a stirring frisson is duly on the course of solving the absorbing doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger riddle. \n\nVisually there are some ground-breaking craftsmanship in the film, from the opening eye-focusing montages to the recurrent vertigo motif, even an abrupt cartoon snippet during the hair-raising nightmare scenes (which I estimate should be credited to the restore department). But the magnetic gravitation is the enigmatic pleasure from the perspective of a mutual love affair between a well-clad former detective and an equally enigmatic married woman (not the generic femme fatale brand though) whose motivation has been tainted since the very beginning. So in spite of that the set-up is almost immaculately deployed (until a rather second-rate glitch to culminate the finale), but one thing might not be so popular as it was half a century ago, the shifting role of female in the society, Kim Novak\u00e2(TM)s character\u00e2(TM)s vulnerability and fatalism infatuation just doesn\u00e2(TM)t feel sound enough to elevate the plot onto the final peak. Partially it is also the performers\u00e2(TM) problem, Novak\u00e2(TM)s glacial distance cannot pull herself through as a deft actor (neither for the scheme nor for the film), so it descends to a mere sexual impulse from James Stewart\u00e2(TM)s standpoint, which I don\u00e2(TM)t suppose is Hitchcock\u00e2(TM)s idea. Also Stewart\u00e2(TM)s paranoid \u00e2minute copy\u00e2? compulsion does mar some empathy toward him. \n\nThe film at bottom is a two-hander, so Barbara Bel Geddes and Tom Helmore are the only supporting roles which are all underdeveloped, particularly, Bel Geddes\u00e2(TM) s one-sided affection has a buoyant start but completely sidelined after her inappropriate painting incident, leaving an unusual loose end. \n\nSo the film has its old-fashioned value of love and done an acute anatomy of the hallucinatory symptoms when one falls for a feigned personality (the torture is bilateral), but calls it \u00e2the best film ever\u00e2? is a way too grave grandstanding which does no good to any films at all (even CITIZEN KANE has to pay its price), but I daresay 10 years later, VERTIGO will add another title under its belt, \u00e2a one-time champion of the best film of all time\u00e2?.",

My favorite Hitchcock film is \"Rear Window,\" but I still love this one, and it is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films.  It is a mixture of suspense, mystery, romance, drama, and neor.  Like all Hitchcock films it is really slow, and then it gets really suspenseful, and it is exciting at the end.  The first half is a bit of a neor/drama film that turns into a romantic suspense film that is dramatic and interesting.  The film had a great surprise twist at the end, and it is one that you won't see coming.  It shows how Alfred Hitchcock is still today the \"Master of Suspense.\"  This isn't my favorite as I said earlier, but one of them.\n\nHow I rank Hitchcock films of the ones I have seen.\n\n1.\tRear Window\n2.\tNorth By Northwest\n3.\tPsycho\n4.\tThe Birds\n5.\tVertigo\n6.\tDial M For Murder\n7.\tStrangers On A Train\n8.\tTo Catch A Thief\n\nPart of the films masterpiece is the invention of the camera technique called the \"Dolly Zoom.\" A dolly zoom is when the camera zooms in the opposite direction that it is moving.  When James Stewart gets vertigo in this the camera zooms forward while it moves backwards creating a vertigo effect.  The dolly zoom has been used in films like Jaws too.  It is a really brilliant thing that he invented for this film that truly did inspire many other films.\n\nVertigo is what you get when you are up high, and you have acrophobia.  John \"Scottie\" Ferguson (James Stewart) has acrophobia but he realizes he has it at the worst possible time, and it results in a man falling to his death.  Though it wasn't his fault he decides to retire from police work due to the guilt he feels, and because of his illness.  Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) his old friend lures him into another case in which he must follow his wife who has been possessed by some sort of spirit, and he doesn't know what to do.  All of the things that Ferguson finds her doing eventually is tied into the ending.  His wife's name is Madeleine (Kim Novak).  After he witnesses Madeleine jump into the San Francisco Bay, he gets her out and saves her life.  They then begin a romance that ends after she kills herself by jumping off of the tower from a church.  She ran up the church because she knew he wouldn't make it up because his acrophobia would return.  He did the whole thing to help him cure his acrophobia.  The rest of the plot I will save for you to see for yourselves.  \n\nIt is a great film with great acting from James Stewart, and brilliant camera work.  That is why it has been voted the greatest film of all time.  I love it so much.",

All I know is that 'Vertigo' manages to tell a side of humanity, in that we are all susceptible to becoming vulnerable in the general sense. We may have our strengths, but we will always have our weaknesses.\n\nIs there a lesson to be learned by any of this or do we just have to learn to live with this knowing that this type of ambivalence cannot be prevented all the time? Does 'Vertigo' answer any of this? I do not know if it does, but maybe you the viewer will think otherwise. Whatever you may be thinking about, 'Vertigo' is a film that every film lover should see. 'Vertigo' to me is a thriller that is very psychological in that it made me question a side of our humanity that plays a part in our interactions with people. Any story that can captivate me to a level beyond just being entertained for the sake of entertainment is the type of story I would definitely want to revisit again and again.",

I did like it, but I refuse to jump on a bandwagon of people saying how great it is.  Initially it wasn't even that great, but developed a higher appreciation later on.  However, it really disgusts me how this movie went from #61 on AFI's 100 movies to #9 just 10 years later and became #1 on a recent Sight & Sound list.  But, I'm getting ahead of myself.\nI liked this movie's suspense because I found it really interesting how this woman Scottie is following is connected to all these places that she is visiting for some seemingly unknown reason.  I also liked how it made a thrilling revelation,  but still had a portion of the movie left and made another shocking revelation.  However, there were also things that were a little ridiculous.  How the two fell in love was just weird watching it thinking he was protecting his friend's wife.  Obviously that didn't turn out to be the case, but it was still messes up.  I still give some credit to Hitchcock for this scene though because while it felt corny, it was suppose to because Hitchcock was suppose to be making fun of romance in movies such as this one.  I didn't hate this movie, I even liked some of the unusual things Hitchcock did to a degree, but overall to call it one of the best movies of all time (at least in my own opinion) is just out of the question.  I honestly do not see why people defend this so much.  Some say you need to see it twice and that is probably how it got more of an appreciation in later years.  However, other movies are like that.  There are other movies that some will say you need to see twice and I honestly do not see what is so special here.  Maybe it would feel different to watch it again, but I don't think it would matter much, because I would feel I would just be jumping on a bandwagon and I'd rather not do that in this case.  Maybe I will watch this movie again one day, but I will not give in to the majority.  I find it childish that so many critics criticized the AFI just because this movie was not high enough and that motivated the AFI to push it up 52 spots.  That is absurd and I think it is immature that a bunch of critics could take something like this so seriously.  Critics might as well criticize me for not loving this movie if .  I'm not going to be one of those people and if anyone wants to say otherwise they can because criticizing me personally does not make this a good movie and it's definitely not going to change how I feel about it.  Terrible? Absolutely not.  But best movie ever?  I don't think so.",

James Stewart's \"Scottie\" follows Kim Novak around a little too long which makes the film drag at the beginning and Scottie seems too old to be romantically involved with Kim Novak's Madeleine. Other than that, this is just masterful. There is so much to be awed by. The wonderful shots of San Francisco. Scottie's technicolor nightmare. Bernard Herrmann's beautiful score, which is on my short list of favorites. But I think I'm ultimately sold by the overwheming obesession that Scottie has for Madeleine. It's painful and at first you feel sorry for him and then it turns into some pretty disgusting behavior. When Kim Novak's character emerges from behind a locked hotel room door, the way she appears from a white-green haze, it's absolutely haunting.\r\nI don't think this is a perfect movie and I know it has recently been voted as the greatest film of all time by Sight & Sound. It's not in my Top Ten or anything but there is so much here that is so good I have no choice but to rate it as high as I can.",

Viewers may be bored by the lengthy drama, but if you are the kind that loves to see how it is going to turn out, then Vertigo is a movie for you.\n\nThe film stars James Stewart as former police detective John \"Scottie\" Ferguson, who had to retire due to disabilities (vertigo and clinical depression) incurred when a police colleague died trying to save him.\n\nScottie gets a call from an old friend who hires him as a private investigator to follow his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) who is behaving strangely.\n\nScottie begins the job which led to him falling in love and becoming obsessed with his work.\n\nThe screenplay is an adaptation of the French novel The Living and the Dead (D'entre les morts) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. \n\nAlthough Vertigo is fun to watch, it may be a bore at times and has so many loose ends. Some of the times the camera angles were weird, the use of the zoom to play out the vertigo feeling is to be praised though.\n\nWell if you are ready to sit 2 hours for a movie to thrill ya, then vertigo is it.

I understand why this movie grows on people as they watch it over and over, there's a lot more to see and notice once you have the benefit of the whole story.  I look forward to watching it again with all the extra layers already unveiled.   Scottie (Stewart) falls for a tortured woman who dies tragically, causing him a severe psychological damage. Once he is on the mend, he sees a dead-ringer for his lost love, and begins an obsessive, controlling relationship with her, shaping and molding her into the perfect copy of his love.

This being said, there is no shame in a director's work being lesser-than other entries in one's cannon - especially one as lofty as Hitchcock's. Watch for Alfred's usual jazzy camera techniques - made even more impressive without a computer around. Vertigo IS a true classic.

A couple of weeks ago, it was canonized for the next decade as the greatest film of all time by the esteemed Sight & Sound poll. It is indeed great, and there's a good bit of analyzing you can do of the film. It's very smart and layered and beautifully shot and it has Jimmy Stewart, one of the greatest actors ever.\n\nBut you know what? It honestly isn't even my favorite Hitchcock film. I find Rear Window much more gripping and interesting. Rear Window is tighter, it gets me to sympathize with Jimmy Stewart's character more effectively, it's scarier, and I like Grace Kelly better than Kim Novak. For a film that's supposed to be the greatest work by the commonly acknowledged master of suspense, Vertigo has remarkably little actual suspense. There's almost no point at which I feel like the characters are really in significant danger. Rear Window, on the other hand, just oozes with danger and suspense. Plus, the frumpish supporting character in Rear Window is a lot funnier than the frumpish supporting character here. Yes, of course any movie Hitchcock makes is going to be better than most directors could ever hope for. But if I were ever asked to vote in the Sight & Sound  poll myself, I would put Rear Window well ahead of Vertigo.",

But there's no doubt that it's Hitchcock's real masterwork beyond Psycho, NbN, Rear Window, Shadow of a Doubt and etc. Vertigo isn't just a mystery thriller, it's a psychological dense movie that reflects a lot of the concerns and issues that tortured Hitch's complex mind. It's like a director's redemption when confronted with a lot of mistakes he has made through the years. Most of all it's a beautiful poem that surpasses all his previous and future works.

My opinion hasn't changed.   Vertigo is a bloated, boring walkthrough that's been mimicked by episodic detective television ad infinitum.  While mildly interesting as a travelogue of 50's San Francisco, the pacing which Hitchcock uses to build suspense ultimately works against it and at times becomes tedious.    Vertigo does have openness and spaciousness that today's films lack.   Even the scenes shot on the studio lot look marvelous in VistaVision.  But, digital restoration is not kind to this film, visual clarity works against this film, emphasizing poor camera work and poor special effects.  Hitchcock's use of color might have been novel at the time, but it lacks subtlety and complexity. \n \nThe only redeeming quality of this film is the gracefully aging Jimmy Stewart and an intriguing Grace Kelly clone, Kim Novak.    I'd not noticed their chemistry decades ago, but the rapid pace at which their characters fall in love, especially in such a slow paced movie, is jarringly unrealistic.   Stewart wasn't suited for a psychological \"thriller\" such as this one, but he does deliver with a workmanlike professionalism.\n\nRecently a so-called poll of critics \"unseated\" Citizen Kane as the best movie ever made, replacing it with Vertigo.   I suspect that poll was very Anglo-centric as I cannot imagine that such a superficial, frivolous film such as this one would displace a dense, technically perfect masterpiece such as Citizen Kane.  A delight to cinema academics, Hitchcock does not disappoint with Vertigo, including his trademark motifs - platinum blondes and voyeuristic protagonists.   Hopefully, HBO's docudrama \"The Girl\" will shed some light on that obsession later this year.  \n\nSkip Vertigo, if you've seen one Monk or Matlock episode, you've seen them all.",

The first time I saw \"Vertigo,\" I strongly disliked it. I thought James Stewart was creepy, Kim Novak's performance was stiff, and the overall story was convoluted and uninteresting. After seeing it again, I was blown away by how much I loved it. Stewart's performance as the obsessive Scottie Ferguson is creepy yet effective. Kim Novak as Madeleine Elster is one of the most significant female performances in Hollywood history. Bernard Hermann's score for this film is one of my favorite film scores in any film ever. And, as always, Hitchcock's direction is nearly flawless. I won't give away anything about the plot, but seriously: watch this movie. You will not be sorry.",

            "content": "One of the prominent aspects Vertigo and Psycho, as with all Alfred Hitchcock films, is the musical scores by Bernard Hermann. It\u00e2(TM)s not so much the intensity of the music during climatic moments - although that aspect is present as well - but the many other scenes when a more low-key score builds the tension and foreshadows what is to occur later.  For every scene at the top of a church bell tower or in a shower, there are several scene on the roads of California that serve as rising action. The audience knows something is about the go wrong but they are left in suspense, adding significance to the event when it occurs. Hermann\u00e2(TM)s music is beautiful, yet very tense.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the prints that were screened at the Bloor Cinema were of poor quality and there were issues with the contrast in both films. This was especially critical in Psycho\u00e2(TM)s where the shades of grey that help define Hitchcock\u00e2(TM)s world view were not present and were replaced with muddled black darkness.\n\nHitchcock showed great originality in his camera shots. One really gets the impression that they are an observer of the desperate scheme which is about to go awry. Shots from above at the Mission San Juan Bautista show the aftermath of the two falls from the tower and close shots show the fear and terror of each victim at the Bates Motel. (On a side note, both films feature a number of scenes showing James Stewart and Janet Leigh driving, using rear projection to show what is happening on the road behind them. Chase scenes become slow and methodical, yet still as engrossing because one can see how the protagonist is reacting to their surroundings.)  The camera angles, such as the zoom in Vertigo and the shot of the door creaking open in Psycho helped make the films unforgettable.\n\nHitchcock\u00e2(TM)s films are not violent but succeed in providing the same overall effect by showing the outcome in great detail. The audience never sees Kim Novak\u00e2(TM)s body hit the rooftop tiles and Janet Leigh is never stabbed on camera but the reaction of James Stewart and the destruction of shower and bathroom provide more than enough detail.\n\nIt is also a trick that modern directors should learn. It\u00e2(TM)s not what blows up or how many people are killed but how one makes each act of violence important by creating suspense, developing a relationship between the actors and the audience, and employing wit as the plot unfolds.\n\nObviously, both films display the dangers of obsession, showing how a character can loose themselves and their values when they stretch an idea to its absolute limit.  But that has been discussed in numerous essays that are far more sophisticated than what is posted here.",

Certain sequences are extended for the sake of building tension (most notably the car scenes) that feel out of place in an artistic film and really only detract from the visual freshness of the movie. Hitchcock was clearly an artist as well as an entertainer, and he has proven both here, but the two halves of his talent seem almost to clash, creating a mixed bag of incredible imagery and pulpy thrills.",

            "content": "Still as flawless today as it was in 1958, Vertigo is about perception. Not what the characters perceive, but the audience. Carefully, yet deliberately, the secret to this film is revealed about two thirds of the way through it's two hour run time. Few films, if any, go about telling a story in such a manner. The fact that Vertigo is a thriller/mystery makes such a bold act even more compelling.\n\nThe ballsy move is done so cautiously and delicately that you think the shocking revelation signals the end of the picture. It was such a brassy ploy that Hitchcock himself was against adding the infamous letter writing scene. In a move that would go down in cinematic history, the studio insisted on including it in the final cut. They claimed that it would be interesting to watch Scotty (James Stewart) unravel something that the viewer knows but he doesn't. It was a brilliant decision. The picture wouldn't be nearly the same or as riveting for the viewer had that scene wound up on the cutting room floor.\n\nBy the time that Judy (Kim Novak) indulges us with her written affirmation, we are already hooked. We almost believe that Scotty has been overcome with madness much the same as Madeline Elster (also played by Novak) had been before him. What we want to know is: Was Madeline indeed possessed? Were the demons of a long lost ancestor driving her to insanity and her ultimate demise? Perhaps this wayward spirit now resides in Scotty. What in the hell just happened?\n\nIt's only after Scotty is drug through emotional mud do we begin to wonder. His brokenhearted wanderings around San Francisco reveal a man who's much more human than his retired cop personae first let on. It's not until he meets Judy that we begin to question things. Amazingly, Hitchcock shows us the same woman and we still have a hard time making the connection. It's amazing how dye job, a little eyebrow tweaking and some boorish dialogue can make us impugn identities. \n\nThe fact that Kim Novak is staring us in the face once more after Madeline's demise is a nifty trick, played on us by the master. Even after Scotty has a conversation with her, we don't realize the truth. We just assume it's Scotty's lovelorn wishful thinking. Hitchcock has been leading around like lost children to this point, and we gladly follow, our own inquisitiveness piqued. It's not until the audacious letter scene that we see Scotty's curiosity was warranted. There's much more to this Judy character than meets the eye.\n\nOf course this all leads us to where we wanted to go: Sweet justice for Scotty. Stewart's impassioned blustering on the steps of the bell tower is one of the most classic tirades ever caught on film. Both he and the viewer have been waiting for him to piece it all together. The fact that he returns her to the scene of the crime only sweetens the deal. Justice, sweet justice.\n\nThere's a reason that movies like this wind up on every critic's top ten list. Films like Vertigo are both compelling and challenging for the viewer. Everyday Joe's who are thrust into bad situations are the stuff that great cinema thrives on. What sets a film like this apart from other admirable pictures is perception. It's only when we become involved with that character's importunate mission that a movie becomes a classic. Few achieve this as thoroughly as Vertigo.",

            "content": "\"'Power and freedom'. Coupled together, these two words are repeated three times in Vertigo. First, at the twelfth minute by Gavin Elster ('freedom' under\u00ad lined by a move to close-up) who, looking at a picture of Old San Francisco, expresses his nostalgia to Scottie ('San Francisco has changed. The things that spelled San Francisco to me are disappearing fast'), a nostalgia for a time when men - some men at least - had 'power and freedom'. Second, at the thirty-fifth minute, in the bookstore, where 'Pop' Liebel explains how Carlotta Valdes's rich lover threw her out yet kept her child: 'Men could do that in those days. They had the power and the freedom ... ' And finally at the hundred and twenty-fifth minute - and fifty-first second to be precise - but in reverse order (which is logical, given we are now in the second part, on the other side of the mirror) by Scottie himself when, realizing the workings of the trap laid by the now free and powerful Elster, he says, a few seconds before Judy's fall - which, for him, will be Madeleine's second death - 'with all his wife's money and all that freedom and power ... '.Just try telling me these are coincidences.\n\nSuch precise signs must have a meaning. Could it be psychological, an explanation of the criminal's motives? If so, the effort seems a little wasted on what is, after all, a secondary character. This strategic triad gave me the first inkling of a possible reading of Vertigo. The vertigo the film deals with isn't to do with space and falling; it is a clear, understandable and spectacular metaphor for yet another kind of vertigo, much more difficult to represent - \u00adthe vertigo of time. Elster's 'perfect' crime almost achieves the impossible: rein\u00adventing a time when men and women and San Francisco were different to what they are now. And its perfection, as with all perfection in Hitchcock, exists in duality. Scottie will absorb the folly of time with which Elster infuses him through Madeleine/Judy. But where Elster reduces the fantasy to mediocre manifestations (wealth, power, etc), Scottie transmutes it into its most utopian form: he overcomes the most irreparable damage caused by time and resurrects a love that is dead. The entire second part of the film, on the other side of the mirror, is nothing but a mad, maniacal attempt to deny time, to recreate through trivial yet necessary signs (like the signs of a litur\u00adgy: clothes, make-up, hair) the woman whose loss he has never been able to accept. His own feelings of responsibility and guilt for this loss are mere Christian Band-Aids dressing a metaphysical wound of much greater depth. Were one to quote the Scriptures, Corinthians I (an epistle one of Bergman's characters uses to define love) would apply: 'Death, where is your victory?'\n\nSo Elster infuses Scottie with the madness of time. It's interesting to see how this is done. As ever with Alfred, stratagems merely serve to hold up a mirror (and there are many mirrors in this story) to the hero and bring out his repressed desires. In Strangers on a Train, Bruno offers Guy the crime he doesn't dare desire. In Vertigo, Scottie, although overtly reluctant, is always willing, always the one taking the first step. Once in Gavin's office and again in front of his own house, (the morning after the fake drowning), the manip\u00adulators pretend to give up: Gavin sits down and apologizes for having asked the impossible; Madeleine gets back in the car and gets ready to leave. Everything could stop there. But, on both occasions, Scottie takes the initiative and restarts the machine. Gavin hardly has to persuade Scottie to undertake his search: he simply suggests that he see Madeleine, knowing full well that a glimpse of her will be enough to set the supreme manipulator, Destiny, in motion. After a shot of Madeleine, glimpsed at Ernie's, there follows a shot of Scottie beginning his stake-out of the Elster house. Acceptance (bewitchment) needs no scene of its own; it is contained in the fade to black between the two scenes. This is the first of three ellipses of essential moments, all avoided, which another director would have felt obliged to show. The second ellipse is in the first scene of physical love between Judy and Scottie, which clearly takes place in the hotel room after the last transformation (the hair-do corrected in the bathroom). How is it possible, after such a fabulous, hallucinatory moment, to sustain such intensity?\n\nIn this case, the censorship of the time saved Hitchcock from a doubly impossible situation. Such a scene can only exist in the imagination (or in life). But when a film has referred to fantasy only in the highly-coded context of dreams and two lovers embrace in the realist set of the hotel room; when one of them, Scottie, thanks to the most magical camera movement in the history of cinema, discovers another set around him, that of the stable at the Dolores Mission where he last kissed a wife whose double he has now created; isn't that scene the metaphor for the love scene Hitchcock cannot show? And if love is truly the only victor over time, isn't this scene per se the love scene? The third ellipse, which has long been the joy of connoisseurs, I'll mention for the sheer pleasure of it. It occurs much earlier, in the first part. We have just seen Scottie pull Madeleine unconscious out of San Francisco bay (at Fort Point). Fade to black. Scottie is at home, lighting a log fire. As he goes to sit down \u00adthe camera follows - he looks straight ahead. The camera follows his look and ends on Madeleine, seen through the open bedroom door, asleep in bed with a sheet up to her neck. But as the camera travels towards her, it also registers her clothes and underclothes hanging on a drier in the kitchen. The telephone rings and wakes her up. Scottie, who's come into the room, leaves, shutting the door. Madeleine reappears dressed in the red dressing-gown he happened to have draped across the bed. Neither of them alludes to the intervening period, apart from the double entendre in Scottie's line the next day: 'I enjoyed, er ... talking to you ... ' Three scenes, therefore, where imagination wins over rep\u00adresentation; three moments, three keys which become locks, but which no present-day director would think of leaving out. On the contrary, he'd make them heavily explicit and, of course, banal. As a result of saying it can show anything, cinema has abandoned its power over the imagination. And, like cinema, this century is perhaps starting to pay a high price for this betrayal of the imagination - or, more precisely, those who still have an imagination, albeit a poor one, are being made to pay that price.\n\nDouble entendre? All the gestures, looks, phrases in Vertigo have a double meaning. Everybody knows that it is probably the only film where a 'double' vision is not only advisable but indispensable for rereading the first part of the film in the light of the second. Cabrera Infante called it 'the first great surreal\u00adist film', and if there is a theme present in the surrealist imagination (and for that matter, in the literary one), then surely it is that of the Double, the Doppelg\u00e4nger (who from Doctor Jekyll to Kagemusha, from the Prisoner of Zenda to Persona, has trod a royal path through the history of the medium). In Vertigo, the theme is even reflected in the doubling-up of details: Madeleine's look towards the tower (the first scene of San Juan Bautista, looking right, while Scottie kisses her) and the line 'Too late' which accompanies it have a precise meaning for the naive spectator, unaware of the stratagem, but another meaning, just as precise, for a watchful spectator seeing it a second time. The look and the line are repeated at the very end, in a shot exactly sym\u00admetrical with the first, by Scottie, looking left, 'Too late', just before Judy falls. For as there is an Other of the Other, there is also a Double of the Double. The right profile of the first revelation, when Madeleine momentarily stands still behind Scottie at Ernie's, the moment which decides everything, is repeated at the beginning of the second part, so precisely that it's Scottie who, the second time, is 'in front' of Judy. Thus begins a play of mirrors which can only end in their destruction. We, the audience, discover the stratagem via the letter Judy doesn't send. Scottie discovers it at the end via the necklace. (Note that this moment also has its double: Scottie has just seen the necklace head-on and hasn't reacted. He only reacts when he sees it in the mirror.) In between, Scottie's attraction for Judy, who at first was merely a fourth case of mistaken identity (the constant of a love touched by death; see Proust) Scottie encoun\u00adtered in his search through the places of their past, this attraction has crystallized with her profile in front of the window ('Do I remind you of her?') in that green neon light, for which Hitchcock, it seems, specially chose the Empire Hotel: her left profile. This is the moment when Scottie crosses to the other side of the mirror and his folly is born ...\n\n... If one believes, that is, the apparent intentions of the authors (authors in the plural because the writer, Samuel Taylor, was largely Alfred's accomplice). The ingenious stratagem, the way of making us understand we've been hood\u00adwinked, the stroke of genius of revealing the truth to us well before the hero, the whole thing bathed in the light of an amour fou, 'fixed' by what Cabrera (who should know) called the 'decadent habaneras' of Bernard Herrman - all that isn't bad. But what if they were lying to us as well? Resnais liked to say that nothing forces us to believe the heroine of Hiroshima. She could be making up everything she says. The flashbacks aren't the affirmations of the writer, but stories told by a character. All we know about Scottie at the beginning of the second part is that he is in a state of total catatonia, that he is 'somewhere else', that it 'could last a long time' (according to the doctor), that he loved a dead woman 'and still does' (according to Midge). Is it too absurd to imagine that this agonizing, though reasonable, and obstinate soul ('hard-hitting' says Gavin), imagined this totally extravagant scenario, full of unbelievable coinci\u00addences and entanglements, yet logical enough to drive one to the one salvatory conclusion: this woman is not dead, I can find her again?\n\nThere are many arguments in favour of a dream reading of the second part of Vertigo. The disappearance of Barbara Bel Geddes (Midge, his friend and confidante, secretly in love with him) is one of them. I know very well that she married a rich Texan oilman in the meantime, and is preparing a dreadful reappearance as a widow in the Ewing clan; but still, her disappearance from Vertigo is probably unparalleled in the serial economy of Hollywood scripts. A character important for half the film disappears without trace - there isn't even an allusion to her in the subsequent dialogue - until the end of the second part. In the dream reading of the film, this absence would only be explained by her last line to Scottie in the hospital: 'You don't even know I'm here ... '\n\nIn this case, the entire second part would be nothing but a fantasy, revealing at last the double of the double. We were tricked into believing that the first part was the truth, then told it was a lie born of a perverse mind, that the sec\u00adond part contained the truth. But what if the first part really were the truth and the second the product of a sick mind? In that case, what one may find overcharged and outrageously expressionistic in the nightmare images preced\u00ading the hospital room would be nothing but a trick, yet another red herring, camouflaging the fantasy that will occupy us for another hour in order to lead us even further away from the appearance of realism. The only exception to this is the moment I've already mentioned, the change of set during the kiss. In this light, the scene acquires a new meaning: it's a fleeting confession, a reveal\u00ading detail, the blink of a madman's eyelids as his eyes glaze over, the kind of gaze which sometimes gives a madman away.\n\nThere used to be a special effect in old movies where a character would detach himself from his sleeping or dead body, and his transparent form would float up to the sky or into the land of dreams. In the mirror play of Vertigo there is a similar moment, if in a more subtle form: in the clothes store when Judy, realizing that Scottie is transforming her piece by piece into Madeleine (in other words, into the reality he isn't deemed to know, making her repeat what she did for Elster), makes to go, and bumps into a mirror. Scottie joins her in front of the mirror and, while he's dictating to an amazed shop assistant the details of one of Madeleine's dresses, a fabulous shot shows us 'all four of them' together: him and his double, her and her double. At that moment, Scottie has truly escaped from his hospital chair: there are two Scotties as well as two Judys. We can therefore add schizophrenia to the illnesses whose symp\u00adtoms others have already judiciously identified in Scottie's behaviour. Personally, though, I'd leave out necrophilia, so often mentioned, which seems to me more indicative of a critic's neurosis than the character's: Scottie contin\u00adues to love a truly living Madeleine. In his madness, he looks for proof in her life.\n\nIt's all very well reasoning like this, but one must also return to the appearance of the facts, obstinate as they are. There is a crushing argument in favour of a phantasmagoric reading of the second part. When, after the transformation and the hallucination, Madeleine/Judy, with the blitheness of a satisfied body, gets ready for dinner and Scottie asks her what restaurant she'd like to go to, she immediately suggests Ernie's. It's the place where they first met (but Scottie isn't meant to know this yet - Judy's careless 'It's our place' is the first Vertigo: the Golden Gate Bridge. give-away before the necklace). So they go there without making a reservation. Just try doing this in San Francisco and you'll understand we're in a dream.\n\nAs Gavin says, San Francisco has changed. During a screening at Berkeley in the early eighties, when everyone had forgotten the movie (the old fox had kept the rights in order to sell them at a premium to TV, hence the cuts for commercials and the changed ending) and the word was that it was just anoth\u00ader minor thriller, I remember the audience gasping with amazement on seeing the panoramic view of the city which opens the second part. It's another city, without skyscrapers (apart from Coppola's Sentinel Building), a picture as dated as the engraving Scottie looks at when Elster first pronounces those two fateful words. And it was only twenty years ago ... San Francisco, of course, is nothing but another character in the film. Samuel Taylor wrote to me agreeing that Hitchcock liked the town but only knew 'what he saw from hotels or restaurants or out of the limo window'. He was 'what you might call a seden\u00adtary person'. But he still decided to use the Dolores Mission and, strangely, to make the house on Lombard Street Scottie's home 'because of the red door'. Taylor was in love with his city (Alex Coppel, the first writer, was 'a trans\u00adplanted Englishman') and put all his love into the script; and perhaps even more than that, if I am to believe a rather cryptic phrase at the end of his letter: 'I rewrote the script at the same time that I explored San Francisco and recaptured my past ... 'Words which could apply as much to the characters as to the authors and which afford us another interpretation, like an added flat to a key, of the direction given by Elster to Scottie at the start of the film, when he's describing Madeleine's wanderings; the pillars Scottie gazes at for so long on the other side of Lloyd Lake - the Portals of the Past. This personal note would explain many things: the amour fou, the dream signs, all the things that make Vertigo a film which is both typically and untypically Hitchcockian in relation to the rest of his work, the work of a perfect cynic. Cynical to the point of adding for television - an anxiously moral medium, as we all know \u00ada new ending to the film: Scottie reunited with Midge and the radio reporting Elster's arrest. Crime doesn't pay.\n\nTen years later, time has continued to work its effect. What used to mean San Francisco for me is disappearing fast. The spiral of time, like Saul Bass's spiral in the credit sequence, the spiral of Madeleine's hair and Carlotta's in the portrait, cannot stop swallowing up the present and enlarging the contours of the past. The Empire Hotel has become the York and lost its green neon lights; the McKittrick Hotel, the Victorian house where Madeleine disappears like a ghost (another inexplicable detail if we ignore the dream-reading: what of the hotel's mysterious janitress? 'A paid accomplice' was Hitchcock's reply to Truffaut. Come on, Alfred!) has been replaced by a school built of concrete. But Ernie's restaurant is still there, as is Podesta Baldocchi's flower-shop with its tiled mosaics where one proudly remembers Kim Novak choosing a bou\u00adquet. The cross-section of sequoia is still at the entrance to Muir Woods, on the other side of the bay. The Botanical Gardens were less fortunate: they are now parked underground. (Vertigo could almost be shot in the same locations, unlike its remake in Paris.) The Veterans' Museum is still there, as is the ceme\u00adtery at the Dolores Mission and San Juan Bautista, south of another mission, where Hitchcock added (by an optical effect) a high tower, the real one being so low you'd hardly sprain an ankle falling off it, complete with stable, car\u00adriages and stuffed horse used in the film just as they are in life. And of course, there's Fort Point, under the Golden Gate Bridge, which he wanted to cover with birds at the end of The Birds. The Vertigo tour is now obligatory for lovers of San Francisco. Even the Pope, pretending otherwise, visited two locations: the Golden Gate Bridge and (under the pretext of kissing an AIDS patient) the Dolores Mission. Whether one accepts the dream reading or not, the power of this once ignored film has become a commonplace, proving that the idea of resurrecting a lost love can touch any human heart, whatever he or she may say. 'You're my second chance!' cries Scottie as he drags Judy up the stairs of the tower. No one now wants to interpret these words in their superfi\u00adcial sense, meaning his vertigo has been conquered. It's about reliving a moment lost in the past, about bringing it back to life only to lose it again. One does not resurrect the dead, one doesn't look back at Eurydice. Scottie experiences the greatest joy a man can imagine, a second life, in exchange for 12 9 the greatest tragedy, a second death. What do video games, which tell us more about our unconscious than the works of Lacan, offer us? Neither money nor glory, but a new game. The possibility of playing again. 'A second chance.' A free replay. And another thing: Madeleine tells Scottie she managed to find her way back to the house 'by spotting the Coit Tower' - the tower which domi\u00adnates the surrounding hills and whose name makes visiting French tourists laugh. 'Well, it's the first time I ever had to thank the Coit Tower,' says Scottie, the blase San Franciscan. Madeleine would never find her way back today. The bushes have grown on Lombard Street, hiding all landmarks. The house itself, number goo, has changed. The new owners have got rid of (or the old owner kept) the cast-iron balcony with its Chinese inscription 'Twin Happiness'. The door is still red, but now blessed with a notice which, in its way, is a tribute to Alfred: 'Warning: Crime Watch'. And, from the steps where Kim Novak and James Stewart are first reunited, no one can see any more the tower 'in the shape of a fire-hose', offered as a posthumous gift to the San Francisco Fire Brigade by a millionairess called Lilli Hitchcock Coit.\" - Chris Marker",

This film bends the mind with its images and story, and makes the audience truly think as we must in all Hitchcock films, but this film really teases the mind and makes us ask questions.  It was initially not well received when it first released, and I honestly cannot imagine why.  Many incredible films were not well received by critics when they are first released but grow to be loved over time, such as Psycho, Fight Club, and The Shining.  But every image in this film is just pure beauty and somehow I am able to see the genius behind the scenes and able to see Hitchcock's great mind playing its tricks on us.  We see Scottie Ferguson slowly grow more and more in insane into his own love for this woman, but the woman is not as she appears, and a film that seems like a mystery soon turns into a mind bending thriller that at the very end leaves the audience with their jaws open and their mind still asking questions.  The cast here is also incredible, James Stewart plays his best role of his career (besides his performance in It's A Wonderful Life) and he is the first actor I think of when I think of a Hitchcock film.  Kim Novak's performance is genius in some way, I cannot put my finger on it but somehow her character is just as mysterious as she is.  Vertigo is one of the greatest films ever in cinema, and that is not something many movies can say.  It's thrilling, frightening, and most of all the film is beautiful.  This was the beginning and inspiration for many future mind twisting films, but no matter how many thrilling mystery films they make, it will be hard to live up to this incredible example of great film making, made by one of the best directors of all time.",

The story is an interestingly weaved mystery.  The main character Ferguson (James Stewart-excellent performance until the last half when his character makes his efforts unlikeable) is asked to tail an old friend's wife who is acting strangely.  Is she a victim of demon possession or is she crazy or is it a hoax?  Unfortunatley, it is the one of thes that is least interesting to me.  The main character falls for his friend's wife and tries to understand the strange nature within her and the events that he experiences.  The best part of the movie is the animated scene which makes the viewer immersed in the feeling of vertigo.  An excellent movie that would be great to me, if the director, Alfred Hitchcock (a great director, but here he was misguided), had known that his story was interesting and gripping until the final twenty to thirty minutes.  Thought the surprise at end left me in awe, it was still not enough of twist to compensate for revealing the biggest trick (biggest twist) of the film so early.

There's a lot more to the story, but that's about all I can say without giving any of the story away. It's got a great style to it, vibrant colors and classic character makeup and design. The sets are gorgeous and the world of Vertigo will have you dizzy before the films end. The cinematography here is proof that Hitchcock truly was untouchable, as he does things with the camera that even many directors today wish they could do. The biggest problem here is that the story moves a little slowly, and even changes genre. The first hour and a half will have you questioning reality, while the last half hour will have you thinking of your own mortality. \r\n\r\nThe Cast: James Stewart, Kim Novak, Barbara Bel Geddes... James Stewart is Detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a crippling fear of heights and a love that wasn't meant to be drive this character from one extreme to another. One of my favorite leading actors in Hitchcock's films he always gives strong performances, and this one is no different. While it's arguable that this isn't his greatest performance and that Rope is still the best, there's no denying that this film would be the same without him. You'll love him for who he is, but hate him for who he becomes. Kim Novak plays a dual role here as both Madeleine Elster and Judy Barton. Madeleine Elster being the rich mans wife, a mentally unstable woman with a strange fixation on her ancestral history. Judy Barton being a woman that looks like Madeleine Elster. Barbara Bel Geddes is Marjorie 'Midge' Wood, Johnny-O's best friend. One problem here... What the hell happens to here? She just disappears after that last half hour kicks in. Where did she go? What's she doing? Why isn't she around anymore? She gives a great performance while she's on screen, it just would have been nice to see her get the ending she deserves. \r\n\r\nOne to Five Scale: 4 \r\n\r\nIt's strengths are enough to keep it steady at a four, but you're still left with a slightly slow paced story that builds to somewhat lackluster ending. It makes you wonder if maybe it should have ended a half hour sooner instead of changing genre and story. \r\n\r\nTyler",

I'm not a big fan of it but I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen this movie yet. I just felt like it ended the movie abruptly. However it doesn't ruin the movie for me at all and the Foreign Censorship Ending found on the DVD is worse.\n\nOther then that I don't have anything else to say that won't spoil anything, because like \"Psycho\" the beauty of this movie to those who haven't seen it is not to spoil anything that happens.

To have this much space and time for character building in presence of so many twists and turns is possible only by geniuses. This taps a deep chord on so many emotions and in many levels too, be it romance or heartbreak, suspense or obsession. It's >120 min runtime felt like, what! movie got over already? Thanks to exhilarating yet sensible screenplay.\r\nJohn Ferguson (James Stewart) resigns as a detective when his fear of heights leads to a death of his colleague. Then a college mate calls him on a personal favor to watch over his wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) as he suspects she is possessed with her grandmother's spirit invoking suicidal tendencies. During his surveillance John is convinced there is a greater power acting upon her when he saves her from drowning after which she doesn't recall how it happened. He falls in love with her and she reciprocates. When all seem to be going well, Madeleine commits suicide in front of him by jumping off a church building and he could not save her in time due to his condition. After a few years of depression, he finds a women who looks exactly like her and becomes obsessed. The more closer he tries to get to this women, darker the secrets that come out of the closet.\r\nThe plot may sound preposterous for those who are not used to Hitchcock movies, but it is definitely one of his better ones. Kim Novak definitely has the looks to make us feel plausible that one can get obsessed with her. The background score for both the romance and suspense episodes of the movie is incredible and complements very well with the terrific screenplay which builds the suspense revealing and adding the pieces strategically. The lead characters are so well written it is hard not to feel for them. It does have it's limitations too - though the idea of the main twist to the tale is smart - it is executed so unconvincingly as there are quite a few plot holes here. Hitchcock was never good with concluding movies, always end hastily and undercooked.\r\nAn exceptional storyteller delivers his best work of what I have seen in this slow building romantic-thriller.",

            "content": "\"Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past - someone dead - can enter and take possession of a living being?\" - Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) in Vertigo\r\n\r\n\tAlfred Hitchcock has a good handful of film that are considered to be stone cold classics. Whether it's North by Northwest, Rear Window, Psycho or even his earlier films like The 39 Steps and Lifeboat, many a critic and fan consider his filmography the best of all-time. The American Film Institute honored Hitchcock's 1958 triumph Vertigo as the 9th greatest film of all-time in 2007. It was also honored by the AFI as the #1 Mystery film, and 18th greatest display of both thrill and passion. But for the modern viewer, is Vertigo really a true Hitchcock classic?\r\n\r\n\tThe film kicks off with an enthralling rooftop chase with a criminal, police officer and John 'Scottie' Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart). In mid-chase, Ferguson botches a roof-to-roof jump. Fast forward to later and Ferguson is a scarred and retired detective moping around San Francisco with his guilt and newly attained acrophobia due to the stress of the rooftop event. One day he contacted by former college buddy Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). After catching up, Elster tells Ferguson of the recently strange behavior of his wife Madeline (Kim Novak). Elster believes that it's not simply a disease or growing apart from her but instead is convinced of paranormal possession. Reluctantly, but intrigued, Ferguson agrees to follow Madeline around at Elster's request, to observe her odd behavior.\r\n\r\n\tHitchcock always is precise, manipulative and innovative in his film technique and always effectively \"directs the audience\" with his thrillers, but with Vertigo he turns in a visually arresting work of art as well as a passionate romance and compelling yarn of mystery. Filmed around San Francisco, Hitchcock makes use of all of the city's most recognizable landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and Muir Woods and takes in all of their beauty in very rich colors. From one of cinema's most memorably trippy opening credits to the last frame of the film, Hitchcock fills every scene up with some stunning images. One particularily poignant sequence is a scene filmed in a beautiful flower garden while Ferguson follows Madeline through.\r\n\r\n\tThe story, based off of a 1954 novel, is perfectly directed by Hitchcock, wisely written, and beautifully performed by its small but always integral cast of characters. A screenplay, especially for that of a thriller, is always great if the viewer wants to watch it again as soon as the end credits roll. Vertigo accomplishes this nearly impossible task effortlessly. Stewart, always the everyman, is believable in a role that would be a struggle for any actor, a guilt ridden detective with an intense fear of heights and an increasing obsession is potentially difficult to believe as a character but Stewart's chops make it impossible for any viewer to doubt his sincerity. Kim Novak is gorgeous and turns in an equally admirable performance as the mysteriously behaving wife.\r\n\r\n\tHitchcock is one of the rare directors that has appreciation of both critics and audiences alike and is a legend for still being able to keep that grasp on decades after the opening of his films and even his own death. Vertigo is another indisputably timeless Hitchcock classic with pleasing aesthetics, defining style, a palpable story and an ultimately unforgettable, and rightfully Hitchcockian, conclusion. Just like a classic, Vertigo is a simply a movie that stays in the audiences minds and hearts.\r\n\r\nGrade: A+\r\nReviewed by Ben Pieper on March 8th 2012",

There are a few elements that do not stand the test of time which include a bit too much special effects (of the time) and does not leave it to the imagination removing a bit of the suspense.  Another aspect that takes away a bit of Hitchcock's element of surprise is that the background information on the events of the film are revealed too soon which also removes some of the element of surprise and might not appeal to all fans of film.  While everything is being experienced from the perspective of James Stewart's character throughout the film, the film breaks away and reveals information from the perspective of a different character with plenty of running time left.  For Hitchcock fans, the style and storytelling are sufficient and it remains a classic in its own right.",

James Stewart is unbelievably good, playing a retired detective who falls in love and eventually becomes obsessed so that after his love is dead, he won't give her up. He is AMAZING; I argue it as the best performance in the history of film in fact.

I think this is in large part due to that completely heart wrenching plot that both pulls you in faster the an Alaskan bass fisher, with twists and turns like a roller coaster, leaving you holding on for dear life, then spiting you out like a wad of chew from an overweight truck driver.

            "content": "\"Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.\"\n\nHitchcock's Vertigo is considered by many critics as the best film ever, although this wasn't always the case considering that when it was released in 1958 it was poorly received by audiences and critics alike. So much so that it marked the last time that Hitchcock worked with James Stewart who he blamed for not attracting audiences any more due to his age. Unfortunately it was the last collaboration between the two, but they left us a rich legacy. Hitchcock also blamed Kim Novak's performance, but if he were alive today he would realize what a mistake those two claims were. First of all, I believe Kim Novak was enchanting in this film, she was the perfect femme fatale in this sort of film noir suspense thriller. She was attractive and hard to decipher. James Stweart was also great and once again is believable as this obssesed man who is following this mysterious women all over San Francisco. His fear of heights, which is a key part of this film, is also believable and thanks to Hitchcok's technique (now known as the Vertigo shot) those scenes worked extremely well. However, the best thing about Vertigo is the strange twists it takes and how it surprises us with the direction it takes half way through the film. It is hard to clasify this film and it goes places you never imagine. This is what Hitchcock does best in his films and that is why he is considered as the Master of Suspense. The psychological elements are always present and everything is so masterfully crafted in this film that it is hard to break out of the enchanted atmosphere created here. \n\nThe film's theme of obsession is probably why it is called a masterpiece considering no other film has explored this subject as well as Vertigo does. I personally prefer Rear Window, another collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock, as his masterpiece although that film is more generic and easier to classify. In Rear Window Hitchcock explores voyeurism, in Vertigo a man's obsession over a mysterious woman who he feels attracted to. Actually there are two women who Stewart's character relates to in this film. Other than Madeleine (Kim Novak) who is the woman he is assigned to follow around the city he also shares a close friendship with Midge (played by Barbara Bel Geddes) his former love interest from his college days. Midge is an intelligent women and the perfect one for Scottie (James Stewart), but as he becomes more and more obssesed with Madeleine she begins to be sidelined. The only issue I had with this film involved some of the dialogue scenes between Scottie and Midge during the beggining of the film which served to set up the story and their background. It never felt authentic but it accomplished its purpose. Once Kim Novak enters in the picture and the theme of obsession kicks in the film really picks up and seduces the audience into its mysterious and eerie atmosphere. It's unpredictable, but I wouldn't say this thriller is as scary as Psycho, another Hitchcock film I would rank above Vertigo. I really loved this film despite some pacing issues during the beggining and midway through the stor, but other than that I agree with the claims that this is a masterpiece and a must see for film lovers everywhere. Just like Citizen Kane this is a film that was ahead of its time and one who the contemporary audience wasn't ready to embrace.",

            "content": "The 1950s found Alfred Hitchcock in his prime. Freed from both the shackles of the British studios and the meddling of David O. Selznick, he was finally free to make the films he wanted to make, exactly the way he wanted to make them. This period yielded many works which have become cemented classics - Strangers on a Train, Rear Window and North by Northwest. But Vertigo is arguably his finest work, being unbearably suspenseful and the greatest depiction of obsession in all of cinema.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was received mixed reviews when first released, Vertigo is now recognised as a highly influential work on filmmakers. Individual directors have paid tribute in their own way: Martin Scorsese has waxed lyrical about it in interviews with the AFI, while Mel Brooks used it as one of the main bases for his affectionate parody, High Anxiety. Its impact on the horror and thriller genres is plain to see, influencing films as varied as Single White Female and Mulholland Drive.\r\n\r\nThe ironic thing in all of this is that Vertigo is not a characteristic Hitchcock film. It does not conform, at least not entirely, to the various tropes and conventions which we now associate with Hitchcock. Most of his thrillers are driven by narrative: the story is everything, and the characters involved in it are there only to advance the story in which they find themselves. Vertigo is more of a character study, with the narrative and much of its complexity deriving directly from Jimmy Stewart.\r\n\r\nHitchcock described Vertigo as his most personal film, and it isn't hard to see why. Apart from the artistic freedom that he enjoyed making it, much of the film is self-reflexive: it is about his approach to filmmaking and especially his attitude to women. Hitchcock famously remarked that actors should be treated like cattle - being pushed and prodded around, told what to do, with someone else doing all the creativity. This approach is writ large in Vertigo in such a way that the characters mirror it directly.\r\n\r\nScottie, played by Stewart, is Hitchcock, obsessively analysing people's motivations and behaviour, following them at length and attempting to mould them to look and act the way he wants. His dark obsession with Judy reflects Hitchcock's fascination with blondes: he wants her to be 'Madeleine', her character, because that it is the only version of her he cares about. But for all his hard work, no understanding is gained; the relationship is one of fascination, but never comprehension or satisfaction.\r\n\r\nA comparison can be drawn between Vertigo and Peeping Tom, Michael Powell's incendiary masterpiece from two years later. Both films have male protagonists who are obsessed with perfection, which they convey or project in their attitude to women. Both films are self-reflexive, shedding light on the relationship between a filmmaker and the actors who end up in font in his camera - a relationship which, in both cases, turns out to be fatal. And both are triumphs of their genre, which fulfil expectations in terms of terror and suspense while still feeling fresh and ground-breaking.\r\n\r\nA further similarity between the films is their extraordinary cinematography. Robert Burks collaborated with Hitchcock extensively between Strangers on a Train and Marnie, and his mastery of Technicolor is on a par with Powell's old master, Jack Cardiff. The recurring deep, passionate reds are as dazzling as anything in The Red Shoes, and are complimented brilliantly by the piercing, threatening blues of the New Mexico skyline and Stewart's purposeful eyes. The film invades your senses with its manipulation of colour, with every shot brimming with menace and intent.\r\n\r\nEqually impressive are the dream sequences. These are better integrated than the dream sequence in Spellbound, famously directed not by Hitchcock but by Salvador Dali. Hitchcock may not have the literacy of Dali when it comes to Freudian imagery, but the effects are impressive for the day. Better still is the image of Kim Novak as Judy emerging as 'Madeleine' - she appears to shimmer as fantasy and reality attempt to merge into a macabre fairy tale, to the internalised delight of Scottie.\r\n\r\nA further highlight of the film is Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack, perhaps his best and arguably his most famous other than Psycho. As Scorsese observed in an interview with Sight and Sound, the score is built in spirals and circles, mirroring the obsession of the character as he keeps coming back to the same point. The score is ever-present but not intrusive, perfectly judging every scene and never doing the work for the actors, as can often happen in melodrama.\r\n\r\nBut what makes Vertigo ultimately so suspenseful, and so successful, is its confidence and attention to detail which is present in every aspect. Everything about its plot, its character construction and execution of suspense has been meticulously figured out, and yet it still has the ability to keep us guessing and genuinely surprise us at each turn. There are few thrillers which are so confident about the strength of their twist that they feel the need to withhold it for so long and so willingly. The twist when it comes is an absolute belter, rewarding our attention and pulling us further in.\r\n\r\nIf Peeping Tom is the cinematic Bible on voyeurism (with Blue Velvet a very close second), Vertigo is the accompanying volume on obsession. It shows with great detail and intelligence how unhealthy fascinations can start with something so small, and grow almost beyond the host's control until they have consumed everything else. Scottie takes the snoop job as an innocuous favour to an old friend; the first sight of Madeleine plants into his mind a seed of sympathy, a desire not to see her harmed. From the moment he has saved her life, this desire grows into fascination, to the point where he cannot imagine life without her (hence his silence at the sanatorium).\r\n\r\nThe story of Vertigo is a further reflection of obsession. We are made to study the characters, asked to decipher their every facial tic until we too are in danger of becoming obsessed with them. The twists and turns that occur make us simultaneously elated and frustrated - elated at what truth they reveal, frustrated that we could not spot them sooner. Both the characters' story and our experience of it end as they began - with one big shock which cements these emotions.\r\n\r\nJimmy Stewart was blamed by Hitchcock for the film's failure when first released. Hitchcock thought the age gap between Stewart and Novak was too obvious, and the two never worked together again. In hindsight, it was a triumph in conveying the theme of a seemingly innocent man being manipulated and corrupted - a process which he both resists and encourages. Stewart, once the wholesome leading man in Mr Smith Goes to Washington and It's A Wonderful Life, is transformed into what is arguably the most skin-crawling character in 1950s cinema. It is a masterclass in subtle madness, and remains his finest performance.\r\n\r\nVertigo is a terrifying triumph in every aspect of its execution. Hitchcock's subsequent efforts saw his abilities gradually diminish, but here the master is at the peak of his powers. The story is complex and rewarding, and the atmosphere which Hitch creates through lighting, music, colour and composition, is unbearably tense. Like Mulholland Drive more than 40 years later, Vertigo will pull you in to its dark, troubled world until you are unable and unwilling to escape. If you come away from this review convinced that I am obsessed, it means that the film has done its job.",

            "content": "In 1952, the British magazine Sight & Sound had asked the world's best film critics to put together their lists of the ten greatest films of all time. Every ten years since then, they've continued doing this poll and Citizen Kane has kept on maintaining its #1 spot since 1962. But as we've all heard last year, the outstanding streak of Citizen Kane has been put to an end as another film has taken over the #1 spot in its place. That film is none other than Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 classic, Vertigo. \n\nNow many people are probably curious about my answer to this question: is Vertigo really the new Citizen Kane? My personal answer to that question is yes. With all due respect to Citizen Kane, I always thought Vertigo had a more intriguing, complex story, more compelling drama, and is just as artistically accomplished in its cinematography as Citizen Kane ever was. Like I mentioned in my review of Rear Window, no list such as the Sight & Sound's can change the fact that we all have our own opinion regarding what our favorite film is. But in regards to this particular development, I think Vertigo being crowned the #1 film on the list is a step in the right direction. \n\nIn Vertigo, we follow John \"Scottie\" Ferguson (James Stewart), a retired detective with a great fear of heights, as famously shown in the opening scene when he's hanging on the edge of a rooftop, who reluctantly agrees to do a case for an old college friend (Tom Helmore). This case requires him to keep an eye on his friend's wife (Kim Novak) who is allegedly possessed to commit suicide. One day on the job when he sees her try to commit suicide by jumping into the San Francisco Bay, he rescues her and takes her to his home to rest and recover. \n\nWhat later results is a relationship that quickly becomes one of the most unique and fascinating love stories ever put on celluloid. I'm going to avoid giving away the big plot twist in the middle of the picture. Just let me tell you that it's not only surprising the first time you see it as it should be, but it also adds more drama and complexity to the rest of the picture, including the central romance, as a good plot twist should do. \n\nJames Stewart once again shows us his unbelievable versatility as an actor. With this role as well as his work in Rear Window and It's a Wonderful Life, we see the typically charming James Stewart persona with a little dark edge. Stewart is one of the few actors we can connect with no matter how dark certain characters he plays are. Whether he's wishing he was never born, intruding on his neighbor's privacy from a safe distance, or in this case falling in love with someone that reminds him of another person he loves, we somehow can find some aspect about his characters that we can relate to or identify with. \n\nKim Novak is also very good in this picture. I forgot to mention that she plays two characters in this film and she plays them both equally well. The other character she plays is another love interest that looks very identical to his other love interest to the point where that reason alone is why she loves her. If it sounds like it's complicated to describe, then it's easier to watch and obtain the connection between the two love interests first-hand since it's a crucial part of the plot twist. \n\nI've stated earlier that Vertigo's Technicolor cinematography was artistically accomplished and I stand by that statement. Just like Hitchcock's earlier film To Catch a Thief, the colors just really pop out at you, especially with the scenes at the flower shop and the hotel room with the turquoise light. It's not just the colors and the lighting that make the cinematography exquisite, it's also the way they were shot particularly with the innovative shot known as the dolly zoom. This is basically when the camera is physically moving away from the subject while zooming in on it, which in turn enhances the distance or the height of the subject significantly. \n\nThe musical score by the great Bernard Herrmann is also fantastic. It enhances the mystery, the emotion, the drama and the mood of the story tremendously, but it also is very memorable and sticks in your mind for the next couple days, weeks, or months as great musical scores should. Often considered not only one of Hitchcock's finest works but one of the finest films in general and deservedly so, Vertigo stands the test of time very well and holds up to multiple viewings. So if you like Citizen Kane, you'll pretty much like this even more.",

I felt he was a bit miscast.  maybe humphrey bogart was just so good at playing the more hard-boiled detective types that I always look for someone like him in these roles, or maybe Jimmy Stewart was just so good at playing the humble everyman like he did in scores of movies such as \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \"Harvey\", \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\", and even Hitchcock's \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" that I have a hard time believing him as scottie.  another weakness was that all the characters are so flawed that it can be difficult empathisizing with them.  the only truly DECENT character in the whole film was Barbara Bel Geddes' Midge.

The \"vertigo shot\" remains a classic as well, and the acting is near-flawless. My one knock on the movie is also its most damning element: the story could have been told in (at most) half the time and achieved the same emotional effect. The pacing was just awful, and for at least 2/3 of the movie it felt like the plot wasn't moving forward. When it was, the movie was perfect--when it wasn't, there were moments of boredom, and the rest of the film just couldn't overcome that for me.

Vertigo, in fact, could be summed up as just that--people at their worst, being driven to insane acts. For love? For money? Beauty justifying self-worth?\n\nIn Hitchcock's case, the dark muse from which he became inspired must've scarred his ego. The themes of chasing, deceit, infidelity and obsession in Vertigo have a connect-the-dots feel, a realness.

As in all his films, Hitchcock manages to create staggering, heart pounding tension out of the most trivial of circumstances, and once again truly earning his crown as 'The Master of Tension'. Stewart gives a brilliant performance, brilliantly capturing the essence of Johnny's character and how this changes due to the situation; Kim Novak also shines. An utterly engrossing plot, once again aided by the direction, and a film which really does have an impact when, and after, viewing. My only criticism would be that a couple of the secondary characters seem to be slightly forgotten due to the film's blood-pumping climax but this could well be intentional and only seems a fault due to my ignorance. All in all an excellent and thought-provoking film.",

You can expect the movie to be more of a 'Vertigo' theme. You can also expect it to be made in such a familiar Hitchcock way that you'll know it's worth watching the film. Now, when it's familiar, it's never predictable, if that's what you're thinking. By familiar, of course, unfamiliar, in Hitchcock's terms.\r\n\r\nWatching Vertigo is like reading a thriller novel. It starts off with a revelation. And it ends with a twist. So, the revelation which we get early on is the death of John \"Scottie\" Ferguson's policeman friend. As Scottie realizes that he has a fear of heights (acrophobia), he quits his job as a detective. Intrigued? Not yet. Hitchcock is teasing you, playing with your want and need for suspense early on.\r\n\r\nIn comes another case. Although Scottie is reluctant, he helps his friend, Mr. Gavin Elster, to tail his wife. \"We're happily married.\" he says. So, what's the deal? Ah-ha! Now we're getting somewhere. According to Elster, his wife has been possessed by a dead person. Wait, haven't we heard of this one before? A retiree coming out for one last hurrah? Sure, but no one does intrigue like Hitchcock does.\r\n\r\nThe plot, predictable at first, with Scottie following Madeline Elster everywhere. He finds out a couple of weird happenings, and as he gets to the bottom of the mysterious case surrounding surrounding Elster, the whole movie just gets better and better. Why? For one, there's James Stewart's fantastic performance. Great might be an apt word. But, Kim Novak stole the spotlight. Her double portrayal of Madeline Elster and Judy Barton (Who's Judy? ha, another twist!) was fantastic. Actors back then had charisma, no doubt about that. But, Novak had great chemistry not only with Stewart, but with the audience. There was almost a certain swagger in her that just never falters.\r\n\r\nSo, the ending. It's a lot more climatic than other scenes, and again, the 'Vertigo' theme is incorporated. Hitchcock's films seem ahead of its time, cinematography and plot-wise. Oh, to uplift the mood even more, almost every scene is aided with some panicky and well-timed background music. \r\n\r\n\r\nNot bad, not bad at all from Hitchcock. His knowledge of turning a seemingly unentertaining script into something much more is most admirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally*... Acrophobia is in fact, NOT associated with vertigo.",

Along the way, a man asks Scottie to use his detective skills to follow his wife Madeline (Novak) because she's been acting strangely lately. But while that job happens, he begins to fall in love with her, until a twist happens. Alfred Hitchcock's career was really close to its peak, and would soon climb in the later \"Psycho\". Personally this is not my favorite Hitch film compared to \"Rebecca\" or \"Rear Window\", but it's still very good. At the time of its making, both critics and audiences weren't sure if they liked it or not, getting a lukewarm response, opposite of what it is now. Like I said, this is not his greatest, but it deserves every single award it gets. Every minute is creative and innovative, and is more artistic than most of his films. The VistaVision here looks very different than the earlier \"To Catch a Thief\"-- it looks so dreamy here, giving it a far away effect. When you add the haunting score into the mix, every technical thing is in top form. James Stewart's career was waning at this point, and even though he was still considered Hollywood royalty in '58, he was not the leading man he used to be. I really consider this to be his last amazing performance. Kim Novak proves to be overrated here, more known for her looks than her acting skills. However, she does a superb job, and though not as versatile as Barbara Stanwyck or Carole Lombard, she does her best. \"Vertigo\" is a great look in Alfred Hitchcocks career, although I do not recommend for first time viewers-- start with \"Dial M for Murder\".",

Now I've seen Vertigo, and it was pure genius all the way up to the twist ending. I have to say thank you to Alfred Hitchcock for undoing my hatred towards twist endings something M. Night Shyamalan instilled within my brain, but now thanks to Hitchcock I can learn to enjoy again.\r\n\r\nThe movie stars James Stewart, a retired detective who is hired by a friend to follow his wife around for her own safety, and boy do things really start to spiral downhill for Stewarts character after this. I'd rather not say anymore for fear of ruining a key moment to the film, but I will say this if you've not seen this movie go see it.

It's not structured the way a thriller so often is, both nowadays and in the era when it was released, in that the pacing can be considered particularly slow at times. However, if viewers can get over that stigma, they'll find a highly captivating story of a traumatized detective hired for one more case, a case he is woefully unprepared for. Jimmy Stewart is brilliant as usual as the lead, Scottie Ferguson, bringing his every-man, sympathetic persona to a character that could have easily come across as a completely unsympathetic, unstable and unlikable individual had a lesser actor taken the role. Instead, as the case unravels and his fears and obsessions begin to take hold, Stewart's portrayal brings mixed feelings of pity and disturbance, an intriguing train-wreck that is a broken man trying desperately to keep himself together, and failing. Co-star Kim Novak is similarly brilliant as the mysterious woman that Scottie is asked to investigate, a woman he finds himself falling for, only to find he's fallen for what is quickly proven to be a deceptive performance, and not entirely a willing one on the deceiver's behalf. The mystery, as many will claim, is one that quickly solves itself before the film's climax, but this isn't meant to be a mystery film, it's a character study, one that shows just what past traumas, obsession, and fabrication can do to a person, and the ensuing consequences that can result from their attempts to deal with such things. It all plays out like a massive car pile up, a horrid sight, but one you can't take your eyes off of, and I mean that in the best possible way. Hitchcock at his prime was a master at pulling off this sort of thing, and Vertigo may well be the prime example of this mastery.",

Costumes played a major role in this film when it came to hiding Judy Barton and works very well.\r\n\r\nFor a long while I was thinking that the Madeleine Elster which Jimmy Stewarts character was hired to follow had multi personality disorder once Jimmy Stewart\u00e2??s character John 'Scottie' Ferguson began to ask her questions and she answered differently than what really happen and again when he was asking her in the redwood forest.\r\n\r\nI didn't like the scenes where you would go back and forth a bunch of times to look at Jimmy Stewarts face and then look at Madeleine Elster car as it turned.\r\n\r\nI did like some of the locations and angles chosen to shot in this film such as the Golden Gate Bridge.  I also liked the scenery seen out the windows; such as the cranes out the window or the city.\r\n\r\nI thought that once John 'Scottie' Ferguson went out of the psychiatric ward house that the film began to get a little strange and John 'Scottie' Ferguson became a little to obsessed with trying to make Judy Barton at the end of the film be like the one he had been hired to find, Madeleine Elster.\r\n\r\nI thought that it was interesting about the lighting and colors chosen to be used during this film. In particular the lighting was interesting in one scene where John 'Scottie' Ferguson and friend, Midge Wood are in the library talking to a librarian about someone\u00e2??s tombstone that John 'Scottie' Ferguson saw and asked about the significance of this name. It was not the conversation that was interesting but instead how the lighting suddenly just got darker as though the sun went down but no oranges or reds occurred but instead it was more like a cloud blocked the sun so the lighting just went darker. The other unusual thing was that this happened so casually that it was not too noticeably till it already occurred.\r\n\r\nI did like the twist made in the film when the letter was being made telling from another perspective what had happened to far.\r\n\r\nI was impressed by Midge Wood painting that she created of the painting but just replaced and put her own face on instead.\r\n\r\nThere were several scenes in the film that because of the lighting I thought they were paintings of scenery such as the red woods because the scenes seemed to be so dark unless the camera was closer to the actors it seemed more like a painting than the real thing. I was also impressed with the hotel room with the letters all green when John 'Scottie' Ferguson is in the room. I thought that the hotel letters were a painting since the green lighting on the actors was so odd.\r\n\r\nI liked one scene when John 'Scottie' Ferguson and Judy Barton  are kissing while the camera is spinning you see them in the hotel one moment, then by the carriage and then back in the hotel room.\r\n\r\nI think that one of the major things which were a downer to how come I was not satisfied with this film was the ending. I did not like how the final character died and was not satisfied. If she had died in a different way, she had been arrested instead, or had fallen in love with John 'Scottie' Ferguson after given an explanation I think that I would have been much more satisfied with the ending. The nun at the end was like what the freak is this! That was like such a random element who was not even introduced earlier and just pops up. Sorry no. After that we should have been told that this was a dream or a thought in the psychiatric ward house by John 'Scottie' or someone like Midge Wood.\r\n\r\nI felt that this is a film that needs to be watched at least twice so that you can notice some of the smaller details missed the first time in the film.",

The story is about the dizzying passion of a man for a woman who, in a sense, does not exist. Like many of Hitchcock's films, this lures us into unsettling psychological depths. The main character is a former police officer who quit because of a serious condition of acrophobia (fear of heights). He is privately hired to follow and spy on the suspicious wife of his friend. The wife is a chilling character. She is ghostly in demeanor but very seductive and beautiful. She visits the same hotel, museum, and cemetery everyday but never remembers doing so when asked. Eventually the two meet and the plot begins to seem predictable.  Hitchcock uses excellent cinematography technique to build suspense around this woman. And as for the main character, we do feel for his predicament and desperation. The ending is a classic display of unbearable passion. I would imagine that this film would make an interesting case study for professional film reviewers. \r\nFootnote: There are two other movies that, I am confident, have borrowed settings from this movie - Batman in its climactic bell tower sequence. And the Matrix, in its beginning rooftop foot chase.",

Jimmy Stuart masterfully plays against type as John \"Scotty\" Ferguson, an ex-cop who suffers from severe acrophobia and takes on a detective case for an old friend, unaware just how deeply entangled he will become in the case and how the ultimate outcome will end up wounding his psyche, leaving  him obsessed with the girl he was trailing and fell in love with. Stuart is not all that likable here, and is even disturbing and scary at times as he goes about desperately trying to control events that are beyond his control and trying to recreate things that just can't be recreated.  Kim Novak is hot as hell and sells her role beautifully, easily drawing the audience into her story. She too is a victim of sorts. The cinematography is fantastic (where Hitchcock encourages and allows our eyes to wonder over Novak, it's also perfectly surreal at times and shows off the beauty of San Fran a good deal as well), and the score is beautiful and haunting.  Vertigo is a film with many different layers. It's a tragic story where no one wins in the end, and everyone leaves a little bit more hurt than they were before.  It's a masterpiece, and not only is it Hitchcock's absolute best, it's also one of the greatest films ever made.",

He retires i shame, but is asked to tail a woman named Madeleine who he begins to fall for. I can't reveal any more without spoiling the film, although I am very tempted. The film has a very unique way of using silence to create suspense, such as when Scottie is creeping through the cemetery. One thing that I will say is that this is one of the weirdest films I've seen in a while (but not as weird as \"Tokyo Gore Police\") because it seems a little bit out of whack at certain moments, because it feels a little rushed, such as when \"Scottie\" asks Madeleine about her latent memories and suicidal tendencies. The ending also feels shockingly awkward and forced, but it's cliffhanger style is still effective. Despite my criticism, I still very much enjoyed \"Vertigo,\" and it's part of my \"Personal Gold Collection.\" I understand that some people will be turned away by the unusual story, so for those of you who fit that category, you should see either \"Rear Window,\" or \"Psycho.\"",

He will have to follow his wife's friend who is believed to drive into madness...\n\n\n\nHitchcock is irresistible.His realization is outstanding it's not only an expert using the camera but a genius and a master.The sequences of the movie are all perfect and some scenes are just amazing;The shot where john escapes from the scene of the crime is marvellous,with this beautiful view from the top of the tower.The editing is in the same range beautifully made and almost perfect .It is very fluent as only masters can do.Beside the cinematography rocks.The way it is used in the scene in the bookstore where the story of  Carlotta Valdes is told by the local historian is absolutely stunning.More the story told gets strange and unbelievable more the screen becomes dark and the atmosphere fascinating and disturbing.It is indeed very powerful.\nThe screenplay doesn't deceive either. Without having the best dialogues in the world there is an impressive work on it.Its quality is remarkable.You can see Hitchcock was a writer himself by listening to it.Everything is well made and developed. \nIn fact this movie on a Technically level is probably among the best ever made and the best the reviewer has seen despite some fault due to his era. \n But Further the acting is also of first rate.The two leading characters James Stewart(especially) and Kim Novak are great supported as they are by a great cast.\nHowever as often with the great directors the cohesion comes from the fact  that Alfred Hitchcock uses his great technical skill and the acting of his actors to serve the story.Even going further as only genius do by making it .He uses his skills to make the story itself.He is not only showing you a story but actually telling it creating it with his incredible style and skill at the use of camera.The way he creates the atmosphere of the movie is just outstanding.This is art .It is no more a simple good movie but a work of art.\n\n\nNow It could be enough but the story in itself is unthinkable  by his sharpness and intelligence.Like in most of the great thriller movies or other kind of there is an impossibility to know the end.This is how smart and well written the story is.The twist is great .For once it is pleasant to see a movie maker who doesn't treat his audience as stupids cow but rather as thinking people.\nIt could be discuss for hours about the deeper meaning of the story about its relevance and the ultimate consequences of lies and the inevitable judgment of God .The madness created by love and its contradiction with selfishness who inevitably leads to destruction. But lets be fair it will last too long.Just to say that with Hitchcock \"vertigo\"   love is destruction itself.\n\nVertigo is an absolute classic.\n\nPS:recommended to everyone even those who don't like it :P",

Hitchcock made some of the greatest movies ever made, and 'Vertigo', though by no means his most accessible film, is quite possibly his crowning achievement. It is without any doubt a masterpiece, and I cannot fault it in any way. Every time I watch it I am knocked out, and every time I see something new, some nuance or moment that I appreciate more than I did the previous viewing. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most popular movie star in Hollywood history, gives a remarkable performance throughout, one of the best in his career. Stewart had worked with Hitchcock before, and had always been superb, especially in the much copied suspense classic 'Rear Window' a few years prior to this, but he plays against type in 'Vertigo' and is jaw-droppingly good. It's difficult to remember now that 'Vertigo' is regarded as a movie milestone, that it received many bad reviews when it was originally released, and was a relative failure for Hitchcock. A lot of this had to do with Stewart's intense performance I think, and also the difficult subject matter. 'Vertigo' is essentially a tale of sexual obsession, something most people were probably not expecting at the time! Almost as good as Stewart is Kim Novak ('The Man With The Golden Arm') in a role that she will always be remembered for. 'Vertigo' is a virtuoso piece from Hitchcock, and a movie that will no doubt continue to inspire other film makers over the years to come. However the most important thing about it is that it is still wonderful viewing, and a movie experience that you will never forget. In my mind it is one of the three of four greatest American movies. Simply astonishing.",

            "content": "4.0/4.0\r\nAlfred Hithcock's \"Vertigo\" undoubtedly deserves its status as one of Hitch's best movies and one of Hollywood's most important movies. It is still today haunting, mysterious and sometimes poignant.\r\nAt its core, the movie is a love story - the tale of a man obsessed with a woman. The man is James Stewart in a great performance as San Francisco police detective John \"Scottie\" Ferguson (James Stewart) who retired after realizing he has acrophobia (fear of heights, which of course will serve as the foundation of some of the movie's memorable scenes) that led to the accidental death of a partner while saving him. He meets an old, now-rich acquaintance Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) who hires Scottie as a private eye to keep an eye on his wife Madeline (Kim Novak) who is acting peculiarly and her husband believes she is haunted by a ghost from the past. As he follows her, it is clear the beautiful Madeline is enthralled by a long-dead woman called Carlotta Valdes (she visits her grave, stares at a museum portrait of her and checks into an old hotel under her name). When she drowns herself and he saves her, Scottie starts to draw nearer to and fall for his subject. \r\nThe love story and obsession elements of \"Vertigo\" sometimes overtake the mystery element (the plot twist is actually revealed two-thirds into the movie) but despite that, the movie never loses its haunting and thrilling feel. Stewart delivers a landmark performance as an old lonely man who grows overtly obsessed with this woman. But it is Novak who is a real revelation as she excellently delivers on a somewhat difficult and challenging role (dhe actually plays two characters in the movie but I won't reveal more on that). Barbara Bel Geddes is also good as Midge, the fun friend and confidante of Scottie who has a soft spot for him. \r\nThe film was adapted to the screen by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor, based on the French crime fiction novel The Living and the Dead (D'entre les morts) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, and the movie does have some of the poise of the greatest European movies. The San Francisco setting really helps. Hitchcock's takes audiences on a tour across the city (mostly filmed on location) and many of the important landmarks will last in one's memory as they served as the setting of some of the movie's more beautiful scenes from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Mission San Juan Bautista on the outskirts, which is the setting for the famous bell tower scenes (worth noting, the tower was destroyed long before the shooting and had to be matted in with a painting using visual effects). Long time Hitchcock collaborator Bernard Herrmann delivers a haunting, perfectly suiting score that is one of the most memorable in cinema history. \"Vertigo\" is definitely one movie that will stay with you long after you have seen it.

But while Keats and Scottie both experience madness, their means of escapism are towards two different ends: the one towards a sort of Platonic Love for the Idea of Nature, the other towards Erotic Love for a woman who never really was - obsession at its finest. Which explains why the film's title - Vertigo - may well have been Hitchcock's best decision with regards to his greatest work.\n\nCritics and viewers alike today rank the usual things - Stewart's and Novak's non-Oscar nominated performances that are among the finest in film history, music that resonates with perhaps the most fabulous work of obsession (Tristan and Isolde), Saul Bass' opening titles that grab us from our seats, and last but not least, the surprise ending that would have compelled the AFI to rank this as the greatest mystery thriller ever concocted - individually and independently. But in my firm opinion, it is the mix of these elements (like every great film) and the sum of its exquisite parts - Stewart's and Novak's performances, Herrmann's music, Bass' titles and so on - that give light to this masterpiece that still, after all these years, surpasses the expectations of many a film critic in 1958, who ranked this gemstone in an undeserving low-end position. This is artistic genius expressed in the biggest and greatest apotheosis in the history of cinema - Vertigo.",

Film bears remarkable direction from Alfred Hitchcock, the locations with crafty cinematography and lighting. Hitchcock brings more of his seriousness and dedication. Soon after the staged fall of Madeleine (Kim Novak), the story of film seems to run high above the sensation that it creates. Scottie's (James Stewart) obsession grows drastically.\r\n\r\nStewart's lip-lock kiss with Novak while set turns to horse-stable (location of Stewart's warmly exchanged smooch with Madeleine before she runs to her death) is most greatest scene in the history of cinema from my perspective-view. Vertigo comes with memorable music-score from Hitchcock's long-collaborator Bernard Hermann.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Re-watched 7th time since 2007",

It really set the mood of the whole movie right form the gecko. The cinematography was also exceptional in this movie. I enjoyed how the old fashion mystery music was able to draw suspense among me. I did not feel the love between Novak and Stewart. I felt it went a little too far, especially at the end of the movie. If this movie is not followed closely some people could get confused. Now for Alfred Hitchcock's part. Wow! He did a really great job in my opinion. I have heard only a bit about him before watching this movie and I was impressed.

He becomes both victim and villain, creating both sympathy and revulsion as he reveals the potential perversity of film viewing and what happens when we fall in love with an image rather than a flesh and blood human being. In the end, isn't Scottie's desire to remake Judy into his ideal of Madeleine merely the obsessive film fan's desire for the repetition that cinema offers? Furthermore, such themes only scratch the surface of what Vertigo has to offer, all while wrapped up in a moving, visually stunning picture. Perhaps this explains why so many directors and cinephiles return again and again to Vertigo. I know that I will.",

The first half of the film was really like a bad trip, I mean he's just following this 'psychotic' woman, who just happens to be smoking hot. Ok so what guy wouldn't want to fall in love with her? Is she a ghost? Is she real? Is she really crazy? Ultimately Det. Scotty doesn't care and eventually I didn't either. \r\n\r\nThis film is about obsessive love, erotic infatuation and ruse gone wrong. Well, horribly wrong. I don't want to give too much away though because the ending is where it matters most. \r\n\r\nThere is some marvelous camera work here too. Of course including the memorable 'vertigo' shots. And some great scenes of note, the spinning, swirling, dream-like kiss that transcends time and space (in Judy's apt.) you'll know it when you see it.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the first half of the film is intriguing yet very slow paced. Meticulous if you will. It centers on the supernatural. The second half of the film heats up a bit and was more about the erotic obsession of Det. Scotty. The best demonstration of it since Onibaba (just not better or deeper than Onibaba). The ultimate cherry on top is the finale which will leave your mouth agape. I was staring at the screen chanting..NO..no..no.\r\n\r\nGreat film in many ways, and is almost deeper than you can imagine (given the Carlotta storyline and how she basically haunts the entire film).",

            "content": "\"Vertigo\" is a 1958 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. A film about obsession. I would put it among the 5 greatest films ever made. I must confess here, that this blog is also inspired by this film. The showman of popular cinema, Mr. Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since. The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place.\r\n\r\nTalking too much about \"Vertigo\" is not a good idea. There's too many obvious spoilers in recounting the plot of the film. \"Vertigo\" is a uniquely personal film, not only for Hitchcock, but for a broad array of viewers who, like me have latched onto its tragic story.\r\n\r\nMy favorite scene?\r\n\r\nWell... There are many actually. A particular scene with mesmerizing camerawork is when James Stewart(Scottie) and Kim Novak hug. We see from Scottie's point of view- the ghostly figure appears in the eerie green-tinged neon light reflected from the hotel sign outside the window. Her metaphysical, spiritual figure assumes solid shape as she moves out of the ghostly green light and crosses the floor to him, to embrace and kiss passionately. The camera pans and swirls around them (their background surroundings dissolve and place them in the livery stable in Scottie's subjective imagination, a location very important to the film)- the sensation must be the same distorted but gratified feelings Scottie is experiencing- vertigo. Completely lost in the dream, overlapping fantasy and reality, the loving couple continue kissing in front of the pale, greenish haze of the window. Also the definitive dolly zoom effect (the camera is pulled away from a subject whilst the lens zooms in to create the \"falling-away-from-oneself feeling\") on the staircase of the bell tower to create the vertigo dizziness.",

It's not my favourite Hitchcock - I haven't developed the sentimental attachment to it that I have to a few of his other films, but I can pretty much say without shadow of a doubt that this is his best. It's incredible, undeniable, haunting... and I wouldn't really call it a thriller at all. More a supercharged noir/romance. Although \"supercharged\" is too reductive and mundane a term.\r\n\r\nThe score defies classification too - in all honesty you could have set it to [i]Rocky IV[/i] and it would have made the film an instant masterpiece. The Bass/Herrman combo is an extremely potent one, whether it's a Hitchcock film or a Scorsese one, but the opening to [i]Vertigo[/i] is probably their best collaboration. You just fall forward into it, without realising that it's just a title sequence.\r\n\r\nThe plot itself takes a few liberties, but it doesn't matter. It's a great story, and the character development is quite extraordinary. Scotty is transformed into something truly repulsive, making the casting of the affable Jimmy Stewart a stroke of genius. And Kim Novak, well... nice chest. I think the thing that stuck with me the most in the film, apart from the score, is what is perhaps the most extraordinary use of colour in any film, particularly the ever-present, ever-dueling reds and greens.\r\n\r\nIn short, maybe it is \"only a bloody movie,\" but it's a pretty darn good one.",

Even though an evening on the  sofa is never a well-spent one, unless it includes cuddling with your significant other and/or hilarious amounts of alcohol. This is one of Hitchcock's most famous works and deservedly so. It includes the director's trade mark male lead-James Steward, who plays a detective who gets entangled in an emotional vertigo thanks to his fear of height and willingness to help a friend who hires him to watch after his wife(Kim Novak) who, he fears, suffers from a mental disorder. But the retired detective has no idea he's just a marionette in his friend's plan to murder his wife...\nHitchcock is the king of suspense and this film brilliantly shows why that is so. He leads you into thinking the story is over when Stewart ends up in a mental institution, but it's only then when it starts unfolding. Kim Novak has a radiance similar to Grace Kelly, her appearance is just as regal and attention-commanding, but there's something oddly dry in her acting in comparison to Kelly. Stewart does his best work in the film when he confronts Novak with her compliance in the murder plot, he's the embodiment of authority, even though Novak seems to break like a porcelain figurine in his firm grab. In the end, you're left bedazzled by how the director misled you to believe you had it all figured out.",

This Mystery/Thriller is not only intriguing, but this has to be one of the sickest, most twisted love stories I've ever seen.\r\n\r\nRight from the top the movie grabs your attention as a chase on the roof leads to a detective's acrophobia. But the detecive is asked by a friend to do one more job: To follow his wife and find out what she's been up to. When the detective does follow the woman, he not only finds out that the wife thinks she's a dead woman, but he falls in love with her. What turns out to be an interesting mystery turns into a creepy phemonena, which turns into a desturbing tale on necrophilia. This might not make sence at first, but trust me, when you watch this movie (which you should) you'll see what I'm talking about.\r\n\r\nAlfred Hitchcock does yet another amazing job of playing tricks with the viewer's mind with hidden symbolism, creative camera shots and the great use of lighting. All these examples are too many to count. All Hitchcock movies need extreme examining to catch his masterful talent, but the irony of the shots is a great detail. The detective is so used to watching people from afar, yet he looses consciousness if he looks down from a tall height. This can also sybolize the distance of true love and the depth of the human mind.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this movie pretty scary is that it deals with a psychological obsession with is too real which real people suffer from and get hurt by. But that's what makes this movie so brilliant. It pushed the boundaries of stories which the cinema presented and sucker punched it's audience. This movie is definitely a pleasant surprise and a must watch.",

Ever since it's release fifty two years ago it has wowed it's audience members and after seeing it for the first time I'm glad to say that it hasn't worn away with time but has instead stayed preserved and continues to show in the same way it did half a century ago. \r\nThe story follows John Ferguson played to the full by the always superb James Stewart, a private detective hired to follow his boss' suicidal bride, a woman named Madeline played by Kim Novak who is so naturally beautiful that Ferguson immediately falls madly in love with her. But as the intamcy grows between these two the plot thickens and twists to break all codes and conventions of movies of the 50's.\r\nThe performances by both the lead actors are extroadinary with James Stewart in one of his career bests. He doesn't just play his role, he lives it and shows all of his pain and heartbreak as he goes through this mad journey. His obsession with the woman he loves and his inability to finally let go not only shows the great character that was created by the screen writers but also shows Stewart's true colours as an actor, from this role he plays it is clear to the audience that he is capable of playing a man with such emotional passion. We always knew he was a good actor but Vertigo prooves him a great one.\r\nKim Novak is also very impressive in the film. It's challenging of course to play two different roles in the same movie without crossing over the two but Novak succeeds this quite easily due to her amazing acting talent. Though I've mentioned it a lot in this review it is the acting that makes the film. These two characters are so complex with Stewart having a great fear of hights and Novak having the urge and pleasure of causing her own destruction this makes Vertigo a very perculiar film but by no means a bad one, on the contrary in fact it makes a great one.\r\nHitchcock's best? It's possible but either way Vertigo is complex, heartbraking and overall touching to it's audience.",

I loved my experience watching \"Vertigo\", it just felt like it took a bit too long to get to the point. From the screenplay to the acting, the overall atmosphere of this film screams brilliance. It's not the type of film to watch over and over again. But it is surely a film that can be recommended over and over again to those who have not yet seen it. It is not at the top of Hitchcock's masterpieces, but it tries very hard to get there. \"Vertigo\" is surreal at times, and I loved it for that!",

            "content": "8.7/10\r\n\r\n     \u0093Vertigo\u0094 is most definitely the best film about acrophobia ever made. You can center your plot on the fear itself or even place the infamous phobia as the film\u0092s villain. But I\u0092ll tell you what. You will NEVER get close to matching \u0093Vertigo\u0094 in overall perfection and grace. This is an intellectually masterful film that\u0092s full of surprises. From unique visuals to wonderful performances, this film is without question flawless. It\u0092s got style, romance, drama, mystery, and the unbeatable suspense that only Alfred Hitchcock can deliver. Not only is it a great mystery, but it challenges the mind in ways that I will never truly know. Watching \u0093Vertigo\u0094 may as well be the cinematic equivalent to the very feeling of an acid trip (although one which you can control). At times, things can be visually sublime in appearance, although it\u0092s steady and always under control none the less. Hitchcock didn\u0092t write this beauty, although whoever did should by all means be proud. The style of narrative is so complex and rich that it may not appeal to those of this current generation. The world is no longer ready for films such as this, and therefore only true film buffs can remember the greatness that is a Hitchcock film. With that being said, I can only recommend \u0093Vertigo\u0094 to those who enjoy thinking and the philosophy of a film. Those with simple minds will be bored as hell with this one, so therefore it may not appeal to everyone\u0092s liking. But believe me when I say that it\u0092s a piece of art, and nobody can deny that. And if someone does, then they are being pretentious and obviously confused. Like I said, the world is no longer ready for films with such content as this one. Cinema has become rather commonly simplistic nowadays, and \u0093Vertigo\u0094 reminds me that there were once many, many geniuses working in the film industry. There are indeed some still working today, but back then there was more. And Hitchcock was the one to influence a generation of filmmakers. And if you watch ANY mystery of the modern generation, you\u0092ll notice a little Hitchcock in every one.\r\n\r\n              John \u0093Scottie\u0094 Ferguson is an acrophobic retired police officer. He often visits his friend Midge, who provides her communication services in an attempt to make John a tad happier. So one day, an old friend from college asks John to work as a private investigator that will follow his wife and study her recently strange behavior. John accepts after a bit of persuasion, but proceeds with caution. He develops feelings for the man\u0092s wife (who\u0092s name is Madeline), although looses her all too easily. He rescues her from drowning in the bay and takes her in to his home, only to have her commit suicide by jumping off the local church roof. Heartbroken and full of anxiety, John decides to lay low for a while. Sadly, he\u0092s having a lot of trouble forgetting his dear Madeline, and ultimately begins to feel as if he\u0092s seeing her everywhere. Well, it is as they say: We see what we want to see. But one day, he meets her again mysteriously. This new girl bears the name of Judy, and John starts to develop strong romantic feelings for her as well. Since I don\u0092t want to spoil the twists and surprises in store, I\u0092m not going to go any further. While it may seem simplistic at first, \u0093Vertigo\u0094 never fails to develop into something that is ultimately complex in the end. It is an unforgettable and incredibly well written story full of endearing characters and surprising scenarios. Perhaps this film did not put Mr. Hitchcock on the map (for he was already on it), but it inspired a generation of mystery films to come. And that\u0092s good enough for me.\r\n\r\n          James \u0093Jimmy\u0094 Stewart puts on yet again a stellar and unforgettable performance. Everything he does (from the way he talks to the way he walks) is so perfect and endearing. His character is always interesting and as an actor he\u0092s just plain unpredictable. It\u0092s a shame that there\u0092s no \u0093Jimmy Stewart\u0094 for the Facebook generation. Sure, we have a crap load of great actors, but what the hell. You simply cannot replace ol\u0092 Jimmy. Kim Novak is also pitch perfect and rather unpredictable in her role, although not as much as Mr. Stewart. No other man (or woman) in this film can match the awesomeness that he ultimately delivers. Otherwise, a colorful supporting cast also helps these two awesome stars carry the fire until it burns to a coal.\r\n\r\n                I must be perfectly clear if I am to tell you just what kind of film \u0093Vertigo\u0094 is. It\u0092s a mystery film that is surprisingly complex and has more than its share of surprises. It is meant to shock you with its twist and dazzle you with its visual style. This is indeed a visually impressive achievement from Hitchcock. It\u0092s in color, for Christ sake. And it has dazzling cinematography as well. The camera angles are just right, and for the time the texturing was amazing. Now, it\u0092s not AS dazzling, but it still looks great none the less. I mean, come on. It\u0092s \u0093Vertigo\u0094. The film also makes use of imaginative imagery through dream sequences and the like. These scenes are rare, but in that sense they are treats. The film\u0092s soundtrack is as awesome as you\u0092d hope for it to be, although it would have been perfect only if it were more psychological. None the less, this is an artistic film all around. And it fits the genre quite perfectly. This is indeed a mystery film, and a damn good one by all means. There are not many mystery films that can match an experience as powerful and forceful as this one here. Perhaps it will not be entertaining to everyone, but to most film fanatics it will be fascinating. Nevertheless, I love it because it is an achievement in film and is truly intelligent on all accounts. \r\n\r\n          The meaning of the word \u0093vertigo\u0094 is said to be a certain dizziness of some sort. I guess the film\u0092s title refers ultimately to the acrophobia of its main character. I find it to be revolutionary none the less. This really is a beautiful film, and I may watch it again. Not because I need to, but because I simply want to experience it all once more before I forget all about it. Chances are, I\u0092ll purchase a copy of it and remember it forevermore. You can count on that. So if you have yet to see \u0093Vertigo\u0094, then I suggest you make it a top priority. It is an event in filmmaking even if it does not rank among my absolute favorites. I love it nevertheless. Who says you can\u0092t love something without it being your favorite, am I right? Is it a crime to love a piece of art as it is? No, it isn\u0092t. Film lovers rejoice. Hitchcock has again made a movie for all of us. All of us accept for non-film lovers. They\u0092ll probably be bored within the first ten minutes of apparently \u0093dated\u0094 Technicolor. But whatever. I could care less. This is a great film and nobody should deny it. It\u0092s simply a matter of personal preference. That\u0092s damn right, my friends. Damn right.",

The realisation is revealed much before the ending and so in effect, the last part of the movie is almost like a different movie where we begin questioning not Novak's character but what Scottie is planning. Some of the plotlines and scenes may seem a little far-fetched, such as Scottie overcoming his vertigo so easily at the end, and the exquisite plan for Elster to get a witness for the suicide. Whether this makes it believable as a movie is questionable but it sure does leave the viewer curious and shocked at the revelations.",

With chilling music, brilliant acting, and an incredible plot, this is potentially Hitchcock's best film. An incredibly simple plot, turns incredibly complicated in a true Hitchcock manner, and the whole film is intricately tied together with a steady pace. James Stewart assumes his role perfectly, and the first half of the film is particularly gripping. It takes a different turn towards the end, as he tries to recreate his lover, but Hitchcock manages to keep us engaged and connected. The inclusion of Scottie's acrophobia is interesting, and plays a vital part in the events that surround the mystery. A brilliant film, with all the ingredients of a true Hitchcock classic. He is a master of story-telling, and this is perhaps his finest creation.",

My only issue with Vertigo is that, upon rewatching it for the first time in years, I found it interminably slow in parts. But its pacing is not necessarily plodding as much as it methodical, for Hitchcock sculpts each mise-en-scene perfectly and compulsively and its seemingly slow meandering serves the overall purpose of the film which is a direct experience of time, of the time it takes for an obsession to be built, of the time it takes to generate the memories that will linger and alter the fabric of our lives to come. Novak and Stewart are phenomenal, and Hitchcock creates some his most memorable effects in this film: his zoom-track to simulate the feeling of vertigo, his arcing around Stewart and Novak as images of the past swirl behind them, and his kaleidoscopic spirals to invoke Scottie's (Stewart's) deteriorating mental state. All in all, a picture of master artist at work in an unforgettable film.",

            "content": "One of the better known Hitchcock films; it has a long and strenuous history as well as a legacy unlike many of his other films. In part this is probably because Hitchcock made this film very personal, and made it his mission to indelibly link it to himself. The film is based on a book by two of his favorite writers, it takes on a psychological problem among scores of real people, and it has a great twist that makes it iconic. Unlike some of Hitchcock's previous films, this one takes a decidedly mature look at murder. Not that films such as \"Rear Window\" and \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" didn't seem devilish, but there's something so methodically torturous about the psyche of the main character that it makes it stand out from his previous films. \"Psycho\" would be the only true rival to this film, though this one feels more like a passion project than the former. When this film was initially released it didn't do well with box office figures and certainly not with the critics. Most of the criticism attributed to this film has to do with the choice in cast. James Stewart was a powerful and interesting collaborator with Hitchcock throughout both of their careers, but at the time he was pushing fifty and having a 24 year old love interest (Novak) as the femme fatale seemed a little too overboard for most audiences. This doesn't really bother you as the viewer though, because the character of Judy seems too needy and unloved, so that Scottie's (Stewart) admiration for her only shows her true colors. Scottie loving Madeleine only shows her inherent beauty and youth. Scottie's vertigo isn't used in every juncture of the film, but it is used as a pivotal piece of the plot, and remains one of the better Hitchcockian twists in any film. Everything about this film feels a bit off, mostly because it is dealing with the subject of vertigo, and the strange fascination of two identical people fooling another all for the means of a fiend. Hitchcock is marvelous, and it really pains me to know that this film, sometimes said to be the best film of all time, was reviled when it came out.",

Instead of aiming for pure visceral thrills i.e. Psycho or political thriller and nature of innocence i.e. North by Northwest Alfred is interested in tackling the more interesting themes of love, obsession, and death. The mystery plot serves Hitchcock's ideas rather than vice versa, as in his other works. But despite an appropriately haunted performance from James Stewart, and haunting one from Kim Novak, something just does not click. I think Hitchcock is so accustomed to breakneck pace that when attempting to slow it down he cannot hold interest quite so well. The film does however boast one of the most impressive closing sequences in cinema, one that has doubtless been the template for countless mind-bending thrillers, from Memento to the Usual Suspects. Despite being a slightly flawed entry into the Hitchcock Canon Vertigo  is still devilishly intriguing and well worth watching.",

Vertigo: \"A haunting tale of deception, madness, and death--a masterful exploration of fantasy and anxiety.\" Oh, but it is quite the contrary! There is nothing haunting about Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', nothing mad. Perhaps it is the test-of-time that haunts this film so, or perhaps my expectations where cast too high, that a fall as hard as mine was a mere inevitability. Or perhaps I have read the pages of too many novels to find the storytelling here nothing more than uninteresting.\n\nI have always been a fan of James Stewart ever since 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington', but his role as John Ferguson, Scottie, felt as if it were, as the film progressed, careless. The best performance here isn't from James Stewart, but rather the city of San Francisco, its streets and its architecture.\n\nOverall I thought the film was good and it has its charms, a style, but for me to think it a masterpiece, oh, I cannot.

I wasn't really sure what to expect from this film but what i found was a total dissapointment. As the film is based on a book i can only assume that huge swaths had to be cut out of the script to condence it for, a still not short, running time of 2 hours. Fine actor that James Stewart is the script does him no favours and its utterly unconvincing that someone would fall so obsesively in love with a woman that he has only spent one evening with or that she in turn would recipricate to the same degree. This failing at once undermines the whole core of the film and leaves Stewarts character looking like some bizare looney stalker.

From reading other critiques on the film, apparently Vertigo is interpreted as a very personal film of Hitchcocks and reflective of his mental state working on other features.

With good reason, mind you, but it's totally creepy to see someone as square as your next door neighbor Mr. Filbert turn into the guy that tried to kill Bjork.\n\nTo put it in film terms that everyone would be familiar with: imagine if the befuddled Hugh Grant played the guy that wore the pokey strap-on in Seven.  \"Oh, I'm terribly sorry.....I mean, you see, the thing is, well....how do I put this in such a delicate manner.....unfortunately, I fucked her, you see?

Hitchcock's masterpiece actually reminds of everything that I love about Roman Polanski's work -- it's disturbing, twisted, emotional, daring, and, of course, related to identity and obsession. Jimmy Stewart and (especially) Kim Novak are fantastic in the leads, and the film just gets better with every second, leading up to it's dark and ambiguous ending.

While it lacks the humor of some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, and sometimes moves rather slowly, it is unforgettable, and a great achievement by the director and his cast.\nIf you have never seen it, you will enjoy it more if you do not know too much about the plot, although the actual story is somewhat secondary to the ways that the characters are tested and their weaknesses exposed by the various events. Hitchcock uses a complicated story, interesting characters, lavish visual detail, and deliberate pacing, plus a fine musical score by the incomparable Bernard Hermann, to produce a mysterious, almost unearthly, atmosphere. The tension rarely lets up, and the viewer is caught up completely in it, at times almost to the point of discomfort. It's the kind of film that repays careful attention, as almost every moment is filled with significant detail.\nThere are also some great acting performances. Jimmy Stewart is outstanding in a role far different from his usual screen persona. He enables the viewer to sympathize completely with him, even as we cringe at many of his character's actions and decisions. Kim Novak is completely convincing in a difficult dual role, and the movie would not have been as compelling without her fine performance. The rest of the cast all have much smaller roles, but are all quite good too, especially Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie's (Stewart's) old friend, who provides important insight into Scottie's character.\n\"Vertigo\" is a classic by any standard. It's a must-see that remains just as impressive with each viewing.",
