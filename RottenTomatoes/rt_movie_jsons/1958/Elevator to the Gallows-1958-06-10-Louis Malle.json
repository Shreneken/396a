    "summary": "Restless femme fatale Florence Carala (Jeanne Moreau) recruits her lover, Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet), to murder her wealthy husband, Simon (Jean Wall), in his office and make it appear like a suicide. Tavernier does the dirty deed eagerly, but becomes trapped in an elevator when he returns to remove a key piece of evidence he had accidentally left behind. Tavernier's unfortunate oversight sets into motion a dark ripple of events that bloodies the cold Paris night.",

            "content": "Just got out of that elevator after almost a full day, better grab a croissant. \n\nFeaturing a plot with more twists than a pretzel, Elevator to the Gallows is a story of compounding mistakes and ill intentions. None of the characters that suffer in this film are innocent, but we still end up not only invested heavily in the outcome despite plenty of guilt to go around, but relating to each of them individually. This film is like watching people play badminton with a grenade, and while there is a bit of a morbid fascination with seeing how the unpredictable events of the film will help spell out the fates of our pseudo-protagonists, director Louis Malle really shines with his understanding and depiction of emotion as characters recognize that they are being tossed around by circumstances beyond (or often, ironically within) their control. There's great views of midcentury Paris, including a beautiful shot of Jeanne Moreau walking half-stunned through busy traffic, eyes looking off in the distance, lost in speculation and worry. Tying it all together is the soundtrack from Miles Davis, literally composed to match the film as he and his group were watching it, resulting in a free-form jazz musical accompaniment that emulates the organic meandering of the plot and continues to receive praise. Pretty much convinced that Robert Bresson took this narrative as heavy inspiration for his own similarly-structured 1983 film, L'Argent. \n\nJust a reminder that Louis Malle was heavily involved with Jacques Cousteau's landmark documentary The Silent World, Bresson's timeless thriller A Man Escaped, and Elevator to the Gallows (his first feature debut) all before the age of 26. That's why everyone else should just give up. (4/5)",

That was pretty amateurish how he forgot to retrieve the rope and hook. I mean isn't he used to this kind of stuff? It seems like he was a part of some war and now works for a crooked war criminal. Now Florence thinks Julien ran off with some other girl. Omg I would freak the fuck out if I were stuck in an elevator. Props to him for keeping his cool. \n\nI love how beautifully Miles Davis' score compliments the movie. It sets a really cool and noir tone for the film. Real slick and sexy. The overall look of the film is very unique. There's a certain feeling of mysticism that Paris has at night in this movie that I haven't really seen portrayed in other movies. It's quite magical really. The lighting is used in very creative and fun ways. \n\nThose shots of Jeanne Moreau wandering around the streets at night looking for Julien while Miles Davis' score plays in the background was very sexy and mesmerizing to watch. It's so crazy how the photos in the camera held all the evidence needed in order to convict everyone rightfully. \n\nSoaked in atmosphere and coolness. This movies got plenty of style going for it. Really good storytelling, the way they pieced everything together and the way everything plays out. Unfortunately, I don't think I'd watch it again. I don't really love noir films.",

            "content": "There is a lot going on in Elevator to the Gallows, despite the fact that it all starts so simply. I loved the opening scene, and I was so intensely focused on it that I caught the mistake that leads to all the subsequent drama. I was truly fascinated to see the way that things kept spiraling further and further out of control as the film went on, and all because of that one minor misstep. The initial plan was so straightforward that I had to commend the main character on his idea. It’s just a shame that he failed to think on his toes when one thing went wrong. I think there are a few elements of the film that are a little outdated which took me a minute to understand, particularly with the technology. That being said, most of the movie worked as a thriller and kept me fully engaged because I was desperate to know what would happen and if the protagonist would get away with his crime. One of the biggest struggles I had with Elevator to the Gallows was the fact that almost every character we follow is a bad person. Even those who we never see committing a crime are at least complicit in the criminal activities. Not only that, but most of the characters make some stupid decisions. These are necessary things to keep the plot moving forward, but it bugs me when I see someone acting dumb for no good reason. Despite my struggle with the characters and their choices and motivations, the film as a whole still worked well for me. I liked how claustrophobic it felt for Maurice Ronet’s character, but I’m also glad we did not have to spend the entire duration of the movie trapped with him. Overall, Elevator to the Gallows was a satisfying experience. While I might prefer movies with more likable characters, it still had an exciting plot that kept me interested the entire time.",

Plenty of noir films involve a \"perfect murder\" that goes utterly wrong, but Elevator to the Gallows is unique thanks to tight camera work by Henri Decae, an expert pace from director Louis Malle, an atmosphere that anticipates French New Wave, a simmering performance from Jeanne Moreau, and a score from Miles Davis that ventures into the modal territory that the trumpeter would further explore with Kind of Blue.",

Florence (Moreau) and Julien (Ronet) are two lovers out of wedlock, the only barrier is Florence's senescent but wealthy husband Simon (Wall), for whom Julien works as a corporate clerk, they diligently hatch a plot to get rid of Simon and make the pretense as a suicide scene. The scheme is executed according to the schedule until a last-moment hiccup (Julien forgets the damn rope on the roof), a black cat is always ominous, just when he returns to the company building to fetch it, Julien is accidentally left alone in the elevator. Meanwhile, a pair of youngster Louis and Véronique (Poujouly and Bertin) lift Julien's posh car for a wild ride, en route, a harebrained Louis shot a German couple in a motel using the identity of Julien. The same night, Florence is aimlessly roaming around the streets of Paris, looking for her absent lover! \n\nThings will get messier the next morning when Julien gets out of the elevator, he is wanted by the police and Florence starts to get a grip on the entire misidentified situation, after a concise confrontation with Louis and Véronique, a few developed photographs reveal the real culprits of both homicides, the star-crossed lovers meet their comeuppance as well as the hotheaded Louis.\n\nLogically speaking, its 88 minutes running time seems a bit sketchy for clarifying the police's investigation procedure and there are a flew negligible plot holes dangling (e.g. how the rope without a trace appears at the entrance of the building is never explained), obviously they are not Malle's first choice. The picture is mostly preeminent for the bounteous close-ups to examine his then lover Moreau's emotive visage (under a plain make-up free naturalism) with her inner voice-over, equally impressively is the Black & White shots of the night view on the expressway and in the interrogation part under a pitch-black background, it is a conflation of Film-Noir with a budding La Nouvelle Vague. My personal recommendation is a heart-in-the-mouth set piece for the acrophobic when Julien tries to scale down from the elevator when it abruptly descends, Ronet is solely in his prime and later his mojo would be evoked unconditionally in Malle's THE FIRE WITHIN (1963, 9/10). Two thumbs up to Malle for his immense dexterity in such an incipient stage of his career.  \n\nOne can also find some scattered fun in the film, such as the chic vehicle or the gizmos of a spy camera or the telephone-cum-pencil-sharpener, certainly for me they are eye-openers. Let's not forget Miles Davis' saxophone-heavy score, downright impromptu, but tallies with the film impeccably!  \n\nA more on-topic note is the alert message \"never leave photos around\", if only everyone could have watched this film before we reached this epoch of selfie fever, the world would be a bit less tumultuous indeed.",

That leads to me scanning through the criterion collection on Hulu and finding movies like Malle's Elevator to the Gallows (1958). Fans of Hitchcock on and movies like Diabolique (1955) will find a lot to enjoy with this one.\n\nMaurice Ronet plays Julien Tavernier a retired military man who is in love with his bosses wife. The two of them come up with a fool proof plan to kill the boss and make it look like a suicide. On a Saturday near closing time, when the building is empty, Julien slips out his window uses a small grappling hook to climb up the side of the building and sneaks into his bosses office. Julien shoots his boss and then plants the gun in his hand. Then he escapes back down the rope and back into his own office. Confident he has pulled off the perfect crime, Julien follows his fellow employees out of the building ready to go spend the rest of the weekend with bosses wife (Jeanne Moreau). Right before he drives off, Julien looks up and notices that he has left the rope dangling from the side of the building. Cursing he foolishness, Julien re-enters the building to go and retrieve the rope. As he is riding the elevator back up, the porter turns off the power in the building and traps Julien in the elevator. What follows is a series of mistaken identities and bad decisions that will lead to dire consequences for everyone involved.\n\nTo check out our full review head on over to 3guys1movie.com",

While it was unique, following two criminal couples with baggage in France, it wasn't particularly good. For one everything felt to coincidental, everything happened at the wrong time, or right time depending on how you viewed the film. I was viewing it rooting against the protagonists. All four of them, I was cheering for the police. Therefore the ending actually did bring some joy to me. I doubt this is how Malle intended to deliver the film though. I also felt like the female performances were amateur. The men did alright, but the woman didn't seem convincing at all. I feel like my rating is a tad rough, but honestly I didn't catch the hype. I'm not saying it's overrated, just not of value to me. I will say though, some scenes looked gorgeous.",

With its soothing soundtrack performed by Louie Armstrong, and with its elegant cinematography made by Henri DecaÃ«, Elevator to the Gallows flows wonderfully as a very successful neo noir. It has a distressing claustrophobic feel given by the intertwining elevator scenes, where the leading man got trapped after he committed a murder. Moreover, there is a devilish femme fatale strolling around the beautiful nightly Paris looking for her lover, and two reckless youngsters, who unintentionally drag themselves into the whole intrigue. Although the theme is classic, it doesn't seem derivative and looks surprisingly fresh in the French surroundings.",

            "content": "Ancora piuttosto giovincello (venticinque anni!!) Louis Malle scrive e dirige un noir di culto del cinema thriller che diventerà presto una pietra miliare della Nouvelle Vague; \"Ascenseur pour l'échafaud\" è la storia di un ufficiale veterano della legione che operò in Indochina ed in Algeria, il quale decide di uccidere il suo capo durante la fine dell'orario di lavoro, così da poter scappare con la moglie dell'industriale, con cui aveva iniziato un rapporto morbosamente passionale. Durante la fuga dall'edificio però qualcosa va storto e il protagonista rimane intrappolato in ascensore. Nel frattempo due giovani ventenni gli rubano la lussuosa automobile per una notte di eccessi, ma anche per loro il destino riserverà degli imprevisti grotteschi: Malle, grazie ad una tecnica sui generis di indubitabile grazia, tinge di giallo e di nero una trama solida ed accattivante, in cui l'alchimia tra i due caratteristi centrali (Florence Carala e Julien Tavernier) funziona perfettamente, nonostante entrambi, in tutto il film, si vedano insieme solo in delle foto che verranno esposte quando la polizia riuscirà finalmente a farsi un quadro preciso della situazione. La fotografia (chiaro riferimento metacinematografico) è la demodulazione della verità, capace di impressionare in quei piccoli istanti di vita, il profilo e le sorti dei due amanti, le cui vite, proprio a causa d'essa, verranno inchiodate e condannate dalle autorità. Non sembrerebbe altrettanto efficace però la caratterizzazione dei due giovanissimi \"ladri\", che nei risvolti finali danno esattamente la sensazione di essere due perfetti idioti, come d'altronde enuncia Florence nel momento in cui il soggetto comincerà ad avviarsi verso l'epilogo. Difettuccio non indifferente visto che dovrebbero rappresentare loro, senza ombra di dubbio, quel temperamento ribelle che diede origine a questa \"nuova onda\" della settima arte, varata dallo stesso Malle e gli altri registi del famoso movimento francese. Piccole imperfezioni a parte, \"Ascensore per il patibolo\" rimane comunque un cult.",

The cool protagonist and a seductive blonde as his partner, accompanied by a classy score, this is a film that epitomizes the French noir films of it's time. The one problem I had was when Louis cannot steal the German's Mercedes because the German hid something the first gear of the gearbox. After Louis kills him, he manages to drive away in the Mercedes without adjusting any gearbox or anything; it wasn't a huge deal but it was confusing. Although there is quite a break from convention, the ending does not manage to tie up all the loose ends in a completely logical and realistic manner. Malle does cover his tracks and there is not any inconsistency in the ending, however, it seemed a bit out of place with the rest of the film.",

As in any good noir, we're rooting for characters who are duplicitous murderers.  And we want them to get away with it.  I absolutely loved this film.

            "content": "The doomed lovers of 1958's \"Elevator to the Gallows\" do not find their erotic passion lost in a smoke of underlying deception.  Their erotic passion is cloaked in the love Walter Neff dreamed of: quivering, gauzy, potent.  But it's obstructed by the presence of an unwanted husband, a husband perhaps too sensitive, too vengeful, to simply divorce.  Murder, it seems, is the only way to live happily ever after, even if all roads end in a blazing afterlife.\n\tThe lovers are Julien (Maurice Ronet) and Florence (Jeanne Moreau), her husband powerful business magnate Simon Carala (Jean Well).  She married young, putting comfort ahead of adoration; Julien, incidentally, resides under her husband's employment.  They aren't planning to off the man for his money - they figure the publicity, the ruthlessness of her husband would be catastrophic in their relationship.  So they come up with a foolproof plan: while Florence waits around in a chic Parisian café, Julien, pretending to go back up to his office for a few after hour tasks, will instead climb up to Carala's work space, shoot him point blank, and stage it as if it were a suicide.\n\tIt is the perfect murder, and is, for the most part, carried out with finesse only paralleled by the most experienced of assassins.  After the deed is done and the suspicions of his coworkers go untouched, Julien treads back to his convertible as if nothing is off, cool as a cucumber.  But just as his foot steps on the gas, he notices that the grapple hook he used to climb into Carala's office remains.  Though it's bound to eventually fall and go unnoticed by investigators, Julien's paranoia manages to seep into his common sense - so he decides to barge back into the building at the last moment, figuring that taking a chance poses too many risks.  But as he takes the elevator back up to his office, the very worst possible scenario becomes a reality when the security guard shuts off the electricity and leaves our sympathetic killer trapped in the confines of the shaft.  \n\tFlorence waits for what feels like days, wandering around the city while hiding her internal despair, letting rain pour onto her poreless facsimile as she gives numb face to the empty chill of the night.  Did the lover she once trusted betray her?\n\t\"Elevator to the Gallows\", the directorial debut of Louis Malle, is a mood piece years ahead of its time, its Miles Davis scored, glacial black-and-white assimilating it into something nearly futuristic in its slippery minimalism.  It's film noir at its most downbeat, its most bewitching; the midnight streets of the city are seductively \"The Third Man\", and the murder is an act of love tattered by true affection rather than the artificial sort of \"Double Indemnity\".  \"Elevator to the Gallows\" is so elegantly dangerous because it's the kind of film where everything goes wrong; perfection is cheap.  It's the alarm of an unexpected deviation that beguiles.  \n\tThe central romance between Julien and Florence diffuses a sort of efficacy only found in the love stories of forgotten classics - their devotion to one another makes the stake riddled surroundings all the more agonizing because we want them to end up together.  Their crime is not a part of a double-cross or a scheme; it's an act of despondency fueled by desire.  The side-plot, which focuses on the attractive teenage couple (Georges Poujouly, Yori Bertin) that steals Julien's car, commits murder, attempts suicide, and gets him framed, is so gripping only because it so eccentrically reflects the plight of the main anti-heroes.  While the latter couple plans everything methodically yet doesn't get away with it, the former acts on haphazard instinct and glides by with ludicrous success.  It's an irony Malle sees through with an utmost tragic eye.\n\tBut \"Elevator to the Gallows\" is stylish, sophisticated entertainment meant to bridge the gap between thriller style and the heaviness of crime and its side effects.  In the end, our eyes are more pleased than our intellectual pangs (it's much more captivating to gaze upon Moreau's masterfully understated performance than consider the reality of it all), but \"Elevator to the Gallows\" is a noir less 1958 and more timeless - its efficiency has not aged.",
