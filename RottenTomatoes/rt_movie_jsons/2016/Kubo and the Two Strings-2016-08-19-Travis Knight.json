            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD. \nWhat an absolute gem of a film! Travis Knight did an absolutely phenomenal job on this film, this was my first film I watched by the Laika company, and my god I loved this. The story is about a young boy, a monkey and a beetle on an epic journey to find Kubo's fathers armour set. They have to find a sword, breastplate and a helmet to be able to defeat Kubo's grandfather who is after his second eye, his grandfather previously taking his first eye when he was young. \n\nOverall, without spoiling too much, the plot, story and narrative all fit together perfectly in my opinion, I never once got lost or confused as to what was happening whilst watching. It's emotional at points and it makes you feel happy, sad, angry and every other emotion all at different points.\n\nKubo & The Two Strings is also a very pretty and good looking film, The cinematography and overall look of the film & animation is very beautiful. It has a distinct look about it, and I believe the aesthetic of the film fits perfectly. Finally, the colours are magnificent, the way the film uses colour is great, with lots of shades of red, orange, yellow etc to create a beautiful landscape.\n\nFinally, the music is one of the best features of the film, the use of Japanese styled music really makes it shine, the music really sets the tone of the film and the added bonus of a magnificent cover of While My Guitar Gently Weeps (George Harrison) by Regina Spektor makes the soundtrack even better, I loved the music and the style of music just as much as the film itself! \n\nAlthough the whole film was great, I did find myself calling what was going to happen way before it actually happened, but this was a minor thing, and it didn't spoil the experience for me. \n\nIn conclusion, this has got to be one of the best animated films I have seen in a little while. I would 100% recommend that you buy the Blu-Ray and witness the beauty within. And I hope that you love it as much as I and thousands more people do. \n5/5",

He could already visit Kubo on earth if he wanted to meet him.\nAlso Kubo brought his grandfather back to life, so he could have just brought his grandfather back to life all this time, no need for Kubo to go to heaven, when his grandfather can come back to earth or back to life.\n\nThe magic sword sliced the moon king open, but nothing happened.\nThe magic helmet was taken off without effort. And you could hear Kubo's bones being cracked through the magic breast plate.\nTherefore all the magic weapons were completely useless.\n\nAfter the evil moon king destroyed the village he is defeated and all of a sudden he is alive again and the entire village loves him and lies to him.\n\nThe ending is sad. In the end Kubo loses his parents twice, he is still missing an eye, he lost his aunts too and his grandfather lost his memories.\n\nNothing was gained. Except an ending to the story. Pretty lame.",

            "content": "A breathtaking journey into friendship and self convictions.\n\nTravis Knight directs Laika's stop motion animated fantasy adventure Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) with a striking patience for the melancholic, quiet moments in life as well as a spirited warmth for Kubo's odyssey through the hero's journey. Knight takes you on an emotional voyage with Kubo as you appreciate the themes of motherhood, friendship, morals, community, spirituality, and trust. Writers Chris Butler, Marc Haimes, and Shannon Tindle craft Kubo's understanding of these concepts on a deeper level as he uncovers his mysterious past. Kubo and the Two Strings is animation studio Laika's most emotionally sensitive film with a mature tone and playful childlike wonder for the world around Kubo.\n\nI love August Hall and Alice Bird's art direction for Kubo and the Two Strings. Making a Japanese folk story into a blend of Japanese aesthetic and culture with Laika's gorgeous stop motion animation is very creative. I love the way the waves feel layered like the leaf stitched sail or the flashes of swords clashing. Kubo must have been a pain to create with such detailed stop motion work. Editor Christopher Murrie splices all this footage together with a steady pace for a brisk 102 minute adventure for any family.\n\nArt Parkinson's sincere and sweet voice works well for Kubo, with his ability to sound concerned and empathetic to all around him. Meanwhile, Charlize Theron kills it as the tough love Monkey and tenderly earnest Mother voices. Brenda Vaccaro is funny as the elderly lady Kameyo. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and George Takei's villagers are funny like Matthew McConaughey's hilarious Beetle character that I loved tremendously. Matthew gives Beetle a whimsical nature that is laid back and works so well for his memory loss suffering samurai. Rooney Mara is incredible with her dual role as the eerie Sisters. Ralph Fiennes gets to deliver excellent and unsettling speeches to perfection as The Moon King.\n\nVisually, Kubo and the Two Strings is Laika's most refined picture with Frank Passingham's cinematography looks gorgeous with these ultra wide shots of Kubo's rich environments guiding the film, to his more tender close-up shots of these animated characters to really see their personality and emotions. The animators line up Kubo's string playing with the music and his hands fretting the lute's neck, down to the finger movements. Kubo is certainly impressive.\n\nProduction designers Nelson Lowry and Daniel R. Casey finds a natural textured look for Kubo's village and all the forests and temples look amazing. Carl B. Hamilton and Andy Berry's set decoration has all these cute figures and furnishings in the homes to look more realistic. All the paper scrolls and bowls look so cute. The visual effects for the magic spells of the witch to the swirling paper magic of Kubo's musical numbers are wondrous. \n\nComposer Dario Marianelli did a fantastic job spiraling emotional melodies with exciting adventure themes through Kubo and the Two Strings. I appreciate Marianelli's varied musical stylings that have a Japanese sound to the themes, while also feeling especially cinematic. Deborah Cook's costumes look so neat for Kubo's robes to Beetle's shell armor and The Sisters' black cloaked outfits.\n\nIn all, Kubo and the Two Strings is one of Laika's best stop motion films with a resplendent humanity and sense of self. It has charm and identity that all feel unique.",

            "content": "This may be one of the worst written movies I have ever witnessed, it has bad characters, backstory and logic.\n\nWarning: This review goes into detail about the movies plot, characters and scenes. You may thanks me later.\n\nLets say you have a plot that hinges around a backstory that won't be told for some time, imagine that backstory being two people fight, the guy calls the evil girl hot, so she stops being evil, because that's what this story is about. Evil Father doesn't like this, so he takes his grandson's eye (Attempted to take both) so he doesn't succumb to the same fate, which doesn't make much sense since it was words that turned his daughter, but whatever.\n\nNow our story starts and the once evil Mother is escaping on a raft, using her magic powers to cut through waves, she hits her head on a rock and gets brain damage. Fast forward ten or so years into the future and now our protagonist Kubo is helping out his Mother and doing street performing with his own paper moving magic, telling the story of his brave Father which he hears from his Mother when she isn't been a cabbage. Anyway fast forward to the next day and Kubo is at a festival celebrating the dead. He tries contacting his Father, but he never shows up, which is the only good foreshadowing this story has. Kubo stays outside too long and since he can be found at night by his family, his aunts show up and menacingly act the same way as each other towards him. The village gets destroyed (No one dies despite being attacked by two demons) and Kubo's Mother sacrifices herself for the first time so that he can get away...with his clothing wings that he will never use again.\n\nThe story continues with him trying to find three magical items his Dad wielded in order to kill the rest of his family. It's never explained why these three items are not all together or how certain characters are what they currently are at given points, all you get is either magic or cursed. Sometimes Kubo's power (Which is to control paper) is used to move leaves, wood, creating a shield and turning an immortal god into a confused old man.\n\nEvery time danger is presented, the movie will go out of it's way to tell you what is going to happen. Don't go outside at night, next scene will be going out at night. There is a monster underwater that will keep you down there, better believe we're about to see that.\n\nKubo has a habit of caring about his dead Mother only when bought up, otherwise he seems pretty indifferent. The day after his mother's death, he is playing around with a scared bird, sending an army of paper birds with malicious intent, grinning all the while. When asked what he did before starting his quest he would say generic things like skipping stones and catching fireflies, which is fine to flesh out more about this character, I personally am impressed about how he managed to catch fireflies during the day, since he couldn't be out at night.\n\nSo moving onto our other main characters, we have a sentient piece of paper that acts as a silent representation of Kubo's Father, a monkey and a beetle man, beetle man is comic relief and the monkey is a straight man. I find the paper to be the most interesting character, I like how he points to the magical mcguffins since other characters have no clue where to go, which in itself doesn't matter since besides the last item, they are found on accident. The items themselves also don't really matter, the sword is the most important one of them all as it has a function and is used in every action sequence after acquiring it. However Kubo learns the power is within him and not his Father's relics, so he uses powers he didn't have prior to defeat his grandfather, who I might add just shows up after he gets the last item needed in the village that he starts at, guess grandfather got bored after his whole family died besides Kubo.\n\nSo that's basically the movie, can't really say I enjoyed anything besides the visuals, which were nice, good stop motion animation, only thing good about all of this. \n\nI hope you have a good day and avoid this movie unless you are incredibly curious.",

They did a lovely job of blending stop motion animation with some digital effects in order to give it an awesome look. Normally, there’s something about stop motion that I don’t typically like all that much, even though I recognize the complexity of the craft. However, Laika has top-tier stop motion, and this film is their best yet. It loses all of the herky-jerky motions, and looks fluid and realistic, almost as if it was entirely animated in a computer. I also like all the colors and the lighting in the film. It is a feast for the eyes, and I can see why I’ve heard so many people praise Kubo and the Two Strings. The voice cast is solid, although surprisingly white. Considering the type of story being told, and the general appearance of the characters, it certainly doesn’t look like a film that would star people like Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, and Ralph Fiennes. I did like a lot of the story structure in Kubo and the Two Strings. It has a fun quest vibe, and the risk always seems higher when your lead character is a young child. I liked how he interacted with the surrogate parents he met along the way, and those moments when they start connecting like a real family were hilarious and heartwarming. I struggled at times with the way Kubo’s magic worked. There didn’t seem to be a clear set of rules or logic to it, which is a pet peeve of mine. Perhaps the biggest flaw, though, was the end of the film. It’s ironic that Kubo is established as a character who struggles to finish his stories, because that almost feels like the screenwriter’s tipping their hand that they also couldn’t figure out how to reach a satisfying conclusion for the script. The final scenes of the film work enough that I wouldn’t say the movie is broken, it just lacked the kind of rewarding climax that it felt like everything was building towards. Kubo and the Two Strings is an extremely well-made film, and one I wish was just a touch better in the story points, because that could make it a favorite for me.",

            "content": "The raving fans of this movie have been caught up in the quality of the animation, failing to notice the rather deflated plot.\n\nFirst, this movie is not for children. The entire premise is that the celestial Moon King, a Sky Dragon, has already ripped out the eye of a baby, and desperately wants to rip out his other eye as a child. And it's his grandfather. This kind of familial violence was often seen in the original Hans Christian Anderson Tales, the Brothers Grimm, Green Willow, and other early works. None of them are for modern children's tastes. Every single scene involving that most unfortunate branch of the family is all about how they want to tear out his one remaining eye, ostensibly so that he would no longer notice anything redeeming about humanity. \n\nAnd herein we find the first plot hole. If tearing out his eye would render him blind like the Moon King's family, then how did his mother see the goodness in his father? Her eyes looked human throughout the movie, which leads one to believe that somehow the eyes can regain a corporeal nature...which makes tearing his out pointless. His grandfather had clouded eyes, yet could see perfectly. The mythology seems to be that he is blind to humanity's good, but the eyes could still see. If Kubo had both his eyes torn out, one would assume that they would stay missing. He would not have cloudy eyes to get around with perfectly, but rather would just be blind. There doesn't seem to be any magical spell that would change him, so one would assume he would still like humans, and his mutilation would be totally pointless. \n\nHis mother went from one extreme, drowning in depression, leaving her child to feed both of them all day, to fierce warrior protector. After all the trouble she went to saving her child from her father, she went catatonic for years, apparently, regressing daily. Yet, somehow, the imminent threat of him being blinded gave her the gumption to snap out of it. There was no believable plot device for why someone so powerful would succumb to catatonic depression, only to magically snap out of it when she took another form. \n\nKubo also seemed curiously obtuse as to not recognize his mother's voice in the body of Monkey. And she was similarly oblivious not to notice the voice of the love of her life, the man she gave up the Heavens for, in the body of Beatle. For otherwise bright and resourceful people, this was the plot device equivalent of a super hero putting on a thin mask that only covered his eyes, and no one was able to recognize him. \n\nThe giant eyes on the underwater stalks were a missed opportunity, as the director never indicted what power they had over him. Were they showing him his wildest dreams? Making him think he was above the water? Or was it just look-into-my-eye hypnosis?\n\nThe ejection of both of his parents were like blunt force trauma to the script. They realized his father was beetle, who swore to dying Monkey to protect him for the rest of his life, which was about 30 seconds. A Samurai would not turn his back on his enemy. \n\n The ending was both melodramatic and abrupt. Kubo's power of the Armor enabled him to not only shock his grandfather out of his celestial dragon form, but also transfer his missing left eye to him, or alternatively knocked the cloud off his left eye, enabling him to suddenly become a really nice old man with total memory loss. The entire town joins Kubo in lying to him, claiming he was the nicest man for miles, because, realistically, if he knew himself everyone would die. Strange. His mother did not get total memory loss when she gained the sight of compassion. \n\nWhy wouldn't Kubo have restored his own left eye? Typically, when someone spends your entire life trying to blind you, succeeding 50%, causes the death of both of your parents, destroys your village...you don't make a pet out of him. There's forgiveness, and then there is stupidity. The only reason why he appears to be nice, is amnesia. \n\nIn the end, Kubo is orphaned, his village lies in ruin, but he has the orchestrator of his demise that he'll have to care for, as he did his catatonic mother. This was almost as depressing as Middle Eastern or Korean soap operas. \n\nThe animation and score were well done. There were some fantastic acting talents involved although, for an Asian theme, a marked lack of Asian voices. The Japanese culture was a very thin veneer. There were a couple of bowls of rice, some chop sticks, and a dragon dancer. Other than that, no cultural traditions for a story supposedly set...in Japan. \n\nOverall, the background research seemed thin, the plot was abrupt and relied on acting out of character, and the entire premise was depressing. Yes, it had fantastic stop motion animation, but a 5 star movie needs more than that.",

Frankly, it is a personal tale conveyed with nightmarish demonic path and powerful undefeated- in fact- swords and magic. As much as mythologically the tale thrives upon, it also doesn't overstays its welcome by dwelling utterly on the past. It keeps refreshing the equation through creating the new equations on screen that leaves a long lasting impression.\n\nAnother major contributing factor is humbleness that each of its three dimensional characters works on. Donating their last drop of sweat and blood for the greater good, each supporting character pushes the protagonist up till the hill. It runs on a linear and simpler track that every now and then is funny and action packed, which leaves you in an awe for its layered through provoking concept. Voice cast has managed to stick by their role convincingly. Theron as the overprotective mother or arguably the only guardian, is walking on new terms but is still a soothing compelling performer.\n\nChallenging her parallel-y lies McConaughey's completely opposite light hearted gullible brave warrior that keeps the bed warm and cozy.

This story is so gripping and emotional, with brilliant visual storytelling and facial expressions to show what the characters are thinking.\n\nAnd speaking of which, this rivals Aladdin and The Lion King as one of the most gorgeous animated films ever made. The tangibility of the stop-motion effects make it feel so real even though I'm looking at stop-motion. I fathom how some of these effects were done, like the water, mountains, this giant red skeleton, and even the combat sequences!\n\nZootopia was good, but no where near as memorable or emotionally impacting as Kubo and the Two Strings.\n\n10/10",

            "content": "Kubo And The Two Strings \n(2016)\n\nPlot:\nFrom the acclaimed animation studio, Laika (Coraline, The Boxtrolls) comes an epic original action adventure featuring the voice talents of Academy Award winners Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey. Kubo mesmerises the people in his village with his magical gift for spinning wild tales with origami. When he accidentally summons an evil spirit seeking vengeance, Kubo is forced to go on a quest to solve the mystery of his fallen samurai lather and his mystical weaponry, as well as discover his own magical powers.\n\nReview:\nAlthough this movie is pretty old now, I decided to watch it again recently, and I still think that it is a great film. The animation is top class, and the storyline is entertaining and enjoyable throughout. It didn't really smash the box office, after not getting a huge release but it's one of those films that is definitely worth a watch. It follows a young boy, Kubo (Art Parkinson), who looks after his mum in a cave after she suffers brain damage when she hits her head on a rock whilst travelling across the ocean. He lives a normal life in a quiet village, until a spirit returns from the past, which turns his life upside down. Having to escape from the village, to save his life, his mother recruits a little Snow Monkey, voiced by Charlize Theron, and a Beetle, voiced by Matthew McConaughey to look after him while he searches for a special magical suit of armour once worn by his father, who was a legendary Samurai Warrior. While Kubo is on his quest, he is attacked by his mother's evil sister sand his grandfather who stole his left eye. With the odds stacked up against him, the 12-year-old Kubo manages to get to the suit before his evil grandfather, the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) comes face to face with him but the traumatic journey leaves Kubo all alone to fight against the magical warrior. There are some touching moments throughout the movie, and it quite funny in parts, so there really is something for everyone. It's a bit difficult for the kiddies to follow but the monkey and the beetle will keep them entertained. Although there are some big names in the cast, it seems like it got the low budget treatment, which is a shame because it is much better than the bigger movies that weren't that great. Anyway, I really enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it for the whole family.\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Travis Knight, who also produced ParaNorman and The Boxtrolls. Although his previous movies were primarily for a young audience, this movie really does tug at the heartstrings, and the various cast members, all contributed something fresh to this original movie. The profit margin wasn't that great, which basically means that there won't be a sequel anytime soon but I hope that it's one of those movies that people will give a chance in the future.\n\nBudget: $60million\nWorldwide Gross: $70million\n\nGenre: Family, Adventure and Animation\nCast: Charlize Theron, Ralph Fiennes, Brenda Vaccaro, Cary-Hiroyuki, George Takei, Rooney Mara, Matthew McConaughey and Art Parkinson as Kubo. 8/10",

The monkey and the beetle make for a hilarious, chemistry-filled duo that protect Kubo and give him the parents he so much desired to have. Kubo thinks he has everything he could ever want, and that makes it all the more painful when it is so quickly ripped away from him, in order to do the greater good.

            "content": "This movie came to me highly recommended from movie critics that I deeply respect, and from the Academy (seeing that it was nominated for Best Animated Picture of 2016). I was excited to see it because I love stop motion animation and I love Japanese mythology. Unfortunately, after I saw it I didn't even really want to review it because it gave me nothing to talk about. It was one of those movies that you have a lot of expectations for, but it doesn't meet any of them. I decided to review it because I think there needs to be a balance of criticism. A movie is never just perfect or just god awful, a film usually lies in a grey area which is why it's so fun to review them. You'll pick out different shades than someone else might or might not.\n \nKubo and the Two Strings starts out with a woman on a boat who can part the seas with her shamisen. She's running away from a great evil and almost drowns. She even hits her head on a rock at the bottom of the sea and they show red blood, which for a kid's film which was pretty cool. Her and her baby land ashore and time flashes forward. The baby is now a young boy, Kubo, and the mother is now only a ghost of her formal magical shelf. She barley talks or remembers who her own son is. The beginning slow part I actually really enjoyed. The chemistry Kubo and his mom have together is really touching and beautiful. It's rare we get to see a mother-son relationship in kid's films. One day, Kubo stays out after dark and his mother's two evil sisters (who are moon people) descend upon him and try to steal his other eye. The moon king (Kubo's matrilineal grandfather) and his two daughters want to steal Kubo's other eye so he can join them in his moon kingdom where they can be immortal together. Kubo tries running away, but it's his mom who saves him and puts the last of her magic into his jade monkey relic. We later learn that his mother gave up immortality in the moon kingdom with her father and sisters for life in the human world, which is imperfect, but that's what makes it great.\n \nThe next morning, the monkey relic comes to life as a real snow monkey. The snow monkey is Kubo's mother. Kubo and his mother must go on a quest to find his father's magic armor (his father presumably died trying to get it the first time). Kubo must get the armor to protect himself from the moon king. A long the way, Kubo meets a cursed beetle who turns out to be his father. They kill the two moon sisters at the expense of Kubo's parents (ouch). Kubo, now an orphan, but with the armor, must defend himself against the moon king in the final battle. The moon king turns out to be an evil centipede who possessed his grandfather's soul and took his eyes. Kubo is able to defeat the creature, not by brute strength and his armor, but with his shamisen, and the three strings (one made of his mother's hair, the other from his father's bow, and the other hair from his own head). The twist ending is that after vanquishing the beast, his grandfather is left on earth. He doesn't remember anything that happened or that he was possessed by the moon spirit. When he asks who he was, the village people say that he was the kindest, most charitable man in the whole village. He's left alone to raise Kubo, and Kubo remains parentless, but finds solace in his spirituality.\n \nAt a glance, the film sounds pretty good. And it isn't bad. The animation is stunning. When the origami comes to life it's breathtaking. The boat made of out leaves was so cool! The eyes at the bottom of the long lake and the skeleton battle are really fun to watch. It made me feel like a kid again. I also liked a lot of the humor that came out of the monkey and beetle. I like how they were funny, but not comedic animal sidekicks. They had depth to them. The beetle was there mostly for laughs, but monkey really gets a lot of touching scenes. I also love how the animal versions of Kubo's parents have features from their human form. The monkey has a scar on her eye like Kubo's mother, and the beetle has markings on his face that look like facial hair. Those little details were great. I also greatly admire the time, effort, and passion that went in to making the entire film. If you look up the behind the scenes some of the technology they used to bring the story to life was incredible.\n \nThe majority of the film, besides how it looked, and the dialogue, fell flat. The plot, exposition, and motivations were weak. The plot of finding the armor is as basic of a hero's quest that there is. The only difference is that it's set in Japan. The exposition was hard to follow for the adults I was watching it with, imagine kids. I didn't really like the running quote, \"If you must blink, do it now.\" The voice actor didn't do it for me. I got a lot of it, but I was still confused at why Kubo's grandfather had one eye that worked at the end. Wasn't he completely blind before? And the metaphor of blindness leading to ignorance was a little forced. If anything, being blind actually makes you see more than actually having eyes (King Lear, Oedipus, The Odyssey, and Hercules). The motivation for the villains I didn't get either. So they have to take his other eye, not to kill him, but for him to join them? And they never show the other world that they want to take him to. How do we as audience know it's evil if we can't even see it?!\n \nThe ending with the grandpa was cute at first, but then I thought, what if he has flash backs of his former life like beetle did? Or what if he was born to do evil. Are they making a nature vs. nurture argument here? Not to mention, he never pays for what he did. They're just keeping him more blind and ignorant. If anything, they'll just confuse him and are taking advantage of someone who has amnesia. The theme of family they also try to push. Like if you don't have a complete family, that's okay. Or a family isn't just a mom, and a dad, it can be a monkey and beetle too. Ugh, I'm sick of animal metaphors. Are they equating unconventional families to animals? Lastly, the pacing of the jokes were really fast. A lot of them you miss if you're not paying attention closely (I guess that's the main theme of the movie, pay attention).\n \nAll in all, I think this film should have beaten out Zootopia as far as animated movies go. The animation was flawless, and though the story telling lacked, Zootopia I knew the end from the first 10 minutes, at least this film had me guessing. However, I still haven't seen My Life is a Zucchini or The Red Turtle, but I definitely want to. I give Kubo and the Two Strings 7/10.",

This is a beautiful film, stop motion stories are so few and far between and this one has such great character and monster designs, excellent set pieces and great attention to detail. The voice acting is also excellent, with Art Parkinson giving a very sincere and sweet performance as Kubo and a host of other famous names giving a very solid performance. It's a very good depiction of a Japanese story, with great attention to detail in costumes and setting, traditional customs, music and origami that separates it from most American animations.

The film has it's fair share of moments that adults will enjoy and would definitely be too frightening for young audiences, in the same vein of 2009's Coraline. An animated picture that actually has depth and a beautiful story is something that is common nowadays, and that's definitely a good thing. I'd also recommend staying until the closing credits for Regina Spektor's cover of \"My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and a glimpse into the agonisingly dedicated efforts that are put into stop-motion animation.",

Feel bad for this animated movie, that it didn't do well on the box office. The visually impressive effects, moderate humor and good story would have been a wonderful treat for the entire family.....Got slow at the middle but not as bad  nor boring as the Cars movie....the ending wasn't also that epic or overwhelming, but the entire movie\n was overall entertaining.",

            "content": "Kubo's striking visual effects immediately immerse you into Japan's Edo period, & sweep you on the mythical journeys that happen within it. Kubo follows an over-used 'chosen one' storyline; discovering more about his family and himself. I was hoping for something more unique. Kubo's strong characterisation of the protagonist ensures his appeal & increases audience's investment. He's mature, but not too mature. Kubo & the Two Strings follows a rather predictable storyline until the big twist is revealed near the end. It succeeded in surprising me. Kids will enjoy Kubo & the Two Strings for its sense of adventure, adults for Kubo's justice motive and incorporation of Japanese culture. Kubo & The Two Strings is a deep, heartfelt story incorporating challenging themes and culture. It's also great fun.",
