            "content": "it's an amazing film, which shows the progression and development of geeta phogat as she blossoms into a gold-winning medalist in the 2010 common wealth games. the movie shows mahavir singh-ji building geeta from the ground up, and reflects how hard, dedicated work will eventually pay off. back in the 90's, boys would be the ones wrestling and for a woman to participate in a girls sport would be seen as humorous. however, geeta breaks the stereotype. this movie empowers young women to be able to fulfill their dreams, regardless of what gender society assigns to sports, work, etc. the movie sends the message to young girls that they can achieve what they want, as geeta did, even if others look down upon them. it shows that in a male dominating society, where pay rolls are higher for male counterparts and where males are seen as superior, women too can play an equal or higher role than what is expected of them. in short, this movie empowers young women to destroy the gender-based barriers built around them so they can achieve their goals in life. i would recommend this movie to those who are into wrestling, who haven't watched bollywood movies, or who are simply looking for a new film to watch. 5/5 stars, made me cry like 3 times.\n\n- gavin",

The movie makes you want to get out of bed and start working on your goals and dreams. It has layers and sub themes that I love to see through characters, through picturization and throwing subtext.

However, the first chunk of this film is yawnful, with the story falling to initially inspire - just a guide on how to be a bad parent, in anything. The ending is also pretty cartoonish, with the broom cupboard stuff.\n\nThe cast performances are, in fairness, very good. Aamir Khan does great as Mahavir, while Fatima Sana Shaikh (and Zaira Wasim) are impressive as Geeta. Sanya Malhotra (and Suhani Bhatnagar) deserve praise also.\n\nWith that noted, It isn't really anything all that fresh for Bollywood sport biopics either. It follows similar beats to 2014's 'Mary Kom' and 2015's 'Brothers'... even 2011's 'Patiala House'.\n\nFor me, this 2016 production just feels so bloated and forced that it hampers the, admittedly noteworthy, hearty narrative. The leads are the only strong points to it in my opinion. It has been very highly received by others, so what do I know? Opinions and all that.",

The father was once a successful wrestler but was forced to give up his dream due to financial straits. He hopes that his sons could fulfill his dream but he only has four daughters. However, he discovers the striking talents of wrestling in his two daughters by accident. Then the father trains the daughters strictly and finally they become champions. The inspirational scenes of wrestling in the movie are so amazing that they arouse strong passion among audience. When watching the final scene in which Geeta defeats her opponent in the final round and the national anthem starts for her championship, I got moved because their father's dream is finally fulfilled after various frustrations and Geeta eventually becomes a successful woman with self value, which is contrasted with the traditional female images in India. She experienced a harsh childhood. Her strong ambition as well as masculine appearance always couldn't be understood by people with traditional Hindustani mind.  She is also torn between the hardline approaches of her father and the theory-oriented approach by her coach and fell into confusion after she attends the sports academy. But at the time that she wins in the international competition and the national flag rises for her, we could see that fortunately, all her hard work pays off. The status of women in athletic field gains recognition. And that exciting moment also marked that the deep-rooted stereotype that women are destined to depend on their husband could be alleviate in Indian people's mind. The film emphasizes nationalism and feminism. The patriarchal father definitely loves their daughters deeply, which could be revealed in the wedding scene. In countryside Indian society, women usually don't have any right to fulfill their own dreams, but Geeta's father firmly allows their daughters to challenge the tradition. He believes that his daughters are so excellent that they shouldn't be chosen by men in marriage. Furthermore, I want to say that the actors in the film are all extremely devoted. I hear from the news that Aamir Khan changes his posture rapidly during the shoot of the film in order to fit the appearance of the father in different periods. Also, the wrestling scenes performed by the daughters are amazing. They remind me of the fighting scenes in Deewar(1975) in which Vijay fights against the villains in a warehouse. Both of them succeed in shocking the audience and the win of the protagonist could push the plot into climax. Compared to earlier melodramatic Bollywood films, Dangal appears to be authentic and convincing.

            "content": "Dangal impresses me by its interesting plots and powerful emotion behind it. I always think that a sports movie must be boring, but Dangal changes my mind. The dramatic tension attracts audiences' interest, which makes the film successful. I remember the first impressive scene is that Geeta competed with a boy and lost the game. I thought she would win the game since the film uses a long time to portray that no one trusts her. In a general filming way, the film must prove that she has the ability since she is trained well. However, the result contradicts my assumption, which attracts me to know later plots. It also serves as the motivation for Geeta to practice harder. Moreover, I love the scene from 01:14:44 to 01:16:34 which portrays Geeta's international championship and Babita's national championship at the same time. This film emphasizes the importance of the father's role in children's life. This scene uses rapid cuts of two daughters' championship to show that they need to listen to their father's instructions. This instruction here is not only the simple instruction for competition but also the instruction for their life. Geeta's failure and Babita's success makes the strong comparison that increases the dramatic tension that Geeta must get father's help to win the game. The way that the film depicts Geeta's and Babita's experience makes the film become more interesting and attracts audiences' attention.\nCompared to Dangal, Bollywood films sometimes depict the importance of the mother's role in children's life. In Mother India, the father seems to be a useless person, and the mother can support the whole family. Mother is always willing to sacrifice and devote themselves to children. Thomas says in \"Melodrama and The Negotiation of Morality,\" \"In a Hindi film, a mother's love for her son is always unquestionable and appears to serve as the prototype of all kinship emotion\" (Thomas 167). The sentence reveals that the difference between the mother's love and the father's love is that the mother will love the son without thinking about political or economic benefits. However, the father always forces children to marry people that they do not want to, and it is hard for them to show their love. In Qayamat Se Qayamat Ta and Veer Zaara, fathers serve as roles who forces children to achieve their goals. However, Dangal shows a different father's character who loves his daughter, cries when the daughter says sorry, and begs the coach to treat his daughter well. I am impressed when he speaks to the coach to help Geeta wins the competition when Geeta first joins the training. He has strong self-esteem, and he does not like to show his weaknesses. However, the contradiction that he begs due to his daughter makes me understand he loves the daughter. I can see his love as the same way when I see mother's love in Mother India that both of them are willing to sacrifice. I would like to see a different father's image who loves daughters and shows his passion in Dangal.",

            "content": "The film Dangal, starring Amir Khan, Fatima Sana Shaikh, and Sanya Malhotra, tells the true story of a family's journey to athletic success.  After Mahavir Singh Phogat is unable to win a wrestling medal for his country, he trains his two daughters, Geeta and Babita, to achieve his unattained success.  Throughout the film, the audience sees the physical and societal obstacles that this family faces in pursuit of this athletic glory.  Despite the father's initial coercion of his dreams onto his daughters, the film actually brings a sense of empowerment to the audience.  The montages of the daughters' training highlight their difficulties both physically and socially, making their successes that much more inspiring.  The wrestling scenes are so well choreographed and realistic, allowing the audience to feel the wrestlers' struggle.  When the daughters are standing victorious and proud in front of their country, the audience cannot help but feel empowered.\n\tOne of the most prominent themes in this film is nationalism and pride.  As stated by Tejaswini Ganti, the film explores the idea of \"constructing a national identity\" that honors the country (Ganti 32, \"Bollywood\").  In this film, the father wants to contribute to this honor by becoming a nationally established wrestling coach.  This theme of nationalism becomes a factor in the relationship between the father and the daughters.  Specifically, the daughters initially conflict with their father because of his demanding trainings and expectations.  However, this conflict is fueled by the father's unfulfilled desire to make his country proud through sport.  This father-daughter dynamic can also be seen in Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ).  In DDLJ, Simran's relationship with her father is strained when she wants to marry someone the father does not believe is a true Hindustani.  In this case, the father's sense of national morality causes his conflicting relationship with his daughter.  Both films showcase a strained father-daughter relationship that is partially caused by the father's nationalistic pride.  As a whole, Dangal is a film that empowers the audience through its incorporation of themes of nationalism and struggle.",

            "content": "If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down.\n\nSCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary.\n\nDIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character.\n\nFIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication.\n\nACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie.\n\nFINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.",

            "content": "The year was 2004 and a film with an extremely unconventional approach to a widely explored genre of sports drama won four Academy Awards, including the best picture- Million Dollar Baby. How is it possible that the film which, initially, rejected by several studios including Warner Bros went on to sweep critics off their feet and earn $217 million? Because, Million Dollar Baby had the audacity to challenge the traditional framework of gender favoritism in combat sport. Dangal manages to do exactly the same and not in comparatively liberal America, but rather in India where traditions and conventions are deeply embedded. Dangal follows the story of father Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) who trains young daughters Geeta (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (Sanya Malhotra) to follow in his footsteps and become world-class wrestlers. While the former was purely fictional, Dangal is real and is based on the life of Indian wrestler and senior Olympics coach- Mahavir Singh Phogat.    \n\nAlthough Dangal, superficially seems to be, but should not be mistaken for merely a sports drama. Dangal, a Hindi word translates into \"wrestling arena\" and the film, as the name suggests, is a battle not just between individuals but also between progressive and moderate social norms. Dangal takes battle of the sexes to a whole new level in some scenes where Babita grapples and clinches her male counterparts who are twice her size. The scene wherein father, Mahavir Singh Phogat, compels his daughter, Babita, to cut her hair shifts gear of the film from what seemed to be a blithe spirited until now into a more serious note. Mahavir Singh Phogat is a strict father because he knows a man cannot be a loving father and an effective coach at the same time. The most important wresting match in the film is not the finals of Commonwealth games but rather the match between father Mahavir and his estranged daughter Babita. Ego is one tricky state of mind because one may not realize when their confidence turns into their vanity. The movie also explores the subject of vanity, dedication and discipline surrounding the sport. The thing about the film that baffled me the most is its uncanny resemblance to Foxcatcher(2014) in respect of its portrayal of different kind of mentors.\n\nGiven the focus of this film, much depends on the character of Geeta, and Fatima Sana Shaikh is strong and effective in the role; her confidence shines. Amir Khan, superb actor that he is, seems to be an obvious choice to play Mahavir Singh Phogat, and I believed him. His physical transformation is commendable. None could have pulled it off better. Mahavir's wife, Daya Shobha Kaur (played by Sakshi Tanwar) is more of a place-holder but she does an effective job of bringing a note of compassion into the picture. I would give a special applaud to Zaira Wasim and Sanya Malhotra who played the role of young Geeta and Babita respectively, for they did an excellent job pulling off such demanding task with such perfection. Director Nitesh Tiwari, of whom I was not so sure after his last attempt on Kill Dil(2014), surely proved me wrong with his composed storytelling.  \n    \nDangal is not just a film - it is a statement. And to think that all of this is real life incident makes its impact even more powerful. It stands for just the kind of women empowerment that the world actually needs.",

The negatives were the fictional introduction of a villainous coach, I felt the real life story is rich enough with contents that no masala was needed. Same goes for matches shown in the movie, I felt cinematic liberties should not have been taken to give the matches a cliff-hanger, the cast with their performances could have made the real matches interesting enough. \nThe real stars of the movie are the people, both the cast and the ones they are based on in real life, amazing achievement by the Phogat family and superb enacting of them on film by these young artists.

If you don't like Indian movies because of the random dancing that bursts out during the storyline, don't worry... all the dancing in this movie actually belongs in the story.  I highly recommend this movie even if you aren't a wrestling fan or an Indian movie fan because it's just so much fun to watch.",

            "content": "Short Review-\n\nFirst, they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. - Mahatma Gandhi\n\n\nLong Review-\n\nSome movies cast heroes, some give chance to new entrants to emerge as heroes. Rarely do we come across a movie where heroes do not just emerge on screen but off it too. Dangal is one such movie where we have a lot of off-screen superstars.\n\nFive minutes into the movie you see three names. One, Arjun Awardee Kripa Shankar Bishnoi as wrestling coordinator and other two, Prakash Bhardwaj and Sunita Sharma as Haryanvi dialect coach. How often do you see unusual credits like that?\n\nDo we ever realize that how many movies became successful solely because of a man called Mukesh Chhabra was behind those movies? It's high time we start understanding their contributions too. For them, this movie started a year or at least six months before they actually started shooting. This movie is the result of endless efforts of all those off-screen superstars.\n\nDangal is quite ok at being a sports movie. But it still is one of the best movies of this year. Probably because it doesn't want to be just a sports movie and it actually is not. One may find some striking similarity between Dangal and any other Indian sports film but we need to understand that most sports film progress in more or less same fashion. It's Nitesh Tiwari who turns a simple story into a powerful film and he has his past record of doing so. Chiller Party and Bhootnath Returns, two movies with the ordinary story but the extraordinary execution. Same is the case here. Yes, he used his cinematic liberties at some places to make it a little more dramatic than the actual events.\n\nThe movie documents a remarkable tale of how women of Haryana, the state which is notorious for being most misogynist state of our country, blossomed in a sport which is dominated by men. And the best thing, it is not limited to it. Dangal is the story of a father and his unending quest of bringing glory to the country. Yes, to the country and not to self. And in the process to achieve that feat, it shows the struggle of a father who went against all odds which circumstances has thrown at him. Be it physical, mental or cultural. He waited from black to salt and pepper till gray. He waited from being a masculine senior wrestler to being a heavy belly senior citizen. He has been ridiculed but he never left his dream. And he is not doing this just to satisfy his male ego but to bring gold for the country. It's about equality, gender equality. It's about realizing that a woman is not just as good as a man but she has the potential of outperforming him too and she is doing it at the time and again. It's about woman empowerment. Emerging strong from a soil, which is still khap-ridden, where honor killing is practiced and the birth of a girl child is still looked down upon is not an easy thing to do. It's about that never say die attitude which at the end always result in victory, again not just on but off the screen too.\n\nA lot has been talked about Aamir and two (Read Four) leading ladies (Fatima, Sanya & Zaira, Suhani) of the film and they lived up to every hype they were surrounded with. It's good to see that Aamir never let his superstar aura overshadow the performances of girls. And not just performances, even in general the two ladies has been portrayed as the face of Dangal.\n\nA big shout out to two actors who stayed away from limelight all this while but acted tremendously well. Sakshi Tanwar, who, in spite of getting lesser dialogues, killed with her expressions and body language. She definitely is the first person to gloriously come out of Balaji camp since Ronit Roy. Aparshakti Khurrana, narrator and supporting character who has a responsibility of movie far more than a normal supporting actor in a Hindi movie has, and he managed to act really well. For Girish Kulkarni, I have seen better of him, far better.\n\nDangal is an average sports drama, a good biopic, and a brilliant movie. Powered by stellar performances and terrific direction, this movie is the result of sweat, tears, and broken bones. While the movie ends on a happy note it leaves several questions for us behind.\n\n1. A biopic is good but why we always need one to feel proud of our stars?\n\n2. How many sports film do we need to make those committees to pass funds to a non-cricketing sport?\n\n3. Why we only preparing our athletes (Or are we?) to win any medal and not Gold medal?\n\n4. Five years down the line will we remember Geeta and Babita Phogat for 2010 and 2014 commonwealths or will we remember her for Dangal?\n\nOn a lighter note, Dangal is for everyone. It is a non-masala commercial movie. So when we have helped some senseless movies to score big on box office, why not help this one which actually deserves.",

            "content": "Being an Aamir Khan fan has its problems. You have to wait for years for a single movie to hit the theater. And considering he is in his 50s now, we hardly have any time left. But what keeps us happy is that he hardly ever compromises on quality ( except Dhoom 3 ofcourse). His hit rate is tremendous and going by the reviews of this film, I knew that this wouldn't be bad either. One review said, it was better than Lagaan! Wow... Now that is a pretty extraordinary claim. Having seen it, I must say it isn't as good as Lagaan because it isn't as complex or huge, but it is a pretty good movie in its own right.\n \nBased on the real life story of a pretty extra-ordinary man, his extra-ordinary daughters and one slightly extra-ordinary nephew, this is a sports movie with a difference. Most sports movies in India do not place too much emphasis on the technique of that sport. A boxer can get away with simply putting on Satin shorts and tap dancing in the ring. But the sports choreography and cinematography of the wrestling sequences in this film is brilliant to say the least! And that's what places this film several notches above most Indian sports films.\n \nIf you have seen the trailer, then you know that this is about a fanatical father who imposes his dreams unto his daughters, becomes haanikarak for them and then inspires them to win gold medals for India. Now, I have read in some places that this is the ultimate misaal of chauvinism, where the father imposes his dreams onto his daughters and just because everything turns out right in the end, doesn't mean his abuse was right.\n\nRight and wrong. Everything has a context. Before judging the man, we should understand the time and the place he did it in. Fighting the entire system and societal norms is not easy, and even though it had a selfish motive, his heart was always in the right place. He saw potential in his kids and set out to realize it. What we also forget is that his kids started liking the sport and hence their training continued. So yes, this is a story worth telling. The Williams sisters' tale is very similar, but just imagine if they were in Haryana where the Khap Panchayat believes that having Manchurian causes rapes!\n \nNow, let's talk about the film. It starts off a little weakly, as the sequences are unevenly edited and the dialogues lack punch. But half an hour into the film, it starts gaining momentum with little Geeta getting into bouts with flustered boys. While Aamir goes on with his duty of captaining the ship like a champ, the young girls steal your heart with their innocence. And then there is the boy who does the narration, Phogat's nephew!  He infuses life into the film and binds it together with his endearing one liners. The second half, has some really powerful scenes with the father-daughter relationship hitting a nadir and then getting back on track. Even the bouts, though detailed, are thoroughly entertaining. The amount of effort the girls - both Jr. and Sr. have put in the fight sequences is phenomenal. Hats off to them.\n \n \nYes, the film has its flaws. The villain in this film is poorly manufactured. When you have a good actor like Girish Kulkarni, it is criminal to not define his character properly. He is the weakest link in the film and his final shadyantra in the film seems utterly forced.\n \nAll in all, this is a movie worth showing your family. It is a sports film, but it is also about the dangal between an ambitious father and his rebellious daughter. You will laugh, cry, get bored but also feel inspired. The range of emotions it taps into is what makes the film a winner. And then there is Aamir, who never looks like the hero, but is very much the life of the film. He lets the girls take over and watches them from the sidelines. It is amazing how he allows the other characters to come to the fore in his films and restrains himself from always overshadowing everyone. That's what really sets him apart. Plus, his body transformation is the stuff of legends. Go watch it. It's worth the weight ( gain and loss)!",

            "content": "After Lagaan and Chak De India, another sports movie that captures the soul of \"Indian\" sports -- warts and all -- while following all the tropes of blockbuster underdog sports movies. While the villain in Dangal was the centerpiece of Chak De India, a low-paid government coach in a thankless job, the two movies work as a brilliant double-feature. Fans of Bollywood will appreciate the delicious off-screen rivalry between the leads, Shahrukh and Aamir respectively, which ultimately gave us one of their most transformed performances ever. Dangal wins with a healthy dose of earthy humor sprinkled on tough scenes, and focus on set-pieces rather than melodrama to tell the tale of \"girl like you in a place like this\". While unlikely to change long held patriarchy and apathy in sports, and unlikely to spur robust interest in wrestling, Dangal is an important milestone for good film-making and perhaps glimmering hope of creating a sports culture in India. Great work, Mr.Tiwari!",

Challenge accepted - office floor is converted to an Akhara. Character is introduced as an ex National Champion.} \nFan: Yeah, what an intro! Aamir is the boss. \nConn: But, subtlety? A bit on your face, isn't it? Promos have been telling you for so many months that the man is a wrestler, what is the surprise? \nFan: This movie is about woman empowerment and patriotism. Made by Aamir, you know more than him? \nConn: I have been watching world cinema for 4 decades now. Did you watch Million Dollar Baby? Or, Creed? Introduction of protagonist is subtle and powerful. \nFan: Saala Khadoos! \nConn: Yeah, even that was subtle. A character needs to be established for the various dimensions it has, like a normal human being. \n{Aamir is already making his daughters' life miserable on screen} \nConn: His character is so one dimensional! So, is the wife, compliant otherwise but strict about the kitchen. Daughters seem like puppets. From the instance of their introduction, it's only wrestling for them. Did they not have real problems of men touching them intimately in a rural society? What if dangals coincide with their monthly periods? Where is the subtext of a woman in the socio-cultural context? And even the cousin, almost a buffoon and effeminate. \nFan: Boss, this is based on real life. Real life has no drama, only hard work. See, how the girl is beating the boys in the street fights? Such message about girl child! That too, in Haryana. \nConn: OK, then a documentary on the Phogat family should have done it. Messages would have been real and direct. Isn't it? \n{The girl has grown up. The new girl is pretty, and there are whistles from somewhere in the dark} \nFan: Now, the real show will start! All championship fights. Full paisa vasool! \nConn: Oh, have you watched Commonwealth Games videos on YouTube? Fan: Of whom, this girl? \nConn: No, the original Geeta. Could have been included in the\ndocumentary. Why make a feature film of that? \n{Intermission has started. Fan rushed to be early in the queue for overpriced popcorn and cola. His child and wife too went with him. He kept telling wife to take care of the child in the toilet, quite loudly. Movie restarted. Fan rushed back with his family after a little while.} \nFan: What did I miss? Father and daughter are fighting I see. Why? \nConn: It seems that once the female athletes reach the Academy, they get more interested in fashion, boys, movies etc. They grow their hair. Wonder what P T Usha used to do! Or Malleswari.\nFan: Who are these people? Did they win Commonwealth medals? \nConn: Malleswari got Olympic medal, my friend! \nFan: Arre, Phogats are international wrestlers, Bhai! When Aamir has picked up their life, they must be the best. \nConn: Aamir perhaps chose the Haryana story, so that the pretty actresses from mainstream can depict them. Malleswari is from Andhra, stout, not very easy to find a mainstream actress like her. Moreover, weightlifting is not half as glamorous as women's wrestling. \n{On screen, a national level coach is making an ass of himself. The daughter drifted away from the father and, predictably, lost all the international matches. From the first scene of their conflict, everyone knew that they would reconcile. Aamir gets the control of her daughter's life back and starts phone-training her. The pitiable daughter succumbs to the fatherly diktats} \nFan: What an actor! Gained so much weight and now, he has lost so much! Only Aamir can do this? \nConn: Ever watched Captain America? Chris Evans was skinny and muscular in the same movie. \nFan: That's why I call you anti-national! Why do you always quote America? India doesn't make movies or what? \nConn: Sir, this is cinema, world of make believe. And, in any case, a man who gains weight so much after his athletic days, usually do not have such muscular triceps and biceps. Muscles sag without practice. \nFan: You are doubting Aamir's method acting? See, how authentic is his Haryanvi! \nConn: Can you speak the language? \nFan: No, why do I need to? \nConn: Kangana in TMWT would have won by far, if Haryanvi accent were the basis of good acting. \n{In the meanwhile, there is an announcement in the film about the National Anthem to be played before a match. Spectators stood up like clockwork puppets the moment the band starts playing. This is not the mandatory stand-up, thought the connoisseur and spread on the push-back seat. Fan gave one hard look at him. Connoisseur pulled himself up.} \nFan: Now, the climax starts. Oh, my God! Mahabir Phogat ji faced such jealousy? Mean people! That's why nothing happens in Sports in this country! \nConn: What sports do you play? \nFan: Where is the time? Office, family, child's education... \nConn: And your child? Which sports does he like to play? \nFan: Where is the playing space in an apartment? Look, how close the competition is between Geeta and that Australian girl! \nConn: We all know that Geeta would win. Where is the suspense in the climax? And you know, the original match was a smooth sail for Geeta? \nFan: Boss, we don't come to a movie to learn history. 'Entertainment, entertainment, entertainment, as Vidya Balan had said, is the hob of a movie. That Dangal has done. I am happy! \n{Credits start rolling. Connoisseur and fan depart, waving at each other. The crowd of Christmas cum Sunday evacuates. 'Super hit' was the verdict even before the movie was released. Now, it's only a scoring game of the centuries of crores. Savvy marketeer, smart selector of themes, average actor and film maker - this defines the Hindi megastars. Who directed this movie, connoisseur tried to recall. Who cares! Aamir is there, his courtiers need just that.}",

The movie reminded me so much of Moti Nandi novels, especially Koni which was also brought to the silver screen and went on to win a national award in 1984. Aamir Khan, mostly a father of few words with immense energy and passion for his sports, brought forward a formidable coach figure whose nurturing nature and perseverance helped his daughters scale great heights. Dangal has good intentions at heart and but becomes too formulaic with time. Things became very predictable in the second half, and the climax was no different. But I feel the movie did well within its scope by playing safe. The cinematography was top notch, all of those wrestling scenes were shot with so much care and thought.

            "content": "Over the years, a film starring Aamir Khan has gained a status of being an event, mainly as there are only a handful of artists in India who are so picky & committed to delivering as Aamir Khan, whose efforts are so sincere that you end up forgoing the film's multiple flaws. This wrestling based biopic on the Phogat Sisters, the elder one, Geeta who made history by being the first Indian female wrestler to win the Gold medal (55kg) and the younger Babita won Silver medal (51 Kg) in 2010 Commonwealth games and their father Mahavir Singh Phogat who trained them, is no different. While off late, Bollywood have witnessed many sports films in the form of Chake De India, Bhag Milkha Bhag, Mary Kom, Saala Khadoos, M.S. Dhoni & some others, very few have been so focused on the sport as this one. If you are going to avoid this film by comparing it with Sultan with a prejudice mind, I must say you are terribly mistaken. While the Salman Khan starrer Sultan was a mere entertainment this film is a class apart as Aamir Khan knows his game far better & wouldn't just repeat himself, forget repeating another actor. This film works as a classic sports film with an eye for detail and a good measure of technique thrown into the poignant emotional drama about a stubborn father who lives his lifelong dream, and his daughters. There are sermons about gender balance, a generous dose of patriotism but what really drives this film is wrestling. Orchestrated in a real set up, the film is rustic and robust, unleashing the infallible energies of two unbeatable girls who train to pummel hard enough to earn dignity in another sport besides the ever engaging cricket. It is even more difficult for women, more so if they belong to a more patriarchal pocket of the country. Aamir Khan chooses a worthy story of a father who makes a difference to the thinking of his small town. I agree, this film is far from being flawless, mainly as it has a well-known, off-repeated story and its technique and template are both similar to every other sports film, but where it fares phenomenally is the meticulously attention to perfection - as expected from Aamir Khan, and the film scores on almost every aspect be it detailing, storytelling, entertainment value, drama or humor. The story follows Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan), a home-grown National-level wrestling champion who had to leave wrestling to get a proper job. Keeping his passion & love for the sport alive by enjoying the local matches or just by feeling nostalgic by looking at the medals and certificates he had won, Mahavir hopes to see his unborn son fulfill his tarnish dreams of making India proud by winning gold at an international level. Blame it on his X chromosomes, but he and his wife Daya Shobha Kaur (Sakshi Tanwar) give birth to not one, not two, but four daughters, much to Mahavir's disappointment. He surprisingly stops trying for a fifth child and packs up his dreams. However, as the kids grow up and show signs of aggressiveness, he realizes that even though their gender orientation is different from his, they may be good contenders for the game of wrestling. Convinced that his two eldest daughters, young Geeta (Zaira Wasim) and Babita (Suhani Bhatnagar), may help him take his passion forward, he begins training them - pure street level-style. Following Mahavir's strict native coaching as the girls grow up (Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra) and try to climb the ladder, albeit while facing a series of stereotypes, hurdles, and rampant demoralization from the society, just to fulfill their father's long awaited dream. Five minutes is all it will take you to get hooked into the otherwise long film (at 161 stimulating minutes). Delightful sequences that will lie out what is to be expected as you move forward with Mahavir and his daughters' story. Director Nitesh Tiwari (Bhoothnath Returns, Chillar Party)dedicates the entire first half to the little girls, reeling under the pressure of their over ambitious father's expectations of them. They wobble, fall but never have the heart to give up. They eventually rise to the occasion and prove their mettle and merit. While the story is impressive, the best part is the details that doesn't restrict itself to Mahavir Singh Phogat's dream but goes beyond to touch issues around the social exploitation of women, gender based discrimination, the mentality of treating girl child as a baggage, the male-child mania, the state of sports infrastructure in India, the importance of a right coach for a sportsperson and even religious harmony. However, it also depicts something wrong in the Indian society which is the obsession of Indian parents' using their children to fulfill their dreams. The male gaze also makes an appearance here as Mahavir gives zero care to the world and moves ahead with his talented daughters in an attempt to shift mountains. How a father does what he does, regardless of his approach, but still thinks of his girls' upbringing and a bright future is what the film essentially talks about. It tries to smash and subdue the voices that sway in the air about inequality, and oppression of women and their rights. As far as the narrative is concerned, it's a triumph, because it sheds light on both sides of the coin. Mahavir's wife is worried about her daughters' food-making skills, but she is cajoled that people are not living in caves anymore. The film tightly slaps on the conventional thinking of society that the women are only intended to live to look after their family and should stay back behind the curtain for specific reasons and the Man Mahavir Singh was there to thrash all those concepts and in the end we could feel the satisfaction he might have had in the real life. That predominantly male bastion extends not only to the contact sport in question, but also to Haryana where this true story is set; a culture so steeped in patriarchy that neighbors volunteer helpful tips towards producing a male heir to parents who've birthed multiple daughters. Like I said before the film had many thrilling moments to make you bite your nails. It made my eyes wet at times, It even made me proud when the national anthem sounded in, knowing the facts that it's just a film. The good thing was the makers did not use their cinematic freedom to exaggerate the things and whatever we saw on the big screen were quite convincing within their limitation of detailing a real life event. Director Nitesh Tiwari focuses more on the relationship between the Mahavir Phogat and Babita Kumari and Geeta Phogat. Unlike the Salman Khan film, the wrestling drama is an emotional journey of a father teaching his daughters about the wrestling sports rather than full-fledged romantic action film. The film opens well with Aamir Khan wrestling with his colleague at office. The subsequent scenes where he teaches his daughters the art of wrestling is brilliantly portrayed. The wrestling arena scene where the young Geeta fights with a boy for the first time is eye-popping. Kudos to Nitesh Tiwari for keeping us engaged at this time. The second half tells how Geeta Phogat joining the NSA (National Sports Academy) but in spite of having a wrestling coach, gets trained under her father to win the gold medal at the Common Wealth Games 2010. The wrestling scenes are probably the best scenes you will witness on the silver screen. The semi-final and the final match for gold is the highlight of the film. Thanks to wonderful screenplay written by Piyush Gupta, Shreyas Jain, Nikhil Mehrotra and Nitesh Tiwari, the film will keep you on your toes right from the beginning till the end. As a character, Mahavir is in equal parts determined and unmistakably selfish, practically robbing the girls of their childhood, denying them normal pleasures in his obsession with discipline and his quest for excellence. It's a tricky area to explore and a braver film might have gone down that road, but given that this is practically a biopic, the script steers clear of raising uncomfortable questions. What we get is one line, late in the film, where Mahavir acknowledges that the only fault of his daughters is that their father is a madman. The rigorous training the girls are put through, the sniggering from a chauvinistic society, the clashes with sports authorities, and the thrilling, nail-biting bouts all ring true without a hint of artifice. There are layers too, if you seek them. One of the best bits in the film is a scene in which Mahavir and Geeta wrestle. On the face of it, it's just that - father vs. daughter. But simmering beneath the surface is so much more. It's these layers, tucked away but easily sought, that separate the film from your standard sports film. The script digs deep to give us genuinely affecting moments like Geeta's discovery of her own feminity, and her first brush with boys outside the mud ground, not to mention her sheer amazement over the effect a romantic Hindi film can have on a hostel full of girls. As mentioned before, like most sports film this one is also marred by clichés. It's impossible to evade the conventional trappings of the genre and this film has its fair share of those, but the biggest thing is that it knows when to stop, and that's what makes it a stadium like live experience. As expected, Aamir Khan justifies his role, and makes it obvious why he is showered with certain adjectives and nouns. He is so outstanding in his performance that this could be considered as one of his best works ever. Aamir has trained for 8-10 months for wrestling and went through a huge transformation from being fit to fat for 90% portion of the film and then trained for 5 months to go from fat to fit to work on the initial portion of the film that is only for 5-7 minutes in duration. He really gets into the skin of the character like never before. We all know what this man is capable of and must say that he deserves the credit for portraying such a role which eventually concentrates on the female characters as the film progresses. That shows how passionate he is about this art called cinema. His transformation from the macho man to old age fat man was absolutely magical but the same time his eyes had the same intensity all the way long. Sakshi Tanwar plays a very noticeable role with multiple projections of an apologetic wife in the beginning that turns into a strong homemaker and a mother who tries every bit to draw line when her husband's obsession becomes a nightmare for her kids, especially with a fragile relationship of her husband and her eldest daughter. Young Debutants Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar as the young Geeta and Babitha were absolutely flawless and charming, while Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra also gave in outstanding award winning performances. Ritwik Sahore as the younger Omkar and Aparshakti Khurana as the older Omkar are excellent. On the whole, 'Dangal' is a powerful, inspirational, brilliant, all heart and entertaining sports drama that is without a doubt the best film of 2016. Like always, Aamir saves the best for last!",

Many of the cliches one associates with a sports drama are all there in good measure; yet Khan and co make sure that the viewer buys into the story. The fights are well choreographed/shot and appear more grounded n' authentic than any other wrestling-related flick made in Bollywood so far. The climax is a teary-eyed crowd pleaser.",

His latest, \"Dangal\" is a very good feel good sports drama that is definitely worth seeing. I do think it is slighlty lesser to some of his past entries, but considering those are pretty much perfect films, it's impressive that this one still comes pretty close in terms of quality. Aamir Khan's pefromance is fantastic as always and he really shows his commitment to the role in this one with his tremendous weight gain. The other actors and actresses all do a fantastic job as well. The movie has plenty of heart and humorous movies. My only real complaint is that sometimes the movie jumps time somewhat abrubtly but considering it kept me entertained for it's near 3 hour run time, I'd say it compensated for it for the most part. It's a feel-good movie that is perfect to watch over the holidays. Defintiely go see it if you're a fan of Indian movies and/or Aamir Khan.",

Dangal is a biopic on Mahavir Phogat and his daughters Geeta and Babita who go on to win several medals on the international stage. The film benefits heavily from a near perfect casting. The four actresses playing the roles of the daughters are exceptional and are the life and soul of the film rather than the grumpy faced Aamir Khan. Aamir also does a good job but it is definitely not his best. While the film tries to put forth the issues of gender inequality, sports corruption in India and male patriarchy it hardly skims the surface. It is more of a father-daughter relationship drama than an actual sports film and Chak De India and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag continue to be the iconic sports films that have been produced in India. Additionally, the film is devoid of heart racing and inspirational moments, which are actually a routine in sport movies. The wrestling sequences though are superbly shot especially the one where Geeta fights in sheer egoistical anger with her father in the Akhada. Dangal is watchable but it is definitely not path breaking and neither will it leave a lasting impression. Like Aamir says - \"Misaalein di jaati hain\".",
