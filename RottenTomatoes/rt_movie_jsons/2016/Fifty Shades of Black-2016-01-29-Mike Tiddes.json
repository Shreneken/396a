Roughly 10% of the jokes that Wayans pitched in the movie landed, and the ones that didn't weren't even really appreciable - my facial expression didn't change at all from them.",

            "content": "Fifty Shades of Black is directed by Michael Tiddes, and it stars Marlon Wayans in a spoof comedy about a college student that come across Christian Black (Marlon Wayans), and he come across his interest to her and wanting to be with her, with a paper agreement that Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk) that is. When seeing that there's a parody film of Fifty Shades of Grey be done by Marlon Wayans, is something that makes me worried about, and seeing that it has worse reviews than any of the 50 Shades Series, got me scared. So when seeing the series, of course I am going to watch it and I managed to find it on DirecTV, and while it's the best, it's more pathetic than those films. The main acting is really trying to make those jokes work, which in the right film, Marlon Wayans and Kali Hawk can be really funny together. There are some moments where I was amused like almost every time that King Bach is in this, and then there are some funny moments like Christian Black wrecking things to attack her butt, and when he spanks her butt, Hannah goes back at him, and I think it's because they did something comedic with a scene that I recognize from the film and make it quick enough that doesn't linger on the joke. Those are the only positives thing I can say, as for the negatives, there are some things that I can say. Most of the jokes don't make me laugh, it lingers on like a Family Guy joke that is never funny, and can irritate the crap out of me. There are a lot of character inconsistencies to the point that I just didn't care, and there are some Internet stuff in here that just seem lazy and tacked in. There are some stuff in there that's just gross for the sake of being disgusting, and it's really lame to watch. Fifty Shades of Black is a terrible movie that while it didn't make me as mad as Fifty Shades of Grey, I was just really disappointed that this movie could've been so much better.",

Then the movie comes, and during the sex scenes, Dakota Johnson is as thrilled as a kid in a candy shop, while Jamie Dornan is as thrilled as when I have to talk to someone I don't like, and it's incredibly painful to get through, and you should probably get some kind of award if you make it through just the first book and movie. Which brings us to this movie. Marlon Wayans has incredible charisma. However, that does not mean he is a gifted comedy writer. It is by no means a perfect parody. But, it is an extremely stupid comedy, and if stupid makes you laugh, then this will do the trick. It's also a lot less painful, the hour and a half goes by very quickly. The only reason to watch this is if you are a die hard fan of Marlon Wayans, or if fifty shades of grey ruined your life like it ruined mine. That should do the trick just fine.",

Obviously a parody of Fifty Shades of Grey, this is about a plain college student (Kali Hawk) entering a relationship with wealthy businessman (Marlon Wayans) that she quickly learns engages in some sordid sexual practices.  Hilarity ensues (but not really).  To every Yin, there must be a Yang, and I believe that if you don't take the time to brave and witness the truly dreadful that Hollywood has to offer, you will be less likely to fully appreciate a great movie.  Also, in addition to that, I want to be able to make a respectable worst of list for the year, which is the entire reason why I chose to watch Fifty Shades of Black.  I've got to say: Marlon Wayans has finally done it.  He has put together a movie that actually manages to make the awful original movie that was ripe for parody look desirable by comparison.  Honestly, it couldn't be all that hard to put together a movie that successfully pokes fun at this silly pop culture phenomenon, but he manages to fail at every single moment in this 90-minute so called spoof.  This movie doesn't do anybody any favors, and it unfortunately ends up being one of Florence Henderson's final roles on film for a really limp Graduate reference.  And everything here is just a lame, underwritten gag that doesn't hit, drenched with buffoonery at every single turn.  It is devoid of actual jokes, and this is a movie that doesn't just pick low hanging fruit, it digs up buried and dead fruit up from underground.  All of the jokes are telegraphed, and it either manages to be a bit without a punch line or a random cutaway non sequitur, like \"oh yeah, I remember when Kim Kardashian had that photo shoot\".  At this point, I've reviewed so many of these parody movies (some of which he has previously had involvement in) that they all just blur together.  From A Haunted House 2 to Superfast!, almost all of them are brain-dead, and they are comedies in name only.  This is not an exception to the rule, and I have no idea why you would even take the time with this, unless you're a masochistic movie reviewer that watches everything like me.  This really is so racially offensive that Wayans manages to set his entire race back by a couple of decades, and I am not just saying that for dramatic effect.  There's an entire bit about whips that he chooses from famous slavery movies, and it isn't funny or clever, it is just sad and filled with cringes.  The movie as a whole is flabbergasting, gross, homophobic and tactless, there's something here that will offend every single race and creed.  The most disappointing part is that I know this man has talent and I've seen him act well in projects before, so it makes it all the more depressing that he spends his days making terrible trash like this.",

Honestly, this has to be one of the hardest films I have ever sat through. \n\nThe film centers around a very complex and overall diffcult relationship between African American millionaire Christian Black and usually unnoticed Hannah Steele, mainly because Christian is into BDSM. \n\nThe whole entire film is very racist, sexist, crude, uncomfortable, unfunny, and boring. I really expected Marlon Wayans to be rather funny and overall GOOD in this film, and at least be better than he was in his last production, \"A Haunted House 2\". But really, he's just the same: unfunny. And the real thing I'm worried about is that he actually thinks the stuff that he is doing and saying and portraying in these films are funny. But if you have seen his recent films, you can tell by now he's just not funny or interesting anymore. \n\nThe film started off promising and of course stupid, but in a rather funny way. That was only the first 2 minutes. After that, I had to take off my headphones because some of the things they were saying were things I really didn't want to hear. Yeah, this film is that bad. It's so bad that I gave up watching at about 1 hour and 15 minutes into the film. \n\nIf your expecting something rather funny and enjoyable, you won't get it here. This is defiantly the worst film that Waynes has ever been in. Hugely dissapointing, and unwatchable basically through the whole thing.",

I did not see that movie or read the book but I know enough about it to figure out what the real deal was. The story line focused mainly on the extremely unorthodox sexual nature between two individuals and it was kicked up a notch with beyond hilarious additions that only enhanced the complete feel of the movie. At every corner there were jokes that surrounded current pop culture situations which brought the entire outlook of the film to life. From the very start there was no fore playing around. The production team lubed up every scenario and maneuvered their way nice and easy into our hearts with each passing successful scene. This is certainly a \"Must See.\" There was a familiarity with the way the final product was displayed but it also had a new vibe of swagger that felt all new to the game. The moments that the entire theater was not on a roller coaster ride of laughs were when the true substances of the film showed its genuine colors and they sure were bright. Without a doubt lines were for sure tested and almost crossed but the just far enough concept of the entire movie was what kept our eyes glued to the BIG screen with high anticipation of curiosity to what in the world is next. Brilliant insanity is another way to describe what I just willingly viewed. Still to this point my mind is replaying scene after epic scene so to help categorize everything that happened. Even through that, it was good but not great. Awesome but not to the MAX! And for those slight downplays it receives a very sturdy standing of \"3 Stars.\" A truly fun night at the movies. Seriously one of the most unique ones I have EVER had and for that main reason, \"it is all good in the hood.\" YEAH!",

How can you successfully make fun of a pop culture phenomenon that in itself is already one big joke? This is a nearly scene-by-scene recap of the movie version of \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\" It's like a group of giggling 16 year old boys sat in a room, watched the original movie and came up with their own lame gags. Sadly, most of the antics and wisecracks are borderline dreadful.\n\nI'm not saying there's nothing to like here. There's the always charming Marlon Wayans and a fun homage performance from Kali Hawk. There are more than a few surprisingly original, very funny jokes that made me laugh out loud. Jane Seymour, as Christian's clueless stepmother, delivers some of the best material in the movie. The funniest jokes are the ones that poke fun at racism and the s&m / sexism that bubbles over in the original story. At least they weren't lazy and tried to write good jokes. But none of these highlights can save the mean-spirited, clunky attempts at humor.\n\nThis movie isn't nearly as bad as you think it would be, but save your money and wait to rent it on dvd.\n\nMATT SAYS:\n\nSpoof movies usually suck. And not just a little. A lot. The worst are those awful Seltzer / Friedberg reference movie collaborations, like \"Disaster Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans.\" The Wayans brothers, however, consistently make better parody movies than pretty much everyone else. Not that they're great (they usually aren't), but the writing is pretty much always better than your average spoof. \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is no exception.\n\nNot that \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is a good movie, exactly... it isn't. But it is watchable, which is saying something for a movie like this one. There are some good jokes here, and most of them are not completely lazy. Some actual thought went into writing the script.\n\nThe problem with any parody is that it helps when the film being spoofed was been good in the first place. This is particularly true where, as with \"Fifty Shades of Black,\" the storyline pretty much follows the original. If the original story wasn't that interesting, the spoof usually won't be, either. It's hard to keep an audience's attention when the story itself is dull.\n\nThe filmmakers did the most they could with boring source material, and managed to squeeze some pretty good laughs out of it. That's still not enough, however, to make the movie one to recommend.\n\nA SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW",

But that isn't it at all!  The jokes come thick and fast, and if you are not alert, you will probably miss some of them. You have to be paying attention.This was one of the better and faster-paced movies made as a satire. In the showing I attended, I would say the audience was laughing at least every 30 -60 seconds.

It made you laugh, it was fun. The part where Hannah's friend beat up Christian with excellent Gongfu skills outside the bar, the part where Christian's spanking never worked, and the part where the two chose to communicate in a black way rather than using an emotion-squeezing method. \n2. It beat the sad, sick ending of Fifty Shades of Grey.\nThink about it, was it really a good ending when a girl as innocent and easy-going as Anastasia had to fall in love with a perfect Grey who clings to his personal issues and then had to leave the elevator and say goodbye? \nHowever, in Fifty Shades of Black, the female character successfully got Christian to spill out his childhood miseries and convinced him to work on his issues, though the two were arguing and fighting, but they made it work, eventually! Which is hopeful and nice! \nWho would you choose to be? If you were Anna or Hannah?",

In the bland tradition of Date Movie, Superhero Movie, and Meet the Spartans comes Fifty Shades of Black, a one (and a half) note send up of the one-note film spawned from E.L. James' one-note novels. Granted, taking aim at bottom-feeders allows for a ripe proving ground of comedy because these low denominators are unintentionally funny to begin with. Unfortunately, Black aims just as low as it intended victim, trying to wring easy laughs out of material that accidentally ended up to be funny in the source material. If some pointed jokes about race and sex didn't at least hit just inside the dartboard, Fifty Shades of Black wouldn't even rank one (and a half) star. In regards to skewing pop culture, Black is - simply put - whack.\n\nIn this R-rated spoof, an inexperienced college student meets a wealthy businessman whose sexual practices put a strain on their relationship. \n\nNot much was expected of the Wayans's parodic oeuvre, mind you. With Dance Flick and Haunted House having already grabbed very low hanging fruit (think: strip mining topsoil) off of other genres rather than play it straight with clever dialogue a la Airplane! or The Naked Gun, this gratuitous exercise follows in very much the same small footsteps. The leads make the most out of cheap shots but some cameos from Fred Willard, Jane Seymour, and - wait for it - Florence Henderson make for the funniest exchanges. \n\nBottom line: Meh in Black",

            "content": "You would think with all the accumulated earnings the Wayans brothers, Shawn and Marlon, have obtained after being on Television and in films for years that they would invest their money and their time in projects that would be a bit more thoughtful and entertaining. Instead, ever since the runaway success of \"A Haunted House\" in 2013, the two, particularly Marlon, have been keen on making movies that fit the bill for the lowest common denominator of entertainment. \"Fifty Shades of Black,\" a horribly obvious and persistently unfunny array of cheapshots at the erotic novel/film series that is already too easy to joke about, continues Marlon's streak and incredible failing to make something out of his Baby Way Productions company. \n\nI've always found it interesting that while Tyler Perry's films are anything but consistent, and there are about an equal number of bad films in his catalog as good films, he often gets blamed for making films about black people that cater to the lowest common denominator and showcase them in a negative light, yet the recent collaborations of Marlon Wayans and Michael Tiddes go pretty much unscathed. These are films that evoke some of the most putrid and ugly stereotypes about nearly every race and, for that matter, exist simply as unapologetically crude and contrived projects that do nothing but attempt to evoke laughs based on brand-recognition. These films are just a slight notch above the dreaded works of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.\n\nAs hinted, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is a parody of \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" and it takes pretty much the safest, most convenient route to parody the film by making the jokes largely centered around the absurdity of BDSM and its culture, race and ethnic humor, the ordinariness and \"ugliness\" of its lead female character, and the enigma surrounding its titular character, who in this case, is Christian Black (Marlon Wayans). Christian is a multi-millionaire mogul who begins a sexual relationship with his new intern, Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk) and what entails is a relationship filled with sex, sexual violence, and downright bizarre encounters.\n\nWhile whatever Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison gang is cooking up this year is likely to get plenty of Razzie nominations, Marlon Wayans and his cast of familiar faces such as Affion Crockett, Missi Pyle, Mike Epps, Fred Willard, and more should be looking at the same award. It's incredibly rare to see a cast ostensibly operate on auto-pilot and look like the end product bearing some essence of quality is the furthest thing from their minds, but perhaps given the lazy screenwriting of Rick Alvarez and Wayans himself, this was to be expected. \n\nShockingly enough, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" offers more laughs than both of the \"Haunted House\" films put together, especially during a sequence that parodies one of last year's Best Picture contenders at the Academy Awards. However, in order to get to this sequence, one has to succumb to the drudgery of enough racial and bathroom humor - so much that it gives Laura Mulvey's concept of \"phallocentrism\" a whole different angle to explore - that it ultimately isn't worth sitting through the amount of trivial nonsense to get to that particular scene.\n\nWe're not even in February yet and this year has already been incredibly interesting for comedies. After seeing \"Ride Along 2,\" I didn't think many more comedies of the year would get much worse than that. Then I saw \"Dirty Grandpa\" the following week and I thought the same thing; there was most likely the weakest comedy of 2016 that I would have to sit through. Now, almost exactly a week later, I've seen \"Fifty Shades of Black,\" and if this isn't the worst comedy of 2016, I seriously fear what I have to endure in the coming eleven months.",

            "content": "The Wayans Family has created quite an entertainment dynasty over the past three decades or so. Long before anyone had heard of Tyler Perry, the Wayans Brothers, as most people refer to them, started creating big and small screen entertainment that catered to the African-American audience. The Wayans brought us the sketch comedy show \"In Living Color\" (1990-1994) which, in turn, helped launch the careers of Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx and David Alan Grier, among others, as well as films like \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\" (1988), \"Major Payne\" (1995) and the \"Scary Movie\" horror film parodies (2000-2013).\n\nThe Wayans are mostly known for their parodies. 2016 adds another one to the list with Marlon, the youngest of the original \"Wayans Brothers\", co-writing and starring in \"Fifty Shades of Black\" (R, 1:31). Most will immediately recognize that this film is a take-off on 2015's very successful film adaptation of the book \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". Like most of the Wayans' films, pop culture and movie references abound, but \"Fifty Shades of Black\" duplicates much of the plot of the film that inspired its comedy. You'll see what I mean in the following plot summary (which, by the way, is necessarily risqué).\n\nHannah Steele (Kali Hawk) is an attractive and intelligent college senior in Washington State who fills in for her sick roommate, Kateesha (Jenny Zigrino) in interviewing billionaire business magnate Christian Black (Marlon Wayans) for the college newspaper. Hannah gets flustered in the presence of this sophisticated, supremely-confident and mysterious man. Christian is quite taken with Hannah - and take her is what he soon decides he wants to do. He shows up at the hardware store where she works, takes her out to coffee and even comes to \"rescue\" her when she drunk dials him from a bar. Despite how obvious it is to the main characters and to the audience that these two are very, very different - and despite the title character's own conflicted resistance - these two cannot resist each other. But Christian very clearly states, \"I don't do romance.\" That doesn't stop Hannah from being drawn to this man.\n\nAs Hannah discovers more about the cipher that is Christian, she learns that he is wounded - both emotionally and physically - by his childhood. She seems to want to comfort this man who acts as if he needs no comforting and begins to love this man who tells her that he is only interested in her for sex. Being the woman in Christian Black's life means submitting completely - sexually and otherwise - to his whims. As he eases her towards an understanding and acceptance of his lifestyle, she has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, he convinces her to have sex (actually \"f--- hard\", as he describes it) and then shows her his \"playroom.\" This usually locked room is painted dark red, has a bed and is filled with various restraining devices and implements of sadomasochistic sex play. Hannah is shocked, but not necessarily repulsed. Christian presents his contract which describes Hannah's role as his submissive.\n\nI just did something I've never done before (or even been remotely able to do) in a movie review. The previous two paragraphs are actually cut and pasted from my 2015 review of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\"! Using the \"find/replace\" function in Microsoft Word, I changed the names of the characters and the actors playing them to match those in \"Fifty Shades of Black\" and I shortened the summary, but I did not add or change anything else. (You can scroll down our timeline to my \"Grey\" review to see for yourself.)  \n\nBut rest assured there's plenty in \"Black\" besides just recreating and making fun of scenes from \"Grey\". \"Fifty Shades of Black\" also seamlessly incorporates Wayans-esque versions of scenes from such movies as \"Whiplash\" and \"Magic Mike\". There are also references to a plethora of other popular movies, TV shows and books, plus a generous helping of pop culture satire and some politics. This is the kind of film which is so fresh, it feels like it was written a month before its release, but that means that its humor (and perhaps its appeal) will quickly become dated. Of course, there's also plenty of racial humor, much of it stemming from white actors Jane Seymour and Fred Willard playing the title character's parents.\n\nLike much of the Wayans' work, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is very funny in spots, but those spots are small and spread out. The few clever/amusing jokes and sight gags and even fewer laugh-out-loud moments seem adrift in a sea of gross-out humor and over-the-top acting which is often not that funny. Still, most Wayans fans will probably enjoy the film and those who've only seen a little of their work may find this one good enough for a mild recommendation. \"B-\"",

            "content": "\"That's right folks, getting mauled by the bear from \"The Revenant\" would be more comfortable than sitting through Fifty Shades of Black\"\nDVD Movie Review: Fifty Shades of Black\nDate Viewed: April 20 2016\nDirected By Michael Tiddes (A Haunted House and A Haunted House 2)\nWritten By Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez\nStarring: Marlon Wayans, Kali Hawk, Jane Seymour, Fred Willard, Affion Crockett, Mike Epps, Florence Henderson, Mircea Monroe, Kate Miner, King Bach and Dave Sheridan.\n\nWhich of these three options suits you better? Getting mauled by the bear from \"The Revenant\"? Going out on a date with Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz? or sitting through \"Fifty Shades of Black\"?. I say getting mauled by the bear because this crass parody of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is nearly unwatchable. Despite having vulgar gags involving semen, long hammers and big balls, the MPAA still gave this movie an R rating. \"Fifty Shades of Black\" should've gotten an X or NC-17 rating because if the entire continent of Europe were forced sit through 90 minutes of agonizing torture, they will probably prosecute the filmmakers for psychological abuse against moviegoing audiences. Who is responsible for this dreadfully unfunny spoof? You guessed it, it's Marlon Wayans, possibly one of civilizations most unfunny comics working today. Wayans along with his co-conspirators, co-writer Rick Alvarez and director Michael Tiddes have created a monstrous cyclone filled with disgusting humor and awful comedic performances.\n\nMarlon, don't you have better projects in mind instead of making more terrible spoof movies? Didn't he realize this genre died while he made the first \"Scary Movie\"? To refresh your memory, that movie also had writing credits for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer who would go on to inflict \"Date Movie\", \"Epic Movie\", \"Meet the Spartans\", \"Disaster Movie\" and \"Vampires Suck\" on intelligent moviegoers. Now Marlon Wayans has gone off to make terrible spoofs on his own without their help. He made the two \"Haunted House\" movies, which weren't any better and \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is just as bad. To nobody's surprise, it wasn't screened for critics on it's opening day because Marlon Wayans always gives the finger to them for hating his movies.\n\n\"Fifty Shades of Black\" tells the exact same story as \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" but with African-Americans in the cast, we follow college student, Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk) who goes for a job interview with wealthy businessman Christian Black (Wayans). He didn't make his money the old fashion way, he made his money through drug dealing and a stint as a male stripper (obviously riffing \"Magic Mike\"). Just when things couldn't get any worse, we meet Christian's brother, Eli Black (Affion Crockett, another Wayans collaborator) who has a \"Weeknd-style\" haircut and a long hammer that can reach the floor, Jane Seymour as Christian's racist adoptive mother who teases Hannah with a taser gun saying \"I'm standing my ground! I'm standing my ground!\" and with Christian replying \"Black Lives Matter\", and in a flashback sequence we meet Florence Henderson doing riffs on \"The Graduate\" and \"Whiplash\" as we see her teach some rhythm  lessons with Wayans. She later says, \"I thought you black guys were all rhythm and have big Ds\". WOW! WOW! WOW! What a comedy this is!\n\nOf course, we get to the S&M scenes and they range from irritating to unfunny to annoying to \"Get me out of this movie!\". In the midst of all this, I ashamed to admit that I laughed once during the whole movie. The joke that I laughed at was when Wayans was reading the actual \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" book as a weapon to torture Hannah, he exclaims, \"who reads this anyway, it's terrible!\". \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is well... How can I say this? All of the above.\nBrutally unfunny, terribly unfunny, dreadfully unfunny, not funny at all, beyond stupid, it's just plain awful.\n\nMaybe it's finally time for Marlon Wayans to switch to Netflix because theatrical spoofs just aren't funny anymore. It was all funny when \"Airplane!\" and \"The Naked Gun\" came to town but now this genre is pretty much dead. I still think \"Dirty Grandpa\" is the most horrific comedy of the year but don't worry \"Fifty Shades of Black\", you'll still show up on my worst of the year list at the end of December.",

Marlon Wayans really commits to his role. Even if the joke doesn't work, he really goes for it. The film is very hit or miss. Sometimes, the jokes land very well. But most of the time, the jokes fail hard. There are a lot of gags that are stretched out too long that aren't funny. Also, the film sometimes deviates from the story just to make more gags. I didn't like that. Also, the film isn't that coherent and doesn't give a good plot. Overall, Fifty Shades of Grey actually gives more laughs than Fifty Shades of Black. That really isn't a good thing. This is an unfunny parody where most of the jokes don't land.",
