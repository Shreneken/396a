I will give credit where credit is due and say that they make the infected look truely grotesque. \n\nBut yeah. this movie was 99 minutes of my life that I will never see again and watching it made me almost feel like I was in Karen's shoes.....painful and begging someone to kill me.",

        {
            "content": "At the point of this movie's release, 14 years had passed between the original movie and its remake.  I think that's just way too short of a time to wait for a remake, to be perfectly honest.  I remember talking, in my Mad Money review, about how, while there are still remakes left and right in Hollywood, they aren't as bad or as prevalent now as they were in the past.  And then, a couple of days after that movie, I end up watching this.  Quite possibly the most unnecessary horror remake in quite some time.  If the idea was to bring the Cabin Fever story to a new generation of horror fans, given that, again, at that point, almost half a decade had passed between movies, then why not just do a re-release of the original.  Which, I'm assuming, has a big cult following and it can be a merging of two different generations of horror fans, those who watched the movie when it first came out (I was a part of that, I was 14 when the original came out) and those who want to experience it for themselves for the first time because they may have been too young to watch it.  That would actually be a pretty cool idea.  Honestly, as much as I've enjoyed some Eli Roth movies, as far as I remember, I wasn't that big of a fan of the original Cabin Fever.  I only watched it the one time in the theaters and I would welcome a re-watch.  The pointof the matter is that this really is an absolutely unnecessary update of the original movie and, quite frankly, it's worse than the original.  I'm honestly surprised that, out of 28 reviews on RottenTomatoes, there was not a single positive one.  Not a one.  No one had anything positive to say about this movie.  I'll be honest, the only other Cabin Fever movie I watched (there's two more, if you weren't aware), was Patient Zero.  I wouldn't go out of my way to say that that was a good movie, but I felt that it had tremendous practical special and make-up effects.  It was really impressive for what, essentially, was a low-budget direct-to-video affair.  Shame they were servicing a movie that was, largely, not very good.  And, if there was only one expectation I came into with this movie, was for it to have quality blood and gore and, honestly, the movie definitely delivered on that.  I don't think the practical effects are ever as gruesome as those in Patient Zero and it feels like to give the appearance that this was a better film than it actually was, but it's still really damn strong.  Watching the flesh-eating virus as it takes effect over our characters is a joy to watch.  The problem, of course, is everything else.  Conceptually, the movie plays out very much like Carpenter's The Thing.  I realize that that's probably the first, and only time, anyone will ever compare this to one of the classics.  What I mean is that the idea of paranoia as a result of the fact that you don't know who has the virus is very similar to The Thing, where this...monster is able to mimic human beings perfectly.  The characters in The Thing don't know who the monster is and that creates mistrust in a very claustrophobic setting, which certainly didn't help matters.  The movie is going for something along those same lines and, well, it just doesn't work.  Problem is just the fact that you never, at any point in time, care about any of these characters.  They are the stereotypical teens going out to a cabin in the forest/woods you've seen time and time again.  And, really, after Cabin in the Woods, you can't just offer this concept up without at least attempting to subvert some of the tropes associated with this set-up, but they don't.  They're very content to play into those tired genre cliches.  The fact of the matter is that the characters in this movie are just really poorly written and quite unlikable.  Bert is an absolutely insufferable character, to the point where his presence actively detracts from the experience.  A lot of the character work just makes no sense.  For example, Bert, when it's apparent that Paul and Karen are becoming an item, starts acting like such a fucking dick.  He berates Paul because he likes Karen because she nice to him and she likes him because she can control him.  And it's like, well, fuck, that escalated quickly.  It came from out of nowhere and was nonsensical because Karen has never, at any point, displayed signs of trying to control Paul.  So it makes Bert's rant absurd, as if they were trying to give me more of a reason to hate him.  Apparently just being himself wasn't enough.  And then there's the whole thing with the infected guy coming up to the cabin and everything that happened and how the characters try to act as if it was an accident, when they were clearly responsible for everything that happened.  This man was looking for help, they denied him that help and so he tried to steal their car.  That's fair enough to me.  So for them to try and play it off like it was self-defense was fucking bullshit, you guys are the real villains here, the virus is the real hero.  Not all heroes wear capes, much less if that hero is a fucking flesh-eating virus.  The movie fails miserably at creating any sort of tension that would lead to the paranoia that comes as a result of the characters not knowing who has the virus and to what extent.  There's a jarring shift where Jeff, who was...tolerable at best, turns into a total rich boy preppy asshole.  It happens out of nowhere, the characters are just arguing and he comes out acting like a total asshole.  I don't know much about cacti, but I know a prick when I see one.  And the sad thing is that the movie relies so much on this when it's just not that good.  It's not interesting and, most of all, it's not entertaining.  The scripting leaves a lot to be desired.  If you want this atmosphere of constant paranoia to work, where nobody knows who they can trust, it works best if you actually have characters that you can somewhat invest in.  Not saying that they have to be super likable, but just characters that you feel can exist within the context of this universe.  Again, they don't have to be likable, you just have to believe in them within the context of the universe.  I didn't believe in any of them here.  They're just poorly written assholes.  Another issue I had is that the score, while good, feels way too intrusive in some scenes and over-the-top for this type of movie.  Going back to the characters being assholes, it's as if the movie realized this because the third act or so, when the horror really cranks up, it's like an entirely different movie.  By this point I feel that it was too late to change anything, but the horror is decent and tense enough.  There is one incredibly stupid moment.  I'm gonna try to avoid spoiling anything, but there comes a point when Paul has to mercy kill one of his friends.  He drives a a shovel into this person's mouth, separating the jaw from the rest of the face.  Somehow, though, this person survives and is actually able to yell at Paul to kill him/her.  Paul, instead of putting a friend out of his/her misery quickly, proceeds to throw gas all over them and set them on fire.  Now, if you were following the movie, throwing gas over these people infected with the virus really fucking burns them.  So Paul, the fucking dumbass, chooses to \"mercy kill\" one of his friends in THE MOST PAINFUL WAY POSSIBLE.  I imagine being burnt alive is the worst way to die even without a flesh eating virus consuming me from the inside out, so can you imagine the pain this person had to have felt.  And this moment is played poignantly, like it's supposed to be fucking sad.  Paul is crying outside in the shed as he watches the smoke come out from it.  This was just really fucking stupid.  How was this a good idea in anyone's mind???  Decent third act aside, this movie is just bad when you get right down to it.  I'm giving it two stars because of the third act and the practical effects.  Other than that, there's nothing to this movie.  Awful characters doing awful things to each other.  I wouldn't recommend it in the slightest.  Not only is this an unnecessary remake, it is an exercise in futility.  Stay away from this.",

One scene in the film struck me as very funny. One of the principles exits a shed to find three \"bad guys.\" The \"hero\" tries to shoot the three with his rifle but it doesn't fire. One of the bad guys says, \"No, you got the safety on.\" The hero looks down, clicks the safety off, and then mows down all three badies. I mean, how stupid do you want to be?!",

There is no new spin on the story, you could probably watch them both side by side and notice very little difference which begs the question, why?  Remakes are only good if the director has put a completely new spin on the story, shot it from a different perspective or made significant changes.

What a waste of time with nothing really redeeming about it.  It was shot using the original script.  Almost a shot for shot remake.  This one had slight changes and different camera work.  This version took all of the funny spots from the original, I guess they were trying to make it more serious.  The acting wasn't good at all in this version.

The original Cabin Fever is one of my all time favorites in part due to its' campy humor. Yet done by a different director with the black comedy pushed aside it still holds up as a genuinely good flick. If you are a regular horror fan than tis one is decent.

So quips the paperboard character of Paul from my latest review (he's played by Samuel Davis)\n\nAnyway, the story of five campers subsiding to a flesh-eating virus, is redone in 2016's unrelieved Cabin Fever. If you've seen 2002's original, here's what's different: There's a dissimilar ending, there's an elaboration on the storyline, the Winston character is now a female, the music from The Shining is used in the opening credits, there is less utilization of a red-hued palate, and there are no bloodied flashbacks. Also, the murderous dog named Dr. Mambo is more frantically portrayed, there is virtually no 80's horror feel, and the characters are more sympathetic (I liked it better in the first flick when they were meaner to each other). Still, this comes off as an almost uniform, cash grab remake with director Travis Z (his real name is Travis Zariwny) not updating this thing with any real sense of style or substance (despite an ominous musical score). He decides to revel in paint-by-numbers filmmaking with his actors/actresses going through the motions as if they were robotic caricatures trying to be Rider Strong, Jordan Ladd, and James DeBello (the troupers from the first movie).\n\nIn truth, Cabin Fever is a midsize, acting effort that's admirable despite a first hour that makes you want to turn the DVD player off (I was almost tempted to by sheer regularity). You pretty much know everything that comes around the corner. Heck, almost every frame is identical with previous helmer Eli Roth coming back to help out by co-writing the screenplay (did I mention that he's a producer as well).\n\nSee the new flick if you're part of a later generation (or if you've never viewed the first Cabin Fever) but know that most of it is a carbon copy of what was screened 14 years ago. That's too short of a wait to redo a film. You gotta let 2002's Cabin Fever breathe a little. Better than 1998's shot-by-shot re-imagining of Psycho but still not recommendable. Rating: 2 stars.",

            "content": "There are times when remaking or reimagining of film is warranted. For stories that are so incredibly well constructed, epitomizing an aspect of the human condition, it is the right of every generation to reinterpret through the vantage point of their own experiences and social sensibilities. Many of the plays of William Shakespeare are perfect examples of this. No one would complain that place such as 'Romeo and Juliet' or 'Hamlet' has been reimagined more times that could easily be counted. Each one edited a different set of nuances, different perspectives that allow the generation to make the work their own expressing what is important to them. Then there are those movies the motivation behind the remake is exceptionally baffling. This is become a trend lately specifically in the horror genre with some of the major franchises have been taken up by a younger director hoping to reinvigorate a fan favorite. In recent years such horror classics as 'Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' , have been reimagined with various levels of success. What is truly mystifying is when a relatively minor horror franchise is subjected to a modernizing revision. In the case of the movie considered here, 'Cabin Fever', the 2002 original was a barely passable beer and pizza flick. It was followed by two sequels was critical and fan appeal diminished with each release. Now will be six years later this film has been remade and after watching it I still have no reasonable explanation for how or why the studio backed this film. The only possible reason is that a 'Master of Horror 'with a proven track record decided to attach himself to the project, you are Eli Roth. He is one of the founding fathers of the torture porn subgenre. His film credits encompass such gruesome franchises as 'Hostel', and of course the 'Cabin Fever' series of movies. One of his most recent films, 'The Green Inferno', is a story of cannibalism greatly influenced by the notoriously deeply disturbed films, 'Cannibal Holocaust'. His recently branched out into television more traditional yet exceptionally intense shows as 'Hemlock Grove ' Fans of traditional horror movie should pray that he doesn't receive the financial means to subject us to another go at the 'Hostel' bloodbaths. If these films used animals as victims, then PETA would be utilizing it for a recruitment campaign.\n\nAs for the setup is concerned it is not fair to say is a direct report from the original movie. That would imply that the original movie had a modicum of originality. He had a group of five changeable characters of recent college graduates who are bored so they decide to head off to a remote cabin in the woods in order to drink, smoke pot and have sex. Need to travel so far away from home to engage in these activities is fairly believable with teenagers. For a group of college graduates one of them should have an apartment where least someplace closer than they can find some privacy. I was a teenager in Brooklyn New York all of these activities were readily performed without having so much to spend a single subway token to say nothing of having to travel into some deserted woodland. The archetypes used to define the five characters are direct from central casting including the requisite young woman capable of at least a modicum of reasonable thought, Marcy (Nadine Crocker), the contrasting girl was frequently found taking selfies, Karen (Gage Golightly), two main male leads, Marcy 's boyfriend Jeff (Matthew Daddario) and Paul (Samuel Davis) was trying to get out of the friend zone with Karen. Of course there is a need for a fifth wheel was supposed to provide some comic relief, Bert (Dustin Ingram). These are exactly the same names used in the previous incarnation of this film. At the very least he could've come up with different names or perhaps have will be more ethnically diverse. The biggest change in the film and the casting choice made for the local authority figure, Deputy Winston previously played by Giuseppe Andrews but now by recasting the role as a woman the character was taken up by Louise Linton.\n\nYou are so many places we a bit of imagination by the been able to creep into the script which was credited to Randy Pearlstein. He could've selected a different vector to initiate the spread of the infection rather than sticking with the dog and old man. Mr. Pearlstein does have some interesting credits however. He was the voice of several characters for the short-lived animated show on Comedy Central, 'The Americans' and appeared in several sketch comedy shows most notably single quote Chappelle's Show'. Previous to this film he was the screenwriter for both the original 'Cabin Fever' and 'Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever'. Hopefully he doesn't happen to have an 'alternative 'screenplay for that sequel lying somewhere around his home. The request for all concerned that the infection stopped with this film. The director, Travis Zariwny, who chose to be credited here as Travis Z, has a resume that is predominantly short films. Unless all the circumstances it might be pertinent to state that currently has difficulty in maintaining a longer film that would be making the assumption that the longer movie contains a story that requires a it's running length to properly relate to the audience.\n\nJust the only changes made 2002's attempt to the gross effects quotient. If you thoroughly pretty young woman in the bathtub shaving her legs was disgusting as the skin began to peel off, the effect of the virus in this film is far more devastating, particularly on the audience it has to watch it. I have come to the conclusion that the only one who did appreciate the special effects for the people who received special effects in order to come up with various delivery systems for several hundred gallons of fake blood that was required for this movie. There's one thing that can make seeds in a horror movie that rely solely on this very disturbing imagery it would be pulled morning the scenes fall beyond any necessity. You might think that the scenes just seem longer but if you take the time to compare the duration with the previous film see that they are indeed significantly longer. Come to think of it, it's pretty bad to start thinking about metric analysis during a horror film.\n\nWhat is unusual is Mr. Roth's willingness to actively participate in this do-over. Since the screenwriter remained the same Roth received a secondary writing credit and was listed among the traditionally long list of executive producers. it is not unheard of for this credit to be used to credit people involved in some way with the project. A number of filmmakers have achieved a degree of name recognition. They are able to permit the use of their name in marketing as a form of branding. No matter how you try to put a positive spin on this flick anyone other than a diehard Eli Roth completest will choose to watch something else",

            "content": "The Cabin Fever remake is a huge improvement over Eli Roth's awful 2002 original in many ways and it is the best in the Cabin Fever franchise since the recently released prequel Cabin Fever Patient Zero. If you've watched the original Cabin Fever and you love Roth's original then this movie is not for you since its the same movie with the same plot and it is also using the exact same script with a series of changes in terms of dialogue, execution and tone. But if you watched the original and hate Eli Roth's original and is hoping for a new Cabin Fever movie either a remake, sequel or prequel whatever etc.... Then this movie is for you. The plot of this film is like the 2002 original which is about a group of College kids who are spending their vacation at a cabin in the woods, where soon after they kill an infected hermit. One of them starts to get the same disease as the Hermit and it is now up to them to try to find a way to save their sick friend or die trying. I really love this movie and I don't care if some people call this a shot for shot remake because it is using the exact same script with a series of changes in everything. But in my honest opinion I love this movie a lot more than Eli Roth's awful original because there are many reasons why I love this movie over the original. One of the reasons why I consider this to be a major improvement over the original Cabin Fever its because first of all I love how the tone was completely changed, right after I heard about a Cabin Fever remake in development I was really surprised with the idea despite that Cabin Fever Outbreak the second prequel to the original Cabin Fever was scrapped/canceled. I had so many hopes when I watched this film because I truly hate the original Cabin Fever(but at least the Unrated Director's Cut is more watchable than the theatrical version) the remake was able to really put adrenaline in the film itself and I love how the humor was removed in this movie and was replaced with a more serious and darker tone. Because in my honest opinion this is what the original Cabin Fever could have been in the first place and the humor in the awful original really ruined the overall look of the film which also is by the way the result of the bad acting by the way. Second the casting and character development are a miles better than in the awful original. Ok I admit that in the original the acting ranges from good to bad. In the original there were some outstanding performances throughout the first half. But the second half seriously destroyed the overall image of the film due to the mixing of humor with Horror and it was also responsible for the bad acting of the casts and the characters became unlikable throughout the film after the impressive first half. Here the acting is way better from start to finish and the casting is ten times better than in the original and I love the way Deputy Winston is a woman in this movie than in the original since Giuseppe Andrews was good in the original and was the comic relief in both the first movie and its first sequel. Here Deputy Winston is a woman who looks very attractive, sexy, smart and tough at the same time and she's more serious than comical like her male counterpart in the original which is in my opinion very good for a change and it works for a remake and I also love how the hillbillies in the original were replaced with Rednecks instead plus I love how the stupidest scene in the original which is the pancakes scene where Dennis bites one of the characters and do karate chops in front of the characters before biting was cut in this movie and the character of Dennis is creepier than in the original and last but not least. This movie is more intense and shocking than the original because the remake was able to seriously create more tension than the awful original. If you guys haven't noticed in the original the tension is gone in the next half of the film after the intense first half. Plus the remake's atmosphere is very mystic looking which I really enjoy in this movie. But what I like about the Cabin Fever remake is that this movie is packed with loads of scenes that are way more intense and creepier than in the original(The creepy sequence where Dennis wears a bunny mask while holding a teddy bear, the scene where you get to see Dr. Mambo bark and harass the group and the dog is way more terrifying in this movie than in the original and the sequence where Dennis bites Bert and gets chased by the rednecks plus the scene where Paul gets attacked by the Hermit was so intense) but the film's gore effects are the main highlights of this film and the kills are even bloodier, more disturbing and gorier than in the original and the death scenes are seriously super bloody and pure gross(Karen vomiting loads of blood, the infected Hermit showing his body rotting which is super gross, the infamous leg shaving sequence which was in the original and is more unflinching in this movie, the super bloody shovel shove to the mouth and several scenes where the characters start to see their skin fall apart as the disease consumes their body) plus I also love the soundtrack composed by Cabin Fever Patient Zero composer Kevin Riepl and the soundtrack is grittier and a bit more grounded and on the edge than his dark, powerful and synthetic score for Cabin Fever Patient Zero and it creates a very dark and gritty tone which is perfect for this film. Now the acting is seriously the best in this film. The performances of the casts in this film is seriously way better than in the awful original. Everyone in this movie did a very good job with their performances in this film and the personality and chemistry of each of the characters is way better than in the original at some point which is pretty true. Director Travis Zarwiny did an amazing job with his work on this movie than what Eli Roth did for his film back in 2002. In my honest opinion I would watch this again because this film is ten times way better than the awful original and Travis Zarwiny was able to put some impressive changes that really fits well for this film and the changes were completely necessary in my honest opinion and he seriously did a better job modifying Randy Pearlstein and Eli Roth's script with several changes. Overall this new Cabin Fever remake seriously surpassed the original in many ways and it is a miles better than the original. This movie is more entertaining and shocking and gorier than the awful Eli Roth original. This movie gets a 10/10.",

            "content": "Even though it's a pointless remake, I have to admit this surprised me! Cabin Fever follows the original very closely with some scenes looking the exact same, as well as the dialogue. If I remember correctly, I read somewhere that the director of this remake used the script Eli Roth wrote for the original movie. Anyways, the movie follows five students going on a vacation in a cabin in the woods. Once there, a sick, bloody man comes to their cabin and asks for help. They all think he's infected and want nothing to do with him. So they burn him. And before you know it, they're getting infected one by one and trying to find out what's causing it and how to stop it. It's not a really great or mind-blowing story, but it's entertaining and interesting. As I said, the movie is the same as the original, so watching this movie is quite pointless if you've seen the original, but I will say that the gore and violence looks better in this movie. There's also more of it. It's still not a scary movie, though. The acting is okay. The characters are okay, they all serve their purpose in the movie, but as expected they're aren't really developed that much for you to care for them. The direction, I thought, was great! The locations looked really cool and there were some really nice shots in this movie. The soundtrack is good, as well. Though I did notice that at a few times the soundtrack would be so loud, you could barely hear the characters talk. The ending is great. The entire last half an hour is great, to be honest. Since I really like the original, I can't say I don't really like this because it's more or less the same movie. Same story. All in all, albeit pointless, Cabin Fever does offer some awesome gore moments with a good soundtrack and great direction. I would recommend this movie to the fans of the original, to those who haven't seen the original, but are interested in this movie, go watch the original first.",
