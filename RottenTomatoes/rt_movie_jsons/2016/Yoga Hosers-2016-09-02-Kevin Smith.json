When you build a universe that's wild and cringe you're going to tend to be just as outlandish when extending that universe. \n\nDid people not expect a goofy, slap stick, weird, cringe movie after watching someone turn someone else into a fucking Walrus? \n\nSometimes people need to remember to not take things so god damn seriously! To me, this movie was a breath of fresh air that reeks of weed.",

The script is cringe, the acting is so bad, the editing is out of place and lazy, etc, etc. I cannot believe they dragged Stan Lee into this god awful movie. The only redeeming aspect of this film is Johnny Depp's performance, to no one's surprise. Nonetheless, this movie is just the Smiths and Depps sucking each other off to get their friends and family some spotlight lmao. Also, the \"insta cams\" completely ruin the flow of the scene ever. single. time. I hate them!!!",

Apparently, Kevin Smith and Johnny Depp took their families on vacation, and for fun, shot a movie while ridiculing Canadians?  And not just with a camcorder - like with somewhat decent production values and some special effects.  If you are in on the joke, I bet it is funny as heck.  If you are watching from the outside - huh?",

It does have its charm and the leads are both likeable and do a fantastic job investing you into the nonsense of the movie itself.  Not my favourite Kevin Smith movie but it's growing on me.",

Perhaps the worst part of this whole ordeal is the fact that Kevin smith, of Clerks fame apparently wrote this and then allowed himself a credit rather than using a pseudonym. Smith has reached his nadir with this joke of a movie which isn't just unfunny but less than stupid.\nI dare any cinephile to watch this the whole way through as a matter of gauging just how much visual and auditory torture they can endure",
