It expands the Star Wars lore to explain why the Death Star has that strange weakness, gives us an amazing Gold Squad Cameo, as well as great action sequences. \nAbsolutely recommend\n\n\nIt's so hard to understand how this movie could be made by the same company as The Force Awakens.",

            "content": "I give this movie 4.5/5 stars for its thrilling story, its stunning visuals, and its respectful homage to the Star Wars legacy. It is a film that expands the Star Wars lore and adds new layers of depth and complexity to the conflict between the Rebellion and the Empire. The film also features some of the best action scenes in the franchise, especially the climactic battle on Scarif. The film also showcases some impressive performances from its diverse cast, especially Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso, Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, and Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic. The film also pays tribute to the original trilogy with some clever references, cameos, and easter eggs.\n\nHowever, I also think that some aspects of the film are slightly flawed, such as the pacing, the characterization, and the music. The film sometimes feels rushed and uneven, especially in the first act. The film also struggles to develop some of its characters and make them memorable and relatable. The film also lacks some of the iconic musical themes by John Williams that are synonymous with Star Wars. The film also relies too much on CGI for some of its characters and scenes, which can be distracting and uncanny at times. Nevertheless, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is an excellent addition to the Star Wars franchise and a thrilling standalone adventure that fans and newcomers alike can enjoy.",

This is much darker with more of an adult feel than other movies in the franchise.  Having said that, it has its humorous parts that are dropped in at just the right spot and are not juvenile or goofy.  The best thing about the movie is the extent to which it draws you into the world of the Rebellion's espionage.  That part of the movie is tense, and feels real with real consequences.

Many blogs and websites have essays and videos dedicated to analyzing the director's choices and exploring the richness of characters' development. THIS episode encapsulates the very best of all the films and leaves out much of the low-hanging fan service the more recent films have relied upon for box. office success. THIS film is rarely pandering and though many plot choices are dubious in their motivations and execution, it's more of a structural necessity than mere demand for a suspension of disbelief. Felicity Jones as Jan Erso is delicate but fierce, vulnerable but straightforward, and believable beyond all expectations. With the backup of heavy hitting veterans like Diego Luna, Mads Mikkelsen,Forest Whitaker and Alan Tudyk, Jones perpetuates the protagonist heroine into the resolve of the movie's climax quite perfectly. The cinematography (obviously largely CGI-driven) is impressive in its detail,  but restrained to not be over produced for the sake of being spectacular. The sound design was extremely enveloping overall and made sure precision was executed in the editing. ADR was barely noticeable (that's a good thing) and the film editing was nothing short of perfect- no continuity or storytelling snafus that I noticed after multiple screenings, and with so many choices, everything felt alive and correctly transitory. This will likely remain the grandest and most consumable chronicle of the Star Wars cinematic universe.",

I heard this film was recommended, even to non-Star Wars fans, however, so I decided to give it a go. Its certainly not a bad film - its reasonably tense and atmospheric at times and it is somewhat gripping as well, with good chase scenes. There's a decent cast present too, including Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen, among others. Its pretty entertaining and I thought the special effects were well done but its very much a sci-fi film and the plot is somewhat complicated. I'm pretty s ure you can enjoy it, even if you don't pay much attention to every last plot point, however. Its not the sort of film I think I'd want to watch again but its certainly a good film and so I'd say its worth seeing if it interests you, or if your a sci-fi fan, then yes I would recommend it.  I can think of worse ways to spend a little over 2 hours, though it isn't exactly greatly meaningful or memorable, its definitely not bad either and does a good job of keeping the viewer entertained, even if said viewer may not be entirely sure of everything going on. Sometimes escapism is all thats needed in a film, especially these days.",

It felt like the writers didn't feel there was a need to flesh these characters out hardly at all because they all suffer the same fate but that isn't an excuse for lazy writing. And because of that that is why the acting also feels like its nothing special either. The actors aren't given much to work with except be likeable and accouple of quirks that are I guess meant to substitute for personality. Acting and the Characters were the main problems I had with this consistently. And it really starts to weigh the longer things go on. But still every other element is very well done especially a very well done action packed ending. This is a classic of its franchise and if your a fan of Star wars you'll like it it is definitely worth at least one viewing but this isn't anywhere near the quality of the original trilogy because of the lack of rich characters.",

Even small wins, like opening the shields, felt so significant in this movie and for the first time, the feeling of dread and terror was ever presence.  The cast/characters - particularly in the second half of this film - were so likeable because of their arcs and genuine bravery.  There was no plot armor, no character was safe from demise, yet, they sacrificed everything for information that gave them nothing more than a mere chance of survival.  The closing Vadar scene also culminated the quality of cast and story.  The extras who played the Rebels put in such an incredible performance during that final scene.  The feeling of sheer horror when Vadar's lightsaber shone was totally unlike anything I'd felt while watching a movie.  The \"LAUNCH\" scream from one the rebels highlighted how terrifying and evil Vadar had become.  It also gave 'A New Hope' so much more meaning which is quite a feat.  They HAD to succeed in their mission after the Rebels gave up their own lives to get the Death Star plans.  Jyn was perfectly cast and an example of how to write a strong female character.  She was so easy to like, her script was brilliant and she was the consummate hero.  Jyn was arguably the most important \"side story\" (for lack of a better term) in all of Star Wars.

The Easter Eggs make the universe feel small and ruin the idea that this is hundreds of planets with trillions of beings.

We see the stakes are high when near the 1 hour 30 minutes make we see many people sacrifice their lives to get the Death Star plan. Really, I find it quite sad seeing all those rebels die for such a good cause \u2014 try to take down the deadly weapon by getting the plans for it. Granted, this is just a movie, but also I feel the stakes are higher particularly in this film. I really don't know why; maybe it is because we see so many rebels dies or maybe because the whole mission was set out by not many people, I really don't know. But I feel the stakes in this movie the most out of all the other Star Wars film. This one is good because it can manage to do a spin-off Star Wars story but manage to keep it somehow consisted to the Skywalker Legacy! It probably could have been its own Star Wars movie but maybe it was for the best! I also like this because it did not exactly give a happy ending \u2014 it was in fact more than happy, it was quite sad truth be told. It manages to balance out the action, drama, sadness, and a good storyline which is what a movie should be: it should balance everything out! Granted, this is not the best Star Wars movie (well technically it is a spin-off movie to the series) and I kind of wished John William's amazing score would have been in here: it would have been added half a star if John William's score was in here. It is such a creative movie with bright visuals and great cinematography, and glad to see Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin come back to this film \u2014 with of course C-3PO and R2-D2, how could we miss on them!! Overall a great movie to see and to be honest a great spin-off movie to the Star Wars series!",

The cast is brilliant, but I wish their characters had been able to do more. The scene where Darth Vader slices his way down the hallway makes me terribly emotional because it's so brutal, dark, and cruelly violent, but I feel like it gets played off like it's supposed to be cool, and everyone talks about how awesome that moment is, which is far from how I feel about it. I don't like the mentality that the villain of the story brutally slaughtering innocent good guys is what makes the film \"awesome\". In the end, it's not worth it to watch a whole 2 hour film for a 60 second hallway scene. Even still, I will always appreciate this being canon and I will always appreciate having seen it.

I had a great time when I first saw this film in December 2016. Is this a prequel that prepares us for Episode IV: A New Hope, and does it succeed? Yes, I would say. This film introduces several new characters, and my favourite is K-2SO, who is essentially a black skinny C-3PO. I really like Director Krennic, who is played by Ben Mendelsohn, who is known for playing villains. The character moments were enjoyable, and we know a little about them. My favourite aspect of this film is that it features Darth Vader, the most renowned Star Wars villain. Warning: This film contains spoilers. My favourite scene is when we first encounter Darth Vader at his palace on Mustafar. This time, instead of John Williams, Michael Giacchino is in charge of the music, and he did a fantastic job. I still listen to the music now and then, and the visuals are fantastic. When the star destroyers collide to destroy the shield, the final fight is epic and takes place in space. Since the end of Return of the Jedi, the ending is arguably the greatest I've ever seen in a Star Wars film; in my view, it's the best finish in all of cinema! But Rogue One's ending was great; when Darth Vader becomes a badass and we see Princess Leia, it ushers us into Episode IV. A fantastic picture, and one of the finest of the year.",

I like the arc that Cassian Andor goes through in this movie. Donnie Yen was amazing as Chirrut \u00cemwe in the movie, and Jiang Wen's final scene as Baze was moving. K-2SO was funny. Director Krennic was a nasty son of a cur in the movie, but he was a good villain. It was incredible to see Tarkin in the movie. Plus, Darth Vader's final scene against the Rebel soldiers was both horrifying and amazing. It's just a great Star Wars story. It's the best Star Wars film that Disney produced. Unlike the mess that was the Sequel Trilogy, this movie is as good as the original films from 1977, 1980, and 1983.",

I can't remember and she can't act. She has no range or emotion \u2014 she's just stiff with botox, and the bad guy, Mr Croconut was just a sad paper character. The movie was filmed twice (now trending for Star Wars Stories) and the cinematography suffers horribly from chronic SHAKY CAMERA SYNDROME, completely departing from the brand's cinematic feel. The story is a thorough mess that jumps from disconnected scene to scene, conflicting exceptional art direction against a quagmire of poor film directing \u2014 perhaps a steady cam emulator, a calm editor, and the omission of bad acting could revise this film into a better product, but for now just save yourself the agony of enduring this flop and watch the very fun space battle (without the ground fight) on YouTube.",

            "content": "Rogue One is interesting for me. It's quite the unbalanced movie, where most of the characters are rather uninteresting until the final third of the movie. In fact, much of the movie just passes over okay for the first two thirds. Certainly not bad, but nothing special either aside from some cool bits of worldbuilding (the death troopers and U-Wing are pretty awesome). But this is all made up for with the climax, which is easily one of the best finales in Star Wars history. It's like going from a 5 to a 10 in full whiplash. The battle of Scarif is  so epic with its action-packed skirmishes and it really puts the \"War\" in Star Wars. The tension builds as the characters are picked off one by one and the rebel alliance rushes in with all their cavalry as they finally step out of the shadows to defy the empire. And that final hallway scene with Darth Vader was epically haunting. He's more like a force of nature that you can't kill, but only escape from. But as epic as the conclusion is, the meandering first two thirds of the movie kind of drag it down for me. I'd be more forgiving if they made the lead character Jyn more interesting. They should've made her feel like a real rogue, like Cara Dune or a female Han Solo. Instead she spends most of the time with her head down, saying he lines quietly and often being overshadowed by her male co-stars. The worst example being when Cassian explodes at her for daring to be angry that her father died indirectly because of his actions. His defense that he's \"been in this fight since I was six years old\" is such a laughably contrived Freudian excuse that comes out of nowhere and has little to do with the argument. Especially when considering how Jyn's been in this fight since she was nine years old, except she was abandoned and left to fend for herself on the streets. And this is  never brought up! A character with such a harsh upbringing should feel more assertive rough around the edges, but instead she comes across like a frail mopey teenager that always looks constipated. The writing and direction surrounding her character felt low-key sexist to me. But I guess being a cynical rogue with a heart of gold is only cool when men do it. Many of the other characters are either bland or too over-the-top. The cameos are sometimes exciting, and other times feel so contrived and random. The only character I really stuck out to me was K2-S0, the snarky security droid. He easily had the best dialogue and was cracking me up.  So overall, I'd say this movie was quite the mixed bag for me. But the lows aren't too low and the highs are high enough to bump my score up to a 7/10, even if the highs are mostly just blatant fanservice. But I'm a Star wars fan at heart, so it touched the inner child in me that just wanted to watch starships and space wizards.",

The action is also done very well in this, and the worldbuilding is still very spectacular. About the only bad thing I can really think about this film is that there is quite a number of instances of fan service, though I think that this film handles it better than most other films do. Jones, Luna, Mendelsohn, Yen, and Tudyk are some of the better actors that really give it their all in this film. The humor is also very well and lands a majority of the time.

This movie took a risk by dispensing with the orthodox Star Wars formula by not being focused on the Skywalkers, and instead introducing a new set of main characters who all died at the end. The risk paid off. A change in pace from the normal style of Star Wars films worked well. It was nice to watch a Star Wars film without countless scenes about the force and pompous Jedi preaching. Instead we had an intertaining action film which expanded the lore of the Star Wars universe in an interesting and exciting way. The final Battle of Scarif was very well executed, with an epic space battle and a satisfying and unorthodox ending. My only issue with this film is the character of Cassian who was supposed to evoke some sort of false-equivalency between the empire and the rebellion with his stories of committing unforgivable war crimes for the rebellion. This might be a good point regarding conflicts in the real world, and it might have worked in Star Wars but it was awkwardly executed and unbelievable considering the very black and white perspective we get on good and evil in other Star Wars films.",

            "content": "What may have seemed at first glance like a tangential addition to the Star Wars universe- if not a cynical and superfluous money grab by new owners Disney- cements itself firmly by the final credits as an indispensable chapter in the Star Wars canon. Rogue One begins with a reasonably compelling story of conscience, rebellion, and family devotion, then courses through scrappy internal rebel politics, escapes and reunions. By the time it arrives at the familiar plot points, set pieces and characters that fans of the saga love, it becomes a white knuckle kamikaze about sacrifice for the greater good. And just when you get the lump out of your throat from the emotional impact of what just happened, the film jerks you back upright with an unexpected one-two punch. For what feels like the first time in a 40 year saga, we see what is arguably the best Darth Vader scene in the Star Wars universe- an edge of your seat look at how singularly dangerous and devastating one of the most iconic villains in cinema really is. Finally, capping off the darkest chapter in the Star Wars saga since The Empire Strikes Back, Rogue One brings things full circle by flickering a light of nostalgia and hope (okay, and fan service) that places it seamlessly into the lore literally moments from the beginning of A New Hope. Rogue One serves up drama, tragedy, loss, triumph, action, and last but not least, a tasteful seasoning of light hearted laughs without (and this is important) the price tag of any insufferably cringey or corny character(s) delivering it. It isn\u2019t a perfect film (the first half can be a bit slow at points), but it\u2019s damn good\u2026and easily in the top 3 best Star Wars films yet. If only the prequel and sequel \u201cEpisodes\u201d had been this good.",

The only thing I knew about this movie is the Darth Vader scene, and I thought if it has that scene, it must be having plenty such scenes. Turns out that scene is to this movie what Flash and Superman's slow motion fight is to Josstice League: The only one good scene in the entire movie. Most of this movie is just talking, talking and more talking.\nI won't complain about it though. I didn't know the \"We were on the verge of greatness\" meme was from this. I used to think that meme is about an agriculture scientist from Discovery telling how his experiment failed. So subsequently the \"Are we blind? Deploy the troops!\" meme also had to be from here, another one I didn't know where it was from. I ended up liking K2SO, he was my favourite character from the movie. I felt really bad seeing him die.\nThe action scenes of this movie are very good, now that I think back about it, especially the one with the blind Jedi. The scene where a droid that looked like H2SO gets shot and then the actual H2SO comes from the back saying, \"I hope you knew it was not me.\" was hilarious. But that's the only scene I remember, other than the Darth Vader scene of course. Most of the scenes from this movie are very forgettable. Out of the over 2 hour of runtime, I only remember barely 2 minutes from it combined.\nI don't see the point behind the making of this movie. It just answers a question nobody asked. I wasn't even paying attention because I was waiting for the Darth Vader scene, as I had begun thinking it isn't in this movie until the very end. I could definitely give it a rewatch whenever I get a Disney+ Hotstar connection, but that's really far from today.",

Visuals are really good though. Riz Ahmed & Whittaker are by far the best performances. Both lead actor/actors (Jones & Luna) are average at best. Another problem of mine with this movie is, that they are really trying to do a lot of story-telling, but they fail to keep me invested in it. One scene I actually liked is the Jyn speech in the council, by far the best acting from Jones. The finish is more Star Wars-like and features some really solid action.

I had a blast rewatching this. I first think I should talk about the problem most people have with it. That the characters aren't devoloped, but the thing is that it's not supposed to make you very well attacthed to the characters and its more of telling what really happened, from that one single opening title line in A new hope. The basic premis of this movie sounds great! And thanks to great directing and a good screenwriter, it made in my opinion, the best disney star wars movie. The actors do well with what they are given and have great timing, subtlety and display the faith in there characters. My biggest problem though with the movie, is that they make a lot of these characters and give the main character and her love interest a character, but not the rest which didn't make too much sense. There are times where I couldn't really follow through and the pacing could be a bit slow from time to time. I also didn't like how they put relationships in characters and gave some characters some personality and others not and just to throw it away really bothered me.

It never majorly affected my viewing experience, but I could feel it slightly dragging here and there. I also didn't like the cast on anything more than a neutral/standard level.\n\nFelicity Jones does an admirable job in the lead role, I did like how they set her story up at the beginning. I also found any scene with Mads Mikkelsen good to watch, while Riz Ahmed and Forest Whitaker are solid; Alan Tudyk is OK as well. Diego Luna and Ben Mendelsohn, however, didn't do anything for me.\n\nThe story itself is satisfactory, the ending to it is more meaningful than I was expecting and features a few nice shots; the whole film looks lovely in fairness. I personally would've shaved 10-20 minutes off the run time and got more devilish antagonists, though.\n\nStill, it's at the very least a good film no doubt.",

A well-received movie visually speaking. However, there are some wasted storylines such as why is Galen Erso so vital to the Death Star being completed? What's the story behind Saw Gerrera? Why did he leave the Alliance? That point is brought up by the movie writers that his tactics and actions caused problems for the Alliance leadership, but it is never addressed. Forrest Whittaker's performance as Gerrera seems wasted. Great seeing Vader but was his scene with Krennic needed? What was gained by it? Ultimately what is Krennic trying to accomplish in the end? Get control of the Death Star back from Tarkin? When the movie was over, I felt like I had \"checked a box\" in regards to saying I had watched the movie.

The characters are also actually pretty ok contrary to popular belief. I find Jyn to be a pretty tragic and interesting character and you really feel for them. They're just trying to do the right thing and even though we knew what was going to happen, I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie wondering how the hell are they going to make it out of the situation and I love how Disney took a risk and made them all die, making for a really emotional ending and that Vader scene is everything I wanted. Rogue One does drag in a couple of places (should have been 10 minutes shorter) and while the characters are ok, they are generally unmemorable and there's way too many of them but it's still a great movie (A-)",

Not the West End Games one either. You know how they go, someone always has to play a martial artist.\n\nIt's one of those frustratingly bad films where you've got competent actors, the visuals are certainly of acceptable quality and your brain is just sitting there rewriting the film as you watch it to be way more interesting. Entire plot threads are just left laying on the ground unused in favor of some random cameo of characters from 30 years ago. As a for instance towards the beginning of the film a character witness the death of their mother as a child at the hands of the forces of the antagonist. This isn't brought up again in the whole film, not even when those characters meet again in the climactic confrontation. It's basically that for 2 hours.\n\nPersonal opinion it's an easy pass for watching. Probably the worst Star Wars film and not in the Star Trek 5 kind of way where there's still an, \"We are our pain\" scene or something in it to reward the brave.",

            "content": "Admittedly, as someone that grew up with the original Star Wars Trilogy, one was a little skeptical hearing the news George Lucas had sold the rights to his space opera to Disney. The Mouse House did a fine job with The Force Awakens (2017). However, it was a gold-mine of callbacks, narratively mirroring A New Hope (1977). Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was something new and refreshing. A part of the chapter fans had only heard brief snippets of. Finally, we were going to see the group of rebels that risked their lives for the blueprints of the Death Star.\n\nOne thing I loved about Rogue One is the characters are slightly different to usual noble Jedi and smugglers we're used to seeing. These are the grunts relegated to the background in the Saga franchise. Felicity Jones (The Theory Of Everything) does a solid job as Jyn Erso. She's emotionally engaging and contains the rebellious spirit of Luke Skywalker. Diego Luna (Narcos: Mexico) is equally watchable and heroic as Cassian. The captain of Rogue One starship and secondary hero of the feature. The central trio is completed by K-2SO, brought to sardonic life by Alan Tudyk (I, Robot). K-2SO is undoubtedly the highlight. The reprogrammed Imperial droid is far more entertaining than C-3PO, R2-D2, and BB-8. Also, one would be lying if seeing Peter Cushing (Dracula) and a young Carrie Fisher on the big screen for one last hurrah didn't bring a tear to my eye.\n\nDirector Darren Edwards (Godzilla) succeeds at the daunting task of creating new characters and settings while putting together a captivating story. The new worlds we visit are vividly realised, with some beautiful cinematography to enhance their authenticity. While variations of familiar characters such as the all-black Deathtroopers create their own iconography. His use of the Death Star will leave one shaken. The grand scale of its power is fully utilised, creating a sense of dread as it looms over neighbouring planets. The final battle on the planet Scariff combines the most iconic moments of the originals. From rebel starships causing Star Destroyers to crash in to one another, to AT-AT walkers duking it out with rebels on a beach. The finale easily trumps all of Disney's entrances to the Skywalker Saga, bringing a dark and uncertain tone to its conflict. Resulting in one of the most powerful conclusions in the franchise. Rogue One bravely foes down a similar route to The Empire Strikes Back (1980), finishing on a minor key. It is an all-out war movie, and the sacrifices of the characters hammer home the significance of the battle they've fought.\n\nAlthough Rogue One begins with the familiar \"A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far Far Away\u2026\",  and the signature pan across a starfield. It's clear from the opening moments this is going to be a different kind of Star Wars story. It's a gritty, boots-to-the-floor war picture that often feels like a WWII or Vietnam war movie. Edwards succeeded where the prequels failed and creates one of the best Star Wars movies since Irvin Kershner's entrant. Rogue One is a thrilling cinematic experience that feels genuine and authentic to the Star Wars lore. Whilst simultaneously working as a stand-alone feature.",

The plot was very clever and actually adds context and significance to the plot of Episode IV. Unlike the Sequel Trilogy, which truly harmed the story developed in previous sagas, this movie made the Original Trilogy even better by showing you what the Rebels endured to obtain the Death Star Plans.\n\n*SPOILERS*\nAnd the idea that the flaw in the Death Star was deliberately added by someone who knew participated in the project knowing that it would be completed by someone else anyway was masterful. Having him take advantage of the confidence and trust that the Empire had in his abilities by joining the project only to sabotage it was very interesting and very clever. And this is not to mention how he must have felt, knowing that there was every chance that his exposure of the flaw would go undiscovered, and that the Death Star might go around spreading death and misery across the galaxy, never to be stopped.\n\nThe tragic ending for all of the characters also made this film a great segway between the Prequels (which were about tragedy) and the Original Saga (which was about hope). The balance between tragedy and hope is absolutely perfect in this film.\n\nSo, minor flaws aside, this is a great film, and worthy of being called 'Star Wars'.",

Darth Vader was awesome in this movie. But the CGI was awful when it came to resurrecting dead actors or making Leia young again. I will never understand why people praise the CGI on Tarkin or Leia. Leia\u2019s face didn\u2019t look right; she didn\u2019t capture Carrie Fisher\u2019s likeness, and her eyes seemed unfocused, glassy, and dead. Tarkin unfortunately looked like a video game character. When I saw this movie in theaters, I was only a casual fan and didn\u2019t know the actor was dead. I remember seeing Tarkin on screen and wondering why his skin was so rubbery and weird. If someone who doesn\u2019t know that the actor is dead (because people who knew he was dead can convince themselves it\u2019s fake anyway) can tell that something is wrong, they should fix the CGI.

All of which turn out to be normal people without The Force (a first in the movie series). This direct prequel to \"IV A New Hope\", is everything we wanted out of that plot, and more. It really improves the original film by adding new layers of depth to it.\n\nFirst, because it bothers to explain the political background of the original film, and even more impressive it manages to keep it simple, without over-explaining it. Then, it also layers of gray morality, whom add new depth to the Saga as a whole. Like \"The Last Jedi\", this films dares to question the heroes of Original Trilogy  and the Prequels, it doesn't santify them and that's why this movie is great. These people who stole the Death Star plans, all turn out to be the most flawed persons, simply looking for redemption\n\nThe Darth Vader hallway scene where he kills 30 trained rebel soldiers seems written to criticize how Kylo Ren couldn't even beat 2 untrained kids in \"VII: The Force Awakens- A New Hope the remake\".\n\nI like how the villian Krennic is a secondary villian aspiring to be a main villian. The whole reviving of Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin by CGi is weird to think about, but is really respectfully done. And enhances the character. I also really like how by the end of the film, Jyn Erso and company realize that they aren't the main characters, and they are fine with it.\n\nBringing the animated tertiary character Saw Herrera into live-action, and elevating him into a main character was such an inspired and nerdy choice. The people doing this movie really have nerd cred. Because they saw beyond the films, that's what puts Rogue One above the lazy JJ Abrams remakes, whom can't even come up with something that wasn't a remake.",

This weak story is kind of saved by the fact that it opens up many doors to new possibilities. Now, characters and minor side stories could get their own films.

This movie made me like A New Hope even more and explained a plot whole on why the death star was so easily destroyed. I like that idea of Galen giving information out to the Rebels so they can destroy the Death Star and his death was emotional. \nCons: The first two acts are very boring. Some of the characters in this movie like Gyn and Cassian are some of the least interesting characters in this franchise. Some of those were some pretty big problems for me. Grand Moff Tarkin doesn't have good CGI for him and Chronic as a villain felt a bit bland. \n\nI still like this movie a lot even though the first two acts took a lot away from this movie.

What Rogue One is to the Star Wars universe it show us that you don't need some enormous, painted costumed council, braveheart style gigantic war scenes, goofy back stories, and silly love scenes to be an epic story within an epic saga. It is a dark tale of suffering and sacrifice that doesn't end well for anyone in the movie that you have heard of before. And that is what makes it excellent. It has real impact and depth upon a surface skin we all recognize. it shows you that it's not all fun and games, and it deserves praise for being exactly that.

The Mandalorian is the only exception to that notion except that it's a television show, and equally excellent to the original 3 and Rogue One. If you haven't seen it yet, do so.

Every time I want this film I am just completely amazed the cast of characters he brought together to complete this mission. As well there are as many that you just have to fall in love with. I believe Gareth Edwards really gets the Star Wars universe and is by far the best Star Wars movie director Disney has used thus far.",

I absolutely loved the third act of this movie. Some of the best space battles and action sequences in all of Star Wars. I didn't give it 5 stars because the first third of the movie is boring in my opinion. It's to slow and cuts around so much that it's a bit convoluted. Still, it's pretty great and each act builds on the other and ends strongly. It's a great Star Wars story.",

I believe that all of the performers as well as the writer and the director have a passion driven understanding of what it is to be part of the Star Wars Universe. There was no silliness or bad one liner jokes. Any and all of the humor was well placed and written in to the folds of the story line dialogue, and the story line itself ties in a perfect and seamless manner to the rest of the saga.  I have respect and appreciation for those both in front of and behind the camera that can honor what the essence and nature of a movie saga is without incorporating their own so called twist to it which would ultimately be corrosive to and change the feel of the story to those of us that have been on this ride for almost 40 years now. It is drama driven, gritty, suspenseful, endearing, and above all else, it is true to its roots. Five Big Stars.",
