            "content": "I wanted so hard to love this movie, and for the first half I did.  I cried at all the right places, and thought that the modern framework they built to have the aviator recount his story was well done... it reminds us that the call to childhood of St-Ex is universal. \n\nSo then I discovered when the story ended that there were still some 40 minutes left to go... but why should this be?  And here is where everything went off the rails for my enjoyment: the little girl takes off into space to find that the business man has become some great existential threat consuming the galaxy.  The screenwriters apparently thought that this would be a good addition to the narrative, perhaps because they had no respect for Antoine's works.  In the world of St Ex, the beureaucrat is not someone to be feared.  Rather the \"adults\" of the narrative are prisoners themselves, trapped by false idols of \"adulthood\" that make their lives ultimately hollow and unfulfilling.  In the world of St Ex, the businessman is not to be feared, but rather to be pitied... he could have been mozart, but instead huddles over his account statements worried about numbers on a piece of paper.  \n\nMake no mistake, Tonio did see a threat of the commercial nature of the world, but it was not a fear of the businessman, but rather a fear of the thing that made the businessman what he was in the first place.  The desire to be seen as serious, the materialism of consumers, the growing banality of choices that people are left making, and so on.  The directors lose this in their anti-capitalist, anti-corporation messaging because they embody the threat of a hollow life in an external being.  That's the failure, because the threat of shallow adulthood isn't from discreet entities: it is universal and it comes for us all.  \n\nThe screenwriters believed they could add their brand of modern view to St Ex's work, and in the attempt managed to tear down the very message and warning that the book gives to us.  Watch the movie, but the second you start to wonder why it hasn't ended, turn it off.",

It's undeniably charming, touching, and with excellent characters. The real problem of The Little Prince 2015 version is the story outside The Little Prince's universe. I know that the falsely perfect atmosphere and the little girl and his mother without personality are purposeful things, but they're constantly removing me from that joyful atmosphere which I was always hoping to return. The aviator was a character who I learned to like throughout the movie, he started a little creepy but ended in a way as charming and touching as the story he was telling to the little girl. The third act is the best part, despite also being problematic. It starts thrilling, funny, and with excellent references to some characters from The Little Prince. But there's a new character (who was a brilliant idea) who makes that act return to the boring rhythm of the rest of the movie. At least, it ends well.",

A multi-layered, extremely compelling, and enriching exploration of adulthood and what it is to 'grow up', and a failure of imagination in the grown-up world, that also gives such enlightened insights into the imagination, creativity, hope and compassion we all hold within us  from a young age. Appealing to both children and adults, it is a wonderous animation, with a stylisation that really shows you how much the creative team loved the book this is based on. Not going to lie, it had me puzzled a few times, but the wonderment and awe always ease you into its next 'passage'. I truly love how it encourages us to connect with older generations, and to feed that one-of-a-kind Rose slowly dying inside of all of us...",

I hate the way these people live their lives, so systematic like robots. That little world that she stumbles across when flying the airplane was so well done. I love how she comes in contact with the characters from the Little Prince story but in the \"real world\". Like the conceited man, played by Ricky Gervais, the king in the elevator and the business man. Crushing stars in order to make energy for your dystopian society. What a crazy concept. \n\nThat whole scene of the freeing of the stars from the giant glass dome and the plane flying up into the cosmos with them was so beautiful. I actually cried lol. Part of life is being able to say goodbye but also knowing that the person will always be a part of your life as well even after death. \n\nBeautifully animated. I love the paper textured art. This movie shows us that it's things like greed, vanity, jealousy and pride that turn people into soulless and unimaginative adults. Never lose your sense of wonder and imagination, what it means to feel like a kid. So funny how it's the old man showing her how to feel like a kid again, what it feels like to live. The music was fantastic! It actually made me tear up during some moments because how beautifully it complemented the scene. \n\nReally heartfelt movie that hits deep in its messages about growing up and becoming an adult. Also clever and smart in its writing and storytelling. Fairly deep and sentimental for a kids movie, and I love that. Kids need to be challenged that way. I thought this was a fantastically beautiful tale and I would recommend it to anyone. Definitely something I would want to show my kids. I will be watching this one again.",

            "content": "I haven't read the book this film takes it's inspiration from, but from what I could basically gather the stop-motion sequences are fairly accurate to the original story, but the framing device with the CGI little girl and old man are entirely new.  The stop-motion sequences are all great.  First of all, they look beautiful, and have an eerie hypnotic quality to them.  Their storytelling is kind of in the form of fables, and highly symbolic, but the messages are timeless.  The framing device for the most part works well.  I take slight issue with it because it does work towards grounding a lot of the fables in a concrete world, and I don't know if that's really necessary.  I think kids are smarter than we give them credit for, and we don't need to put it in a world they relate to completely to make the story work.  That being said, it's a longer story now, and since they are doing it this way they do at least do it well.  The parallels work, and they never make it too modern.  It's very clearly in a world more resembling ours than the magical realism of The Little Prince's world, but there's no forced pop culture references or overly wacky comedy a la a bad Dr. Seuss film.  The climax is where I do start to take a bit of issue though.  For one, I thought the film went a little too long.  It's not even that long, but it doesn't need to be, and at the point when I was ready for it to start wrapping up I realized there was 40 minutes left because it had to take a really weird detour that doesn't totally work.  But even the parts that don't work too well aren't that bad, they're just not as good as the rest.  Because the rest of it is so good.  The stories of the Little Prince are all beautiful, and the framing device of the old man and girl and their strange friendship is genuinely touching.  It's a great film, not perfect, but still great.  It has a strong message of holding onto childhood that did get to me a little bit, and there's plenty of other sparks of truth sprinkled throughout that will be effective for kids and adults.",

I honestly can't imagine the movie with other actors in place.\n\nMy big problem with this one is that this is actually the 3rd part of a 3 part story that just happens to reference back to the first parts in a attempt to faux multi thread and drip feed information.  Don't get me wrong, it does build a certain amount of intrigue, but it's one of the problems with \"The Lorax\", the audience is installed, just give us the story, you don't have to break it up.\n\nMy other problem is that my biggest problem isn't enough to keep me complaining.  It's a touching movie about keeping a certain amount of freedom and passion in your life, and while it is necessary to meet requirements, they can't always be the only thing that matters.",

The Little Prince has become one of my favorite movies to date. And even though there are some things in the movie that dont necessarily match with the book, the film was nonetheless inspiring, moving, and magical. Through its use of beautiful imagery, nostalgic and taught lessons, the director of The Little Prince, was able to successfully portray a story and bring it to life for people of all ages to enjoy.  \nThis film not only reminded me of what it was like to be a child but also what I missed about being a little kid. It reminded me of the ways in which I used to play, jump, run, and dance around all day without caring what other people were doing or thinking.The movie reminded me of the carefree and happy thoughts and actions I used to carry out, because of the fact that as a kid, I had no worries in the world. Life was overall great when I was young, and this movie brought back so many of those memories I made when I was a toddler. \n\tMark Osborne did an excellent job of captivating scenes that were both beautiful and deep. The movie obviously used many pictures from the book but it did it in such a successful way that it appeared as if the book itself had come to life. The characters personality seemed to flow from the book as the colorful images captured the essence of the story and immersed the viewer in a world full of magic and adventure. For example, in the scene where The Little Prince and the little girl find the wilted rose on his home planet after releasing and freeing the stars, the darkness and dullness that surrounds them on planet B612, depicts the lonely, cold, melancholy, and dead feeling that engulfed the rose and planet when The Little Prince left. When the rose came back to life, the bright oranges, pinks, and red tones in the scene and background demonstrated the warmth and life returning to The Little Princes rose. \n\tNot only did I enjoy this film because of its beautiful scenes, but also because of the important lessons viewers of all ages learned as the scenes progressed. The idea of growing up is one the strongest themes that is presented throughout the novel and the film. The little girl, who is convinced her whole life can be planned out like a map, has a maturity older than most kids her age. She feels like she has to act like a grown-up because everyone else around wants that for her, even her own mother. And this was not just for her but for every child in the movie. Being childish is frowned upon, but throughout her journey in the story, the little girl is able to find and truly discover what a childs life should be like. \n\tOverall it was a great movie, and its one of the few movies I dont get tired of watching over and over again. Yes, there were many factors left out from the book, but it did not take away from the story and the beautiful images and scenes that made this movie a wonderful one to watch.",

Paul Rudd (Mr. Prince), Mackenzie Foy (Little Girl), Jeff Bridges (Aviator), James Franco (Fox), Benicio del Toro (Snake), Marion Cottiliard (Rose), Rachel McAdams (Mother), and many others are all great here. The film works as a strong adaptation of the source material, staying true and still doing enough to be unique. It's a touching story that has plenty of emotion packed into it. What truly makes this stand out is the animation. There are several different types used throughout and all are beautifully done. It's truly stunning.\n\nWeaknesses: The second half or so of the movie feels kind of disjointed. The plotlines are separated from the real world and that of the story being told, but it still could've been meshed together better. The parallels of the Little Girl's projected all work/no play life and the world the Little Prince grows up in make sense, but are super on the nose and that makes it feel a bit cheesy. Some characters come off as clich\u00e9 and unlikable (Mother) or kind of creepy (Aviator) even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nOverall: Thanks to the combination of a heartfelt theme, a wonderful voice cast, and fantastic animation, the Little Prince overcomes some issues to provide you with a highly enjoyable viewing.",

            "content": "- Once upon a time, there was A Little Prince -\n\nIt's hard for me when I remember I'm a grown up now.\n\nI vote, pay bills, and file taxes. I plan meals, grocery shop, and cook. When I move to a new place, I have to find a new doctor and dentist by myself (no matter how much I protest). I have to do these things to survive, so I learn them and accept them without too much fuss. But I have always been a little afraid of being \"a grown up.\" Of forgetting what it feels like to be a child.\n\nThankfully, there are stories like The Little Prince.\n\n\"Once upon a time, there was a little Prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely bigger than himself, and who had need of a friend.\"\n\nThese words are familiar to many of us who grew up reading Le Petit Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, either the French original or one of the over 250 translations published around the world. Since 1943, its whimsical illustrations and deeply profound words have influenced kids and grown ups all over the world. And finally we have a modern major motion picture celebrating its legacy.\n\nIn this new version, we first meet a super-smart little girl (Mackenzie Foy, Interstellar) whose straight-laced mother (Rachel McAdams, Spotlight, Midnight in Paris) lives and breathes to create success in her daughter's life. I'm talking, class A helicopter parent-magnified by a total absence of Dad, who apparently just sends an obligatory snow globe every year on his daughter's birthday.\n\nWe're then introduced to an eccentric, elderly aviator (Jeff Bridges, The Giver, True Grit) next door who bursts into their life (quite literally) and introduces the little girl to his memories of a little Prince-a child, like herself, in need of a friend.\n\nAs the story goes on, the lines between reality and imagination blur. Friendship grows and arguments explode and the girl lets go of her mother's expectations to pursue something greater-though she isn't sure what. Buzzing in her head remains the the little yellow-haired, scarf-wearing Prince. Is he still out there, somewhere? Is he still a child and full of the wisdom that only children possess?\n\nThe film does a fine job of weaving in some of the most memorable, poignant moments from the original novella.\n\nLike the Rose, who shows me that love can transform the most commonplace of creatures into something truly unique.\n\nLike the Prince, who reminds me that love lives forever in my heart and memory, no matter what changes, ages, or dies.\n\nLike the Aviator, who shows me that growing up is not the problem: forgetting is.\n\nThe Little Prince is a beautiful blend of a classic story and a new, compelling one. The animation is absolutely arresting, full of light, shadows, and the aura of wonder. It's the sort of movie where stars hang from threads, and you can almost hear them laughing.\n\nI think what makes it most compelling, as its own story and as an adaptation, is the honesty with which it tackles both childhood and adulthood. Being an adult is not the perfect state, but neither is being a child. (We can't help which we are, after all.) But we begin to drift apart, we begin to lose each other, when we forget to be awestruck. When we put tasks and lists and self-interest above sacrifice, friendship, and vulnerability.\n\n\"It is only with heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.\"\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/the-little-prince, and was written Debbie Holloway.

The 3 different film effects differentiate the stories within the story and are all expressive and magnificent in its use of imagery. Some of the most memorable lessons are: remember to find joy in the simple things in life like we did as young children, common objects and people can become unique if you make it so, and not letting your own fears get in the way of your children's experiences. If you have made many sacrifices for wealth, have raised children, or have lost loved ones, this film can be very moving.",
