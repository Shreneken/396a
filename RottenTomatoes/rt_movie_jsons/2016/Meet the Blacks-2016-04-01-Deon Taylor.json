I like Mike Epps as an actor; he's got a certain bit of charm in his performances, even though he never landed himself a role that pushed him to true leading man status. \u00a0He also knows how to improvise, and while this movie suffers when it is being obtuse and racially offensive, it does work with offhanded comments that you can tell was made up on the spot. \u00a0I did get some laughs out of this, and they almost all came from mutterings dished out underneath the breath of Mike Epps. \u00a0It is kind of bizarre to see this, just because I don't know who out there would have thought that this was a good idea. \u00a0There just isn't a demand for it, and I am surprised that anybody ended up seeing this at all, which is probably why it popped up on Netflix streaming so quickly.  This isn't the bottom of the barrel, but it certainly isn't good. \u00a0It's actually way funnier at the beginning when it does play in the humor that is based on stereotypes. \u00a0Meet the Blacks does nothing but lose steam as it goes on, and it really gets bad when it just turns into the movie that it's parodying. \u00a0I don't know how much you remember about the 2013 film, but it has some truly awful lighting; you can hardly get scared because you can't tell what is going on. \u00a0The same can be said with Meet the Blacks, except there are cynical jokes thrown into the mix. \u00a0Add in some pretty random C-list cameos and you have a movie that flounders more than entertains.",

            "content": "Look, I know I've said this before, and will continue to say this as long as spoof films are being made, but this genre has been dead since the 90s after the last Naked Gun movie was released.  But I'm not even talking about the Naked Gun types, that made fun of old school cop show tropes and cliches.  I'm talking about the more specific type of spoofs, where they go after a specific movie or various movies.  I don't think there has been a spoof of this type in YEARS that has actually been good.  I guess you could say Black Dynamite is the only one, but again, that spoofs the blaxploitation film genre as a whole and not a specific movie.  To me, the best spoofs work because there's a level of respect for the material that you are poking fun at.  Like, as I just mentioned, Black Dynamite or Young Frankenstein.  Both of those films, while poking fun at the silliness of their chosen target to spoof, are also very much loving tributes to the films that inspired them to make the spoof in the first place.  And I think that's definitely something to that that needs to be said.  The best spoofs are those that make fun, but also find a way to show their love and appreciation.  I think that's part of why I find the Seltzer/Friedberg spoofs (Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans) are some of the worst spoofs in existence.  Hell, they're not just the worst spoofs in existence, they're some of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The point of those flicks is to be as dumb as humanly possible without actually putting in any effort into actual decent comedy.  Which brings us to Meet the Blacks.  I can honestly understand the way that this movie approached its parodying of the Purge film series.  Unlike Young Frankenstein or even Black Dynamite, the fact of the matter is that the Purge aren't classic movies.  The first one wasn't that good to begin with, but the last two were actually fun genre movies.  So I can understand the film not being a loving tribute to the Purge movies, because those movie just aren't classics.  Particularly not so close to the film actually being released.  But, honestly, this is a terrible movie no matter how you look at it.  When the best thing about it is how great Zulay Henao looks, then you know that the movie doesn't offer much in the way of quality.  Don't get me wrong, though, there's some good ideas here.  I like the fact that everyone that Carl fucked over before he left Chicago is now attempting to purge him.  From his ex, to people he owes money to, to the president of the Home Owners' Association that sold him the house without knowing that he was a black man, yes, to the drug dealer that he stole money and weed from, even the KKK shows up.  Fucking everybody comes after Carl and I liked that concept.  I liked the concept because it pretty much allows the movie to throw just about everything they can out there, no matter how ridiculous or absurd.  So I applaud the film's attempts at absurdity, to keep things from ever getting too stale.  The problems the film has certainly aren't related to the fact that it's a dull movie.  It's anything but.  The problems come in the fact that the jokes in the movie are just no fucking good whatsoever.  The jokes are so fucking bad.  Not to say there aren't some scenes that made me chuckle, but, by and large, 8 out of 10 jokes are misses.  And the 2 that are hits aren't even that good anyway.  Part of the problem is the fact that Mike Epps is a terrible actor.  Just fucking terrible.  I have no idea how he is a stand-up comic, but he almost has to be better, but let's just say that he hasn't made the transition as smoothly as others like Kevin Hart or even Hannibal Buress, albeit in smaller roles.  The fact that we're asked to believe Mike Epps can believably carry a movie on his own, even one as this that's all about the absurdities and not necessarily about actual acting talent, is more difficult to believe than the fact that this universe got to a point where crime was legal for just one night.  That's how bad Mike Epps is in this movie.  Either that or he just didn't give a fuck and he was just doing this movie for the paycheck, which is also very possible.  Nobody in the cast is really that good to begin with, but Mike Epps is on another level of bad.  Like I said, there's some good ideas here and there, but the movie just wastes them with some of the worst jokes you will see all year.  Now that I really think about it, this might actually be one of the worst movies I've seen all year.  It's really that fucking bad.  Not recommended at all.",

In the past they had hits such as Don't Be A Menace and the Scary Movie franchise (at least the first few films) but with films like Meet The Blacks being released it becomes very clear that this genre needs to completely die for quite some time.\n\nFollowing Carl Black and his family after moving out of Chicago into a nice part of Beverly Hills in a attempt to be safer just so happens to fall on the night of the annual purge, where all crime is legal for 12 hours, Carl soon finds out that old enemies as well as new ones are coming to settle everything little thing in his life.\n\nNow basing a entire film off the premise of the first Purge movie (where they are stuck in the house, not the more open world ones) is a tough call, let alone making a good story and in the case of a spoof making sure it's comical. Now Meet The Blacks does none of this right. Towards the end I felt they were just adding side stories and sub plots on top of sub plots as some sort of cruel joke to the viewer. For a story that from the start was already a entirely disengaging one that left me not caring about it in the slightest by the end I was just glad to not have to think about it anymore.\n\nYou'd hope at least the film would be humorous in some aspects. From nonstop pop culture references, name dropping just to name drop, horrible cameos, and the large amount of racist and profanity laced jokes I honestly can say I didn't find myself laughing once. Coming from someone as well that is very lenient on comedy and can laugh at most was almost a award onto itself. As if they comedy aspects weren't bad enough they even try to throw in small portions of what they assume a horror film would have that is just a insult to even the worst horror films.\n\nThe cast couldn't even help as between the actors, characters, and their performances. All the characters are incredibly unlikable, rude, generally mean, and not relateable at all. You have a list of more well known names do cameos that more so just insult themselves and further add into the list of negitives this film has.\n\nIf Mel Brooks saw this movie he would want the spoof genre dead and gone and after seeing Meet The Blacks I agree. Not only will it be one of the worst films released in 2016 but should go down as one of the most painfully unfunny comedies of all time, worst of all is that they actually tried to make it funny too. Don't even bother watching the trailer for this. Just avoid it.\n\n\nScore :\n\n\n0.5/10\n\nhttps://apocalypticdemise.com/2016/07/29/meet-the-blacks-review/",
