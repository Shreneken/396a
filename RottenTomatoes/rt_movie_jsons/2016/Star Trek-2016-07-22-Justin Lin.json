The assault came from Krall (Idris Elba), a lizard-like dictator who derives his energy by sucking the life out of his victims. Krall needs an ancient and valuable artifact that's aboard the badly damaged starship. Left stranded in a rugged wilderness, Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and the rest of the crew must now battle a deadly alien race while trying to find a way off their hostile planet.",

This film does a great job of pushing that notion to the side and producing a great, singular Star Trek film. Yes, there is some added context by watching some of the other projects, but for the most part, this film stands alone.\n\nThe tone of the film is poignant and direct, with a slight depressed feeling throughout. This slower approach is evident from the opening 5 minutes. The costumes are the best of the trilogy, the set design is specific (unique uses of the Enterprise), and the main characters have nice depth.\n\nI thought that the villain was a bit bland, and I would have liked to see some more quests aboard the Enterprise. That being said, it was a worthy entry in the Kelvin timeline.\n\nBest Character: Chekov\nBest Quote: \"As for me, things have started to feel... a little... episodic. The farther out we go, the more I find myself wondering what it is we're trying to accomplish. But if the universe is truly endless, then are we not striving for something forever out of reach?\" - Kirk\nBest Scene: Captain's Log Stardate 2263.2\nBest Piece of Score: \"Logo and Prosper\"\n\nAdditional Note: Rest in Peace Anton.\nAdditional Note 2: I loved that the credits showed the main seven in alphabetical order.\nAdditional Note 3: \"Is that classical music?\"",

The villain, while he looked scarier, was not as menacing, sinister, or interesting as Khan was in the last one, and it seemed like a bit of a stretch with how they wrote his character arc. Also, when the new/old ship they used to get off the planet was falling off of a cliff, why did Sulu wait so long to turn on the engine thrusters until they were so close to hitting the bottom when he could've done it that whole time instead?? Seemed like a cheap thing to do for a thrill, and this movie mostly lacked thrills throughout it. Even when there was a suspenseful and neat sequence with gravity toward the end it didn't feel like enough.\n\nHowever it was still pretty entertaining and held my attention, and some of the humor was done well as well as the introduction of a new character to the crew!",

Now, the reason I like this entry better is because Into Darkness genuinely believed itself to be a deeply intellectual film, while Star Trek Beyond actually revels in its stupidity, like it's the JJ-Star-Trek finally admitting to the fact that it was dumb all along.  And honestly, I vastly prefer a movie that knows it's dumb and does its own thing to a movie that thinks it's a work of genius when it's actually dumber than any self-aware dumb film.  Fortunately, while Beyond's narrative is actually not particularly grand or epic, it is at least very fast moving, full of moments of snappy dialogue, showcases the best acting of the trilogy, and moves at an incredibly brisk pace.  The only real, overwhelming problems that I had were that the villain is so small of a part that he's practically a non-entity altogether, and the way the heroes defeat his superior tech is not only silly, but anticlimactic as well.  But considering the vast, vast improvement that this is over Into Darkness, I came away from this movie a happy guy, as it's dumb, but expertly-crafted dumbness.",

In particular the backstory of the villians lead by Idris Elba makes absolutely no sense at all and everything seems to hinge a s sequence of increasingly improbable coincidences. This is a shame as I thought the reboot series had some initial promise, Pine and Urban made a fun pairing as Kirk and Bones, but unfortunately the subsequent installments just don't seem to have understood what to do with these new iterations of the characters and it now seems likely this will be the last film made with the rebooted cast.",

The action is great, the visual effects are breathtaking, and the villain is one of the better ones in the \"Star Trek\" universe. The acting is also good, with the new characters introduced being welcome additions. My largest issue with not only this film, but with the entire Kelvin trilogy in particular is that it lacks any emotional weight, with characters surviving the impossible. In this movie it becomes more apparent, which is why I think I have a more sour opinion in this one in comparison to the previous two \"Star Trek\" films.

Perhaps the writers were trying to head off criticism that the third movie in the reboot franchise was a bit episodic, but that is what it is. Once again we have to witness the hapless new Enterprise being easily destroyed by enemy ships, this time in its entirety. What follows is an unrealistic plot where the crew is saved by a cliched alien who has conveniently commandeered an abandoned Federation ship that the Enterprise crew are able to miraculously get working again. Why does the Federation spacecraft need to fall vertically from a cliff in order to start the engines? Has any Star Trek movie or TV show previously required a flow of air through the nacelle engines in order to start them? Feels like a pointless out of cannon plot point. A silly chase scene and a zero-g punch up between Kirk and the bad guy and the movie is all over. I enjoyed the popcorn more.",

Beyond looks to improve on the big ol box of predictable that Star Trek Into Darkness was and let me tell you straight away that they deliver!\n\nThis go round, the crew of the Enterprise steps away from the bridge to bring about the away mission of all away missions. I really enjoyed what they did here by showing a unique and interesting Star Trek story and putting it in an unfamiliar setting. Simon Peg and Karl Urban are perfect fish out of water here as Scotty and Dr. McCoy as is newcomer Sofia Boutella who plays the rebel badass Jaylah with a stunning intensity and a dry humor that really made me enjoy watching her. Watching the crew fight to stay alive on inhospitable terrain with limited resources really reminded me of why I liked these characters to begin with which I feel was something that was lacking in the last film. The story was really well thought out and the action was innovative and well shot making my overall theater experience very enjoyable.

The villain was doing WAY too much, he's a life-sucking lizard who has thousands of henchmen but it turns out they're actually robots easily confused by music and he's actually a human, but wait he looks like a lizard again now? Why does he want to kill starfleet? Apparently he was a former captain but that doesn't explain his animosity ...so what's going on? It was all explained so poorly that I was confused the entire time. I managed to piece it together post-mortem from wikipedia but just felt so baffled that the movie was trying to portray all that and did it so poorly.\n\nKirk is his usual \"every single choice is wrong yet somehow people praise him by the end\" self. The doctor and engineer exist, I guess. Spock and his former girlfriend looked like they might have a character arc for a moment, but nah, apparently not. I think the new girl with white skin and black lines on her face was my favorite, but frankly that might just be because she at least stood out design-wise. She didn't really have a character arc either, just rushed backstory that had no payoff. And then Kirk rides a motorcycle in a rocky canyon for some dumb reason.\n\nSigh.

Franklin headed by Idris Elba. The storyline finds Enterprise destroyed again, I mean how many times can the infamous ship by blown to pieces. At least with Star Wars the Falcon is repairable with Trekkies they have to restart from scratch much like this one. The only good thing that came out of this one was the tribute to the previous crew and a mention of Ambassador Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and Anton Yelchin who played Chekhov. The acting was subpar but the action sequences were fun to watch. The story was co-written by Scotty (Simon Pegg) which it was not bad but it just felt like a thirty minute television episode prolonged into a two hour no nonsense film. I believe Abrams loves Greg Grunberg, yet another movie he plays a cameo and what's up with that city in space which looks like a giant snow globe or an upgraded Deep Space Nine.

But apart from giving himself a comically pivotal role, Pegg's attempt to shoehorn old Trek into Abrams' established tone fails spectacularly. Lin's flat, dark directing manages to make the flourishes of nice dialogue and set design look as lifeless and ugly as the sound profile of this flick. No idea is really explored properly, the creative stamps of everyone on this film only serve to muddle. Bad plots, bad character choices, bad dialogue, bad directing, it's like cheap fan fiction. And it's immediately boring, the polar opposite of Trek XI. The Beastie Boys second coming in the franchise and the handling of Nimoy's passing are standout moments in a dull and disappointing film that should not have killed the franchise's chance of a possible kick ass fourth entry. There's life in this franchise Jim. Just give it to a director with some genuine spark to play in this sandbox. \nAlso the 3D sucks. Ghosting and lack of any meaningful depth, the film can be watched with the glasses off and it's even darker, is that's even possible. What a dull waste of time.",

Simon Pegg co-wrote the script and he really did just a great job at it, it is funny and smart and investing as a whole, he really knew what Star Trek was all about and why the fans loved this franchise, and we take this amazing script and have Justin Lin direct it, and it is just movie magic, the script and directing are the best things about this movie, it is done so well. I love Simon Pegg and think that he is one of the funniest and likable actors working today, I love the Mission Impossible series as well and we get double Simon with that franchise and this, he was able to do both backs to back and he never feels rushed, he never feels fatigued or bored, he really worked on these two iconic franchises together with incredible poise and professionalism, Pegg deserves way more credit than he is getting right now, he is a very loyal and committed actor and he should be recognized for it. This movie breaks up the whole crew into pairs of two and it breaks them down and humanizes these character, we also get added depth and chemistry to everyone, I loved Bones and Spock being together for a while, they were complete opposites, but both put aside their differences and became actual friends, I also liked the increased role of Anton Yelchin (RIP), and thought that he gave his best performance in this movie. Chris Pine kind of felt laid back and unconcerned with everything that happened, he definitely took a step back and helped make this movie a real team effort, which is good, but Pine wasn't quite as good as he has been previously. Idris Elba was very good in this movie, he was assertive and physically imposing, his character Krall was completely original and unseen before so it made him feel unique and mysterious, I do think that they spaced out when they learned of his back story too far apart because I found myself forgetting everything about him by the time that we learn more. This movie is sometimes very slow and cuts down on the action a lot, but we get smart and relevant conversations between these characters instead that just help to build them up. I personally found that the base camp portion of this film with Sulu and Uhura to be very boring and uneventful, It makes me kind of hesitant on rewatches because this portion of the film has nothing significant happen. This movie also feels way different than the first two films, the tone is less serious and dark, and it is more curious and heartwarming with all of the great character development, and it feels smaller scale than the other film as well, this had a new direction, it felt unique and fresh. All in all, this is a very fun and laid back sci-fi summer blockbuster with an amazing script and some great directing and character development, but the plot just wasn't as investing or eventful as I hoped that it would be. Still worth your time and is a valued edition into the Star Trek rebooted franchise.",

Having (spoiler alert) a song by The Beastie Boys playing to distract and confuse the aliens just breaks the forth wall, why not  use Klingon Opera or some real classical symphony (like Stravinsky's Rite of Spring) that has stood the test of time rather than a rap song. The plot was completely lame and unrealistic. The only good thing about this movie were the costumes of the aliens, they were very well done, but unfortunately, they looked more like they belonged in the Star Wars prequels than the Star Trek franchise, but good makeup nonetheless.",

Now that is not to say that the movie isn't good, quite the contrary. I think it's still better than about half of the entire Star Trek franchise, just not as good as the reboots. The visual effects definitely got a downgrade, the overall budget as well probably. Yorktown was an amazing visual feat, but it wasn't really a necessary thing to have in the movie, and I have the feeling that most of the visual effects budget went to that project. The swarm which Krall controls is definitely an interesting foe, as is Krall himself. He is played excellently by Idris Elba, but the make-up definitely downplays his performance. The score by Michael Giacchino is, yet again, amazing, but the some of the themes aren't as pronounced as they were before. Overall, Star Trek Beyond is a fun ride and an overall cohesive movie.",

While I admit nothing happened to Chekov to suggest he won't be in a fourth film in the reboot series, at least they didn't dare kill him off. J.J. Abrams even said that they don't plan on recasting him. And I'm always enthralled by the idea that Justin Lin directed this movie since he directed Fast & Furious 3, 4, 5 & 6, four entries from a franchise me and my friends like. Michael Giacchino's score is pretty good here too and I liked that Sledgehammer song Rihanna sung. Whilst J.J. Abrams' Star Trek 3 isn't inherently flawless, the visuals, action, performances and score compensate. And the Beastie Boys action sequence is pretty damn good as well.

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it s time once again to boldly go where moviegoers have been many times.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Yes, it s time for Star Trek Beyond - or as I like to call it - Beyond Belief. Let s recap.\n\nSCOTT: The Enterprise is docking at the space station Yorktown for some much needed R&R and resupplying. We discover that Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) has applied to become a Vice-Admiral, and that Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) is looking to leave Starfleet to follow the career path of the late great Ambassador Spock. Yorktown retrieves a vessel in distress and learns from her captain (Lydia Wilson) that her crew is stranded on a planet in a nearby nebula.\n\nGREG: The Enterprise takes off into the nebula only to be devastated by a swarm of thousands of two-man ships. The ships embed themselves into the hull of the Enterprise and the aliens jump out and kill the crew. The leader, Krall (Idris Elba), is in search of an artifact Kirk has secured on-ship. The damage to the Enterprise is so great that Kirk orders evacuation and separates the saucer section from the rest of the ship. Kirk and a handful of officers crash-land on Krall s planet and begin a plan to find him and determine the reason for the attack.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, your complaint about the last Trek movie was that it lacked originality, having been based on a story from the old movie franchise. You and I both asked for some fresh material in the next installment. Well, the Star Trek gods listened to us and delivered the goods in a big way. Star Trek Beyond offers up a fresh story loaded with new adventures, dilemmas, and villains. The result is a summer movie sizzler that runs on all eight cylinders and shines in every respect. One impressive feature of the movie is that, despite it being part of a long-running  series , our two main heroes (Kirk and Spock) undergo significant transformations. Kirk reverses his decision to pursue a promotion, recognizing he needs to be where the action is. Spock reverses his decision to pursue Ambassador Spock s career, and he also comes to realize that Uhura is his true love. They come about these transformations in interesting ways, too (more on that later). The strength of the two hero s journeys is one of many appealing elements of this film.\n\nGREG: Scott, I m truly happy that you enjoyed yourself at this film. I could not, however. This film was rife with plot holes and scientific inaccuracies. After witnessing what is possible with such films as Gravity, Interstellar, and The Martian it is hard to look at the most traditional of science fiction franchises and not expect that level of quality. This Star Trek is not the Star Trek I grew up with. It lacked a philosophical center that even the worst of the original series episodes managed to embrace. This was basically The Fast and the Furious in outer space. I was not amused. Let s take one of the climactic scenes in the film. Kirk and Spock need to find a weakness in the enemy. The vast swarm of ships under Krall s control communicate in some way that allows them act as a unit. Long story short - they use VHF radio communication. This is just preposterous. Even today, we humans have abandoned VHF in favor of digital communication. To add insult to injury, the frequency that disrupts these ships is precisely the frequency of The Beastie Boys song  Sabotage.  So Kirk, et al, destroy vast quantities of the enemy by simply flying through the swarm broadcasting  classical music.  As I said, this was Beyond Belief. And that is not the most egregious assault on my willing suspension of disbelief. Virtually every minute of Star Trek Beyond contained just such idiocy. This was a literal face-palm moment for me.\n\nSCOTT: There were plenty of meat and potatoes for me to feast on, Greg. For one thing we are treated to the trek universe s web of warm, complex characters who, with humor and creativity, work together to solve life-and-death problems. So much of the appeal of the original series centered on interpersonal relationships, character dynamics, and (as you point out) philosophical weightiness. In all the Star Trek feature-length movies, this latter asset (philosophy) has to be given short-shrift or else critics will swarm and ticket-purchasers will stay away. So yes, by design this movie isn t intended to make us ponder life s greatest issues. Yet Star Trek Beyond does manage to give us a villain who gives us something to think about. Edison is a disenchanted formed Captain whose xenophobia and paranoia transform him from good to evil. We see real world analogs in the current worldwide political scene. I love the way that the villain Krall was not a  pure evil  villain as I first feared; he turns out to be something far more sinister, a complicated man from inside Starfleet who was thought to have died a century ago. In terms of mentoring, we have a nice irony -- the person in the story who helps Kirk the most is our villain Edison himself, who during a fight with Kirk, accuses our hero of not really knowing who he is. This is a moment of clarity for Kirk. Edison s words crystalize Kirk s self-identity and pave the way for transformation. Another mentor for Kirk is his own father, who died when he was Kirk s age exactly. I d say this is more implicit mentoring from afar, the kind of mentoring that is always ongoing.\n\nGREG: As much as I truly respect and admire you Scott, I fear you ve fallen for a screenwriting trick. It s called  bookending.  The only bit of character development for Kirk happens in the beginning and ending of the movie. We open with Kirk saying that he wants out of space exploration. (We never witness this. He is telling us, not showing us). And then in the ending he has an epiphany evoked by a single sentence by the villain. However, we don t get to see that transformation. Kirk says it to the admiral in another talking-head scene. Hence bookends. We never see Kirk wrestle with these demons. We never witness his transformation. It s all bookended by (literally) one sentence at the beginning and one sentence at the end. It is the weakest of character transformations that can occur in a motion picture. And I can t agree with you on your premise that  philosophical weightiness  must give way to action on the big screen. In all three of the movies I mentioned above we are given philosophical problems to contemplate. I demand more from Gene Roddenberry s vision of the galactic future. As should we all. But the fact is that screenwriters Simon Pegg and Doug Jung and director Justin Lin (from the Fast & Furious franchise) opted to create massive visual effects rather than tell a character-based story. This is in direct response to the success of the Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Wars franchises. Simply put, this is Star Trek in name only. When comparing Star Trek to Star Wars, Roger Ebert said:  Ive seen space operas that put their emphasis on human personalities and relationships. Theyre called  Star Trek  movies.  We see very little of this interpersonal examination in Star Trek Beyond. And I don t know how you can call the villain Krall anything but one-dimensional and pure-evil. His entire backstory and his angst are revealed in a scene where someone reads his profile from a computer screen. It s just the most trivial character development in the history of film.\n\nSCOTT: Star Trek Beyond delivers the goods in a big way. All our favorite Trek characters are back and give us exactly what we want to see in any good Trek movie   terrific banter, good humor, fun action sequences, a fresh new story, an unexpected villain, help from surprising sources, and good solid character development. The CGI effects, director work, and cinematography are all off-the-scale outstanding here. Everything is running on all cylinders. I can t give 5 Reels because a movie like this is summer popcorn fare, but it s the filet mignon of popcorn, trust me. So 4 Reels out of 5 will have to suffice. Our two heroes, Kirk and Spock, are once again terrific buddy heroes, although it s probably more accurate to view this movie as an ensemble effort. In our latest book, Reel Heroes & Villains, we would probably call this group a police/military ensemble, to be precise. Anyway, our two heroes have all the characteristics of the Great Eight traits of heroes   smart, strong, reliable, resilient, charismatic, caring, selfless, and inspiring. Plus they transform themselves in meaningful ways, as I ve mentioned earlier. I ll give our heroes a rating of 4 out of 5 Heroes. The mentoring here is subtle, yet significant. Kirk must find his true identity and without a father or Captain Pike in the mix anymore, he s left to rely on memories of his father. He also fights a villain with a big mouth, a mouth that challenges Kirk to find his true self. This is exactly the kick in the pants that Kirk needs, and so he later decides to remain Captain of the Enterprise. Spock s mentor is Ambassador Spock, who may have the same distant, indirect mentoring effect as Kirk s dad. Overall, it s clear that mentoring was not a central feature of this movie and so the best I can do is award 3 mentoring points out of 5.  Movie:  Mentor:  Hero: \n\nGREG: I didnt find the characters in this installment of the Star Trek reboot particularly engaging. They were shadows of the characters I grew up with. Sure Simon Pegg put some iconic phrases in these actors  mouths. So they sounded familiar. But these were just phantoms pantomiming echoes of long-lost heroes. There weren t any real revelations for these characters. I can only muster 2 out of 5 Heroes. I saw scant mentoring in this film. As you point out we didn t have Captain Pike to guide our young Captain Kirk. The only mentors for Kirk and Spock were the lessons they learned from dead heroes. But we don t see them draw upon these lessons and exercise them to some effect in this film. I can only offer 1 Mentor out of 5. Scott, in the past you ve advised our readers to  just turn off your mind  when enjoying summertime popcorn fare. I m supposing you re doing the same thing here. However, I think the legacy of Star Trek is that of a thinking man s action adventure. We have plenty of movie franchises that offer quality entertainment without taxing our brains. Marvel does this exceedingly well. And DC Comics is hot on their heels. Star Wars has less complex character development in favor of action adventure. It s also a beloved franchise that we ve seen revived recently and held pretty much to its roots. This incarnation of Star Trek gives us something we already have in abundance: action adventure without a philosophical core. I ll give this film 2 out of 5 Reels because it s good entertainment. It has good performances and decent CGI. But it falls down on basic storytelling and scientific accuracy. In most of my reviews I relish the opportunity to lambaste a movie that falls down on the job. It is a chance to unleash the petulant smart ass in me. But this time I feel we ve lost something of great value. In a universe full of brain-dead science fiction action adventure, Star Trek was a beacon of science fiction that is fun, funny, heart-warming, and smart. Something I treasured is gone. Star Trek Beyond was a final opportunity to return to the Star Trek Gene Roddenberry imagined. I m in mourning because we ve lost something valuable that we can t get back. Star Trek is dead.

The film's set up seems right out of an old TV episode, which is very cool. The Enterprise is sent on a rescue mission, which ends up being an ambush and leaves them stranded and separated on an alien planet. This gives Spock and Bones lots of opportunities to verbally spar, Kirk and Chekov get to work together to survive, and best of all Scotty teams up with a plucky alien lady played by Sofia Boutella. Their nemesis is a very menacing Idris Elba as Krall. This entry is filled with loads of action for the summer blockbuster crowd, but is also smart enough to please the comic-con crowd.

Besides a lackluster story/flow to the movie, here is my biggest gripes (said out loud while watching):  1. The Enterprise gets totally ripped apart, and somehow manages to crash on a planet in tact (for the most part). 2. Somehow Kirk and others manage to get on board, fight the aliens (no spoilers) - turn on thrusters, jump on top, slide down the top side as the saucer section is tipping over, and run out of the way so it doesn't land on them.  Watch the scene again - this was ridiculous.  3. Kirk on the motorbike with mirror \"holograms\" - nobody could figure out that the one bike that was dumping sticky gooey shielded stuff from the back of it was the only \"real\" bike?  Come on.  4. SO the Federation built this huge super advanced space station, but it was equipped with zero transporters.  I say this because when the alien with the weapon goes into the life support system, they could have a) beamed him direct to the brig, or b) beamed a team of people to the life support area to kill him, or c) beamed him and the weapon straight into space, and zap with phasers.  A space Station of this size would surely be using site to site transport, with experts manning them.  If I watched again I could probably list more, but that is never going to happen.  Story line was good but needed more rich development and less stupid action.   Another \"could have been good\" movie.",

They always end up getting themselves in a whole heap of trouble, but it's all cool because it's a Star Trek film, and everything always works out fine in the end. Spoiler alert: this entry into the franchise is no different. The film sticks to the formula to a fault, complete with the fun action, good humor, and nonsensical plot. So yeah, there is nothing really original or noteworthy about it... but oh man, does it have some exciting sequences, one of which was probably the most exciting I have ever seen in a Star Trek film. The problem with this film lies with the plot, which is difficult to follow to say the least. I understood all the 'whats'... it's the 'whys' and the 'hows' that get murky. Idris Elba plays a great villain (as always), but hell if I know what exactly he was trying to accomplish with his villainy. Suffice it to say that there is a lot of nonsense thrown around here, but just don't think about it too much and enjoy the ride. Director Justin Lin has taken the reigns from JJ Abrams, and with mostly successful results - the movie is visually fantastic, it moves along nicely (the two hours runtime feels like much less), it's exciting without being overloading, and it allows each of the main characters time in the sun. There isn't a lot of character development here, but that's the benefit of making the third film in a franchise - we already know these people. Some new characters are even introduced, with varying levels of success. Being Star Trek, the dialogue can be pretty hokey, but I forgive it for that... it wouldn't be Star Trek without the cheese. Overall, I enjoyed this one more than 'Into Darkness', but not nearly as much as the first (the 2009 film). It's a great popcorn flick and certainly worth the rental.",

Firstly, I get in and the first thing I notice is senior citizens.  Not just an \n\nold couple here or an old couple there but single senior citizens... single senior citizens spread out all \n\nthroughout the theater.  I saw that and my face went straight to a frown.  I shrug that off though and \n\nget to my usual seat and all seems well... then they start laughing.  Not the senior citizens but the half \n\nbrained twits laughing in unison at one of the previews.  Then, just as the movie is starting, \n\nsomeone's phone makes a noise and little miss hot stuff in the back feels the need to speak for the \n\nentire theater and tell the person to turn their phone off at which point I hear someone mumble \n\nsomething back about working.  So the movie starts and the idiots laughing idiotically throughout the \n\nmovie continues, and it wasn't normal laughter because they were the only one's laughing.  Then, \n\nsome hag decides she needs a bathroom break half way through and on the way back thinks the seat \n\nnext to me that is half way up is where her seat at the top was until her friend at her seat calls her. \n\nAll in all, I do believe I may have hated the people in that theater more than any other theater I have \n\nbeen in.  Yet, they still didn't spoil the movie for me but the a/c they decided not to turn on until 15\n\nminutes in may have if it had stayed off.\n\n\n     The first 20 minutes were as expected - awkward.  I knew it'd be awkward due to Anton Yelchin's \n\ndeath prior to this films release and because of the makers deciding to make Sulu gay and introduce \n\nus to his husband and their adopted daughter for unnecessary reasons.  Once the awkwardness got \n\nout of the way things really started to pick up, and it did get interesting once the Enterprise came \n\nunder attack.  Where this movie succeeds most is where movies like ‘Batman V Superman' and \n\n‘Independence Day: Resurgence' failed.  ‘Star Trek: Beyond' managed to maintain action \n\nthroughout without being clumsy and tripping all over itself.  It was a bit heavy but kept under \n\ncontrol with strong performances from the cast amidst some impressive c.g.i.  Despite the \n\nunnecessary and boastful changes to Sulu, all in all it was what seemed like a solid close to the first \n\ntrilogy and a movie I will turn on at home when it becomes available.  However, if they add anymore\n\ngayness to Star Trek I am going to have to drop it.\n\n7 of 10      ",

In many ways, Justin Lin's direction is less assured than Abrams', namely in recapturing the same emotional heights of Star Trek and Into Darkness, but in other ways, Lin has crafted what feels much more like Star Trek of old than Abrams' two outings. The crew of the USS Enterprise use their skills in their particular fields to their full potential, giving everyone something to do (it's especially nice to see Chekov have a meaty role following Anton Yelchin's unfortunate passing) and crating the kinds of relationships that made the original series work so well. Lin does a great job of throwing in tasteful nods to the past entries of the franchise that are much less blatant than in Into Darkness, for example (one plot point involving the in-film passing of Spock Prime is especially touching), while also introducing new characters and worlds to the series. As far as new characters go, Sofia Boutella's Jaylah is a highlight, with a sense of resourcefulness and strength that could help make her a future staple in the Enterprise crew in potential sequels. Unfortunately, in line with the two preceding films, Beyond struggles with its villain, Krall. The character has a relatively clever twist revealed in the third act, but his motivations are that of the typical MacGuffin-hunting scoundrel, and the talent of Idris Elba is completely wasted. This is relatively minor in the grand scope of the film though, because just like the other two films, it's simply too much of a good time to be brought down by something like this. It never boldly goes beyond where the series has gone before, but to deny the utter fun of Star Trek Beyond would be a shame.",

This movie is the definition of \"dumb hollywood summer blockbuster\"\n\nFrom the basic plotholes, to the bad cgi, to the emotionally flat storylines...I would rank this around the same level as Transformer 2.\n\nThe movie starts with Kirk already being tired of being a Captain after only 3 years.  It then proceeds to a large set piece (a huge federation space station).  A random alien shows up saying her ship crashed in a nebula and asks for assistance.  Kirk of course is the only one who can answer the call for the mission (so far so good right?  nothing too horrible).  This is where it starts to go off the rails.\n\n\nFirst, the nebula is realized as....an asteroid field (which is not anything like what a nebula is).  After about 5 minutes they pierce it and realize there is a planet in the center, they scan it and it has no life.\n\nThen they get attacked by a swarm of ships, that tear the Enterprise apart and everyone crash lands on the planet.  The big bad guy (Krall) captures most of the crew, oh and he's a vampire that sucks out their life force to stay alive.\n\nEveryone appears to crash within about a 10 mile radius of each other (you know...after bailing out of orbit over a planet.....) and the debris of the enterprise. They meet an alien girl who found a federation ship that was crashed there a century ago.  Then it turns out Krall was actually the captain of that ship and hates the federation now (he became a vampire because of \"magical alien technology on the planet\").  He crashed there a century ago and wasn't able to fix his ship and leave (of course our heroes are able to fix it in under a day). To free the crew Kirk gets a motorcycle (that happens to be on the old federation ship...for some reason) and rides it in circles to distract Krall (very *very* bad cgi for the motorcycle riding...the wonderful 1990s style \"floating over the terrain\" effect).  The other heroes then of course beam the captured crew to safety.\n\nKrall decides now is the time to leave and attack that super space station from earlier with his drone ship army.  They commence the attack, and then Kirk and co take off with their ship (somehow making it fall gave it lift to fly....a ship that generates no lift....) and then blow up Krall's drone ship army by playing \"Sabotage by the Beastie Boys\" over some random radio frequency (...yes...they pick \"a frequency krall wouldn't suspect\"..........that's not how radios work).  This disrupts the swarm and they all blow up. Krall enters the space station and tries to release his bioweapon (after he drinks(?) some human blood he looks human again so he can blend in) and kirk fights him, and kicks him out an air lock.\n\n\nThis movie has zero stakes, zero motivation, zero emotion.  It is worse than Into Darkness by far and is among the worst movies I have ever seen.",

With their experience, they should know that if an approaching ship is \"jamming\" you, it's time for shields up. No delay, no messing around. Secondly, when your hull starts getting breached, it's time for tactical repositioning, aka running away. Their reaction times are just too slow in this film but then again, I guess it wouldn't make for much such an exciting story if they defended themselves better.

            "content": "50 years ago NBC premiered a new science fiction series that its creator, Gene Roddenberry, envisioned as \"Wagon Train in space.\" This hour-long action adventure series was titled, 'Star Trek.' It struck up for renewal in the first season, but even fan support cannot overcome the decision by the studio executives canceled a series of three years. In the 50 years since Star Trek has become the most successful science-fiction franchise ever encompassing six live-action television series, 13 future movies as well as an animated television series, numerous books and graphic novels as well as being one of the most prevalent topics of discussion and cosplay science fiction and fantasy conventions around the world. The on the 50th anniversary of this fantastic television series was, 'Star Trek Beyond, which is the third film in the reboot of the original series by science-fiction visionary JJ Abrams. Due to his involvement with revitalizing another juggernaut franchise, 'Star Trek,' Mr. Abrams stepped down from the roles of screenwriter and director remains detached as a producer. Taking over as director was Justin Lin, who has numerous credits in television and has helmed several movies of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise. The screenwriters for this outing of the Starship Enterprise were Justin Lin and Simon Pegg. Mr. Lin has several writing and directorial credits on television. Mr. Pegg not only reinvented the iconic role Engineer Montgomery Scott is a highly respected comedic writer and performer known on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. What these creative people did in the crafting of this film is not the top or fifth-century enthralling fans the capstone masterpiece, but rather provide a solid piece of entertainment that contains everything that made this series such a major contributor to the zeitgeist of several generations. Many fans, particularly of such wildly popular franchises of this, appear to be under the impression that each movie is obligated to be vastly superior everything that has come before. Not only is this unrealistic but it provided impossible expectations that will lead to disappointment. While this is not the best Star Trek film, ever it is incredibly enjoyable providing everything you expect from Star Trek.\n\nAs the film marking the 50th anniversary of the Star Trek franchise, there was more than the usual number of little Easter eggs sprinkled throughout this movie. The references run the gamut from blatantly obvious to those only true trekkers will be able to discern. For example in recognition of the cancellation of the original series after three years the opening scene shows Capt. James Kirk (Chris Pine) recording his personal log. He noted here they are three years into the five-year mission, and he is feeling restless because of how episodic stay has become. Later when Dr. Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban) offers a toast Kirk on his birthday, he states; \"perfect eyesight and a full head of hair.\" Fans will recognize this sentiment is a nod to a similar scene in Star Trek IV McCoy gives Kirk a pair of reading glasses as a birthday present in the well-known fact that William Shatner wears a toupee. The inside jokes such as this occurred throughout the entire film but as a testimony to the craftsmanship created minds behind the still the majority is given during the quieter times in the story so as not to impede the pacing of the action sequences. You might also notice that the film progresses that this seems to be more alien races than you have ever seen in Star Trek. In recognition of 50 years of entertaining fans with a reported 50 new species of aliens introduced. The introduction of a myriad of new life forms is more than a gimmick. It shows just how widespread the scope of the Federation of planets has become how many species have benefited from the benevolent empirics of the Federation.in many this film is sitting on it to Mr. Roddenberry and his visionary belief that humanity would one day be part of an intergalactic community dedicated to peace and exploration. This theme is brought out explicitly as a significant contributor to the central premise of the story.\n\nOne continuing trope in this new reboot is that the crew of the enterprise is always on the precipice of being disbanded, reassigned to other parts of Starfleet. Kirk is about to be made the youngest Vice Admiral in the fleet while Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) has just discovered that is often itself, Ambassador Spock (Leonard Nimoy), has just died and Mr. Spock feels he must leave Starfleet to dedicate himself to the reestablishment of the Vulcan race. The movie was made explicitly for 3-D. It is not only quite obvious that this is the intention from the start that the filmmaker, as well as a demonstration of his fundamental understanding of how to use the illusion of that, is an integral part of telling a story. All too often 3-D is still used as a gimmick which is all too often distracting rather than beneficial to the story. I was interested right in the beginning images of the Starship Enterprise artistically designed to show the grandeur of the best, the immense scope and attention to detail is breathtaking as the high-definition 3-D images make this iconic ship more realistic than you could ever have imagined. After an unsuccessful diplomatic mission where Capt. Kirk fails to bring peace to two warring factions he brings his ship back to the nearest base. One of the most incredible visuals provided is with the Federation's newest Starbase, Starbase Yorktown. It is an incredible transparent sphere internally crisscrossed by a plethora of habitable plank ways. It is so large that it is transparent to within it easily holds a ship as large as the Enterprise allowing the inhabitants of the Starbase to watch the ship move to its docking port casually. This cosmopolitan location offers a natural site depicting many of the new alien species of aliens and humans going about their business in peace and security. After the Enterprise docks, the scene of the crew and their families reunited is shown. One reunion, in particular, included Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu (John Cho), helmsman and third officer of the ship. Use joyfully greeted by his husband and their daughter.\n\nEmergency escape pod brings an alien, Klara (Lydia Wilson), to the base. She informs the Starfleet officers that she was the only one to escape the crash landing as her crew became stranded in a nearby nebula. Starfleet immediately dispatches the most technologically advanced ship they have, the Enterprise on a rescue mission. This film manages to show the resulting set of circumstances with greater scientific accuracy than usually shown in most space operas. Often, to enhance the dramatic effect by having a ship life through an asteroid belts a great deal of skills necessary to avoid crashing. Meteors in such an environment are typically hundreds of miles apart posing no threat to navigation. It was possible to obtain the same emotional intensity with greater accuracy by using a nebula. As the birthplace of the star and its solar system, it would contain rocky rubble destined to become planets. The 3-D rendering of such objects ranging from tiny rocks to sizable boulders is the throw to watch. Adding to the immersive nature of the experience with Dolby ATMOS audio fills the room perfectly coordinated sounds reflecting the position of what's on screen.\n\nThe big man found in this story is right in line with what the original series portray. Krall (Idris Elba) is an alien warlord is a planet where Kara's ship and crew were held. Before the Enterprise and get in range of the planet, The Enterprise becomes under attack by a cloud of tiny spaceships. There are thousands of these the ships acting as swarm systematically attacking the Enterprise the shares down in the reference are useless against such a multitude of small targets. In a very short time, the attackers cut the Enterprise into pieces. First, the warp nacelles are ripped away followed by removal of the source of the section from the main hall. Thankfully emergency protocols such that many of the crew use escape parts of the majority sought safety in the sources section. When that section lands on the planet, they are immediately taken hostage by Krall. While not the first time fans have seen the Enterprise destroyed, but it is by far the most dramatic. Once again 3-D in high definition bring realism to the individual ships of the swarm and their corresponding presence in the audio track pulls you into the space battle like nothing ever before. Imagery such as this demonstrates how the technology should be used to enhance the feeling of reality making the audience a natural part of the story.\n\nIt wouldn't be a Star Trek film without a beautiful alien female in this requisite role is filled by Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), a beautiful and highly resourceful survivor of another ship captured by Krall. She immediately bonds with Mr. Scott (Simon Pegg) over a mutual love of engineering and fixing things. She takes into her home which happens to be a Federation starship lost for over a century, the Farragut. You might recognize the actress from another high-octane adventure movie, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' where she played a deadly assassin with the legs replaced by spring prosthetics. Having the female lead bond with a character other than Captain Kirk is a novel twist for any Star Trek film. I n this reboot of the original series unusual romances are just part of the charm. Mr. Spock is an ongoing relationship with the communications officer, Lieutenant Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana). There is even a cleverly written scene that subtly plants a plot device necessary for the story's resolution. On a sad note, this is the final film for Anton Yelchin, who played Ensign Pavel Chekov, the ship's primary navigator. This actor tragically died in an automobile accident at the age of 27 months after completing the principal filming. The film is available in several formats including Blu-ray 3-D and 4K UHD.",

I was surprised at how little of this film took place in space, though that is the sort of departure that can bring new energy to a formulaic franchise.  Honestly, I enjoyed the first two but had no desire to see this one.  My \"If you've seen one, you've seen them all\" attitude has developed from the oversaturation of superhero films over the past 10 years and has made skeptical toward the latest flavor of the week.  This film manages to feel different than the others and nicely developed the main characters.  It is very deserving of its Oscar nomination for Best Hairstyling and Makeup, especially on Jaylah and Kalara.  I can only imagine what it was like to walk around on set and see these aliens roaming about.  The special effects are incredibly realistic and the design of the Yorktown space station was very interesting.  The story itself is a bit of a step down from the previous films in that the villains aren't as scary as Klingons and the death of Leonard Nimoy resulted in the end of the creative parallel timeline that incorporated the elder Spock into the story.  The best part of the film may be the subtle tribute to Nimoy and the rest of the first generation Star Trek crew.  \"Star Trek Beyond\" is not my favorite film from the reboot series but its non-formulaic story has inspired me to give the next installment a chance.",

Never know when you'll need one of those! I struggled through it just to see if my predisposition was accurate. It was worse than I thought. They've just taken the idea of a space science fiction movie and slapped the Star Trek banner on it and named the characters after those in the earlier series. \n\nSo leave your common sense in the lobby. After all, you too can be a starship captain after a couple of years in the academy, and get handed the premier starship in the fleet. Typical Millennial thinking. My daddy was a great starship captain; I don't follow rules because I know better than all the experts who have been here forever; I deserve a seat at the table; Give me your best starship and make me senior to arguably the best Star Fleet Officer around-who also trained me-and after 3 years of being a captain I'd like to be an admiral...sigh.\n\nA waste of good actors.

First,Star Trek beyond is an action movie that departed from what makes Star Trek unique: an exploration of ideas, science, new worlds, and the unknown.  Action and exploration don't have to be mutually exclusive; but, here we simply get lots of commotion, crashing, fights, in a movie that appears catered to the lowest common denominator. Typically, Star Trek audiences are thoughtful, intelligent, and principled.  This movie is none of this.  Next, the plot is moronic boiler-plate material.  The flick throws in some cool sci-fi elements, but digging any deeper, all you have here is a 2-dimensional villain story that steals its entire plot from the first Star Trek reboot.  What a disappointment!  Another villain motivated by misplaced revenge surrounding the destruction of the Romulan homeworld!?  Come on!  Be more creative than that, PLEASE!  They just re-hash old stuff here, with a bad guy as deep as a small petry dish.!  Finally, the new character they bring into the fold distracts attention away from the old core cast of heroes, who are almost secondary characters to this poorly-developed action heroine. Somebody get some real writers on this script!!! Yeesh. \n\nYes, a life-long Star Trek fan thinks this movie stunk like",

Struggling to find continued meaning in the endless nature of their mission of exploration, Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) has applied for a promotion to Vice Admiral and commanding officer of Yorktown. He recommends Spock (Zachary Quinto) as the new captain of the Enterprise. Meanwhile, Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) reunites with his family, Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg) works to keep the ship operational, and Spock and Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana) amicably end their relationship; Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock has died. The Enterprise is dispatched on a rescue mission at short notice after an escape pod drifts out of a nearby uncharted nebula. The survivor, Kalara, claims her ship is stranded on Altamid, a planet within the nebula. The rescue turns into an ambush by Krall (Idris Elba), a powerful mutated alien warlord, when the Enterprise is severely damaged by a massive swarm of small ships, with its deflector dish destroyed and warp nacelles severed. Krall and his crew board the crippled ship and unsuccessfully search for a relic called the Abronath that Kirk had obtained from a failed diplomatic mission. Krall captures and removes many crew members from the ship and has his swarm ships cut the Enterprise in half at the neck section. Kirk then orders the crew to abandon ship as the Enterprise's saucer section hurtles towards the planet and crashes on the surface. Kirk and his crew needs to stop Krall from starting a galactic war...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Star Trek Beyond continues the franchise's post-reboot hot streak with an epic sci-fi adventure that honors the series' sci-fi roots without skimping on the blockbuster action. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and said, \"Even with its big-screen pyrotechnics and its feature-length running time, Star Trek Beyond plays like an extended version of one of the better episodes from the original series, and I mean that in the best possible way.\" Scott Collura of IGN awarded the film 8.4/10, describing it as being: \"terrific, a fun and exciting entry in the series that balances subtle fan service while also feeling fresh and modern; Star Trek Beyond is the perfect way to celebrate the series' 50th anniversary.\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the screenplay by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung, \"injects a welcome strain of humor that's true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation, delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration\", and went on by saying: \"While Beyond won't unseat 1982's thrilling The Wrath of Khan as the gold standard for Star Trek movies, it's a highly entertaining entry guaranteed to give the franchise continuing life.\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety, in an otherwise positive review, described the film being: \"a very familiar, old-fangled, no-mystery structure, and that's because it's basically the Star Trek version of an interplanetary action film, with a plot that doesn't take you to many new frontiers.\" Furthermore, he called Star Trek Beyond: \"a somewhat diverting place holder, but one hopes that the next Star Trek movie will have what it takes to boldly go where no Star Trek movie has gone before.\" Mark Hugues of Forbes said, \"Star Trek Beyond is the third-best Star Trek film of all time, creating the sort of emotional connection and familiar, powerful characterizations we loved in the original series while delivering top-notch action and the best Star Trek movie villain since First Contact's Borg Queen.\" Despite its international success, Star Trek Beyond was met by critics who were less taken with the film. Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film 1 1/2 stars out of 4 and he commented that the filmmakers \"should have called it Star Trek Into Drowsiness.\" Smith later added, \"Beyond is tepid when it's trying to be emotional, moronic when it's trying to be thrilling and unfunny when it's trying to be non-unfunny. It lacks a storytelling module: Things just click into place when needed, as when Kirk commands Scotty to rev up a busted old spaceship, Scott says it's impossible, and 14 seconds later everything is ready to rip.\" James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave 2 1/2 stars out of 4, writing: \"Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one; The action sequences are frenetic, kinetic, and at times incoherent. This isn't unexpected; it's Lin's trademark. But the plot, credited to Simon Pegg & Doug Jung, is pure Trek. Unfortunately, it's also instantly forgettable.\" Dave Robinson of outlet Crash Landed writes that \"Star Trek Beyond fails to push beyond its own roots and becomes just another very safe sci-fi popcorn movie in an increasingly crowded market, that will likely have you leaving the theatre feeling exactly as you entered.\" Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+ and wrote, \"With Beyond, it feels like just another summer tentpole with not enough going on underneath the tent.\"\n\nWhen J.J. Abrams rebooted the Star Trek universe in 2009 it was with a great ensemble, solid sci-fi action, thrilling visuals and a script that fitted the franchaise in my mind. I thought \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" was even better and when the third one was in the making I was hoping it would be even a notch higher, despite the fact that they hired Fast & Furious Justin Lin as the director. But, to my disappointment \"Star Trek Beyond\" is the weakest film in the reboot if you ask me. The high speed action and instant thrills are obviously what Lin has focused on and he has totally forgotten about having a functional and intriguing plot (bad job by writers Simon Pegg and Doug Jung), which in this case lacks moral dilemmas, proper exploration of space and solid dynamics between the characters. There´s no further development of the characters and the CGI takes over most of the film. The villain Krall is not that villain like and the great Idris Elba does his best with what he is served. And the added alien scavenger sidekick Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) is not working at all in my book. And I can´t help feel that the late Anton Yelchin´s  (Rest in peace) character Chekov is just annoying and he almost becomes a bad caricature instead. While I think Karl Urban´s Doctor 'Bones' McCoy still holds up as a great character. \"Star Trek Beyond\" takes us back several steps in the reboot and I really hope they come up with a better script for the fourth one.",

            "content": "Star Trek Beyond really saves face for the series after the uninspired and shamelessly derivative \"Into Darkness\". It's a back to basics Trek, an original series episode as a feature length movie but with a few modern touches (no dont run away it's all good!) it's a very funny, breathlessly paced adventure film that wastes little time with exposition and just sets off on a sprint. The villain is once again somewhat underwritten and half baked in his nefarious plot (although Idris Elba dose really good work with what he's given) and the last act is a regrettably chaotic clusterfuck of stuff happening that gets a bit tiresome, plus the mostly great effects work in this film suddenly goes out the window in a big way and we get the typical hollywood blockbuster climax where the production was obviously getting close to crunch time and things had to be wrapped up leaving many of the cgi at the climax looking unfinished and textureless, and it all goes on for so long that it becomes hard to invest in it all. But overall this is more of what i want from the new series, a (sort of) return to old school trek. Some of the chrarcters are a bit sidelined (including, quite sadly, the late Anton Yelchin as Chekov, who isnt given a whole lot to do) but mostly the way the plot seperates the crew for most of the movie creates interesting little dynamics, especially satisfying is Bones and Spock's (Karl Urban and Zachery Qunto, as terrific as ever) buddy movie banter. Thres is also, notably, some truly brillinatly inventive camera work and very creative action set pieces that  feel refreshing amidst all the big budget sameness of most summer movies. Lets hope they continue the good work laid down by this flawed but great film. Roll on part four, or twelve.",

Unfortunately, this movie did not entice me as much as the other movies did, it didn't have the best plot, the action was pretty standard, and it just felt like a slightly recycled version of the first movie. Nothing about this movie was bad; however, nothing stood out, and as I watched I waited for things to start picking up, but it never did, and ended up just being mediocre throughout. The loss of Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie, and the transition to Idris Elba (Krall) was a downgrade, not because Elba wasn't good, but because Elba's character wasn't set up to be as deep and meaningful in the movie as Cumberbatch's. Although still an enjoyable movie, \"Star Trek Beyond\" in my eyes is the weakest out of the three reboot Star Trek movies, and needs a lot more of the excitement, energy, and engagement that the other two had, and as it stands, \"Star Trek Beyond\" is only worth watching if you're bored.",

            "content": "I have mixed emotions about STB.  It is, like so many other sci-fi and action-adventure movies nowadays, awash in stunning CGI locations (perhaps that is at the heart of my consternation - it is like so many other sci-fi and action-adventure movies).  The production quality and the acting really are top shelf, which is why I'm so frustrated, because it seems all that talent (on and behind the screen) are wasted by the writers.  The problem I had with this movie is that it lacks almost everything that should hold a movie - particularly a Star Trek movie - together.  \n\nFirst off - a good story (all things being equal) should set two characters that have opposing goals squarely in front of each other (so to speak) and let the conflict fly.  Krull and Kirk (and crews) are just on opposite sides of a yet to be declared war, and even after the movies explains why the bad guy, Krull, is so bent on punishing the Federation, I still really have no idea why.  It's like we've been dropped in on a playground and one kid punches the other and we don't know why, but we have to sit and watch the brawl that ensues.  And... since we've spent the entire movie not knowing, it feels like \"what does it matter at this point\" when Krull's motives are revealed.  I just leave his whole storyline thinking they had a grand stage with which to make a profound statement about the nature of terrorism (which is what it is) and they don't. Too bad.\n\nNext is the problem of series movies.  When the supporting characters (in this instance Jaylah) are more interesting than the main characters, you have a problem.  Before seeing the movie, I anticipated Jaylah was going to be the \"bad guy\" because of her prominence on ad material - I don't recall ever seeing Krull anywhere!  She's smart, tough, funny (what is fast becoming the trend of Hollywood - the woman action hero because we need to demonstrate gender equity) and the rest of the cast (Scotty being my only exception) seem to be groaning under the weight of their collective angst by comparison.  She's lost someone (a bunch of someones, which Scotty points out), but it doesn't crush her like all the storyline baggage seems to do for the rest of our cast.\n\nI really felt like this show was going to finally get beyond (see what I did there) the nostalgia for the original series, but perhaps Nemoy's passing was just too great a thing for the production crew to pass up.  Spock has cast such a long shadow on this rebook, the whole thing is becoming an ongoing homage to him and him alone.  Nemoy has been the through line of so many Star Trek iterations, and was a constant high light, so I feel bad saying this, but it's time to move on.\n\nSulu's gayness... I just think it was a completely fruitless insertion into the series.  If Takei doesn't like it, why do it?  It was too much for fans who knew what it was (a forced, if limp, foray into gay friendliness) and too little to add any serious heft to the story line (it's not like there was anything at all beyond a picture and a hug that gave us emotional connection to these add-ons, let alone explain how Sulu got connected with them or what they were doing in deep space.)  The whole thing was misguided and poorly executed.  Now all future movies are saddled with this bad choice (unless they explain it away as Sulu's brother or some such, which they could given the complete lack of anything).\n\nNext... I feel like once Patrick Stewart said \"plenty of more letters in the alphabet\" the ships have become throw-away props.  I hope future movies (of course they'll keep making them now) realize that the ships are as much a character in these stories (Millennium Falcon - Hello!) as the people.  That being said, at least the interiors of the Enterprise looks like a ship in this film and not a brewery or baggage handling facility.\n\nThe whole reboot has not known what to do with Bones.  In the first Abrams movies, he was witty and his sequence with getting Kirk sick to get him on board the Enterprise was great, but beyond that he's been like a dislocated appendage.  He spends more time as a pilot (a pilot! the man who didn't even want to go into space can be a pilot!?) than he does being a doctor.  Maybe we're into pet peeve area here, but have we ever even seen sick bay in the reboots?  Another problem with series movies - you almost have to write something for everyone and (as Uhura and Chekov can also testify about), you can't have something for everyone.  Too bad.\n\nLastly, a couple of irritating things that maybe I shouldn't think too much about in this kind of movie.  Where did all those \"bee\" ships come from?  Attacking the station, it's like there are billions of them, but there is nothing beyond a throwaway line in Krull's explanatory moments to give any indication where they came from - I guess it is another of the many, many plot elements that they \"explain\" with a single sentence, and you just shouldn't think about (that's my problem I guess, I thought about this movie instead of just gloried in the graphic glitter).  It just seems to me that if you have billions and ships and therefore pilots, it behooves you to do a little more leg work on explaining where they all came from.\n\nI did appreciate the homage to the Enterprise series that was done.  Though I wondered how the Franklin could have a higher registry number (326) than the NX-01 when it was to have been an older ship is certainly nerdy, but I liked how they connected that series here.  \n\nSo... high marks for the cast.  High marks for the CGI crew.  Low marks, in my opinion, for the producers.",

Plenty of action, good special effects and a not too bad story. However, one thing irked me to now end. They blew up the enterprise...again. Stop destroying the bloody Enterprise in every movie for Christ sake! Been there, seen that done that. It is getting both old and frustrating.\n\nApart from that it was a good entry in the new timeline movie series. I am not sure what all those people giving it one star ratings and calling it the worst movie ever expected to get? Anyone who has watched the two other movies should be expecting a fairly action loaded blockbuster with lots of CGI in it and that is exactly what we got. Personally I think this is a good thing. I was getting rather bored by some of the previous installments in the original timeline where they almost never fired a shot and tried to talk or reason their way out of every problem they encountered.\n\nThe story was not too bad although I have to agree that it did not really advance the story or timeline much. It was more like a TV-show episode blown up to a full feature movie. It worked nicely though as a action story although I would have liked to know more about how Edison transformed into Krall and, although that could be explained by some mutation caused by the alien technology, how he managed to transform himself back to Edison.\n\nThe CGI with the alien swarm moving fluidly over the screen and the huge Yorktown station was quite stunning as far as I am concerned. I also liked that the ships, both Enterprise and the Franklin could take quite a bit of abuse before starting to fail. In a lot of the previous movies as well as the TV-shows it took one hit and some console exploded and the warp core went down.\n\nAll in all both me and the kids quite liked this installment in the series.",

            "content": "Star Trek: Beyond review. It is a pretty cool season of movies at the moment. Pretty much something interesting to go and see every week if I can be bothered (and can muster the finances). So I skipped Tarzan and decided to jump in on Star Trek hoping for the best. It turns out that these current Star Trek movies are on a really decent roll. The first of this trilogy surprised all of us by actually being exciting and fresh, something Star Trek has always been a bit hit and miss with. The second movie floundered a little in trying to find it's purpose but I was one of the people who came away still feeling it was a good movie. A large part of that is how much I enjoy watching Benedict Cumberbatch acting. This third movie has the benefit of not having to set up characters and so can straight away launch into the type of movie it wants to be. And I really enjoyed the direction it took. See Star Wars is about a rag tag group of heroes fighting against all odds to save the galaxy. It is meant to be battles and action. Star Trek is based on a long running tv series where the crew of the USS Enterprise are explorers discovering something new every week. And this movie is the first of this new series that actually feels like that. The Enterprise feels like an exploration vessel that has been journeying for years. You can feel that so much of space has been explored and yet a vast majority of it is still yet to be discovered. Entire species exist out in the cosmos that the Federation don't know about. I really love that feeling. The stock standard characters are all acted really well and some new characters are introduced to add a bit of intrigue. Almost all of the scenes are visually impressive (except for that motorbike shot, just one annoying shot) and some people had a lot of fun designing some cool ideas, especially in the space station. Overall Star Trek feels right even if it doesn't make you jump out of your seat with excitement. This is not like going to watch a Star Wars movie for me even remotely. But is it a decent science fiction movie you can enjoy? Yes, definitely.",

            "content": "Way to go Star Trek, overcoming the third movie curse and being a pretty damn good installment.  I don't think it can be denied that this is probably the poorest of the reboot series, but considering how strong they've all been it's still impressive that it's anywhere near that massively high bar.  It really feels like 2 films ultimately, one that's a pretty good adventure, and one that's breathtakingly incredible.  The first half is mostly the crew stranded on a single planet, with various unlikely duos (Bones and Spock, Chekov and Kirk, etc.) trekking (no pun intended) through the wilderness trying to find everyone else and trying to figure out who this new baddie is who's targeting them.  This part of the film is pretty good.  It's fun seeing these unexpected pairing play off each other, and it feels a little closer to the original series of Star Trek in spirit.  It is however a little disappointing to be stuck on a single planet for most of the film, and since we don't find out the villains motivation until the final 20 minutes we spend most of the movie just seeing him as some asshole.  The final act, is incredible.  The climax in a city center with an interesting use of gravity (think Super Mario Galaxy rules) makes for a great final fight, and once the villains motivations are revealed it's suddenly a lot easier to give a shit about what's going on.  Even then though, while Idris Elba plays the villain great, his motivations are pretty cliché to this series.  Once again it's a villain who had something bad happen to him, and he blames Starfleet.  There's some unique twists to that formula that I appreciated, but it doesn't break the formula.\nSo overall it's a mixed bag.  An okay set up, a pretty good adventure exploration middle, and an astounding climax.  All of the Enterprise crew are still as charismatic as ever, and I liked the new focus on characters who don't always get as much attention, but the villain is fairly week despite some interesting ideas.  It didn't blow me away the way the first Star Trek film did, and it didn't up the ante to the level the second did, but it's still a solid entry in a very enjoyable series.",

J. Abrams and the change in directors does mercifully get rid of the lens flare that spoiled dramatic moments in previous entries. The problem is when it tries to be more like Abrams films; there is one amazing set piece, but the rest of the action tries too hard to be fun or dramatic and veers into silliness.

It certainly looked spectacular, which was expected, and the witty script wasn't bad but it really isn't character driven and it jumped in right at the deep end, way too fast. You do get to hear about Captain Kirk's (Chris Pine), thirst for excitement at the beginning of the movie and the director touched on the relationship between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) but apart from that, the characters haven't really moved on from the previous movies. With that aside, it's full of intense drama and the action scenes were quite impressive. Idris Elba (Krall), played the enemy quite well and his mannerisms and and strange make-up worked for his character but his purpose for causing so much destruction was slightly weak. Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), was one of the best introductions in the movie, and the whole look and feel of her character, worked well alongside Scotty (Simon Pegg) but the main character, Captain Kirk, seemed quite moody and he lost his sense of humour, which was what made the previous movies so great. It's still a watchable film, which pushes the enterprise crew to the limit but it's not the best in the new franchise. Watchable!\r\n\r\nRound-Up:\r\nIt's a shame that J.J. Abrams didn't return as the director in this franchise, because the original Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness, really did work and the mixture of wit and intense drama was put together well. He did produce this movie, so he hasn't left the franchise all together but with his busy schedule with the Star Wars franchise, it's totally understandable that he has handed over the baton. With Justin Lin stepping into directors chair, and Simon Pegg contributing his writing skills, they certainly done the whole Star Trek brand justice with this film, and with Anton Yelchin and Leonard Nimoy passing away before its release, it was good to see condolences for them, in the end credits. Justin Lin's previous work include Better Luck Tomorrow, Annapolis, Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast & Furious, Fast & Furious 5 & 6 and a couple of episodes of True Detective, and with over 10 projects in the pipeline, which include Space Jam 2, he doesn't shy away from the big projects with, huge budgets. Although the characters seemed a bit stuck in time, I still enjoyed the movie and it was good to see the original cast back together again.\r\n\r\nBudget: $185million\r\nWorldwide Gross: $343million\r\n\r\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies, starring Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Idris Elba, Sofia Boutella and Joe Taslim. 6/10",

The story itself was good too and everyone can notice the comedic mastery of Simon Pegg at hand, because the movie has quite a few very funny moments. Overall, it's was great entertainment and with all it's power and soul, it was a fitting send off and a last hurrah for the late actors Leonard Nemoy and Anton Yelchin.",

The first film in 2009 was one of the year's best pictures and Benedict Cumberbatch was a breath if fresh air in the not as good sequel Into Darkness. With Beyond we perhaps have the weakest entry in the new trilogy but that isn't to say it isn't still a decent film. It brings back all the old characters and teams them with the member of the crew they haven't quite spent a lot of screen time with. The film does this well and despite spending a lot of time apart, the crew still fizzle when they get their moments together. Idris Elba is the next actor in the line of villains and he plays Krall well beneath the heavy prosthetics. The only downside with this character is that his pan is rather bleak and contrived. Justin Lin directs well but it does miss the Abrams blueprint. Simon Pegg and Doug Jung bring a decent enough script to the table but some of the dialogue could have been sharpened or even delivered better. This isn't as dark as the previous entries but it is a solid addition. Let's just see if these actors continue on the Enterprise's adventures or if this trilogy is enough. As long as the filmmakers don't make a film weaker than this one then all should be ok. Enjoyable if not the greatest Enterprise outing.",

            "content": "The voyages of the starship [i]Enterprise[/i] in this rebooted, alternate time line continue. Three years into its five year mission the crew reach [i]Yorktown[/i] space station, a large fancy looking hub with a stupid name. James T. Kirk grows tired of life in space, Spock has split with Uhura, Sulu has reunited with his family and is apparently gay now, Spock Prime has died and Scotty just continues to fix stuff. Its a veritable soap opera in space and we're no closer to seeing any whales it seems.\n\nSo what should happen next? why a rescue mission of course (stupid question). A ship (the [i]USS Franklin[/i]) is supposedly crashed and stranded on a planet (Altamid) which is inside a nebula, according to a lone survivor in a drifting escape pod. So like the good little bunch of humanitarians they are the crew blast off into said nebula to assist. Not long after entering the nebula the crew find they are unable to stay in contact with Yorktown, communications down, hmmm smells like a tra...oh. Yep before you can quote a Rebel Admiral from another sci-fi fantasy flick the Enterprise comes under attack from a vast swam of small ships. These ships are able to completely destroy the Enterprise, but not before the crew can escape to the planet below and we meet the antagonist Krall (Idris Elba). Long story short, Krall is after a mcguffin which is part of a super weapon that can kill people very easily. Oh and he wants to wipe out Yorktown with it, bet you didn't see that coming huh.\n\nThis movie really started off badly in my opinion. The opening mini plot with Kirk off on a diplomatic mission to offer the mcguffin to this alien race was, for all intense and purposes, crap. The whole sequence looked crap, the CGI aliens were crap, Pine's acting against the CGI aliens was crap, it wasn't funny even though it was really trying to be, and in general it just looked like something from a mock Star Trek picture (like 'Galaxy Quest'). Then as we progress further, the initial trap and space battle that sees the Enterprise torn apart was also pretty ropy looking in my opinion. When I say ropy I mean it just looked like a messy cluster of CGI nonsense. Hundreds of tiny CGI spaceships zooming around in large CGI swarms like little flies or tiny birds, laser blasts everywhere, everything moving quicker than you can comprehend...ugh! Basically its hard to make out what's going on because so much was happening on the screen, and it all looked CGI.\n\nThe planet that the crew find themselves stuck on for a large portion of the movie just happens to be a lush, green, Endor-like world with a breathable atmosphere. Also, Kirk and co just happen to come across a sexy female alien with alluring body art, oh and she just happens to be an expert in martial arts, weapons and has converted the USS Franklin into her home. Said Starfleet ship also just happens to be the same ship that houses all the secrets to Krall and his followers, and it just so happens to have a motorbike on board too. Gee I'll bet my bottom Dollar that will come in handy at some point...probably for an action sequence of some kind? eh! oh yes. I did find myself wondering just what the hell would a motorbike be doing on a spaceship...I really should know better by now.\n\nYeah so the bad guy is after the mcguffin weapon thingy which he thinks Kirk has, but Kirk and co are just trying to get off the planet. Krall then finds the mcguffin, explains what its all about to Kirk and co, as you do, and carries on explaining how he's gonna wipe out Yorktown. So now Kirk and co are involved in trying to stop Krall with the help of Jaylah the sexy alien with alluring body art. This obviously leads to a battle between the Starfleet crew and Krall's endless supply of henchmen. Expect lots of laser blasts, leaping around, many moments of deus ex machina, fast quips, boring martial arts and of course...that motorbike. \n\nSo anyway eventually the crew manage to escape off Altamid by fixing the USS Franklin, they set off after Krall who's now gone off to destroy Yorktown. We do see a lot of Krall's henchmen on the planet admittedly, but not as many as is indicated by the amount of ships he has at his disposal. Like seriously there must be thousands upon thousands of these tiny ships that make up this swarm. Where the hell did all the pilots come from to fly these ships? Why didn't we see this army on the planet surface? Where did they park all those ships on the planet? How has no one come across this small army until this point?? Secondly, where did Krall get all these ships? How come they are able to penetrate and virtually fly through solid metal?? What on earth are these things made out of?? Its also at this point that the franchise kinda sinks for me. Why? because they use a contemporary rock song to accompany an action sequence in space. Yes its actually a part of the plot but still, for me that is not something you do in a Star Trek movie. I blame this on the director Justin Lin, yeah you can do that all you want in trash like [i]The Fast and Furious[/i] franchise, but not in Star Trek thank you.\n\nWell to answer some of those points, as we discover Krall is actually a former pre-Federation soldier and captain (Balthazar Edison) of the USS Franklin on this Endor-like planet. This guy became upset when the Federation was formed because humans essentially made peace with alien enemies and put him out of work. He and his crew were also unlucky enough to get stranded on said planet (through a rogue wormhole apparently) and believed the Federation had abandoned them. Although I'm still not too sure how they were not found up until this point considering the technology and time span we're talking here. This all happened back in the year 2164 I believe, the ship and crew only being discovered in the present Star Trek year of 2263. With this movie being set in the alternate timeline, this would be the alternate series of events for the USS Franklin. Although this ship is new to the franchise I believe so technically it had no original series of events, if you wanna be really picky.\n\nMoving on, Edison and his crew managed to stay alive all this time by utilising the extinct native alien technology that was left behind on the planet. How they worked out how to use this extinct alien technology is anyone's guess. How they even got it to work is another guess because surely an extinct alien races technology might be low on batteries. For some reason said technology gave the crew life but also turned them into powerful mutants? Oh and it also gave Balthazar the power to drain another living organisms life force? Oh and all those henchmen are actually alien drones that he managed to get going and utilise for his indestructible swarm (I guess the ships were the extinct alien races tech too). And why exactly did he change his name to Krall? Because it just sounded like a cool alien name or what? What's the deal with that?\n\nYes there are lots of amazing factors here, it always takes me time to get my head around these Trekkie plots (especially with the alternate timeline and new additions) but are you even surprised? The timeline in general for this franchise is so bloody convoluted its unreal. I feel like I need to do major research into Trek lore just to understand the basics in these plots because there's so much backstory. Yet despite that aspect, [i]Star Trek[/i] has well and truly become an action franchise these days and alas this third movie merely continues that trend. The plot wasn't the labyrinth of time travel the original 2009 reboot was admittedly, but once again it just feels like an extended TV episode. The villain is a bog standard bloke, doesn't really look very unique, usual goals, played poorly by Elba (alien race with cockney accent huh). The crew do their usual thing, the action scenes were bland, bog standard henchmen types, lots of stupid looking brightly coloured aliens, stupid body markings, crappy CGI swarms of spaceships etc...I just didn't feel it with this, the whole thing just felt tired, a paint-by-numbers job. The original 2009 reboot felt fresh and exciting (despite the horrendous time travelling/alternate timeline nonsense), but how quickly that has faded away. I'm starting to think the franchise is really running on empty now.",

I have seen many space adventure films, but I never felt this series so interesting. I enjoyed some of the 'Star Trek' films though. I know this sequel is not good the previous ones, but for me this look okay than those. Because it was so simple, particularly story wise, and the rest of the film was action and adventure.\n\nNo offense, but this series is like the collection of the rejections from other franchises. I mean, look at the cast, most of them are comedians and some of them are the category two actors and the rest are, I don't know what they are, bur decent actors. But these films pulled off successfully at the box office. Not a big impact like the recent 'Star Wars' film or any Marvel's films, but quite an impressive figure knowing the above fact I stated.\n\nFrom the Taiwanese director who made four 'Fast and Furious' films, handled his best for this. This film tells the story of the captain James Kirk, who leads his ship and crew to a rescue mission to a distant planet where some alien race who had stranded. But when they reach their destination, an unknown space army takes them by surprise and they too take a refuse on the same planet. From there how they plan to escape and to learn who were those attackers, all comes in the next half.\n\nThis id full of action adventure. The story was little, but quite neatly developed characters, I mean the new ones with some good stunt sequences. As usual, there's no complaint about the graphics. I mean for the casual viewing, but who knows if you carefully look for the flaws, you might get a few. I suggest you to watch it just for an entertainment, but it might fail to satisfy the die-hard fans of 'Star Trek'. I think overall, it is not a bad film, even the two hours long is not an issue due to the good pace. \n\n7/10",

So in this latest installment, we have our Enterprise crew traveling unexplored depths of space, becoming isolated from Starfleet, and having to face a foe that is against everything the Federation stands for.  I know that when you read that, you probably would think that this is a generic, lackluster blockbuster with no personality, and I wouldn't blame you, I even realized how it sounded as I was typing out the words.  It's not.  It feels like a crew on a mission movie, and it has its fair share of surprises, believe it or not.  Now J.J. Abrams has taken a step back, moving from the director's chair to simply being a producer, which does make sense.  He's the guy you get when you are ready to fix what was previously broken; he is sort of like a cinematic mechanic, and then he gives you your car back.  This is also an appropriate analogy, because this was taken over by Justin Lin, the man behind some of the very best movies in the Fast & Furious franchise.  He's much more of an action director, which is exactly what this movie needed, and it was what they were going for with Beyond.  It really is a case of style over substance with the movie that they put together here; you could throw that out as a critique, and I don't think anybody would even try to make an argument against you.  That said, I ended up liking this for what it is: a mission movie.  There's not any deep story to be had with this, it feels like just an episode of the television series that was designed to fit the two hour mark.  The story is nothing special, there's just an unmemorable McGuffin that the crew is working towards and a villain who is just a rendition of the one from the first movie, but that's not what this movie is about.  It's about action sequence, really good looking special effects, and the comradery shared by this crew.  While the overarching story may never sparkle, all of the punch up writing does, and I really appreciated all of the crew interactions with each other; you feel like you're on the bridge with them, and they are so quick with quips and ribbing that it is infectious, and it does help to keep you going in lieu of a sweeping dramatic space opera story.  All of the asides show good chemistry, and sure, the standard story makes it so this is never something I would label as being standout, but I'm still on board with this series, and I want to see where this starship goes next.",

The highlight would be that we really get humor and human moments between our crew; particularly between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. As far as the character dynamics between the three, this film has been the strongest yet. If we're lucky we'll get to see this cast act into their middle ages together, as the first cast did. The only exception being Anton Yelchin, who tragically died shortly before the film was released. Fittingly the film ends with a dedication to Yelchin and the legendary Leonard Nimoy.

Costumes and hardware were abrasive on the eyes,(boyscouts meet woodstock). Is everyone overly tan in the franchise? Too many weird changes from the previous films and TV series. Stylists missed it on the hair. Why the hell did they use a \"Star Trek Wrath of Kahn\" groupshotin the scene with Spock checking Ambassador Spocks possessions?  Over all a rating of 2.5 stars out of 5 stars. Quit trying to make it your own gentilemen, thats how they screwed it in the 70s and 80s.",

Tonnes and Tonnes of action.  Compared to J.J. Abrams' more finessed, more narrative focused, and more character centric handling of Star Trek (2009), Lin goes a little more haywire then what I feel necessary.\nAs proof: the U.S.S. Enterprise is totally dismembered within the first 30 mins (via a kinda cool attack from a swarm of  \"bee\" like droids) when the action comes at you in a fury of fire.\nEven though the CGI and FX teeter-totters between cartoony to visually stunning, the overloaded action takes over and never really stops; making the characters suffer and the narrative plot-holed ridiculous.  Which is kinda sad, because it was co-written by the funny man Simon Pegg - who also plays Scotty in the film (one of the few characters that feels authentic and consistent from the first Star Trek rebook in 2009).\nDon't get me wrong, the last 30 mins of action did get my adenaline going, having me on the edge of my seat adrenaline-ized when the good guys foiled the bad guys.  But with the action and the lackthereof of a plot driven by Chris Pine's Kirk feelings of compassion for an \"escaped\" survivor of a space crew being held captive on a planet within a nebula, the writing of Pegg et al, feels very basic, weak and superficial.  \nChris Pine's Kirk is ok (less funny here, but consistent from 2009).\nZoe Saldnana's Uhura is ok (less screentime here, and less emotional depth).\nJohn Cho's Sulu is fine (and gay).\nKarl Urban's (one of the three given significant screen time) Dr. 'Bones' McCoy's accent is annoyingly too \"put on\" for the first half of the film.\nThe late Anton Yelchin's Chekov is ok.\nZachary Quinto's Spock (the other character aside from Pine's Kirk given some depth) is pretty good: remaining interesting, funny, \"emotionally absent\" as he was in the first one.\nSofia Boutella (covered in white makeup) as Jaylah does her best as the only crucial female who does anything worthwhile.\nNot being a Star Trek junkie (even though I loved watching all of the original Shatner and Nimoy Trek's as a kid; a nod given to at the end), I really liked 2009's Star Trek.  Come  Star Trek Beyond - with overstimulated action and special effects and a completely wasted, Darth Vader breathing, Idris Elba as the paltry villian Krall - I felt there was too much of a dynamic shift in tone and character focus from the first one that left me feeling \"nothing special\" after this one.",

            "content": "I was really excited when I first found out that Simon Pegg, who also plays Scotty, was helping to write the script (along with Doug Jung).  And I was excited because I'm fairly certain that Mr. Pegg is a big fan of the original Star Trek series.  I don't even have to do my research on that, because I just know.  So I'm sure the fact that he got to co-write a Star Trek movie was part of his bucket list.  As far as my excitement to see Mr. Pegg's effort in this movie.  I don't know what to say.  I genuinely liked the movie, it's not even that I didn't like it.  But I just felt that there was something different that would have pushed it to be in the same category as the first two films in the rebooted franchise.  The first film was important because it got the entire group together to establish this world these characters inhabit.  The second movie was important because it deepened Kirk's and Spock's relationship and made it a focal point of the narrative.  This movie, sadly, just doesn't have any of that.  And I'm not saying that the previous films in the rebooted franchise are absolutely essential viewing, though I found both of them to be supremely entertaining, but they at least made an effort to make it seem like you were watching something that was important.  Yea, there might not have been much in the way of consequences from film to film, but each narrative, in a vacuum, was important to the characters at that point in time.  I can't say that with this movie.  They certainly make the effort, but this feels more like an episode of a TV series, if I'm being perfectly honest.  There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but for a major summer blockbuster, it honestly falls a little bit flat.  Particularly in the fact of, say, the release of The Force Awakens late last year that revived the Star Wars franchise with a bang.  They're three films in, with another one planned, into this reboot Star Trek, so they're probably settling into a comfort zone and I feel that this film is representative of that.  I don't wanna say that the film was uninspired, because it's not even close to that, but, like I said, there's no real sense of importance to anything that's happening here.  You know the characters aren't really gonna suffer much in the way of actual consequence.  They may be in trouble, but they'll always fight their way back and win in the end and save the world.  With the unfortunate death of Anton Yelchin, Chekov's character will not be replaced, but that was a situation that was out of their hands.  But I'm sure that the fourth film will be more of the same.  A new villain and dangerous situations that the crew will overcome, fairly, easily.  The most inspired moments of the film come from the addition of a new character in the way of Jaylah.  I really like the character and she's a more than welcome addition to the crew, hopefully she's part of the fourth film.  She'd almost have to be, but I may be off on that.  Another part of the film that I had problems with is the fact that there's just too much technobabble going on.  To the point that I just sort of zoned out and stopped paying attention.  That happened to me a lot during the movie, if I'm being honest.  I just didn't find myself caring that much during some scenes.  The film is still solid, of course, the dialogue, outside of the technobabble, is pretty strong all things considered.  The cast is, as usual, really good here.  So that's not really much of a problem for me.  The problem, as I mentioned, is that this just doesn't feel like an important story that needed to be told in this re-imagined Star Trek.  The action is solid, but it's not like it's outstanding or world-changing.  So, yea, I don't really know what else I can really say about this movie.  It's entertaining and all of that, but it should have been better than it actually was.  If this was a TV pilot, then it would actually be a pretty good starting point.  As the third movie in a series where the previous two movies were really good, this isn't obviously a bit of a comedown.  It's still a solid sci-fi/action flick.  But this is nothing more than just a rental.",

Upon giving a recap to my friend I realized how incredibly lazy and incompetent the writing was for this installment. I Shall now detail the obvious failings of this otherwise well-acted and produced piece of crap. \n  The entire plot of this movie is the traditional 'BIG BAD' obtaining some magical piece of the mystical weapon he's been looking for and blah blah star trek. The twist is (is it a twist when it's Star Trek and they've used it already?) that Big Bad was a Federation captain on a stranded starship that wants nothing more than revenge for leaving him standed. That is literally all we're given to work with here, and they don't drop that hint until an hour and a half into the movie, after commiting to this plot. \n  BUT WAIT! There's more! The Enterprise is attacked by Big Bad's fleet of drones, discovered...on the planet he crashed on and mentioned in the 'captains log' that explains his motivations above. So....not only was he not stranded, but the drones he's using to attack everything thrughout the movie are spacegoing and quite powerful...but hisd motivation is anger at being abandoned? Wha...?\n aaaaaaand to top it all off, Kirk &Co. manage to use the starship Big Bad crash-landed on....to escape the planet and actually mount an attack on the Big Bad drone fleet. Huh? Not only was the crashed ship capable of flight, but it was spaceworthy in under 20 minutes after XXX years (they don't get very specific on the time Big Bad was lost in space, once again lazy writing). \n  But you know they had to crash the Enterprise yet again on a planet (this is Star Trek we're talking about!) so the bad guy could get his magical amulet or whatever the f....thing is. \n\nIt's a shame they wasted good acting and great visual direction on this GIANT TURD of a movie. The lack of any actual plot or character motivations in the movie (Oh wait Spock rescues O'Hura because VULCAN LOVE AMULET BABY!) doesn't really come through until that reveal I mentioned, but by then you've been lied to for an hour and a half so you may not realize it right away.\n  In the end, we never find out wtf that ancient weapon is, how the Big Bad transformed from some alien animal thing to 'almost passible for Human', or what happened to any of the other crew of the crashed-but-functional 'USS Franklin\". \n\n...and seriously, where do I find a dirtbike with a Harley-sounding V-twin that starts AND RUNS after several hundred years lost in deep space? I feel like this machine could solve all of the world's current problems all by itself, no replicators needed. I can't even get my 30-year old Kawasaki to start after a winter in storage.",

Despite not liking the sequel known as \"Into Darkness\" Star Trek Beyond defiantly was a strong film. It was not as good as the first film, but it did bring back that fun action adventure vibe to the franchise.\n\nThe story is still fun and vibrant, but also simple and easy to follow. It makes these characters feel even more alive than they were before and makes you really connect with them in new ways. You fall back in love with Spock and Kirk's relationship again along with the romance between Zoe Saldana's character and Spock. Also a hand clap should be given to Simon Pegg's character too for being a pretty great comedic relief.\n\nThe new characters are also great like Jaylah who I would love to see again if this franchise continues. I absolutely loved her. She had a great personality and I couldn't help but want more scenes with her.\n\nOverall this is a really strong film for Star Trek fans and I think people should check it out!!",

As you might expect from the man who directed the fast and the furious movies, this movie is purely about action.  There is almost zero story telling.  It's as close as you could get to the fast and the furious in space.  It didn't even look good.  Practically every single scene opened with an overhead revolving camera shot.  We get it.  You think it's fun to start every scene that way.  Action sequences were way over the top and not remotely natural or believable.  I think Star Trek is dead.  I suppose the new show could revitalize what made Star Trek great, but I don't see it happening in movie form and certainly not with this pure action director.  It made me sad to watch this.

Lin crafts a great package for fans and movie goers of all kinds.  It's not quite as good as the 2009 \"Star Trek\" or 2013 \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" but it great in its own right (and avoids the series curse with odd numbered films).

            "content": "After numerous delays, a change of director, script issues, and the untimely passing of both Anton Yelchin and Leonard Nimoy, Star Trek Beyond came with a lot of baggage and succeeds at being a pretty fun, summer blockbuster, but pales in quality to the previous J. J. Abrams films. Beyond is the 13th overall Star Trek film released; third in the new rebooted series, and this entry is directed by Justin Lin from The Fast & Furious franchise, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Trek lore with aplomb, however it is all a bit too familiar at this point. The film picks up about 2 years after Into Darkness, with the Enterprise crew around halfway through their 5-year journey and some of the crew, including Kirk, are growing weary of the monotony of space exploration and are ready for a change. Change hits them like a ton of bricks when they intercept a distress call which ends in the ship crash-landing on a nearby planet with the crew completely splintered, giving the cast a great dynamic with unusual pairings, for example: Spock and Bones. The entire Star Trek cast return and are all in top form with Chris Pine still killing it as Kirk, Simon Pegg and Karl Urban bringing the laughs, and Zachary Quinto giving another stellar performance as Spock with the film being dedicated to both Yelchin and Nimoy's memory. The villain is played by the enormously talented Idris Elba in what should have been a menacing and memorable role, but unfortunately he's just one of a few things holding this film back from greatness. The script, co-written by Pegg is very Trek-y and plays like an extended episode of the TV series with the characters on an away-mission, but this is far from cinematic and the film is light on big-ticket action sequences. The villain's motive is also very typical, and though his look and voice are spot-on, his presence is instantly forgettable and fails to leave a decent impression. What this film nails is the character interactions and winking throwbacks to the old series, and even the previous films with a truly bad-ass use of the song, Sabotage! Star Trek Beyond is definitely a disappointment and doesn't compare to the two previous films, but there is certainly enjoyment to be had and die-hard Trek fans will be pleased with what it has to offer!",

The launch of manic vibe into the final frontier does not transform the Trek universe into a ridiculous Fast and Furious ride, it turns out that director Lin together with screen writers Simon Pegg and Doug Jung has made a smart correction not only from story line, actions, humors up until characters but also to further expand the universe in line with its title. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have once again delivered well with the sparks of strong friendship engagement between the two characters thanks to the clever plot, which also allows more breathing rooms for proper development of the supporting cast. Inspired by the scores in Interstellar, composer Michael Giacchino has blended well the rhythms of Zimmer's artwork together with original Trek themes while the mass visual effect is definitely eye-popping and spectacular even if it feels a bit heavily CGIs. It might not sound right to have Lin on board for the third installment at first but his enthusiasm has proven that he is capable of rebooting the series by recapturing the spirit of the original franchise that Trekkers have long been anticipating for.",

The best part in my opinion is the fighting style of the enemy as a whole. They use a tactic of large, yet individualized numbers as they incorporate suicidal tactics when first attacking the Enterprise, something we've hardly ever seen in film. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto shine once again and lead a balanced cast through another interesting, action packed adventure, leaving us with more excitement for the 4th film that'll star Chris Hemsworth as Captain Kurk's father.",

A space western, pure and simple, but what's wrong with that? To my thinking this is the first of this series reboot that embraces that aesthetic wholeheartedly, and so I liked it more. It looks as if they're leaving the old series behind at last and moving to the next step. That's what the title refers to, I think, that they want to go beyond what Roddenberry began. Well good.

Consequently,  my only expectations for this newest installment was just that it would be fun and coherent, but even those low expectations were shattered.  This movie sucks. I mean it really, really sucks. The script is a poorly developed, scattershot attempt at a plot that brings a whole new understanding to the terms \"convenience\" and \"deus ex machina.\" The action, in addition to being totally incomprehensible, stops being engaging when it becomes obvious that nothing is going to harm our young heroes. No matter how many explosions clutter the screen, none of the violence carries any weight because the only victims are expendable redshirts. The villain is poorly developed too, but the film lost all my respect when the plot demands that the Starfleet crew destroy an impossibly formidable drone swarm with the power of a Beastie Boys song.

            "content": "While I was watching throughout the movie, I felt so reminiscent. It's like there is a nice touch to the original Star Trek crew and it was. With two deaths of notable actors in real life, this movie was also a send-off. The movie takes place within the span of three years from the voyages of the starship Enterprise. However, Captain Kirk questions about the voyage itself and what is the true purpose of it and everything else. His thought begins to reflect when him and his crew crashes down a planet after navigating through the nebula. What I was so impressed about this movie is that they used the ship as some kind of plot device, halfway into the story and I thought it was well done. Justin Lin's cinematography that continues the traditional direction since the first film but added in his own style. You can tell it's really his style if you watched the movies he directed, huge example is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.\n\nWe all love the characters that are already established in the first film but we get to see more of their outlook both attitude and personality that they have developed after the years of their five-year mission, which was only a few years so far in the movie. The friendship between Kirk, Spock, and even Bones gets deepened and let's not forget to the rest as well. A nice touch of Ambassador Spock, the one Spock we know all throughout the years, RIP. Which questions the current spock, Zachary Quinto's Spock, on what he will decide for himself. Which brings him conflicted with his dearest friend, Kirk and what he has to say about his decision. It's also the same thing for Kirk as well but in the end, when you watch the movie, you know that bonds like they have are actually unbreakable. Let's just say, they haven't finished their five-year mission and that Captain Kirk loves space exploration as much as I do. It'll be long before he actually becomes Admiral, suffice to say.\n\nStar Trek Beyond is what fans should or would have been looking for. If you're a fan of the original series and perhaps TNG, then you know what I'm talking about? If not, the movie speaks for itself. Venturing into the unknown, facing off a long dreaded oppression, and perhaps what we've always wanted to see: a spectacular space adventure of the alternate reality crew of the Enterprise.\n\nFor what it's worth, this is another good Star Trek movie but I enjoyed Star Trek Into Darkness more. Maybe because Khan was in it and Benedict Cumberbatch did a really awesome job portraying as him. But the whole movie was like \"The Dark Knight\" to me, if you know what I mean but I even love the classic Wrath of Khan movie as well.\n\nWell at least we have another Star Trek movie to watch and I thought it was really great. It's good to know that we're going to have another one and hopefully it has to do with space and time continuum since Thor has signed up for the next Star Trek movie. But we'll see about that. Star Trek Beyond is not just another blockbuster film but a proper send off to not just two notable actors but even a particular song for a particular music group. Interesting and fun to watch.",

You can just hear the dialog at the writing meetings - \"OK, how do we get rid of the Enterprise so we can do the story?\" \n\nVillain crudely drawn and , uttering the most insipid banalities in an artificial bass voice does not make words scary or meaningful. The villain is the worst part of the film by far, and similar to a Marvel/DC villain in shallowness and incomprehensible / childish motivation - nearly to a comical degree but not quite enough.

What is this Star Trek Beyond, some kind of mindless action blockbuster? Absolutely, and in the best possible way! If you like your Star Trek movies deep and philosophical, then back away because Star Trek Beyond is like a shot of adrenaline straight to the heart of the franchise. I might be over-stating that a little, because there is a plot, it just isn't super original and the movie doesn't take much time to explain it either. However, as someone who goes to Star Trek movies strictly looking for a fun time at the cinema, I think I got what I was expecting. I might have enjoyed the story more in the J.J. Abrams films, but this one still kept the entertainment value cranked up to 10. Now let's get into a little more detail on what I liked, and some of the stuff I disliked (because it wasn't perfect.)\n\nThe cast has really settled into their roles. Everyone just feels right as their character, and they have established themselves with unique qualities that set them apart from just being carbon copies of the original TV show cast. I particularly love Karl Urban who makes Bones so amazingly charming despite his surly demeanor. The widely discussed choice to make Sulu a gay character didn't really play a part in the film, to the point where it almost felt cheapened and tacked on. It's like saying \"we have a black character in our movie\" and then having him walk on just to be seen in the background of one scene. Anton Yelchin gets some serious screen time, including one-on-one with Chris Pine which felt good. They even manage to sort of honor his passing, even though all the filming was done when he died, simply by using some clever editing. They also recognized Leonard Nimoy's passing, to the point where it was a significant plot element in the film.\n\nThe 2 major new characters were both great. I loved Sofia Boutella as Jaylah. She was a tough woman who kicked some butt, and she also had a strong motivation. I loved her interactions with the crew (and her stilted English.) This is one character that I hope they will bring back, because she blended well with everyone else in the cast. Also, let's face it, she looks awesome in her alien makeup. Idris Elba is absolutely menacing as Krall, although a lot of that is because of the job done by the makeup and prosthetics. I was a little frustrated with how much his facial expressions where concealed by the bulky alien appearance, but his line delivery keeps the performance strong (and he gets a brief chance to expand the performance at the end.) One last thing about the cast, I would like to make a formal request of J.J. Abrams: \"Dear Mr. Abrams, Please stop shoving Greg Grunberg cameos into everything you produce. The dude stands out like a sore thumb and completely takes me out of every film he appears in. I love all that you do, but your allegiance to this friend of yours has gone far enough.\"\n\nNow let's talk about special effects and action because there was a lot of both. The ground-level combat was acceptable, although it didn't exactly thrill me in any way. The motorcycle moment from the trailer made sense in the film, but it wasn't as exciting after it went on for more than 5 minutes. The magic is what takes place in space and on the star-ships. I was almost giddy with excitement during the space battles, because they were tense and looked amazing from start to finish. There is one moment in the climax when I was basically glowing from excitement and wanted to stand up and cheer. It served as a great culmination of something set up earlier in this film, and a callback to the first film in this reboot series as well. There's one thing I don't think anyone will be able to deny after watching Star Trek Beyond, Justin Lin certainly knows how to choreograph and film action sequences. The look of everything was so stellar that it seems to be custom-made for 3-D (and I hope to go back to the theater and try that soon.)\n\nThe downside to all of this is that the story presentation is weak. While the type of mission they are on might be reminiscent of an episode from the original series, it falls a little short when it comes to any deep philosophical meaning. Also, many of the action sequences are lacking in character stakes. Even when someone appears to be sacrificing themselves you never fully believe they are in real danger. I also thought they made some weird editing choices in the movie. There was one sequence where I genuinely thought \"did I miss something?\" While the scenes that were omitted didn't make the story fall apart (because I've seen movies before and could fill in the blanks easily enough) it was noticeable. I appreciated that Justin Lin wanted to keep this movie as a high-octane thrill ride, but I think some of these establishing scenes are essential to keep the audience grounded in the story you're telling. It doesn't really matter, though, because somehow my analytical brain was able to shutdown through most of this movie and I had a blast. Star Trek Beyond is definitely not a perfect film, but it's one that I'm anxious to go back and watch again (which has been rare this summer.)",

            "content": "The third movie of J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot, directed by Justin Lin, followed the path of the first two: a slowly deteriorating, mildly disappointing reflection of an amazing film franchise. As a big Star Trek fan, this was a movie I was interested in seeing this summer despite my apprehension that the trailer looked a bit chaotic and not very intriguing. In the end, I was disappointed with what I felt was an uninspired and shallow movie with a muddled conflict and without real stakes or consequences.\n\nThe movie begins with Spock and Kirk both questioning their Starfleet career paths and seeking to move onto a new chapter in their lives. Before any developments can happen, the crew is sucked into a rescue mission that goes awry on an alien planet. It is up to the crew, though separated, to work together to escape and defeat the machinations of a mysterious alien who goes by the name Krall.\nThis movie fell apart almost from the outset as the Enterprise crew flies off on this rescue mission with the least amount of exposition possible. \n\nThere were too many competing characters, interpersonal relationships, and storylines going on to develop any of them to a successful, or even a satisfactory, degree. Bones-Spock (obligatory, undeveloped antagonistic friendship), Spock-Kirk (mostly unspoken, undeveloped mutual-respect friendship), Spock-Uhura (token romance with inconsequential break-up quickly resolved), Scotty-Jayla (the one relationship I would have liked to see develop more but couldn't because of wasted screentime), are all interpersonal relationships whose development starts and stops during the film in herky-jerky spurts. We know the relationships between the first three pairs of characters, but the movie nonetheless introduced conflict into these relationships which was quickly resolved each time in a waste of time without true meaning. \n\nThe main victim of all of these inconsequential conflicts was the main conflict between Krall and the Enterprise crew. Despite an interesting premise and the struggle of the crew to coordinate efforts once they split up, we have very little development on the mystery of who Krall is, why he is doing what he is doing, or why the audience should care other than that he's the bad guy until it all comes together in 30 seconds at the end. \n\nThere is also never truly a feeling of danger or loss in that we don't see any main characters in danger or see characters react appropriately to danger or loss. Kirk's actions directly lead to the death of a member of Starfleet and although Uhura seems concerned in the moment, no one else, including Kirk, ever seem bothered by this fact. Most of the battling looked like it took place in a video game without any risk or believability with untouchable characters who were impervious to hurt. \n\nIn the end, all of the conflicts are tied up neatly without any growth, development, or change. Kirk and Spock, of course, spoiler alert, both decide to stay in Starfleet without much (any) prodding and each never bother to discuss their internal struggle with the other. Two supposedly best friends never seem to find the time to discuss that each is considering leaving Starfleet with each other. It is enough to make one wish for the depth and dialogue of the Spock-Kirk relationship in the Wrath of Khan.  \n\nDespite the heavy reliance on Star Trek TOS, I have enjoyed that the reboot movies have used new actors to bring fresh flavor to the old characters. It was also an honorable tribute to two actors who passed away before this film was released - Leonard Nimoy, the original Spock, and Pavel Yelchin who played Anton Chekov. Still, there is no doubt that this movie was the weakest of the reboots thus far and I'd only recommend it to people who feel the need to see every Star Trek movie ever made. Otherwise, you aren't missing anything.",
