Taika Waititi is brilliant! I'm pretty sure I've watched everything that has been released in North America. I can't wait until his next release \ud83d\ude04\n\nThere's some tense scenes and a lot of giggling scenes where I was giggling LOL it's just so good from start to finish.\n\nI highly recommend it if you haven't seen it yet.\n\nIf you loved it before, watch it again and again \ud83d\ude09 I watch it about once a year \ud83d\ude04",

Taika Waititi's Hunt for the Wilderpeople is, like all of Waititi's films, chock-full of quirkiness.  The characters are unique, the dialogue is fresh and funny, the soundtrack is always surprising, and the story is original.  The only potential problem with the movie is the Thelma and Louise-like climax, which feels wildly inconsistent with the tone of the rest of the film.  And always remember, you don't choose the skux life; the skux life chooses you.",

Yet when a subtext about 'No child left behind' is created, what ends up happening is lots of chuckling.  I wouldn't say this movie is the wild ride it aims to be, but nevertheless it is fun and at times funny and the writer/director is talented and has put out several successful films since this one; all these things considered I would recommend this one.",

Here we are presented with the silly oddball characters we've come to know and love from Waititi, and indeed, Sam Niel's deadpan portrayal of an ornery uncle makes him the perfect foil for kid rebel Ricky Baker.  Notably, Waititi doesn't care if the film's plot wanders it means we'll journey towards new treasures and surprises, and for this reason the film really breathes and develops in unexpected and even \"majestical\" ways.  It's a film with a heart the size of Ricky Baker and as is the mark of the greatest of adventure stories, this is an adventure neither you nor the characters will want to end.",

I would 100 percent see this movie again and I can't wait to see what taika watiti does next. Plus the cinematography is phenomenal like the directing and acting.",

It was so much fun watching a boy and a man who are complete opposites form a close father and son relationship. Well with being stuck in the woods for five months while a manhunt conducted by government is after them they don't have a choice but to learn to know one another and form a close, unusual bond.

I've always found that his comedic, dramatic, and visual styles are always blended in a perfect way. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a perfect example of this, if it weren't for Jojo Rabbit, this would definitely be Taika's best. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a story about how family can come from the unlikeliest of places in the hardest times. The protagonist, Ricky Baker, is a perfectly cast teenage rebel who is put into a foster family where he meets Aunty, who really takes care of him. Without spoiling anything, the film really is an emotional roller coaster. Ricky Baker's Journey of learning of life away from being a selfish brat is complimented by the journey of \"Uncle\" Hector, who learns to accept others and open up to new experiences. The film really delves into how relationships can be made in tough situations. Now, all of this makes it sound like an absolute drag, and really, it isn't. This film is absolutely hilarious, and on point with Taika's usual comedic style. Unlike Taika's other work (excluding Thor: Ragnarok), this movie is full of wonderful action. The way that the entire film is set up really makes these extreme action sequences an extreme joy. The soundtrack is also really fun and different. Still, I found that the movie did suffer from quite a few jokes that didn't land. And the ones that did were sometimes done just a little short. At the very end of the movie, I feel like there needed to be more, and another half an hour could have easily made the story a lot more flushed out and complete. Still, this movie checks all of the boxes for me, and it's one of Taika's best. I'll give this one a 9.3/10",

Incredible acting to be able to portray these deeply wounded characters as bitter and cold in one moment, deeply longing and vulnerable in another, and then just completely hilarious in others. The story is beautiful (bless you Bella, you sweet, wonderful angel, too good for this world) and heartfelt and yet at the same time, you laugh through most of the movie. It doesn't remotely go in a direction you expect (at least not one I expected) despite initially seeming like it might be a familiar tale, it takes constant twists and turns through a delightfully deranged plot and keeps you constantly engaged while defying expectations. This is truly a perfect movie. I wouldn't change a thing ... except that I wish I saw it when it came out three years ago!!\n",

Youthful Julian Dennison is a great fit for the part, playing the hard-edged wannabe thug with a straight face while smoothly indulging the sillier ticks and quirks that make it clear he's still young at heart. Sam Neill, nearly unrecognizable beneath a thick white beard and thicker local accent, makes a fine addition as his gruff, prickly counterpart; a bitter, lonesome man who still harbors the spark of warmth beneath several prohibitive outer layers.\n\nSweet and genuine, effortlessly funny and smoothly charming, it's partly Napoleon Dynamite, partly Wes Anderson and partly its own thing entirely.",

            "content": "If there's one thing director Taika Waititi's known for, it's making something strange work. He most famously took Thor, a huge character in the massively successful Marvel Cinematic Universe, and completely reworked him from the ground up. Waititi made him funnier and added his signature quirk to that franchise, breathing new life into it. That style is as prevalent as ever in Waititi's adventure comedy, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, which he both wrote and direct. Sam Neil plays a bushman from New Zealand, who pairs up with Julian Dennison, portraying the juvenile delinquent orphan brought into his life, to form the kind of oddball, reluctant buddy combinations that work so well in these types of movies. \n\nThough the previous paragraph states, \"these types of movies,\" there aren't many like this one. The buddy act is familiar, but everything else about the premise and setup feel unique. Ricky Baker (Dennison) is a hip-hop loving orphan who has been bounced around from foster home to foster home. To avoid juvenile detention, he joins Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and Hector (Neil), who live on a farm near the New Zealand bush. Bella is welcoming and endearing, though Hector is a bit distant. The strange new family ends up working out for everyone, until a tragic event puts Ricky on course to get sent back into child protective services. It sends him and Hector on a journey to avoid capture through the bush, thus forming the titular \"wilderpeople.\"   \n\nThe past work of writer/director Taika Waititi was brought up earlier and for good reason. If you've seen and enjoyed his work in the past, you'll almost undoubtedly have a good time here. The quirky style of humor that made Thor: Ragnarok such a blast is evident here. Weird is funny and weird is Taika's calling card. The films blends so many things together to make for a unique experience. There's Ricky jamming to imaginary music while Hector watches in confusion. You have Bella killing a boar in front of Ricky in a gory, yet funny scene. There's also Ricky naming his dog after his favorite rapper/best friend, Tupac.\n\nAs noted, something about weirdness works excellently in Taika's favor. It's not just the case with the script, but with things like the music choices and the shots we get of the bush. For example, there's a blend of tracks included in the movie that fit the likes of the characters, as well as tone set from start to finish. Waititi did a strong job of using overhead shots panning across the bush to showcase just how immense it was. It really helped solidify the gravity of the situation for Ricky and Hector. The fact that it's a seriously frightening world for our heroes, yet it's brilliantly offset by the script and tone that Waititi puts together, is exactly why this film stands out.\n\nThere's also an interesting look on the class these characters come from. Neither are rich or well off, but they're still very different people. Ricky mostly embodies the kind of kid you'd expect from his generation and upbringing. He enjoys his music and the \"gangster\" life, while knowing nothing of the wilderness. When he gets told by Hector to use a leaf as toilet paper, it's a small exchange, yet one that captures why these two polar opposites work so well together. Their differences are the perfect ones to capture in the environment the film takes places in.\n\nUltimately, this is a movie that takes you on an enjoyable journey and is recommended, especially if you're looking for a laugh. There's a strong blend of action, suspense, surprising emotional beats, and great comedy. Waititi takes a somewhat simple premise and injects his brand of weird humor into it, turning it into something special. One watch of this film next to Thor: Ragnarok or Waititi's What We Do In The Shadows, and you can clearly see it all fits together. A Waititi film feels like a Waititi film from start to finish. That's a good thing.",

With it being an independent film I was hesitant, as I have not enjoyed too many of those types (although I do not view many of them). But I have to say, whoever cut their trailer did an amazing job. The trailer was so good that I feared it would outperform the movie. Luckily I was not disappointed. I think Sam Neill put it best when he said that this movie is not a comedy. It is a serious movie with funny things happening all around it. You will be laughing through much of the movie, but then the next moment you might be brought to tears. One of my favorite aspects of the movie is the realism and the freshness. If you are looking for a typical Hollywood blockbuster movie, then you will not find it here; and that is a good thing. The music, dialogue, and acting comes from fresh sources in New Zealand, and make for a new experience. One thing I like most about movies is being able to get sucked into the realism of it. It would not take too much to imagine this really happening. Just as nice as it is to have a veteran actor like Sam Neill, the new actors and actresses that this movie brings to the forefront shows that there are many more talented people out there than we may think. Everyone gave stunning performances. It makes me happy to know that some of them are moving on into Hollywood roles (like with Thor Ragnarok). The only reason for the lack of a full five stars is the amount of inappropriate language in it. That is something I find to be tactless and distasteful. I understand strong language in appropriate moments, but overuse of it shows a lack of imaginative dialogue. Overall I highly recommend you go see this movie.",

When that balance is achieved, you end up with a well-written character, but you're faced with another challenge: finding a performer capable of embodying that character. Thankfully, Julian Dennison does a perfect job alongside Sam Neill in this story of a foster kid who ends up in a home that is actually a nice place. It's a movie that shows that if you have a good heart, you can pass it to those whom you care about. Rachel House's hilarious performance as Paula, the Javert-like Child Welfare agent, shows that a job title isn't enough to actually have a heart.",

The plot is well thought out, and moves at a fast enough pace to deliver an authentic sense of adventure. A rather different coming of age film, this film tackles some heavy issues in its own light hearted manner.

Some character interactions often seem too random and incidental and, as a result, feel unearned. Additionally, Waititi's directing can sometimes feel inconsistent and distracting, depicting the characters' literal journey in a manner that makes it seem rushed and unconvincing. \nUltimately, it's through Hunt's for the Wilderpeople's charming leads and jaunty tone that makes the film average at best. 2.5/5",

A comedy from New Zealand with a lot of heart, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is about Ricky, a defiant city kid who is getting a fresh start with a foster family in the countryside. However when tragedy strikes he and his uncle Hec go into the wild and a crazy man hunt ensues. This is such a fun film, Julian Dennison as Ricky is absolutely hilarious and charismatic and Sam Neill as the curmudgeonly Hec is wonderfully dry in his humour. Rhys Darby also has a great little part as Psycho Sam and Rachel House as Paula is perfectly straight faced and funny as a child welfare worker who hates kids. The premise of the grumpy old man transformed by a loveable young scamp isn't exactly an original premise but this film hits such a good balance between the fantastical, humorous, sad and sweet that you can't help but love it.",

It tells of a young man who has been shuffled through the foster care system, but he just might have found a place where he belongs. However when the situation changes he\u0092s at risk of being sent back into the system, so he must go on the run. The adventure of Ricky and Hec through the wild is funny and endearing. It has all the elements of a good road trip movie and a good man-on-the-run movie combined.\n\nJulian Dennison was basically an unknown before this movie, but I expect him to become a big name soon. He's got great comedic timing, and plays the emotional stuff well, which is a combo that can be hard to find in young actors. Sam Neill is perfect as the straight man throughout the film. He seems to be channeling a little of Alan Grant and has that reluctant fatherly connection with the young boy. Also of note is Rachel House who plays a psychotic CPS worker that adds so much comedy to the film. \n\nFor me, the strongest part of Hunt for the Wilderpeople is the humor. It isn't exactly laugh-out-loud hilarity, but it features characters who make a number of incongruous choices that had me chuckling a lot. The character development is also strong for the two leads so I did care about their journey. I guess my only real complaint is that the emotional moments didn't hit me all that hard. I cared but never felt personally engaged in any way. Despite this I'm quite excited for Waititi to direct the next Thor film, because I think he could make it something unique and special.",

Layer on top Taika Waititi's fantastic whit and quirky style, and the happiness-factor is only upped, resulting in a rather poetic, genuinely wonderful film indeed.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It is fairly simple, but its appeal is well-routed.\nVERDICT: One of the best films of 2016, and one of my personal all-time favourites - this film's got soul, and that triumph sits mostly in the hands of Taika Waititi.",

            "content": "Hunt for the Wilderpeople Will Leave You Feeling Silly \n\nHunt for the Wilderpeople is honestly one of the quirkiest films I've seen in awhile, in the vein of Flight of the Conchords and Arrested Development. While the film is packed full of laughs, delightful one liners and a myriad of unpredictable circumstances, the message and content are a little bit heavier. The flick insightfully contrasts the need we all feel to belong to a family with the process of overcoming the feelings of vulnerability and wariness that come from letting ourselves care about other people and depend on them. Packed all together, Hunt for the Wilderpeople will make you feel all the feels and still leave you positively beaming. \n\nAs Ricky, (Julian Dennison), is dropped off at a farm on the edge of the New Zealand bush, the portly 10-year-old realizes his dreams of the thug life may have come to an abrupt halt. Ricky \"the real bad egg\" Baker has been in and out of foster and group homes all his life, and Ricky knows his new placement at the farm is his last shot to be part of a family before he's sent to juvenile detention. His new Auntie Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and Uncle Hec (Sam Neill) take a different approach to his care than previous foster parents; Bella is unperturbed by his attempts to run away and ignores his glum attitude, while Hec just plain ignores him. In fact, when Ricky asks Hec if there is anything he can do to help out on the farm, Hec firmly tells him to just \"stay out of my way\". Despite their individual quirks, such as Ricky's penchant for expressing himself via haiku and Bella's overbearing cheer, the little group grows into something resembling a family. \n\nWhen tragedy strikes the budding family, leaving Hec a widower and Ricky without a mother figure, social-services opts to take the child out of the less than perfect situation. However, Ricky is reluctant to be another kid lost in the system, and decides to take matters into his own hands.  Thinking he can carve out a life on his own, he runs into the bush. It's soon apparent that his questionable survival skills won't be enough to keep him out of trouble, and surprisingly, Hec, with his wilderness know-how, comes to his rescue. Whilst making their way out of the bush, Ricky discovers that Hec is unable to read and taunts him about his ineptitude. When Hec gets angry and chases after Ricky, an accident renders Hec unable to leave the forest, forcing the duo to begrudgingly spend several weeks together in the wild.\n\nAs the pair spend time together they begin to learn to rely on each other. With Hec being unable to walk, he has to tell Ricky how to find food and buld shelter to keep them alive. When they get into a scuffle with a couple of hunters, Ricky uses his street knowledge (namely a rifle and some choice words) to save Hec from the men that want to separate them. One of my favorite scenes shows Hec and Ricky snuggled up in sleeping bags next to the campfire, and Ricky is reading to Hec. It's heartwarming and hilarious to watch as they grow to lean on each other and recognize that they are stronger when they work together. Not only that, but that it's preferable to let other people into our lives and hearts than try to do everything alone. \n\nDirector Taika Waititi (\"Boy\" and \"What We Do in the Shadows\") turns prominent New Zealand writer Barry Crump's story, \"Wild Pork and Watercress\", into a deeply inspiring and off-the-wall comedy flick that everyone can enjoy. While the wacky situations throughout the film (my favorites include the Happy Birthday song and Lord of the Rings reference) move the story along, Julian Dennison and Sam Neill steal the spotlight in this eccentric adventure. They perfectly demonstrate the internal struggle involved with the almost alien act of opening up and being vulnerable with those you care about. Ricky and Hec's transformation from two closed off loners to an unlikely family makes this film truly \"majestical\".",

            "content": "Hunt for the Wilderpeople: A uniquely emotional comedic relief\n\nA heart wrenching, gut-busting, comedy-drama film, Hunt for the Wilderpeople makes it to the top of the list when it comes to best films of 2016. This quirky, yet lovable movie is beautiful not only in the cinematography but the development of the emotions both in the characters and audience. Young Ricky Baker played by Julian Dennison is a 13-year-old foster-child wannabe gangster. He's placed in the hands of the quiet Uncle Hec (Sam Neil) and affectionate Aunt Bella (Rima Te Waita) on their small farm in the middle of New Zealand. Life takes an unexpected turn forcing Ricky and Uncle Hec to travel deep into \"the Bush\" on the run from child welfare officer Paula (Rachel House).\n\nIt's a completely ridiculous storyline yet somehow director, Taika Waititi pulls it all together to create another brilliant piece of art similar to his other witty-natured movies Eagle vs Shark and Boy. His prominent style throughout most of his films include the occasional prolonged scene creating that on-edge humor that can feel cringe worthy, but also makes it absolutely impossible not to laugh. The awkward but endearing moment between Ricky and Hec, sharing their haikus is the scene that makes this movie so noteworthy. These are two of the most closed off characters when it comes to expressing emotions. Within one scene, those emotional barriers break down to expose the true feelings of these rugged outlaws. Waititi masters capturing this heartwarming scene through the perfect balance of humor and affection, proving that it doesn't take tears to get an emotional point across.  \n\nWith a Wes Anderson style, the whole movie is both pleasing to the eye, all while tugging at your heart strings. It's hard not to enjoy the character Ricky Baker; haikus and all. With his eye for simplicity, Waititi sets a high standard for future comedy-drama films. This artsy film is overflowing with incredibly simple, yet stunning visuals. Because it's based off of the book, Wild Pork and Watercress by Barry Crump, he brilliantly overlays the chapter headings from the book onto beautiful shots of New Zealand countryside as transitions from one part of the storyline to the next, giving it the storybook kind of feel. The whole film captures the beauty of New Zealand on a deeper level with Ricky, Uncle Hec, and their loyal dogs traveling through some of the thickest rainforests with only their keen sense of adventure to guide them.\n\nExperiencing this film is honestly an adventure of your own. Throughout the piece it's not completely clear what you should be feeling, but that doesn't take away the fact that its charming, fun, emotional, and appealing. It will leave you with a sense of awe for the world of filmmaking and the minds that come up with these exceptional art pieces. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is ultimately an extraordinary rare masterpiece.",

Neill\u00e2??s character is at home on a ragged mountain peak as he is in his own living room, and he has little in common with young Ricky\u00e2??who is obsessed with gangster rap. Neill\u00e2??s wife in the movie, Bella, takes young Ricky in over Neill\u00e2??s protestations and despite the young man\u00e2??s record of stealing, spitting, graffittiing, burning and various other anti-social behaviors. The relationship between 60-something Neill and young Ricky changes\u00e2??and is frequently challenged\u00e2??as the two become the two most wanted persons in New Zealand. In their travels, they meet several engaging characters, including the hilarious Rhys Darby (Murray from \u00e2??Flight of the Conchords). New Zealand has produced a couple of my favorite movies in recent years, including the hilarious vampire comedy \u00e2??What We Do In The Shadows\u00e2?? and the most-metal-of-all horror comedies, \u00e2??Deathgasm.\u00e2?? \u00e2??Wilderpeople\u00e2?? is easier to recommend than those two comedy classics because it\u00e2??s a very mild PG-13 that will engage both parents and their kids\u00e2??even if they\u00e2??re not yet teens or, like mine, are about 18.

            "content": "Maybe it's just me or maybe it's just the fact that I'm on this side of the world, but I find that Taika Waititi is really underrated as a comedy filmmaker.  Even though some of his films (at least Boy and this one) contain some dramatic content.  Then again, he might not be underrated considering that he is directing the next Thor movie, so I have high hopes for that.  Anyway, the point of it all that I find Mr. Waititi to be an immensely talented filmmaker and actor.  One of the (many) things that I liked about Taika's style is that he clearly knows how to get the most out of his actor and he has a great eye for developing characters.  Even What We Do in the Shadows, a straight-up comedy, has some truly great and memorable characters.  Admittedly speaking, however, when compared to his previous two movies, this isn't as good as either of those two.  And that isn't even suggesting that this movie is bad, that's just how great Boy and Shadows really are.  I haven't seen Eagle vs Shark yet, so I wouldn't know what to say about that.  As it stands, there's a reason that this movie is the highest grossing film in New Zealand ever.  Which honestly, as good as this movie actually is, I find surprising, considering that the Lord of the Rings trilogy was filmed in New Zealand by a New Zealand director.  Maybe that trilogy wasn't as massive there as it was over here, which is entirely possible.  Either way, the fact of the matter is that this is a damn good movie with a strong focus on character development.  It's also a really funny movie as well.  It might not be as hilarious as Shadows.  While the comedy is Shadows was, overall, more laugh-out-loud than this movie, I think this movie was far more consistent.  Shadows dragged a little bit, whereas this movie didn't really drag.  I think that may be because there's also more than just comedy going on here, there's a narrative of the growing relationship between Ricky and Hector, Ricky's foster parent, after Hector's wife and Ricky's foster mother, a lovely woman, passed away due to a heart attack.  At least I assume since they didn't actually confirm her cause of death.  After her death, Ricky and Hector go on the run from the government, as they want to take Ricky back to juvenile hall.  Ricky's having none of this.  The movie gets some comedy from this, as during the manhunt that, in the climax, even the military gets involved (yes), it is rumored that Hector has been...sexually inappropriate with Ricky.  He obviously hasn't, but its silliness work in this setting.  And it's not like they harp on it too much, because that might have brought the movie to a darker place that they didn't want the story to go.  The narrative is pretty much what you would expect, since Hector starts out as a typical grumpy old man with Ricky.  Obviously, as the film progresses, Ricky and Hector start spending more time together and they start to grow fond of one another.  You've seen it before and you'll see it again.  But this movie does it with humor, heart and intelligence.  It also helps when you have a talented actor like Sam Neil as Hector.  Which brings us to Julian Dennison, who plays Ricky.  This kid is, quite honestly, a fucking natural.  The editing obviously has a lot to do with choosing the best takes, but the effort from the actor still has to be there.  And, like I said, the kid is a natural.  He's great in this movie.  He's likable, he's charismatic, surprising for someone his age, and, most importantly, he's funny.  He plays perfectly off of Sam Neil.  The supporting cast is really strong as well.  Rhys Darby has a memorable appearance as a conspiracy theorist who helps Ricky and Hector.  Taika has a role himself as the priest in one of the more memorable scenes of the entire movie.  If there's one thing you can't complain about, it's the cast.  Is the film sentimental?  In my view, no, not really.  At least not super sentimental, yes, there's some sweet moments or the end scene with the Ricky and Hector bantering.  But, and here's the difference, the movie earned those moments.  They're not forced upon you by characters you didn't care about.  At least that's how I see it, there's no big reunion between Ricky and Hector where a rousing, inspiration score plays in the background.  There is a reunion, but they don't make a big deal out of it, which is how it should be done.  With that said, the movie isn't perfect, it falls very short of hitting the great mark, but this is a real good movie that I would easily recommend.  It's an easy, funny watch with strong characters.  Can't go wrong with that.",
