The problem with the movie is that it is a bit unfocused and tries to touch on too many topics. I am aware that Bollywood movies tend to be longer, but this movie has no justifiable reason to be nearly three hours long. Because of the lack of focus, the movie can feel scrambled and started to drag for me. Despite some flaws in storytelling, the best part of this movie is the lead performance from the now late Sushant Singh Rajput. In the few movies I saw this actor in, I always feel like he was able to come off as instantly likable, which is so important for a biopic of this nature. This movie is one of many reminders that a talented young actor is now gone from the world. Overall, this is a good sports biopic despite some messy storytelling because of a charming and likable lead performance.",

            "content": "We know him as Dhoni, but this is the tale of Mahi.\n\nUsually Indian film fans are divided according to the regions. Because if you turn any corner in that country, there's another film industry, another English alphabet replaced to rhyme with Hollywood. They have got their own bunch of actors, filmmakers and films. They might be divided over films and film productions, but they always united when it comes to cricket.\n\nRemember one and a half decade ago an Indian film about the same sport made into the Oscars, but did not win. This film was based on the life of one of the greatest Indian and world cricket player. So length into breadth of the India, it was a highly anticipated sport-biographical film. India has a long history of cricket. It was brought into the country by the British nearly half a millennium ago. It is called a gentlemen's game, which means only rich and royal people can play.\n\nSo in India, cricket was always been a game highly influenced in big cities. Players from those places are high in demand till recently. Talents from second and third tier cities never been noticed. But some player made it because of political and other sort of influence. That's changed forever when Mehendra Singh Dhoni's success inspired millions of people. Made youngsters to take bat and ball believing someday they can play for their state or in the national team.\n\nIf you are an Indian, I'm sure you had heard many things about him, his difficult path to stardom. There's nothing much difference in the life journeys of his and Shivaji Rao Gaekwad. They both were ticket sellers/collectors. Struggled through to initiate their profession, but in a different field. Now they're superstars.\n\nIn Indian films, it's only recently the trend had started in biopics. For a cricketer, it is an ideal initiation. Remember Sachin Tendulkar's documentary film is due to release in this summer, but it is an international project. It can't be neglected because of his hardcore fans, not just in India, but across the world. He had retired a while ago, but still fans chant his name during the recent games.\n\nI know this director, since one of his films was remade as 'Someone Like You'. Bollywood films are always very stylish, but slips away while depicting realism of India, Indian society and culture. That's where I lost interest in them. I watched it for MS, since he plays/played for my team CSK who is known as Thala.\n\nSeems funny, some of the lines that translated into Tamil. But culture wise, it is understandable. A boy was born on the 7th of July '81, but soon the narration shifts focus on his childhood in the late 80s. A fine football goalkeeper, but changed his sport after an unexpected offer. Extremely interested in batting, but his opportunity was being a wicket keeper.\n\n?You won't face the same ball always in your life. You've to play on your merit and just hang in there. The scoreboard will keep ticking along.?\n\nWhen he enters his teenage, he had learnt to play his own method. Particularly in batting which is the least given privilege to him by his coach. Supportive parents, but from above that, the great friends gang, he had with him at all the good and bad times. The first half is all about the cricket. In fact the whole film was about him and the cricket, the rest of his life was not concentrated enough. I mean on other stuffs, except the romance that takes off during the beginning of the second half. So basically that's where you will come to know this guy is a man with feelings and emotions like you and me.\n\nWe all knew him as a cricketer, a great cricketer to say. Since his romance parts come into play, for a brief moment the sport was set aside. A love story kick starts. All those who believed he's a superhuman, will come to realise after witnessing Bollywood style of romance, which is basically how happens in real India. He's not an emotion showing type, especially in public or during the game. But there's a scene in the film and when it appears, that's really heartbreaks. No offense, but it looked Sakshi demanded a proposal than expecting it to come her way naturally.\n\nThe three hours is too long for a film, but for this film I felt they had left out many things with short scenes/events, otherwise it would have gone past the four hour mark or even higher. So two part film would have made it a better product, but I'm happy for it to be a single film.\n\nI was bothered about the songs, but they smartly merged them with the storytelling. Particularly commercial films can't afford to lose the blue print of Indian cinema, since songs are the free television commercial, to popularise the film prior to its release. All the actors were great. The lead actor was at his best, especially when it comes to the technics in the games to match the Dhoni's style of play. Most of the locations are the actual locations, including the school, grounds and house(s). I think it was a good move.\n\nThe film was not entirely true. They have changed the events to suit the cinematic. A man's 30 years of life journey to put into a 3 hour film, it has to be done and they did it neatly in Indian style. Some people are complaining about this and that, but that's understandable if you understand the concept of filmmaking, particularly money making film.\n\nOnly the first two acts were very gripping. The final act was predictable, if you are an ardent cricket follower. Because you know everything on field about this man which is what covered in those parts. And the rest of the film was like behind the scenes of a film called his life. This is a wonder film, and I know the majority of the Indians won't miss it or had already watched it. But for the outsiders, this is not a bad flick, even if you don't know the sport or the player. Worth a try, otherwise definitely recommended.\n\n8/10",

            "content": "When I first heard that director Neeraj Pandey was making a biopic on a man who's widely regarded as the greatest ever captain to have served Indian cricket, I couldn't help but wonder if he had got his timing disastrously wrong.\nDhoni, after all, continues to serve the national team in all limited overs formats, and a film of this nature would probably have been better served if it delayed its production until the point when he, as is inevitable, walks into a glorious sunset - one that's destined to remain unparalleled in its magisterial beauty.\nThis skepticism, however, was dispelled when I watched MS Dhoni: The Untold Story.\nPandey, after all, is the man who made the wonderful A Wednesday, and his magic touch remains intact.\nThe film remains effective for the most part, thanks in large measure to the incredible life story that it addresses with an almost reverential eye for detail.\nThe best parts of the film are those that underline Dhoni's struggles as a young man, and the many difficult decisions that he had to make over the course of his rather dramatic life.\nSushant Singh Rajput is excellent as Dhoni - he brings a much-needed touch of vulnerability to a man whose aura, to this day, remains one of calmness and detachment.\nIf there's one major grouse I had with the film though, it's the fact that the treatment of its source material remains largely soap-operatic in nature.\nIndeed, the film is replete with caricatures- ones that are painted in the broadest of strokes.\nMS Dhoni: The Untold Story is a solid, watchable film that deserves to be celebrated for the perennially uplifting theme that it highlights: the classical rise of the underdog.\nThere's no denying this fact though: Captain Cool deserved a little better.",

            "content": "Making a film based on a sport like a cricket is not an easy job, with its extensive game play and every crucial minute, its hard to pick out what's required and what's not. Its obvious how the only successful Bollywood film based on the beloved sport happens to be a fiction tale taking place during the British rule (Lagaan). And after recent debacle of the Emraan Hashmi starrer Azhar, it was abundantly clear that the audience is not ready to except a sports film no matter how popular or controversial the key character is, on the big screen. But with director Neeraj Pandey helming a film based on the beloved Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who played a key role in lifting the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011 against Sri Lanka after a long hiatus of 28 years, somehow just seemed like a good idea, especially keeping in mind that Neeraj Pandey's previous ventures A Wednesday, Special 26 and Baby were highly appreciated by the critics and the audiences. So how does the film fare? Duh, Neeraj Pandey has scored again! The film maker has successfully combined sports, drama, emotion and the right amount of thrills to provide a take on Dhoni's life without hurting his fans and followers. We get to see how this sports icon of India, grows up as a child in a province which discourages sports as means of making a living, the numerous struggles to gain acceptance, the subtle behind the scenes machinations, political maneuvers, highs and lows, extreme disappointment and despair, the almost drowning like sensation of feeling trapped as a misfit in the stagnant existence and finally summing up the courage to break free. The 190 minutes run time of the film, which is quite long compared to any of the film released in recent years but even then the drama doesn't falter much and justifies its length. The credit for this goes to the crisp editing and an equally supportive screen writing by Neeraj Pandey and Nandu Kamte. The story follows Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput), the current captain of the Indian Cricket team. His story unfolds on screen, right from his birth in Ranchi. He used to love football as a child, especially as a goalkeeper and even when he was asked whether he would prefer to learn and play cricket, he shrugged the idea itself since he felt that what good sport it would be with small balls. His father Pan Singh Dhoni (Anupam Kher) is a pump operator, who as usual parents is very protective about his children's studies. Dhoni has an elder sister Jayanti (Bhumika Chawla). His mother is a simple housewife, mostly plays the role of a mediator between children and husband. But it was his school's cricket coach\u00a0KR Banerjee (Rajesh Sharma) who persuades Dhoni to try his hand in wicket keeping. Although initially he gave Dhoni more opportunities to be a wicket keeper, later he recognizes Dhoni's potential in striking the ball. With the help of his friends and well wishers, the film takes us through Dhoni's journey from playing for clubs to his matches as part of Junior Cricket Team in Bihar, Bihar Cricket Team, Jharkhand Cricket Team, meeting fellow beloved future team mate Yuvraaj Singh (Herry Tangiri) for the 1st time, his job stint as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur Railway Station, his secret relationship with his deceased girl friend Priyanka (Disha Patani), his first meeting with current wife Sakshi (Kiara Advani) to ultimately leading India as a captain. The first half of the film is that part of Dhoni's life which we don't actually know. His childhood, his family, friends and the people around him. And the second half is mainly his personal and love life and his International career as the Indian Captain. Coming to the first half, it is comparatively much better than the second half the sole reason of which being; it is the lesser known part of his life. His struggle has been shown to us in a way that is relatable to the people of all age groups. The biggest plus point of first half are the characters supporting MS Dhoni to reach his goal. The cricketing scenes in the film have been handled beautifully and provide the necessary excitement to the audience.\u00a0Then comes the second half, although it is entertaining with the two leading ladies adding up to the romantic life of the Cricketer, the film does gradually slow down\u00a0until the roaring climax kicks in. The director has done a decent job of capturing the emotional hits taken along the journey of life. Right from the start, this is a fairy tale disguised as an underdog story. This is not to say that the film isn't faithful to the broader details of Dhoni's life and career. It's the treatment: the way things fall into place the way they rarely do in real life. When, as a young football enthusiast, he's first handed wicket-keeping gloves, he drops the first few catches, then latches on to everything after that. Batting in the nets for the first time, he hits the first ball back over the bowler's head. Throughout the film, there are only a few instances of Dhoni being dismissed; getting out, apparently, is for mortals. Working with co-writer Dilip Jha, writer-director Neeraj Pandey uses the intermission to divide the Dhoni saga (from childhood till the 2011 World Cup) into two halves that could have been titled \"persistence\" and \"payoff\". We're shown how Dhoni's hitting makes him a legend in his school, then in his hometown of Ranchi; how he misses his chance to play for the U-19 team; how he takes a job as a ticket collector in the hope of representing Railways in the Ranji Trophy. As Dhoni's career seems to grind to a halt-like the trains he's supposed to keep tabs on-the film stalls as well. But intermissions (and their effect on screenplays) are strange things. When the film resumes, Dhoni is quickly elevated to the India A team, then to the national side. For once, instead of being told how special Dhoni is, we see his greatness reflected in their reactions. Apart from a brilliantly cast Herry Tangiri as a young Yuvraj Singh, the film avoids having actors play the Indian team of the time. Instead, it inserts Rajput as Dhoni into actual match footage. It's the film's one big gamble. On the one hand, the makers no longer have to run the risk of looking silly while recreating moments that cricket fans know by heart. Yet, this approach also results in a lack of immediacy. We never feel the heat of the moment, never hear the crowd's chants as Dhoni would have heard them. The film runs through the major signposts in Dhoni's career, but we never get a sense of how victory and defeat affected the man or altered his game or personality. The 2007 World Cup loss, after which his effigy was burnt outside his home in Ranchi, is widely regarded as a turning point in his life. Here, it just comes and goes-a little detail in the inexorable rise of Dhoni. It seemed director Neeraj Pandey just wanted Dhoni to be shown a dutiful son, an attentive boyfriend and an entirely successful Indian team captain, whose level-headedness and fierce attacking style on the field wins Indian many crucial games, including the World Cup in 2011.\u00a0The film is less a study of psyche than of personality. But within its hagiographic constraints, Pandey and lead actor Sushant Singh Rajput assert themselves admirably. The most compelling portions that depict the trudge into the spotlight are all in the first 100-odd minutes, tracing Dhoni's school-level breakthroughs with the guidance of his physical trainer, and encouragement from a supportive mother and sister and loyal friends. This propels him out of the small orbit of Ranchi into the huge outer world.\u00a0Sushant Singh Rajput's tremendous acting and dedication deserve a big thumbs up. He had a challenging role and his hard work showed in the way he projected MSD, in terms of looks as well as expressions. After delivering a classic performance in last year's Detective Byomkesh Bakshy, he shines out this time too. As a lead, his dedication towards becoming Dhoni is fantastic. From gaining the weight as Dhoni to setting a hairstyle like him, he just delivered his best. His 150 days of cricket training clearly speaks out loud when he strikes the ball with a helicopter shot. He is a real actor of today's generation. Anupam Kher, Rajesh Sharma, Kumud Mishra and Bhumika Chawala are good in supporting roles. Disha Patani & Kiara Advani do an excellent job. On the whole, 'M.S.Dhoni: The Untold Story' is a magnificent biopic with an apt screenplay and commendable performances that takes us through one man's triumph that lead the nation to its much awaited victory. The film should not be missed by anyone who has ever admired Dhoni nor by Sushant fans. Others can still watch it for being a wholesome family product.",

The first half is superb mainly because it uncovers the young Mahi and his aspirations. Although his father insists him to focus on his studies yet he finds supporters in his friends, sister and mother. Lines like \"Maahi Maar rha hai\" are truly riveting when he smashes the ball out of the boundary line. Sushant singh rajput potrayal of Dhoni is brilliant. Even at the critical juncture of the film his character is appealing especially when he is stuck in kharagpur as ticket collector but his determination to make it big despite odd failures. However the second half becomes not only boring due to the romantic track along with the songs but also several things never get mentioned like his approach as India's captain or controversies associated with him, instead it comes out as a complete hagiography. It never really tells you about the insight of his character, his captain cool stature or his relations with other players.Though the film stands at 190 minutes long but the Climax scene of dhoni's extraordinary innings in the finals of 2011 world cup and finishing it off with a six gives you goosebumps. I am going in with 3.5/5 for this movie.",

            "content": "If you are a die-hard fan of Dhoni, this film would unquestionably be\nawesome for you. Despite its overrated glorification, what makes it a\ngood film is the hard work put by Sushant Singh Rajput in precisely\nportraying the inspirational story of a middle-class boy from Ranchi\nwho made it big; from a ticket collector to the captain of the Indian\nCricket Team. However, this film does not cover any of the hard\ncontroversies Dhoni had been a part of. His incompetency with the elder\nplayers (Sehwag and Gambhir), rivalry with Yuvraj and the love hate\nrelationship with media and the BCCI board went mostly unseen. But as\nyou see the film from Dhoni's eyes, the movie is quite justified as one\nhardly find himself faulty for any decisions. All in all, the film has\nhit enough sixes to keep the chant 'Dhoni Dhoni' alive in the theaters. \n\nMy prediction on BO Collections: 114cr-120cr",

            "content": "The movie a bit slow to start with! By the time interval sign appears on the screen you would have at least looked at your watch once. Although the movie picks up really well in the second half and finishes just how Dhoni would finish a match. Thought the supporting actors acted really well and ensure one end is safe while Sushant played a gem of an innings by his acting at the other end. There are so many lovely and touching moments in the movie which will either give you goose bumps or at least motivate you. Really liked the movie and great to see/ know the events behind of scene of \"Dhoni in making\" !! You will enjoy it even more if you follow cricket and it will probably take you back in your memories where you witnessed India lifting the World Cup!! Must watch for a Indian cricket lover!",

It has comedy, thrill, romance,sadness, flow and not to mention it's a true story of a legend. What else would you ever want from a movie ? It's probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. I love it and will certainly going to watch it again soon. Mahi....??",
