Key takeaways include 1) avoid this film and 2) chariot racing is both incredibly dangerous and woefully unethical.",

I shouldn't have given it a chance.\n\nI could write a book of the reasons this movie is bad. And if I did, it would be titled \"Ben-Hur\" because this movie has little in common with the book other than names and a general outline. A very general outline. My biggest problem is this movies overall lack of care for any historical accuracy beyond costumes. They portrayed the Romans fighting man on man, rather than in the lines/formations that made them such deadly opponents. They had Ben-Hur, a Jew, break the 3rd commandant multiple times. They had Jesus growing up in Jerusalem. Apparently they missed that he was often called \"Jesus of Nazareth\". Also the haircuts were all wrong. Jewish men did not have long hair. I know all those paintings of Jesus portray him as a European with long hair, but that's thanks to one of the Popes, don't remember which one.\n\nMoving on, they messed up the timeline, changing when Messala went to Rome and everything else. For no apparent reason, they have Pontius Pilot ride through Jerusalem at the beginning instead of Valarius Gratius. And then they switch out accidentally dropping roof tiles for someone shooting at him. Why? The people who made this movie seem to have operated by the mantra \"If it works, change it.\"\n\nThat also applies to specific story points. All of the ones that I thought were the best have been either changed or removed entirely. Want a specific one? You know that Roman who's life Ben-Hur saved that then adopted him giving him Roman citizenship which is a vital point for the rest of the story? Let's replace him with Morgan Freeman finding Ben-Hur washed up on the beach after a shipwreck. This does, of course, add several plot holes, but who cares? Not the people who made this film. It's almost as if rather than reading the book, they had an intern watch the silent film then give a brief summary of the events that they then worked from.\n\nTL:DR, if you like the book or either of the other live action Ben-Hur films, you won't like this movie. If you don't care about them or historical accuracy, you might like it.",

It did not deserve the negative response and box office heartbreak. The story was well told, and well acted, with convincing characters, and plenty of excitement along the way. My only complaints would be that it did lack a little character development with the female roles and it could have easily been 20 minutes longer. There were also a few weak moments in the script.

The plot was a little condensed, as I could clearly tell this story was meant for either a book or a 3 hour plus movie, so the story kinda jumbles around a lot. However, there were some scenes in this movie that absolutely caught my attention, the slave scenes on the boat were beautifully done, and invigorating to watch. I will admit the ending was a little hurried, and just ended pretty oddly and abruptly, but still, the scenes that were enjoyable were enough to make sure that ending didn't ruin the movie for me as much as it could have. Jack Huston (Judah Ben-Hur) was great in this movie, he had to act out a variety of different circumstances, unlike some of the other characters who had a pretty blunt and flat personality, whereas this character was allowed to change drastically throughout the movie, and Huston executed that really well. Are there some scenes that this movie rushes through? Sure. This movie might have a few parts that might leave the audience confused, but the overall story, and the way that story was executed in this movie was done quite to my amusement, so I have no choice but to go against the grain and say that \"Ben-Hur\" is definitely worth the watch.",

Gone is the charisma of Charlton Heston's portrayal of Ben Hur, replaced with a ghost whisperer of a performance by Jack Huston.  Many of the plot lines in the original were flat out ignored.  Why, when an escaped galley slave, returns to Jerusalem without any standing what-so-ever, is he not immediately arrested and put to death?  None of the plot lines in this remake make any sense.

            "content": "This past week has been a double dose of 'reimagined' classic films, specifically, 'The Magnificent Seven' and 'Ben-Hur.' In my recent review of the western, I had to admit that there was a valid reason for revisiting the themes and sufficient amount of entertainment value to stand on its own. Unfortunately, the epic tale of ancient Rome did not survive the process intact. One of the few valid reasons for remaking such an iconic movie is that it contains such universal themes as to reveal a fundamental truth of the human condition. Movies such as this deserve to be remade every generation or so, filtered through their experiences and values. While such themes are present in 'Ben-Hur,' this incarnation of the story was unable to do them justice properly. The filmmaker, Timur Bekmambetov, has only been active as a director's 2000. Among his most notable movies today include the exceptionally bizarre 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,' the physics pending action movie, 'Wanted' and arguably his best films, 'Day Watch/ Night Watch.' The failure of this film to succeed should not fully reflect on the talents of this man. Few filmmakers can even approach the mastery of the 1959 iconic movie of the same name, William Wyler. Also, the cast of that film included an all-star cast including such legendary performers as Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd. Finally, such an epic story required almost 4 hours to relate to the audience. This recent movie reduces the time by nearly half of the running late just over two hours. Much has to be sacrificed while cutting a film by the running the length of an entire movie. Sacrifice for expediency was character development in the pool estimation of the main themes. The source material adapted from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ'is intact with a few notable exclusions.Although Jesus Christ is featured in the appropriate moments, the impact was made so inconsequential allowing it to be removed completely for distribution in several countries.\n\nThe opening of the movie bypasses any attempt at character introduction or setting up the story. That goes directly into the most famous scene of the 1959 movie, the chariot race at the Circus Maximus. True, is only a brief glimpse were shattering the upcoming 10-minute segment of the story, but it did come across as a contrivance whose only purpose to tease the audience and hopefully take their mind off the aspects lacking in the movie. The scene segues from Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) in an intense horse race with his adopted Roman brother, Messala Severus (Toby Kebbell). Judah is drawn from his horse and severely injured, but Messala carries his injured friend back home. There he can be nursed back to health by his mother Naomi (Ayelet Zurer) and his younger sister Tirzah (Ayelet Zurer). There is a budding romance between Messala and Tirzah by the union between a Roman citizen, and a Jew was tightly regulated. Despite being created as part of the family, Messala Pierce disconnected from his Roman heritage. To establish his growth and reputation, he joins the Roman legion currently fighting a campaign in Germany.\n\nThree years go by, and Messala has become a highly respected officer in the Roman army. During that time Judah has become drawn to the young Jewish woman Esther (Nazanin Boniadi). Since Judah is a prince among his people and Esther comes from a much lower status relationship is not possible. The situations are preventing happiness for both Judah and Messala demonstrating in microcosm the bitter hatred between Romans and Jews, helping establish how dangerous it was that Judah provided shelter and medical care to a young Zealot youth named Dismas (Moisés Arias). The dire circumstances of exacerbated Esther's father, Simonides (Haluk Bilginer), arrange for a Roman marriage officer with political influence.\n\nThe pivotal dramatic moment occurs when new Roman governor Pontius Pilate (Pilou Asbæk) enters Jerusalem to take up residence. During his procession into the city, people take to the streets and rooftops to watch. Judah and his family are watching from the roof as Dismas attempts to assassinate the governor with the bow and arrow. Differing significantly from how this moment was played out in 1959. Then it was an accident with Judy's mother, and sister is launching a piece of masonry that crashed into the ground barely missing the government. Here it is a deliberate act of sedition through the highlighting the rebellious attitude developing among the Jewish population. Centurions are dispatched to break into the home in search of a would-be assassin. To protect his family and rather than betraying a fellow Jew, Judah confesses to the crime. He is immediately arrested and taken away sentenced to prolonged suffering and certain death as a slave on a Roman galley. As he is bound and taken away, he stumbles and exhausted request a drink of water. The soldier forbids it but a carpenter, Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro). The soldier tries to prevent it as a single serene glance from Jesus he backs down.\n\nJudah is placed under the command of Quintus Arius (James Cosmo) and a Roman galley. For five years his life consists of being chained to a bench pulling an oar to the time of a beating drum. The relationship between Judah and the officer is completely omitted to remove the portion of the story that has an adopted and brought back to Rome. Instead, it a naval battle to destroy the ship but in this telling, only Judah manages to survive. He washes up on shore and found by Sheik Ilderim (Morgan Freeman). The Sheik is about to turn him into the Romans to retain his status, and property Judah notices that one of his prize white stallions is sick. He tells his new that he knows how to treat the horse and strikes a bargain or his freedom. The horses cured, and eventually Judah becomes part of the Sheik's company. The base Sheik earned a lucrative living by betting on chariot races entering his team. When the regular driver is injured in Judah demonstrates great ability as a driver Ilderim allows him to drive for him. They are about to return to Rome to enter an international race at the Circus Maximus. Judah discovers that Messala was going to race on behalf of the Romans he has a chance for revenge. His former adoptive brother had an opportunity to help after the assassination attempt but did nothing. As a result, the new Governor orders the arrest of Judah's mother and sister but due to their social status avoided an immediate death sentence commuted to banishment to a leper colony. Judah plans the kill Messala and receives the wise counsel of the Sheik and how to do it during the race since there is no law applicable in the Circus. The actual racing sequence is admittedly exciting although forgoing the blades on the bureaus of a rival chariot. The main difference in this interpretation is that the Sheik is moving around the track shouting helpful instructions to Judah. There is another scene with Jesus that mirrors his interaction with Judah. As Jesus was being led off to his death, he stumbles, and Judah steps forward to give him water. As he dies the skies darkened as a turd of rain falls on the land. It immediately cures everyone in the leper colony including Judah's mother and sister.\n\nThis film follows on the heels of another biblical epic, 'Noah.' Because of the religious controversy surrounding this movie and its interpretation of the Scriptures the producers of this movie were exceptionally cautious and held the religious scenes were presented. As noted they were also quick to entirely remove them in markets where Judeo-Christian scenes might be construed as offensive. Considering the subtitle of the novel was 'A Tale of the Christ,' it is disconcerting that all references to Jesus will reduce to a nearly inconsequential thread in the story. The entire story lacks the depth of character development and gravitas suitable for an epic. It comes across as an awkwardly paste action movie punctuated by the scenes of the naval battle in the chariot race. I doubt that any cinephile will discuss this film 2075, the 59 years that the previous version has endured thus far.",

            "content": "Originally published at: http://thepeoplesmovies.com/2016/09/film-review-2-ben-hur-2016/\n\nThe posters for Monty Python's Holy Grail jokingly suggested that, such was the inadequate scale, ambition and quality of the picture, it \"made Ben-Hur look like an epic\". Well, funnily enough, some forty years later, another Ben-Hur film has come along that has done the same, and much more, for even the most wearisome and threadbare movie. Timur Bekmambetov's adaptation of Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (now the third screen version) is so dreary and inconsequential it seems to take the form of some masochistic piece of self-endurance. It is such a complete and utter non-event you wonder what possessed the suits at Paramount and MGM to plough $100 million into this massive wet fart of a film. It's possibly also another cautionary tale in the mould of John Carter. Fail to find an A-lister on which to float your bloated popcorn picture and you'll almost certainly fail to find an audience to hoover it up.\n\nTreading much the same ground as the previous versions, Ben-Hur recounts the story of Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston), a prominent and wealthy Jew living in Jerusalem with his adopted Roman brother Messala (Toby Kebbell). Messala, being of Roman rather than Jewish stock, considers himself an outsider and enlists in the Roman army, returning years later as a decorated and successful soldier. Messala has been entrusted with policing Jerusalem, a city brimming with tension stoked up by Zealots, for the entrance of new governor Pontius Pilate. Trouble inevitably starts with Ben-Hur taking the blame for an attempted assassination. With Messala still feeling slighted at a perceived non-integration into his Jewish family, he has Ben-Hur expelled and sold into slavery, prompting a torturous and leaden voyage of personal redemption as Ben-Hur attempts to win his freedom and a chance of revenge against his brother.\n\nUpon entering Ben-Hur you find yourself asking the question: Why? Upon exiting the cinema, you find yourself asking it again. In an age of comic book cinematic universes, why attempt to revive the sword and sandals epic with such a lumpen bore as this? Script-wise it's a forgettable parade of triumph over adversary and brotherly love turned sour clichés with Huston gurning his way through the picture and Kebbell looking like he regrets his decision to sign on.\n\nSomewhere along the line the decision was made to compound an already baffling list of follies by releasing this thing in 3D. Really, it's a wonder that anybody is still peddling it. Consequently one doesn't even have the meagre luxury of falling back on visuals to sustain one's interest. It's such a drab and grey affair, shot almost entirely in close-up, that at times you suspect you must have smeared Vaseline over your own eyes before entering the cinema. Which probably would have been a good idea.",

The cinematography is okay just a lot of shaking cam and choreography is is decent for that it is. The score is fine.

It was a let down without any notable performances. Besides, the idea of upgrading the story was good, though not everyone going to like that. Particularly the one who loved the old film or the versions.\n\nThe length is justified. For the kind of story the film narrates, the pace was very good. So for me this is not a bad flick, but just some key features missing like I said the star value. For the first timers, like today's generation, this film might work, but for the others most probably not. And the end was disappointing, because it felt like watching a Disney film that made for children and families.\n\nI think the director of 'Wanted' did his job as it required. Definitely not an unnecessary remake, but should have been careful in the historic events. Overall, it fell short of depth. You won't feel emotions and/or the character's struggle. In the end it became just an entertainment product and if you expect beyond that, you are only responsible for that. So good luck with the watch if you are yet to give it a try.\n\n5/10",

Naturally the chariot race is, once again, the scene to see and which everybody waits for, especially as the visual effects in this version showing the circus (the race arena) and the people are absolutely flawless and look so real it might pass for a actual shooting in 33A.D. (if they just had had the cameras back then). One drawback for me, just as in Lucy, I'm a bit tired of seeing Morgan Freeman always occupying the same kind of role, playing the wise old man, no matter what place, time or story of the movie. There are more actors alive to fill that spot, I'd say. Altogether it's a movie that is o.k., no more, no less, and it's not a must see.",

This thing takes quite a while to get going, and I remember sitting there thinking, for what reason is all of this going on?  Once it gets going, this version of Ben-Hur has some good things.  In pretty typical Hollywood remake fashion it does rely heavily on CGI to move the story along, but that's a normal thing these days.  I did like the ending and the transformation that takes place with the story of Jesus playing a part on their lives.  Not great, not horrible so it is a rental for most I would say.",

In all his movies, it seems he's always the same character.  The Ben Hur remake just has a much stronger emotional impact (had me in tears) and never shied away from the brutal truth; Jesus bled, felt unimaginable pain and suffering and people can be sadistic monsters even when they think they are being noble patriots. \n\nYes, I give this movie 5 stars !",

            "content": "Oh this is gonna be fun, fuck being professional. Ok, calm down Stephen... Before the onslaught begins i have to commend this film for doing one thing that i didn't think it was possible for it to do; making a 2 hour film feel a fuckload longer than its almost 4 hour predecessor. Checking the time half way through the film i was sure it had been 1 hour and 40 minutes at least.... not even 1 hour had passed and i strongly contemplated just walking out. But putting all that aside how about we show this undeserving shit some mercy. \n\nSo 'Ben-Hur' is based off the novel by Lew Wallace and is a remake of the 1959 masterpiece of the same name. The film stars Jack Huston as Judah Ben-Hur, Toby Kebbell as Messala, and Morgan Freeman in a stupid-ass wig. Now without a doubt this film is going to be compared to the 1959 version, it's inevitable, but to be honest even with the classic out of the picture there is still not a single redeeming quality in this entire film. The action is lacklustre, the overuse of CGI is distracting, the way it was filmed was putrid, the story is a mess, characters and their motivations are unbelievably stupid, and they completely butchered the crucial religious elements of the film. Literally nothing in this film worked, like at all, it was a complete bore from start to finish and was one of the worst cinema experiences of the year. \n\nI went into this film knowing without a doubt that there was nothing it could do to surpass or even come close to the 1959 version.... except utilise modern technology to enhance some battle sequences. But by some miracle they managed to fuck up the most simple of tasks. Watching 10 model ships floating in a pool was more exciting than what they conjured up in this disaster. But the reality is, in scenes such as the ship battle, and the chariot race, it isn't the big OMG moments and flashy CGI that make them entertaining, you need to care about the characters and more importantly feel like you can get behind Ben-Hur. But i honestly didn't give two shits about any characters and was not able to root for Ben-Hur at all during the film. They tried too hard to make him seem like the kind, caring figure he is supposed to be and at times just came across as a dick. I really don't want to spoil story details so i will save them for another review, but the character decisions and the motivations behind those decisions in this film are just fucking stupid. Some of these decisions are the same or similar in the 1959 version but because of other relationships they altered in this film it completely fucked up any chance certain scenarios had of being believable. \n\nNow the story in this film is another aspect that was a fucken snooze-fest. Majority of it was due to the fact that no single character was interesting but also because so many moments were either severely rushed or moved incredibly slow, there was no consistency to the pace. Now being a 2 hour film there was a lot they needed to cut out of the story understandably, but literally almost 2 hours of crucial story was thrown out and it hurt the film a lot. This led to a lot of inconsistencies in the plot that were more frustrating than anything. And don't even get me started on how they completely fucked up the religious elements of the film, something that was so important and powerful to the story. They should have gotten rid of it if they weren't going to treat it seriously, such a waste. \n\nSo in the end, this film is like a gift you open that you know will be shit but you aren't prepared for what awaits inside...... literally a pile of shit. Seriously though, watch the 1959 version of Ben-Hur, save yourself the pain and torture of having to sit through this disaster and watch a masterpiece instead. There's a simple valid reason for why this film lost the studio $120M..... Because it's shit.\n\n1/10",

            "content": "Okay, so how does one take a classic film that got nominated for 16 academy awards, winning 11, including best director, best actor and best cinematography; the only film to win 11 oscars all the way until Titanic and then Lord Of The Rings: The Return of the King. The precious film is an epic three and a half hours long and lacked the special effects capabilities of today? How does one approach a studio and say, we want to remake Ben-Hur? \n\nJoint venture Paramount and MGM thought it would be best to place a fairly unknown director, Timur Bekmambetov at the helm, who's probably best known for his Day Watch and Night Watch. And to only use Morgan Freeman as your A-list actor, no offence to Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell, (who happens to be one of my favourite actors) but they're not of the Charlton Heston status. It's a bold move on all counts but then is it a remake? Or just a different adaptation all together? Either way, it's going to be compared to the sensational '59 version. \n\nFor those not familiar with either the 1959 epic or the novel it's based on, it's possibly the most famous Christian story outside the bible ever written. Written by Lew Wallace and published in 1880, it's the first work of fiction to be blessed by the Pope, in this case Pope Leo XIII. It spurred it's first feature length adaptation, Ben-Hur: A Tale of The Christ back in 1925, which was a silent movie. \n\nThe story follows Juda Ben-Hur, (Jack Huston) a Jewish prince who grows up with his adopted Roman brother Messala (Toby Kebbell.) They're both very competitive with each other and have different ideals but they share the brotherly love and respect for one another. Messala enlists into the Roman army to travel and returns to Jerusalem many years later a true, glorified soldier of Rome. Things become complicated with the occupation/oppression of Rome in Jerusalem, zealots attacking the Romans giving a rather vicious Pilate (Pilou Asbæk) good reason to execute everyone who disobeys or insults them. The brothers are pitted against one another with Ben-Hur accused of treason and banished to become a slave only to return to avenge his family's house. \n\nMorgan Freeman does what he does best and takes the role of the sheik, but this time as an African chariot racer. Now, the chariot race scene was epic in the previous film that included 15,000 extras, 18 chariots and spanned between five to ten weeks of filming and editing. A lot of stunts involved and actually resulted in Stephen Boyd (Messala) gaining skin burns and scars from being dragged around the arena by horse. This version is nicely done but isn't anywhere near the '59 footage; I don't think it even tops Ridley Scott's Gladiator. The CGI is unfortunately weak in small parts but overall, it's a good scene, it's certainly not terrible. \n\nSome slight details missing but nothing overly important, the core of the story is very much intact but you can imagine, some 90mins have been lost from the original though it's not a bad thing, it's certainly a modern version of an epic classic, paraphrased nicely for younger audiences. But it's doesn't really hammer home to point, or at least the point Bekmambetov wanted to get across, this one being more about forgiveness as oppose to '59 being more about revenge. Vengefulness is very much part of the formula but the balance sways to forgiveness, especially with the scenes with Jesus. Unfortunately it lacks the emotional investment and I think it's due to missing dramatics or character development. I didn't seem to feel anything for any of the characters, apart from Jesus, played superbly by 300's God-King, Rodrigo Santoro. Jesus actually has some familiar and powerful lines this time round unlike the silent 59' version. \n\nWhat did annoy me was the shaky-cam style, which seems really noticeable during the beginning of the film. Not sure if it was suppose to add realism to the scenes but it was disorienting and by the end, felt inconsistent. The battle ship scene was impressive but also felt separate from the rest of the movie in terms of style. \n\nMarco Beltrami's score was good, very fitting for the film but only good, like the rest of the movie, just above average kinda good. Has that epic, triumph sound but the sometimes-out-of-key chimes reminded me a lot of Geinoh Yamashirogumi's work on Akira. \n\nIt's not the '59 epic but it's a good attempt, performances were strong but not enough. Not sure if having a-list actors would have made a difference, not even sure if it's made names of both Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell which is a shame of it doesn't and part of me thinks it's deliberate casting. Still a worthy watch and you can see where the 3D element would work. If you haven't seen the '59 this might be a fresh and enjoyable enough, I just feel it didn't quite cross the finish line, or deliver the message it was trying so hard to get across. \n\nRunning Time: 7\nThe Cast: 6\nPerformance: 7\nDirection: 7\nStory: 8\nScript: 7\nCreativity: 7\nSoundtrack: 7\nJob Description: 5\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 0\n\n61% 6/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

The film tries wowing the audience with scenery and copious amounts of cgi. It takes and assumes that the audience can't or doesn't want to tackle the hard questions or topics of the original and instead decided to beat you over the head with a plethora of empty and hollow words and scenes. \n\nThe one exception to this was the crucififiction of Jesus . The scene was shot beautifully and held such power with unexplained emotion pouring from every crevice. For mere moments the breadth and reach of the film neared its predecessor.  This scene ,  the one of few that proved to be a good use of the $100M budget, is an example of the potential the film once had and that has long been lost.\n\nThe acting was par for the course -- not bad but certainly not anything your at hasn't been seen before. The actors, however, weren't helped by a porous script that worked as a leech, effectively sucking any remnants of life that might creep through. \n\nI took no exception to the liberties the filmmakers took with the actual plot. For example , turning Mesalla from mere friend to adopted brother. Nor did I mind that the plot went from Tirzah displacing a shingle that hurt the governor to a full out attempt on the life of Pontius Pilot by a zealot housed with the Hurs. Or removal of the centurion who adopted Judah after his time as a slave by filling that role with more of the shiek (more Morgan Freeman can't be a bad thing can it ?)\n\nHowever , what I do take exception to is the revisions and liberties taken with the ending. It's simply too happy. All of us characters make up , are happy and content. It's as if the film leaves it's characters where they started. There's no growth , no learning, no loss,  and only a facade of pain and remorse. The original comes full circle and it is so extremely gratifying and rewarding -- again something that the new film lacks. This fact and sequence of events merely adds to the feeling that the film is just... Empty. Pointless even. \n\nThe characters may  have ridden off into the sunset feeling joy and bliss but make no mistake -- audiences are leaving neither joyful or blissful.",

            "content": "Ben-Hur epitomizes the ill-advised remake that no wanted to see and no wanted to make.  It was, truth be told, a film that I looked forward to eviscerating --  an example of Hollywood gone wrong with big budget filmmaking, relying more upon name recognition than actual content or inspiration.  And I was completely wrong, as Ben-Hur proves a more solid retelling than anyone anticipated or even deserved.  It is spectacular or even great?  No.  Ben-Hur 2016 wanders into generic modern remake territory occasionally, but what it does it does well.  In fact, it sports advantages over its predecessors whether it's the 1886 novel by Lew Wallace, the original 1925 silent film, or the classic and beloved 1959 movie directed by William Wyler.  (I am familiar with all of these by the way.)  The narrative framework revolves almost entirely upon the friendship and rivalry between Judah Ben-Hur and Messala.  In fact, where in previous versions Messala turns into a cartoonish villain as the story progresses, here he remains sympathetic throughout and shares near equal screen time with the protagonist.  Furthermore, whereas the galley/naval battle scene was done better in 1959, this version's chariot race may actually end up being my favorite for being incredibly brutal and raising the stakes even higher for its protagonist. Though, I absolutely love how this movie essentially slaps both Ben-Hur and Messala for pursuing a path of egotistical vengeance hung up in macho pride.  Lastly, the heavy-handed religious parable that defined the final act of the 1959 version has been toned down in favor of a condensed version that emphasizes the passion story more in terms of personal redemption for our two main leads than the usual religious messaging.  \n\nNow to where it falls short.  William Wyler's 1959 classic sported one of the greatest musical scores of all time.  Put it this way - no one is winning an Oscar for best original score here.  As said before, much of the film can fall into generic blandness as times, but more troubling is the fact that so much effort goes into the primary relationship of the film, that no other relationship or performance stands out.  It also lacks the grandeur of its immediate predecessor, but I suspect that may be intentional, as this is supposed to be a more realistic and grounded approach to the same story we all know.  The artistic feat of not showing Christ's face is gone now, with the usual Jesus cameos to keep Ben-Hur hydrated and honest.  Oh and Morgan Freeman is so out of place in this movie.  He gives it his all, but his dreadlocks prove distracting and his modern affectations are jarring.  So is it worth your time?  To many this may appear to be attempt to cash in on the faith-based film craze that has happened in recent years and may turn off potential audiences.  This is not really the case, and while religious viewers are not turned away, this is more for general audiences.  It obviously doesn't compare in quality to what came before, but it does have enough merit to stand on its own and is worth a screening.  In fact I view it as an interesting alternate universe take, considering the GIGANTIC twist it plays in the third act.  It's a shame that it was saddled with an obnoxious budget and unrealistic expectations.  It may prove to be successful overseas and become a cult hit - the John Carter of 2016 if you will.  But that's just speculation.  So yes give Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Two Brothers a shot.  It needs the chance.",

However, as a Christian, I'm often disappointed.  \n\nWhile the Charlton Heston adaptation earned 11 Academy Awards, this 6th version will be mostly forgotten.   Watch the original instead.\n\nUplifting theme: \nRedemption.\nRevenge vs. forgiveness\nMercy vs. justice\n\nThings I liked:\nThis was filmed at the same site in Rome as the 1959 movie.\nSome of the sets were actually very good.\nThe Roman ship battle scene was very impressive.  You'll want to take a deep breath when it's over.\nThe chariot race towards the end was brutal, action-packed, and pretty exciting.\nCheers to married couple Roma Downey and Mark Burnett who keep trying to bring family-friendly, inspiring movies to Christian audiences.  In fact, this adaptation shows more scenes with Jesus than any other version of Ben-Hur.\nJack Huston sells us on his character's development.\n\nThings I didn't like:\nIt doesn't seem to have the same heart and soul as the Charlton Heston version. \nThe first half of the movie was a bit of a snore fest.\nChoppy editing.\nThere is a lot of very obvious foreshadowing.\nThis remake doesn't really add anything new or even offer a different perspective to give audiences a reason to watch it.\nA lot of CGI, although it was done well.\nI always feel so sad for the horses in these sandal and sword movies.\nI wanted to cry and really feel something, but the few touching scenes were too rushed.\nYeow!  Yeow!  Yeow!  Yeow!  (chariot race)\nThis remake is half the length of Charlton Heston's famous film that lasted almost four hours.  Granted, four hours is really too long for a movie (the popcorn only lasts 20 minutes).  I guess you could call this version \"efficient.\"  \nThis movie will give you a headache if you see it in 3D.  2D is perfectly fine and enough.\nWhen you see Morgan Freeman playing the old sage, you know this movie isn't going to be offering anything new.  I mean, how many times have we seen him play that role already?  Don't get me wrong.  I do love him.  But wait, Morgan Freeman in dreadlocks?  That's new.\n \n\n\nInteresting lines:\n\"What should I do?\" - Judah Ben-Hur  (Jack Huston)\n\"You've done enough.  Now pray!\" - Naomi (Ayelet Zurer)\n\"Love your enemies.\" - Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro)\n\"That's progressive.\" - Judah\n\"It's the truth.\" - Jesus\n\"We don't kill all Romans.\" - girl in tent\n\"Well, that's not very comforting to the dead ones.\" - Judah\n\"You confuse peace with freedom.\" - man in tent\n\"You should have stayed away.\" - Messala (Toby Kebbell)\n\"You should have killed me.\" - Judah Ben-Hur  (Jack Huston)\n\"I will.\" - Messala\n  \n\nTips for parents:   \n\nFighting, blood, suffering, drowning, trampling.  In other words, LOTS of violent sequences.\nSome kids just don't like older movies, so this newest version of Ben-Hur will be a nice introduction to this loosely-based Bible story for them.",

Well, that is simply untrue and the message that is conveyed at the end of this film manages to make up for many of its own shortcomings, in comparison to the 1959 classic. Huston does manage to do a fine job in the lead role, and with a running time that is slightly more than half of the previous big-screen version, those looking for a fluid representation that contains both an action-packed narrative and/or elements of spiritual redemption shouldn't be disappointed either way. It's obvious that the next step for me is to finally view the 1925 version so my comparisons of General Lew Wallace's timeless \"Tale of the Christ\" can come full circle, much like the breathtaking chariot races that I've had the pleasure to witness in both the Wyler version and Timur Bekmambetov's reverent update.",

They're not all a waste of time (think The Departed or Let Me In), but it's vapid movies like this that ensure their bad name stays in tact. Lets start with the positives though. With Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Day Watch, Wanted) behind the camera stylish action sequences are all but guaranteed, and an incredible battle at sea witnessed from below the decks undeniably delivers on this front. He's also lucky his two leading men, Jack Huston as the eponymous persecuted Jew and Toby Kebbell as his vengeful Roman (adopted) brother, are both extremely strong actors who manage to turn even the worst dialogue into semi-watchable melodrama. That's where the praise stops unfortunately, for the rest of the film shouts disaster. The most notable flaw is the casting of Morgan \"paycheque\" Freeman, who plummets to new depths of awfulness thanks to his phoned-in performance, a lazy and clichéd narration, and a wig that'll enter the hairpiece hall of shame alongside Travolta's hairdo from Battlefield Earth. There are also a plethora of bizarre choices made by the filmmakers, including an embarrassingly out-of-place epilogue featuring Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro) that should've been either fleshed out more throughout the runtime or cut away entirely. As is increasingly common in modern blockbusters there's also a heavy use of CGI - which in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing - except here it is woefully underdone and sticks out like a sore thumb, especially in the numerous wide shots attempting to establish scale and grandeur. Perhaps most disappointing is the underwhelming chariot-race finale that, for all its handheld camerawork and gritty intentions, is stunted by messy editing, weirdly absent violence and poor choreography that fails to hide the dumb conveniences within the race. Capped off with an atrocious song played over the final moments, Ben-Hur 2.0 is a bland and misjudged rehash of a swords-and-sandals classic.",

While of course it nowhere near the epic Chartlon Heston blockbuster the film holds its own in grand production design and skillful direction by Timu Bekmambetov and an able script by Keith R. Clarke and John Ridley based on Lew Wallace's novel, blending well-wrought CGI and set pieces including the infamous chariot race/grudge match with just enough violence and steadfast resolve.

            "content": "Rarely are classics improved upon with remakes, others tend to tarnish the original versions.  This iteration of Ben-Hur tends to fall somewhere in between those two extremes.\n\nThere was no need to remake Ben-Hur to begin with.  I'm not even sure why they had to do an animated version in the early 2000's and bring back Heston.  The 1959 tale is a classic and the chariot race will never be touched.  It did so much for filmmaking at that time and attempting to top it in any way shape or form, is a huge mistake.  While I don't think they tarnished the legacy of the original, it also didn't fix some easy mistakes that the 1959 film made.\n\nThe crux of the story in both cases is the troubled relationship between Judah Ben-Hur and Messala Severus, this time played by Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell respectively.  With that said, in both films they make the same mistake of forcing the Jesus arc into what is already a jam packed film.  I'm not saying I can't appreciate the faith element, I can.  But there are other ways to portray Ben-Hur's struggle to come to grips with his faith and lack there-of.  By forcing the Jesus angle into the film, it becomes painfully uneven.  Either make him a more demanding presence or cut it out completely, make a choice.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of good things about this remake.  Kebbell and Huston actually hold their own as friends (brothers?) turned foes due to political issues.  I really enjoyed watching their relationship unfold into surprising directions.  At the same time, the ending that was chosen for that relationship is absolutely one hundred percent garbage, and unfortunately is the exact direction a clichéd Hollywood film would take them.\n\nMorgan Freeman (with putrid dreadlocks) is also quite good in the film, and not as distracting as the trailers make it seem.  Having just watched the 1959 version recently, I think Freeman is just as good as Hugh Griffith was as Ben-Hur's companion, Ilderim.  \n\nThere are plenty of refreshing choices this film makes in its story structure that are beneficial to the story, and I enjoyed those updated elements.  But it's unfortunate that a sword and sandals epic in 2016 just doesn't hold the same type of gravitas that it did back in the day.  The new chariot race is fine, but I think I still prefer the 1959 take even more.  And as good as I thought Kebbell and Huston were, I can't possibly believe they hold a candle to what Heston and Boyd did.  I didn't hate the update, but man it could have been a whole lot better.\n\n+Kebbell and Huston hold their own\n\n+New updates improve the flow\n\n-But with the Jesus angle, it's still incredibly uneven\n\n-Wretched Hollywood ending\n\n4.7/10",

It is a adaptation of the book.\n\nThe movie begins with the chariot race, before flashing back to 8 years earlier where we See Messala and Ben Hur having their own private race, where they are closer like brothers. The story continues to follow them as they drift apart. Messala tries his best to fit in with Rome and his role as a Roman soldier, and makes the decision to turn against those who had raised him and loved him. The pace never drags as we follow Ben-Hur during his time as a galley slave, before escaping, and meeting a nomad (Morgan Freeman's character) where he endears himself to the man and decides to follow the older man's advice of facing Messala in the chariot race. We all know the story.\n\nThe acting is superb. Jack Hutson does a great job as Judah Ben-Hur, bu showcasing how Ben-Hur struggles with his loyalty to Messala, his desire for peace, and his duty to his people. As we travel down the road of Ben-Hur's increasing desire for revenge, you feel as though the actor himself is experiencing the same inner demons ass the character, making Ben-Hur's enlightenment at the end much more powerful when he realizes what his quest for revenge has cost him. Toby Kebbel as Messala does a great job portraying the orphaned Roman, raised by Judeans, who questions and is always uncertain of where he belongs. His descent into further hatred and jealousy of his family is clearly portrayed and believable. The two actors have great chemistry on the screen to where you believe that they were brothers who were close, estranged, and then grow close again.\n\nI loved the ending as Illderim frees Ben-Hur's family from the prison they were in and the scene between Ben-Hur and Messala as he apologizes and says that he will not fight anymore is a powerful one. The ending with them riding off together as brothers again is a great ending and embodies what Christ was trying to tell Ben-Hur earlier in the film. In fact, you see his very message exemplified in the story of Ben-Hur and Messala.\n\nI enjoyed the film and never grew bored. And despite the critics complaint about CGI, there is very little of it and it isn't noticeable like it is in a lot of movies coming out lately. This is the story of Ben-Hur, but still very different from the 1959 version, which bored me to death and overlong in my opinion, but Cecil B. Demil liked his epics. \n\nGive this movie a try. The critics hate it, but can you really be surprised? Critics hate just about everything. The movie is worth seeing. Give it try and judge for yourself. The people trashing are doing it because they are nostalgic about the 1959 version and think that that is the only true version.",

            "content": "Despite some standout set pieces, this unoriginal and uninspiring take on Ben-Hur goes round in circles as if chasing its tail, seemingly remaking the 1959 William Wyler epic rather than adapting Lew Wallace's classic Christian novel in its own voice. When Morgan Freeman gets tapped to provide the by-now-clichéd Wise Man narration as he's done for countless other H'Wood productions, you know that a film isn't exactly striving for creativity. Here, the team that brought the hit cable docudramas The Bible and A.D.: The Bible Continues to the small screen, producers Mark Burnett (CBS's Survivor) and Roma Downey (CBS's Touched by an Angel), buffer up the same safe, cut-and-dry, and speed-resistant sheen that they gave to Son of God, a children's Bible story marketed as an adult drama where Jesus Christ looked and walked like a Tom Ford model. Sure, blood and guts spillage gets teased, but it's all a sleight of hand. Very little of this film feels real, in fact, as so much CGI gets used to finish off shots and render people that the software engineers should be eligible for their S.A.G. and Director's Guild cards. If this techno trickery at least struck a unique chord, some of these transgressions could be forgiven. In a recent article for Variety, the producers even promised that this version will be different from the Oscar-winning classic starring Charlton Heston, but the 2016 re-do definitely plays out like a pale imitation. Even the one improvement on the 1959 version - economy - often acts as a deficit. Sure, the new model clocks in at nearly two hours less than its forebear but at the cost of decent storytelling. Some choppy editing makes for some awkward and abrupt transitions.\n\nIn this PG-13-rated religious drama, a wealthy Jewish merchant and prince (Huston) gets falsely accused of treason by his adopted brother (Kebbell), so he returns to his homeland to seek revenge, but finds redemption instead. \n\nCertainly, the production had potential (not just the faith-based filmgoers who made Miracles from Heaven a hit either). This novel once outsold Gone with the Wind and the producers took great pains to make everything but the running time epic (the budget is reportedly in the neighborhood of $100 million and the cast and crew prove somewhat star-studded in comparison with, say, Son of God). Aside from an exhilarating galleon and chariot battle (again, mirrors to Wyler's classic and augmented by too much CGI) and a game cast, Ben-Hur comes off as redundant and underwhelming a Biblical epic as Noah and Exodus: Gods and Kings-themselves pale imitations. \n\nBottom line: Chariots of Misfire",

            "content": "There have been many a film versions of Lew Wallace's classic epic Ben-Hur, but of course the most notable is William Wyler's 1959 adaptation starring Charlton Heston that garnered eleven Academy Awards. It is a behemoth at three and a half hours and a product of a different time in Hollywood's history. A time when the studio system still reigned and historical/biblical epics were as hot as comic book movies are today. It was the success of Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments that also starred Heston that spurred MGM to invest $15 million (the most expensive film ever made at that point in time) in a new version of Ben-Hur. So, the question is: why re-make such a larger than life classic? Why even attempt to overcome the aura that surrounds a staple of popular culture as definitive as Wyler's Ben-Hur? While I questioned the reasoning for such a re-make it was easier to understand why an updated version of this story was necessary. The 1959 version is very much a product of its time and one that, through rose tinted glasses, can only be seen as this great epic that nothing and no one can touch or challenge. It has gorgeous practical sets and thousands upon thousands of extras shot on panorama that gives it the impression of being that much larger in its scope. It is also a movie someone of not only my generation, but those likely born in the decade prior to me and certainly those born after me, can't see without the already its status as one of the biggest, best movies ever made. Heston is this mythical type-figure of the golden age of Hollywood that can never be touched and so to even try and match such larger than life precedents would be an immediate way to automatically disqualify one's self from even being considered a valid piece of filmmaking. Still, with the 1959 version being as intimidating as it is an updated, shorter, and more current telling of the story might allow a way for modern audiences to find a way into the older version that they'd heard so much about though likely felt they'd already seen due simply to the lasting impression it's left. From the get-go director Timur Bekmambetov's (Wanted, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter) new version felt like it was going to be little more than a cheap knock-off (despite that $100 million production budget). Fortunately, while this 2016 take on Wallace's story is certainly the cliff notes version when compared to Wyler's it is surprisingly effective in accomplishing what it sets out to do and even has enough gumption to emphasize certain themes and actually develop characters rather than simply summarizing the previous versions with contemporary editing practices.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

As redlettermedia.com said  \n\"They could have made 100 films for a million each and made a ton of money.\" \n                And in the process we may have gotten some fresh, original  and who knows maybe thought provoking entertainment.  But no , executives who lean on market analysis thought THIS was a better idea.   \n So with this bomb another nail goes into the coffin of the corporate Hollywood movie machine.  The last time Hollywood began to implode was when the old movie moguls lost touch with audiences.  It gave rise to Scorsese,  Altman, Coppola,  Spielberg,  etc. Let's hope we are at another moment when the walls will crumble and young creative film makers will be able to over run the VERY non creative often moronic Hollywood executives who keep delivering remakes , reboots,  sequels and bloated budget trash.",

I saw Ben Hur and loved it.  I went with my sister and we were awed what a good movie.  Because I believe Angelica Huston is one of the worst actresses ever on the screen did not expect her nephew to be any better, but he was great.  This movie is exciting, violent, acting is terrific and the chariot race makes the original look like kindergartners playing Red Rover.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good movie.",

So I am not surprised this did not match the grandeur and scale of the 1959 Ben Hur.\n\nOverall this was an OK film but something was amiss.  It felt rushed and I am not sure I would have caught on to the story and plot if I was not already familiar with this story.  For a first time viewer of this story it would be hard to follow the narrative.  \n\nThe sea battle scene as viewed from Benhur's POV may have seemed like a great idea but that view takes away the overall context of what is happening and why.  Just like Benhur & the galley slaves are totally in the dark of the ships, fight and action around them and see only the tension within the confines of their galley it leaves the audience as much in the dark with very little context on what is actually happening.\n\nThe Chariot race was full of action but again something was missing.  I am not even sure what exactly happened that caused some of the accidents that took out the riders.  And I defintely did not understand what happened to Mesala.  I just know that in the confusion at some point in the race he was out - how and why, I have no clue.  And I am pretty certain I did not miss a single frame of the action.  Perhaps it all happened too fast for my slow brain to latch on to the narrative.\n\nAlso several scenes with their rapid camera movement made it hard to see and focus giving me a mild headache.  And I was sitting on the last row in the cinema hall but still felt dizzy with the fast movement & constant swaying of several scenes.\n\nI am not in the film-making business or a film student so cannot explain many things in technical terms.  But as a layman there was something lacking in this movie.  I have watched the 1959 version several times and will probably see it many more times in future as I like that film and own the blu-ray.  I can't say the same thing about this 2016 version - it was ok and perhaps I will rent it when it comes on DVD but unlike the 1959 version I don't think this is a film you would like to own and watch again and again.\n\nAnd finally, what was that music at the end when the credits were rolling?  It did not even feel like it belonged to the same movie or period in History.",

There are small departures from the novel, and necessary omissions due to the length and complexity of he novel, but the essence of the story still shines brightly. I'm not sure why the entertainment rags all raced to denounce the box office numbers after Friday night, not giving movie goers the opportunity to see the movie for themselves over the weekend, but there is a definite prejudice against this movie. The novel, Ben Hur, was the number one best seller in the United States following its publication after the Civil War, and continued as number one until 1937, when Gone with the Wind was published. Many historians and old reviewers of the novel have given credit to this book for having brought healing to the wounds and the deep divide that had stymied the nation following the war between the states. The love, hatred, and finally the redemption of two step-brothers from opposing sides of the religio-political spectrum remains at the heart of the current movie, and resonates deeply in the hearts of anyone who identifies the connection to our very own wounds and divisions as a nation. The story of mercy and forgiveness is not popular among audiences who no longer value the importance of conscience or faith, but those who see passed the biases of reviewers will experience the age old truth that love will cost people everything they have, but nothing could be more valuable or enduring. Ben Hur deals with universal verities that are just as true for ancient Rome and Jerusalem as they are for modern America. People criticize the movie because of the director, because of the use of special effects, because, because, because,... Mostly, however, the modern mind has grown cynical of faith, and hardened against, and uncomfortable with, the subject of sacrificial love.",

That being said, viewers should quit comparing the two! The new Ben Hur as a stand-alone movie is excellent! The movie is gritty with a very realistic look.  Sure there are a lot of things I would change including the ending.  (i.e. The mother and daughter scene getting healed is really lame.) I like all the actors.  The only one, in my mind, that doesn't really fit is Morgan Freeman. He plays his usual reassuring figure that he has played in a dozen other movies.  \n\nAs a summary, it is a very good movie definitely  worth seeing.  The critics, of course, automatically dismiss it because it has a religious element to it.  If they ever begin to realize that faith is an integral part of many people's lives maybe they could provide relevant reviews! Definely go see it!",

The silent with Ramon Novarro from 1925 was wonderful, and I also really enjoyed the 2016 film! Jack Huston carries this film very well--he is a true talent, as all who saw him as Richard Harrow on \"Boardwalk Empire\" will attest. (If you haven't seen him on BE, I urge you to get the DVDs and watch. It's an unforgettable character.) This Ben-Hur is a gritty retelling and I appreciate that. In the course of the film, Judah goes from a privileged prince to a dirty, unshaven and starved slave and it felt authentic. The performance from Huston was thoughtful and nuanced. The scenes with Judah and Messala were terrific, and WOW--the galley scenes from the ship were intense and very well acted and directed. All of the buzz about the chariot racing was true--it was breathtaking and so exciting. Even more so when you realize that these actors really did drive those chariots, and the CGI was limited to parts where humans or animals would have been otherwise injured. The scene where Judah witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus was beyond powerful, and I'm not even a religious person--but the acting was strong and it wasn't overdone. And the scene of forgiveness between the brothers--amazing.\nOn the down side, the presence of Morgan Freeman threw me a bit; it didn't seem like the best casting, because he's just so...Morgan Freeman. (And those dreads were kind of dreadful.) My least favorite part was the music and soft slow motion at the end. I could definitely have done without that. The ending felt very contrived and cheesy, almost made-for-TV-movie-like and (fortunately, I suppose) did not match the strength of the rest of the film. But overall, as I left the theater, I was already planning to see it again, and felt that I'd just watched something pretty darn special.",

            "content": "As a stand-alone film to a non-informed viewer--if they have never seen the 1959 version which won 11 Oscars, headed by the late, great Charlton Heston--this new \"Ben Hur\" would probably be fully satisfying. I would say, almost a B+ or A-. The acting is excellent. The cast is generally fine (though I felt Morgan Freeman gave a fairly flat performance, which felt very much like I was watching an actor playing a role.) But the two leads playing Ben Hur and Marsala were well played. The special effects were great and shows how film has evolved since 1959. Top notch there. This was a big budget film and shows it. Paramount and MGM pulled out all the production stops on this one.\nUnlike 1959, this vs. is not a sideways nod to Jesus behind the scenes as a subtle plot-thread. This is a Jesus film with Ben Hur's story as the connecting thread. Not that that's bad, but it ends up where it felt at times like the Ben Hur story was a device in the Sunday School lesson, rather than the dramatic raw-human impact it had in 1959. Both are Christian films but in this new version, Christ is NOT a subtle thread. How that will work depends on the viewer. There were a few flaws, and the character development in under two hours--compared to what they did with the 1959 version of 3 hrs, 32 minutes, is palpable. (That's why a novice to the film will not know what they're missing.) Gone is the Roman General (Jack Hawkins) whom Heston's Ben Hur saves in the naval battle in 1959 and all of his redemption in Rome. In this version, Ben Hur simply washes up on the shore and begins his new life as a charioteer for Morgan Freeman's travels to race in Jerusalem.\nMy main complaint for marking the film only to B-: The ending felt forced and inconsistent with the reality of that time and place. The goal of the producers, husband wife Christian film makers Mark Burnett & Roma Downey was to make a film about Jesus Christ and \"love conquers all\". So while they left much of the grit and violence in the script, the direction led to a somewhat sappy, Sunday-School morals-tale ending, which seemed manufactured and predictable if you're doing a Church drama in the local theater. I just didn't buy the quick resolutions and tra-la-tra-la rush to put rainbows in a story that is far too earthbound to make that credible. Downey admits this in the interview I'll link to, in which she says that in our world today in 2016, with so much hostility and turmoil they wanted to have a message of forgiveness and love. Yes...but...this is Rome...in 33AD...in an ancient world where things don't always end with nicely tied bows. Where's George R.R. Martin when you need him!? Imagine if at the end of \"Les Miserables\", Inspector Javert found Jesus on that bridge in Paris and walked off, arm in arm with Valjean, who doesn't die, but instead they buy a bed & breakfast together in Maine and live happily ever after. Yes, that would be a sweeter ending. But that's not how Les Miserables is SUPPOSE to end!\nThe 1959 version trusted the viewer to feel the impact of Christ's life in the story. The 2016 version abandoned subtlety and wanted you to not risk figuring it out for yourself. That works--sorta--but the story of Ben Hur ends up a bit the worse in the telling. I'd still see it in the theater for the effects. Not for little kids as it is gritty and violent.",

Contrary to some more avant garde pans if the movie, I was glad that the movie wasn't distracted by some of the unnecessary underlying themes seen in earlier remakes, and instead focused on the core events of the story itself. \n\nSet primarily in ancient Jerusalem, it till seriously the geo-political elements of that time, the struggles between the opposing Jewish sects (Essenes, Hellenistic, Zealots) at that time that were causing splinters in the Jewish community, and intertwined those with the challenges of living in an occupied land. \n\nThese were mixed with very engaging and realistic stories of life, love, and faith that form the subtext or context of life's narrative.  These were placed within the backstory of Christ, both occasional vignettes of him appearing in the movie during his final years as a Jewish carpenter, leading up to his earthly ministry, and ultimately his crucifixion. \n\nAll the while, Ben Hur, the main character, lived his life as a Jew, with the amazing things that happened in his life as a result of his Jewish faith and trying to wrestle with his Jewish identity, his relationships, and his convictions. \n\nUtimately, these led to an unexpected story of the dissatisfaction of revenge, pain, and ultimate redemption. \n\nBen-Hur is a timeless story of redemption and salvation and hope.  It is one that is well-done, with the only critical observation being the sometimes-tight camera shots  occasionally made the viewer want to be reminded of the great scale and scope of the historical canvas of these events, the Roman Empire.  There were some of those that add greatly to the story itself, particularly the scenes of the Roman circus and of the Ionic warship battles (wow). There was ample attention given to those, but more would have added even more to an already very good film. 4.5 stars. Meaningful and enjoyable.",

This 2016 remake will not win any Oscars, but to my own surprise, it wasn't the dud I thought it would be. Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell are fine as the two leads. They didn't really wow me, especially Huston, who pales in comparison to Heston. He was just kind of just there. Nothing spectacular about his performance. Rodrigo Santoro as Jesus was one of the best parts of the movie and gave his small role a lot of meaning. The biggest problem I had with this was the use of handheld cameras and quick cuts, especially during the signature chariot race. It was hard to see what was going on half the time. I was dizzy by the end of it all. A story as grand as Ben-Hur doesn't need to be shot like it is an action movie. The directing and editing really took me out of the movie at times. The movie is actually decent considering what came before it, but unfortunately, it is still titled Ben-Hur. It has to live up to the 1959 classic, which it never comes close to. However, I can't say I completely hated it when all was said and done. But, don't get me wrong, I'll still stick with Heston's version.   \n\nGrade: B-",

            "content": "American Civil War Hero Lewis Wallace - or General Lew Wallace, as he is most often known - published what would become a mega-bestseller, \"Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ,\" in 1880. It told the fictional story of a Jewish prince of Jerusalem, Judah Ben-Hur, in the years of Jesus Christ's preaching, who is betrayed by a childhood friend, Messala, a Roman who sentences him to certain death. Like the hero of another 19th-century epic -  Alexandre Dumas's \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" - he escapes after a long imprisonment, later to return and exact his revenge upon his would-be executioner. Such retribution takes the form of a victory in the chariot races of the Roman circus, during which an accident cripples Messala, who dies thereafter. Where does Christ enter into of all this? At repeated intervals of the novel, Judah crosses paths with the rising prophet, until finally his story and that of the messiah's intersect at the crucifixion of the latter, leading to Judah's conversion to the nascent new religion. Vengeance is not yours to wreak, sayeth the newly resurrected God. And so Judah rises from the ashes of his former life, reunited with his once-lost family, and embraces a hopeful future.\n\nThe first time Wallace's book was brought to the silver screen was in 1907, and then, as ever, the major set piece was that chariot race. When, in 1925, Louis B. Mayer's freshly constituted MGM Studios took on a feature-length version, starring Ramon Novarro as the titular prince, it became, with its $4 million budget,  the most expensive silent film ever made, up to that point. Why? It costs a lot of money to build that circus! But it paid off, saving the studio's fortunes, and the brilliantly realized race sequence was justly celebrated for years to come. Then, in 1959, MGM - again in need of a big hit - took on the epic story once more, now with the great William Wyler (\"The Best Years of Our Lives\") at the helm and the ever-solid Charlton Heston (\"The Ten Commandments\") in the chariot. This time, the circus sequence, alone, cost $4 million. Still, it was all worth it, as the new film went on to win 11 Academy Awards, a record matched only, as of this writing, by \"Titanic\" and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (when epic films win Best Picture, they tend to clean up, since they also win so many of the technical awards, as well). As with the 1925 silent version, what has never failed to impress viewers - even those, like me, who find much of the other parts extremely dated in their aesthetic - since that time is the magnificence of the sets and the masterful mise-en-scène of the chariot race.\n\nAnd now here we are, in 2016, with a brand new retelling of the 136-year-old classic. Religiously minded husband-and-wife producers Mark Burnett and Roma Downey (\"The Bible\" mini-series), working with Russian-Kazakh director Timur Bekmambetov (\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\"), have decided that what the world needs now is another version of Wallace's story. Why not? So much else gets remade. But as with all storytelling, old, new or an amalgam of both, what counts is the central premise - or raison d'être - behind the endeavor. Is there an idea beyond the mercenary? According to Burnett and Downey, there is: to salve the wounds of our hurting world with the balm of healing. Which is why, in this movie, things don't turn out quite the way they did in 1959 and 1925 (I'm purposefully ignoring a 2010 mini-series that is not worth mentioning). There's more forgiveness and more love.\n\nFair enough. Who can argue with that? Unfortunately, there's also less talent. Say what you will about Heston (along with William Shatner, my favorite over-actor), but he held your attention with true magnetism. Director Wyler knew a thing or two about camera placement, and though his Oscar-winning film is riddled with excessive sentiment, it feels brisk, even at over 210 minutes, because we are wholly invested in Ben-Hur's journey. Bekmambetov, who once so wowed me with his early promise in films, made back in Russia, like \"Night Watch\" and \"Day Watch,\" has since those day become mired in the special-effects wizardry of modern-day Hollywood, hopelessly adrift in creative limbo. Lead actors Jack Huston (\"Kill Your Darlings\"), as Ben-Hur, and Toby Kebbell (\"Warcraft\"), as Messala, are appealing in a boyish way, but no match for Heston and his co-star Stephen Boyd (\"Fantastic Voyage\"). This time, the rivals are brothers, and not just friends, a change which actually renders Messala's betrayal a hundred times worse, straining the credibility of the final forgiveness scene. The entire affair is narrated by Morgan Freeman (\"Lucy\") - because who doesn't want to have their film accompanied by his wise, mellifluous voice - who is saddled with so much exposition that we sometimes wonder why we even need the subsequent action. Nevertheless, once the film settles down to its storytelling, there are some sequences that entertain. Of particular note is the scene in the Roman galley, when all hell breaks loose in a naval battle; the chariot race is also fine, though less impressive now in our world of CGI without the sense of it all taking place, for real, in front of the camera. I also enjoyed some of the transitions between scenes, such as when we flash forward 5 years from Ben-Hur's arrival on the ship through the mere flick of a whip. But overall, this is a movie that genuinely begs the question, why bother?\n\nPerhaps the most egregious fault is the choice to show Jesus - remember that this is \"A Tale of the Christ\" - in all his ordinary humanity. For the record, I am an atheist, and so do not believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God. But if you're going to make a film about a deity walking the earth, that deity should have star power. In the 1959 film, we never see Jesus except from behind, and when everyone - from Jews to Romans to slaves - react in awe when gazing upon the man, we supply our own vision of what they see. Here, poor Rodrigo Santoro (\"300: Rise of an Empire\") as Jesus, whose face we see from the get-go,  is burdened with too great of a task, and comes across as just a struggling soul who wishes the world were better. That would be fine - and it's how I envision the historical Jesus, anyway - but when everyone reacts to him as if he commands special power, it makes no sense, because he doesn't. And from the misconception flows all that doesn't work in the rest of the film. If, in the course of my review, I have failed to mention any of the actresses, it's because their parts are as underwritten as they were in 1959, which in 2016 feels unforgivable. Save yourself some money and re-watch the 1959 \"Ben-Hur\" at home on your beautiful widescreen TV. Hokum and all, it'll be more fun.",

Sometimes, inept story-telling leads to nibbling around the edges of a great idea or concept, then filling it in with utter garbage. Let's talk about Ben-Hur (2016)...\n\nI gain no pleasure or pride doing this, but Ben-Hur (2016) is the worst movie I have seen in recent memory.\n\nEvery time I buy a movie ticket with my own money the reason is because I want to see a good movie. In fact, I am more positive with movies than most. I love writing, art, story-telling, and the medium that is film making. My hope is every movie has something great about it, or if we are lucky as movie goers, that every movie is great.\n\nPlot in a paragraph: A young prince Jew, Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) and an orphan Roman Messala Severus (Toby Kebbell) are polar opposites, but growing up together they learn to love each other as brothers. When a rebel attempts to assassinate Pontius Pilate (Pilou Asbaek) Ben-Hur is sentenced to the galleys and his sister and mother are taken to their death. Angry, rage-filled Ben-Hur goes full The Revenant to exact his revenge with the help of Ilderim (Morgan Freeman) in a chariot race in the Roman \"Circus.\" Spoilers, plot twists, bad story-telling devices and we have a movie.\n\nFor starters, this movie taught a Masters Course in how to basterdize a character. Ben-Hur is a non-violent strong willed man with inner strength and faith. His conviction and dedication to those values allow him to go to any lengths to save his family. If there is a chance they are still alive, Ben-Hur will do anything to find out. He moves at the will of his God and is grounded in moral and ethical pride. He is sort of like a Batman-Gandhi hybrid, the original non-violent hero.\n\nDirector Timur Bekmambetov (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter) and screenwriters Keith Clarke (The Way Back) and John Ridley (12 Years a Slave) felt compelled to nod to the original in odd, not memorable ways. They wanted to wink at the original, but without anything iconic from the original.\n\nThis is not about comparing an original (well, a remake have you) to a modernized film. As a standalone movie this film created a hateful, erratically motivated, and poorly fleshed out character in Ben-Hur. He rides a horse once, crashes, and is an expert in all things horses' years later when it is convenient including curing diseases, riding, and racing on a chariot. He is a caring motivator when it suites the scene, then a callous blood thirsty character a few minutes later.\n\nEsther (Nazanin Boniadi) was grounded in faith, serving the people, and acting with non-violence. It was a different choice to swap some of the characteristics of Ben-Hur to his wife and make him more violent, just not a well-executed choice.\n\nIn the 1959 iteration of Ben-Hur the film makers decided to show the character of Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro) in a more reserved manner, making his moments more powerful. This movie he might have the fourth most dialog and screen time of any character. That did not enhance the movie, rather take away time to develop Ben-Hur and Massala as brothers, enemies, and the true power of forgiveness of humanity. \n\nInstead the film makers settled for infomercial-y speeches of exposition by the Jesus character. A little preachy.\n\nSome of the larger issues with the film that were not character based came from the script. Just not a good script at all. The characters spoke in and out of modern day phrases and language that would have been more of the time. Freeman's character, Ilderim, was just Morgan Freeman in a movie. Completely out of place and in a completely separate movie altogether. Sometimes the costumes looked of the time, but most of the time they looked like the hipster section of the Gap. Too clean, shiny, and like what clothes of that time would look like with today's advancements. \n\nAn awful script. Basterdized characters. Poor decision making on the creative license to tell a modernized story. By all accounts this is the worst movie of the year leaving a healthy, comfortable gap between its competitors.\n\nThe chariot race at the end was awesome. Shot very well and easily the most entertaining element of the movie. However the chariot race was ten of the final fifteen minutes of the movie. The build was not there and then, BAM. Cool sequence followed by The Passion of the Christ. It was a really cool chariot race sequence.\n\nHuston, Kebbell, and Boniadi gave solid performances in the movie they were in, but it just happened to be in the worst movie of 2016. This is not a movie worth seeing in theaters, via Redbox, or even illegal download. I take no pleasure or pride in writing negatively about a film.\n\nCome on, with all the callbacks to the original movie you couldn't even keep Ben-Hur Prisoner 41 in the Galley's? Charlton Heston and Dirk Nowitzki are the greatest No. 41's of all-time...",

            "content": "If you're expecting the new BEN-HUR film to be underwhelming, you won't be disappointed. With the exception of the iconic chariot scene, this new version lacks everything that made the 1959 version starring Charlton Heston the epic classic that it is.\n\nProduced by the same couple who brought us SON OF G-D a few years back, reality TV show creator Mark Burnett and his wife Roma Downey, BEN-HUR (2016) reinterprets General Lew Wallace's sweeping 1880 novel, highlighting the notion of \"forgiveness\" rather than the notion of \"revenge\", which was the predominant theme in the 1959 film. The Burnetts may have been hoping for a miracle when they brought Kazakh-born Timur Bekmanbetov on board to direct. The man, whose resume features ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE SLAYER as a high point in his career to date, is woefully unqualified to take on a film that has such legend attached to it. With the exception of Morgan Freeman who plays Ilderim, an African-Arabian sheik who makes his living competing in and betting on chariot races, the film stars a cavalcade of either unknown or little known actors. Judah is played by Jack Huston (grandson of legendary director and actor John Huston) in what may just be his biggest role yet. He has appeared in quite a few successful movies of late, including HAIL, CAESAR! and AMERICAN HUSTLE, but in roles that went unnoticed by most people. Messala is played by Toby Kebbell, who has a similar looking resume. Other actors include Rodrigo Santoro (THE 33) as Jesus, Nazanin Boniadi (TV's HOMELAND) as Esther (who marries Judah early on in the story), Ayelet Zurer (FUGITIVE PIECES) as Judah's mother, Naomi, and Sofia Black-D'Elia as Judah's sister, Tirzah.\n\nIn this new film, Messala and Tirzah have a thing going but Naomi is not about to let her Jewish Judaean Princess marry a polytheistic, idol worshipping Roman, even if he is Judah's best friend and the family's adopted son. Miffed at his station in life, Messala decides to join the Roman Legion and head off to far flung places to expand the Empire. Successful in battle, he comes back to Jerusalem three years later as the prefect to Pontius Pilate. When a Jewish zealot attempts to assassinate Pilate, Messala holds Judah responsible, sending him to the galleys. There, Judah rows for five years until a naval battle against the Greeks on the Ionian Sea goes badly for the Romans and he is able to get away. He ends up floating to shore where he's rescued by Sheik Ilderim who sees his potential as a chariot driver to make money off the Romans. Judah, however, just wants revenge on the man who destroyed his life and his family. Ilderim, though, convinces him that the best way Judah can get back at Messala is by beating him at the Circus Maximus and taking away his pride. As Ilderim (and the film's tagline) says, the first to finish is the last to die.\n\nClocking in at just over two hours, BEN-HUR (2016) is considerably and mercifully shorter than the 1959 film, which was 3 hours and 42 minutes long (including the wonderful 6-1/2 minute long overture and 3-1/2 minute long entr'acte by Oscar (R) winning composer Miklos Rozsa). However, just getting to the point where Judah is sent to the galleys takes up almost half the film's running time. As a result, the rest of the film seems very rushed. The scenes where Jesus is arrested by the Romans, his journey along the Via Dolorosa and his crucifixion takes up just a few minutes. In an effort to cram everything into two hours, there are too many short scenes. If you suffer from ADD, this is a great film for you.\n\nOther problems abound in this version. To start, these actors are all lightweights. Jack Huston is no Charlton Heston. There's no machismo and no bravado. This Judah is too soft and cuddly to have endured five years in the hull of a ship. As for that ship, we see the war at sea level, mostly through the eyes of the galley slaves. This was an interesting directorial choice that might have been more impactful had we been given more than the occasional aerial perspective. The same can be said with the chariot race, which is the film's centrepiece. It has too many close ups and mid-range shots, and not enough wide angle shots so that we can appreciate the spectacle. It has tension but to nowhere near the same degree as in the 1959 version.\n\nPerhaps the greatest head-scratching moment, though, is saved for the very end of the film. As the closing credits roll, R&B singer Andra Day croons \"The Only Way Out\", which makes no sense at all. Fortunately for audiences, there is a way out. It's called the Exit door and my advice is to run there as fast as you can.\n\nDo yourself a favour and rent or buy yourself a copy of the 1959 version. There's a reason why no other film has won more Oscars (R).",

Sin embargo, la versión más conocida es la de 1959, dirigida por William Wyler y protagonizada por Charlton Heston, la cual obtuvo 11 premios Oscar (incluyendo el de mejor película), resultando en un gigantesco éxito de taquilla.\nAhora, se estrena una cuarta película de \"Ben-Hur\" con una distancia de 57 años respecto a su predecesora (Aunque existe una mini-serie para la televisión del 2010). El encargado de superar o mantener la calidad y la grandilocuencia de las dos versiones anteriores es el director Timur Bekmambetov, quien sorprendió a los amantes de la acción y la ciencia ficción con las cintas de culto \"Guardianes del Día\" y Guardianes de la Noche\", realizadas en Rusia y que no tenían nada que envidiarle a las grandes producciones de Hollywood.  Bekmambetov, quien ya había dirigido en Estados Unidos las películas de alto presupuesto \"Wanted\" (adaptación del cómic de Mark Millar) y \"Abraham Lincoln: Cazador De vampiros\" (adaptación de la novela de Seth-Grahame Smith), le da un aire moderno al relato de Judah Ben-Hur y la rivalidad con su medio hermano Messala Severus (tal vez demasiado moderno, ya que los protagonistas aparecen con pantalones que parecen de mezclilla).

Bekmambetov logra una persecución muy bien lograda, que rehuye de los efectos digitales (salvo en los accidentes de los caballos) y que logra mantener al espectador al borde de su silla. ¿Supera esta secuencia a sus predecesoras? el espectador será el juez. \n\"Ben Hur\" tal vez no logra el mismo sentido épico de imponencia y grandiosidad de las dos versiones anteriores consideradas las películas más caras de la historia en sus respectivas épocas (además, la versión actual dura la mitad de las anteriores), pero logra ser una cinta muy humana, muy entretenida, bien actuada, bien dirigida y con un discurso sutil sobre la tolerancia y el amor que la aleja de las recientes \"películas de fe\" con su discurso barato e impositivo.  \"Ben-Hur\" es otra grata sorpresa que cierra la temporada del Verano y que demuestra que no todos los re-makes son malos.",

Bolstered only by formidably crafted CGI effects, this remake of the timeless classic offers a disposable home cinema entertainment, but ultimately fails to get even closer to the 1959 sword-and-sandals Oscar winner.\n\nThose familiar with Lew Wallace's novel and William Wyler's cinematographic piece of art need not explanation of the story. For the rest, the movie is a tale of the young Jew Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) who loses everything after being falsely accused of treason by his adopted brother, the roman Messala (Toby Kebbell). Sent into slavery on a godforsaken galleon, Judah finds his way back to Jerusalem and driven by desire to get his revenge he faces his brother once again. A blend of dramatic bromance, historical epic and huge elements of Christian-based motives, Timur Bekmambetov's remake is quite a mess due to the fact that it tries to be everything at the same time. This results in a scattered story, uneven pacing and dull dialogues. Add up on top of that a cast that remains hugely unremarkable and you will find no reason to watch this movie except for the excellent CGI effects and several outstanding sequences. \n\nSpeaking of the action part of the movie, the galleon scenes were pretty well done and you will find them breath-taking. With regard to the remake of one of the most legendary ever sequences, the chariot race scene, you will be please if you have not seen the original movie. Spectacular and fast-paced, the CGI effects do their business. Unfortunately, if you have seen the original movie you will miss the passionate grandeur of the sequence, the emotional tension between both actors is missing and simply the CGI effects will leave you with cold feelings. \n\nIn the end, this 2016 Ben-Hur will remain in the history as a failed remake attempt in terms of critical reception and in terms of financial success. Not worthy to see it in the cinema, neither worth spending money for renting it, you might want to wait for some time until it is shown on one of the countless TV channels around Christmas time or other big Christian holiday.",

I missed the directing prowess and verisimilitude and sense of place of the two other versions, and I found the acting wanting, in spite of Morgan Freeman, whose dreadlocks reminded me of Battlefield Earth. The Jesus connection also did not feel organic. If you want epic and entertainment, just re-watch the Heston version; the silent-era version though still has not been bettered.",

I thought the director could have made better use of the 3-D--there weren't too many scenes where things were notably popping out at me. The chariot race was riveting, as expected, as was the sea battle sequence. The acting was solid, and as one critic pointed out, Jack Huston brought notes to his performance which Charlton Heston could not. Like crying, for instance--the imdb trivia page said Heston could not cry and opted to cover his eyes instead. Speaking of crying, I am a crier at movies and I did shed a few tears several times during this movie. For it's 2 hour and 30 minute running time, the movie moves briskly, and I felt the ending arrived rather quickly after the denouement. At least it's concise and doesn't linger too long in any given scene. While the violence looks dialed down by others' standards, there were times when the scenes felt downright brutal and I wanted to avert mine eyes. There were some Cloverfield-ish shots in here where I had difficulty focusing, but it could have been the 3D. For me, this was a \"once is enough\" movie--but it's still worth that one viewing.",

Although, this Ben-Hur does rely on delivering some exciting action sequences than giving a developing story. Sure, 1959 Ben-Hur has won awards and one of the longest films that showed the forgiveness Christian theme character in a properly manner. Can definitely rule out this year's Ben-Hur for even trying to match up with the original. Director Timur Bekmambetov, who is heavily on the visual effects and delivering some insane action sequences like his previous films Wanted, or Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. When it comes to a film like Ben-Hur, which is grounded and a little different type of project for him to handle. The action and visual effects are exciting and thrilling from the naval battle scene with ships crashing into each other and people being flung out of it from the chains they are attached too. Then, the chariot death race sequence was also thrilling and the quick fast editing cuts, as chariots bash into one or the other. Ben-Hur feels like the film can handle the action scenes, the developing story does feel like some moments were brief with the characterizations. Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) and his best friend/ adoptive brother Marsala (Toby Kebbell) in the first hour of the movie try to move at a fast pace of bypassing the development. Judah gets into an accident and Marsala saves him, but still gets overlooked by Judah's mother. Marsala leaves to join the Romans and tries to reclaim his title. Years pass, Marsala returns with the Romans and hopes Judah can help him find any traitors that are against the Romans. Judah and Marsala differences leads them both to being enemies against each other causing Judah to be enslaved for several years. Until, a shipwreck frees Judah and he tries to get his revenge on Marsala for betraying his own family. The only battle that can reclaim his freedom is racing in a chariot race against Marsala.\n\n The script does rush with trying to slow down to have these characters develop. The film was trying to rush to focus on the chariot race, which is the highlight of the movie. The theme of forgiveness is the focus point with Ben-Hur, as he always tries to see the good in everyone. Especially, he aided a boy, who was plotting to take out the leader of the Romans Pilate. The boy's actions is what causes everything to be set in motion and Ben-Hur takes the fall and blame. Christians may enjoy the context of what the movie is trying to portray. Even Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro) does make a few appearances, popping in to help a character out or giving a brief speech about forgiveness. Ben-Hur could have been more if they give a better developing script, while the action sequences is what tried to carry the movie.",

Let's start with my pros: the 2 leads gave the best performances and a honorable mention goes to Rodrigo Santoro for his portrayal of Jesus Christ, the iconic scenes from the original are almost even better this time around especially the chariot race and battle, and the Jerusalem scenery is the best part about this film. Unfortunately these pros cannot save the major cons in this film which are: bland dialogue, snail slow pacing, and an unforgivable ending that would make Mr. Heston roll over his grave. Overall Ben-Hur isn't a terrible movie by any means but since the original film being so iconic and the questionable changes done to this adaption, prevents it from reaching a tolerable outing either.",

            "content": "\"The new 2016 edition of \"Ben-Hur\" comes down as nothing but a cash cow for the right-wing faith-based crowd\"\nDVD Movie Review: Ben-Hur (2016)\nDate Viewed: December 17 2016\nDirected By Timur Bekmambetov (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Wanted)\nScreenplay By Keith Clarke and John Ridley, Based on the 1880 novel \"Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ\" by Lew Wallace\nStarring: Jack Huston, Toby Kebbell, Morgan Freeman, Nazanin Boniadi, Rodrigo Santoro, Sofia Black D'Elia, Ayelet Zurer, Moises Arias, Haluk Bilginer, Pilou Asbaek, Marwan Kenzari and James Cosmo.\n\nHow many times do we have to see \"Ben-Hur\" over and over again before we all go religiously nuts? The new 2016 remake is the fifth adaptation of Lew Wallace's acclaimed 1880 novel, there were the silent film versions from 1907 and 1925, the Oscar-winning William Wyler epic from 1959 and there was even a 2003 animated version of the classic tale. Was there any reason to re-tell this story again? No! The infamous 1959 classic which starred Charlton Heston may have been really, really, really long but it was perfect as it is. The new  big-budget version of \"Ben-Hur\" which bombed spectacularly at the box office was only here just to cash in on the right-wing faith-based crowd.\n\nHow is that so? Jesus (played by Rodrigo Santoro) has a more prominent role here than he had in the 1959 version and the new \"Ben-Hur\" was executive-produced by Mark Burnett and Roma Downey. The visual effects are impressive and the famous chariot race is well-staged but it also features wooden acting, weak storytelling and Morgan Freeman's wacky hairdo. There are no guilty pleasures or even a sort of homosexual thing between brother and brother here, it's just a plain old retelling of a classic story that has nothing new to offer for the faith-based crowd except for a lot of praying and preaching.\n\nThe story centers around a noble Jewish prince named Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) and his adoptive Roman brother Messala (Toby Kebbell). Despite their different points of view, the two have always been loyal and kind to one another but Messala begins to grow jealous for his family's fondness for Judah and his wealthy power. As an act of revenge, Messala joins the Roman army and they barge right into Judah's home where they accuse him of treason. Judah is forced into slavery and his mother (Ayelet Zurer) and sister (Sofia Black D'Elia) are sentenced to be crucified.\n\nAfter serving as a galley slave for five years, Judah manages to escape during a naval battle against Greek rebels. He soon washes ashore and gets found by an African sheik named Ilderim (Morgan Freeman). Sheik Ilderim sells horses for a living to men who want to compete in chariot races and Judah Ben-Hur no question wants to compete in the race because his now powerful adoptive brother took away everything from him and now he wants revenge. Sure, Judah Ben-Hur is thinking about revenge now but when Jesus comes in do to some healing where in for more faith-based preaching. Oh yeah, Judah Ben-Hur also has a love interest and she's a Jewish slave named Esther (Nazanin Boniadi). Their relationship couldn't be more bland and sucky and the fierce rivalry between Judah and Messala is just a magnet for staging big action sequences.\n\n\"Ben-Hur (2016)\" was directed by Timur Bekmambetov who made the bloody action thriller \"Wanted\" and \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\" which I liked more than other people did. The production design and the costumes are all there but the screenplay by Keith Clarke and John Ridley (12 Years a Slave) barely has any biblical value in it and the movie doesn't even try to find a new identity for itself.\n\nJack Huston who is the nephew of actress Anjelica Huston and the grandson of acclaimed American director John Huston has a real screen presence and is capable of doing real work but in this movie, he's just as stiff and washed up as Robert Pattinson from the \"Twilight\" movies. Lew Wallace's ancient tale will always be an embodied treasure and the 1959 William Wyler classic which won 11 Oscars will always be looked at as a grand cheesy masterpiece. The new \"Ben-Hur\" on the other hand will be looked at as a surreal\nmiscalculation.",

Judging this one independently, it was pretty entertaining, at times difficult to follow, but there's something about Romany type war films, that floats my boat. Whether it's the gladiatorial combat or the ease of the concept I find appealing, I'm not sure. In truth, I didn't find this was littered with battles, nor was it as brutal as some of the other similarly themed movies out there. It did pack in a lot of story, and incorporated the whole Jesus and the crucifixion tale very cleverly, but I guess the shorter length did make the final confrontation between the two brothers / rivals a little bit less dramatic. The ending was somewhat fairytale like, and slightly cheesy for this genre, but it makes a change from good killing bad, with good winning the girl. I would love to see how this compares to the original but I'm just not sure I loved it enough to want to plan a whole afternoon dedicated to that just yet, so maybe one for a lengthy plane journey if it were a available mid flight.",

Morgan Freeman as the desert sheik didn't seem to give a damn about the horses, Messala wasn't mean enough, Jesus wasn't impressive enough, the music was impressive either (unlike Miklos Rossa\"s superb score), and the acting just wasn't up to the par of the 1959 version--people like Jack Hawkins, and Hugh Griffiths. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I saw it once, but it's not one I'll watch over and over again, or quote from (\"We keep you alive to serve this ship.\")  If you've seen this one, but not the 1959 version, you might be impressed, but rent the old one--it is superb. Also, I have a beef with whoever did the leprosy  makeup--the 1959 movie, which I saw when I was 9 years old, gave me nightmares for years and had me searching my skin for leprosy every time I had an itch.

Overall, I guess it's on a hiding to nothing as the 50s version is so iconic. And I still easily prefer that version more. But this didn't deserve the battering it got from some critics. It's actually pretty good. The chariot race was quite gripping. My only other gripe is the representation of Jesus as a being a bit of a millennial. But yeah...pretty good overall.",

The chariot race is fun, and the following ten minutes or so are amusing for the rushed and slapdash way they cram the entire Jesus/leprosy subplots in, but aside from that the film is just tedious to watch.
