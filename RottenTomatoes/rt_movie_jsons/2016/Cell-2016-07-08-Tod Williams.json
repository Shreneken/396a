It's a mess throughout and lacks any tension, freshness or uniqueness.\n\nCusack and Jackson should be a good pairing, yet I don't even recall anything from their respective performances just minutes after watching. Both are capable of a lot better than this, especially Jackson. No-one sticks out behind that duo, though it's neat to see 'Prison Break' actor Stacy Keach involved.\n\nOne to avoid, I'd say.",

Its prob because Cusack is never really likable, always comes off as a dlck. Or maybe because Sam Jackson doesnt say MuthaF&$@& not even once and that was disappointing actually. But i watched this late and alone and i think it built alot of tension had a few good jump scares and was unsettling. The ending gets lots of bad press too and idk why. there are enough clues to know what happened and its dark. I would have liked to see a snip of what Tom and the chic and kid ended up doing but oh well maybe ill read the book now since i heard its way bettwr than the movie and maybe it will give their ending.

            "content": "Poorly shot, indifferently staged, badly written and lacking of coherent scares or respect to its novel counterpart. Cell is one of the worst Stephen King adaptations to date and also acts as a true example on how you should not adapt a book that is written so well but poorly translated for the big screen. The story follows comic book artist Clay who is on his way to meet up with his son after landing a successful deal with his publishers on the latest graphic novel series he's working on. However, terror strikes when people start turning into mindless zombies by answering their cellphones, along the way he meets up with Tom McCourt, Alice Maxwell and computer genius Jordan. Together, they travel across the desolated US as the human population slowly decreases while also unraveling the mysteries of the pulse that turns everyone into zombies. Compared to the newly successful Stephen King adaptations in 2017 like the terrifying IT, Gerald's Game and 1922. Cell is the adaptation that alienated Stephen King fanatics and is a plague in the history of Hollywood movies. This is the film that is doomed from beginning to end and I'm not kidding about that; I read the book it was based on and from the moment the film flows after a decent opening sequence, Cell starts to go downhill as it suffers from a number of setbacks that are inferior to the books powerful moments. The problem with this adaptation is that the new elements incorporated into the film lacks the greatness of the book and adds more plot holes and unanswered questions. Its clear that things went South real fast during the middle of the film as the lack of character development is purely absent by the time the film abruptly ends. The directing is awkward, shoddy and bland that sets new directions in the history of bad film making, nearly every element used are just recycled junk from past movies. The way the film was shot is so bad it made my eyes hurt (Rapid use of cuts, excessive zooming scenes, laughable zombie sound effects and lazy camera work as if it was shot on a plastered handheld video camera filled with poor lighting that makes you think the budget for the film has been reduced for the next half of the film) and finally, the changes from the book is purely absurd that wasted the efforts of everyone involved during pre-production on the film plus the zombies are just as lame as the movie itself. The only two positive things about this film are a few nicely shot scenes during the apocalypse at the airport (one where Clay sees people acting odd after answering their cellphones including a violent death during the subway sequence) and the casting of the film is good from John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, Isabelle Fuhrman too Owen Teague as Clay Riddell, Tom McCourt, Alice Maxwell and Jordan respectively but these four deserve to be in better movies than in this film for good reason. Director Tod Williams is one of the worst Horror directors of all time as he shows how much of a huge hack he is in the genre when he made both Paranormal Activity 2 and this film. His work in the first Paranormal Activity sequel is ok but slightly better than what he did here as he butchered Stephen King's incredible story into a crumbling magnitude that sinks faster than a quicksand and shows that these type of films should be handed to those who admire the work of Horror Maestro Stephen King. Cell overall is one of the worst adaptations of a Stephen King novel that is easily forgettable and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. This is one of the worst zombie films of all time. I am giving this movie a 2/10.",

If anyone could make this movie less bland and predictable, it would be Samuel. Unfortunately, not even he could save this movie from the eternal hell of forgettable movies.\n\nThis movie got so painful to watch that I couldn't handle listening to Cusack's monotone voice any longer. If you asked me what happened after the first half of the movie, I honestly couldn't give you a decent answer.

The filming style made me feel like I was having vision problems in many scenes and just down right amateurish in most others. Aside from this film version making no sense whatsoever throughout, the ending is just ridiculously confusing. While King seems to borrow from The Strain trilogy in the book, the ending of this film is even more so, and then it takes a turn into the Matrix. Terrible.

The finished product however is a bit of a mess, large sections of the book are skipped over and the ending just looks ridiculous on the screen.  Reading the book you felt the central character's desperation to be reunited with his son at any cost, here on screen father and son might as well be strangers.

            "content": "Review:\r\nWhen I saw that this was a Samuel L. Jackson movie, which didn't even make a million dollars at the box office, I knew that it must have been terrible, and now that I've watched it, I can totally understand why. As soon as the zombie activity started at the beginning of the film, I fell asleep and I lost complete interest in the plot. I struggled to keep my eyes open through the rest of the movie, and I personally think that it was a terrible and cheaply made. John Cusack plays a graphic novel creator, Clay Riddell, who is on his way home from selling some of his work. At the airport, he calls his family on his cell phone but his battery runs out, so he heads to the phone box and witnesses people becoming extremely violent whilst foaming at the mouth and killing each other. After escaping the strange goings on in the airport, he realises that there strange behaviour is something to do with there cell phones, hence the title of the film, and he eventually hooks up with a train driver, Tom McCourt (Samuel L. Jackson), who helps Clay to get home to his loved ones. On there journey, Clays neighbour, Alice Maxwell (Isabelle Fuhrman) joins them to get to safety but as the Pulse starts to take over humanity, nowhere is safe. I'm not one for zombie movies, so I really wasn't interested in that aspect of the movie but I thought there would be other elements which could have been entertaining. How wrong was I! The acting was pretty poor from these top actors, because I didn't get a sense of intensity or shock throughout the movie. It also seemed like the zombies were just a bunch of extras with make-up on there face, so there wasn't a sense of reality or horror. Some of the graphic scenes at the airport were pretty shocking but apart from that, it really wasn't anything amazing. The whole concept about people catching a bug from using the phone, was great, which is why my expectations were quite high but the director really didn't take full advantage of the cast and Stephen Kings original story. Disappointing!\r\n\r\nRound-Up:\r\nWith such a massive career, which has earned him millions of dollars, Samuel L. Jackson is allowed to make some poor movies from time to time. The sad thing is Cusack and Jackson did try and make the crazy Pulse situation seem realistic, which must have been hard because it did seem quite ridiculous most of the time. Anyway, the film was directed by Tod Williams, 48, who also brought you the Adventures of Sebastian Cole, The Door In The Floor and Paranormal Activity 2. Taking on a Stephen King novel, must have been a big task for this director, who really done a terrible job adapting the book for the big screen. Movies like I Am Legend, proves that it is possible to pull off a zombie movie without constantly running around with guns trying to fight them off, so maybe they should redo this film with a director who could bring depth and reality to the project.\r\n\r\nBudget: N/A\r\nWorldwide Gross: $735,000\r\n\r\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/sci-fi/thrillers, starring John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, Stacy Keach, Isabelle Fuhrman, Joshua Mikel and Clark Sarullo. 2/10",

These are questions that have been at the forefront of many a coffee date discussion, movie club forum or family dinner. Questions like who exactly is/was the \"thing\" (The Thing), is it a dream or reality (Inception), what was in the briefcase (Pulp Fiction) and now with this long completed and finally just released Stephen King adaptation we can add why exactly was John Cusack's in danger graphic novelist Clay Riddell so keen to pop on his beanie in the midst of a do or die cell phone lead apocalypse?\n\nIt's a question we may sadly never have answered and probably the only thing that will stick with you once Tod William's (where has the director who made The Door in the Floor gone?) film reaches its credit sequence, as this adaptation of one of King's least regarded books is one of those films just waiting to join the likes of The Wicker Man remake as a film that's just so bizarre and random it's hard to know who did and why they decided this was a film the public wanted.\n\nIn all its random glory however, if I was being totally honest, after all the negative press and jokes being made at its expense, Cell is not nearly as bad as it could've been when watched with the right mindset.\n\nA seriously daft idea that induces a large amount of unintended laughter, Cell has its fair share of \"what the\" moments and it's a little sad seeing the likes of John Cusack (although he seems to have sold his movie soul some time ago now) and Samuel L. Jackson act through some insanely bizarre situations; I truly can't even begin to explain a scene involving a field of sleeping cell phone zombies, the film actually has some decent scenes and ideas that make this a B grade experience you can sit back and laugh at or with and an experience best watched with a room full of friends all up to witness a film that should never have made it to the cold light of day.\n\nThrough the history of movies we've been treated to King adaptation gold, from experiences like The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Shining and The Mist, Cell is certainly not one of those and is certainly not a film of cinematic virtue but it's an experience that deserves to be seen as even if you hate every minute of this oddball ride its likely you've never seen anything like it before and if you solve the beanie mystery, please let me know.\n\n2 troll lol lol's out of 5\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

Sadly however this doesn't come close to what the book offered.\n\nThe film follows Clay, a artist, who after realizing that a weird cell phone signal has sent the world into a crazed apocalyptic state he is determined to travel back to New England to get his son. Along the way he meets other survivors along the rest in his quest for his son.\n\nNow for a film starring John Cusack (who also co-produced it), Samuel L Jackson and Isabelle Furhman all the actors just look like they are phoning it in. Cusack and Jackson almost always have a bland emotionless look on there face making it clearly apparent that there wasn't a strong love for this film by them. It doesn't help either that the film has such a hard time grabbing you in. I never sensed any danger for the characters or truly even cared as there wasn't much backstory given for anyone to make me care about them.\n\nThe worst thing is that even with knowledge of the book I was still confused because they often failed to give full explanations for things in the film leaving a casual viewer likely confused. I can imagine if I was confused as to what was going on then almost anyone else would be even more lost. By the end however knowing that they fully changed the ending was even worse, the end is a total letdown for the film and just feels almost like a cheap cop out.\n\nFrom the beginning scene in the airport though they set your hopes so high, the beginning is tense and violent and starts with a rush only to slow down too much. Even with the occasional good moment from the infected in the film the constant horrible CGI really dumbs it down.\n\nOverall with this letdown of a film just read the book instead.\n\n\nScore :\n\n\n2/10\n\nhttps://apocalypticdemise.com/2016/07/13/cell-2016-review/",

Sam Jackson phones in his performance (possibly due to director error) and John Cusak responds by over acting in an effort to bring up the average of all the other actors. While Stephen King's idea was genuine and evoked a lot of emotion in others, it did not translate well to film. \n\n\nThis movie moves a million miles an hour. We are told things about the 'zombies' by characters who have no reason for knowing all the information that they are describing. Throughout the film you are unsure of exactly how many days this has been going on as it seems there were a lot of major cuts.

            "content": "I have been a huge Stephen King fan from the time I have, well,  started reading. So its been natural for me to check out almost every film adaptions of his novels. While I do understand that novel adaptions are usually very hit or miss (except for YA I presume) as its much harder to please those who haven't read the text before. Nevertheless As a true King fan, I have even come to support some of his failed adaptions such as Dreamcatcher, Secret Window (the remake), The Mist etc, hence you can understand my excitement for this one. The concept of this film based on King's lesser successful novels seemed interesting, especially in today's world where our reliance on our cell phones has reached sky's limit (putting it lightly). Plus the re pairing of actors John Cusack & Samuel L Jackson after King's widely overlooked yet awesome 1408, seemed like a great idea. So how is this film? Pretty terrible! Yup, this is not a good movie. If there was anything I could compare it to, it would be director M.Night Shyamalan's The Happening (except slightly less idiotic). Everything about the movie was just wrong and I honestly gave it a lot of room, a lot of space to make errors and not flow the same. Because ultimately you want to be surprised by the movie. You ultimately want the director to make it his own just a little bit, put his spin on something and have it shine even more. And I did, I watched the film to the very end. Checked behind the credits and everything. And now I wish I would have gone on for the rest of my life without knowing this movie existed. Instead of cleverly using the plot, the makers decided to just rip off the very popular TV series The Walking Dead for a 98 minute film. While The Walking Dead is produced as a character-driven thrill ride whereas this film decided to be nothing but a low budget borefest. The story follows Clay Riddell (John Cusack), a comic book artist estranged from his family who arrives at the Boston airport and is traveling home when all of a sudden, some sort of signal scrambles the brains of everyone currently using a cellphone. Most of them immediately turn into mindless, murderous zombies in a bit of staged mayhem that does not convince, unfortunately. Clay runs for his life. He meets up with random fellow survivors - the train conductor Tom McCourt (Samuel L. Jackson) and the teenage neighbor Alice (Isabelle Fuhrman). Together, they form the vague notion to travel north into New Hampshire. Clay wants to find his young son. But the roads are thick with \"phoners,\" who are beginning to manifest new abilities that suggest the development of a psychic hive mind. At first I felt the opening shots of this film set the tone for its overall success. They hold and pan shakily over the airport bustle as blocky opening credits cover most of the frame. It is hard to see anything in this visual climate, but what we do see is an airport in which literally every person has their phone in their hands. I mean, does nobody read books at the airport anymore? Do people actually talk on their phones at the urinal? Once the dust settles, Clay is in denial. Having just gotten off the phone with his estranged wife, and later texting her to a response of absolute gibberish, his wife is likely zombified ). Clay, ignoring these signs, decides to go out in search for his wife and son instead of staying in his apartment where he is objectively safe. Even though I am sure the opening setting of an airport on paper seems like a great idea especially to gather a multitude of cellphone users who end up as victims of the so-called pulse. The result is a collection of sometimes hallucinatory images. Such as the security guard who tears apart his four-legged friend. Or that frenzied teenage girl who runs head-on against a wall, with a toothless, bloody smile as a result. And as icing on the cake there's a destructive plane crash (unfortunately with the use of some lousy-looking special effects). Sadly enough there is not much exciting to see after this beginning. The film looks just like a standard zombie flick afterwards, with some survivors hopping around who are being chased by a horde of frenzied \"phoners\". The film is also filled with plot holes, where everything which seems important is left unexplained. Who's the man in the red hoodie? Why does he pop-up everywhere? There is some gibberish about what the zombies are and how they get created, but there isn't any payoff - and there doesn't seem to be any rules. How come some people become cell phone zombies and some people don't? They're all hearing the same signal. I can understand if this movie was trying to symbolically represent our modern day society and over-reliance on technology, but it doesn't do that well at all. There are no parallels drawn or even characters that care. They all just chug along with no purpose. Even though the film boasts of some delightfully macabre imagery - like a spray truck driving over a field of unconscious \"phoners,\" spraying them with gasoline, so a character played by Stacy Keach can fire a flaming arrow to burn them all alive (this is an actual thing that happens in this movie). Some of these moments are bright spots in a film that desperately needed them. But they're few and far between. That's a lot of plot for a silly zombie movie, and the film grows too bogged down by it, particularly as our protagonists start to report seeing the same antagonistic figure in their dreams (a common King trope). This all goes nowhere, and it doesn't feel that fast. There are scenes in the film where the characters seem to be very close to each other, and have a strong bond with each other but the film moves at such an accelerated pace even someone just casually watching this would struggle to find the close relationships plausible as none of the people portrayed have had long enough to get to know each other. This would have been a lot better if the characters were actually interesting, but there are no redeeming qualities about any of them. They're as exciting as a cardboard, with even duller personalities. The narrative drags so hard in the second act that it is easy to ignore their performances. It is easy to ignore much of what is going on, as a matter of fact. By the time we start approaching the climax, all we can hope for is an ending. We get there, eventually, but not before being subjected to a very tepid climax that attempts to achieve multiple things while succeeding at none. Couple everything with uninspired direction by Tod Williams (Paranormal Activity 2) all around and some unconvincing performances, and you have something of a trial to get through. During the entire length of the movie, I couldn't help but keep asking \"What happened to John Cusack??\". Now Samuel L Jackson makes his share of schlocky B-movies, but he also makes some good ones in between. Lately it seems that John Cusack has taken the Nicolas Cage route of becoming insignificant in cinema. Where Cusack used to make memorable and crowd-pleasing movies, his catalog of recent movies have been average at best - and unwatchable at worst. Here, he seems to be chugging along and speaking all his lines in a low raspy voice, I guess to seem more dramatic - but his lines have no significance, so it's the opposite of dramatic, just plain boring. Samuel L. Jackson seems to be sleep walking the whole time, while Isabella Fuhrman & Stacy Keach are just fine. On the whole, 'Cell' is both a frustrating & a corny film hereby making it the worst Stephen King adaption I have ever seen.",

The literalness of which, I feel is too simplistic a device to shove in your face throughout  the film, with waning believability as the film progresses to its end.

The well written characters from the book are nothing more than just carboard cutouts on a poorly animated backdrop. Changing them substantially from their book counterparts also doesn't add any appeal to the film. Actually the changes made to the script are just another nail in this movie's coffin. It's not as much a horror as a thriller with no thrills at all. It has a few moments that are well shot and nicely acted, but it only adds to the overall frustration with the product. It's sad, because with such a great cast and a very good source material, this movie had a lot of potential. A wasted opportunity, as with most of King's adaptations.",

A world of people's constant use of cell phones turning them into mindless maniacs. From the opening scene, taking place in a airport and seeing about everyone using there cell phones and at a moment the electronic signal reprograms everyone that is using their phones into maniac killers. Sure, the film does make them look like mindless zombies, as they chase people down, beat them with blunt objects, and walk around the area. Only at night, all the mind-controlled people are synced to walking around the cell towers or collapsed in the middle of the field playing some song. Cell has a mystery aspect to the concept and could have been an entertaining idea. It fails terribly in going any further into details about the apocalyptic madness of mobile networks causing havoc and turning people into mindless maniacs. Stephen King's stories are usually hits and misses and the endings are the judgment calls if it ties well. Cell plays out an apocalyptic survival story of a divorced father Clay (John Cusack) trying to get home to find his family during this crisis. Seeking the help from Tom (Samuel L. Jackson) and his neighbor Alice (Isabelle Fuhrman) as they travel across distance and avoiding the horde of \"phoners.\"  The film could have had a better direction that could have build suspense, characters, and make it entertaining. Except at times, it was slightly boring, as the script gives unnecessary dull character drama. The suspense is only build with characters running from set piece to another being chased by the horde. The interaction between the characters felt unrealistic like Clay and Tom who have just met and looks like they are best friends. The dialogue is atrocious, which could have improved. From the first 10 minutes of the movie, Clay has landed and witness the people around him change in seconds to killers and chaos breaks loose, as planes crash, people killing each other, and everything crumbles quickly. The acting is also cheesy and the transition with the people turning into mindless killers was also weird and felt like the extras were not told much about their performances and reactions. Also, the ending was suppose to be the point of leaving things haunting and unease, but it felt out of place in a terrible direction. Like it was trying to pull off a twist and ends in a dumb haunting feel. The ending needed some work of giving a better cliffhanger closure of the concept and plot, but ends in a cheesy stupid way. Cell is the worst at giving a sharp science fiction direction for a Stephen King story, has a terrible script and direction, and cheesy acting. This King story being adapted into film is a definite miss.",
