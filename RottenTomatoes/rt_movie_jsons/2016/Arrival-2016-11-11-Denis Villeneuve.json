            "content": "Arrival is by far the best movie covering the subject of ufo's and aliens. This movie is so beautiful from beginning to end.  Even the music is special.  You won't find the normal action you would see in a sci-fi movie, but it is more interesting with every scene. Don't worry, there are still scenes that make you nervous :)\n\nThis is also the most realistic movie regarding what would happen if our friends from outer space really did land on Earth. Though, Contact is right there as well. \n\nThe movie shows how easy it is for humans to make assumptions that lead unnecessary disaster. It also shows the importance of language and understanding each other, even when it may seem impossible. \n\nThe cast is small so you can focus on the theme of the movie and really think, \"What would I do if I had to translate a language from an alien race that sounds nothing like ours?!\"  Amy makes it look easy. \n\nAmy Adams delivers such an amazing performance and dominates in this mostly male cast. Her role in this film really inspired me. \n\nIf you are looking for big special effects and a war between man and extraterrestrial, this may not be your favorite movie. I still think you should watch it because it really does make you think. \n\nIf you don't watch it, the main point is that humanity needs to work together to accomplish the goals we need to survive. This is OUR planet and eventually we will have to put aside our differences for the greater good before we destroy everything due to ego.",

            "content": "OK so what I'm about to say is very simple, but i'll stand by it because it's true: If you like fantastic movies, you really need to see Arrival. You see I'm a huge fan of the UFO topic in general, I think it's extremely fascinating. I'm not sure how I went 7 years without seeing Arrival, but I'm sure glad I did.\n\nYes, Arrival is a movie about aliens visiting earth in the form of 12 enormous, mysterious alien craft. But to just call Arrival a \"UFO movie\" is not doing it anywhere near enough justice. The movies central themes are about human nature, how we perceive others and how we look at life and the way we communicate in general.\n\nAmy Adams has never been better as the reluctant language expert called aboard to to figure out what the mysterious beings want with us. Jeremy Renner is also very good here as well as the scientist brought aboard, but it's Adams who shines. I'd call it a must-see.\nhttp://themoviepad.com",

Its a relatively atmospheric film, with looming music used in the background, not dissimilar to that present in other previous sci-fi films, most notably Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It also reminded me somewhat of Jodie Foster in the film Contact from the 1990s.\n\nIts a somewhat deep film that makes you think about how threats are handled, at a global level, the responses by various governments and the like. If anything, I found it refreshing that in this instance, the US didn't exactly go in 'all guns blazing' and I appreciated that the main character, Louise Banks, tries very hard to understand and see things from the unknowns' point of view.

Arrival also shows, with a lot of tension and drama, that the solution to miscommunication is more communication and a commitment to the idea that most people (or aliens) are not out to destroy you. \n\nI couldn't quite go for the last portion of the film where the purpose of the alien language was revealed, but in general I think Villeneuve has made yet another excellent film.",

            "content": "Despite being critically acclaimed, 'Arrival' is another one of those films that is praised to the heavens with critics but has wildly divided audiences judging from the nature of both the positivity and negativity. Though it has to be said that the positive reviewers have been far more mature than the negative ones, many of which to me being disgustingly condescending.\n\n'Arrival' is a very different sci-fi film, and one can definitely see why people will love it and be moved by it as well as seeing why people will hate it and be alienated. To me, 'Arrival' is not as good as reputed and is not a masterpiece, but even if it didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least. From personal opinion there are far worse films out there that are far more deserving of 1/10, and it would be insulting to put 'Arrival' down there with them. Even if the film didn't much for me, the good things would still be acknowledged and there would be real effort to be respectful of other people's opinions regardless of agreeing or disagreeing with them rather than being insulting and inventing ridiculous and untrue conspiracy theories. Those who hated it do need to grow up and start accepting that not everybody hates this film and that those who loved it are being genuine, and no being angry at being disappointed by it is not an excuse. Coming from a younger film lover than most on this site who's autistic and disabled but those have not gotten in the way of being understanding of people's opinions, what's your excuse?\n\nBack to my thoughts on the film, 'Arrival' is a meditatively paced film, and is not an action filled or jam packed with constant narrative. While this may understandably alienate viewers, neither of these are necessarily bad things especially when there are great to masterpiece films that are the same. Of the four films seen of Denis Villeneuve so far, 'Arrival' may be my least favourite, and his most polarising, least violent and most gentle, but that is just testament to how very good 'Prisoners' is and how fantastic 'Incendies' and 'Sicario' are.\n\nThe criticisms are understandable and am in agreement with some. It does drag in the middle act, softening and slacking too much. It does get confusing in the later stages, where things can get ridiculous and predictable.\n\nForest Whittaker and particularly Michael Stuhlbarg's characters are underutilised and underwritten with both having very little to do, the two do make the most of their roles one has to give them that.\n\nHowever, 'Arrival' does look wonderful. This is particularly true in Bradford Young's cinematography, being fluid and its tactile quality is of sheer beauty. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed and lit, the special effects have grand spectacle and the editing is some of the best of its year.\n\nJohann Johannsson's music score is another standout, it has a haunting creepiness and has a heart-pulsating and emotional beat. It not only adds a huge amount to the film, it also enhances it. Denis Villeneuve's direction is his most subtle and least hard-hitting, which is not only a good thing but the right thing, the approach he gave to 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' would have ruined an atmosphere that's the complete opposite.\n\nIn terms of how it's written, 'Arrival' is not perfect but it has a movingly raw emotion, thoughtfulness, subtly suspenseful mystery and gives a compelling realism to its character especially the protagonist. Likewise the story (yes there is one), with a poignant emotion and a clever and powerful, if perhaps not the most logical, twist.\n\nThe acting is one of 'Arrival's' best assets, all round it's very good even if some characters are better realised than others. Amy Adams in particular is astounding, she has rarely been more poignant. Jeremy Renner also underplays effortlessly.\n\nAll in all, divisive film but count me as one of the people who liked it but in an appreciation way than a loved it way. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

On a cinematic level, this film is near perfect. Denis Villeneuve manages to create a synthesis of the real-world environment with excellent CGI, creating a more grounded,\nrealistic alien film that isn't very common. The score is unbeatable, with the heart-wrenching melody of Max Richter's \"On the nature of daylight\" swelling in the epilogue, emphasising the heart-wrenching climax of the film.\nOf course, Amy Adams is superb (as always), as she so fluently, pardon the pun, portrays a confident linguist who creates a realistic balance between her career and her motherhood. This is an incredible character that Amy Adams fantastically portrays. Jeremy Renner is great too,\nas is Forest Whitaker, but Amy Adams is definitely the star here.\nTo conclude, I implore you to watch this film! It is\ngroundbreaking, as it has not only completely redefined the sci-fi genre for me, but it has reshaped my philosophy regarding mortality and love, and made me think of things in different ways. The film forces you to delve deep into\nyour own life, it forces you to confront your feelings and your regrets, yet you're never taken out of the film - you remain completely immersed in Villeneuve's frighteningly authentic world.

            "content": "HEAVY SPOILERS\nAn impressively complex yet comprehensive Science Fiction/Thriller story that doubles as a commentary on the importance of language. As foreshadowed by the protagonists Louise (Amy Adams) initially interaction with her co-lead Ian (Jeremy Renner) this is an exploration on the universal necessity of communication between sentient creatures. This is inclusive of not only humans and aliens but of humanity itself. The film also successfully presents an argument for why language is the most important weapon. Not to hurt or destroy but to defuse a conflict and mutually benefit everyone. Several factors come into play that raise the stakes of the movie. The first is the inability to communicate which plays out a number of different ways among the nations. Fear and paranoia are exploited by both the media and internet personalities which leads to protests and an assassination attempt later in the film. Pressure is placed on the governments to give answers they don't have. Thus tensions are placed on relationships between the military authority and Louise which slowly escalates and crescendos at the end and almost results in the death of our protagonists. The next factor is miscommunication which plays out as the alien language translating to \"gift weapon\" to each major location the aliens landed. This causes mistrust and fear between the world powers and they cut off communication for each other. Slowly but surely they begin to mobilize against the aliens believing them to want planetary control. Louise frantically tries to deescalate the situation to no avail. She knowing communication is the best way to solve this and believing the aliens to be friendly takes matters into her own hands and goes to talk to the aliens herself. Entering the chamber she  exposes herself to their atmospheric accommodations and talks face to...head? With one of the aliens whom she has come to know. She learns that they do indeed wish to gift them all a weapon but the weapon is not a scientific advancement or a destructive tool of conquest. Each power was given a piece of their language. Before departing Louise is given their entire language by the alien and when she returns she realizes she can understand it. She also begins to realize something else. Throughout the film we see what we thought were flashbacks to Louise's life and the death of her daughter. But it turns out that the film utilizes the theory that language determines the way your brain thinks and see's the world. Using this they introduce the concept that the alien language is a palindrome. Its the same backwards as it is forwards. Because of these things Louise is not having flash backs but flash forwards due to her increasing exposure to their language. Now she is able to see how everything in her life will play out and manipulate time to gain access to the phone number of the leading force of hostility towards the aliens. Using language she is able to reach him in an emotional place due to her ability to hear what she said in the future and prevent the attack on the aliens. Using only her words and the capabilities of language she prevents a major military conflict. The film wraps up with a corny but cute \"I wouldn't change a thing\" moment that is flipped on its head between our two leads as Louise is literally choosing to not change a single decision she has yet to make. However I will say she is able to see her own divorce in the future and it is implied she allowed things to happen the same way so that leaves me questioning why she would choose to go down the same path and not try and prevent it. But I suppose she can only remember the future not feel it in the moment so perhaps the nuance is that she has fallen in love with him currently and knows someday things won't be the same and she will fall out of love. It is human nature to do something that you desire despite knowing it will only end in pain so I suppose it does make sense but it also could be because she wants to experience the existence of her daughter and all the love and happiness that she has brought but also has yet to bring. Brings up a lot of ethical questions of selfishness and selflessness, is she being selfish in going down the same path or selfless in giving her daughter life even for a short time. Either way this is a movie that rewards thinking and knows how to subvert expectations in a satisfying way. In addition it presents a compelling argument about language and an entertaining exploration of a potentially possible scenario someday. I just wish the visuals weren't so cold and gray. It felt very bleak and for me that just makes it less appealing to ever revisit. But things are rarely perfect and this was still a hit on the nail for me. Give it a watch if it sounds like your thing.",

Their mysterious presence and the tense build-up to their arrival is expertly handled. The characters trying to learn and understand their unique language in an effort to communicate with them was fascinating to watch unfold. The discoveries and tension keep building up until they come to fruition in an amazing climax. Amy Adams is sympathetic, albeit a bit on the meeker side for someone who's such an accomplished scientific figure. But still an engaging performance nonetheless. My only major issue is the ending resolution, where it's revealed that (SPOILERS!) Amy Adams's character knew that her daughter was going to die of cancer and cause her husband to leave in grief, yet still chooses to go along with it anyway because it's \"worth it\". Which is frustrating, because I could easily see this working if this was the only way she could preserve peace between Earth and the aliens via those time visions she received. But the movie implies that she still has the choice to not go through with it. That she merely chooses to do so out of some forced attachment to an imaginary daughter that she only saw for a couple of visions, some of which involved her in immense pain and grief during her final years of life. It almost comes across as some unsettling warped pro-life angle to this messed up scenario. Why give someone life if you know they're going to die a horrible death in their youth and cause so much misery? Why not just adopt? There's not even abortion involved, it's just the absence of procreation. And this all could've been avoided if they just implied that this had to happen, that this wasn't her choice. It would've made the ending that mirrors the beginning so much more powerful with the movie's themes about time being a circle. I know it's just one flaw, but it's a major one that really drags down the movie's otherwise fantastic score for me. Regardless, the visual artistry and alien linguistics plotline more than make up for the movie's drawbacks. A skyrocketing experience like no other.",

Just like the previous movies, the second time viewing with some prior understanding made me appreciate this piece of art. \n\nThe music and cinematography resolved so well with each other. Whenever the characters came into the spacecraft, it was an entirely immersive, quiet, yet slightly intense because I, like the characters, were stepping into the unknown. Like Enemy, the whole scenes were filled with one blue color, creating a sad yet again immersive tone. \n\nJust as immersive was the performance by Amy Adams. Her character had to deal with a trauma while talking to these aliens. Such sadness filled her face, as well as the voiceover. \n\nThis time Denis explored the dual nature of language. It can divide as well as unite people. It's a weapon as well as a gift. Denis cleverly reaffirmed the main purpose of language as a gift by capitalizing on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Not only that, this usage also became a way to beautifully explore the nature of time and apply it to build Amy Adams's character and how she confronted her trauma. I just loved how everything seamlessly coalesced and nothing felt forced.\n\nBesides that one exposition scene that explained the nature of writing and language, I don't have any problem with this movie.\n\nOverall, a beautiful, emotional, and immersive movie with a daring theme about a common tool that can unite us all. 9.5/10",

            "content": "Some claim that Denis Villeneuve is the new Christopher Nolan. Admittedly, both clearly have a drive for the extraordinary. But a look beneath the surface shows that the two directors can hardly be compared. While Nolan repeatedly overdoes it with his penchant, as he did most recently with Tenet, Villeneuve's Arrival shows that, as a presumed Nolan counterpart, he takes a completely different approach. In contrast to Nolan's repetitive brainfuck, the Canadian created what is arguably one of the most intelligent sci-fi films of recent years.\n\nWhat Villeneuve clearly has ahead of Nolan is his knack with the ensembles in his films. No actress could have embodied the lead role of linguist Louise Banks better than Amy Adams. Although Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are also likable in the supporting roles of a physicist and military colonel, Adams carries the film single-handedly. The character is fragile and conflicted from the start, and because of intimate glimpses into her private and thought life, we always know why that is. The way Adams manages to suggest this rollercoaster ride of emotions is quite great. She usually has barely seconds to catch her breath before she has to move on from profound thoughts about her deceased daughter back to the mysterious enigma of the aliens landing on Earth. Even the way Adams behaves in some scenes while trying to communicate with the mysterious beings is comprehensible. You immediately want to join her and assist in the difficult research. This makes for a complex film character with numerous facets that you can empathise with at all times. Yes, Adams often plays the broken woman with a dark past. Only in Arrival she certainly doesn't always come across as an emotional wreck, but rather determined and enthusiastic about her responsibility despite her stroke of fate. Jeremy Renner's character, the physicist Ian Donnelly, is a nice touch and shares many interesting scenes with Louise. However, he is overshadowed by Adam throughout. This has little to do with Renner's performance, which is excellent as always, but the character simply lacks complexity. The same applies to Whitaker's Colonel Weber, who, after an initially strong presence, plays second fiddle more and more as time goes on. This is also less due to Whitaker's acting than to the lack of X-factor in his character.\n\nSo why is Arrival now so much more thoughtful and better than, say, Tenet? Villeneuve shows such a fine hand in his directing that the film never comes across like one of the many forced sci-fi flicks with mega effects and explosions, but rather resembles a slowly told thriller. Not because there is so much suspense, Arrival is no Sicario by any means, but until the end you don't know what the aliens' intention is and to what extent the protagonist's life plays a role.

This film is all about communication and how language impacts how we live life, so by conveying this message through the use of aliens invading earth (a cliche narrative choice with Sci Fi) Villeneuve is risking being ordinary, but becomes an original, imaginative filmmaker in the process.\n\nThe film has excellent performances from Amy Adama and Jeremy Renner, alongside it's beautiful cinematography and soundtrack shot by Bradford Young and composed by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson respectively. The incredible screenplay via Eric Heisserer puts the cherry on top. An all round complete picture.\n\nThe film has many deep meanings which would suggest multiple viewings are essential in understanding the films complete idea, but Arrival is an underrated gem in my opinion and highlights Villeneuve's status as one of Hollywood's prominent directors working today. \n\nA superb film.\n\n\u2018Despite knowing the journey... and where it leads... I embrace it... and I welcome every moment of it.' - Louise",

Adams is good in the lead role, although I still view her best leading work as choosing good roles rather than driving a film forward. The same goes for Renner and Whittaker. Stuhlbarg shows his range in a grave departure from A Serious Man, although his character is quite simple. The drama unfolds with a tranquilising, captivating stillness provoking profound reflection. The story's beauty transcends the science fiction genre as a meditation on moral dilemma while never forgetting its roots. I have never witnessed a film that so effortlessly weaves multiple areas and surfaces in a fantastical yet somehow bare manner. The only reason that this is not five stars is that characters outside of Renner and Adams are quite uninteresting.",

Also, I would say the end disappointed me a bit because it was really complicated and I'm not sure I understand everything. On the other hand, the end solves a problem that I found during the movie. Indeed, maybe you'll find the movie chaotic with his timeline, but the end explains everything. Now, the movie has great points too, not just bad. I would say that it goes in a better direction than a lot of sci-fi movie with this \"Aliens psychology\" sort of thing and it exploit a much different and deep subject into the alien touch. Also, the images a pretty good. I really liked the dark environment and the mist everywhere, it was visually well-done.

What annoyed me was the writing style ala 90s Hollywood, which is apparent the first 10 minutes - how Louise got selected to try to communicate with the aliens, the conversation with the physicist in the helicopter, later the attitude of stubborn colonels undermining the scientist's work, the bad bad Chinese army and cliche predictable romantic subplot. Near the end of the movie we find out that the ill daughter flashbacks are actually the future visions which is fine but the fact we never find out what's the big thread that aliens need human help in 3000 years, is quite a letdown. The acting is nothing to write home about. 5/10 because I see how it can give some people a little bit to think about and it somehow resembles the vibe of \"Annihilation\", a bit newer and better movie.",

Forest Whitaker (Plays: Colonel Weber) was also amazing, very cool performance that surprised me. Jeremy Renner's character (Ian Donnelly) was so useless, even the character said that in one of the scenes, he said that he is nothing without Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and she is the one who is doing everything.\n\nThe directing was so amazing wasn't surprised that Denis Villeneuve was nominated for an Oscar. \n\nThe cinematography and colors were so amazing, especially that shot when we first see the aliens aircraft, the incredible long take encompassing the entire area with the fog surrounding it, loved it so much. One thing that grabbed my attention is the whole \"color tone\", the off white-ish color that is dark, gives u that feeling of fear, feeling of confusion of why these aliens are here, it was just amazing and really loved it so much.\n\nThe music was so cool, it builds a lot of emotions inside of you.\n\nthe production design was so beautiful and simple, deserved an Oscar nomination.\n\nThe sound editing and sound mixing were two things that were really powerful and although I didn't watch that movie on the big screen with all the sound effects that are in the theatre, but it was still a thing that was so amazing and grabbed my attention.\n\nArrival is a movie that is not the best but also not the worst, the 3rd act or to be specific; the ending makes you want to watch the movie again and makes you think about the movie from its begging. A great story with a great directing, cinematography and production design but felt like it could've been way better but \nFor sure recommend it.\n\nMy rating is: 8/10",

Highly grounded in sci-fi is what makes this one of my favourite films.\n\nRewatched it for the first, after 3 years. Remember vividly a lot of stuffs, one the few movies I used to constantly think about 3 years ago. Script is a masterpiece, way to tell that story in that way, beautiful. The concept of time travel seen in a new light.\n\nThe soundtrack is addicting, was listening to it out loud and my mother told me to stop it because it felt like 'someone was dieing', I replied HannaH.\n\nThe cinematography of that first scene of spaceship was gorgeous. Many social commentary about conspiracy theory, majority of them were correct as we can see from pandemic. I actually gained a lot of respect for linguistics, always thought of it as a useless study area but boy was I wrong.\n\nRewatching it, caught many foreshadowing. The movie literally says everything at the beginning.\n\nLoved the themes, her taking the decision of have that child. Its not about the goodbyes but the memories we make before the goodbyes. She would rather find & lost than never get it. The parallelism with one the heptapods(alien) dieing yet the other one not caring because their time isn't linear, they could go back in memory.\n\nScript was smart to have that Chinese official scene, many will say it was plot convenience but I have head canon of her later telling the Chinese official to tell her everything later on, hence he had a line 'I don't know how your brain/memory works'\n\nThe movie did answer why aliens came but it wasn't concerned with that,  it was more about humanity and their perspective & memories. This is CINEMA.\n\nType of movie I will end and sleep on thinking about it. The calm and eerie feeling filled me after the credits.",

I will always cry at the end of this film, because it's also about a woman and her decision to move forward with a difficult decision, even if she knows the consequences of it, which is so deeply human and powerfully set with the backdrop of sci-fi.",

It's stunning. The performances especially Amy Adam's performance. Don't go into the film excepting big laser battles and action because this is a slow-paced film. That's one little criticism I have with this film. It's a little slow. Also, the plot for some people may confuse people. It requires a second viewing upon first viewing. It took me a while to think about this review. Also, I can't stress enough how much this film reminds me of Shutter Island. I mean come on! They both use the same song \"On the Nature of Daylight\". The plots both seem familiar to each other. But hey, that's just my opinion. Overall, Arrival is a wonderfully directed film, with a great cast, and stunning production design. It's also a film that plays with our minds. And in my opinion, it succeeds at that.",

It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and they do an amazing job at keeping your attention through the movie. I love seeing actors from big-budget blockbusters getting into new things that they normally don't do it shows they are still amazing actors. I thought that Amy Adams was brilliant in this movie she has so much emotion through the movie. The cinematography was amazing and the sound design I thought was amazing too. I thought that everything in this movie is amazing, the editing, and the script are very good too. I love the way they used the sci-fi elements in the movie combining what we love about that and film making to make a masterpiece. They do a good job at flashbacks they don't bring you out of the story like other films will do, they do a clever job of making it flow. They also do a good job at handling the time travel aspects of the movie its not like other movies in the way they approached it I thought they did an amazing job at it.

The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (\"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned\"). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully.",

This movie kind of loses its true purpose in terms of telling main focus of the story, the first and second act is mainly telling about the strange object and living form that currently visiting mankind but the third act becomes more like a personal discovery for our main character played by Amy Adams, so although the final act for me is a little bit loose on its main setup this movie still a sold for me both from its looks and story.",

It is how the images are used, and the many little details that support the overall tone and emotions, letting you feel what our protagonists feel, and playing with your emotions in a way you wouldn`t expect - making this an absolute great watch.\nRecommendation: evade spoilers before you see it.",

I feel sorry for those who call it boring because, if you truly were bored, you either didn't understand it, you have a short attention span and can only focus long enough to see movement and shiny things, or you have no feelings. Either way, you are disadvantaged and the poorer for missing out on appreciating one of the most profound films ever produced. Why is it a good film? First, there are no films that defy being categorized like this one. Sure, it's called a science fiction but, honestly, its way more than that.  In terms of a genre, it's actually a combination of a science fiction with squid monsters, an intellectual study on communication and how it might affect your thoughts and actions, an exploration into the nature of time and its perception, a commentary on human behavior and the state of mankind such as man's tendency to jump to conclusions and make rash decisions, a mystery to be solved, a romance, a story of great grief and loss and, finally and most importantly, a bitter sweet statement on the value and beauty of life, all life, even life that doesn't last that, in the end, includes everyone's life.  Secondly, Arrival does all of these things very well and weaves each element together seamlessly into something beautiful and thought provoking.  It makes a statement like a philosopher.  Like a great poem or piece of art, it forces one to think, to wonder, to feel, to understand love, to feel grief and loss, to ponder what is and what is important.  I'm richer for having seen it and I give credit to those who achieved it.  I can't believe they were able to do it and to do it so well.",

The Arrival parts from a premise of a friendly first contact between aliens and humans, when humans tries to develop a communication with the Heptapods.\nOne of the things that I have admired in this movie was its atmosphere, the way the movie makes you feel immersed, the way that the events happen, the way humanity reacts from an alien visit from the movie tries hard to make a realistic scenario and succesfully achieves it! Since the scene where Dr. Louise Banks see the news from a televion and the first time she sees the alien spaceship. The movie, once again, succesfully makes you feel immersed and uncomfortable, it makes you ask to yourself: Who are they? And what do they want?\nWhen comes the scene which Louise and Ian are learning how to make contact with them I though that was fair. Although some linguistics affirms that one of their techniques was not one of the best, it felt realistic. More realistic parting from the assumption that the Heptapods had no difficulties in understanding them.\nOne of the things, I can't consider if it's a con or not, but the movie struggles to be a realistic movie, from the alien visit to including the political scenario to the movie, but in the movie China and Russia are considered the most important countries of the planet, \"each step China takes, other 12 nations will follow\". And constant references of the Venezuela were made on the movie. That part actually wrapped my stomach, no country in the planet, even USA does not have this power, I've noticed that this part tried hard to make a propaganda for their political view, that didn't fit well in the movie. Needless to say.\nOne of the things that caught my attention too was the camera angles, the movie began with the camera aiming at the ceiling and slowly pointing the camera to the scenario, the movie began and finished with this camera animation(this camera movement was repeated some times throughout the movie).\nThe Arrival has its pros and flaws, I'll give it 4/5, the only part of the movie I didn't like was that forced political view propaganda, ignoring that, was a pleasant experience.",

In developing the social and geopolitical implications of the alien's arrival while simplifying the actual linguistic import of the source material, the film deepens the emotional resonance of the story beyond the original text's meticulous exploration of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis; instead, here the arrival of extreme alterity could just as well stand for the need to address the exigency of unthinkable climate change (incomprehensible yet demanding response) as it does the appearance of extra terrestrials. In this sense, the movie is also ultimately far more hopeful than the novella: As in the latter, we may never fully be able to communicate with the wholly Other, understanding their motives or plans, but here we can still at least learn to speak and listen to one another.",

But it subverted all the conventions of a typical sci-fi flick in leaving a message so beautifully surreal yet still so highly relevant to our global community. Adams (and even Renner) are amazing as always, though it is Villeneuve who is at the peak of his craft, masterfully going back and forth in between the flashbacks and Louise's present in such an emotionally impactful way. This is definitely a movie that will always be up there for me! (credits to Max Richter as well for that final song which is just pure gold)\n\nI must add though, that there definitely are some flaws. The story isn't quite complete, and the characters of Renner, Whittaker and Stuhlbarg feel unnecessary, which wastes such high talent. Ultimately, however, this is not the movie's focus, and is something that can be easily overlooked.",

But Villeneuve takes Chiang's work a step further by taking audiences on an emotional thrill ride, that deals with issues of diplomacy, motherhood, love, loss, science, linguistics, and the dynamics of human interaction in a seamless and intelligent way.

I could not get that film out of my mind for months and I don't know if I can ever watch PRISONERS again. That said... I don't know what I'm feeling after watching THE ARRIVAL. THE ARRIVAL has shaken me to tears and I don't know why.. maybe the answer will come to me in a few days... maybe it never will... maybe someone on Facebook can help explain what I'm feeling. \n      However, I am a huge fan of Mr. Villeneuve's work. For me, He so carefully crafts the tone of a film that you have no choice but to be hugely affected by it whether that reaction is positive or negative and to me that is what great art is all about. I'm surprised that I still have not seen his sequel to the original Blade Runner. I think I'm a little afraid to see it.. his films make me feel and think so much that I find them a bit overwhelming, but I have a great admiration for his talent!",

Or, if not real, then at the very least 'plausible'.\n\nOut of all the science fiction movies I've watched over the years, Arrival is the only one to evoke any sense of actual believability. If an alien species were to visit earth, the events portrayed in Arrival are almost exactly how I believe things would actually transpire.\n\nAll of the performances are fantastic, but Amy Adams really steals the show. Her portrayal of Louise Banks is engrossing and, again, believable. Jeremy Renner does a great job as well, but he shares so much screen time with Adams that his performance is very much understated.\n\nI loved the sound direction for this film. I loved the sounds the aliens made, and I loved the distorted sensation that the characters were subjected to in their presence. The musical score is spot-on, as well. Tense, but not overbearing.\n\nThe aliens themselves were exactly how I would imagine aliens would actually appear: not human-like at all but, instead, strange and otherworldly and in complete defiance of anything we have ever seen.\n\nI really enjoyed the plot of Arrival. I'm very interested in the concept of time and the flow of time and everything that it entails. The idea of an alien language being able to manipulate the flow of time is - to me - completely unique and unlike anything I'd seen or read in science fiction before. The use of flashbacks, and the eventual reveal of them being flash-forwards, was executed very well.\n\nArrival is one of the best science fiction films I've ever seen. It is smart, beautiful, dramatic, and thought-provoking... everything you could ask for in a movie.\n\nIf you could see your entire life, from start to finish, would you change anything?",

Amy Adams & Jeremy Renner create spectacular performances as their characters and if they didn't, they deserve at least an Oscar nomination.

It transcends the genre, over its storyline, evolving into something much greater than what its title, box art, posters, trailers, or any marketing materials could possibly convey. Its storyline starts out a tense first-contact-with-aliens affair, but unravels into something intricate, challenging, delicate, and utterly emotionally and intellectually compelling.\n\nSimply put: Every aspect of this movie is impeccable. As a whole composition, Villeneuve has achieved near-perfection.\n\nI could fawn over this story's plotline forever, but it's too special to reveal much through analysis. Trust me: It's genius. It's the movie I've basically always wanted, executed brilliantly.\n\nThe two obvious stars here are Amy Adams's performance and Denis Villeneuve's direction. Adams's performance has been much-lauded, but Villeneuve's direction cannot garner enough praise.\n\nDirection is obviously outstanding. Scenes are expertly crafted to give the audience the best-possible perspective coming from the viewpoint of the central protagonist: Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams, who got robbed of her Oscar for this performance). This is so crucial: Scenes which are disorienting for Dr. Banks are disorienting on-screen; we feel the chaos surrounding; we feel her intimate confusion. Not only does this make us empathize with her character, but, in the movie, she is an expert linguist and brilliant person. This makes us, the audience, feel intelligent. For such an intelligent film, it's a real treat.\n\nPacing is excellent. It starts out slow and tense, but absolutely never boring. It ramps up precisely before it needs to, steadily building up to a crescendo that's so magnificent, detailing it in praise would be close to spoiling it.\n\nThe film's bleak and minimalistic aesthetic is outstanding, with sparse set pieces and dark, muted, earthy color tones both complimenting and focusing on the aliens and their spacecraft-a work of sci-fi minimalistic perfection. It's the glorious antithesis of oversaturated Michale Bay schlock (in almost every regard, really.)\n\nThe sound design, too, is brilliant. It's subtle, but captivating. J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's musical score perfectly compliments the aesthetic and narrative. It serves as neither background noise nor show-stealer. The non-musical sound design, however, is often breathtaking. It is brought into and out of focus with surgical precision, maintaining sublime quality throughous. But when it's in the spotlight, it elevates this movie, becoming one of the defining traits that make this one of the greatest sci-fi films ever.\n\nMy only minor complaint is backhanded praise: that this film deserves to be longer. It could easily work with an extra 30 minutes instead of having less than 2 hours of runtime. I'm loathe to imagine what might have been cut by studio executives, but relish the idea of a Director's Extended Cut. \n\nWhen I think about other minor complaints (\"this one scene, that other scene, was this a plot hole or sloppy writing?\") that popped into my head at one point or another, after digesting the film, in retrospect, every single one made sense. No other science-fiction film has required me to suspend my disbelief so little.\n\nThis film is nearly perfect. And I only say that to hedge my bet, because no imperfections come to mind. This film was a revelation. It was transcendental, monumental, and hopefully genre-defining.\n\nThe awesome plotline, pacing, aesthetic,  sound design, and acting (especially by Adams) are all precisely put together by Villeneuve to craft a cinematic art piece that is both immensely intellectually and emotionally compelling. It is a masterpiece, easily one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time.",

The idea is because Amy Adams learns the alien language, she is able to experience time in a non-linear way (not arranged in a straight line). Add to that a subplot of Amy Adams flashbacks of her deceased daughter and the laughable concept that \"Sudan\" the African shithole is mentioned alongside super powers of China and Russia in the supposed retaliation against the perceived Alien threat (the Aliens actually need help to avoid extinction in the future). All in all a very boring movie. Amy Adams/ Jeremy Renner combination works well though.",

            "content": "- Arrival takes you out of this world and brings you home. -\n\nAfter watching Arrival with my work boyfriend Ben, we had to go outside and have a smoke - and I don't even smoke.\n\nThis is one of the most intense, emotionally draining and sublime movies I have seen in YEARS. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario) excelled in making a film, not just about aliens, but the human desire to connect. It is fascinatingly complicated to explain, but this is what I would compare it to:\n\nIt's like watching a YouTube video that is narrated by a scientist as they describe how infinite space and time is and how fleeting our lives are - all whilst the most beautiful score plays in the background. I slowly fell in love with aliens and Amy Adams (Julie and Julia) and by the end of it, I questioned everything about my own existence.\n\nI can only give a short synopsis because I don't want to reveal any major spoilers.  Here is what you need to know:\n\nLouise (Amy Adams) is a linguistics professor who has spent her entire life studying communication. She knows about a billion different languages (don't quote me on that, it's probably more like 40). In the opening scenes of Arrival, 12 alien spaceships land all over the world and Louise is called upon to communicate with the one that landed in America. What happens next is a space roller coaster of emotion, science, math and language.\n\nThat's about all I can tell you about the plot. Not because I am lazy, but because I want you to experience what I did - going into a movie you know very little about.\n\nSo instead, I will tell you about the rest of my evening as we tried to make sense of what we'd just seen.\n\nBen and I sat on the bench outside the theater with our legs folded.  We gushed with mutual revelations of \"Oh god I didn't even pick up on that.\"\n\nBen asked me \"How on Earth (pun intended) are you going to review this?\" I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"maybe I will write it in the symbols that the aliens used to communicate with humans, but then I realized I am not a linguistics expert or an alien, so that idea was quickly abandoned.\n\nHowever, I feel that I am an expert in spotting talent and Amy Adams has been on my radar for awhile now. We discussed how I thought she was a great actress but the characters she's played in the past have annoyed the living crap out of me. But there was no such annoyance in sight with her portrayal of Louise in Arrival. Adams plays her exquisitely.\n\nThere is no dramatic speech about \"this is our Independence Day.\" She doesn't scream and cry that the world is ending. Adams subtly and superbly plays a woman who is hiding a secret but doesn't know it. Adams is so good in fact, she had me singing \"somebody is getting an Oscar nomination\" all the way to my car.\n\nThe last thing I did with my evening was call my mum, because this movie makes you want to call your family. If you don't have a family, then it will make you call your friends. If you don't have friends, then it will make you search the skies for aliens to talk to.\n\nWhy? Because this epic Sci-Fi film is not really about the threat of aliens, it is about communication. It is about understanding each other and our differences. We are all asking the questions, do you hear me? Do you see me? Does what I am saying matter to you?\n\nAfter watching Arrival, it was not a question of are we alone in the universe, it was a question of, why would we want to be? And if there is ever a day when extraterrestrials come down to Earth, if I'm still alive, then I will be the first to shake their hand - or tentacle - or whatever.\n\nAs famous philosopher Paulo Freire once said - \"only through communication can human life hold meaning\". Therefore isn't the meaning of life found through how we connect with each other, through love and understanding? (Woah, wait...did I just discover the meaning of life?)\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://narrativemuse.co/movies/arrival, and was written by Jules Raynes.

The real main character of the film is the Sappir-Whorf hypothesis which states that how we think is informed by our language. In the film one of the ways a nation tried to teach the aliens language is through the use of Shogi which is a Chess like game. If the aliens are only taught words related to a competitive game then they can only describe things in terms of competition. As the film puts it \"Give them a hammer and everything is a nail\" It makes the audience consider how language has effected our perspective and how we might be limited by it. What would a language look like if it had no limits and caused our perspective to shift in the direction of infinity? Words are intended to represent concepts, causality is a concept at the root of making predictions, if we understood causality perfectly and codified that understanding into language then we could accurately make predictions. In the film the aliens possess such a language and as a result predict the future.",

But after I learned the twist towards the end from the first time, and watched it again for the 2nd time, everything became crystal clear, which finally allowed me to appreciate the brilliance in the way the director/writers chose to do the story telling. It is a pretty risky choice from commercial success stand point. But I have to applaud those involved to stick with the artistic choice to make this film.

Arrival is probably one of my least favorite movies of 2016, which I haven't watched until now. Here is my non-spoiler review of Arrival.\n\n9/10 points go to the ACTING category. Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forrest Whitaker, and friends give great performances. Adams makes a convincing character who's name I have already forgotten. Renner plays Ian, who is the only reason there is one point off from this category. He literally gives a stupid and idiotic delivery for his last line of the film. I won't say it, as it is a spoiler to the end.\n\n4/15 points goes to the WRITING category. The story is basic. Weird aliens come to Earth, people want to know what they are, and Amy Adams is seeing stuff she can't explain. The first 30 minutes of the film and any sequence with the aliens is amazing. The rest is pretty bad. History is determined, but Adams doesn't know what to do/say. Adams is seeing stuff, but doesn't even care about what it is. There are even parts where it seems like present and unknown tense are coming together. The story is not written to well.\n\n10/10 points go to the VISUAL EFFECTS category. The aliens look real, and so do the shells. No problems here like about everything else.\n\n4/10 points go to the CHARACTERS category. The characters are basic. We get little development from them. There is a tiny bit of development for Adams and Ian, but I won't tell you because it is a spoiler. Many people can only be called \"people who scream and complain a lot\", which is pretty basic.\n\n2/5 points go to the DEVELOPMENT category. There is a bit of a conflict and a bit of a compromise. There is a bit of an answer to a question that doesn't get answered. There are a lot of plot holes. This movie also, as I previously said, has a bit of character development which is a spoiler.\n\n2/5 points go to the ORIGINAL MUSIC SCORE category. The score is basic, it is very noticeable most of the time, and that is a bad thing. I didn't find the score at all or even a bit interesting. \n\n3/5 points go to the DESIGN category. The design in a bit cool I guess. It is a bit original and is a bit lame at the same time. It is pretty dark sometimes, and I don't like that. I like the movie's way of showing that things are a bit rushed within the way that things are unorganized. I don't know if that was or wasn't untended by the director.\n\n10/10 points go to the DIRECTION category. Everything that seems planned is done well. Most of the delivery is pretty good. Yeah. That's about all I have to say about the direction of this movie. Nothing stands out.\n\n4/10 points go to the VISION AND SOUND QUALITY category. You can barely hear the actors for most of the movie. The movie is very dark for many scenes which is pretty bad. Some of the scenes do look good. The editing is also pretty bad for most of the film's random vision scenes that Adams is having.\n\n7/20 points go to the MY OVERALL CONSENSUS category. The film is boring, seems unorganized, and overall, I thought it was pretty bad.\n\nScore: 63%\nGrade: D-",

It took a while this year! Gosh, as soon as this movie arrives it begs to be praised and saying what makes it good is as easy as understanding quantum physics. First of all, you have to understand that, more than anything, this is a character study. No, it's not a movie about aliens, an invasion, or even a conflict between beings from outer space and humans. It's primarily about a character and her inner conflict and psyche. We're start to finish with Louise to learn of what she makes of what's happening around her and how that is changing her. This is done beautifully in Sicario and in that sense it seems pretty similar the way we follow Kate (from Sicario) and Louise, making sure that we're constantly enthralled in order to understand them. This is done by shifting a little bit of the attention from what surrounds Louise to her expression and by having a performance to match it. No surprise there, but Amy Adams just blows it out of the park giving a subtle and realistic performance that is absolutely translucent to the character's inner state. Many haven't noticed, but Amy is the new Leo, having 5 nominations and no win but this season, whether with this one or Nocturnal Animals, I believe she has a good shot of getting that gold! Furthermore, this film not only has a fantastically substantiated script and plot, but also has the technical side to support it: the cinematography is rich and very identifiable, the sound design is well thought out and the aliens and ship's design is marvellous. The music is also close to perfection as J\u00f3hannsson accentuates and gives even more meaning to important moments, and keeps quiet when he should. I also like that this movie takes such a fresh approach to the genre, as it manages to make a film about a translator actually damn gripping! I'm a fan of this trend of intellectual astute sci-fi movies that is being developed recently. And like Interstellar, this one comes with an even better grounded and believable twist.  The end gives meaning to the film, making it more than just about some aliens, but about communication, loss and the way we conceive time. Never this year have I felt the need to see a film exactly after I saw it and Arrival is, undoubtedly, the best movie I saw this post-Oscar year. Please, if there's a movie to spend money on right now, this is it!",

I must say I love Amy Adams and will faithfully watch any movie she's in start to finish as I'm very fond of her delicate, thoughtful style.

I don't care much for time travel stories. This one got into some territory that was a bit in the vein of Interstellar. Interesting that a lot of folks did not like Interstellar which was actually based on real scientific theory. Arrival is more in line with New Age thought. It's interesting experiencing one's future death. The acting was very convincing but I did not care for the constant scenic darkness and one of my pet peeves, continual whispered dialogue. They went a bit over the top creating a foreboding, depressive mood. The overall production seemed low budget, perhaps the need for dark, blurry scenes and much of the dramatic action in a tent. The arc of the climax seemed a lot like Interstellar, seeing the future vs. time dilation, the future phone conversation vs. the pocket watch and quantum entanglement, both saving the day. As all good stories the guy got the girl in the end.",

It's a movie about the power of humanity and our need to overcome divisive rhetoric and fear in order to survive. It's especially poignant in the current U.S. political climate, when it's not difficult to imagine a historically significant event bringing us to the edge of catastrophe.\n\nIt's hard to find fault in any aspect of this movie, so instead, I'll stick to what works well. Amy Adams' initially flat performance is incredibly nuanced - don't disregard her as a contender for Best Actress. The sound mixing and score are beautifully handled, creating a space for the movie to breath and feel and exist without shoving emotions down the audience's throat. The cinematography is stunning, aided by beautiful scenery and near-flawless visual effects.\n\nFinally, screenwriter Eric Heisserer (previously wasted on projects like The Thing and Final Destination 5) handles the source material from the sci-fi short story \"Story of Your Life\" with aplomb. I'm seeking out an original copy of the story now, to see how much he adapted, and how much was just not screwing it up (a real danger in Hollywood these days, no matter the quality of the source).\n\nI'm on the edge of my seat eager for the Academy Award nominations (three days!) to see how many Arrival pulls in. Simultaneously, it won't surprise me if this low-budget, indie film is too nuanced to get the recognition it deserves. Never fear - I may not be the Academy or Roger Ebert, but this movie has my full endorsement.\n\nArrival is easily one of my favorite movies in a long time.

At the end I was worried that the plot was going full Interstellar, but they actually pulled it off and made it mostly make sense.

They do a masterful job of building the tension before we see the ships and then before we see the aliens, but I would have preferred it had been a bit faster. In particular, the sequence where they go up the man lift the first time drags on for quite a bit.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this for anybody looking for a thoughtful sci-fi movie.",

            "content": "The Arrival of a Lifetime\n\nIn Denis Villeneuve's movie, Arrival, linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is the United States' last hope to prevent a catastrophic world war. Upon the arrival of 12 massive, foreign ships, the world becomes plagued with chaos and fear. Throughout this sci-fi, Inception-esc film, the unexpectant viewer is taken on a high-intensity, unpredictable, and yet, perfectly engineered rollercoaster of excitement and suspense. \n\nHowever, one cannot review this movie without mentioning the inspiration behind it: \"The Story of Your Life\". This is a short story novella written by Ted Chiang that is centered around language. Chiang's inspiration for this novella was the philosophical theory of free will. To incite further thoughts, Chiang poses the question, \"If you know what's going to happen, can you keep it from happening?\"   This century old ethical question is addressed in Chiang's novella. \n\n\nThis exciting production takes place in the barren plains of Montana, where professor of linguistics Louise Banks and her team are tasked with an urgent, classified assignment. She is asked to put to test her extensive knowledge and skills of language and translation in just a short period of time; that is, before other countries lose faith in each other and begin pointing their fingers. While diligently working to complete such an extensive task, professor Banks is afflicted by an unknown, futuristic paradigm of what language will entail one day. However, it becomes apparent that the extraterrestrials haven't come for any reason other than to save themselves. \n\nThis review, while not full of complete story lines and time frames, is in simple words, a spoiler. \n\nThe method the extraterrestrials use to save themselves is unexpected by most viewers. This large-scale theme is perfectly illustrated in a single scene. The scene commences with an unauthorized military man entering the alien ship and placing C4 within the chamber of communication. Without this knowledge, Dr. Banks and her associate, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), rush to the pod in attempt to decipher the alien language. As the C4 explosive is about to detonate, the alien sacrifices itself to preserve the life of Dr. Banks and Ian Donnelly. Ironically, however, Dr. Banks is the only person capable of deciphering, understanding, and later, teaching this completely foreign language. Even more so, it is precisely this language that will save the alien species from utter extinction by allowing those who know such language to see the future.  \n\nWith this ability to see into the future, the viewer finally comes to an understanding of the continuous, what-seem-to-be flashbacks troubling Dr. Banks. Indeed, such visions are not flashbacks by any sense of word; they are, in fact, the polar opposite: flash-forwards. Throughout the entirety of the movie, Dr. Banks develops a continuously growing knowledge of the alien language and, for that reason begins to see into the future, which contains glimpses of her current unborn daughter. \n\nThese reoccurring visions illustrate a deep sense of humility and maturity in Louise Banks. Knowing that her daughter is going to be born with a terminal illness, she happily accepts fate and looks forward to cherishing every moment with her future daughter. Beyond that, if this language allows for future knowledge, the extraterrestrials' knowledge is no confined to time. Simply put, they know their future. They know that C4 is going to explode and injure them. However, just like Louise Banks, they knowingly accept this fate. \n\nWith a language like this, what is the limit? When knowledge isn't limited to the bounds of time who's to say what can and cannot be accomplished? On the other side, are humans mature and moral enough to accept this almost all-empowering language? This also alludes to Ted Chiang's novella and the inspiration behind it. Exists free will? If so, can one prevent the known future? All of these are questions that rise from this movie. \n\nBecause of these \"flash-forwards\", Arrival takes on this Inception-like plot twist at the end. It is truly intriguing. Inception was a dream within a dream, induced by a particular party of interest, and used to influence a man's decision for the party's own benefit. Likewise, Arrival is a flash-forward, revealed by the extraterrestrials to Dr. Banks for their own interest. The reason the aliens show her these \"flash-forwards\" is to merely convince her to learn their language and therefore, be the architect of their future salvation. \n\nRegardless of comparisons, this was a perfectly executed film. How often does one witness a professor of linguistics as a \"save-the-day\", hero type character in a movie? On top of that, the portrayal of genuine, pleasant aliens is a scarce sight in today's world. Although their actions reflected self-indulged motives, the extraterrestrials came to give humanity a tool: their language. \n\nWhile completely enthralled by this film, certain questions came to mind. What happens to humanity over the next 3000 years, prior to the saving of these aliens? How does their language affect modern society and technology? What was so strong as to threaten the existence of these advanced extraterrestrials 3000 years from the time of the film? Of course, being a science fiction enthusiast, the idea of a sequel, prequel, or anything in-between this movie's timeline is captivating.     \n\nAll in all, this brilliant depiction of extraterrestrials and linguistics merged together forms what is now one of the most authentic, captivating films within the science fiction genre. In a single word, brilliant. This movie was nothing short of brilliance. The original integration of a linguist savior for an alien species is captivating, exciting, and refreshing.",

What if you could know the past, present, and future? \"If you could see your life from start to finish, would you change things?\" said Dr. Louise Banks, main character played by Amy Adams in the movie \"Arrival\" \nThe movie is extremely well put together and makes one think deeply about what is going on in movie as well as that their life means to them. Dr. Banks made the discovery that the language of those arrived does not represent sound or speech like the languages we know today but rather meaning and complete thoughts. She said \"When you learn it you begin to perceive time as they do. \n\"I used to think this (speaking of birth) was the beginning of your story. Memory is a strange thing, It doesn't work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time, by its order. I remember moments in the middle. And this was the end. But now i'm not so sure i believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrived.\" \nThe movie has an extremely deep message. As Louise learns the language of the heptapods, she, like them, begins to perceive time as all at once, knowing past, present and future. She uses this ability to provoke our finite minds into contemplating the idea of seeing our lives from start to finish and if we would change things. It is implied that many of us would indeed change some aspect of our lives if we were to know the big picture, thus, teaching us to be wise in our decisions and relationships to not have any regrets. \n4.5 stars because the acting was semi good in the beginning but improved throughout the movie.",

It amazes me the abilities that Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) has in the film and her discovery of why this is all happening across the world.

I appreciated that the story focused on that aspect instead of some fight with the other beings. The fact that we never know what the aliens or military members with Adams and Renner would do, made for some great tense scenes. There's a particular one with a ticking bomb that stood out as excellent. Adams shines above everything else with one of the best performances of her career. She portrays her desperation to understand these creatures, in the midst of some haunting visions, expertly. She and Renner played off each other well. There are some pacing issues, as things moved at a crawl in a few of the scenes towards the middle, but it picks up with a great ending.

Mysterious floating monoliths appear around the world and linguist Amy Adams, with help of physicist Jeremy Renner, work with the government to try and communicate with the aliens amid global fears and international political tensions. This story is more \"Close Encounters\" and \"Contact\" than \"Independence Day\" or \"War of the Worlds,\" where the main focus of the story is on how to communicate with the aliens, while reassuring the military brass, primarily Forrest Whittaker, that everything is okay and they don't have to attack. This tension of whether they can successfully communicate and avert a conflict with this new species (and whether other countries around the world might tip off an interstellar as well) makes for good ticking time bomb of dramatic tension, but it's really Adams who give the film an emotional human center, desperately wanting to connect with to these advances creatures, while at the same time is haunted by visions of her daughter. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who's next project was the new Blade Runner film, brings a strong visual style to the proceeding, but never in a way that is distracting to the story or style for the sake of style. My only complaint about the film is that it does move at a rather glacial pace, though in the end, the film does deliver with a terrific mind-bending of an ending, that makes the wait well worth it. Overall, \"Arrival\" is not a film for anyone wanting slam-bang science fiction, but is great if you're in the mood for something along the lines of \"Solaris\" or \"Moon.\"",

It's not as predictable as a lot of other mainstream movies; they give you just enough plot points and knowledge to follow a thread but not enough to draw all-telling solid conclusions (most of the time). The only major thing I had an issue with was:\n**Warning: major spoiler ahead!**\nThe fact that Ian left Louise over something so petty!\nI say 'petty' rightfully because this is an advanced scientist who has openly communicated with aliens, defied gravity, and knows that Louise can see the future (because obviously you don't just shield someone from a bullet while you listen to them speak Mandarin and save the world without questioning their actions later). \nHe is this accepting of everything around him but yet he simply can't accept that his daughter will die early of cancer? We all die in the end- does that make life pointless or does it free us to enjoy what we have? If our lives were already written out would that make our actions hollow or valuable experiences we should really give ourselves into?\nIt really surprised me that a man of his understanding, acceptance, and intelligence left Louise over the pain of knowing his daughter will die early of cancer- and that Louise chose to have her anyways.\nMost parents wouldn't trade anything in the world for even a minute of their child's life- would he have rather not had her at all than get to enjoy her beautiful life and fill his heart with love for her? \nI mean I get his divorce from her is used as a plot device to 1. Keep the pieces of the story from coming together too quickly, and 2. To demonstrate to the audience that things like the probability/knowing of death and heart break shouldn't keep us from following our hearts. \nBUT STILL. It pisses me off. I hate that such a seemingly deep character made such a shallow choice. Hannah always has been, and always will be theirs. Nothing in the world could've ever changed that- dead or alive, she always belonged to them. Before she had even existed she was theirs. \ne.g.\nI wouldn't say I made the wrong choice picking my dog out as a puppy if I knew he was going to die of a degenerative disease 13 years later. I love him more than I can handle, and he will always hold a piece of my heart. Forever. No dog I would've picked out would live for eternity- and would I sacrifice the love I have for him specifically and the life he's lead for the sake of avoiding heartbreak? Never. \nYou can't fight life- you can only embrace it and accept it for what it is.",

            "content": "You should not watch Arrival, because everything you need to know about the movie is right on the cover: Amy Adams staring solemnly into the distance, while Jeremy Renner gazes longingly. Oh yeah there's aliens that apparently deserve better placement than the black guy from Battleship Earth (arguably a better alien in that movie than the Cthulhu Heptapod things were in this one.)  \n\nWhat makes this movie terrible, and not just able to be avoided unless you need some background noise for Netflix and Chill, is that your primal lizard brain really wants to like it.  The visuals are on fleek, and the score is one of those maudlin pastoral dirges that make you want to go to bed and die.  Speaking of dying, Amy Adams' kid dies.  That's not a spoiler because that's literally how the movie opens.  Just throws it right out there on the Thanksgiving dinner table.    It's gonna be a real depressing 2 hours, and don't you regret not clicking on the Avengers instead because, of course, now SHE wants to see what happens since dying children are like glue traps for millennial chicks and you're too invested at this point.\n\nAs for the rest of the synopsis, there are these aliens that come to earth in twelve of those old native american grind stones that you had to smash corn with when your 6th grade class visited that pioneer village, and they speak only in coffee stains.  Swear to God you're going to watch it not believing me and then go, \"Oh damn, he wasn't kidding like when he said Eleven dies in Stranger Things 2.\"  Evidently these coffee stains allow you to see the future ONLY IF YOU ARE AMY ADAMS despite the fact that Jeremy Renner did just as much work and actually cracked the fact that the only way to save the world was to embrace this clumsy allegory for Globalism.  Where's your pay gap now, ladies?\n\nSo Amy and Jeremy try to stop Forrest Whitaker from blowing up the grindstone squids despite the fact that one of the Heptapods says something in Caffeinese translates to \"Use Weapon\" and that's usually the time the aliens should have actually stepped back and thought, \"Oh hell, that was probably a really stupid thing to choose as our first words to a militarily developed native race in whose yard we happen to be parked illegally.\"  She eventually steals a phone and tells THE ONLY MILITARY GENERAL IN CHINA EVIDENTLY what his wife said right before she died and as they say in China, \"If you can remember what my wife told me on her death bed, then I have to call off my alien war.\"  So he tells future Amy Adams his personal phone number knowing that present day Amy Adams would then know it because when red headed white girls bust out fluent Mandarin, you suddenly learn everything about FTL Time Travel (which this claimed to be but absolutely wasn't).\n\nOh yeah, also also Amy Adams keeps going back and forth in time every time she reads what the aliens are saying like she's having photosensitive time-seizures.  It's not confusing however, just remember that every time you see her with her kid, that part of the movie is completely vestigial to the main story and cutting it out would actually make everyone feel better.\n\nSo the aliens take Amy Adams up into their ship, and basically lay out the whole plot of the movie in subtitles because the director of this movie spent way too much time reminding everyone who watches this movie that humans are flawed, and are capable of getting sick and dying at a young age.  Oh yeah, and she goes from knowing about 4 words in Coffee stain/Caffeinese/whatever to being able to carry on entire existential discussions with aliens capable of INTERPLANAR TRAVEL yet know dick about grammar and conjugation, and talk like they came from super advanced albeit somehow still REALLY into Frank Lloyd Wright squid world on a J1 Study Visa.  Whole thing is just silly.\n\nOh yeah, and instead of deciding not to have a child so as to prevent it from suffering a horrible death, and just explain it to Jeremy Renner who will believe her because she just made the aliens go away and those people probably would know stuff like that,  she voice-overs this whole thing about embracing the inevitable because as soon as Jeremy Renner admits that he loves her he also leans in and Whispers Joe Biden-style, \"I want to put a baby in you\", or \"let's make a baby,\" or something super appropriate for a pre-first date phase of courtship.  \n\nAnd then it literally ends.  And you're trying to conceal the genuine fury that Hollywood had the nerve to put a SCI-FI label on a Nicholas Sparks story.  What did the aliens eat?  What forms of government did they have on squid world?  Why did they talk in coffee circles?  what was the magic intelligent ink that they used to talk made of?  can you send me the PDF on how to learn that language so I can (trigger warning) Trump my friends who brag about knowing Tolkien Elvish.  These are the questions that should at least be teased with the hint of an answer if you're going to qualify as a legit science fiction film.  \n\nBut no.  All we learned about the aliens is they really like to see Amy Adams cry.",
