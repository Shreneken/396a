None the last I think its worth watching just for his fresh style and concept. The scrip is very good and funny until the last part when the director had to just find a way to end the movie. But once again, I think is worth watching for his originality.",

Michelle is a model and is writing a novel.  The three are connected: Edward and his world are found in the pages of Emma's comic book, Michelle's story is Edward's movie and Emma's story is Michelle's book.\n\nHad heaps of potential.  Very novel idea - the story-within-a-story-within-the-first-story - very Christopher Nolan-esque.  \n\nHowever, even from the beginning the movie doesn't really live up to its potential.  Only the Emma story was engaging.  Edward's story is mildly interesting but not exactly compelling viewing.  Michelle's story was pretty dull.\n\nMoreover, when the three stories are tied together it is in chaotic, random fashion.  The last few scenes feel clumsy and contrived, and the connection between the three stories is ultimately not used effectively.  This largely leaves you with three separate, independent stories.  So the novelty is wasted.\n\nOverall, not a total waste of time, but quite disappointing considering the movie's potential.",

            "content": "\"Inception\" meets \"The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys\" with a heaping helping of sex. This unrelenting, ADHD-edited \"film\" is an interesting visual experiment. Unfortunately, there's not much more to it. It critiques perceptions of beauty and authorial intent, but it hardly has anything new to say. As far as its satire goes, Pedro Morelli took every opportunity to make it as \"meta\" as possible but failed to make it more intellectually stimulating than \"Last Action Hero\". It is cartoony (maybe more-so in the live action segments) schlock that would appeal to fans of \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" (read: teenagers), but it is too explicit for that demographic. I guess that qualifies it as \"arthouse\". As extremely inconsistent and juvenile as it is, \"Zoom\" still manages to be more entertaining than any of the films I mentioned in this review.",

It's a lot to wrap your head around, that's for sure. But I don't think it was about the end result, but more about the ride that you go on. I've really liked Alison Pill since Scott Pilgrim, and this is a great role for her, she is super funny in it. Gael Garcia Bernal is a lot of fun playing Edward, an animated film director. Michelle's storyline (played by Mariana Ximenes) has the most tonal shifts and changes, since she is actually in the movie that Edward is making (and is writing the story of Alison Pill's character's life. Told you it's trippy.). But you can see the cinematography change depending on how Edward's movie is being filmed. Overall, this is really clever, and a pretty fun watch.",
