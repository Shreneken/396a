    "summary": "The true story of Pfc. Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), who won the Congressional Medal of Honor despite refusing to bear arms during WWII on religious grounds. Doss was drafted and ostracized by fellow soldiers for his pacifist stance but went on to earn respect and adoration for his bravery, selflessness and compassion after he risked his life -- without firing a shot -- to save 75 men in the Battle of Okinawa.",

            "content": "\"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a 2016 war/drama movie directed by Mel Gibson, based on the true story of Desmond Doss, a World War II medic who served during the Battle of Okinawa without ever carrying a weapon.\n\nOne of the strengths of this film is its powerful and emotional story. The movie follows Desmond Doss, a deeply religious man who is committed to serving his country but refuses to compromise his beliefs by carrying a weapon. Andrew Garfield delivers a strong performance as Doss, portraying his conviction and courage with sincerity and authenticity.\n\nThe movie's depiction of the Battle of Okinawa is harrowing and intense, with brutal and realistic depictions of combat that are not for the faint of heart. The cinematography is also impressive, with excellent use of light and shadow to create a sense of atmosphere and tension.\n\nThe film's direction by Mel Gibson is solid, with strong attention to detail and a willingness to depict the brutal reality of war. The musical score by Rupert Gregson-Williams is also a standout feature of the film, adding a sense of emotion and drama to the proceedings.\n\nHowever, one potential weakness of the film is its lack of nuance in its portrayal of the Japanese soldiers. While the movie doesn't shy away from depicting the brutality of war, it presents the Japanese soldiers as faceless and inhuman, without much insight into their motivations or perspectives.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a powerful and emotionally charged war/drama movie that is well worth watching. Its impressive performances, intense battle sequences, and strong direction make it a must-see for fans of the genre, although its lack of nuance in its portrayal of the enemy is worth noting.",

            "content": "O filme é ótimo e já assistir umas quatro vezes, quando o vi pela primeira vez, em 2017, não achei tão empolgante, pois parecia ser só mais um clichê de guerra, mas depois me surpreendi com algumas coisas que não tinha notado. Ele, no geral, contém uma boa direção e tem uma \"bonita\" fotografia com cenas de violência impressionantes  que mostram uma perspectiva bem real de uma guerra, no entanto, acaba pecando com algumas outras cenas. Essa obra vai fazê-lo questionar até onde o ser humano iria para defender suas convicções, onde, as perguntas: você arriscaria perder tudo aquilo que possui por elas? Incluindo sua própria vida? permanecerão na sua cabeça durante todo o abra.\n\nA guerra é um lugar que transforma homens em animais, corrompe o coração de todos os soldados e a única forma de sobrevivência é matando, essa é ideia que muitos tem, mas não para Doss que consegue ir à guerra apenas coma missão de salvar vidas, assim, o tema central da obra é a segunda guerra mundial, tendo como personagem principal esse jovem objetor de consciência. Nesse sentido, a obra começa com foco na vida cotidiana de Doss, antes dele se alistar no exército, no qual é apresentado o sonho do protagonista de ser médico e como seus princípios são fortemente baseados na sua fé cristã. \n\nDoss é sujeito peculiar e muito interessante, ele é sensível, fisicamente frágil e extremamente fiel aos seus princípios religiosos, no qual, chega a ser irônico pensá-lo como um soldado em uma guerra, principalmente indo por livre espontânea vontade. Quando isso acontece a primeira coisa que vem em mente é que ele irá, ou desistir com muita facilidade ou mudar suas convicções por causa do ambiente hostil em que se encontrará, mas é um grande engano e sua moralidade é a força que o faz persistir diante de todas as dificuldades que sofre. \n \nA promessa que jamais tocaria em armas é explicada quando, em um momento de sua vida, quase matou seu pai, pois não suportou mais presenciar agressões familiares contra sua mãe. Com esse princípio em mente, ele se alista ao exército com o intuito de ser médico e apenas salvar vidas no campo de batalha, não portando nenhuma arma. Essa é a peculiaridade da história desse herói que torna toda sua relação com a violência muito emocionante, pois você vai questionar bastante essa convicção, e como resposta, de maneira bem elaborada, o diretor vai mostrando os outros diversos episódios da vida de Doss que o faz crê nesse princípio antiviolência.\n \nNa segunda etapa do filme, existe o alistamento no exército e ele tem que resistir a várias injustiças em seu treinamento militar. Doss é enquadrado como louco por seus superiores, afim de tenta-lo expulsá-lo, é tido como covarde por não querer colocar uma arma em suas mãos, surrado por seus companheiros de alojamento e até julgado na corte marcial. Essas são verdadeiros testes as suas crenças, contudo, os enfrenta de forma emocionante todas as vezes, desse modo, apesar da maré contrária, ele permanece no exército, pois não há nada de errado em ser um objetor de consciência e seus direitos são previstos na constituição americana.\n \nTemos batalhas com imagens de corpos dilacerados em câmera lenta, sangue jorrando por todos os lados e a luz amarelada das explosões contrastando com a paisagem cinzenta. É nesse cenário que Doss mostra que sempre foi o homem mais corajoso de seu batalhão, trabalhando como medico entre as trincheiras e sendo guiado por sua fé, no qual, faz toda a diferença ao salvar 75 de seus amigos sem disparar um tiro. Nessa sequência de cenas de resgate, demonstram como Doss é incrível ao ser perseverante, mesmo sozinho, salvando todas aquelas pessoas e inclusive ajudou um dos seus inimigos, mostrando ser um real médico, que ajuda a todos sem preconceitos, dessa forma, esse filme presta uma homenagem mais do que merecida a um homem que salvou diversas vidas.\n\nEm resumo, o filme é extremamente bom, digno de suas indicações ao Oscar, inclusive pela atuação de Andrew Garfield que está ótima. Achei que ele iria deixar a desejar, mas só venho me surpreendendo com esse ator, seu carisma é muito bom, percorre toda a obra de maneira deslumbrante que te envolve completamente, tanto nas cenas de humor quanto nas tristes. Certamente o longa-metragem irá proporcionar muitos sentimentos e reflexões.",

I have watched many war movies and I would say this movie is a lot less about the aftermath of war(PTSD) and more about the violent and horrid aspects of war. This movie is based on a true story, Desmond T Doss's life being a soldier serving in the army of the United States. He joined the army never using a gun. He didn't believe in violence when war is violence. He was recognized as a hero as he saved many lives including \"enemies\" lives. Sound effects and overall decor has a great implication on the movie and the events. \nThis was a great watch, I recommend",

However, once you get to the second half with the military training is when the story really shines. The conflict between his morals of not wanting to hold a gun due to religious belief vs the army leads to some proper moving storytelling. All of this builds up to the final act, the war, and this is just absolutely exhilarating! The movie delivers on horrific and tense war scenes that blow a lot of other WWII movies out the water.\n\nMel Gibson delivered a phenomenal WWII movie with great battle scenes and Andrew Garfield gives a terrific performance as Desmond Doss.

Also, the diversity of fighting for the right to not fight but rather to save really drew me into the story and character. During the battle scenes, he stuck to his word and never picked up a gun or did harm to others. However, he tended to the other side's soldiers. This shows his empathy and bravery to risk his life for the well-being of others.

Not that the family/character study stuff is bad, far from it, it's beautifully filmed, even better acted and paints Doss as a very fascinating character that it's easy from the get go to identify with his wants to succeed against all catastrophic odds.\n\nJust that the first third does take time to get going with a pedestrian pace, the dialogue is corny (in fact, to me the dialogue is the least good thing about 'Hacksaw Ridge' in general and the element that rings true the least) and the sentimentality is laid too thick (this is also particularly true in the slightly underdeveloped romance).\n\nHowever this is made up for by the entertaining yet hard-hitting training scenes and in particular the truly jaw-droppingly brutal war/battle scenes that soar in nerve-shredding intensity and raw emotion, giving the first 30 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' a run for its money and perhaps making it tame in comparison (high praise for a film with one of the most gut-wrenching first 30 minutes on film, though to me the rest of the film isn't quite as good).\n\nThroughout 'Hacksaw Ridge' has exceptional production values, in particular the cinematography in the battle scenes, and Gibson directs like his life was depending on it. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score has the right amount of pulsating energy and nuance, and the sound effects in the war/battle scenes have a terrifying authenticity.\n\nFor a vast majority of the time, the story is very compelling and makes the most of mature and very easy to relate with themes. It has a wide range of emotional impact, being for the second half intensely powerful, much of the film being poignant, some of it sardonically amusing (without it being out of place) and also all of it inspirational. Rather than straying from the facts for dramatic license, Gibson is surprisingly respectful this time round.\n\nAndrew Garfield has yet to give a better performance than his astonishing turn here (though he is splendid too in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence'), and Gibson similarly brings the best out of Sam Worthington (often a charisma-free actor but here doubts were cast aside) and Vince Vaughn (at his sardonic best while also touchingly subdued, proof that he can be good if the material serves him all which too often in his career it hasn't but it does brilliantly here). Hugo Weaving is terrific, also giving some of his best work in some time. Teresa Palmer makes the most of her role.\n\nIn conclusion, a near-triumphant come-back. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

They both have glory as a fundament, but Hackshaw Ridge is about so much more, and there is no fiction to the plot. The basic is what pure faith and conviction really can achieve and how much strenght it can give to someone who possesses it, under the most extreme circumstances. The battle of Okinawa was a totally insane and desperate chaos, and it is not presented as anything else. Still, there are no animated characters and almost no exaggerated American heroes, except from Desmond Doss, who must have been one very special fellow, and who is brilliantly portrayed by Andrew Garfield. Naturally, in a Mel Gibson film, there are some last minute scenes, just for the case of the drama, and the religious factor is given a special place. The battle scenes are like the opening D-day scene in Ryan many times over, and in the final battle scenes the director just had to take it over the top, quite unnecessarily so, which is the biggest minus. This sadly goes beyond the otherwise well balanced intention in the film. Too rarely are the cinematographical factors highlighted in film reviews, but this film received Academy Awards for both best film editing and sound mixing, and was nominated for several other categories, including best picture. It's all well deserved. There are many good acting performances to mention. However, the icing on the cake is the ever so lovely Teresa Palmer, as the war heroes' wife.",

Not saying his other ones aren't good, I mean Passion of the Christ is a brutal and honest portrayal on what would have happen leading up and during Jesus' execution, and Apocalypto is... Apocalypto. \nThe premise of the movie is actually pretty nuts... I mean yes it's based on a true story, but that's obviously what makes it so insane. I mean it's about a guy who refuses to fire at enemies, and instead runs in during all the firing and explosions to grab out soldiers that are half dead. In a way Mel Gibson is kind of the perfect choice for this as, with his other crazy films, he uses some pretty intense graphic and violent visuals to emphasize the insanity and tension of the situation Garfield's character keeps putting himself into. And Garfield himself actually does an amazing job with role and certainly deserved whatever nominations/awards he got for it.",

Por otro lado, me gustó mucho la descripción exacta de la fe que tiene el protagonista en poder salvar a todos sus compañeros. Las actuaciones son muy buenas de parte de todo el cast, Andrew Garfield da una de las mejores actuaciones de su carrera junto con Hugo Weaving que también la rompe en su papel; también se destacan Teresa Palmer y Vince Vaughn. Me gustó mucho que la película parece estar dividida en dos partes, una con el comienzo contando principalmente la historia de amor del protagonista y toda su vida (la cual me parece una parte muy importante y muy bien contada en la película); y la otra ya formando parte del ejercito. En conclusión, una película tremenda con muy buenas actuaciones y con una historia real que sorprende por la característica personalidad del protagonista. Muy recomendada.",

However, there are too many themes of what I feel like is a \"glorification of old America\" to sit well with me. Testy soldiers being won over by the religious man, the power of prayer, justification of war, etc. etc. etc. Being a Mel Gibson joint, I guess I should've known better, but as this is based on an incredible true story (and one certainly worth being told mind you despite my criticism), I think I can recommend Hacksaw Ridge to any of the other conscientious objectors out there - just try not to roll your eyes too much at the sections you can tell Mel was beating his meat to religious heroism.",

While Garfield has stepped in it plenty of times when it comes to talking about his acting, here we have him at his sweet naive best, the sort of pure open available person he probably wishes he could be in everyday life. He radiates a warmth, and while he's a Brit, there's a certain 'George Gibbs' American-like cheer in his step. One can't help but to fall in love with him, in the way that his smile is contagious, nearly infectious. What makes the best of war movies is tremendous heart, and at the core, we have that here. But make no mistake, the polar opposite is here in spades. The war scenes are devastating, dynamic and explosive. Unlike the life that seems to be seeping out of the bleeding bodies and into the ethers, the life of the images are wholly indelible. One wonders just how scenes like this are even made, with the seeming level of chaos, confusion and moving pieces. And all that violence is what makes Desmond Doss all that more unbelievable. And of course, it's a true story, which makes it all the more watchable. For those who lack the ability to entertain miracles of the human heart, this may not be your film, but for those who have a taste for faith (religious or otherwise) you'll find plenty to connect with in Gibson's war epic at Hacksaw Ridge.",

While this movie does start off a tad slower than other war movies it helps build a better story that will pay off when the war finally does come. And when it comes nothing is held back. The graphic realism of war helps to immerse the viewer into the battle. At its heart it is a classic story of outcast to hero done in a way that doesn't make it feel cliche, this is probably most in part to it being based on a true story. By the end of the film you're left with a good feeling making you believe in heroes again. I realize that sounds cheesy, but it's true.",

            "content": "One cannot deny that Mel Gibson can direct the hell out of a battle sequence but in this film the sequences would seem to go against the ideology of the subject and there is a horror in having the director openly delight in gruesome violence. Additionally the film is very much of two halves and unfortunately the first feels like a laughable parody version of The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) with how cheesy it is and the second half is entirely discordant with this opening. Many acclaimed the film as Gibson's comeback to mainstream Hollywood productions but I have little appreciation for the film beyond Gibson's technical abilities and I wish that it had a stronger screenplay and was less indulgent in graphic violence.\n\nAs a child in Virginia in the 1920s Desmond Doss, Andrew Garfield, almost kills his brother with a brick and is driven to adopt strict Seventh Day Adventist beliefs and is a conscientious objector when World War II begins. He chooses to enlist despite a romance with nurse Dorothy Schutte, Teresa Palmer, but is confronted by the aggressive Sergeant Howell, Vince Vaughn, when he refuses to learn how to use a weapon. He is almost convicted for his actions but when his superiors learn of new laws he is allowed to become a medic without using a gun. He is seen as a coward by his fellow soldiers but proves his heroism during a battle at Hacksaw Ridge during the Battle of Okinawa. He saves 75 men by helping them to escape down a ridge and men who had previously dismissed him are astonished by his bravery and conduct. He returns to civilian life after the war, marries Schutte and does not become boastful about his achievements by choosing instead to thank god.\n\nBefore I discuss the second half of the film, where Gibson's interest really lies, I must discuss the first half which felt more like a television soap opera than Since You Went Away (1944) or whatever 1940s classic he was attempting to evoke. Doss is clearly meant to come as naïve but good hearted in his young adulthood but he seems to have some sort of mental issue as he awkwardly pursues the improbably beautiful nurse. The dialogue in their first date scene was atrocious and Schutte's constant smiles and gentle teasing made her seem like the sort of \n‘ideal' woman that housewives in the 1950s were pushed to act like. When he kisses her in a supposedly spontaneous moment it was totally manufactured and the moment in which Schutte pushes her religious boyfriend to marry her was so cliché that it could have come out of a parody of this sort of film. The parallels with Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor (2001) were uncomfortable and much like that film you feel as bored as the director does waiting for the macho action to begin.\n\nThere is an equally awkward sequence before our men enter the battlefield that tries to get us invested in the ‘zany' soldiers that Doss will be fighting alongside. We open with a surprisingly long shot of a man's buttocks and then hear a group of Australian actors introduce themselves in thick ‘Brooklyn' accents. This does little to make us care and there are so many films that these scenes are reminiscent of, from Full Metal Jacket (1987) to From Here to Eternity (1953), that it is hard to view them on their own. Then he introduces the arbitrary drama of having him court martialed and then ends this part of the film on a dull note as his superiors are informed of a fact that they should have already known.\n\nWhen Doss finally finds himself on the battlefield you can sense that Gibson has relaxed as he does choreograph stunning scenes of gore and violence that inform the audience of the horror of fighting in a war. However beyond all of the explosions and close up shots of blood leaking out of men's severed legs there is the uncomfortable feeling that Gibson is enjoying all of this a little too much and unlike his pacifist hero completely endorses violence. \n\nThe film definitely deserved to be honored for the technical achievements that it made but as a whole it is a disappointment as the points it tries to make about pacifism are buried under Gibson's passion for violence and the dialogue is too hokey to be taken seriously.",

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge\nHacksaw Ridge isn't your typical war movie. Director Mel Gibson takes the clichés of heroism from other war movies and portrays them in an entirely different yet effective way. Ardent patriotism and religious conviction are the central focuses of Mel Gibson's film Hacksaw Ridge. The main character, Desmond Doss - a conscientious objector - refused to carry a weapon into battle yet his bravery in doing so saved the lives of many men during World War II at the battle of Okinawa.  \n\tHacksaw Ridge begins by depicting an ordinary family who have deeply imbedded religious beliefs with two competitive and rambunctious brothers - Desmond and Howard Doss. Their father - once a World War I veteran - grieves from survivors' guilt, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and is a raging alcoholic who is inclined to have violent outbreaks. Outbreaks which are often directed towards Rachel, Desmond's mother. One night during his childhood, Desmond witnessed his father violently abuse and attack his mother at gun point at which point he intervened, grabbed the gun, and pointed it back towards his father. This traumatic experience, along with his spiritual convictions (thou shall not kill), lead Desmond to enlist as a combat medic and to become a conscious objector in World War II, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Desmond's enlistment drove a greater wedge between him and his father. He was angry with his son because he had no desire for either of his sons (both of which ended up enlisting) to serve in the military. \n\tOnce enlisted, Desmond attended basic training where he was ridiculed and begged to leave due to his religious beliefs and his standpoint on carrying a weapon. Shortly into his training, Desmond was Court-Martialed and thrown into a war prison for disobeying a direct order from his commanding officer. Eventually, with the help of his father (which was surprising due to their relationship), Desmond was released from prison and granted the right to enter the war zone as a conscientious objector. At this point in the movie Desmond proves his worth at Okinawa by participating in the attack on Hacksaw Ridge where he saves the lives of many soldiers who would have otherwise died.\n\tMel Gibson separates from the clichés of heroism by showing the internal struggle of an individual (Desmond Doss) rather than the outward struggle many soldiers face on the battlefield. The internal struggle in Hacksaw Ridge is between Desmond's religious beliefs to not kill under any circumstances, and his ardent patriotism - the desire to serving his country during the war. Many directors of war movies focus only on the outward struggles soldiers face during war by depicting the skirmishes they face on the battlefield. Gibson however, portrays both the struggle on the battlefield, as well as in the mind and heart of one specific soldier. \nTake for example another popular war movie Saving Private Ryan. In this film, the director Steven Spielberg portrays the external struggles of a group of soldiers to represent their heroism and willingness to serve their country. Gibson opted to divert from this cliché by portraying the heroic struggle within an individual who wanted to serve his country despite the fact his religious beliefs (to not kill) went against what was optimal for soldiers fighting at that time. This internal struggle Desmond faces makes Hacksaw Ridge more relatable than any other war movie because it is personal and portrays the struggles many of us face between our internal beliefs and the external stimuli we're surrounded by. Although many of us aren't fighting in a war, we face things daily that challenge our internal beliefs just like Desmond. \nWhile the story and messages portrayed in Hacksaw Ridge alone make for a great film, the effects used throughout create a sense of realism which in turn make the internal struggles that Desmond faces appear more severe. As the war progresses, Desmond witnesses many of his friends die painfully around him without the capability or resources to protect and defend them from their enemies. In many cases, individuals who witness traumatic events (such as the events Desmond faced during the war) become more inclined to stray from their internal (religious or emotional) beliefs in order to defend and protect themselves as well as those they care about. This however wasn't the case when it came to Desmond Doss' internal struggles. Not only did Desmond stay true to his religious beliefs by remaining a conscious objector throughout the duration of the war, he took those beliefs and used them to help save the lives of many soldiers.\nOne night after the US military retreated from Hacksaw, Desmond made the heroic decision to stay on the ridge, where he beseeched God asking, \"What is it you want of me; I don't understand; I can't hear you.\" Alone, and without any way of defending himself, Desmond stayed on the ridge begging and pleading to hear God's voice. As he sat there praying to hear God's voice, he heard someone faintly scream for a medic. Unwaveringly, Desmond got up and ran into the battlefield because he knew it was God's voice in someone who needed his help. All night Desmond continued asking God to help him save one more and one more and one more... Taking each opportunity given to him (by God), Desmond continued to hoist injured, dead, and even enemy soldiers off Hacksaw Ridge. All the while, his only protection was asking for God's help in getting each soldier off the ridge.\nAgainst all odds, and despite the ridicule Desmond Doss faced from fellow soldiers in the opening scenes of the film, Desmond changed the lives of many soldiers including those who tormented and begged him to quit from the start. He displayed countless acts of heroism in a different way than any other soldier at that time. Gibson did an immaculate job of portraying how one individual soldier's countless acts of selflessness impacted the lives of many individuals who would have otherwise died. It was because of Desmond's patriotism that many soldiers were able to make it home to their families rather than dying on Hacksaw. Although Desmond Doss was a conscientious objector and went into one of the bloodiest battles of World War II without anything to protect himself, he survived. Not only did he survive, he helped many individuals live to see another day. Because of his bravery and heroism Desmond Doss received the Medal of Honor and is now known as one of the greatest war heroes of all time.",

The Religious overtones are certainly there but not to hit the audience over the head with preachy sermons or \"Bible Thumping\". It's a story about one man's convictions and his unrelenting dedication to them. The pacing is good, the characters all likable, with a surprise role from Vince Vaughn, who I think did a great job as the tough Drill Sergeant. Garfield was fantastic and so adorable in this role. He plays the character perfect and is immediately likable and is someone the audience invests in. And as for the battle sequences, well, I'll let them speak for themselves (They are literally bloody amazing and scary all at the same time)! Also, THIS IS A TRUE STORY. A story I myself have researched and was surprised by how much Gibson had left out of the movie to make it \"more believable\", which is just insane! I am confidently saying, this is my favorite movie from 2016!",

This happened to me, for example, I didn't really drink alcohol, but when I found a girl I liked, I started to drink some wine, not much though. Maybe the difference is that in my case love, one of the strongest emotions, made me change slightly, so it's hard to resist, while in his case there was no love, but he had his principles and his goals which were very important. Maybe that means he was even stronger than love because he had to leave his girl? In any case, that is absolutely incredible.\nThis guy reminds me a lot of me, except he's even stronger than me.\n\nThere is a lot of blood and violence in this movie, but I had the time to look away, so I didn't see too much gross things.\n\nThis movie was very emotional, and I had tears on my eyes and tension throughout the whole movie, not just here and there like it is in some movies. It was very interesting and thanks God for all he does.\n\nIt is interesting that in war people still save their faith in God and maybe even become stronger, even though you might think that seeing all these torn bodies, torn humans which look like simple organisms might make you think that there's no God, but it seems that's not the case. People's faith becomes even stronger in war. For example like everyone wanted Desmond to pray in the end.\nAlso it seems like a lot of people believe in God one way or another.\n\nI recommend this movie to everyone.",

Mel Gibson nailed his work as a director here. He handles the first half of the film solidly, giving us plenty of strong character moments. It's the second half where he truly shines, though. The war sequences are brutal and tense. Body parts fly around, there are abrupt deaths, and you feel like you're right there watching the action in person. It makes sense that this was also nominated for editing and sound mixing. The experience on the battlefield is something truly special. Andrew Garfield (Desmond Doss) gives one of the best performances of his career, other than the bad accent. The rest of the cast like Hugo Weaving (Tom Doss), Sam Worthington (Jack Glover), and the surprisingly strong Vince Vaughn (Sgt. Howell) all bring their best.\n\nWeaknesses: The movie feels long. You completely feel every single minute because some parts do drag in the early stages. Teresa Palmer (Dorothy Schutte) is the one actor who doesn't feel like they're doing a great job. She's not flat out bad, but she lacks something. Her chemistry with Andrew Garfield is almost non-existent, so the love story plot never really works. \n\nOverall: This blew me away and was way better than I expected. Other than some pacing issues and the love story, everything works. We have strong characters, a good script, great direction, and the feel like we're truly watching the brutal nature of war.",

            "content": "This felt like 2 films stitched together. The first half is pretty boring and drags on far too long. We are introduced  to the key characters we are meant to care most about, we are shown why the main character is who he is and what his family life did to create the ultimate pacifist during war. The redeeming factor is the second half. Mel Gibson simply creates these amazingly brutal, realistic battle sequences that hold nothing back. The very first death is shocking in its bloodiness and its abruptness, having a survivor of the previous siege become reanimated, giving away the position of the battalion. Once this has happened, we see his head blown off, followed immediately by the death of the man who disturbed him being dealt a similar fate. The following sequence showcases just how brutal war can be, displaying death as being as normal as breathing. This film being based on a true story adds a sense of amazement as you realize not only is this plausible, but it is also what happened. Watching a man, carrying little more then a giant first aid kit, save 75 men who had been injured during 2 days of fighting upon the titular ridge and roping them down the massive expanse at the detriment of his hands. Andrew Garfield, horrible accent aside, plays this role very well, especially as we get more into the war time scenes and the training sequences. This film was nominated for 6 Oscars, winning for film editing and sound mixing, two things that truly mesmerized me during this film. My only complaint is that we did not get a pay off of the brother going to war first nor do we get any insight into the motivations of the father as he helps his son get into the army and also hearing what he has done in Okinawa. This movie is not for the faint of heart, the depictions of war, fighting and death are very realistic and can be offensive or nauseating to those that are not ready for it.

Is real a movie with a really good message,? keep with me to know it....\nThe director behind this movie is Mel Gibson, a great  his is a war movie, but isn't a normal war movie, this one is special because something that we're going to talk about it later. This movie happens in an island in the pacific near Japan called Okinawa.\nThe actors in this movie are, Andrew Garfield, you may know him because he starred in Spiderman 1 and 2 (2012 and 2014). e's Pvt. Desmond Doss (the protagonist),Teresa Palmer as Dorothy Schutte and Vince Vaughn as St. Howell. In my opinion they  a great performance, because the characters feel real and everyone has a different personality with a different story and everyone fit in together naturally and any role looks forced or is dull. That's a great point \nWhat's this movie about? Well I'm going to tell you a summary, calm down, is spoiler free, lets start.  I like that :)\nThis movie move us to 1945, during WW2 and introduced us to Desmond D. Doss, a man on his 20's that isn't secure who is he. And him in some way feels trapped because of his family. His father (a WW1 veteran) is an alcoholic and mistreat him; his brother; and his mother. This changes when his brother enlist to the U.S. army. He starts thinking and his conclucion is than he can't stay calm when a lot of people are dying because of the war, so he enlisted as a medic, because he doesn't want to touch a gun because of a trauma. From this point to the end of the movie, we can see a Desmond that is changing, because of the live of a soldier. but he always keep his ideals, helping all the people he can.  How he can afront all the problems that he has and how he saved 75 soldiers than were hurried in the battlefield, and later how he sacrifice himself to save his partners. At the end of the movie, we can see a brave man that has clear who he is and his purpose in life.\nWell, this is a small summary of the movie plot.I think that now you can make you an idea of it. In my opinion, this story is really good,(is almost perfect) the only problem is that sometimes can be so difficult to understand and can be so gore in some parts of it, but in front of that, is a really good and interesting movie that you should see if you didn't watch it yet. \nWhatever, now let's talk about the movie impressive qualities,\nCinematography: In my opinion, the cinematography of this movie is perfect, the colors reflect exactly what it wants to tell us and it creates the perfect ambient in every single scene.\nSoundtrack, the soundtrack is also really good (because of that, it won the oscar price for the best sound) and also the sound effects are precise in each case of the movie .\nDefinitely the best scene of the movie is when Desmont save the hurt soldiers that were left in the battlefield (because of this he won the medal of the brave in the movie). This the best, because is so dramatic and you don't know what's going to happen next. \nSpecial effects, the special effects are very realistic and in some parts you can feel that you were in the movie, so cool.\nEmotional effects, This can be the only part of the movie that is not so good.at, This is because they didn't get that the people become sad or excited in all the necessary parts.\nWell, this was my review about (in my opinion) one of the best movies ever. That have really good things, but in some parts, can be very gore for someone's or also can be a little bit confusing.\nHowever, I supposed that I should grate this movie no? So this is my final grate for this movie:\n9,86/10\nI know that someone can be in disagreement with me, but remember that is just an opinion. Well, in respect of the fans, they were happy about the movie:\nYou should see it, because it has really good messages and great actors. \nWell, like I said before, I'm going to explain the meaning of this movie, this one is:\nAlways be there to help the other: This message is in all the movie.Every action;dialog and scene in someway, arrives to this message:be there and give all of yourself to save others.\nWell, that was my review, I hope that you like it, so, what are you waiting? Go to your TV and watch Hacksaw Ridge.\n\n\"With the world so set on tearing itself apart, I don't seem like such a bad thing to me to wanna put a little bit of it back together\" \n\nBy Agustin",

So I was only a little irritated that the movie has him signing up for the army. I kept saying, \"He was drafted. He was drafted.\" I felt it made him look stupid to sign up as a \"conscientious objector\". But that's only a small flaw in an otherwise marvelous tribute to this war hero. The movie doesn't even show the half of the persecution he came under during boot camp. They made his life a living hell. And even as fantastically heroic as the movie portrays him, and how miraculous his single-handedly saving 75 men was, it actually holds back some. Gibson wanted the movie to be believable and some of what actually happened to Doss was unbelievable. Doss actually wasn't crouching down many times, he was standing erect shouting down instructions to his fellow soldiers as tons of bullets whizzed by him, never hitting him. One Japanese soldier told that he had Doss in his sites and his gun jammed several times and he was unable to shoot him. If you can handle the true depiction of war this is a must see film. It doesn't hold back on the violence and gore. (And even unnecessarily shows things happening in slow-mo. This is why I didn't give it a full 5 stars.) Vince Vaughn was excellent as the drill sergeant. He makes you laugh at first and then he makes you cry toward the end. My eyes filled with tears when the real Desmond Doss was shown receiving his Medal of Honor from President Truman. You've just got to see this guy's story!",

I've heard some people say that they couldn't see a Woody Allen because \"he's a perv\" and some saying the same for Tarantino because he can be too loud (for me, he's the man!). I've never been one of this people but I do believe we have to take into consideration a filmmaker's life to understand his work. Thus, my perception of The 400 Blows wouldn't be the same without me knowing about Truffaut's childhood or Edward Scissorhands would be less impactful had I not known of Burton's inner struggles growing up. I truly believe that Mel Gibson is a despicable person and not that great of an actor... But, he's a talented director! Firstly, the film is based on a great true story that everyone should learn about which is a great structure to the fine script. Garfield is powerful and believable in the character, Hugo Weaving is menacing and, surprisingly, Vince Vaughn is a pertinent casting decision.  What may stand out the most about this film is how Gibson constructs a battle scene. He does it without mercy, showing us the true nature of war, all the blood and guts splattering all over, the big explosions and the courage in the soldier's eyes. This, which is supported by thoughtful editing, rugged cinematography and convincing makeup/ SFX work makes up for an immersive experience that is both engrossing and hard to look away from. It's war in it's purest form, like I haven't seen for a while. The problem is precisely when the director's personality surfaces and lets his over-nationalistic pride take over the whole picture. In this day and age, I do think that we shouldn't portray enemies, villains, etc in any kind of movie as generic, as nothing more than evil. This dehumanization of the antagonist is all too problematic in this film, as the Japanese seem to serve the only purpose of being blown up. Furthermore, the stereotypically southern way characters interact, how they create friendships, how they fall in love makes it hard for me to relate to them. Still, the film hit me hard at the end when footage of the real Desmond Doss was shown and I no longer could fight the tears. It's like Gibson was able to pass on to me the ominous patriotic feel and give me a taste of what war actually feels like, which is no easy feat.",

            "content": "It has been my belief that in war, most of the time there are no heroes, only participants. But, in Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge, there is a hero. A hero in its truest sense. In this year's another sensational film, La La Land, we saw how it is important to never let go of what you want or what you dream, even if the circumstances are trying. In Hacksaw Ridge, we see even in dire situations and in face of dreadful consequences how it is important to never let go of who you are. \n\nFor in Hacksaw Ridge, the protagonist Desmond Doss reminds us that it is the belief, the ideology of person and their actions that define them and not the fulfillment of norms. Based on true events, the film tells the story of an American man who becomes the first Conscientious Objector to win the Medal of Honor. To put in a simpler term, Desmond Doss' belief and conscience does not allow him to kill another human being, or even pick a gun. He still enlists to serve as a combat medic.\n\nWhat follows, is a struggle. Both internal and external where Doss is subjected to humiliation, violence and time in jail. There even comes a time when he had to choose between love and the belief that made him the person he is. But, his unfaltering energy and determination to stay true in its own eyes make him the hero that this film is celebrating. \n\nMel Gibson and writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan strike the perfect balance between a biographical drama and a war film. At one side, the battle scenes are shot exquisitely. Filled with realism and horrors of war. Gibson doesn't pull his punches in showing the harrowing brutality. The film would remind people of the battles in Saving Private Ryan or in the excellent mini-series Band of Brothers. At another side, there's enough room in the film to explore the life of Doss. The relationship with his father, his love for his wife, all these beautifully depicts the tenderness, the gentle yet resolute soul of Doss. \n\nAndrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss and I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job than him in this role. Garfield's boyish charm reflects the character's innocence. Be it when he flirts or when he refuses to carry firearms, he seems sincere and determined and yet gentle and sweet. The film is buoyed by the heroism of the character of Desmond Doss, which in turn is buoyed by Garfield's acting. The chemistry between Garfield and a fine Teresa Palmer, who plays Dorothy, Desmond's wife, strikes the emotional chord enough to give a dramatic dimension in this film. Speaking of emotional bond, Hugo Weaving churns a top performance as Doss' father. You feel the desperation and the frustration his character feels when his sons enlist in the army, as he had watched most of his friends die while serving himself. The supporting cast of 77th Infantry Division, including Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, and Vince Vaughn, does well too. Particularly Vaughn.\n\nMel Gibson directs this film after a gap of approximately 10 years, and it would appear that the time has not put rust on his direction mettle. Hacksaw Ridge is perhaps the best War film of this decade and certainly one of the finest of this genre.",

            "content": "Over-the-top and excessive in every aspect (some might say indulgent, but others seem to love over-dramatized films like this), from the stereotypic love story to the unrelenting battle scenes.  Mel Gibson directed and having not seen any other films by him, I can only suspect that the mix of hard-core religion and ultra-violence is his own personal signature.  Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who nevertheless signs up for combat duty in WWII (in the Pacific theatre) to serve as a medic.  He gets hard done by during boot camp, pilloried for his religious beliefs and nearly court-martialled and drummed out of the service for refusing to carry a weapon.  But, of course, he prevails and ends up with the medal of honour.  The true story upon which the film is based is undoubtedly moving and inspiring but the syrupy ode to the man is pretty tough to take at times.  The centrepiece of the film is more than an hour of gory battle scenes, with corpses everywhere, men dying in horrific fashion, and a genuine hell-on-earth mise-en-scene.  Perhaps this is how battle really feels - but do you really need to see it?  I'm sure the technical wizardry required is impressive but again, the sweeping music and dramatic crescendos nearly capsize things.  A bunch of Australians take roles here (alongside an always charismatic Vince Vaughan) but few are able to define their characters above the fray.  Watch if you must but there are better war films (e.g., The Steel Helmet, 1951 or The Big Red One, 1980, both by Sam Fuller).",

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge *****War is Hell but there's a Angel on Hacksaw Ridge\n\nMel Gibson returns to the Director's Chair and into Hollywood's Good books with this epic WW2 story Hacksaw Ridge. After a decade in limbo and Gibson passing on the project twice (same with Braveheart) finance coming in from Australia this true life story finally gets a cinematic outing. \n?The film is based on the true story of Desmond Doss played by Andrew Garfield an conscientious objector who joins the army in WW2 but refuses to carry or use a weapon. \n\nThis film is by all facts a mixed genre film being Action/Drama. The first half is almost a tender TV Drama showing the story of Doss from childhood , the series of events that shape him as a man and later his decision to join the army but keep to devout his religious beliefs. \nDoss is by all means a unique individual who cares deeply about family, honour and faith taking joy in helping others. \n\nHis decision to join the army in order to be a medic is one that causes friction around him but the decision that he will not use a weapon is one that causes most provocation for Doss who becomes the point of hatred in the army. Victimised, picked on, attacked and taken to military court Doss is risking everything he has for everything he believes and the unfolding of his predicament is touching entertaining drama at it's best. \n?The second half of the film sees Doss enter War and not since From Dusk Till Dawn has there been a more violent Genre shift from Drama to Action/Horror as Gibson shows you first hand the extreme horrors of War. You can understand the pursuit of Gibson services as his CV shows his no novice at War films having directed Braveheart and later shown true horrors of violence in The Passion Of The Christ here he brings all his skills to the table. Pulling no punches with the extreme shift in tempo shows a slight glimpse of what the real life soldiers of war most of envisioned when they first step foot into the hells of the battlefields and futility of war with such wasted life on both sides. \n\n\nIn this hell the soldiers are expected to take Hacksaw Ridge a viscous battle that will cost many lives. It's in this hell that Doss makes it his mission to risk his life in order to save as many lives as possible. This is where the real life Doss reportedly saved 75 wounded soldiers an outstanding feet that made him a hero. \nThere is excellent supporting acting with highlights from Hugo Weaving one of Hollywood most underrated talents who plays Doss's Father horrendously mentally handicapped from his fighting in WW1 as well a welcomed comedy relief from Vince Vaughn as Doss's stern commanding officer.   ?\n\nGibson features real life footage at the end of the film which shows you the real life Doss and it's only here you can then fully appreciate the amazing Job Andrew Garfield did of portraying him as the real life Doss has a unique speaking pattern that seemed odd when first watching the film but then replaced when you appreciate the actors replicated authentically. You would expect most Hollywood films to disregard such attention to details having Doss persona replaced by a more bankable image with a John Wayne type lead marching over the Ridge saving everyone in sight. The choice not to do reinforces the remarkable real life story of a man that was utterly selfless demonstrating the best of human potential. \n\n?This is glorious to see this type of story made and most importantly respected. In such depressing real life times we live in where there is constant examples of negative behaviour it's a true refreshing experience to see a recreation of truly decent example of a human ability for goodness. The decision to put real life clips at the end of the film and show the audiences the true hero we saw who tells the audience his will to save others in the darkest hour of war is what moved this review from four stars to five.  \n?Further research into the real life Doss actually depicts that the film toned down some of the real heroism to make it more believable is a testimonial in itself. ",

There are elements of glorification of America, but towards the end they begin to build up some sympathy for some of the Japanese soldiers, so it wasn't too anti-Japanese. This film is definitely worth the watch. Small warning, I would say its above Saving Private Ryan in terms of levels of violence in war scenes.

            "content": "In the war based action movie with gunfire they key is to save people. Hacksaw Ridge, starring Andrew Garfield (Desmond), Teresa Palmer (Dorothy), and  Vince Vaughn (Sergeant Howell), brings a pack of punch to the world of camp and war. Andrew Garfield (Desmond) is a country boy who is on a mission to save people in the war, but he encounters problems along the way that could possibly stop that from happening. Without giving up he goes to the head general to state that he only wants to save people and not fight. The movie is directed by Mel Gibson, who has also directed The Expendables 3 and The Lethal Weapon series, so if you like movies with gunfire this is a really good movie. Overall the movie looks great; Desmond's action based skills are over the top compared to everyone else. He is one of the bravest medics ever in a war.  However as the movie goes on Desmond never changes his attitude as he fights the war. Andrew Garfield's  performance was outstanding and making you want to finish the movie to see how it plays out, much like Bradley Cooper (Chris Kyle) in American Sniper with the dedication to save and protect his country. Overall I give this movie five out of five stars. So if you can take a little blood and explosions sit down with some snacks and enjoy the movie.",

            "content": "As a child, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) nearly kills his younger brother Hal. This experience and his Seventh-day Adventist upbringing reinforce Desmond's belief in the commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\". Years later, Doss takes an injured man to the hospital and meets a nurse, Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer). The two begin a relationship and Doss tells Dorothy of his interest in medical work. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Doss enlists in the Army and intends to serve as a combat medic. His father Tom, a troubled World War I veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Before leaving for Fort Jackson, he asks for Dorothy's hand in marriage and she accepts. Doss is placed under the command of Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn). He excels physically but becomes an outcast among his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays. Howell and Captain Glover  (Sam Worthington) attempt to discharge Doss for psychiatric reasons but are overruled, as Doss' religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness. They subsequently torment Doss by putting him through grueling labor, intending to get Doss to leave of his own accord. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, he refuses to identify his attackers and continues training. Doss' unit completes basic training and is released on leave, during which Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Doss in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge but Doss refuses to compromise his beliefs. At his trial, Doss pleads not guilty, but before he is sentenced, his father barges into the tribunal with a letter from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. The charges against Doss are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married. Doss' unit is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and deployed to the Pacific theater. During the Battle of Okinawa, Doss' unit is informed that they are to relieve the 96th Infantry Division, which was tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment (\"Hacksaw Ridge\"). In the initial fight, both sides sustain heavy losses, and Doss successfully saves several wounded soldiers. The Americans camp for the night, which Doss spends in a foxhole with Smitty, a squadmate who was the first to call Doss a coward. Doss reveals that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father, who threatened his mother with a gun. Smitty apologizes for doubting his courage and the two make amends. The next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed, while Howell and several of Doss' squad mates are left injured on the battlefield. Doss hears the cries of dying soldiers and returns to save them, carrying wounded soldiers to the cliff's edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Hacksaw Ridge uses a real-life pacifist's legacy to lay the groundwork for a gripping wartime tribute to faith, valor, and the courage of remaining true to one's convictions.\" The Milford Daily News called the film a \"masterpiece\", adding that it \"is going to end up on many 2016 Top 10 lists, that should get Oscar nominations for Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.\" Maggie Stancu of Movie Pilot wrote that \"Gibson made some of his most genius directing choices in Hacksaw Ridge, and Garfield has given his best performance yet. With amazing performances by Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer, Sam Worthington and Hugo Weaving, it is absolutely one of 2016's must-see films.\" Mick LaSalle of SFGate called the film \"a brilliant return for Mel Gibson, which confirms his position as a director with a singular talent for spectacle and a sure way with actors.\" In The Film Lawyers, Samar Khan called Hacksaw Ridge \"fantastic,\" and emphasised \"just how wonderful it is to have Gibson back in a more prominent position in Hollywood, hopefully with the demons of his past behind him. If Hacksaw Ridge is any indication, we are poised for a future filled with great films from the visionary director.\" The Daily Telegraph awarded four stars, and added: \"Hacksaw Ridge is a fantastically moving and bruising war film that hits you like a raw topside of beef in the face - a kind of primary-coloured Guernica that flourishes on a big screen with a crowd.\" The Guardian also awarded the film four stars, and stated that Gibson had \"absolutely hit Hacksaw Ridge out of the park.\" The Australian's reviewer was equally positive, stating that, as a director, \"Gibson's approach is bold and fearless; this represents his best work to date behind the camera.\" Rex Reed of Observer rated it with four stars, and called it \"the best war film since Saving Private Ryan... [I]t is violent, harrowing, heartbreaking and unforgettable. And yes, it was directed by Mel Gibson. He deserves a medal, too\". Michael Smith of Tulsa World called Hacksaw Ridge a \"moving character study\" and praised both the direction and acting: \"It's truly remarkable how Gibson can film scenes of such heartfelt emotion with such sweet subtlety as easily as he stages some of the most vicious, visual scenes of violence that you will ever see. ... Hacksaw Ridge is beautiful and brutal, and that's a potent combination for a movie about a man determined to serve his country, as well as his soul.\" IGN critic Alex Welch gave a score of 8/10, praising it as \"one of the most successful war films of recent memory,\" and \"at times horrifying, inspiring, and heart-wrenching.\" Mike Ryan of Uproxx gave the film a positive review, praising Gibson's direction and saying, \"There are two moments during the second half of Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge when I literally jumped out of my seat in terror. The film's depiction of war is the best I've seen since Saving Private Ryan.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3.5 stars, writing, \"Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a filmmaker, able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness.\" In contrast, Matt Zoller Seitz for RogerEbert.com gave the film 2.5 stars, and described the film as \"a movie at war with itself.\"\n\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\" is visually stunning at times and Mel Gibson has tried to make a classic epic warmovie from back in the days with an obvious large budget. However, he hasn´t really succeeded in my point of view compared to all the praise it has been given. The script and plot offers not much to excite you and it´s pretty much predictable from the first 30 minutes. And Gibson has used all the clichés he can imagine. The problem is as well that the heroic actions taken by Doss on the battlefield becomes almost cartoony and too Jesus like and makes Doss real life bravery a bit off in my opinion. Meaning that Gibson hasn´t managed to film that in a satisfying way. And you can´t dodge the fact that Gibson has put so much emphasis on catholic themes looking like propaganda, it is pretty clear that was part of his agenda when making the film. The action scenes have a bit too clear CGI effects, the film has a not satisfying casting (for example Vince Vaughn (terrible) and I don´t like Andrew Garfield whom I don´t think is convincing as Doss) and there´s a bit too much general flagwaving. But, you can´t take away the bravery of real Desmond Doss and what he did during WWII. It´s a shame the film can´t manage to portray that in a proper way.",

It's some of the worst war cinematography and production that Hollywood has ever produced. People are getting upset about all of the gory violence, but that doesn't bother me because it was so over the top it was like a bad 1980s horror film. What was really bad was the directing, because at no point is there any sense of tactical awareness by any soldier in the whole dang movie. The artillery looks like the hollywood charges that they are. Soldiers just get in a mob and run at machine guns. There's a lot of smoke and cut shots that just don't work.\n\nVince Vaugn machine guns like 12 enemies while Garfield drags him on a blanket through a battlefield.

The battle scenes - Saving Private Ryan. \nAlso, for a film about a man who would not kill - there is a lot of gore and excessive violence.

            "content": "Based on the true story of Desmond Doss, Hacksaw Ridge tells the extraordinary story of how he became a medic as a conscientious objector in WWII and saved many lives without ever firing a gun.\nThe acting is fantastic across the board and this is Andrew Garfield's best performance to date, as Desmond Doss he is able to embody a simple naivety, somewhat akin to Forest Gump, and a great wealth of emotion as his character develops but stays true to his beliefs. Hugo Weaving also puts in a layered performance as his father, Tom Doss, who is a damaged and violent man bearing the scars of his time in the military. Luke Bracey also makes a great, somewhat villainous character Smitty Ryker, who gets a reasonable character arc but could have done with a little more screen time.\nBeing based around real events and real people, the plot is extremely interesting and truly inspiring. Due to his upbringing and his religion Desmond has a very strong set of principles and refuses to take a life and rather help the war effort by saving lives as a medic. The obstacles he faces and the dedication he has to this goal is truly inspiring and has a very uplifting message.\nThe pace is a little inconsistent throughout the film, there is quite a long build to the conflict at Hacksaw Ridge where the pace is slow but it's well used with character development and back story that pays off as the pace speeds up. The tension is also built up very well leading to the initial gunfire and it manages to maintain this at the crucial moments towards the end of the film. The romantic storyline however is the weakest part of the film, with quite cheesy dialogue and moments that could have been cut down. The other men Desmond undertakes his training with are also a little cartoonish and could have done with a little more character development to get the audience more invested in their welfare at Hacksaw Ridge. \nThe action scenes on the other hand are very well done and don't glorify it. The violence is extremely brutal and realistic looking and really draws you into the shock and horror of those moments. The sound design in these scenes is also extremely good and the use of slow motion really amplifies the more horrifying or heroic moments. \nThis film really is masterfully performed and directed and manages to stand out as something truly special and different from a lot of other war films.",

Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss who due to events in his private life while growing up becomes a pacifist and conscientious objector to war.  This earns him the the label of coward from his fellow soldiers who want nothing to do with him as they believe he has no right to be on the battlefield.  However, Doss was the first man ever to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour without picking up a single weapon due to the number of lives he saved on the battlefield at Okinawa.

A true story from the second world war, Doss single handedly searched and rescued 75 wounded soldiers when the troops had left them for dead at Hackshaw Ridge. Unknown to the commander that Doss had stayed behind to search for the wounded under heavy Japanese troops attack.  Nothing short of a miracle and a requirement of  superhuman strength to accomplish the super heroic feat. . Not since Saving Private Ryan has another film depicted war violence so gruesomely bloody,realistically and relentlessly. Severed limbs and bullet entry wounds were just too realistic for comfort. I was squirming a lot while watching the scenes of massacre.  Excellent film with a huge dose of Christian faith that enabled Doss to display selfless heroism. A theme probably relished greatly by director Mel Gibson, who gave us the incredible Passion of Christ.",

The story is about a man who enlists as a medic in a war with Japan during the end of WW2, without bearing arms. Just that story alone was brilliant enough to get me captivated, and the movie around it was absolutely astonishing. The intensity of the battle scenes, seeing the violence, gore, and trauma that soldiers experience in the battlefield was slightly disturbing, but all the more exhilarating. This is a war movie that successfully shows you what it takes to have the courage to serve your country in battle, without glorifying violence or war. Andrew Garfield (Desmond T. Doss) did a fantastic job at portraying this war hero, and was just as good in the battle scenes than he was in the other, lighter scenes, where we got insight into his home life and his relationship with his wife. I also have to mention Vince Vaughn (Sgt. Howell), even though I'm so used to seeing him in comedy movies, this complete change of direction in his character worked really well, and he was great in his role as the intimidating, yet sarcastic Sergeant. There are a lot of scenes in this movie which really show the bare fear that these soldiers have throughout the war, which is a bit of a change from the other movies, who always portray the soldiers as immune, unstoppable heroes. This way, it shows more of the human side of these soldiers, and really showed me what it could have been like in the actual battlefield if you were outnumbered and about to get flanked. The story of Desmond Doss is one of courage, strength and an incredible amount of bravery, which sound like a cliche for these war movies, but \"Hacksaw Ridge\" takes it to a whole other level. The intensity and exhilaration that came with this movie, leaves me saying that \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is unbelievable.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Let s take a look at Mel Gibson s latest offering - Hacksaw Ridge.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Its a story about a great hero from our home state of Virginia. How cool is that? Let s recap.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to young Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) who lives with his WWI veteran father, his mother, and older brother. Doss has fallen in love with a beautiful young nurse at the local hospital. When his brother joins the army to fight the Nazis, Doss decides to join too. But he s a conscientious objector. As a child he often got into fights with his brother and nearly killed him once. That experience, and his Seventh-Day Adventist upbringing, caused him to vow never to touch a gun. Naturally, this belief engages him in some friction when he enlists.\n\nSCOTT: Doss refuses to handle a gun during training, and as a result his commanding officer, Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) makes Doss s life miserable as a soldier. Howell also tries to have Doss discharged for psychiatric reasons. Doss, however, refuses to quit and is about to be court martialed until his father (Hugo Weaving) intervenes by pulling a favor with the Brigadier General. Doss is finally allowed to serve as a medic in the war, and is sent to fight in Okinawa without a gun.\n\nGREG: Scott, I was surprised by this film. I had anticipated a Christian Inspirational. So many Christian films put the message ahead of the story and the film suffers as a result. Hacksaw puts story front and center. And in doing so, delivers its message in spectacular form. On the other hand, I was surprised by the brutality and graphic nature of the film. Steven Spielberg s Saving Private Ryan was well-known for its graphic portrayal of war. But director Mel Gibson has raised the bar to new heights - or perhaps lowered it to new lows - depending on your point of view. This view of war makes clear just how horrible war can be. There were images of dismembered bodies, entrails, and killing that were so graphic, the viewer can believe they were in a war.\n\nSCOTT: I m with you, Greg. Hero stories don t come any better than this. Doss possesses most if not all of the Great Eight traits of heroes -- he s smart, strong, reliable, caring, selfless, resilient, and inspiring. You could even argue that he is quietly charismatic. His heroic power also derives from his ability to resist social pressure. Doss receives intense heat to conform to military standards, and he s probably the only hero I know who sticks to his guns by eschewing them. After watching almost seven seasons of The Walking Dead, I ve become desensitized to graphic displays of violence and human innards. Like most modern movies, this film shows more gore than it has to, but I don t blame Mel Gibson because audiences have come to expect it. One could also argue that Doss s heroism is enhanced by his overcoming horrific violence, explosions, and flamethrower carnage.\n\nGREG: Doss is an extraordinary hero. He went into battle without a weapon. Then, when all the other soldiers had left the battlefield, Doss went back and single-handedly, one-by-one lowered 75 wounded men from a cliff over 12 hours. He had to overcome his fears and ignore his fatigue. The men in his unit considered what he did a miracle. So much so, that they refused to go into battle again the next day unless he went with them. It s a remarkable hero s journey. We see some mentors in Doss s life, not all of them positive. His father is a very negative mentor. Scott, we often talk about dark mentors (people who lead a hero down the wrong path). But Doss s father represents what we ve come to know as the anti-mentor. This is a person who leads the hero down a path by showing the counter-example. Doss s father was so abusive that it caused Doss to vow never to touch a gun. That was just as powerful a mentoring as any positive mentor.\n\nSCOTT: Yes, but Doss s father also redeems himself by using his connections to help Doss avoid court martial. We don t see very many redeemed anti-mentors in the movies. But we do see many instances of parents who play a pivotal mentoring role in either a child s heroism or villainy. This year s The Accountant is a recent example. It s interesting that Doss is a great hero because he not only transforms himself, he transforms others. At the end of the movie, several soldiers approach him sheepishly, admitting to Doss that they were wrong about him and asking him for forgiveness. The men Doss served with are forever inspired by Doss and transformed by serving with him. The man who first identified the various stages of the hero s journey, Joseph Campbell, argued that the hero s positive influence on other is the ultimate culmination of the hero s journey.\n\nGREG: Hacksaw Ridges is a powerful tribute to a pacifist hero. While the film was grisly at times, it made the case for a conscientious objector who made a difference. The movie gets off to a slow start - giving us a lot of backstory of Doss s early life. I was also thrown off by the frequent flashbacks. But the thrilling climax makes up for any problems in pacing. I was shocked at first by the gore, but I recovered enough to enjoy the story. I give Hacksaw Ridge 4 out of 5 Reels. Doss is an unlikely hero. As a pacifist with a religious objection to carrying a gun, he has to show his devotion to his country and to his comrades in other ways. When he looks past his own safety and fatigue to rescue the men in his battalion, he exposes his true heroic nature. He is the epitome of the selfless hero. I give Desmond Doss 5 out of 5 Heroes. Once again we are met with a number of lesser mentors. Doss s father represents an anti-mentor who shows Doss a path by his counter example. And I consider his drill sergeant a dark mentor since he derides Doss and gives tacit permission for the other men to abuse Doss. I give these mentors just 3 out of 5 Mentor points.  Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Greg, you nailed it. Hacksaw Ridge is a must-see movie. You just don t encounter a better example of heroism than this, a form of heroism that is packed with off-the-charts selflessness and profound moral conviction. I prefer the term Doss uses to describe himself: A conscientious cooperator more than a conscientious objector. He wants to serve in the military, but only on his pacifistic terms. Heroes who stand up to social pressure to do the right thing, and who risk their lives to save others, are our most powerful heroes. I give Hacksaw Ridge 5 Reels out of 5. The hero s journey is also potent, and it is broken up into two separate journeys. The first half of the film details Doss s ordeal at basic training, during which Doss is thrown into the dangerous world of the dissenter who dares to defy the military convention to use weaponry. In this hero s journey, Doss s only ally is his father, a broken man who redeems himself by helping Doss pass basic training and get shipped to Okinawa. At Okinawa, Doss s second hero s journey emerges, one that propels him into brutal combat while he saves 75 men with Japanese sharpshooters all around him. These are two powerful journeys, earning Doss 5 shining Hero points out of 5. I see a bit more mentoring going on than you do, Greg. Besides the dark mentoring of his father and sergeant, let s not forget the ultimate mentor, God, whose divine presence is repeatedly guiding and supporting Doss during his darkest moments. Whether you believe in God or not, there is no denying that Doss relied on Him to get him through all his travails. I give these mentors 4 Mentor points out of 5. Reels: Mentors: Heroes:",

            "content": "Mel Gibson returns to bring one of the greatest war and extreme commitment movies of all time!\n\nBased of the conflict on Okinawa island in 1945, to secure it for an airbase for the invasion of mainland Japan. U.S. troops had to scale the 400-foot cliff face named Maeda Escarpment, also known as \"Hacksaw Ridge\" to the Americans. The Japanese troops had been there for years preparing for the war. The entire island was one massive camouflaged tunnel, trench, or trap of some sort. Climbing that cliff face, the Americans were immediately met with heavy and direct machine gun, mortar, grenade, and small arms rifle fire.\n\nThe movie is not one for the faint hearted, whereas the very first scene of the film is that of blood, bodies, severed limbs and rotting death. Mel Gibson returns to bring one of the greatest war and extreme commitment movies of all time! The strengths and unimaginable resolve Desmond Doss displays throughout this movie in his faith, romantic love, overcoming bullies and war itself, is unfounded. The previous Great War movie, \"Saving Private Ryan\", would be child's play in terms of gore and combat imagery contained within \"Hacksaw Ridge\". If you ever imagined what war would be like, this movie will give you a very good insight.\n\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a true story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a very faithful Seventh-day Adventist from Virginia, who grew up in an abusive household. His father (Hugo Weaving) who fought in WWI, now has PTSD, drowns himself in alcohol to cope with the loss of his fellow soldiers and takes his aggression out on his wife and children. Desmond is a conscientious objector, or a 'conscientious cooperator' as he calls himself due to him volunteering for the Army. Enlisting as a Medic, because of his strict convections to God, he'll never has to touch a weapon; or so he thinks.\n\nHis father is the first to try and persuade Desmond from serving. His brother who shows up to dinner in his uniform, shortly after enlisting in the Army Infantry, strikes a nerve with his father. He begins to relive the horrible scene when his best friend in France was shot in the back, 'blowing his intestines out the front, awful everywhere'. He is so distraught that he tells his son to get out of his sight. Doss later meets his father at the cemetery where he's standing above his friends who were killed in action. He tells Doss that \"everybody else jumps in and does things without thinking. Soldiers who live, they live because they can do that, you can't! You have to sit there, think and pray about everything\". Doss tells his father that he wouldn't be able to live with himself if he didn't enlist.\n\nHis conviction to his God and the duty to serve are tested quickly from the moment Doss arrives at basic training. He is met with hate, disrespect, hazing, and judgement by his fellow soldiers; even his Captain (Sam Worthington) and Sergeant (Vince Vaughn) partake in the abuse, when they find out he's a conscientious objector. Most of the men turn against him, belittle him for his beliefs, brand him a coward, and beat him severely because if it. Doss barely makes it through training alive and out of a prison sentence, after facing a Court Martial for disobeying a direct order - the refusal to pick up a rifle and train.\n\nFalling in love with Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) before leaving for Army basic training, his love for her is tested in the Court Martial confinement cell. While visiting Doss, his fiancé pleads with him to find another way 'who you going to save in prison? Pick up the gun and wave it around. Meet them half way'. Remaining steadfast in his conviction he won't break Gods' commandment of 'Thou Shalt Not Kill' and to himself to do his duty to his country. In a very lose-lose situation, he finds himself in front of the Judge Advocate for his case. Narrowly escaping a long prison sentence, his father returns to deliver a letter that ultimately frees Doss so that he can continue his training.\n\nEverything would change drastically when they land on Okinawa, to scale \"Hacksaw Ridge\", and conquer the island. Every one of those men who beat, belittled, and swore that he would get more soldiers killed were biting their tongues when he saved each and every one of them on top of that ridge. When most of his company retreated down the cliff after being overran, calling in Naval Gunfire on their own positions, Desmond remained at the top. He could have easily gone down with his men and been safe at base camp, but he remained.\n\nThe amount of extreme commitment, not only to his fellow soldiers on that mountain but also to God, to accomplish his goal to see that each one of them would return to their families. Reaching his breaking point, Doss holds his best friend dying in his arms \"I don't understand. I can't hear you\" he hears the cries \"MEDIC!!\" and returns into the smoke and bombing to retrieve his fallen comrades. Hands torn, bloodied and rope burned \"Lord, help me get one more\" Doss repeats, as he goes on to send over 75 men, both American and Japanese, over \"Hacksaw Ridge\" to be rescued. This eventually led him to being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, the first ever conscientious objector to do so.*\n\nThe ability to remain so dedicated throughout everything Doss endures in this movie really moves you. The comradeship and bravery is astounding throughout the entire movie. Even if Doss isn't willing to kill another human being, he surely shows that he is willing to die for his convictions and to protect his fellow brother. This is made apparent by disobeying another direct order to retreat, as Naval gunfire bombs the ridge, to go back and save his fellow soldiers time after time.\n\nAn intense look into war, commitment, and the ability to prove everyone wrong. Just as Doss' father had a different outlook on life after WWI, expect to have that same feeling when you finish \"Hacksaw Ridge\"!\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\n*Thomas William Bennett and Joseph Guy LaPointe Jr. would both receive a MoH posthumously, for separate actions, while serving as an Army Medics during the Vietnam War.",

            "content": "After I saw \"The Social Network\" for the first time, I knew Andrew Garfield would become a terrific actor. I looked at him as a serious actor with the ability to impress his viewers with dramatic scenes of intensity and good heartiness. I felt he fell into the trap of the Marvel Universe with the Amazing Spider-man films as he did not bring anything special to the character of Peter Parker. Granted the mediocre scripts and overabundance of cartoon-ish CGI did not help Mr. Garfield but even so, his dominance was lacking. He returned to the dramatic role with 2014's underrated \"99 Homes,\" where he plays a father trying to support his family during the recession. It was a great movie that brought Mr. Garfield back into playing field which would eventually lead to \"Hacksaw Ridge,\" an incredible true story of a pacifist's legacy on the battlefield during World War II.\n\nThe movie follows the life of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a conscientious objector who served as an army medic during the Battle of Hacksaw Ridge on Okinawa, one of the bloodiest battles during World War II. Due to Doss' strong beliefs, he was the only soldier during the war who went into battle without a weapon. This is something that his fellow soldiers looked down on and tried to push (and sometimes punch) Doss out of the army. Though even with all the bruises, threats, and potential jail time, Doss stood by his religious and moral beliefs and was able to enter the war and stand by his brothers-in-arms.\n\nThe Battle of Hacksaw Ridge is one of the greatest set pieces - as well as one of the bloodiest - in the history of film. Director Mel Gibson, receiving a nomination for his outstanding work, delivers an intense, graphic interpretation of the bloodiest battle of World War II. Soldiers on both sides are torn to shreds by bullets, shrapnel, artillery, and suicide soldiers with grenades. The film reminds me of Mel Gibson's \"We Were Soldiers,\" a war film set during  in Vietnam where blood and gore were not wasted. While \"We Were Soldiers\" have too much excessive gore, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" does it to gives us an insight to what Doss was looking at throughout the battle.\n\nWhile the battle is a fantastic, edge-of-your-seat masterpiece, the real tense moments of the film come in the aftermath. After the U.S. army retreats from the ridge after being overrun by the Japanese, Doss stays and continues to send down injured U.S. and enemy soldiers to the medics down below. Throughout the night, Doss rescued and securely lowered 75 soldiers without firing a weapon - the act of heroism that left his fellow soldiers (some of whom did not believe Doss should remain in the military) both shocked and amazed by his actions.\n\nObviously, a great film cannot be complete without a terrific lead and Andrew Garfield was fantastic. Receiving a nomination for his role, Mr. Garfield plays the hero perfectly. Doss is a kind but serious young man who puts himself before others while not resulting to violence. In one scene, Doss says he took the attack on Pearl Harbor personally. Yet throughout the film, he does not fire a weapon. A true hero who believed that he could win a war by sending wounded soldiers home instead of letting them die on the battlefield. This mindset is brought to life by Mr. Garfield's terrific performance. I hope he continues with his dramatic roles for the rest of his career and hopefully see him on that stage with an Oscar in his hand.\n\nSay what you want about Mel Gibson's personal life but \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is the director at his best. Bloody, violent, and relentless, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is one of the greatest war films ever made.\n\nGrade: A",

            "content": "Charging forth with a pacifist war story that's anything but passive, director Mel Gibson channels the vicious punch and visceral panache of some vaulted war films from H'Wood's past in telling the story of one very Brave Heart who's Passion for the Christ found him sticking to his religious, er, guns during one of World War II's deadliest skirmishes. \n\nIn this R-rated war movie, pacifist WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) refuses to kill people during the Battle of Okinawa and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot. Sporting a hard R rating, the film unapologetically pains a very bloody picture. Ironically and unsurprisingly skewing more toward the War is Hell mantra (made famous as the memoir title of another unlikely WWII underdog hero, Audie Murphy) than, say, one that proselytizes Peace is Heaven, this film's title says everything about its tone: Hacksaw Ridge. The ironic part arises from the fact that it's a story about pacifist convictions. The unsurprising part stems from the fact that it comes courtesy of a man made iconic by ultra-violent actioner Lethal Weapon, an artist who (kinda, sorta) also made 'historic' filmic violence iconic with Braveheart. To this end, there's two reasons why it wasn't titled The Desmond Doss Story. Due to the extreme but strategic use of violence, he film proves both a thoughtful rumination on the duality of man that's as much a statement by Gibson as Doss. For better and worse, Gibson zeroes in on two flicks for inspiration: Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan (All Quiet on the Western Front doubtlessly is another but many will miss the  connection given that, at 87 years old, that film as a cultural touchstone has timed out for anybody but film historians). The better? Hacksaw Ridge comes way closer than most to equaling the gut punch realism of these modern war classics, serving up a demoralizing boot camp segment that would make Jacket's R. Lee Emery's Drill Sgt. proud (Vince Vaughn, in a surprising but rewarding casting choice, believably doles out the vitriol) and setting the second half in an embattled Pacific warzone (amphibious landing, body count, jettisoned limbs, and all) that sometimes looks like Ryan Normandy Beach scenes picked up from the cutting room floor. The worse? The telltale stylistic beats 'borrowed' from these films can't be missed. Still, if Gibson hadn't already earned a place as a vaunted director with Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ, Hacksaw Ridge almost ensures him entry. The most expensive independent movie of all time (in his heyday, Gibson could get a Mother Theresa snuff film financed with one phone call but, post 2010 public meltdown amid a fickle film industry, he had to piece together financiers like a Shark Tank contestant) delivers a remarkable and well-shot true story. \n\nSticking to your guns - even when sticking to your guns specifically involves sticking to no guns - becomes more than a religious argument. It sets fire to a contentious conversation about a public trying to peacefully go about their day despite mass shootings being an almost weekly occurrence. Destined for Direct-to-Video status after The Amazing Spider-Man series toppled into oblivion, Andrew Garfield gives a layered and nuanced performance. It's not enough that he believably embodies the belief system of Desmond Doss's pacifist, he also looks and acts every bit like the simple - though not simpleton - farmer. As he's proven with Apocalypto and every film he's directed involving armed conflict (and, saved for Man Without a Face, they all do), Gibson puts forth a contemplative message saying peace is better than war but, ultimately, violence as an ends-to-a-means is often unavoidable ...or so it seems. Perhaps, the title of Lethal Weapon was simply hailing the coming of a cinematic realist. \n\nTo Sum it Up: Soldier of Good Fortune",

            "content": "Emphasis on the \"hack\".  If there is one thing Mel Gibson is not known for, it's subtlety. His films have never had a light touch, especially when it comes to his adored savior figures, and this movie is no exception. There is actually a pretty damn good war movie hidden in here... unfortunately, you have to sit through an hour of sap and melodrama to get to it. The problem with this film is that it's two films smashed together: one is a character drama about how saintly and pious Desmond Doss becomes saintly and pious, even in the army; and the other is a balls-out uber-violent bloodbath of a war movie. The first part sucks, the second is pretty awesome. So let's start with the first half - it is so unbelievably saccharine it made my teeth hurt. The protagonist is such a goddamn boy scout, the movie may as well have been called \"Mr. Smith Goes to War\".  Even the talented Andrew Garfield, who I am a big fan of, could not make him believable (luckily, in spite of this, Garfield's undeniable charisma makes us root for him anyway). And it's not just him, all the characters in this film suffer from two-dimensionality, and the film's cheeseball dialogue and dramatic swells of music don't help the situation. It's all so predictable. And then there is the sad, unforgivable imitation of Full Metal Jacket's infamous bootcamp scene, which was literally painful to watch. It's just offensive. By the midpoint, I was barely hanging on, trying to hold on to what little interest I had in this film and then HOLY SHIT IT'S A WAR MOVIE AAAAIIGHHHH!!! At that point, shit gets real, and fast. The juxtaposition of the horror, grit, and gore of this half with the sallow tepidness of the first is as shocking as a smack in the face. But at least the second half is effective. It's here that you really start to care about the characters, even the ones with very little screen time, which just shows that all the time spent up to that point was wasted on a back-story that wasn't important or necessary. Sadly, the film returns to its melodramatic roots at the end, which weakens the emotional punch of the second half and cheapens the story as a whole. And the story is a pretty amazing one, regardless of all the missteps in the telling, and one that really hits home when you see a few of the real-life interviews at the end (I wish there were more). I give the first half of this movie a D and the second a B+.",

However I was immensely affected by viewing this film even if on a TV screen.\nThe film is directed by Mel Gibson. A man who has directed several films already don't get me wrong but must be redeeming his faded reputation with work like this.\nThe screenplay importantly is about a conscientious objector Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield who I last saw in Martin Scorseses long winded Silence) who serves in the U.S. army in the Second World War on the gruesome battlefield of Hacksaw Ridge against the Japanese.\nDoss's is a highly religious man and his beliefs which he sticks to 'religiously' mean he faces training being unwilling to carry and use a gun.\nFor his beliefs Doss faces great unease from his comrades and senior officers who do everything in their power to make Doss quit service before active duty on the battlefield. Doss even facing a Court Martial at one stage.\nHowever Doss resolutely refuses to quit. His explanation being that he must 'serve' his country reeling from the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese.\nAll Doss wants to do is serve using his medical skills.\nSomehow Doss survives discharge and enters the battlefield at the Battle of Okinawa against the Japanese.\nThe battle scenes as the U.S. attempt to capture a ridge called Hacksaw Ridge are quite alarming in their brutality.\nI thought that the latest Rambo film was the most gory I have ever seen but think again.\nThe battlefield scenes make Saving Private Ryan (which I have watched in part) look like a tea party.\nI was quite alarmed by the brutality to be honest. However it brought the horrors of such fist to fist conflict (or gun and knife) home.\nDoss still refuses to even defend himself. I would not call it murder and at the start of the battle scenes I probably shared the rather Conservative views of the Officers that Doss service was more of a hinderance. Putting his comrades at risk.\nHowever Doss becomes an unlikely hero as he provides first aid to the wounded and single handedly rescues several (estimated at 75) to the relative safety behind the forefront of the battle lines.\nWe learn that Doss receives the greatest military honour that the U.S. awards the Medal of Honor.\nOld interview footage from the early 2000s interviews the original characters depicted in the film before their death.\nThe film making is top notch. I've already mentioned the Director but mention must also go to the cinematography and special effects department to make the battle scenes so horrifically realistic.\nMy own view of Doss changed like his comrades I suppose. From being totally questioning his (Doss) stubborn stance.\nThe film is more than your average depiction of the Second World War horrors but a biographical triumph.",

The first half is getting to know this guy, who he is, and why he is the way he is.  It plays off a little cheesy, and the romance comes off with him seeming like a bit of a creeper, but these almost seem like stylistic choices.  It gives it sort of a romanticized old-school Hollywood feeling.  It also creates a more dramatic contrast to the war scenes, and that's where this movie goes from pretty good to godamn genius.\nRight from the start of the war scenes, you feel the tension.  The way the tension works, building up a feeling of uneasiness that climaxes in moments of outrageous brutality, it's unlike any other war movie I've seen.  It doesn't even feel like a war movie, it feels more like a horror movie in it's style, pacing, and directing.  The scenes of them in the fog of climbing up the ridge to the battlefield are probably the films strongest moments.  The music and the directing just make the suspense of these people willingly going to a place where they are probably going to die downright unbearable.  And then there's the violence, oh the violence.  First of all, yes it's gory and horrible, but based on what I've heard from real vets about our war movies it probably still doesn't reach the whole thing.  Second, a lot of people say the violence is romanticized and takes away from the movies message of peace.  Maybe they were watching a different movie, because I don't see that at all.  The violence isn't glorified, it's horrified.  It doesn't show the glory in taking lives, but rather the glory in saving lives, which was the what our lead characters whole deal was, a pacifist in war who just wanted to save lives in a time when people were purely focused on taking them.  It works really well, and it's point is made clear.  It doesn't demonize the effects of war and the soldiers who are actually fighting either though, it just shows that the reality that exists. It's powerfully effective and for a war film manages to get by without any real villain, aside from the very concept of conflict I guess.\nIn my first viewing of this movie, I had my problems with the earlier scenes.  They were a little too whimsical and exaggerated for my liking.  Now having seen the whole film, I understand their purpose to put you in a head-space where the films point can truly come across.  It's a damn powerful movie, one of the best war movies I've ever seen.  Extremely effective and highly engaging, it's a near-masterpiece.",

This makes me think that watching a documentary about Desmond Doss would be much more engaging and rewarding than this over rated movie (I say that as a Mel Gibson fan) The first hour of the movie is about Desmond Doss's home life and it is super cheesy and predictable to the point of being almost 2 dimensional. The story arch's of the characters are linear and predictable also. The second hour of the movie is about Desmond Doss's military achievement. This really saves the movie and makes it worth while but there are still unsatisfactory elements. I think this movie was badly cast. Some of the acting is really awful and some of the actors did not suit their roles. The dialouge is also predictable and cheesy at times. The realities of war and the unique story of Desmond Doss are enough to hold this story together as an etertainment spectacle however the movie itself is grossly over rated.",

He goes into battle as a medic and only wants to save people. If you think Mel Gibson may have softened up a little bit after being away for a while, I would think again if I were you. The battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge are among the most intense and graphic captured on film. Arguably one upping the infamous D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan.

His road to the battlefield to serve as a medic is filled with hate and bullying but you already know he will get his \"revenge\" and stand as the true hero in the end.\n\nPlenty of war-action but also a solid background story - the balance is just fine. Some silly war scenes and I never like the bible stuff. The praying scene is pretty dumb, some other scenes are also a bit sketchy. When he is towed down and it oozes of CGI and some angel infused message I felt it was a bit too much. The mix of ethics of war and religion never favor the film, really. I never really like the area where the battles takes place either. Climbing the net, knowing there will be loads of Japanese there - it's like a neverending computer game. I doubt it was like that in reality, but I believe the producers choice of making something special of it was a cool idea that almost worked out.\n\nIt takes well care of the viewer. It's never flat or boring, never dragged out and rearly too silly. Not the deepest of films, but it works out as a entertaining piece. Well acted, even Vince Vaughn impresses me. It's lovely shot, without trying to be too fancy. Ugly enough action combined with typical Oscar material works out. Not seen many of the Oscar participants yet, but I believe it won't win more than one award.\n\n6.5 out of 10 morphine shots.",

The filmmakers brilliantly brought the story of a WWII soldier that saved countless lives, both good and bad, without the need of killing or the use of a gun. It's inspiring and fascinating to know that a story like this actually happened. The gore and violence might be a bit troublesome for those who have a soft heart, but the journey to get to end will be satisfying. Thank you, Medic Officer Doss for your courage in saving those men.",

This movie is based on a true story about, a man named Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) who is serving in WW2, but he doesn't want to touch a weapon. So he goes on to the battlefield against the Japanese with no gun. His intention is to save peoples lives. Not since Saving Private Ryan have we got a war film that is so emotionally captivating. From the opening scene, I knew that this movie was going to have something special, and it did. I was floored by Hacksaw Ridge. There was not a single thing wrong with it. Everyone who played in it did a remarkable. Mel Gibson is back at it again with another good movie. This is proof that Gibson still has it. The war scenes were well choreographed, and violent. I hate it when people say \"Its too gory\". It's WW2, what else would you expect? What got me was watching this character achieving what he intended to do. It almost brought me to tears. At one point, I thought that I was going to cry because the movie was that good.\nOver all, this film was remarkable. It is sure to be a classic in the future. 5/5 stars",

I wish there were more interpersonal struggles between characters and more time spent on his recusing all those people from the ridge such as more close calls with the opposing side and more perilous situations like when he went into that cave system. I didn't really connect with the characters of the other soldiers either even the main side soldier character who died before getting to the edge of the ridge. What I liked least about the movie, however, was who was cast as the main character. Sure he had had a go at the Virginia accent and Bible talk but he is so obnoxious to look at.

Some takes on it-and more so, certain elements encapsulated within those views-are likely philosophically self-reverential and a demonstration of current modern angst toward what those individuals may term as traditionalism, but I see the film's structure and character development rather differently.\n\nDoes the director (Mel Gibson) use a hand that is too heavy in any way?  I do not believe so at all.  Filmmakers the likes of Oliver Stone and James Cameron tend to bludgeon one over the head.  Mr. Gibson is not really of the same cloth.  While in Hacksaw Ridge he was clearly acknowledging that what Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) did was miraculous in and of itself, he was also allowing for the view that Mr. Doss himself had toward prayer, faith and divinity.  Such was clearly part of the man and the film is simply being honest in presenting that.  The viewer may take from it what the viewer will, but I say HACKSAW RIDGE is an excellent example of exemplary film-making.\n\nMy father was a Marine and Okinawa was the location of his deployment.  He was seriously wounded there and wasn't expected to live, but he did.  Then he wasn't expected to walk again, but he did.  He then went on to live a life of hard physical labor.  He was a man whom I will always hold in deep love and respect.  When I was a small child I used touch his wounds--which were all over his stomach, side, lower back and buttocks--and ask what they were.  He would just tell me that they were wounds from a war.  When I got older he described circumstances on Okinawa to me in more detail (though he was never verbose about it) and they were strikingly similar to those depicted in HACKSAW RIDGE.\n\nThe movie is certainly not easy to watch at times, but it is quite thought-provoking and most affecting.  And those who know of the situation on that island at that time will find it quite realistic.",

Andrew Garfield is unforgettable in the role of Desmond Doss and Mel Gibson does an amazing job at directing this film. During the sequences where the American soldiers are at war with the Japanese during the Battle Of Okinawa, you practically feel like you're about to cry when seeing the cost on humans war has. Kinda like the Netflix movie Beasts of No Nation in some respects. Every time, your heart pounds as you want Doss to save as many soldiers as he can even saving some wounded Japanese soldiers. This demonstrates that wanting to be a medic shouldn't be limited to only select races. Everyone deserves a second chance in life even if they were monsters. So, what's the short version of my review on Hacksaw Ridge? Answer: A solidly acted and well-made film which does a great job of focusing on religious themes, predominantly the sixth commandment: \"Thou shalt not kill\".",

This is in  contrast to Eastwood's Letters to Iwo Jima which offers more substance and less filler. All the same, it's an absolute must see for war picture advocates.

But, I decided perhaps he has atoned for his drunken tirade and his movies need not be boycotted by me any longer.  Plus, I like a good war flick.  The story itself is undeniably compelling and frankly miraculous.  What the man achieved on his own and how he stuck to his beliefs are made for Hollywood - if it was written nobody would believe it.  And I feel like that's where the movie misses the mark - even with the graphic, visceral war scenes, this movie feels like a it's shot on a soundstage.  It didn't transport me to Okinawa the way Saving Private Ryan took us along on D-Day.  The casting of Vince Vaughn as the Sarge and Hugo Wallace Weaving as the protagonist's father are curious choices.  Perhaps it was simply a matter of who is willing to work with Mr. Gibson.  The movie spends a lot of time pre-battle establishing the backstory that formed the beliefs and character of Desmond Doss.  Kind of snoozy but the lading lady Teresa Palmer is a compelling actress and easy on the eyes, and she basically carries the first half of the film. The second half chronicles the bravery of Desmond in the heat of a ferocious battle with Japanese soldiers who are literally dug in on top of Hacksaw Ridge.  Where it's supposed to be fear inducing and intense, it feels like the foxholes are on the backlot.  It's a true story - so there are inherent challenges in sticking to a true story.  Using Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now as the gold standard of war films, and Saving Private Ryan as Silver (loosely based on a true story), I'd give this a bronze in the war film category.  As a true war story, which is its own category, it's very good, most importantly for putting the spotlight on one man's incredible bravery and service to his fellow comrades in the face of grave danger, a feat worth honoring and remembering.",

His latest feature is a beautiful outing that proves that all a faith-based film needs to work for everyone, religious or not, is a sense of heart and a general respect towards universal human values. Through thick and thin, Desmond Doss perseveres with every fiber of his being: in his case, it's faith that guides him in particular, but it shows that just caring about our fellow humans really can make a difference. So much of why Doss works as a character is the way Andrew Garfield portrays him: with a heavy Virginian accent and a boyish charm, he's an immediately loveable soul, and you immediately relate to his unfaltering desire to \"save one more.\" This is far and away some of Garfield's finest work as an actor. Gibson himself proves that not even a decade long hiatus has weakened his sensibilities as a director. The juxtaposition of a faith-based story against the sheer brutality of World War II is almost poetic, all without the violence ever seeming gratuitous. The battle sequences in the second half are certainly gruesome (the squeamish should probably avoid this one), but it never feels like it's there for shock value or to try to push boundaries of how graphic a film can get: it's simply an extension of the themes of this utterly beautiful story of the human spirit.",

When you think about a direct relationship between The Passion of Christ, Braveheart and Apocalypto is not only about the violence itself, but about the connection between faith, freedom, will during extreme circumtances.\n\nDesmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) grown in Lynchburg, Virginia becomes a pacifist after a traumatic event which almost make his brother kill. The experience drive him to believe in a non violence attitude, after years witnessing the abuse of his father Tom Doss (Hugo Weaving) against his mother he consider that he is the right path to follow.\n\nLater he decided to enlist inn the army, brining this controversial beliefs causing hate, disrespect and also court martial from his colleagues in the Army. The case was dismiss after his father prove that Doss is protected by an Act of Congress by been a pacifist. \n\nDoss goes to Okinawa with the 77th Infantry Division without a weapon, just to help in the medical area. \n\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\" is Mel Gibson's most recent film about the life Desmond Doss, the movie contains one of the most impressive actions scenes, but also the most brutal and gory. The film explores the irony of war and violence while you having the most peaceful person in it. Every time you see a major character been hurt or killed Gibson sends you a message that nothing is for granted, when it comes to the act of war. The violence in \"Hacksaw Ridge\" borderline in Quentin Tarantino, where caricatures-cue blood and action becomes an ode to thirsty audience who just want to see everyone been blown away or hurt really bad. Gibson explore those acts of violence and make you understand about the ramifications of defend your honor besides your beliefs. The movie also borderline into the corny from Desmond love story to his relationship with his family.  \n\nThe cast do a formidable job and the film is visually stunning, with amazing technical achievements in sound, cinematography and post production",

Gibson has a thing with gore, his The Passion Of The Christ (2004) also dealt with a lot of blood and pain, same thing we saw in Hacksaw Ridge, both were great films in its respected area, so I think, gore is what his signature style should be 'cause he's good at it.\n\nThe movie is a decent retelling of one of the most heartfelt and incredible stories during the WWII, the part I'm looking forward to see is Doss saying these words: \"Please Lord, help me get one more.

I suppose 10 years in movie-making exile is where antisemitic rants gets you in Hollywood. That aside, it's a pleasure to see Gibson directing again as he often delivers big, entertaining spectacles and his latest certainly falls into line with that.\n\nPlot: The true story of private Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) who joins the army during WWII but refuses to bear arms due to being a conscientious objector. At the battle of Okinawa, Doss serves as a medic, saving numerous lives and becomes the first man in history to win a Medal of Honor without ever firing a gun. \n\nIf you consider the material of Hacksaw Ridge, you might notice that's it ripe material for Mel Gibson and his personal beliefs. As a man who has\nbeen very outspoken (a bit too much) on his Christian values, this film seems like the perfect vehicle for him to channel these beliefs. Faith and religion course throughout this and, as much as you can may want to overlook it, it just won't let you. This is a film about a saviour and it can't help but bombard you with religious rhetoric and imagery. In the end, you could ask where God is in all this bloodshed and mayhem but that might be a tad too philosophical for what Gibson is going for here.\n\nSadly, that's what's missing from Hacksaw Ridge; Its jingoism feels out of touch and I couldn't help but wonder what, say, Terrence Malick might have done with the material. If you consider Malick's The Thin Red Line, for example, you'll find a philosophical depth that's lacking from Gibson's film yet it would have benefited greatly from.\n\nThere's also a contradictory nature; Despite feeling like an old-fashioned, Hollywood style picture it has many riffs and rip-off's of contemporary war movies. There are several unashamed nods to Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan and Gibson's own Braveheart and Hacksaw's major problem is that it doesn't come close to bettering any of them.\n\nI'm also not sold on the choice of leading man; Andrew Garfield is not a bad actor by any means but he doesn't deliver a performance that's worthy of the Oscar nomination he's received for this. I don't know, maybe it's just his appearance that throws me off. He's too boyish or maybe it's just that I can't help but focus on how disproportionate his hair is to his face. It's not the first time in a film that I've noticed his monumentally large hair. It's very distracting.\n\nThat said, despite its cliches and sometimes woefully written dialogue, this still has much to offer in terms of entertainment and it's a pleasure to see Gibson calling the shots with his usual visceral approach. He still has a ferocious ability to stage a good action set-piece and Hacksaw provides a good number of them.\n\nAlthough old sugar tits just can't help but put his Christian values and themes of religious devotion into this, it's hard not to be swept up in the combat and the man behind the astounding true story. It's not subtle storytelling from Gibson but it's simple and effective nonetheless.\n\nMark Walker",

A faith which supposedly prevents him from touching a gun. Funny how this doesn't stop millions of other Christians from doing so. \nI understand that this really is based on a true story, but the movie is still incredibly manipulative in how it tells the tale. It's full of classic war movie cliches, and corny stereotypes.\nAnd why the hell is Vince Vaughn in this?! Like, WTF? As the drill sergeant, no less. It just makes it feel like we are suddenly in a comedy or something. Terrible choice of actor there. \nOverall, this is a very mediocre war movie, with lots of violence, about a real person who did real heroic things.

            "content": "Typical of Mel Gibson to allow his over-the-top handling to ruin a great story. \nKey facts and events are changed to the point that Desmond Doss becomes little more than a caricature of the real man.  You can argue that many details are \"irrelevant\" and giving them the hollywood treatment makes for a better movie experience, but for me it was unnecessary - and even, in some cases to the detriment of Doss' well deserved legend.  For example, after 12 hours rescuing some 50-75 men, he is ultimately blown up by a grenade from which he saved his comrades, but then - riddled with shrapnel - he still crawled off his stretcher and gave it up to another injured man, in the process having his arm shattered by sniper fire.  This is cut out and should have been the icing on the cake.  Yet somehow Gibson decided this was unimportant? Why? Quite clearly he wants to present what happened to Doss as a genuine real-life miracle - no question Doss survived 12 hours under heavy fire and was able to rescue half of his platoon single-handed without injury which is borderline miraculous.  But the fact that he subsequently was blown up by a grenade and then shot renders him \"only human\" and diminishes Gibson's \"miracle man\" vision, which I think is unforgivable on Gibson's part.\nDoss' true life story is one of immense human courage, and the fact that he paid a hard price for it only increases his legend in my eyes.  Gibson in his religious fervour short changes us and Doss.  \nMoving in parts and I am grateful for being introduced to Doss' story as it is incredible - but for me it fails, revelling in the current trend for \"alternate facts\" which apparently are always better than the truth - as long as they serve your agenda.",

This film disturbed me, haunted me, and sent shivers down my spine during its many lengthy battle sequences, which were shot with gruesome realism and likened to that of a horror movie with heavy emphasis on the expression: war is hell. The story follows real-life army medic, Desmond Doss, who was a conscientious objector to violence due to some elements of his past, and through faith and unwavering courage, decides to enlist in the army to save lives, rather than take them. His journey takes him to the infamous battle of Okinawa, where the Americans fought the ruthless Japanese soldiers and though many lives were lost, Desmond managed to save approximately 75 wounded soldiers without firing a single bullet. Andrew Garfield gives the performance of his career as Doss, a simple-minded, but determined-as-hell lover, rather than fighter, whose spirituality gets him through his considerable obstacles in the army. He is ridiculed, beaten, and named a coward for his non-violent tendencies, leading to harsh treatment from his peers throughout boot camp. The supporting cast is also excellent here with Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey giving career-best performances as fellow soldiers, and a nearly unrecognizable Hugo Weaving was OUTSTANDING as Desmond's alcoholic veteran father; whose biggest fear is having his sons buried before him. All that said, Mel Gibson is the true star of the show here and it is wonderful to see him being embraced back into the public consciousness thanks to this incredibly powerful and assured film. Hacksaw Ridge is the best war film since Saving Private Ryan, and the impact this film carries left me in complete, stunned silence once it ended.",

The cinematography, the script, the cast, the performances, and the score was just superb. The only thing I regret is not catching this film at an Atmos theater - OMG it sounds so AMAZING. Bombardments were heavy and loud, gave me new sub an amazing workout - WOW!!! I can see now why this movie won an academy for sound and rightfully so and well deserved. Simply excellent!!! Some may say it was too violent, too extreme or too gruesome, but it's war and nothing in the battlefield is anything less so I was okay with it. Definitely not for the faint of heart. I gotta say Mel Gibson knocked this one out the park. I had my doubts when I heard Mel to maybe direct the Suicide Sequel, I said \"NOOOO\" - I take that back let him direct it.
