When strange apparitions appear in Manhattan, Gilbert and Yates turn to engineer Jillian Holtzmann for help. Also joining the team is Patty Tolan, a lifelong New Yorker who knows the city inside and out. Armed with proton packs and plenty of attitude, the four women prepare for an epic battle as more than 1,000 mischievous ghouls descend on Times Square.",

So I was indeed happy to be seeing the franchise back on the screen again with this remake. I've come to learn that similar to the original movie, this remake has an SNL-filled cast as well. Some of the comedic gags are far too silly especially with Chris Hemsworth, but there are enough laughs to keep the movie going. Of course, it can be criticised that the plot is far too similar to the original and hardly brings anything new, but I still feel like giving it a free pass just for being able to see more ghost-busting action once again.",

Out of all the new characters, Patricia is the only interesting one, and provides the only jokes that didn't have awful deliveries and weren't just pure cringe, and Jillian was the only other one I could stand although she wasn't that special and just a character trope of the awkward talker. The only interesting idea this film explores is the battle for not just being taken as Frauds or Hoaxes, but it gets overplayed and boring by the end. Overall, not worth a watch as everything about this film is inferior and lazy, like even the Ecto-1 looks so much worse (even if that is just a nit-pick).",

The remake, GB: Afterlife, was fresh, creative, entirely original, and the story-line throughout was the most entertaining part, much more so than after the introduction of the 'not-man / not-woman', god, who seemed after being freed from years of captivity, to want to sit between 'its' two gatekeepers, and perhaps postulate what now, to do.

Known now as The Female Ghostbusters, because really that's what it is, a cheap attempt to capitalize on diehard fans of the franchise, where their only attempt of input of a new idea was to say \"so how about we take all the characters and make them women? \", and then executive turned their heads and said\" Brilliant, give this person a medal and a cookie. \"\n\nThis movie even led me to coin in my vocabulary what I would call \"The Ghostbusters Effect (2016)\", an effect that although I had already seen it many times before, I had never been so disgusted as with this film, that's why it deserves to be named after it.\n\n\"The Ghostbusters Effect (2016)\" I describe it vaguely as the need for studios to quickly and cheaply capitalize on past glories, trampling on the years it took for an original IP to build a legacy that has lasted decades, this through a remake, reboot or pseudo-sequel, where generally the people in charge of creating the magic that would bring the original to life are not involved in the project, and where a pretentious director / director, writers, believe they are literally correcting the story. Where are you people do not have the humility to recognize that they are standing on the shoulders of giants, people who with nothing more than a vague idea and a lot of talent and creativity managed to create something memorable and that would become part of popular culture, and where are you people They don't have the slightest idea of \u200b\u200bwhat made that story, that idea, that memorable and endearing franchise in the first place. And above all the hypocrisy of the exploitation of the fans of yesteryear, who first desperately try to appeal to them, but the moment they see through their facade of smoke and mirrors, and reject the product, they turn against them, attacking them and trying to shame them looking for the grossest excuses to justify their failed project, their failed scam, and that is that the fan does not know exactly what he wants, but he knows what is good when he sees it, and he also knows how to identify a impostor, to a wannabe when he wants to present himself to be the new replacement, in addition to presenting himself as the \"new and improved\" way, saying \"I've come to correct everything, look at me, I'm better\", and if the fan doesn't like it, the Creators, directors and actors will call fans back for not liking it (true story), creating this environment where instead of the product being worthy enough for the viewer to invest their hard-earned money and take ho irreplaceable ras of his life in it, now the fan must be worthy enough to see his movie (true story). That and more is what I vaguely describe as \"The Ghostbusters Effect (2016)\".\n\nThere is not much to add about the movie itself, it is an imitation of the original, with a genderswap (gender change), where they wanted to take the archetype of each character, \"deconstruct them\" and make them \"funny\", although the comedy here seems written by a child, a child not at all funny, who may not have many friends, as it seems that he does not understand what human interaction is like and subsequently, does not understand what is funny and what is not. The story is an amalgamation (not to say that they took film 1 and 2, ate it and vomited it) of the two original films, but delivering a completely inferior product, where there is also a clear very marked inclination of identity politics, For those who have seen it, they will already know what I mean, a little formula that has been repeated a lot in all films of this type in recent years. And not to mention the protagonists, in themselves noneShe delivers a good performance, and none of them have a gram of comedy in them, especially Melissa McCarthy, I don't like her pseudo-comedy, but still, they want to get her into this kind of thing, with Kristen Wiig I have no major problem, In this genre it has always been made to me as a passive punching bag, it receives jokes, but does not give them, and here it is no exception, and the other two actresses, I do not know who they were and I have no intention of seeing them in anything else , the same, an exaggeration of the characters that they are supposed to want to be. And well Chris Hemsworth only comes out because you have to put a AAA star that attracts people who do not know what Ghostbusters is and know him for Thor. And not to mention the \"cameos\" of the main characters, I can only say that it clearly represents what this movie is.\n\nI can only say stay away from the movie at all costs if you haven't seen it yet, take a better look at the originals if you really want to experience Ghostbusters.\n\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e",

Instead of focusing on the story of forming this group of people into Ghostbusters, this reboot instead lets the comedy take centre stage, pushing the story and logic to the side where it just brushes over certain details and moves far too quickly to get invested.\n\nThe intentions of rebooting a beloved classic is to improve on aspects as the time has passed, Ghostbusters (2016) establishes that this is truly a reboot as the knowledge of ghosts is unknown, however this film can't hold back from standing on its own and instead draws in ridiculously out-of-place Easter eggs and cameos just for fan service.\n\nThis film is disgraceful standing alongside the original, as it contains some horrific writing and jokes which are painfully awful.",

I don't think this story would have been significantly different had they acknowledged that the Manhattan cross rip and Vigo and the OG Ghostbusters had existed. If anything, there are a thousand ways you could have explained how Ghostbusters was now a franchised business that would have kept this movie squarely focused on Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and the comedically immortal Kate McKinnon who is absolutely a national treasure and far and away my favorite character in this film. The cut-for-time dance number at the end was questionable but at the same time, we're watching a movie about four people who go into business catching ghosts. I think if we're going to suspend disbelief, we need to suspend all the way.\n\nI think this is one of those movies that under different circumstances might have found its footing and done quite well but I also think that the two things that conspired against it were insurmountable: 1) they ignored the original continuity 2) through no fault of their own, they became a proxy for the battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016 - which was a total bummer. Ultimately, I would love to have seen more of these characters and I left the theater happy with the experience even though not in the way I wanted. Ultimately though, life is full of moments like that and they tend to lead to new experiences that will sometimes produce memories and moments you'll enjoy more as an adult since the things that inspired you as a kid rarely do when you're grown.

            "content": "Ghostbusters is a reboot of the old classic films Ghostbusters 1984/89 films with unimaginable, for that time, special effects play their role. What can not be said about the new film.\n\nDespite the public's love for various scandalous showdowns, thanks to which the Sony Pictures film company has successfully promoted its products more than once. But in this case, this technique failed and the wheel of repression, which the company swept over the original director Ivan Reitman, met with an extremely negative reaction and rebuff from the fans, who not only considered the replacement of Reitman with Paul Fig unequal, but already spread waves of hatred towards him in advance. Not yet released film. The gender reassignment of the main characters only added fuel to the fire and the flames consumed the entire creative process, and constant criticism of a dark cloud hung over the creators, which eventually led to failure\n\nDespite the opposite opinions about the film, the truth, as usual, is somewhere between an angel and a devil - in the middle. Moving away from all the scandals, discarding the unpopular decision to change the sex of the heroes, finally forgetting the original - you can make up your own, still extremely subjective opinion.\n\nThe plot of the reboot duplicates the original and tells us about how four partners decided to start hunting the evil spirits that appeared on the streets of New York. Naturally, the first thing for newly minted ghost hunters is a powerful spirit who decides to destroy all life on Earth. Yes, it will not do without the Marshmallow Man, whose appearance in the film finally convinced the writers of the complete creative impotence.\n\nI consider Paul Feig to be a mediocre director, no film of which falls short of the \"good\" bar, but hangs somewhere in the lower end of the rating scale. Weak in all respects, both in the work with the staff and in the interaction with the scenery. But he still shot several high-profile hits starring Melissa McCarthy. This madame is the owner of dubious acting data, but is in the center of the artificially created hype around her person. The only remarkable feature of her image is speculation on the topic of excess weight - always, everywhere and in everything.\n\nChris Hemsworth once again proved that Hollywood does not need him outside the image of the god of thunder. It represents the director's taunting of men, which, again, is very strange. Paul is personally responsible for gender changes, citing past difficulties in communicating with his gender (according to his stories, he was often bullied from time to time). The contradiction lies in the fact that Feig endowed the main characters with masculine qualities, and concentrated stereotypes about female behavior in Hemsworth's character, thereby recognizing the superiority of the stronger sex, and humiliating the female part of the planet's population. But let's leave this topic, especially since this is not the most nightmare in the film.\n\nChildren's dialogues. Only these children speak scientific and pseudo-scientific words so that we think that the main characters are very smart people. But this feeling immediately disappears, and lucky those who have it at all, because their statements are ridiculously implausible.\n\nSince this is a comedy, by definition, there should be jokes in it - it should be funny for us, but the \"jokes\" from this movie literally make you sick: Vomiting, mucus of unknown origin, inappropriate sounds, etc. Plus, there are a lot of vulgar jokes that are either simply stupid or non-aesthetic. No, there are positive aspects, but they are completely inappropriate and are more suitable for youth comedies. Self-irony is present, so it was very helpful and, in some places, sounded funny.\n\nPaul Feig crossed out with a bold line everything for which the original dilogy was so loved. Unfunny jokes, actresses' antics, unconvincing computer graphics, stingy production, excessively rapid development of the plot - only for this one can already hate the film. But the director didn't think this was enough, and already from his side, insults and accusations poured down towards the audience.\n\nThe special effects are one big flop, because with the $ 144 million budget, they could have been made more believable. There are certain colors - these are blue and green, of which there are a lot that hurts the eyes. There is no feeling of complete immersion.\n\nIf the original \"Ghostbusters\" was a harmonious and graceful combination of a comedy and a mystical thriller and adventure, where humor ingeniously complemented and adorned an already interesting and exciting story, then in the new film the opposite is true. The authors supposedly did everything so that all the recognizable symbolism, including the ghost story itself, became just an excuse for the implementation of as many different gags as possible, when, on the contrary, the plot requires capturing attention in this case, and humor should be beneficial to this.\n\nThere are enough actors of the first magnitude who are not clear for what reasons generally agreed to star in this film.\n\nThey chose the format of the purest comedy with not a small amount of absurdity, due to which the action itself sometimes tends to the absurd and is perceived almost on the verge of parody.\n\nIt feels like the authors of the picture just needed money and they had a creative crisis, since they could not come up with something new and interesting.\n\nThe most interesting thing is that I was not negatively disposed before watching the film, all this is simply striking from the first minutes.\n\nNew time, new team. It would be nice, you know, if the creators showed how the new generation replaces the old one. How old people pass the baton to new heroes, how accumulated knowledge and the burden of responsibility are passed from one generation to the next, well, like in the good animated series 'Extreme Ghostbusters'. It would be cool, right?\n\nUndoubtedly, the original Ghostbusters was a comedy, but there was a little bit of everything mixed in there. There was mysticism, horror, fantasy, and humor. This is what the film won over us.\n\nHere, the emphasis is on the incessant moronic gags, which ceased to be funny 20 years ago.\n\nWell, you know. The woman is screaming loudly, her eyes are bunching up - this is ridiculous? The woman was given a kick - it's ridiculous? The woman fell to the floor - it's ridiculous? The woman was doused with rubbish from the garbage - this is funny? And etc. What? Not funny for you? Then you are a misogynist, my friend, however, more on that later.\n\nThere are no horrors or mystics here. Just stupid gags and cartoony, which is multiplied by the presence of multi-colored neon ghosts in the frame. They wanted to make Colombo, but did Ace Ventura.\n\nThe level of humor. If in 2016 you are still amused by farting jokes, then yes, the movie is for you. The rest I hasten to disappoint - the bubonic plague is funnier than this movie.\n\nWhen the guy said 'Suck it!' and began to shake the middle finger in front of the heroines' noses. How funny it can be. It's funny if you imagine a picture of an adult filmaker who sitting and coming up with this scene for a movie.\n\nIf in the original film we had Bill Murray lying on the floor in slime after being attacked by Slimer, here in our frame right in the frame a ghost opens its mouth and vomits on the main character - is it funny? This is exactly what jokes evolved into in this Ghostbusters.\n\nReferences to the original. Rather parasitism on the original. The actors of the original were shoved into the film, giving them completely different roles. There is also a cameo of the building where the former Ghostbusters worked. So the movie kind of says, 'See? This is a reboot of the Ghostbusters, not a second-rate fart comedy set in a classic movie! '\n\nCharacters. Having narrowed down the general atmosphere of the film, the authors also rounded up the characters. Just to note with the relative comicity, in the old 2 films, people were people.\n\nHere we have every character - that is elevated to the absolute clich\u00e9.\n\nThe villain is just a something unexplainable. What wrong has the whole world done to him? How did he get all this power? He literally dealt with the faceless NPCs with a wave of his hand, but could not repeat the same trick against the heroines? I think I'm looking for logic in the wrong movie...\n\nMisogyny. The filmmakers deny that if you don't like the film, you're a dumb bumpkin and sexist. Is it now that they justify not succesful and shitty films? Think about it: a film in which women are portrayed with clumsy shrill stereotypes - if you don't like it, then you are a misogynist, and you don't like women.\n\nNo, gentlemen, creators. You made the nonsense, and you still have the audacity to hide behind screams about misogynists in order to create at least some hype around the film, which in fact is not worth a damn.\n\nDo you know what is most interesting? Professional and incorruptible critics who scolded Warcraft, but at the same time praised this humus. The bottom line? The film, made by the director-fan of the video game, which was overseen by Blizzard himself, has a lower performance than the remake of this Ghostbusters, made by the director of comedies about clumsy fat women.",

Although it frustrated me to no end that practically every decent enough idea fell through, mostly because of the refusal of Bill Murray.  However, when we finally heard that a spin-off/reboot of Ghostbusters was happening, I figured it was the best we were going to get for now.  \n\nI know that many people were not thrilled about the idea of an all-female team of Ghostbusters, but I didn't mind the idea.  I went into the movie with an open mind.  While the story was not too bad, the ending of the movie wasn't really the best in my opinion, having the antagonist's (I GUESS you could call it a) \"destructor form\" be the ghost from the logo.  And I know that Chris Hemsworth has been improving his comedy chops more and more, but in this movie, it just didn't feel right to me.  Seeing Thor act like a completely airheaded jock?  Meh, not my thing.  \n\nThe special effects, while pretty, felt like there was too much of it.  Now I understand what Bill Murray hated about Ghostbusters 2 (he supposedly hated that there were far too many visual effects).  Especially towards the end.  I primarily liked the look of Slimer in the original movies when he was made via practical effects.  And speaking of whom, Slimer...with a girlfriend?  Yeah...NO.  \n\nDespite that, my overall opinion of it is that while it's DEFINITELY not as good as the first two movies, it's not a complete bomb of a film.  I do give credit to the cast and crew because it's a fun movie on it's own.  I just don't think it matches up as well with the original films.",

Also the jokes were more random and didn't have the same comedic value because the chemistry between the characters was bad. The antagonist was so boring to watch being between cheesy and creepy I didn't know if I should take him seriously or comedically, they set up a backstory that was meant to make him seem like a feel bad character but then replaced him with Chris Hemsworth. Then they just stole the final act of pixels. Guys if you want to reboot a franchise or start a new one you have to add quality. The audience isn't that stupid and it makes me feel stupid as I was watching it. I hope the cast can get another chance at a good movie together because they are very talented and deserve it.

I have disdain for the disrespect to the original by erasing it with this story. Ghostbusters is a timeless gem and deserves better than to be cast aside just for a gender swap. Finally, here's a question...Is it more misogynistic to do a gender swap for the sake of a gender swap or develop new content with female characters in mind? Hmmm.",

If, for some reason, anyone actually liked this movie enough to bring their kid, they would have to wait until they're comfortable with that kind of humor. Definitely not a family movie like the original, which goes to show you that you can have genuinely funny humor in a movie and not try to rely on questionable material. Don't think I'm a prude. I own 2 Eddie Murphy stand-up movies. Ghostbuster 2016 just isn't funny. I blame the writers for most of it because I actually like Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon.

Now, to review this film on its own merits. I didn't hate nor love this movie. I've never been a big fan of Melissa McCarthy's style of comedy (Spy is awesome). I think of her comedic sensibilities are comparable to Will Ferrell (which I'm not a huge fan of his comedies either). That style of comedy just didn't work very well for me in this movie. I know that I'm judging this film on it on merits but, it didn't really seem to take the subject matter and it's people as serious as the original it. Taking the seriousness of your subject matter could really elevate the comedy elements to hysterical proportions. Just felt that they spend a lot of time trying to build up to these comedic side pieces that just absolutely fell flat and lifeless. My last and biggest gripe with the film, the betrayal of the characters. Almost everyone in this movie is a stereotype. Do you have everyone dialed up to 1000 in their characters. Do you have characters acting like a straight buffoon and other characters are what Hollywood thinks scientists are (much like what the producers of the big bang theory think geek culture is like). \n\nThere were some redeeming qualities that this film. The two actors that stick out in a positive way, if you call it that, are Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth. They are the bright spot because their characters are so extreme that it breaks the established stereotypes and it just becomes down right ridiculously comical. The updated VFXs looked great. This allowed the Ghostbusters more freedom in their actions. Personally the ghosts looked strikingly beautiful. Yes, they have more of a whimsical look but, when you are primarily a comedy first, that is not such a bad thing. The action set pieces in the final act were actually pretty entertaining to watch as well. Overall, this movie was a generic, lifeless and somewhat entertaining ride. If this movies on in the background, I would be OK with it. I also wouldn't be surprised if I would fast forward it to the last act.",

If you can't get past that part then you're going to experience a major problem.  The movie is heavily referential to the original Ghostbusters movies whether it be characters, locations, or plot points and these will certainly feel like a direct attack on your loving memories of the franchise.  I can't help shake the feeling that if the movie hadn't leaned on references so heavily, and focused on being movie set in the Ghostbusters universe movie rather than a reboot of a franchise, it would have been received in a much more positive way by the fans.\n\nThat being said, there's also good things here.   The cast and crew obviously care about the movie so noone's phoning anything in.  That provides just enough charm to allow you to overlook disjointed inclusions or the occasional over-the-top performance that doesn't quite fit.  The cast is funny when the script allows them to be and the bright and colorful ghosts provide a relatively cheerful movie for a ghost story. \n\nIt's not going to blow anyone's socks off and it's got some obvious issues but it's an entertaining, if somewhat forgettable, popcorn flick in its own right. \n\nAnd you know what?  If you're willing to let this movie just be what it is then it's enough.  Grab some snacks, don't overthink anything and have a laugh.",

He's probably one of the best dressed directors working in Hollywood today. I don't know why he didn't win an Academy Award for his attire.

            "content": "Point of order before I get into this review, I would be not be doing this review justice without briefly giving you a rundown of my status as a Ghostbusters super fan. I had the first movie memorized completely at the age of 5, I've seen every episode of both Ghostbusters tv shows at least twice and I built a 98% screen accurate proton pack prop complete with both lights and sound. So yes, I'm a super fan and yes, I've been one of those internet guys who have not been a fan of the production and promotion leading up to the release of this film. That's also why I have waited so long to see the movie, and even longer to write the review. I didn't want my displeasure with the production to unfairly color my view. Now that I feel I am fully composed, this is my review for Ghostbusters 2016.\n\nThis new version of everyone's favorite paranormal eliminators is actually a remake that takes place in a universe where nobody knows who to call when there's something strange in the neighborhood. The movie has Bridesmaids stars Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig reuniting along with other SNL alumni in Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones as four ladies who have taken up the mantle as the chief specter inspectors in the city of New York as they investigate a growing number of unusually high powered spooks running amok in the big apple.\n\nSigh...I could have written and cast a better film with the 4 hours and 57 minutes I have left in this day that would be better than the HORSECRAP I saw on the screen this afternoon. Part of what made the original Ghostbusters great was that it was a comedy but it looked like a serious drama or supernatural thriller. Its shot with wide angle lenses, it had a meticulously written script by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, two of the best writers for SNL and SCTV at the time and it always knew just how far to go with it's improv.\n\nThe problem with this version of Ghostbusters is that nobody wrote it. What I mean by that is that nobody WRITES comedies in general anymore. It's very clear that they just had a general rough draft grade idea of what they wanted to do with this movie and then they just get a bunch of improv actors together to shoot ten versions of one scene and pick the best one. Director Paul Feig has made a career out of doing just this. That style of making everything up as you go along is ok for something like The Heat or Bridesmaids, something that nobody has any expectations for. If Feig had decided to make another of his original comedies, I wouldn't have had a problem with him saddling up Melissa McCarthy and riding her to the finish line, but for the love of Pete Venkman, you CANNOT DO THAT with a movie like Ghostbusters. You can't fuel the remake of the number one movie of 1984, the number one year of movies ever, on pure \"yes, and...\" power. There were scenes that went nowhere, there was no cohesive theme, the editing was shoddy, the characters lacked any kind of depth or arch, and it was shot like an ABC family/Scooby-Doo film. I've seen Ghostbusters fan films that were more inspired than this movie and I can say that without any reservation. Don't even get me started on the Dumb and Dumber To grade disaster that Chris Hemsworth's character was. In short, nobody could be that stupid and function even in suspended reality. It's not all bad though, Kate McKinnon's character was very quirky and charming and there were some pretty good cameos and Easter eggs here but even they ended up leaving a sour taste in my mouth. It's kinda like dropping pieces of candy into a bowl of vomit, the more you see it, the more you are just disappointed that all the good stuff is getting ruined by everything around it. This is completely unacceptable for a 140 million dollar Sony movie.\n\nBefore I close, I have to address one more thing that really chaps my back and thighs which is the fact that the people responsible for making this movie accused misogynists and internet trolls of being against this movie because it starred four women. They did this while at the same time, they knew for a fact that they started their movie with crude toilet humor and ended it with a massive testicle punch joke. HOW DARE YOU! HOW! DARE! YOU!!!! Ghostbusters gets a 1... out of 5",

The awkward tension of Erin, the sassiness of Patty, the spontaneity and hilarity of Holtzmann, and the boldness of Abby makes the team the full package. The movie starts out with a fake haunt tour and then quickly turns into a real haunting. The movie had my rapt attention as I was sitting in my seat, waiting for the next scene. It's sweet, hilarious, and motivating. The cameos of the original Ghostbusters was a wonderful delight. \n\nThe characters could have their own movies and would be fascinating, especially Jillian. The way that they all get along and establish a beautiful sense of camaraderie that simply can't be beat, other than the OG's. The awkward way they all come together is a nice change of pace.\n\nWould recommend to people who are socially awkward, a Ghostbuster fan, a comedy fan, or someone who just wants an awkwardly funny movie to make you feel good. It's a good time with fun lines!",

A talented cast falls flat on its face thanks to a director who apparently told them all to behave like goofy hyperactive weirdos.  Cringe-inducing scenes of awkward improv go on for way too long.  The gross-out gags and potty humor would be immature in preschool.  The supernatural elements are idiotic and banal.  This movie felt like an excruciating two hours of watching a standup act flop.  There wasn't a single genuine laugh to be found in this whole dumb, loud, annoying disaster.",

The action scenes are decent, but nothing particularly spectacular. The humor is pretty split down the middle. Some of it works, and other times it misses and goes on for way too long. The actresses are all clearly talented, but they're let down by the lackluster direction and an overreliance on awkward add-libbing. But it's certainly a competent movie and isn't that bad of a watch. It certainly isn't the \"feminazi agenda endgame\" like so many online misogynists claimed it was back in 2016. But I still wouldn't exactly call it a comedic masterpiece or even a feminist masterpiece either. Forgettable, but forgivable.",
