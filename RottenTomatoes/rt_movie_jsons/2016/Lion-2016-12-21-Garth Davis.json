The second half beautifully explores how a seemingly simple matter\u2014that of being adopted in a foreign country\u2014can turn out to be so very emotionally complex. Apart from the fact that the movie is based on actual incidents, the best part for me was the way it slowly and steadily builds up to an emotional climax par excellence\u2014sans mushy melodrama.",

The film stars are Nicole Kidman and Dev Pastel, the main character are Rooney Mara, David Wenham, Sunny Pawar, Dev Pastel and Nicole Kidman. The film was based on a true story that of Saroo Bierley. This movie tells about a little boy of 5 years Saroo that lived with his mother and his brother. He finds himself alone on a train crossing India that takes him thousands of miles from his family. Lost Saroo learn to survive alone in the huge city of Calcutta. After some mesaventure he is taken by an Australian family who adopts him but a few years later, the young man decides to look for his biological family on Google maps and finds them but then learns that his brother is dead. I think that the plot seems to be absording from the start. The special effects was weak see even absent but the photography was just incredible and impressible. I found the performances of the characters very spectacular, natural and powerful in particular that of Nicole, Dev, David and Rooney. The script was so moving and at the same time beautiful, the music stuck perfectly with the actions of the characters as for the realization it was perfect there was a bit of everything, big plan, over the shoulder, extreme long shot etc. Generally I find this film absolutely fascinating. I recommend it to anyone who likes moving and dramatic movies and if you haven't seen it hurry up to see it because it's simply amazing.",

            "content": "A riveting drama about survival, home, and acceptance.\n\nGarth Davis' indie drama Lion (2016) is a harrowing Australian biopic about Saroo Brierley's tragic and inspiring life story.\n\nDavis' direction is intimate and honest bringing Saroo's incredible true story to life with gentle indie sensibilities. Lion depicts an Indian child, who got lost from his mother and home, adopted by an Australian family, and found his way home after 25 years. It's unreal to think about such long suffering and conflicted feelings, but Lion handles these complex emotions with sensitive filmmaking and earnest empathy as you watch the boy wander far from home into a hurt grown man with questions that need answering. Garth Davis takes on missing children, Indian poverty, and child trafficking with a gracious respect. Davis should really continue to direct dramas as his style fits all the sincere conversations between characters remarkably well. Lion is a phenomenal picture full of longing and love.\n\nFirst off, I must mention Sunny Pawar's magnificent child acting as young Saroo. His confused and scared looks are deeply affecting. His acting is very realistic too for such a young man. Dev Patel has never acted so complex or affecting in a role before. He is phenomenal as the Saroo Brierley as a young adult. He honestly should have been nominated for Best Lead Actor at The Oscars, I don't know how anyone could consider him a supporting role as he is Lion. His mane of hair, courageous spirit, gripping delivery, haunting facial expressions, devastating statements of confrontation, and tender interactions with his loved ones is just wonderful. Patel is actually underrated as an actor to me.\n\nI loved Rooney Mara in Lion as he embodies as loyal girlfriend Lucy and sympathetic ear for the long suffering Saroo. Mara has excellent and believable chemistry with Dev Patel. She acts with such nuance with every graceful look and gesture that she continues to impress me with every role. Likewise, Nicole Kidman is heartbreaking as Saroo's adopted mother Sue Brierley with her kind presence and welcoming affection. David Wenham is very likable and patient as Saroo's adopted father John Brierley. I love the scene where he pleads to Dev Patel behind his front door. It sounds so authentic.\n\nAbhishek Bharate is fantastic as Saroo's playful and attentive older brother Guddu. Divian Ladwa is strange, haunting, and unforgettable as Saroo's troubled adopted brother Mantosh Brierley. Tannishtha Chatterjee is fascinating as the deceptive Noor, who lures Saroo to the creepy Nawazuddin Siddiqui killing it as Rama.\n\nLuke Davies' script depicts a genuine relationship between mothers and their sons, brothers and their siblings, and boyfriends with their girlfriends. His writing is very naturalistic and carefully sympathetic to the real pain felt by this family. I appreciate his realistic words all the more upon a second viewing of Lion.\n\nAlexandre de Franceschi's editing is so smooth and creative. He cuts between a child's sudden odyssey and a man's turbulent present with effortless class and care. Lion feels more artistic in nature because of his thoughtful cutting choices. Greig Fraser's cinematography is shocking in how he beautifully portrays India and Australia's natural scenery as well as how he honestly displays India's abject poverty. Every mid-shot of each character's body is so striking.\n\nDustin O'Halloran and Volker Bertelmann's score for Lion is subtle with gentle melodies underneath heavy drama and sweeping majesty to accompany powerful reflective journeys. The sounds of Indian and Australian styles blend well in Lion with 1980's synths and traditional Indian instruments harmonizing to aid Lion's soft soundscape.\n\nIn all, Lion is 118 minutes of real tears and astonishing situations.",

            "content": "Having such a thin premise stretched out over nearly two hours of running time really hurts this film as while it has it's moments they are fleeting and the film is largely uninvolving. I was rather shocked by the fact that this film picked up so many awards nomination and although I note that it was produced by Harvey Weinstein and that was probably the reason that it made it's way into the \"hearts and minds\" of Academy Awards voters it did seem incredibly dull and milquetoast amidst a lineup that included Moonlight (2016) and Manchester by the Sea (2016). Hopefully we can move beyond films like this that present a story sure to wring emotional responses out of audiences but doesn't do so skillfully enough to overcome the fact that the film itself is bland schmaltz.\n\nAs a child Saroo, Dev Patel, boards a train from a station in Khandwa, India and accidentally separates himself from his mother and siblings. He arrives in Calcutta and struggles to support himself, falling into the hands of several suspicious figures, eventually he is picked up by child services and trained in preparation for adoption by an Australian family. He is raised by the kindly Sue Brierley, Nicole Kidman, and her husband John, David Wenham, who he grows comfortable with but the arrival of mentally unstable fellow adoptee Mantosh, Divian Ladwa, their family is thrown into disarray. As an adult Brierley is professionally successful and enters into a relationship with American Lucy, Rooney Mara, yet he wonders about who his true parents are and with the help of Google Maps seeks to track down his childhood home and family. This search puts him at odds with his adoptive mother who worries that he does not value her parentage and his girlfriend who feels that his focus on this issue is damaging their relationship.\n\nThe best section of the film comes when Brierley is adopted and we see the difficulties of integrating a foreign child into a new culture and family dynamic. Kidman is excellent as the caring mother struggling to keep her family together and she maintains that tremulous tone that she puts to such good use as the brittle, manipulative wife in Eyes Wide Shut (1999). The scenes of the family simply playing cricket on the beach or helping their son learn words in English are simply delightful and simply executed in a way that better highlights the emotional turmoil of Brierley than the other sections of the film. With the arrival of a troubled adoptive brother my interest in the family dynamic increased as this loose cannon with a tortured past could easily disrupt a seemingly settled unit. Sadly we cut from scenes of this devastation to an adult Brierley and other than scenes of him stabbing himself with the end of a fork we miss out on having this conflict developed.\n\nWhat we focus on instead is a boring young man who goes through a crisis that should be emotionally wrenching but seems as though he is mildly concerned therefore the audience is never really engaged. Patel is a fine actor but he fails to compel when we need to care about him and director Garth Davis fails to inject any urgency to the sight of a young man scrolling through Google Maps. Mara gets a thankless role as the needy girlfriend whom he inevitably breaks up with as because we know the course that the story takes we know they will break up and have no reason to invest in their relationship during early interactions. This is a movie where you know almost exactly how it begins and ends but where the real excitement of the film should come is in seeing how he gets from A to B and sadly this is the least fascinating part of the film.\n\nThe Academy would have done better to nominate Silence (2016) or Paterson (2016) for Best Picture as this is a film that likely will not be remembered in twenty to thirty years. Like Finding Neverland (2004) and Seabiscuit (2003) before it this film was inoffensive and reached a base standard of \u2018decency' that allowed it to receive awards for not dividing opinions greatly.",

Saroo is played to perfection in the first act by newcomer Sunny Pawar who perfectly illustrates the struggles someone his age might be dealing with when thrust into such abrupt change. The struggles of this young man are handled perfectly by director Garth Davis, making certain not to rely too much on increasingly awful situation after awful situation to allow the audience to sympathize with Saroo, instead relying on the performance of Pawar to accurately depict this child's many struggles. The gorgeous cinematography displayed throughout the film that lights up the slums of India and the suburbs of Tanzania alike is made first apparent from the third scene of the film, when Saroo is asleep at the train station, waiting for his brother, onward, becoming one of the shining points throughout the film. \n\n\tThe second act, despite brilliant performances from Nicole Kidman and Dev Patel, marks the film's weakest point. After the wonderful set-up in the first act of Saroo's sadness for his true family, the film almost takes a detour, instead favoring adding in development's into Saroo's interest as well as telling a romantic subplot that, while not completely unwarranted, greatly slows down the pace of the film. Almost all of the development into Saroo's collegiate endeavors, is instantly tossed aside as soon as Saroo starts to find himself, rendering that section of the film completely meaningless. \n\n\tThe third act of the film, while not as great as the first, greatly improves on the mistakes of the second and returns to the Saroo-centrical nature of the first act. The third act not only gives the necessarily happy conclusion to Saroo's arc of finding his \"home,\" it does this while masterfully finishing the subplot between Saroo and his Australian mother. The flaws of the third act mainly rely on its follow up of the second act which creates divides in terms of pacing and general plot development. While Saroo's discovery of his home may seem abrupt due to the unnecessarily slow nature of the second act, it is mostly in line with the pacing of the first act of the film. Lion, despite its flawed second act, is an extremely well-done and satisfying film that is buoyed by fantastic performances from the leads as well as an incredibly uplifting ending that leaves the audience, just like Saroo, in tears of joy.",

            "content": "Lion: The Personal Decision to Love\n\nDrama movies have always been a very popular option on the billboard. There are hundreds to watch and cry with, but what makes Lion (2016) stand out from all those other films? Together with the cast participating in this film, cinematography, production design and sound, Lion brings to the table a delicate story about the ties built inside a family when each one decides to love the others. There are many movies that want to convince us that love is about destiny, but Lion exhibits with clearity that the ones that love the most are the ones that choose and are committed to love.\n\n\n\nIndia is a beautiful country, rich in culture and traditions but economically poor for many. Inside this world, Kamla and her children try to survive by working hard jobs and begging for money in train stations. One night, two of her sons (Guddu and Saroo) went to a different town to find something to eat and bring home. While waiting for his older brother, Saroo fell asleep in one of the empty carriages at the station. When he woke up he realized that the train was moving and that he was miles away from home, getting lost in one of the most busy Indian cities. This little boy was lost for days and after being discovered by a government organization, he was flown out of his country and adopted by an Australian couple. More than twenty years later, Saroo became obsessed with his vague memories about his roots and starts a path to find home.\n\n\n\nIf you are a mom or if you are planning on becoming one, please bring tissues with you. The day you decided to be a mom, you decided to love your child. You probably knew that raising a child wouldn't \u00a0always be easy but you wanted to do it. You chose to have, raise, take care of, support and guide your child because you loved him/her since the first day you knew that his/her little heart was beating inside of you. Because of this pure maternal attachment, if our 5 year-old child gets lost and you don't know where he is, what would you be willing to do to find him? Maybe some of us would run all over the world looking for our children. But if we were single mothers, with other younger children to take care of and in a very poor economic situation, the options decrease. Priyanka Bose (Kamla) does an extraordinary job representing the true emotions of a mom that chooses to purily love her children. Her acting makes you feel like you're inside the film and it converts into a real scenario when watching!\n\n\n\nThis film also shows in a clear way the process of adoption and the true feelings of adoptive parents. Nicole Kidman and David Wenham (Sue & John Brierley) represent in a beautiful form how much love a couple can share with their non-biological kids. After talking with Saroo about the challenges that they have faced because of the adoption process, Kidman goes deep with the phrase: \"I could have had kids. We chose not to have kids. We chose you\". What a strong phrase to show and remind the public the reality of adoptive parents. When they adopted them, they chose to adopt their past stories too, making the experience of raising them more complicated. But their strength and desire to make their family happy helped them stay together, even when going through personal and home problems, specially accepting Saroo's dream to see his biological family again.\n\n\n\nDev Patel and Sunny Pawar (grown and young Saroo) also did an extraordinary job personalizing the main character. Across the entire film, the good characterization of the actors help the viewers create a relationship with them that crosses the screen. After months of being lost in Kolkata, Saroo does all that a 5-year-old could do to find home. He tries to buy a ticket back to his town and to communicate with others, but they don't speak his language. Even though he was young, he chooses not to give up and find his mom and siblings. Pawar's innocence and fear make us enter his world and see the reality from his eyes. It wouldn't be surprising if you end up talking to the screen as if Saroo could hear you. In the same way, Patel makes us sprout emotions of desperation and complete happiness while he deeply searches in his memories for the roots of his hometown and family. He could have decided not to find his family in India and live the life that he already was living in Australia (good economic situation, loving adoptive parents, girlfriend, attending college), but he chose to look for them because he loved them. Dev Patel makes a wonderful representation of what someone is willing to do when when they are completely engaged to love.\n\n\nLion is a movie for the entire family. It's a film for kids, teenagers and adults that reflects the importance of family, perseverance and hard-work. Lion goes beyond the expectations; it is not just a \"drama movie\". Together with the great representation of Indian culture, this film makes you think about your life and the decisions you have taken to show appreciation to your loved ones. It is a great story that provokes an emotional understanding within the viewers about our home: family is not made by fate, it is made by you.",

Anyone who has experienced even a brief memory of being lost as a small child will sit on the edge of their seat as the story of Saroo is told. \"Lion\" is thought-provoking, to say the least, as it will stay with you for much longer than its 129 minute length. Unfortunately, the story weakens when Dev Patel, an adult Saroo, reaches a point in his life where he is on his own, building his future and stumbles upon a memory from his past. While the viewer isn't surprised at Saroo's desire to go back to India to find out what happened to his family, the story implication that this thought was seemingly nonexistent from the day he was adopted to this memory-stirring moment, is confusing and unbelievable. The film resolves itself in an equally powerful way as the first 45 minutes of the film, but while it's a great film, the second act takes it out of Best Picture contention for me. Still, for the statistical horror it portrays, \"Lion\" is a must see.",

Perhaps the film was over-hyped leading me to have high expectations. Or perhaps it suffered from a contrast effect since I'd watched an intellectually stimulating film the night before.  Or perhaps it just felt like it was trying too hard (with sweeping musical cues to tell me when to feel moved).  Whatever the reason, I wasn't grabbed the way others have been.  That isn't because scenes of poverty and kids in distress in India don't affect me - Pather Panchali (1955) is one of my favourites.  Here, Sunny Pawar is adorable as the boy (who grows up to be Dev Patel) who is accidentally lost thousands of kilometres from home and then adopted from an orphanage in Calcutta by a Tasmanian couple (played by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham).  But Patel himself seems somewhat constricted, probably because the script has him ruminating about finding his real mum (a rural labourer) for a good chunk of the running time, pushing aside girlfriend Rooney Mara in the process.  Finally though, Google Earth is there to save him (and indeed Google pitched in to sponsor the film) and we get the ending we'd been advertised.  I'm sure this was incredibly dramatic when it happened to the real Saroo Brierley, but I found the narrative to be rather simplistic (even with the brother Mantosh subplot that doesn't really go anywhere).  True, there are some beautiful Australian and Indian vistas to behold and if you aren't curmudgeonly like me, you might feel exalted by these vistas, the music, and the stirring emotional story.",

I began to be afraid the movie would end before that, but it was instead the perfect buildup and resolution that leaves the viewer heartbroken,  relieved, happy, sad, and satisfied. The actor for adult Saroo is a head and a half taller and a good deal lighter than all the other people in the community in which he was raised, but otherwise great actor character match up. Funny that he went into Hotel management. Why did the boy in the (Orphanage??) and his adopted brother Mantosh go into fits of hurting/hitting themselves? It never does go into their story, though it doesn't need to, it leaves me personally, curious. As well as the children in the train station that got rounded up. Or what exactly the woman who was \"helping\" Saroo and the man with her that said \"he was exactly what they were looking for\" really wanted for him, I love the title. I was waiting to see how it tied into this lost boy's story, and it was a smile at the end to understand. Overall this is a beautiful although tear jerking story of love and humanity, and the lack at times.  The flashbacks and Saroo seeing Guddu throughout his life still looking for him ever reminding him of where and what he lost were a great tie into his past and well timed. Beautiful movie.

The first half of it is queerly insightful as it depicts the world through the eyes of young Saroo. In this kind of movies with a very strong biopic component, I'm always afraid the filmmaker will just scrape the childhood part and jump right to the money-making star power but newcomer Garth Davis takes his sweet time in it, keeping for a whole hour his shots close to the child, gracefully detailing his wonder and his watchful, hypersensitive view of the world. And, the actor who plays young Saroo, Sunny Pawar, gives a standout performance (best one in the movie), carrying the whole half.  Rooney Mara is unsurprisingly flawless and the score is splendorous which should translate to an Oscar nom. Despite all this, when we pass the half-way mark, the movie becomes standard, as it resorts to Americanized filmmaking devices which is absent from the previous almost \"European indie\" kind of vibe. The performances are all very solid though I don't feel that neither Dev nor Nicole should have been nominated for a Golden Globe (and I adore Nicole!), and, though it's based on real life, the way the hero resolves his conflict feels too convenient and the reveal is conventional. Ultimately, we spend too little time with grown Saroo, so in the end we don't feel the emotional journey as much as we should. Also, a fade to black should be regarded as something special, only to be used when it's strictly necessary.This film uses and abuses them, and they become annoying. A fade to black, unless necesis lazy editing and directing so they are to be avoided. Still, the movie has something deep to say about unconventional families and coming back to our rooots!",

The heartbreak and struggle that you see in him while trying to find his family is really well-done, and really captures what it would've actually been like for the real Saroo. The scenery is also really good in this movie, it really gets you immersed into the world that Saroo lived in, and the harsh atmosphere of living on the streets in a busy and populated place like India. This movie has a bit of everything: heart, drama, desperation, romance, comedy, you name it, and I enjoyed every bit of it. I would've liked to have seen a bit more of young saroo, and his struggle to live on the streets, although that was shown quite a bit in the movie.

            "content": "Lion, is based on the real story of Saroo who, as a little boy in rural India, got lost on a train and hurtled thousands of miles away to Calcutta. After being adopted by an Australian couple, years later as an adult, Saroo goes on a frantic search to find his home and be re-united with his family. First of all, Sunny Pawar, who plays young Saroo, is absolutely excellent in this film and carries a good 2/3 almost on his own, homeless on the streets, desperately trying to get by and get back to his family. Then Dev Patell puts in a great performance as the adult Saroo who becomes fixated on finding his family, searching the railway lines without even knowing the name of his village. It is an extremely emotional story, seeing how callous most of the adults are towards the homeless children, the pain of separation for Saroo and the love and acceptance of his adoptive parents. The film does start to lose steam in the last third of the film however with Saroo as an adult, with an somewhat uninteresting love story and the addition of his seemingly unstable adoptive brother. Overall though it is a very touching film, that focusses on the emotional trauma of a lost child and even goes so far as highlighting that over 80,000 children go missing in India every year and collaborating with organisations to support these children.",

In the 2nd Act the narrative begins to sag. 7 or 8 minutes of cutting would've fixed that & still yielded sufficient run time. But the 3rd Act and ending documentary scenes recover the story. A bit jarring though is how the young Saroo morphs into a visage that seems not to be India'n, nearly caucasian, or maybe half India'n at most. This is most obvious in the final scenes. Patel is an India'n surname and he's a fine actor in this production. Still ... This casting perhaps unintentionally imparts a slight racist undertone.\n\nDefinitely a thumbs-up. And a story about lost & misplaced kids that needs wide distribution. Thank-you Weinsteins for bankrolling blue-road (Kuralt) productions and giving us more \"Chocolats.\"",

Dev Patel shines in this role, you can see how he becomes more and more haunted by his memories as the movie progresses and his obsession with finding his biological family deepens.  It is profoundly emotionally affecting, but has none of the contrived sugary sweetness that often goes hand-in-hand with that.  The emotion of the film is natural and builds as it progresses, and before I knew it, I was surprised to find myself completely and totally invested in this family.  \"Lion\" is the biggest surprise for me this year, as I did not expect to love it as much as I did.  Though it is certainly deserving of a nomination, this film falls into the \"it was an honor to have been nominated\" category.",

Not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told.\n\nVery impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career. For the first time I liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. The second best performance in his career. Though his part comes only after the half way mark. Yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments.\n\nI was wondering why it was called 'Lion'. And I got answered only just before the end credit. So you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. It was not until the 90s the India began to see a real change. This story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. That kid was so good. Just like Jacom Tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'Room'.\n\nIt was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. The film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. Less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. The music was good. Only negative was the film was out of depth. Yeah, all the events were like fast forward. If they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. Especially I wanted the Australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids.\n\nNow I'm waiting for the 2020. I mean 2008 was SDM, 2012 was LoP and 2016 was this one. The 4 years later, surely there will be another India related western film would come. Despite this film nominated for the 6 Oscars, it had won nothing. That's very sad. Overall, I strongly suggest it. One of the best films of the Year.\n\n9/10",

So many people jammed into what looks like a not very sanitary environment. The train station is nuts, and the way these poor Indian people live is just sad. \nDav Patel is very good as the grown up child who was lost. Everyone else is just kind of there doing their parts, but we never really connect with them much. \nI do wonder why it took him 24 years to suddenly decide to try and find his family. Did he try before this? They don't indicate that he did. \nThen I wonder why it took another 2+ years of research when the obvious answer was what did it it in the end. Why didn't he start there? I don't know. \nIt can be an emotional story, but not the way the director and writers obviously wanted us to feel.\nI just never connected with the characters to feel enough. \nWhats crazy is that this IS a true story.

Although it isn't easy to bring to life a true story of an inspiring individual, the film succeeds. It is due in large part to the powerful performances. Sunny Parwar and Dev Patel, the actors who play the young and older version of Saroo are terrific. Parwar is marvelous, and carries the first half of the film through his emotional expressions. Patel, on the other hand, commands the second half of the film as the older Saroo. Despite an engrossing first-half, \"Lion\" is slightly overlong and drags towards the end.

Kidman shows a depth to her acting that has rarely been glimpsed before providing an powerfully moving support role which adds layers of complexity and intrigue to a myopic plot. All in all Lion, may bank too much on a deep and heavy plot and sometimes this gravity feels emotionally overwhelming but audiences will leave the viewing having realised and challenges themselves on what it means to be loved and what it means to have family.

            "content": "Northern India, 1986.  Guddu and his younger brother Saroo help out their impoverished family by scavenging anything they can.  One night Guddu and Saroo are separated at a train station.  Saroo tries to find Guddu but ends up on a train that takes him to Calcutta, 1,600 kms away.  In Calcutta he is taken in by a organisation that finds adoptive parents for orphans and lost kids.  Saroo is adopted by an Australian couple, the Brierleys, and moves to Hobart, Tasmania.  20 years later he decides to find his mother and brother. \n\nQuite flat for something that should have been enthralling and emotional.  \n\nStarts very well - the story of how Saroo was separated from his brother and ends up in Australia is well told and is very engaging.\n\nThe movie, however, loses its way in the second act - where the 20-something Saroo first goes to Melbourne and then starts to look for his mother.  The plot development here is incredibly padded, filled with empty, superficial melodrama and sub-plots that go nowhere, making for dull viewing.  The search itself was interesting, but does not get much screen time and is diluted by the padding around it.  \n\nThere's also the fact that you know from the trailers and synopsis where this is all going.  Trying to create an air of mystery around the course the plot is going to take is pointless when viewers already know the outcome.\n\nIt all comes together, eventually.  Ending is quite emotional.\n\nUltimately, okay, but could have been really good with a tighter, shorter middle-to-late section.",

I haven't been that much a fan of Dev Patel's work in the past, but the actor has come into his own with a stunning portrayal of Saroo, a man who is trying to reconcile his new life with the past that was taken from him; he impressively brings the audience along on his journey with intimate, gut-wrenching acting. Second only to \"Hunt for the Wilderbeasts,\" it is one of the most underrated movies of last year, and definitely one of its best movies.",

On the face of it, I understand that, it's the sort of film that Mum's will probably love, based on a true story spanning continents and focusing on the love between Mother's and Sons, families torn apart and the search for your true self.  Well corny or not I absolutely loved it, the opening half set in India (subtitled with astonishing performances) is some of the best film work I've seen in years.  I was touched and ultimately moved, in the second half it's fairly obvious where the story is heading and so dramatic tension is lost but Dev Patel lends a perfect touch to his performance.  Believable and empathetic, an excellent film.",

The only good acting was from little Sunny Pawar who really makes you feel bad about Saroo. I guess we sympathize more when it comes to children.\n\nThe real credit, and I mean it, goes to Director Garth Davis whose, I read, 'Lion' was directorial debut. If an Indian Director would've directed this, I wouldn't have been so impressed. It would have been normal for them. But when a foreign director comes to a foreign country and still manages to capture it so beautifully is highly commendable.\n\nDespite all that, it bored me for roughly 20 minutes. It starts slow, and spends a lot of time with Saroo's younger self. You run out of sympathy for the kid for that long. That's probably the first half.\n\nThe second half is him grown up and his education. There is a wonderful scene before he decides to find his home that I will not spoil. But the stuff with Google Earth gets repetitive and boring with the audience not understanding much. Though those scenes were vital to the film and had to be included.\n\nI wasn't emotionally moved as much as I thought I would.\n\nAlso another issue that I wanna address is that films like these should be family friendly. Not 'R' or 'PG-13'. 'Lion' clearly is not a family film. Kids also need to see it to inspire them.\n\nI still think 'Lion' is a good film and worth your time.\n\nBut a one-time watch for me at least. Recommended!",

            "content": "A little Indian boy (Sunny Pawar) gets separated from his family and ends up far away from home, living on the streets and in orphanage, until he's adopted by a nice couple who take him to Australia. \n\nAlso starring: Dev Patel as boy as an adult, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham as his new parents, Rooney Mara, Diwian Ladwa. \n\nBased on a true story which was turned into book, written by the boy himself, and now a movie.\n\nI liked \"Lion\" a lot, for the most part it's gripping and packs a strong emotional punch. But the two-hour story as a whole is uneven, losing steam during its last quarter and - even worse - starting manipulating with the audience in unconvincing way.\n\nThis big shift doesn't kill the movie but the whole experience would win if adult Saroo's journey was compressed into shorter period of time. As it is, the last quarter is not quite compatible with the previous hour and a half and ends up killing the mood that has been masterfully built up and maintained almost from the start. \n\nThe adult cast offers impressive performances during that last quarter which is totally worth the awards recognition it has garnered. I am especially glad to see Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara getting strong, well-written female characters and thus turning in more interesting work as usual for them.\n\nBut the movie makers could have easily shortened the adult Saroo's detective work part which really bogs the story down and seems to be more of an excuse to show Patel hanging around aimlessly. \n\nHe'd still have enough screen time for all those stronger acting scenes with the girlfriend and family, or just showing off his fab new looks. Watch out, girls and manlovers, he's turned into quite a heartbreaker indeed, wild hair and strong body, and all...\n\n\"The mood that has been masterfully built up and maintained almost from the start\", as mentioned above, is the main reason why \"Lion\" turns out to be such a moving journey. \n\nThe director uses as little dialogue and talking as possible, concentrating on just showing this lost little boy wandering around - sometimes enhancing the events with not too intrusive music. \n\nThe environment becomes a character of its own - alien, dirty, sometimes hostile. Watching this little guy just trying to get by, without trying to make him act\", or remind us to feel something, gives the story a lot of poetic power and unexpected dimension of depth. \n\nSadly they are unable to repeat or resuscitate this feeling later on, although Patel gives an strong performance of his own, as stated above.\n\nInterestingly, 2008's \"Slumdog Millionaire\" - Dev Patel's breakthrough hit which also shows the shadow side of India and its childrens' lives - is also a movie of two halves, the first of which excites a lot and the second kind of kills the buzz. \n\nSo, it's a great movie for the first three quarters and just okay after that.\n\n\"Lion\" is one of the frontrunners during this award season, with 60 nominations and 32 wins already under the belt. It's nominated for 6 Oscars: movie, adapted screenplay, supporting actor (Patel) and actress (Kidman), cinematography and music. Was also nominated for four Golden Globes but did not win any.",

The film is broken up into two acts, the first is about Saroo as a boy getting lost and trying to find his way in India and the second act follows Saroo twenty years later desperately looking for his old home. Lion is led by very powerful performances from Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman but is easily stolen from the kid, Sunny Pawar. In his movie debut, Sunny is astonishing and pulls off a performance I most certainly couldn't have when I was his age. The camera work is top notch and the soundtrack is spot on, really adding to the emotion of some of the scenes. Some people found the second half to be melodramatic, slow, and the scenes with Patel using Google Earth \"uncinematic\". I found this to be the opposite as not once was I feeling bored or just waiting for the movie to end. Instead I followed the film closely to the bitter end and enjoyed the journey. I think my biggest problem with the movie is the fact that Rooney Mara is just there and doesn't really do anything. Otherwise I think Lion was fantastic and is a very good movie.",

The narrative builds to a conclusion that had me weeping at the end in an uncontrollable catharsis.

There are inner-conflicts and issues with his adoptive family to be dealt with but he eventually starts to put the pieces together to fill in the gaps left by his childhood separation. The conclusion is a very powerful example of a story reaching a climax and tying up all the strands of the narrative almost perfectly. This is a great movie about what it means to be alive.",

Dev Patel carries an incredibly vibrant performance of the true story of Saroo Brierley, who was lost as a child and then attempts to find his family in his 20's. Pair that with grand sweeping landscapes and the incredibly endearing Sunny Pawar, who shines despite the grit of 1980's slums of India, and it had everything I could have wanted in a hauntingly true film. This movie stuck with me days after leaving the theater and only deepened the lifelong crush I have been harboring on Dev Patel (which started in Slumdog and escalated in The Newsroom). I am in general pretty lukewarm on Nicole Kidman, but this is her at her best, and her maternal interactions seemed authentic without being romanticized. All in all, this was near perfect to me, and somehow managed to avoid landmine cliches that could have cheapened this standout of 2016. 9.7/10",

So you enter the theatre with a general idea of what's going to happen, which can lead to a painfully trite viewing experience if the creative team takes a paint-by-numbers approach to telling the story. And in this case, with a neophyte director behind the lens too, what could be expected from Lion? Well let me tell you, strap on your emotional seatbelt, this Lion has a roar all its own. Shot with passion, grandeur and beauty to spare, Lion captivates from its first frame to the last. Overcoming every genre faux pas as it sweeps you up in a whirlwind of humanity, affirming what lies deepest in us all. The desire to be loved, to be remembered.......and to never let go. Nicole Kidman returns to top form. Kudos to Dev Patel and Rooney Mara for continuing their scene stealing ways, and to Sunny Pawar for the most heartening of debuts.",

Then it goes 20 years into the future, which is something they had to do, but it wasn't nearly as interesting to me after that part. I think it's because the characters seemed to me to be in the exact same spot in their lives from when we saw them 20 years earlier. Of course, after the jump we see them grow and advance, but it does take a little bit for that to happen. I also thought the ending was a bit rushed. Nevertheless, I didn't hate the second half, I just thought it could've started better is all. I really enjoyed the real life footage at the end, and there were very good character moments throughout, but Saroos father in Australia seemed to take a major backseat in the entire film and I'm not sure why. Lion is a solid film, but I'm not sure it was worthy of a best picture nomination",

He is raised in their household and after becoming a young adult he endeavors to retrace his way back home to his village and his original family.  Lion is a pretty straightforward and unpretentious treatise on family, identity, and belonging.  The protagonist (played excellently by both child actor Sunny Pawar and veteran Dev Patel) is a child of two worlds and finds that even as a fully-grown and educated man, he is still a scared, lonely boy on the run.  There are excellent supporting performances from the likes of Nicole Kidman, David Wenham, and Rooney Mara, and the film makes notable use of language and silent isolation to tell its story.  Lion meanders on a bit in the middle, much like its dejected main character, but it's bookended by truly strong and emotionally gripping first and third acts.  I personally found it superior to the once celebrated Slumdog Millionaire (the OTHER movie about Indian poverty starring Dev Patel) as it trades in that film's fantastic whimsy for a realistic and earnest tone.  This is movie that few people have seen so far and I would really recommend it as a rental or download.  The bittersweet and realistic ending is worth the effort.",

Over 80,000 children go missing in India each year.  You can learn more about the movement that has started because of this movie at www.lionmovie.com\nDetermination, love, courage, home, family, blood, bonds, heritage, adoption\n\nThings I liked:\nBeautiful cinematography.  Greig Fraser (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Zero Dark Thirty) uses a child's perspective to film surrounding areas and provide a sense of wonder.\nThree cheers for Google Earth!\nThe love of Sue (Nicole Kidman) and John (David Wenham) for their adopted children was so sweet.  I got teary eyed almost every time Sue was with her sons.\nYou don't learn the touching reason why the movie is called Lion until the very end of the movie.\nDev Patel plays the grown-up Saroo with the absolutely adorable Sunny Pawar playing the young Saroo.\nWhat makes the movie even more powerful is knowing that it's a true story.  You get to see real footage of when Sue meets Saroo's biological mother just three years ago in 2014.\nAs an instructor at Le Cordon Bleu Culinary College, I thought it was fascinating that it was food that suddenly brought memories back to Saroo about his childhood.\nI enjoyed learning more about India and its culture. We also get to visit Australia in the movie.\n\nThings I didn't like:\nSPOILER:  It made me so sad that no one would help Saroo in the train station.  Poor thing.  I just wanted to hug him tightly and give him something to eat.\nThe beginning and end were really great, but it starts to drag in the middle when Saroo grows up and gets depressed and mopey before taking action.\nSome of the editing was choppy.\nWhen you first see Nicole Kidman in that wig, you think, \"What the heck?\", but then, when you see the real Sue at the end of the movie, you think, \"Oh, Ok.\"\n\n \n\nInteresting lines:\n\"You weren't just adopting us, but our past as well.\" - Saroo\n'I really hope she's there.  She needs to see how beautiful you are.\" - Sue \nTips for parents: \nThere are subtitles in the first half of the movie and again in the end.\nPre-marital relations.\nYour children will see some extreme poverty and, hopefully, be grateful for what they have.",

The love interest, Lucy, is just kind of there and isn't fleshed out.

            "content": "In a year where I was told so many of the Best Picture nominees were difficult emotional journeys, Lion is the first one to really deliver on that for me. I cried at least 5 times while watching this movie. It hit so many emotional notes brilliantly. I was crying out of sadness with the characters, and out of joy. I could see someone saying that the story was designed in such a way to make it emotionally manipulative, but because it was based on a true story and was filled with honest performances it worked for me. \n\nThe first half of Lion is superb, and I absolutely loved little Sunny Pawar. He gave a tremendous performance, with nuance beyond his years. The whole film would fall apart if he didn't make us care about Saroo, but he nails it. He's completely adorable and I think I could watch him do his little run all day long. Abhishek Bharate was also excellent as the older brother, Guddu. The connection between these two boys lies at the heart of this whole film, even beyond the connection between Saroo and his mother.\n\nThe second half of Lion is good, but doesn't quite live up to the potential of what was set up. Dev Patel is great and he has some strong moments that connect us perfectly to the Saroo that we met at the beginning. The flaw for me in the second half is that there are several moments where the plot stagnates. It feels like the wheels are spinning and I'm just desperately waiting for the inevitable conclusion. In fact it almost seemed like Rooney Mara's character was voicing my own frustration. Luckily, sprinkled throughout this section of the film are some powerful scenes. Nicole Kidman gets a couple of them and I can see why she got a Supporting Actress nomination. \n\nThe end of this film, without delving into spoilers, was exactly what I was looking for and yet also not what I wanted. That's not to say it was done poorly, or that it was a disappointment, there was simply a bittersweet feeling to the end. I can't say much more than that. I didn't know what to expect, because I did not know anything about the true story before seeing the film, and I think that's a great way to go in because I genuinely didn't know how it would end. Lion might not be the best film of the year, but I thought it was well made and delivered a marvelous story.",

Dev Patel is stellar in the lead role, adopting an Australian accent, long hair and a penchant for temperamental mood shifts. The first half of the movie is definitely the most compelling, and kudos to Sunny Pawar for being a child actor who actually doesn't spoil the proceedings with any awkward line-readings or clueless deliveries. It's also the best directed half, capturing exactly what it must be like to be trapped in a foreign world, even one which is supposed to be your own, and having said world tower all around you. Unfortunately, the second half has a tendency to drag, with repeated scenes of Patel staring at a map and/or laptop screen. It's an emotional movie no doubt, and the frequent moping, pushing important people away, questioning everything you think you knew etc. is fairly trite. It's not that the second half is bad, it's just that it fails to measure up to the first. The tear-jerking climax will move some and nauseate most, but it's really the only way the film could properly end. Its strengths lie in its acting, direction and bringing to light a tale so fascinating it warrants at least one viewing. It may be oversentimental at times, but for a story like this, it's understandably hard to avoid.",

It did a fantastic job of luring me in and putting me on the edge of my seat wondering what to expect next!\nThe character development between Saroo (Played by Dev Patel and Sunny Pawar) and his brother Guddu (Played by Abhishek Bharate) However the film decided to cut a hole in its own boat as soon as it reached the second act where he meets his plot devic- oops I mean 'Love interest' Lucy played by Rooney Mara. As soon as Lucy was introduced (Sloppily) this so far great movie crashed and burned. The reason why is because Rooney played one of the most forced, bland, pointless, irritating characters I have ever seen in a movie (And believe me, calling this mess a character is beyond generous) Rooney's 'character' serves as nothing but a forced relationship and unnecessary plot device that ironically does the opposite. Lucy's introduction is extremely abrupt and limited, she seems unnaturally forced into the plot and Saroo's life. Soon enough its shown Lucy wont actually have a character or anything human or relatable about her but will be there to create conflict that in the end has no actual effect to the overall plot. For days I have been constantly wondering why Lucy was even in this film, she is nothing but 45 minutes of your life you will never get back (And only god knows why she takes up a third of space on the poster) she distracts the audience by changing Saroo's intentions and interests constantly making the audience care less and less about Saroo's goal as well as numbing every emotion the great first quarter of this film emitted. It feels like two people tugging at at a steering wheel trying to drive the plot in a different direction each. maybe this would matter a tiny bit less if she wasn't played off as such a main and essential character to the story but it was so bad I felt as if I was actually just waiting for her to leave.\n\nAfter the embarrassment that is act 2 is over act 3 begins...\nand then ends in what feels like 20 minutes. I cannot begin to describe the pacing in this film as I feel like you would need a brain the size of a watermelon to even comprehend this mess. After the drawn out, lengthy abomination that is act two the film decides that it wants to end as soon as possible (Probably out of embarrassment or humiliation) the ending leaves a lot of questions unanswered and its shortness makes all the emotions the film's ending disappear, as soon as the unfitting pop song plays as the credits roll. \n\nIn conclusion I think you should give this film a go. Its not great but its certainly not bad either. I may not have enjoyed it but if the large majority of others see something that I cant in this film its worth a shot. I also think the first act of this film is fantastic and wonderfully done.\n\nAll together I would give this a 2.5/5 rating\nIt had great potential but then it lost it around the second act",

            "content": "It's odd that Lion is a film based on a true story, yet its premise seems familiar: a young man searches for the family he was separated from as a young boy. Yet, the events in Lion are so improbable-but-true that you can't help but be surprised and awed at how the life its main character, Saroo Brierly, unfolded. Lion tugs at your heartstrings and stirs up emotions in all the ways you would expect and... it works. If you cry at movies, you'll likely feel the tears flow while watching Lion and that's okay.\n\nThere are two distinct parts to Lion. In the first half, we see little Saroo living with his mother and older brother in a poor rural village in India. His older brother, Guddu, takes random chores and odd jobs to help support their family. One night, a new job means traveling by train at night. Saroo is eager and excited to help, and Guddu reluctantly brings him along. Guddu leaves Saroo at a train station and tells him to wait while he sees about the job. Saroo falls asleep and wakes up in the middle of the night to find the train station deserted. He calls out for his brother and looks for him on an out of service train which springs into service and takes him thousands of miles away from his home. \n\nYoung Sunny Pawar, who plays Saroo as a child, is remarkably good on screen. His wide-eyed precociousness helps him survive on the streets of Calcutta where he doesn't speak the local language and can't pronounce the name of his hometown. He finds his way into an orphanage that seems too similar to a prison, but it is here that he is adopted by an Australian couple played by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham. \n\nA jump in time takes us to the second part of the film. As a young man, Saroo, now played by Dev Patel, feels more Australian than Indian. He is disconnected from his Indian heritage until a chance sense memory inspires him to track down his original home and mother and brother. It is at this point that Lion treads close to clich\u00e9 territory. Dev Patel has many scenes where he is moody, depressed, and conflicted about his quest. Does searching for his real mother mean he's ungrateful to his adoptive mother? The movie seems more concerned with the mechanics of how he finds out where his childhood village in India is (with much internet research and Google Earth), than with what is going on inside of the characters. Older Saroo's emotions, which should be driving the second half of Lion, feel more obligatory than earned. That's not to say that when the big scenes in this movie come they don't bring pathos. The final scenes of Lion are genuinely moving. \n\nI wouldn't say that Lion is an uneven film, but from a technical standpoint the best part of Lion is young Saroo's near dialogue free journey through the streets of Calcutta. He encounters uncaring adults, seemingly kind but actually sinister adults, and journeys by foot in a direction that he hopes will take him home. Director Garth Davis keeps the camera and the audience at a distance from young Saroo, giving this sequence the feel of a documentary. Every unlikely encounter young Saroo has seems unfortunately believable. It is a piece of incredible filmmaking that the rest of Lion doesn't equal.\n\nDev Patel has some good scenes of emotional dialogue with Kidman and Rooney Mara, playing his supportive girlfriend. Mara is good, as always, but doesn't have much else to do aside from be supportive. The actors handle these scenes well-Patel and Kidman have picked up Supporting Actor and Actress Oscar nominations, respectively. It is their interactions that keep the audience engaged. This is ultimately an uplifting and heartwarming story and the sentiment doesn't feel forced. You may feel like you've seen this kind of movie before, and I'm sure you have, but Lion is still worth watching.",

Lion's undeniably uplifting story and talented cast make it a moving journey that transcends the typical cliches of its genre. Once in awhile, a movie comes along that is so touching and sincere, without a moment of false emotion or manipulative self-indulgence, that it establishes squatters' rights and moves into your heart to stay. This amazing true story with remarkable performances by Dev Patel, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and newcomer Sunny Pawar has, like the title would suggest, a blend of brute force and elegance. Patel brilliantly portrays a young man adrift in a sea of uncertainty towards his identity, haunted by a past he barely survived and guilt ridden over loving a family he barely knew. Lion starts strong and finishes on a teary high, with its comparatively lesser moments buoyed by the presence of Patel. A sober and yet profoundly stirring contemplation of family, roots, identity and home, which engrosses throughout the course of its two-hour running time. Unsurprisingly, the finale is manipulative in every way, squeezing out the emotions of the audience. But Lion's well-plotted narrative and thoughtful characters suck you in so much that the journey there is totally worth it.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

On one hand it's a beautifully shot movie with interesting conflicts and is definitely emotionally impactful, but on the other hand it is like really, really ridiculously disjointed. It's basicly two different movies connected with a funnily loose middle act. First we have a reiteration of \"Slumdog millionaire\" with a field trip trough the \"best\" of India(because that gets you Oscars) then a series of time skips that turn the pacing upside down including underdeveloped characters like the protagonist step brother and girlfriend and then there is what appears to be in my mind one of the most beautiful explorations of adoption I've seen. The protagonists step parents are brilliant and are the high point of the film. Next we have the ending that was the expected tear jerker, but it was hurt by the lack of subsistence of the preceding acts due to the never ending time skips. Overall it has lots of faults and positives, but an Oscar? I don't think so.",

Dev Patel then picks up the baton and runs with it, continuing the emotional journey.  For some of you, a box of tissues will be required as it's quite emotional.\n\nOne for all to watch and be grateful for what they have.  A passionate, deep and genuinely moving movie.

It was one of the first movies where I almost contemplated walking out on -- not because it was *bad*, but because it was unenjoyable and hard to watch.\n\nOnce the movie turns to modern day, it gets easier, but not all the time.

It's a film of a definite two halves; the first half unflinchingly depicting the harsh brutalities of street life for Calcutta's lost children, the second half a more palatable but well-trodden journey of self-discovery. Patel's honest performance prevents this sentimentality becoming too mawkish, ably assisted by a grounded Kidman as his adopted mother (one of her finest performances for some years). For me however it's 5 year old Saroo's story that was the most engrossing, alarming and heart-breaking, played with perfection by Pawar. Lion may play safe in its storytelling, but it's affecting, distressing and ultimately uplifting. Only the hardest of hearts could fail to quiver a little by the closing credits.",

It is an amazing example of how the Internet has created endless possibilities for communication and research in a way that changes lives.  From the moment that I first saw the trailer, this became one of my most anticipated films of the year.  It actually did not meet my expectations, but my frustration with this year's weak Oscar class has led me to approach many of the films with high hope-filled expectations that this will be \"the one\" to redeem 2016.  The storytelling grew a bit muddled at the start of Saroo and Lucy's relationship, shifting focus away from the adoption and search for his family.  Still, the film hits all of the right emotional notes to bring this story to life.  The train sequence and crowded train station in West Bengal are a heart wrenching introduction to Saroo's turbulent journey.  The sad piano score by Dustin O'Halloran and Hauschka highlights each dramatic moment throughout the film, especially the ending scene which I consider to be the most beautiful moment in cinema for 2016.  The score was nominated for an Oscar, as were the performances by Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman.  Their acting drives the second half of the film through the strong emotions of sadness and pain, but the real standout is 8-year-old Sunny Pawar.  At first glance, it seems odd that Patel's nomination is for Supporting Actor but it makes sense as Pawar carries the entire first half of the film on his shoulders.  His chemistry with Abhishek Bharate (who plays his older brother Guddu) and ability to advance the story through his mannerisms (since a 5-year-old character in a country that doesn't speak his language leads to limited dialogue) is as good as many veteran actors.  I understand Rooney Mara's presence in the film because this is a true story, but Saroo's disconnect from his mother AND his girlfriend is redundant in shaping his character.  The Oscar-nominated cinematography does a brilliant job of capturing the landscape of India, the grim areas of Calcutta, and the beauty of Tasmania, but my favorite part of the entire film may be the title.  I spent a good deal of time wondering why the film is called \"Lion,\" and saving the explanation for the final moment of the film enhances its poignancy tenfold.  It was an amazing final thought at the end of the film.  \"Lion\" is not a flawless film but it is a film that families can enjoy together, its incredible true story must be seen to believed, and the final result is an amazing buildup to the most beautiful moment in cinema for 2016.",

Based off of the true story of a young boy who gets lost far away from home when boarding a train, this movie really respects the story and is very accurate to the true event. The movie is very emotional at times but unlike a dog's purpose, it doesn't just make you sad, the movie lets you feel a true emotion. Not just make you sad all the time. The acting was great in this movie a long with everything else in my opinion. It's so sad to see that a great movie like this doesn't get the full attention it deserves. This movie is like the small one that ends up being great. Over all this movie is just amazing. Worth buying on blu ray and seeing in theaters. Can't wait for blu ray release.",

After growing up with an Australian couple that adopted him, Saroo begins using the internet to find his home.\n\nAdapting a true story onto the big screen is always a difficult task because there will always be people chomping at the bit to attack any, erherm, alternative facts. I went into watching this without reading up on the true story because I didn't want to be one of those people. The first 40 minutes of this film are beautiful. Sunny Pawar is a fantastic child actor and demanded empathy. Not to be outdone, Saroo's adoptive parents, played by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham, deliver great performances. The movie is gorgeous and filled with beautiful establishment shots of India, and the film score perfectly blends in with every scene, tugging at the heartstrings.\n\nWhile a lot of this movie is fine, the bad gets pretty darn bad. Dev Patel was okay, but he was a huge downgrade from Sunny as the older version of Saroo. Personally, I would have rather seen Sunny nominated for the Oscar over Dev, but that wouldn't have sold with the Academy. Part of the reason Dev was a downgrade was because of his character's girlfriend, played by Rooney Mara. I've liked Mara in the past, but she was obnoxious and generally unlikable in this movie. The middle act, focusing on their relationship, was so melodramatic that it completely took me out of the movie, rendering the emotional finale ineffective in my eyes.\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of great things about Lion, especially its film score and the performances by Pawar, Kidman, and Wenham. However, convenient plot points and the lack of chemistry between Patel and Mara drag this movie down a bit too far. If you like the feel-good movies, you'll probably be able to overlook these facts. For me, I couldn't move passed Dev staring at a computer screen.\n\nFinal grade: C\n\n-Ben",

            "content": "Lion is directed by Garth Davis, and it stars Sunny Pawar, Dev Patel, Rooney Mara, David Wenham, and Nicole Kidman in a biographical film about a Hindi kid that got separated from his brother at a very young age, and when he got himself in a new home with an Australia family, he never stopped thinking about it and wants to find his way back home to find his mother and brother. This is the first movie out of all the Best Picture Nominations for 2016 where I got no knowledge from critics that I like watching, except for Brad Jones, but I didn't realize about it the day after I finished the film, and I haven't watch it, which I'll do this review first. So for this movie, let's get on it. I was starting to realize why Dev Patel was nominated for Best Supporting Actor as half the film is about Saroo Brierley in his young age, and the movie starts to get interesting when he gets alone as it felt realistic, and you feel sorry for the kid already that you wonder about how he's going to go through this. Sunny Pawar is great in it that I'm surprised this film is his debut as a child actor, and he gives off tons of emotional moments that will give a feel from the viewers. The writing by Luke Davies is well-written that connects the two stories very well, and understands about how Google Earth works. The second half is just as good as the first act as Dev Patel gives a great performance as he was trying to be happy here, but still can't shake the fact about his past after meeting some Indian people, and Nicole Kidman is also pretty good that she even has her great acting moment that's close to the end. The score by Hauschka and Dustin O'Halloran is very good that it sounded soothing and relaxing for the film. Critics say that the film is cliched, and I agree with them, but the way that the movie executed with a great story and has heart in it, felt like it's telling them for the first time. Lion is a fantastic film that I was glad it got recognized that got me to see it.",

Here we have a bibliographical, linear script that does not attempt to deceive the viewer with subjectivity or parallel timelines, as I said, he preaches for simplicity to tell the story of Saroo (Dev Patel), a 5 year old boy who gets lost in his Brother at a train station in Calcutta, and after being adopted by an Australian family tries to find his family 20 years later. The setting of the film in its first act is so honest and simple, it is extremely captivating and beautiful, director Garth Davis spends an air of attachment and complicity, blending the violence and innocence that is a beautiful thing, pity that his second act is the Opposite that, with a beautiful photograph in its first act, dark and highlighting the elements of the screen, the rest of the film opts for something lighter and blending the shades of blue with a simple track and a camera that is often used without a tripod The film technically only pleases. The performance of Sarro is wonderful, but Dev Patel does not impress as Saroo, he does not pass the air of lost or desperate and alone does not raise the dramatic charge, and were it not for the good construction of the script, Patel would not make us dry The eyes at the end of the film. We have here a movie that has a great first act, a second act too elongated with many repetitions of idea and bad construction of characters (Only Sarro is built) and a third that is short, but extremely beautiful and precise, and is always very sensitive Of the director showing pictures or videos of the events has put film, served to spend more wipes, \"Lion\" is a good movie that fulfills its role.",
