It just doesn't work. It is not that the cast is not good-because they are. New York City is an extra character in this movie and that is very good. The Direction and cinematography are subpar. The story and script are very weak. There are elements of religious and supernatural which make this an unusual police drama and thriller, but they aren't woven into the story well enough to make it cohesive and interesting enough to overcome the disappointment.",

There was no coherent plot, just a bunch of generic subplots about race and crime poorly stitched together. Everything was dragged out, dull, and depressing, and everyone was unlikeable and stereotypical, with only surface level depth. Keanu was supposedly the lead, but his character was pointless and did nothing the entire film, not even wanting to talk. The focus was on Ana de Armas speaking in Spanish about angels when she had in fact been sexually assaulted in the subway. Not predictable whatsoever given the constant bizarre hallucinations and rapidly deteriorating mental state... Definitely sensible to not see or be encouraged by friends/family to see any medical professional. Then the cops were, of course, corrupt, just like in almost every single film containing police. Points for originality there. The acting was atrocious from Keanu Reeves and mixed but average at best from everyone else, the action was a joke, the cinematography and visual effects were bland, the sets/props/costumes were equally boring, with the hallucination people looking ridiculous, and the soundtrack was utterly forgettable.",

            "content": "My understanding is that director Gee Malik Linton's version of this movie was so chopped up and altered by the studio that he withdrew his name from the project and used a pseudonym. His original film title was _Daughter of God_.\n_Exposed_ conflates a cop story (Keanu Reeves trying to find out who killed his partner) with Latin American magic realism (a young Hispanic lady keeps seeing angels, although they look more like something from a bad alien movie).\nSound confusing? It is, unapologetically so.\nThe acting in many scenes is awkward and stiff. Keanu Reeves walks through this movie like he's half dead and his face is paralyzed. Ana de Armas fares better as the young lady with the visions. She's at least somewhat believable, whereas Reeves is near-catatonic (He does wake up briefly in a couple of scenes).\nThe movie flips back and forth between the two stories, which are seemingly unconnected. To further screw things up, the young lady becomes pregnant, even though her husband has been serving in Iraq for the past year and she has (ostensibly) been with nobody else. Deeply religious, she calls it an immaculate conception. Also, Reeve's dead partner's wife seduces him. It's quite awkward, and it adds zilch to the story.\nEverything coalesces (rather quickly) in the final scenes. But the whole movie made me feel distanced. I just couldn't get involved.\n2 1/2 stars for good camera work. 2 1/2 stars off for the disjointed, impersonal mood. \nMakes me wonder how the original concept would have turned out if the studio hadn't insisted on messing with it.",

Leave all of Isabel's scenes, but remove her adult father's character, and add this - While she is experiencing the attack, have her flash back to a crime scene in the apartment as Elisa with bloody clothes, where the police chief's younger self is handling the case and sees the \"family photo\" . Add Elisa seeing the \"albino man\" to the end of that scene. Then cut back to Isabel when she and the homeless man are at the flashback of \"that night\". 3) ...This is the tweak that would have turned this movie into a smash hit ... End the movie with Another Call from Keanu to his son, and give him Isabel's dad's lines rewritten as, \" I love you ... and no will ever hurt you again.\" Then flash back to the scene between Keanu and Joey's wife, but show him putting some angry aggressive sex moves on the wife as he looked at the \"family photo\". Then cut back to present day and show a news cast of Isabel being named as a new suspect (Flash her photo) in more development on the case of Joey's murder, discovered by a fellow NYC detective (Flash Keanu's pic)... and End with a final cut to Joey's tearful wife watching this news cast in utter despair. Now, THAT would justify the title EXPOSED.  These few tweaks would have given connection to this terribly disjointed film. Just my 2 pennies.",

Also the title could have better expressed the spirit of the film.\n\nEdit: I just watched Daughter of God (aka the director's cut), and honestly I thought Exposed was better. DoG has some really choppy, clunky editing in many places. The repetition of the story of Se\u00f1or Salazar was way overdone and became monotonous, with a pretty mediocre ending. Also the movie over-explains the shocking reveal at the end regarding Elisa and Isabel. The actor that played the angel-being couldn't deliver the Spanish lines well. It was obvious that he doesn't really speak Spanish and therefore couldn't connect with his delivery and make it flow naturally. Yes, Exposed has some issues, but I'm still surprised that it got such abysmally low reviews.",

We're going to buy this film and add it to our 1000+ DVD collection. I would add that Ana de Armas, who is NOT interchangeable, saw her career skyrocket after this film. Okay, it's a detective story with supernatural elements. If you liked The Sixth Sense, you'll love this film even more, because you won't see the twist at the end coming, even watching it a second time.

There somehow two storylines going on and usually movies that do this tends to confuse people so easily. Luckily, I can catch with these kind of stuff in one go but let's not say that I can catch ALL the flaws and what not in one go. However, there are two huge problems about the story and I know they had to play into the story. The mysterious figures. One appears in the underground subway and then the other one who usually appears in the streets. This woman named Isabella somehow starts seeing these things and as much religious person that she is, she says it's a sign from God. There is a plot twist in that and it plays big time towards the end.\n\nI feel Keanu Reeves' character was quite underrated. Actually the whole movie was but I think his character was underplayed. The movie focuses more on Isabel and her struggle to some strange antics she's been experiencing. Suffice to say, it has to do with her childhood and it is \"exposed\" in the end as well.\n\nWhile I would rate it higher because of Keanu Reeves, I had to remind myself why this movie is the way it is. It's an okay movie but the cop investigation was lacking and only see glimpses of it. I might not have picked up on why and how Scott Galban's wife died and even why his kid is in Florida but I guess it's to have him away from the stuff that Scott has been dealing with his work. As for Isabella, she's a worn and torn character. You'll find her excuses comes in a tragic end but we'll never know what becomes of her.\n\nExposed is a good movie and if you're a fan of movies from Keanu Reeves, this shouldn't be something to pass up.

There are more substandard films than this, but having a big name like Keanu Reeves, it is a great disappointment. It was written and directed by an inexperienced filmmaker. That was a big challenge the production house has taken, and in the end it's a failed attempt. But that was not the actual reason for the disaster.\n\nMaybe the director's cut would have been better than this version. Because the actual film was a bilingual drama that reminds us classic cult films. But the production house decided to turn it into a money generating product. Due to that plan-B it went through the lots of cuts to turn it into a single story. In the end the 'lost in translation' happened. So that's answers why it was credited under a false director's name.\n\nIt is hard to give an opinion on the story, because it's a confusing narration due to imbalance in the genres which is originally meant for two different stories. The twist was taken straight out of another film, so that makes the conclusion was very silly. First of all, Keanu Reeves' character was next to nothing. I don't understand how he ended up in this project. If his side story was chopped off, it would have made a decent short film and vice versa. I am sure, 8 out of 10 would feel a letdown and the remaining 2 might like it or maybe fall into a confused state.\n\n3 1/2/10",

I was expecting some in depth investigating from Keanu Reeves character, Scatty, whose trying to find out who murdered his partner but it doesn't go any were for ages and the characters were pretty dull. The writing was also pretty bad and I personally thought that Keanu Reeves was the worse choice for the lead, mainly because the dialogue isn't that great and the basic concept dries up after a while. The other main character in the movie, Isabel (Ana de Armas), just seems to wonder around in a trance for an hour and a half, and when the plot unfolds, I wasn't that impressed. The tone from the beginning of the film is really glum, which doesn't help the slow pace which was set from the get go. There isn't any action through the whole film and I didn't really get the point of the little girl or the strange white person who kept on popping up out of nowhere. I know that Isabel is going through an traumatic episode in her life but I still didn't get her weird visions and strange behaviour. For a film that is supposed to be a suspense/thriller, I certainly didn't feel thrilled after watching it, and it just seemed like a waste of time and money. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up:\nAfter growing up listening to Big Daddy Kane's music, it was good to see that he was still alive but he really picked a terrible movie to star in. At 47 years old and with a successful Hip Hop career behind him, he has really starred in some poor movies, like the Metoer Man in 1993, Posse, Dead Heist, Love For Sale, Just Another Day, You're Nobody 'til Somebody Kills You, My Name Is Nobody and the upcoming Movie Madness. I'm yet to see if he really can act, mainly because his bad choice of projects but he definitely was one of the top rappers back in the day, with his unique style and suave personality. In this film, his character seemed a bit pointless because he was wrongly accused right from the beginning and you don't actually get to see him in his criminal element because he is constantly being watched by the FBI. Anyway, this movie was directed by Declan Dale who hasn't made a film before, or contributed to any project in the movie world. You can tell that his lack of knowledge when it comes to story telling, is his downfall and the fact that he wasted a decent cast, isn't the best way to kick off your career in cinema.\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their mystery/crime/dramas starring Keanu Reeves, Ana De Armas, Gabe Vargas, Christopher McDonald, Mira Sorvino, Big Daddy Kane, Sandy Tejada, Ariel Pacheco and Michael Rispoli. 2/10",

The other follows Ana de Armas who sees mysterious apparitions, believes she has had a miracle in her life and may hold the link to solve the murder of Keanu's partner. Let's start with the good in this movie, Keanu, carries himself with the air of a noir detective that feels his character has been doing the job for some time and has taken a toll. Mira Sorvino makes a couple brief but will acted performances as the widow of Reeve's fallen partner.  Poor editing and narrative direction hinders the two storylines from working cohesively. When it comes to the two characters intertwining at the end it comes off as weak due to the slow pacing and fragmentation leading up to the reveal. As the two stories unfold parallel to each other details of the detective's death reveal themes of police corruption, rape and drugs. Also it is good to note the movie features quite a bit of Spanish dialogue with English subtitling. The movie appears to be a victim of when studios get to involved in a film, from articles I read it seems Lionsgate re-edited most of the movie to center around Keanu Reeves after his success with John Wick, this makes it easy to see why it feels disjointed and why Director Gee Malik Linton put the movie under the pseudonym Declan Dale.",

            "content": "VIEWS ON FILM review by Jesse Burleson\n\nUnknown director (with a pseudonym to boot). Generic title. Big name stars who you sense are doing it for a paycheck. Released by way of video on demand instead of theatrical. Sound familiar? It should. If you've seen reviews for movies like The Prince or Vice, then Exposed (my latest write-up) is embedded in that category. Yeah it's lousy like the aforementioned vehicles but in a different way. Vice and \"Prince\" have a sense of coherency. You can mostly follow their every beat. Exposed is just messy. There were times when I didn't know what it was that I saw. So OK, what were you thinking Mira Sorvino? What were you thinking Michael Rispoli? And Christopher McDonald, what the heck?\n\nAnyway, watching this thing is like viewing two different films at once. I don't know how to classify it. You could call Exposed a nonprofessional indie. You could call it a crime drama/supernatural charade. Heck, you could claim it to be a foreign language flick starring Keanu \"whoa\" Reeves (huh?). No matter how you interpret things, there's 102 minutes here that feel like 3 hours. When its best performance is given by a washed-up, recluse rapper (Big Daddy Kane), you know the proceedings are in trouble. When its opening sequence takes forever and sets a bad precedent for what lies ahead, you know the proceedings are in trouble. And finally, when its director doesn't want to reveal his (or her) actual name, you know the proceedings are in trouble. Exposed can easily be renamed, Excruciating.\n\nSpeaking of said director, he may be a rookie or he may be a veteran. Either way, Declan Dale (or whatever his name is) lets you know it's amateur night right off the bat. It's clear from the opening credits (of Exposed) that he can't effectively set up a shot, can't frame a scene, doesn't know when to infuse a close-up, doesn't know where to put the camera, doesn't use a zoom out at the right time, and can't juggle his many, muddled subplots. Scenes in Exposed are either too long-winded or not nearly long enough. And Dale's editing team could have been a pack of monkeys and the audience wouldn't even know the difference. Tone is absent, dramatic momentum starts up only to get sucked into the wind, and laughable overacting comes on like gangbusters. I paid $6.99 to watch this movie on XFINITY. If I paid $1.50 for it on Redbox, it still would have been a bad investment.\n\nFilmed in an uncommon part of New York City, distributed by Lionsgate Premiere, and originally titled Daughter of God, Exposed jots back and forth to chronicle the lives of two different, combative characters. First we have Scott Galban (played by Keanu Reeves). He is your typical, doom and gloom detective. His wife passed away, his son has been taken from him, he has almost no friends, and his partner (Joey Cullen played by Danny Hoch) just got murdered in an underground subway. Galban against mild orders from his superior (Lt. Galway played by Christopher McDonald), investigates the reality of his partner's death. He goes around asking questions yet every witness he talks to, gets murdered. Second, there's Isabel de La Cruz (played by Ana de Armas). She's the only witness that Galban hasn't talked to yet. Her character is borderline schizo. She becomes pregnant by way of a miracle, she has visions of ghostly apparitions, there's a side plot about her husband being stationed in Iraq, and she ultimately wanders the film as though she's a lost puppy. Throughout Exposed, we as the audience see Isabel the most (even though her and Keanu's Scott are loosely connected). Many frustrating scenes involve Isabel, her family, and her friends constantly gabbing in Spanish (when all of them obviously speak English). As for Reeves, well we only discern his screen time in bits and pieces. His presence is never developed or consistent. Like I mentioned in the second paragraph, Exposed feels like you're watching two separate vignettes altogether. They're so unconnected from each other, it makes the film totally shapeless. When every plot element finally comes full circle (in the concluding clips), you feel the damage has already been done. Exposed \"exposes\" itself to be a real scrape. Rating: 1 and a half stars.\n\nOf note: A lot of death occurs in Exposed yet we never see it. Heck, we don't even view any of the actual aftermath. It's like the film is trying to be 1995's Se7en but is too lazy to explain how A led to B. Is it possible the studios didn't want to go over budget? Maybe. Is it possible director Dale didn't know how to make homicide scenes look believable? Maybe so. Or did the special effects crew run out of fake blood? Oh yeah, that's it. Yeesh! Also of note: I usually give Keanu Reeves a pass because a lot of moviegoers think he can't act. I've seen him do solid work in Point Break, Speed, and Street Kings. I know what he's capable of. In Exposed however, he hits a wall by showing us the ultimate, wooden moment. There's a scene where he sits in his police car, gets upset, shows frustration, yells at himself, and bangs his hands on the steering wheel. To say this is laughable would be an understatement.",

Lionsgate Premiere did this without the director's approval so the director removed his director credit from the film. The original director's cut focused on Dominican family and the primary protagonist Isabel. The director's cut also depicts the protagonist's ability to remain strong with the support of her Dominican step-family along with surreal undertones. \n\nLionsgate Premiere removed major scenes featuring black and Latino characters along with major chunks of Isabel's Dominican family life in Washington Heights. Cut by more than 25 minutes, the once dreamy-yet-haunting, female-centered drama is turned into a disjointed thriller with a flat unfinished ending. Some characters' parts are cut almost entirely, diminishing the effect of the final twist of the film and causing the ending to fall flat. The subplot about police corruption and brutality is diluted to make more time for Keanu Reeves to brood, an attempt to expand what was intended as a thin role for the sake of box office revenue. Surreal elements that made this movie special aren't in the final cut.

It's soon apparent that \"Exposed\" has a rather jumbled presentation. The movie uses multi perspective style and it does try to deliver heavy subject such as abuse, but it's ultimately too broken to create any appropriate connection.  \n\nThe two perspectives are too messy, as though the screenplay or editing is done sloppily. Keanu's point of view is that of noir detective, although the investigation moves so slowly and erratically. Meanwhile Ana de Armas plays as a troubled wife who might just see some apparition. From the color tone, the pace and even the script, these two stories are utterly different. \n\nIt's not to say that there's not an artistic goal in mind, it could have dealt with mature theme well, however the jarring shift is confusing to say the least. It would jump from festive vibe, to brooding case and suddenly to what seems to be psychological thriller with metaphor. This is a really odd direction and it doesn't have to be such, it feels as though the movie tries to needlessly overreach.\n\nBoth the leads perform admirably, in some instances Ana de Armas looks amiable and Keanu Reeves still has his appealing presence. However, the plot is chaotic, there would be incredibly slow development and subplots, yet it would hasten abruptly in mere minutes. The few segments from other angles don't really pan out in the grand scheme, while its intended twist is hampered by over saturation of horror genre, which is odd to see in crime drama.\n\nThis kind of sudden change is not uncommon, some thriller movies shifted to more action atmosphere for casual audience or some action flicks would be altered to accommodate more famous stars. Still, the extreme shift of tone here doesn't have any appeal instead it's only a distraction.\n\n\"Exposed\" could have a surreal depth for narrative, yet it's a just a confusing mess that barely has any charm and even that small spark is muddle with messy production.",
