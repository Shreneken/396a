Guided by a no-nonsense panther (Ben Kingsley) and a free-spirited bear (Bill Murray), the young boy meets an array of jungle animals, including a slithery python and a smooth-talking ape. Along the way, Mowgli learns valuable life lessons as his epic journey of self-discovery leads to fun and adventure.",

An actual fight to the death with sheer kann whereas the problem is only sorted in the second movie.\nOverall i thought the plot in the live action was better.\n\nTheir choice was to includes some of the songs were great homage to the original.\n\nSheeran Kan felt more evil and more of a beast. He was actually scary and not to be messed with. Example where he kills the alpha wolf.\nKing louie was intimidating in this version with his serious demeanor and sheer size. he did not laugh or giggle like he other version.\n\nMy biggest gripe would be baloo design.\nI thought everyone had a good character model but Baloo.\nBecause why does he look lik a american grizzly bear and not more blacnk and more like his cartoon design",

            "content": "The 1967 animated film to me is still one of Disney's best of the \"classic era\". This is not just nostalgia talking, quite a few childhood favourites have not held up, but 'The Jungle Book' is an example of one that has.\n\nExpectations were mixed for seeing this film. The trailer looked great, the voice cast is filled with enormous talent and the featurette was fascinating. It was just that, relating it to the other Disney live action adaptations, whether it was going to be one example of a re-boot that looked stunning, was well-written and performed, respected its original source material(s) and added its fresh spin, like 'Cinderella, or a well-made film with enough other decent elements to make it watchable but also one lacking in soul and charm, like 'Alice in Wonderland'.\n\nFortunately, 'The Jungle Book' is an even stronger example of the former, and is one of Jon Favreau's best films along with 'Iron Man'. Fans of the animation will love recognising the familiar characters and scenes and it was also really nice to see more of Rudyard Kipling's writing and story telling here, the ending being closer to that of the animated film. 'The Jungle Book' is wonderful on its own merits too, just like the Disney animated film was, which was a poor adaptation of the book but worked so well as a film on its own that it didn't matter.\n\nCriticisms for the film are very few. The first criticism is that Kaa's scene and screen-time is far too short, a great character like Kaa deserves far more than a mere five minutes or so. And it is a shame because it is a very suspenseful and hypnotic scene with some of the film's most striking visuals, and the deceptively maternal story teller approach was beautifully written and delivered. Regrettably, the other criticism was \"I Wanna Be Like You\". While one of the highlights of the animated film, and one of Disney's most iconic moments, because the scene is darker and King Louie more intimidating (in size and manner), also because it comes out of nowhere, the light-hearted fun of the song that worked so brilliantly before just doesn't fit here (if Christopher Walken really did desperately want to sing the song, it didn't show in his singing because he sounded uninterested and hesitant).\n\nOn the other hand, the film looks amazing. The rich, expansive cinematography is some of the best of the year so far and the scenery and settings are so vividly detailed and colourful, that reading that it was shot entirely in a warehouse was a shock. The rendering of the animals are staggeringly realistic, especially Shere Khan, Bagheera and the monkeys. Favreau directs with a keen eye for detail and spectacle, yet doesn't forget the drama, cast or the storytelling once. John Debney's music score is full of energy, atmosphere, warm orchestration and vibrant emotion, its referencing of familiar themes feeling nostalgic and affectionate rather than cheap. As for the songs in the film, although \"I Wanna Be Like You\" was a disappointment \"Bear Necessities\" fitted right in and was as good-natured and easy-going as one can hope and \"Trust in Me\" is worth listening to if you stay for the closing credits, Scarlett Johansson with her low-register, smoky yet sensual tone does a surprisingly good job with the song.\n\n'The Jungle Book's' script is very funny (Baloo getting the funniest lines, and some of them were hilarious) without being childish or simplistic while also easy to understand and thought-provoking, there is a good amount of depth too without being too dark or sugary sweet. The story moves quickly and is constantly enthralling, one thing it does better than the animated version is expanding on motivations and making characters more interesting (as great a villain as Shere Khan is in the animated film, his motivation to me seemed clearer here). The climax is dramatically satisfying and darkly tense.\n\nA great job is done with the characters also. They're not complex, but they are likable and interesting, are very true in personality to their animated counterparts and all serve a point in the storytelling, some like Shere Khan and the wolves expanded upon. It was easy to identify with Mowgli, Baloo is a breath of fresh air and to me a great villain is one that one can totally see why the villain is hated or feared but one can also understand their point of view, which is the case with Shere Khan (this is true of the animated film too, but as Shere Khan has more of a back story here it came through stronger to me). The cast were a talented one to begin with and their talents absolutely shine through. Newcomer Neel Sethi does very credibly as Mowgli, it is incredibly hard to react against nothing and apart from a few naturally stiff moments to begin with he handles all the different emotional elements very well. The superbly chosen vocal cast are even better.\n\nBill Murray was born for Baloo (sounding far more engaged than as Garfield), his relaxed but witty voice-work matching the character's easy-going, good-natured personality. Idris Elba effectively puts dread into one's heart as Shere Khan, he's silky, regal, charismatic and genuinely menacing, though George Sanders brought over the suavity and oiliness more. Ben Kingsley is a stern yet sympathetic Bagheera, and Christopher Walken, in a characterisation that is like a mix of mobster boss, Colonel Kurtz and Walken's own mannerisms, makes King Louie intimidating but also entertaining. Scarlett Johansson's voice work for Kaa is eerily sensual, Giancarlo Esposito is a dignified Akeela and Lupita Nyong'o's Raksha is movingly compassionate.\n\nIn conclusion, a truly great film. Works very well as a live-action re-boot and works even more as a film in general. An epic visually stunning adventure, told with fun, heart and depth. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Okay I get why the Director made it cause he wanted to make it more mature and grown up but comparing it to the original which was the last animated movie to bear Walt Disney's person touch is downright disappointing, and if Disney was still alive and saw this film he would have straight up walked out.  At over two hours long it gets way too boring and too many plots are going on they could have made it in an hour thirty and done better but nope they stretched it out and left too many things out. On top of that this movie is straight up living proof that Disney has little to no respect for the original animated movie.  By making a PG rated remake and stretching the run time to over two hours is absurd.  They ruined the jungle book with the sequel released in 2003 now this remake is an atrocity to the 1967 film and the characters that everyone else has loved.  It is not engrossing to watch and has little improvement over the original.  It's just a tarnished remake that has little value in the world of film.",

Knowing that the only real thing we are looking at is Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, is truly a wonder for the time. All the animal characters look photo realistic. Casting Bill Murray as Baloo was a terrific idea. Ben Kingsley is great as Bagheera, Idris Elba plays a menacing Shere Khan and I love Scarlett Johansson's take on Kaa. Now here is the problem: they tried to keep the musical aspect of the original animated feature. I love the music from the original, I believe the music made that movie great. But here it is gutted from its intended purpose and is only included for nostalgic reasons. Scarlett Johansson's version of \"Trust In Me\" is great, but they only used it during the end credits because they needed her character to be an exposition dump. That is a terrible use of Johansson's talent and the money they spent for her studio time to voice Kaa. I could rant about this film for quite awhile, but to sum up I think this film is only worth a watch if you're interested in the technical animation achievement that it represents.",

This movies special effects are so realistic, it’s hard to believe that nothing was shot on a set and it was all computer generated. The cast is complied of Hollywood’s finest actors and actresses, all lending their voices to these beautifully rendered computer generated animals. This film in my opinion delivers more emotion than the cartoon and also I think is a better movie than the original as well. This movie would suffer completely if the animals didn’t breathe and come to life the way they do.

From the individual strains of fur, to the types of animals included (I've done so much research on Indian wildlife today), you can really see the details of the cg effects.  Just watch the end credit sequence alone, and it'll prove it.\n\nThere are 3 huge improvements to this versus others: Sher Khan's face, King Louie, and the intensity of the animal fight scenes.  The movie isn't free of problems: I imagine someone will have issues with talking animals vs non-talking animals, that he'd have to learn the language (so how would he ever understand Sher Khan or Baloo?).\n\nIf anything, I think the writing took a hit.  Where the original had a subtle but strong fables sequencing to it (sort of modular moral stories with shifting focus on characters), this is structured much closer to how many video game stories are structured, serialized chapters with some level of power creep and shifting focus of environment and goals but all focused on Mowgli.  And I don't think the writing is bad, but this Jungle kid (never actually reveals his backstory, somewhat of a relief honestly) is performing clean engineering using vines and pulleys and armor (that wouldn't work) with calculated positioning.  I understand that some people just have talent for some things, but I had to question whether or not I could do the same thing.  I could, but I'd have to do it different ways.\n\nAnd in all fairness some of the stupid /inconsistent things he gets up too, even though he's a \"take charge\" Mowgli in this version really got to me: I was literally cheering for Sher Khan at certain points.\n\nUltimately I had a good time with it, and I think most people and possibly their pets will too (my cats were interested for a while).",

Some of the emotional moments really worked for me. Also, I like Bill Murray as Baloo and Christopher Walken as King Louie. Also, there are only 2 (technically one) song numbers that are decently funny. However, the technology is the highlight of the film.

It is truly a masterpiece of a movie. \n\nNeel Sethi (Mowgli) gives an amazing performance given he's interacting with CGI animals that aren't in front of him. Of course it helps when your voice acting cast are actual actors. Idris Elba as the tiger Shere Khan, is perfect, you really feel his vengeful spirit. Bill Murray as the lazy but lovable bear Baloo is hilarious. Ben Kingsley kills it as the wise panther (or leopard?) Bagheera. Scarlett Johansson as the seductive giant snake Kaa was really good. Christopher Walken gives a creepy but awesome performance as the giant Orangutan King Louie.\n\nThe reality is that this movie was PROPERLY CASTED and you feel the results throughout the whole adventure because the animals do feel alive with emotion. You never feel like someone is just reading a script in a booth (like you do many times in Lion King) and that helps deliver the message of \"accepting others even though different\" very well. \n\nThe story is not a complete copy of the original (unlike Lion King) which helps give it more freshness. I don't know how director Jon Farveau's (he directed both Jungle Book and Lion King) two movies could feel so apart from each other in quality. Perhaps Disney executives got involved in the casting of the most recent movie? The original Jungle Book is not a very popular animated film in my opinion, so maybe that's why Disney selected ACTORS NOT SINGERS for this one. \n\nFINAL REVIEW: 9.5 out of 10.

Mowgli has to flee from the wolfpack and ends up in another part of the jungle where he makes new friends and enemies. Once Mowgli hears of a tragic event that happend back at his home with the wolfs, he goes back to fight Shere Khan with the Red Flower (aka fire).\n\nEverything, and I mean, everything in this movie looked so real. I know most of it is animated but I really got confused sometimes, the special effects were amazing. I'm very interested in seeing how exactly they filmed everything. Neel Sethi (who plays Mowgli) did a great job, when you think about it, he probably had to act with a lot of green walls and shapes. The parts where he had to talk weren't sometimes as great, but I think he really did a good Mowgli. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and most of the time I'm not very impressed with the 3D, but I loved it in this movie! There were a few times when water came at you and even stuck on the \"camera\", I really liked that, it gave even more dimension.\n\nThe voice actors really fitted their animals, or the other way around. It was just right. Bill Murray as Baloo brought some fun laughs. All the animals in The Jungle Book looked magnificent, and they where so large. It was really impressive. All the nature was so detailed, the home of King Louie looked really great. King Louie looked really impressive as well, and I don't know if it's just me, but when I looked at him I felt like I was really looking at Christopher Walken (That doesn't really sound like a compliment now does it, haha), his eyes just had that little something in there, I don't know. I liked it. Although I didn't really liked really liked that scene in particular, it didn't brought much to the story. I can't really remember the old Jungle Book, so I can't really judge story wise, but I really liked it and it felt like the movie ended before I even realized it.\n\nI really enjoyed watching The Jungle Book. Everything looked so beautiful and realistic, I can only imagine how many great things they can do with this technology. It was one of the first times I really listened and enjoyed the music in a movie, it fitted perfectly and gave an even more wonderful experience to it all.",

I must credit Neel Sethl (Mowgli). His performance is very strong, especially when you consider what he was up against. He had to lead a major film while only interacting with CGI characters around him. Thatâ(TM)s a tough ask but the kid nails it. He showed a wide range of emotion and delivered his lines well. The voice cast is very strong with Idris Elba (Shere Khan), Sir Ben Kingsley (Bagheera), Bill Murray (Baloo), and Giancarlo Esposito (Akela) doing the strongest work. \n\nWeaknesses: As noted, this was a more mature version of the story. That worked in some places but made others awkward. King Louis (Christopher Walken) came across strangely for one. For another, the music in the movie lacked. Thereâ(TM)s not a lot but the songs from the original are fun and memorable. In this one, they lose everything that makes them enjoyable and are easily forgettable. I wish we got more from Kaa (Scarlett Johansson). The character is a key part of the original story and a decent piece of the animated film, yet it relegated to a single scene here.

I'm not sure if this was the result of having a snowflake generation in today's time but after all you conquer the rotten world of humans with humour. Characters are depressing, even Baloo and are one dimensional. While the original attempted to place moral values in every frame of it's master piece for young and old this seemed to throw all of it out of the window but a change which I couldn't get over which made it even for the worse, was that they changed the snake from male to female. If the film producers tried to get themselves out of controversy then why did they decide to represent the snakes role with a womans voice instead?! For me that's just backwards thinking.\nDo yourself a favor and just watch the original",

Sure, having Jon Favreau at the helm was promising, but how could they possibly bring this to life without being extremely, well, bad. The answer is with dazzling CGI sets, an amazing voice cast and a good effort from newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli; they not only made it possible, but did it to a degree that would be difficult to improve upon. Sure, the CGI isn't quite photo-realistic yet and the whole thing was missing the familiar light-hearted, silly feel to it that the original animated classic had (although the scene with Baloo and Mowgli singing 'Bear Necessities' captured it perfectly), it was still pretty darn good.\n\nGreat effort Disney, looking forward to more live-action stuff.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it looks like Disney decided to re-make an old classic.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Can you re-make a new classic? Let s recap The Jungle Book.\n\nSCOTT: We meet Mowgli (Neel Sethi), a young man-cub who was left for dead in the jungle and then rescued by a black panther named Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). Mowgli is raised by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and her pack of young wolf-cubs. The young boy tries to act like a wolf but on occasion he can t help showing the cleverness of a human. During this particular year, the dry season hits the jungle hard. All the animals call a truce so that they can all drink safely at the ever-shrinking watering hole.\n\nGREG: That s when Shere Khan arrives and declares that there s not enough room in this jungle for him and the man cub. Once the truce is over he wants young Mowgli turned over to him. But Baheera decides to return the boy to the man-village so that he can be among his own kind. And so begins the boy s odyssey.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, I have to admit, I greeted the arrival of this movie with skepticism and cynicism. I m a big fan of Disney s original 1967 version of The Jungle Book, and I saw no need to revisit such hallowed, near-perfect ground. Well, I m here to tell our readers that as fabulous as the original movie was, this 2016 version is even more wondrous and spectacular. I m reluctant to call any movie flawless, but this film was damn near perfect. I m talking about character development, hero s journey, supporting characters, CGI effects, you name it. I was dazzled and beyond satisfied.\n\nGREG: Yeah, The Jungle Book was a much more sophisticated bit of animation than its predecessor. You will believe a tiger can talk. However, there were moments when I wondered if Mowgli was animated himself. When a film is clearly a cartoon (as was the 1967 version) you aren t thrown out of the story by such questions. But there were times when I was asking myself  is this Mowgli a CGI or not?  And in those moments I was looking at the technology and not the story. It was a bit of a distraction. But on the other hand, when you compare to a movie like Zootopia where the characters are animated - Jungle Book seems light-years ahead. The animals looked like lions and tigers and bears. Also, the story itself is subtler than the original. The original story has Mowgli going from animal to animal trying on their lifestyle to see if he fits. Ultimately, Mowgli finds the man-tribe and realizes this is where he fits in. Bears should be with bears, and boys with boys. But that message doesn t fit with 21st century sensibilities. In 2016, Mowgli returns to his wolf pack. He is a member of a blended family and he is at home with his differences. He draws strength from the variety of the animal kingdom and he takes his place as an equal among different animals. It s a more complex message.\n\nSCOTT: The heros journey is compelling and non-traditional in some ways. It follows the classic journey in that Mowgli is sent away from his home and then encounters his bear friend Baloo and a couple of villainous obstacles in the form of the snake Kaa and the orangutan King Louie. Usually a hero is missing some inner quality that he must obtain in order to triumph. The Jungle Book turns this formula upside-down by identifying his human intelligence as his fatal flaw. At the beginning of the film, the animals with whom Mowgli lives are critical of his humanity and try to drill it out of him. It s also one of the reasons why Shere Khan wants him gone. But rather than shed this quality, Mowgli stays true to himself and uses his human cleverness to help himself and others. In fact, at the film s climax, it is Mowgli s ingenuity that saves him from Shere Kahn. Thus we have an interesting hero s journey that turns the hero s transformation on its head by underscoring the importance of not changing as a means of completing the journey. Instead of needing to find his missing inner quality, Mowgli has already been in possession of it and must hang onto it despite pressures to abandon it. For me this makes his hero path fascinating and unique.\n\nGREG: That s an interesting distinction. Mowgli gets many mentors in this story. Of course there s Akela from the wolf pack, and Bagheera, later Baloo shows Mowgli how to enjoy the easy life. Ultimately, Mowgli listens to his inner self and combines all his mentors into a whole. I enjoyed The Jungle Book more than I expected. Disney has taken animation to a new level with the photo realism of the jungle animals. I was occasionally distracted by trying to determine if I was looking at a real person or a CGI image, but other than that I was drawn into this story and completely enjoyed myself. I give The Jungle Book 4 out of 5 Reels. Mowgli makes for an interesting hero. He starts out sheltered and naive and grows to become mature and confident. It was a gradual process and enjoyable to watch. I give Mowgli 4 out of 5 Heroes. The mentors in this story, including the unwritten code of the wolf pack, gave Mowgli the direction he needed to overcome his lack of confidence and allowed him to grow into the person he was destined to be. I give the mentors in The Jungle Book 4 out of 5 Mentors.  Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: You re right about the richness of the mentorship in this movie, and I have some observations to make about it before launching into my ratings. We re learning that heroes receive assistance from many different types of  helpers , for lack of a better term. A mentor is one such helper, and we define a mentor as an older figure who serves as the hero s teacher. Sometimes these helpers assume a parental role; in this film, Akela plays that role with Mowgli. Sometimes these helpers are guides who know the terrain and who lead the hero to the special world; here Bagheera assumes that role. These guides could be called Charons, named after the ferrymen in Hades who guided people between worlds across the river Styx. Other helpers are bodyguards who offer physical protection for the hero; this role aptly describes Baloo the bear. Still other helpers are coaches who physically train the hero; Akela and Bagheera both share those duties here. As you ve pointed out, Greg, mentoring can also come in the form of an internalized code of conduct; the wolves code in this film plays a pivotal role in steering Mowgli toward noble behavior. So we have physical, transportational, parental, and didactic teachers all helping our hero survive the jungle and defeat Shere Khan. The Jungle Book is one of the richest mentor/helper stories we ve encountered in the movies in 2016. Overall, this movie is a true gem, one of Disney s finest offerings of the past decade. This coming-of-age story is as old as storytelling itself, centering on a hero who must find his true identity. Mowgli cannot be trained to become a wolf, although he certainly makes the effort. His journey is a path toward manhood, and only through defeating the evil Shere Khan can his humanity be revealed. Every aspect of this movie is stirring and triumphant. It s Reel Heroes Hall of Fame material to me, and so I m more than happy to award this film the full 5 Reels out of 5. As I m mentioned, the hero s journey is cleverly turned on its head, with Mowgli s apparent flaw of  cleverness  being precisely the quality that must be cultivated for Mowgli to achieve success on his journey. So ironically, the transformation that our hero s friends implore him to undergo at the beginning of the movie is exactly what he must avoid undergoing in order to succeed on his journey. Mowgli is a wonderful hero on a classic journey in every sense of the word. He merits the full 5 Heroes out of 5. I needn t delve again into the rich assortment of mentor-like characters who assist our young hero on his journey. These characters are an inspired collection of teachers with unique and appealing personalities, and they help Mowgli emotionally, mentally, and physically. They are among the best mentors in the movies we ve seen this year, rivaling those seen in Eddie the Eagle I award Mowgli s helpers a Mentor rating of 5 out of 5. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:",

Featuring the voice talents of Bill Murray, Idris Elba, Christopher Walken, and Scarlett Johansson, the film has an impressive cast.  And the computer animation is exceptionally good and remarkable photorealistic (though the seams show from time to time).

This movie has set the standard for CGI, it's very hard to tell what is real and what is CGI, but it's all stunning. It's a fantastic adaptation of the original story, and includes just enough references and nods to the animated classic for us old folks that remember it. It follows the same basic structure of the animated film, but this version is much darker. It ain't just a romp through the jungle, Mowgli is in real danger at all times, and the danger is palpable. The story itself is still pretty standard and can even get a little dull, but director Jon Favreau has done an excellent job of keeping it moving and introducing elements to keep the viewer entranced. (And has anyone else noticed that this story is exactly the same as \"The Lion King\"?? Seriously, think about it, it's identical in structure and themes). As a fan of the animated film, it was hard for me to hear other people voicing these characters, but I have to admit they are really wonderful... especially Ben Kingsley as Bagheera and Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who are purrrfect for those characters (I'm sorry, I couldn't resist!!!). I missed the great Phil Harris as Baloo, but Bill Murray was a great pick for how this Baloo is written. The exception is Christopher Walken as King Louie. While the animated King Louie was more of a comical good-time character, this version is really menacing, and Walken's quirky, New-York-accent-heavy voice was just too comedic for the character (I loved the \"More Cowbell\" reference though!). This adaptation will certainly be hailed as the definitive \"Jungle Book\" film, and I wouldn't expect a reboot anytime soon. P.S. Stay for the closing credits, they are really clever, and you get to hear the full versions of the revamped songs.",

Mowgli leaves the pack and makes for the nearest human settlement, but this isn't enough for Shere Khan, who is determined to see him dead.\n\nBased on the Rudyard Kipling novel and with roughly the same central plot as the famous 1967 version, this is not in the same league as that version.  While the 1967 one had a wonderfully innocent, feel-good vibrancy to it, aided by some great, stick-in-your-head songs, this version is much darker and far less energetic.  While this is not necessarily a bad thing it just doesn't work as well for the story.  The songs are what carried the 1967 version along and made it so memorable, and, but for two tunes, the 2016 version is music-less.   \n\nHaving decided to make a dark drama, director Jon Favreau then tries to introduce comedy/lightheartedness, in the form of Baloo, and this jars with the remainder of the movie, feels forced and largely falls flat.    \n\nOn the plus side, the CGI is great (though that is a given for a 2016 movie). \n\nOverall, mildly entertaining.  Do yourself a favour: watch the 1967 version instead.  (Never thought I'd find myself preferring a musical version of a movie to a largely-non-musical version, but there it is).",

The CGI was awful, the animals didn't move correctly (I'm not including them talking, obviously that requires a suspension of disbelief since animals don't talk) and they were... rubbery and unnatural... it was just unpleasant looking. It never looked like the kid was ever actually interacting with real things, it was more like Space Jam for me only at least with Space Jam it is supposed to look and be ridiculous so you can just laugh it off. Aside from the CG the story was just... boring and forgettable.\nI'll be the first to admit I don't really love CG but I can get over it if it has a purpose and is really well done, like Gollum, he is freaking awesome looking and feels so real that I can easily suspend disbelief and buy into Gollum actually being there. Now this is half because Andy Serkis is amazing and half because they actually did a great job with the animation. This movie, on the other hand, was just a mess and was horribly unpleasant to watch.

Directed by Jon Favreau, starring Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Christopher Walken, Lupita Nyong'o, Bill Murray, Giancarlo Esposito, Scarlett Johansson, and introducing Neel Sethi. \n\nThe best way I would describe this movie is certainly as a rollercoaster of emotions. I have not read the book, but making a comparison with the last movie, I believe the story is well preserved. It starts a bit stressful, full of chases and dangerous tasks. While having the expected introductions, we meet Mowgli, a man-cub living in the jungle. And Bagheera, a panther who entrusted the boy to the pack of wolves that raised him. The characters are well developed, the actors did an amazing job capturing their essence in a deep story about teamwork, family, and friendship. Friendship overcoming obstacles, and bonds stronger than stone. \n\nThe story is about family and friendship, about growing up and having the adventure of a lifetime. Mowgli, learns to accept himself for what he is and understands that sometimes you don't know best, but still can do good and help those you love. \nNature is always the greatest teacher, and it will never cease to amaze me particularly how it was captured from the landscapes to traditions and laws. In my head, I want to believe that the water truce is something that really happens in the Jungle, and all animals pay their respects to elephants. \n\nOn the other hand, I must say that the animation is superb, I really didn't know where reality ended and the animation started. So, the morning after watching it, I went on YouTube to look for some insight. Blue screens everywhere! Oh, what a great time to be alive! Simply amazing. \n\nI highly recommend this picture, I suppose that some of you have seen it already, but for all of you out there who haven't, please go! Right now, stop what you're doing go watch it!\n\nFrom my blog: filmpressionist.blogspot.com",

So while the eye is trained on marveling at the wonderful graphics like the ruffles of feathers or individual strands of hair or oddly accurate mouth movement for the animals who speak, all that together makes for one expensive show.\n\nAt just over 90 minutes, The Jungle Book is a short-lived wonder.  Most of our time is spent with Neel Sethi as Mowgli while he traverses the jungle on two feet while his \"brethren\" paw around on all fours.  It really is like watching an animated movie come to life.  His interaction with each beast, whether it's hugging or stroking or bumping into, makes you wonder if he really did this with actual animals!  The short run time also keeps us from fully developing certain characters from the books like Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) or King Louie (Christopher Walken), but we get a ton of fun with Baloo (Bill Murray), Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) and one of the best animal/human villains, Shere Khan (Idris Elba).\n\nThe Jungle Book has opened up a new phase of remakes in Hollywood.  We'll see classics like The Lion King, Mulan and others roll into this 'live-action' genre soon enough, but if they can match what The Jungle Book did aesthetically pound for pound, we'll be in for a treat.",

            "content": "While, like any child since the 1970s, I have seen the 1967 Disney's The Jungle Book, it has been a fair number of years, and all that really stuck is \"The Bare Necessities\" and some chatter from Cub Scouts. But even without a deep bond with the most famous adaptation, the live-action redux seemed unnecessary from the trailers for one reason: its grimness. Check out the original trailer again, and feast yourself on that smorgasbord of animal scowling. Notably, it ends with Baloo lazily swimming down the river, and while it certainly has some unnecessary action and scare elements to it, it still has the same feel-good spirit in its veins as the animated version, putting a just-fresh-enough spin on the material to justify double-dipping.\nThe decision to go half-and-half with CGI and live-action pays off rather well, immediately distinguishing it visually from it predecessor, and with high-quality animation that only rarely betrays its true computerized nature. It's still a bit off-putting the first time a panther opens its realistically rendered mouth and speaks, but its easy enough to get over. The voice cast is mostly excellent and occasionally eclectic; Bill Murray as Baloo the bear and Christopher Walken as King Louie the monkey have no reason to really work, but Murray's amicability and laid-back delivery suit Baloo perfectly, and Walken's disjoint mafioso delivery saves what's otherwise the least essential part of the film. Scarlett Joahnsson's Kaa appears only briefly, but re-affirms her as a surprisingly stunning vocal character actor, an inviting yet otherworldly presence. Idris Elba is fierce as Shere Khan, although his accent breaks through distractingly at times. While the film wisely decided not to be a musical, \"The Bare Necessities\" does make an appearance. While its not the show-stopper it was in the original, Murray's laid-back approach suits the film perfectly. Less perfect is the in-film brief interlude of King Louie singing \"I Wanna Be Like You\", which distracts and clashes tonally. But some of songs are re-done with the movie cast for the credits, showing that the cast would have been more than up to the challenge had they gone for a straighter remake.\n\nWhile it is less of an issue than the trailers made it out to be, the new Jungle Book is still aimed at an older audience than the original (maybe 10 year olds instead of 5 year olds). It makes scary characters out of not only Shere Khan, but King Louie and Kaa. The characterizations work, but often end up devolving into action sequences the pile up to make the back half slightly overstuffed. While I would not want to deprive the world of Walken as King Louie, the sequence really could have been excised, particularly its action denouement. But Favreau brings some art to it all, staging some great shots of the beasts at his disposal (I'm a big fan of the scene where Shere Khan confronts the wolf pack). And as overused as the action tropes are, the message that being able to tie a knot makes you a worthy adversary to something with the sharpest claws is certainly one worth sharing with your local Cub Scouts.",

There was not a single moment the camera was still, it was always moving about, which really added to the sense that everything in this jungle is teeming with life. The director Jon Favreu (who did Iron Man) made some brilliant choices which lead to some truly beautiful shots. I'm not a huge fan of CGI but the animation work in this film was sublime and bar a few minor points, everything felt so real. It really was a visual marvel and I regret not seeing this on the big screen in 3D when I had the chance. \n\nThe cast was a huge draw and I was initially worried some of the major talent they had would be wasted but this was certainly not the case. Each actor brings amazing life to these familiar characters with Bill Murray as Baloo being a particular standout, Murray's trademark humour really lending itself to the character. Newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli was also amazing, especially as this was his first film and he had to interact with characters who were not really there. I hope we see more from this talented young kid. \n\nThe modern take on the Classic Disney film's songs were also wonderful, and who knew Bill Murray and Christopher Walken had such great voices? \n\nAs you can tell, I loved this film. In a year ruled by rushed and unimpressive sequels, remakes and reboots, this film is truly one of the best films 2016 has had to offer. I recommend this to everyone. It truly is a bear necessity to watch!",

You can end up with wonderful movies like the new Cinderella and you can end up with pointless, hopeless movies like Maleficent. But I have faith in what Disney is producing at the moment. They seem to be the master story tellers of our time. The Jungle Book was simply terrific. The acting from the one human and the voice acting was splendid. The characters were so loveable or so menacing depending on what they were trying to convey. I loved the world that Disney has created with this movie. The wolves have an oath that they say, the jungle has a truce that happens in times of drought, each character has history and some characters only meet for the first time during the movie because the jungle is a big place. It is so well thought out. Disney classics are beautiful to watch and remember how great they were and how important they were in movie history. But overall they are not amazing stories. The animated Jungle Book is really not a very well made movie, it just has catchy songs. This new movie however is far better and deserves its own place in being a modern classic.",

            "content": "The Jungle Book: Is a Movie That Will Captivate the Viewers Heart\n\tThe Jungle Book remake was made in 2016 and the original animated Disney version was aired in 1967. The director of the new film was Jon Favreau. The cast's major actors for this film include Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, and Scarlett Johansson. Neel Sethi who played Mowgli, the young boy, got his break-out role with this film. The character of Mowgli was the only human in the film since the other characters are all CGI animals. The film was full of emotion, suspense and amazing CGI effects. Everyone that was involved with this film did a superb job of making the treasured Walt Disney's 1967 version come to life. The movie's purpose was to captivate the heart of its viewers by giving a unique emotional tie to each character in a way that is different from the animated version. The movie's central analysis makes the reader ask the question of \"what should humans relationship be with wild animals and how far should that relationship go?\" \n\tMowgli was found as a boy by Bagheera (Ben Kingsley), a black panther. Bagheera takes the young boy to a group of animals, a pack of wolves, who he knows he can trust to raise the young boy. The wolves raise Mowgli as one of their own while Bagheera watches over him at a distance throughout Mowgli's life. Mowgli meets a best friend during his travels in the form of a bear named Baloo, as voiced by Bill Murray. The bear encourages Mowgli to view the jungle as a relaxing place and to understand that there is more to life than living by the rules. The movie has multiple villains that the animals in the jungle as well as the audience are afraid of. One villain was a human-hating tiger, Shere Khan (Idris Elba).  He's out for vengeance against humans and once he learns about Mowgli, he decides to not rest until the boy is dead. The second villain is a python named Kaa voiced by Scarlett Johansson who uses hypnosis on her prey. The red flower (fire) serves as another villain and plays a major role in the films plot symbolizing fear and power. For example, King Louie, an orangutan, voiced by Christopher Walken desires the red flower which he thinks Mowgli has or can create. The dynamic personalities within this film provide entertaining characters that the audience is connected to.\n\tThe film starts out full of suspense and lets the audience immediately see the pretty colors of the jungle. When I watch this film, I see and feel darkness, happiness, family, friendship, fear, power, beauty, and fear of the unknown. A strength of the movie is that the director stayed true to the characters and plot in comparison to Disney's 1967 version of the film. I believe the reason why this movie is so impactful is because it brings the audience's fears to reality. A weakness of the film is that certain parts of the movie were dark and not suitable for younger audience. Why did the director decide to take this route? Some might say that younger children are becoming used to darker scenes and this movie did not seem scary. \n\tIn conclusion, this movie will leave a lasting impression on its audience leaving them wanting more. I strongly recommend this film to teenagers and adults but, depending on how young a child is, parent discretion could be advised. The CGI in this film is purely unbelievable and is enough to make any movie goer see the film. Lastly, the movie makes the reader question what human relationships with wild animals should include and how dangerous we are to their lives.",

        {
            "content": "Though not too fond of the reboot trend in current Disney films, with The Jungle Book earning massive critical acclaim there was no way of missing it.\n\nThe Jungle Book (1967) was one of my favourite Disney animations as a child even though I had never read Ruyard Kipling's original source novel. So admittedly I was hesitant at the announcement of a live-action reboot. However, Jon Favreau's continuous accomplishments as a film director gave him enough status to earn the role of director in my view. Having been released to worldwide positive reception, I must contend that I did not find the same magical experience as countless other viewers. And frankly, The Jungle Book has far greater ambitions than reboots such as Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Malificent (2014). It does insist on turning the story into a darker adventure film with a climactic battle as the reboot trend demands, but at the same time it desires to be a fun tribute to the original Disney film with the same lighthearted charm. For all its gracious attempts, the ultimate result is a really inconsistent one.\nThere isn't any real story development in The Jungle Book. Structured like a series of vignettes with one different setting after another unfolding with the same protagonist in every scene to tie everything together. Audiences are taken on a journey through a visual-effects constructed world of CGI animals but little actual consistent development in the narrative. The story cuts between this and some sporadic sequences depicting Shere Khan discussing the political backdrop of the animal kingdom, failing to tie these two narrative together all that nicely. Essentially, the story oscillates between Mowgli's adventures with several different animals and a series of dull talkative moments. Politics aren't likely to be the interest of a young audience, but in a means to reach out to them the political dialogue of The Jungle Book is a little too simplistic in exploring its themes to be sufficiently innovative.\nBut what's more frustrating is the fact that The Jungle Book doesn't offer any kind of real comedic flow. While the intense atmosphere captures the reality of surviving in the jungle's harsh conditions and evading predators, the story forgets that it is a fantasy. It's based on a Disney film about a boy in the jungle surviving with his animal friends, and yet at the same time it really insists on maintaining the darker elements of its source material. The ambition to combine both is never an easy one, but as much as Jon Favreau tries he just cannot form a smooth hybridity from these elements. Instead, the film succumbs to bricolage and ends up a construction of several elements that exist independent of each other. The Jungle Book consistently changes its tone and it's narrative direction without ever developing its story in any major direction, and this can prove really jarring. The main source of comic relief in the film should be the loveable bear Baloo, especially since he is portrayed by comedic legend Bill Murray. Unfortunately Baloo's dialogue is too simplistic without being all that clever or emphasing his individual charm. Relying too much on a self-aware sense of humour, Baloo makes simplistic jokes and then keeps reminding everyone that he's just made that joke. He milks a cheap sense of humour for far too long in The Jungle Book while relying on his cutesy charm to support him along the way, but it wears thin extremely quickly. There are essentially no other characters intended to be funny in the story and so when the one who should be bringing the laughter comes up short, it's clear that the film has a severe problem. In essence, The Jungle Book lacks enough innovative drama to explore its story in the best manner possible while also coming up short on humour.\nHowever, The Jungle Book makes for an unforgettable stylish experience. Since the story is essentially Life of Pi (2012) on land, the demand for visuals to be up to the same standard is clear. Jon Favreau's mastery of visual style is at some of its finest in The Jungle Book because he creates an entire universe on one big green screen. With tremendous detail for realism yet a passion for the cartoonish colour of a Disney film, The Jungle Book builds a magnificent universe that is both extremely convincing in its realism and a magnificent experience of fantasy at the same time. The imagery in the film is unforgettable, and Jon Favreau even experiments with surrealism during the scene where Mowgli is hypnotised by Kaa. This sequence has the sophistication of Salvador Dali's work on Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945) with its own stylish distinction. The entire spectacle is supported by a magnificent musical score which maintains elements of George Bruns' score for the original Disney animated film while also having the tense sophistication of its own right. Occasionally the abundance of visual effects leave moments which are obviously not shot on location, but the sporadic nature of these lesser stylish moments fail to stand up in comparison to the superior moments of true visual glory in the film. The Jungle Book is a brilliant experience of imagery and music which will prove powerful enough to distract many viewers from the story flaws.\nThe real endeavour of the entire experience is the way that the film characterises King Louie. While he was merely a friendly Orangutang once upon a time, Jon Favreau's version depicts him as the long-extinct Gigantopithecus. His stature makes him all the more intimidating, and given that he is supposed to be the king of the Jungle this seems so much more appropriate. King Louie is a really frightening presence without being too scary for anyone's good, and he provides a really intense segment to the story. King Louie has the greatest animation of any of the characters. All the animals in the film have amazing detail to their design and movements which is some of the most realistic \n Christopher Walken's voice performance in the role proves to capture the role perfectly, grasping the part to characterise him like the King of crime. However, the presence of King Louie's song \"I Wanna Be Like You\" doesn't make sense. When he is dictating his role in the jungle and his demands to Mowgli, he slowly progresses into the song through delivering the words in a spoken word manner. Had he just completely spoken the entire song like a spoken word piece then it would have worked very smoothly, especially considering the nature of Christopher Walken's line delivery. But it was just awkward when pushed into a narrative that is trying to be a lot more serious, especially within the context of this scene. This song played out much better in the ending credits because the musical nature of it didn't break away from the reality of the scene this time, rather just present to encourage a fun closing tune for audiences. Frankly, the entire film is far too serious for musical numbers to have any real presence in the film, particularly one coming from the Godfather of the Jungle who should be more serious than anyone else. Given that King Louie is actually terrifying with the best characterisation of the film, this disruption can prove very frustrating. But luckily enough, the positive aspects of King Louie's characterisation overshadow the lesser ones, and he stands out among the cast.\nNeel Sethi's lead performance is a decent one. It is clear that he is an inexperienced actor, and to make a feature film debut in a Hollywood blockbuster that constructs both its universe and characters out of computer generated image is an immeasurable challenge. Neel Sethi's dedication to the character proves strong in many parts because his parkour-trained physical acting really makes the universe come to life while his interactions with the CGI characters really make their existence seem legitimate. However, his actual charisma is limited. There isn't any major characterisation of Mowgli outside of using a generic hero archetype that seems like a combination between Tarzan and Piscine Molitor \"Pi\" Patel from Life of Pi. It's clear that Neel Sethi is inexperienced because he fails to add any distinctive charm to the part, but his genuine engagement with the universe is very tenacious. Neel Sethi has his hits and misses in The Jungle Book, but there isn't much reliance on the quality of his performance to carry the film so it functions well enough.\nBill Murray is certainly worth praising. On the surface he sounds like the perfect casting decision for the role of the iconic loveable bear Baloo, and he fulfills that prophecy. The humour isn't up to the caliber of a comedic legend of Bill Murray's sizeable credibility, but the man's natural charm and friendliness gives the character the warm and fuzzy feeling that fans have come to expect. He uses his natural likability to create his own version of the character while also harkening back to the days of Phil Harris' portrayal in the original Disney movie. Bill Murray is a perfect casting decision in The Jungle Book.\nIdris Elba and Ben Kingsley contribute sohisticated voice efforts, but one cannot help but feel that they would have been more suited to each other's roles. Scarlett Johansson also manages to capture the perfectly slick and seductive tone of voice for Kaa.\n\nThe Jungle Book maintains a talented voice cast and some top-notch production values, but the segmented and underveloped story combined with a tonal inconsistency and insufficient humour fails to leave a sizable impression.",

After a threat from the tiger shere khan forced mim to flee the jungle a man-cub named Mowgli embarks on a journey of self discovery with the panther Bagheera and free spirit bear, Babo.\nI have a whole list of reasons the movie was good. Instead of listing them all to you ill give you the top three. The Jungle Book  has extremely good visuals (animation). Another thing i like about the movie is all the different species were all in a \"peace treaty\" due to depleted water source. They even had the bear necessities song . Some downfalls to the movie are that none of the humans could speak and act like wild animals which was kinda disgraceful. Also the lion cub mowgli  is only halfway clothed.\nAll considered i would rate this movie ? so if you see it invite some friends and family to enjoy it too.",

And the songs, although classics no doubt, are just forced and corny here. As weird as it would be to see a Jungle Book remake without \"The Bare Necessities\" ....it might have been for the best. I think it's definitely worth a watch, but the overly simple plot left me wanting more. I'm kinda interested in seeing the Andy Serkis/Warner Bros. version in a few years as a comparison, hopefully it'll be a little darker.",

When an evil and intimidating tiger named Shere Khan (Idris Elba) makes him to leave his home and flee the jungle, it forces him to stand up and fend for himself.  Now I have had mixed feeling about this live action remake trend with Disney.  I don't know if they are pushing these out just so they don't lose the rights to these properties, but they have been executed with varying degrees of quality.  So far, we've gotten Maleficent and the somewhat lacking Cinderella.  You better get used to it, because they have eight live action fairy tale movies slated to come out in the next three years.  If they are all as good as The Jungle Book, we've got nothing to worry about, because they've put together a piece with craft and care for days with this film.  What really makes this so special is just how outstanding the special effects look.  They're ridiculously well done, and it is so flawless that I'm pretty confident that this is the best talking animals have looked in any live action movie of all time, and I say that without hyperbole.  It makes perfect sense that this is directed by Jon Favreau, as he has had a lot of experience directing special effect extravaganzas in the Marvel Universe, and he really nails it here.  These animals have a lot of life, heart, and they really help to move the story forward with a lot of emotion.  You hate Shere Khan because he is so intimidating and mean (typical cat), and you love Baloo because he is so light and lovable, and he is voiced perfectly by Bill Murray, so much so he ends up being the standout part of the movie.  All of the voice actors are great for their parts... with one exception, for me at least.  I think Christopher Walken is miscast as King Louie.  I dug what they did with the character, making this larger than life orangutan that almost comes off as a mobster, but I don't like his voice for the part, and much like he already proved with Peter Pan Live, singing isn't in his repertoire.  This is a fast moving adventure for the whole family, although it does get scary and intense in parts.  I only saw the animated version a few times, but I ran the live action 1994 movie into the ground growing up (still need to go back and see if it holds up).  There are constantly talking animals which make the movie, although it makes it a bit odd whenever there is an animal that can't talk (they address it briefly, but don't really give you a concrete reason behind it all).  Neel Sethi is good as Mowgli, and I am sure he has a bright future ahead of him.  The Jungle Book completes its job quite well, and its job is to fill you with a sense of wonder.",

Directed by Jon Favreau, the entire film was shot indoors on sound-stages with blue screens, motion capture performances, and state-of-the-art technology that truly immerses the viewer into a completely fake jungle; they never once shot on-location! The story follows closer to the original Rudyard Kipling novel than a strict adaptation of the animated classic, most notably with the lack of a musical approach and thus leans heavily on the dramatic story which is quite powerful here. The film stars only one human character, Mowgli, played by newcomer Neel Sethi, who rose to the occasion and carried this movie insanely well, having to interact with a completely faux reality must've been tough. Luckily, he did have help from an amazing voice cast: Bill Murray, Idris Elba, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken, Lupita Nyong'o, and Scarlett Johansson all give impressive performances, Bill Murray perfectly cast as the laid-back Baloo, and Idris Elba commanding the screen as the villainous tiger, Shere Khan! The story plays out basically the same as the original, with a few nice additions such as the animals' fear of the red flower (fire) and Mowgli's family being directly responsible for Shere Khan's rage, but don't expect too many surprises here. The Jungle Book was a pleasant surprise featuring real heart, drama, and humour, and though it's completely unnecessary considering the original is still excellent, it's a perfectly solid substitute to a film that's nearly 50 years old!",

Having never seen The Life of Pi, I am in awe at how far CGI has come, and how director Jon Favreau uses this for a more primitive portrayal of the characters at hand. There may be law in the jungle, but when push comes to shove, we see the characters fight and move like the animals that they are. This is even more effective when they stop speaking English altogether, and instead call out through their native tongue. They even keep the Sherman Brothers songs, which, while standing out as the weakest components of the movie, will certainly delight both young kids and those who have fond memories of the 1967 Disney adaptation.

            "content": "Despite the familiar title this movie is actually a blend of the classic 1967 Jungle Book movie from Disney, and Rudyard Kipling's  collective works based around the adventures of Mowgli. So basically you're getting bits that you will probably recognise taken straight outta the Disney classic, and bits that have been taken from the original stories that were left out of the Disney classic. Although I will say right now that I have not seen the Disney movie since I was a kid and I have never read any of the Kipling stories sooo...I know almost zippo here. Yet...I believe most of this is generally coming from the Disney version, more so than the original stories, seemed that way.\n\nThe plot is very simple with this tale, simple and dumb. A baby Mowgli is left for dead in the Indian jungle after his father is killed by the ferocious tiger Shere Khan. Luckily Mowgli is found by a black panther named Bagheera and taken to a pack of Indian wolves to be looked after. The wolf Raksha raises Mowgli as one of her own in the depths of the jungle, Mowgli becomes a man cub. Everything is fine and dandy until one day Shere Khan decides he wants to eat Mowgli, so the wolves (and other animal friends) decide it would be best to send Mowgli back to his own people. So yeah you gotta take all this with a huge pinch of cosmic salt naturally. Firstly, the animals all have names because of course they do, secondly, they obviously talk...but some don't?? don't question it. Thirdly, the plot makes no fecking sense at all, why didn't Bagheera take Mowgli straight back to the human camp (or any humans) when he first found him? What possible good could come from giving him to a pack of wolves to be raised?? Clearly he would never fit in because he's a bloody human being, hello? Lastly, why on earth does it take many years before Shere Khan decides he wants to kill Mowgli? Did he not notice the human child being raised by the wolves? I mean, they all live in the same vicinity do they not. Yes OK its a children's fantasy, but still, no sense whatsoever (and that goes for the Disney version also).\n\nAnyway this being a modern movie the main hook will of course be the visual effects, the visual CGI effects and how mesmerising they can be, but are they? Well they are and they aren't really, on one hand the backdrops and locations are gorgeous to look at, even of they are all fake. But if there's one thing CGI can do well its landscapes in the background and oh my this doesn't disappoint. What's even more impressive is some (or all) of these backdrops and landscapes are actually based on real locations in India (so I've read), so even though its CGI magic, its based on real mother Earth. That being said it still can't escape the dreaded greenscreen monster which always rears its ugly head against the live action Mowgli. I'm afraid I have the same complaints with the CGI creatures too. On one hand some of the animals look truly amazing, incredibly authentic...such as the elephants, Bagheera, the wolves, Shere Khan and various smaller mammals. On the other hand some animals look obviously CGI and in some cases hokey...such as Baloo the bear, the monkeys, King Louie, Kaa the snake etc...Another issue I had was the implementation of the actors features into some of the animal characters. This mainly stands out with both Baloo/Bill Murray and King Louis/Christopher Walken. Why the flip would you want either animal to have similar facial features to the voice actor?? It makes Baloo look ridiculous and King Louie look positively scary with his glaring sky blue eyes. Speaking of King Louis, my God! since when is King Kong in this story?! Jesus Christ they really fudged up on that. Changing Louis from an Orangutan to a Gigantopithecus might be more accurate for the creatures native habitat but it will scare the shit outta the kids! Plus the whole size thing is ludicrous.\n\nSegue of sorts onto the voice work here, nope! just no!! Now don't get me wrong, most of the animal voices were fine here, mainly because I wasn't really sure who was providing the voices, and that's exactly what you want, what you need!! The casting of Bill Murray, Edris Elba and Christopher Walken was terrible! absolutely terrible! Bill Murray is literally just doing his usual Bill Murray-ish, deadpan, sarcastic ramblings which might work most of the time, but lets be clear, doesn't work all of the time and in no way fit this character. Walken was clearly given the role to give King Louie a comical, light-hearted, crime kingpin-esque twist on the character which again isn't really right (plus he's too scary for the kids). And lastly Elba voices Shere Khan...so a Bengal tiger with a cockney accent, riiight. I'm sorry but these recognisable voices just didn't fit the bill for me and threw me right out of the picture every time. Naturally the two Disney songs forced in didn't help in any way either, holy schnitzel Walken's singing was atrocious. Without the background chorus from the other monkeys (in the Disney classic) the song just sounds bad, plain bad, all the oo oo oo's and so forth really sound stupid without backup vocals. But needless to say there was really no need for the songs at all, the movie is going for a more sensible approach based on the original stories, the songs were a Disney thing, the two don't really blend here. This ultimately just felt like a cheap nostalgia hook.\n\nI also found myself questioning many many stupid points and some plot holes along the way. It is mentioned that elephants are treated almost like Gods of the jungle, that they created the jungle by creating rivers with their tusks etc...wut?? How are they so God-like exactly? oh and why do elephants apparently not speak? Come to think of it birds don't speak either. Near the start Mowgli is trying to escape from Khan, he finds himself jumping into a muddy trench which suddenly gets clobbered by a stampede of buffalo...yet he survives this by managing to grab onto a passing buffalo horn and riding to safety. Remember, this Mowgli is live action, not a cartoon. Towards the finale Shere Khan is able to beat all the wolves and Bagheera at the same time which in itself is pretty impressive, yet none of the other animals help, not even the rhinos who could surely beat Khan. As Mowgli races back from the human camp with a lit torch he accidentally manages to start a [b]HUGE[/b] jungle fire that spreads real fast, from a single ember? At the same time as this Mowgli also manages to run all the way back to the area he grew up in (with the wolves), from the human camp which I thought was a long distance away?? I mean, the whole movies runtime is spent following Mowgli progress further and further away from his home (with the wolves), because he's supposed to be going back to the humans (supposedly some distance from where the animals dwell deep in the jungle). But then right at the end he's able to run all the way back in an instant. Oh and I might mention that both Baloo and Bagheera see where Mowgli is headed at this point in time, but are unable to catch him...and they're animals. One final point which kinda sums up the cheapness of the plot here, Baloo is seemingly bitten badly by Khan in the final fight. I say seemingly because nothing happens with it, it happens, we see it, and there are no consequences. Next scene he's all good and we're moving on. Surprising actually as I was expecting a really gooey emotional moment with that.\n\nSo in the end what does this offer over the Disney classic? Well not much frankly, visuals aside not very much at all and that's because this movie is essentially all about the visuals. They have used all sorts of new special effects jiggery-pokery for creating realistic animal animations (courtesy of Weta) which admittedly do look slick and sexy for the most part, and as said backgrounds and landscapes do also look fantastic. There are times when this does look more like an educational documentary, and I have since learned more about the jungles of India, but overall I simply can't help but think that's all this is. A glossy effects flick showcasing how good glossy effects can look with the right amount of dosh thrown at them. There was really no need to make a live action version of this tale, for me personally, it just doesn't look right, probably never will, and will always look better animated. In all honesty I can see myself saying the same thing about other future obligatory live action remakes ('The Lion King'). But yet again I find myself asking how this movie did so well, have movie standards really dropped so low? do people just accept anything average now? Sure this is a fair ride but its nothing special, in no way. A bland, simple remake with shiny effects, generally bog standard A-list voice work, glaring plot holes and touch and go with whether or not its too scary for the kids, hmmm.",

I even liked the Bear Necessities song.  The only thing I disliked about this movie was Christopher Walken's King Louie.  He was just way, way too recognizable.  He took me out of the film not only with his recognizable voice, but his stupid and unnecessary song number.  Also, was it really necessary to have Mowgli play with a cowbell right before Christopher Walken starts talking???  Again:  Pulls you out of the movie.",

It proves that it's impossible to duplicate Walt Disney's vision and amazing storytelling methods, which has touched people around the world of all ages. The mixture of true life and CGI worked extremely well in this film but it's not upbeat like the original, which is also known for it's brilliant music, and I found it hard to connect to the various characters. Neel Sethi (Mowgli), played his role extremely well, and I have to give him recognition because it must have been hard to interact with characters that aren't really there but the songs popped up in weird places and it lacked the fun aspect, that we all loved from the original. Its still a joy to watch, and I'm sure that the kids will love it but I've got a feeling that people will still be going back to the original film. I have to commend the director, for taking on such a massive task but I personally think that he should have worked more on the storyline than the visual experience. On the plus side, the actors who were chosen for the voices, we're spot on and Bill Murray (Baloo), added some, much needed, humour to the movie. I just think that it's time for some new storylines, and that people should stop trying to bring back the magic from the old time classics. Watchable!\r\n\r\nRound-Up: \r\nWith such a big task, I'm not surprised that this movie cost so much to make, and judging by the box office takings, Walt Disney's original concepts, are still pulling in audiences around the world. Jon Favreau, 49, took on the huge task of portraying Mowgli's amazing journey in the wild, and with another Jungle Book movie in the pipeline, he certainly impressed the big wigs in Hollywood. With movies like Elf, Zathura, Iron Man 1 & 2, the awful Cowboys & Aliens and Chef under his belt, along with a successful acting career, his enthusiasm for film is what has pushed him to new heights, especially with the success of the Iron Man movies. He certainly achieved a new type of movie making with this movie but the original was much better, in my eyes.\r\n\r\nBudget: $175million\r\nWorldwide Gross: $964million\r\n\r\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their family/adventure/dramas, starring Neel Sethi, and with the voices by, Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Christopher Walken, Scarlett Johansson, Lupita Nyong'o, Giancarlo Esposito, Garry Shandling and Jon Favreau. 6/10",

The Jungle Book not only impresses but it surpasses all its CGI brethren of films. From the look of the jungle to the facial animations of the animals, it's mesmerizing to say the least. The breathtaking visuals add a visceral look to it's all non-threatening cartoon animation counterparts with their loud vicious roars, low growls, and threatening animalistic sounds. The sound is truly spectacular immersing you in the depths of the jungle making you feel every step in the mud hearing rain create percussion sounds as it lands on the bed rock. What brings these animals to life is their amazing voice actors giving A+ performances. This film may not bring much to the forefront of story telling but it's visuals will you talking and pleasantly satisfied for months to come until the next Disney live action film arrives.

            "content": "If you are looking for one of those films that demonstrates new techniques in visual imagery, than Disney's \"Jungle Book\" remake is for you. It is on that same list that sets \"Avatar\" and \"Gravity\" from the dozens of other films using (or mis-using) CGI. And visually, \"Jungle Book\" impresses. However, if you're looking for any kind of magic regarding story and script surprises, you will be less successful. Watching this gave me strong vibes of Disney's \"Dinosaur\" back in 2000, which boasted (at the time) revolutionary animation, but was sorely lacking on all other fronts. \n\nLet's start off by analyzing the favorable:  the animation will flabbergast you. The creatures are so lifelike, I was under the impression that artists had superimposed CG lips and eyes over real animal footage. By comparison, they make the animals in \"Narnia\" look like utter garbage. But the truly awe-inspiring feat pulled off by \"Jungle Book\" was not in the wolves, bears, and large wild cats; no, the real stunner was the fully-photorealistic and completely believable environments these animals lived in. Trees, foliage undergrowth, rocks, streams, hilltops, and temples, every background looked like something pulled out of a Discovery Channel show. All of it looked believable.\n \nWith that said, I do wonder why Disney decided to go to obscene lengths to animate all backgrounds, as the finished film did not utilize the technology to its fullest. For the most part, \"Jungle Book\" played like a live action film with not as many carefully-planned camera swoops and pans as I would have expected. The Kaa sequence, as an example, was a waste of potential; while the Walt Disney classic had the snake demonstrate its awesome length by coiling, turning, grabbing Mowgli and playing with its food, this Kaa was so static and unmoving it might as well have been accomplished through matte painting. The entire thing may have felt \"grounded\" in part because of the way filmmakers chose to bring Mowgli to life... \n\n... And this leads me into the first major complaint I had with this film. Mowgli. I will give young Neel Sethi a break because he's a kid and I won't dwell on the fact that he was no Haley Joel Osment, but I will criticize filmmakers for not truly pushing the boundaries in animation by attempting to pull off a fully-lifelike CG character. In short: they cut corners. They didn't even try to go the extra mile in the one area of CG that needs the most innovation. Boo to Jon Favreau and team for being so paranoid of the \"uncanny valley\" they didn't even attempt to innovate. If they had just tried, I would have given them a full star more in my rating. I will give them credit for seamlessly blending in Neel Sethi into every background, but I do think using a live actor greatly limited the scope and vision of the overall film. \n\nNow, for the deluge of criticism...\nThe story was a complete mess. The script was an even greater mess. I have criticized Walt Disney's 1967 animated film for its lack of narrative direction, as the story seemed to be a series of unrelated antics tying one scene to the next, story obstacles to prevent Mowgli from reaching the man village. Here, the events are even more random and convoluted. Kaa appears and then she exits the story forever. King Louie appears and then he exits the story forever. The elephant herd appears and then leaves the story forever (without saying a word, too!) At least the animated classic integrated these characters and had them return. For example, the animated film had several scenes with Kaa, and a very memorable and tense encounter between Shere Khan and Kaa. Not here. In the animated film, there were important interactions between Bagheera and the elephant pack. Not here. I would have forgiven these antics if they could have at least ended the story. In this version, nothing gets resolved, as far as Mowgli learning to be a man. (I assume he will be enslaved to con-bear Baloo in honey-capers for the rest of his life? What a waste of human potential.) Mowgli does not even reach man village, which defies the entire point of the plot! Wasn't the symbolic image of Mowgli wielding and controlling the \"red flower\" supposed to denote that he alone possessed powers and ingenuity no animal could possess? The whole film ended flatter than a popped tire. I left feeling as unsatisfied as watching part one of a two-part cliffhanger (ahem, \"Deathly Hallows: Part I.\") \n\nThere were so many things that I disliked about the story. The Kaa scene especially was   annoying. First off, I was puzzled why Disney did a gender swap; I hope it was not because Disney realized there was only one female character in the film, and (like always) they need to have at least one evil female in movies nowadays. But even worse than gender-swapping was how Kaa hypnotized Mowgli; apparently someone in the story department thought it would be intelligent to shoe-horn a flashback sequence here-and-now, completely with mysterious Scarlett Johansson narration to remind us of Galadrial in \"Lord of the Rings.\" Honestly, did we need to see Mowgli's past? And even if we did, couldn't somebody pick a better moment for the flashback? Another horrible aspect was the way Shere Khan was handled. I got the impression that instead of being frightened by fire, he was drawn to it, because he willingly and stupidly climbed a dead tree in the middle of a forest fire without having the foresight that a dead tree might snap. For that matter, how did Mowgli get off that same tree during the same forest fire? How was Mowgli able to run with the torch of fire all the way from the man village to the wolf den, unless the forest was only 50 feet long? And top top it off, I wish everyone would quit referring to fire as \"red flower.\" I'm pretty sure that in Kipling's original, \"red flower\" referred to the physical attributes of a campfire, not a raging forest fire. If I was Shere Kahn witnessing half the forest burn down, I would not exclaim: \"Look at that red flower!\" Instead, my reaction would be more primal: \"Ahhh!!! Red hot terror!!!!!!!!!!!\" A  red flower? No. Just no. \n\nWhen it all boils down, the only sequence I truly enjoyed was King Louie. It was funny, it was scary, it had an awesome remix of the classic \"I Wanna Be Like You.\" Here, filmmakers used CG to its fullest potential, in this case turning King Louie into a 15-foot-tall ape of incredible strength,(the song cleverly incorporates new lyrics saying that he is, in fact, a gigantopithicus. Bonus points for that.) I also sense a dark humor in screenwriters when the monkey temple crushed King Louie, rendering the last remaining gigantopithicus extinct. A nice touch. The entire sequence was loaded with a level of fun and innovation the entire movie should have had, but did not. What should have been laughs throughout was constipated dialogue.\n\nIn the end, while I dig the animation, this new \"Jungle Book\" was too butt-kissy to the Walt Disney classic to stand on its own two feet. And yet, it was not dark and realistic enough to be a faithful adaption of the Rudyard Kipling original. It resides in no man's land. Honestly, Rotten Tomatoes, 95% fresh?",

Well I just watched The Jungle Book, and I found all three of those compliments to be patently untrue. That might sound like three issues, but in reality they all boil down to the same one thing, suspension of disbelief. Or more accurately, the lack of it. From the word go, there wasn't s moment that I found myself being continuously drawn out of the story because of one of those reasons (usually the look of the creatures). I was not once able to fully engage, and though I recognise that from a plot point of view, this version was even better than the 1967 one, I still found myself constantly aggravated by the harsh meshing of Mowgli against the world around him.",

The Disney done it again bring all the classics to a new life, but it is a great team work, especially the post-production was terrific.\n\nIt is one of those stories never gets boring for repeat reading/listening/viewing. Of course, there were plenty of changes to the original source, but I would say it was upgraded so well. Jon Favreau did an awesome job as the director, definitely it is his one of the best films and will be remembered for very long. All the above he got the best screenplay with supportive production and crew.\n\nNeel Sethi was obviously a perfect choice for the man-cub, he had given his best and no one could doubt it was his first film. The entire film was shot in the studio settings and the whole time he had to act alone, because the remaining characters in the film are CGI. So in that viewpoint he actually did a breathtaking job being a very young.\n\nThe CGI characters were really excellent, but the non-fur animals like elephant looked a bit fake. I mean anatomically and character performances were perfect, only visually the 3D models were out of the blend in the screen with others. These are very small things to notice, but for the todays technology, it was not bad, especially thinking the film is primarily targeted children.\n\nThe story was simple, like half of the film was an introduction and almost all the important characters from the book were launched at a high profile. It was actually the story with a backdrop of red flower. So the narration moves different part of the jungle, lot like the levels in a game. Various adventures take place and well composed stunt sequences.\n\nI mentioned stunts right, but there were no violences, I mean nothing seriously to concern about as expected for a Disney film. Yet because of those actions, the film is very much suitable for adult viewing. So apart from the children and families, it can be watched by anyone. One of the top Disney films to do best at the box office worldwide by grabbing almost $1b.\n\nSo aggressive, furious Shere Khan ever to portray. I think the little children may get scared for his unpleasant face look and the strong roar. By the way all the songs were amazing and the end credit was very interesting. Finally, I saw it after a long wait and anticipation, most importantly, I'm very happy how beautifully it was made.\n\nThe film was not shot in India, but the locations were so resembling and gives the perfect Indian feel. Climbing a cliff by Baloo and fighting the monkeys, like that there were numerous jokes. Surely one of the grandly made children's film at the recent time. I've heard the sequel is already on the progress, so bring it on, at least a trilogy before Neel turn to a big boy.\n\n8/10",

            "content": "My reaction towards The Jungle Book reminds me very much of Zootopia, another Disney movie.   The latter film has a near perfect percentage rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  It has only four negative reviews out of 220 tallied on the site.  People praised it as one of Disney's best animated movies ever.  And, when I saw it, honestly, I was a little underwhelmed.  Don't misunderstand me, Zootopia is a hell of a movie.  But it's nowhere near close to Disney's best when it comes to animated movies.  Not even close.  Not saying that this one had the same reception, it's got 95% reviews on RT, but a lot of people were indeed raving about the movie.  And, again, much like Zootopia, I was left a little befuddled by that.  This is nothing more than a good movie with fantastic CGi work.  But, to me, it's nothing more than just a good movie.  I gotta give them props, though, because the movie is darker than one might expect a Disney movie to be, but there was just something missing.  There's many issues I have with the film.  But, to me, the most important one of all is the fact that Neel Sethi, the kid who plays Mowgli, isn't a very good actor.  That's just the truth of the matter.  It wouldn't have been much of a problem if Neel had been cast as a secondary character, but Mowgli is the central character of the story and one of the very few humans in the actual film.  So the fact that they chose him is mind-boggling when I'm sure a ton of other kids auditioned.  If he was the best of them all, then I really don't wanna see the worst of the bunch.  There's literally nothing behind his eyes.  He's just a kid, reciting lines.  He doesn't embody the character whatsoever, he doesn't add life or personality to the character.  There's some scenes where he's fine, but there's some scenes where he's just terrible.  For example, the climactic scene of the film when the wolf pack, Baloo, Bagheera and Mowgli finally decided to fight back against Shere Khan and everyone else rushes Shere Khan.  Mowgli, before rushing at Shere Khan, does this battle yell to, somehow, try to appear intimidating and it was just absolutely awful.  And it wasn't meant to be comedic or anything like that, this is the climax of the film while there's a giant wildfire going on in the background.  So talk about embarrassing.  This is supposed to be the moment when Mowgli stops trying to run away and face his fears head on and that yell was just awful.  I'm surprised they actually let it even make the final cut.  I would have just cut it out, no questions asked.  Neel's delivery on some lines is just so wooden and bad.  It's seriously surprising how this kid actually got the role.  And I realize I seem to be bagging on him too much, but he's the lead and the story is completely centered around him.  So he's the one that I'm gonna focus on the most out of anybody, as he's the only human in the film.  So, yea, this kid was awful.  Secondly, the narrative of the film absolutely did not engage me in any way whatsoever.  Like none, you're just sort of thrown in this universe with minimal introduction and you're somehow supposed to be invested in it?  Eh, doesn't work like that.  There's no real attempt at world building outside of the introduction and some little bits and pieces.  And then to top that off, you have the 'emotional' connection between Mowgli, Baloo and Bagheera.  And I put that in quotations because there was no actual connection between them, just the film telling you that they were close.  Yet again, there's no actual development between these three characters, they don't really build those relationships well at all.  The movie just tells you that these three are super close and that Baloo and Bagheera are willing to sacrifice their lives to help this kid, but you just never see it.  Again, the movie just tells you and expects you to believe them.  And, apparently, a lot of people bought it.  I think this all comes back to the casting of Neel as Mowgli.  It really does.  Every other character in the film is CG animated, so it all comes down on Mowgli to sell that connection he felt to the wolf pack that he'd want to go back to face Shere Khan and to Baloo and Bagheera.  I seem to really be ragging on this movie, huh?  There's two musical numbers in the film and both of them are horrifyingly out of place.  Bare Necessities is in there, I'm assuming, at the behest of Disney.  Maybe I'm wrong, but it just feels like one of their moves.  The other musical number, featuring King Louie, is far more elaborate and even more out of place than the Bare Necessities one.  Like what was the actual point of it all.  Why were there two musical numbers randomly placed in the movie?  Particularly when, as I mentioned, the tone of the film is far more serious and darker than the original film.  I can kinda see justifying having Bare Necessities in there, but the King Louie one is just unacceptable on all levels.  This one is far more nitpicky, but I still felt that it hurt the movie.  They even replay King Louie's song over the credits and it would've made more sense for it to have been placed there as opposed to in the actual movie, where its placement is unjustifiable.  I think that's about it as far as the negatives.  The positives are, as mentioned, the CGi is just outstanding.  Like, literally, it's some of the best I've ever seen, in terms of realism, even down to small movements, and just the amount of detail put into them.  It is something to behold to say the least.  The voice acting is top-notch, all around, everyone is great.  And they would have to be seeing how bad Neel Sethi was.  The movie is also, surprisingly, action-packed.  There's a lot of set-piece moments that are actually really cool and really well done.  So no complaints on that front.  You know, as a whole, in spite of the flaws taking up, like 70% of the review (maybe even more), I'd still say that this is, by and large, a pretty solid movie.  Is it better than the original Jungle Book?  Probably, I haven't seen the animated version in ages.  But this movie is still rampant with flaws that can't be overlooked.  This is a solid rental, at best.  It's just got too many negatives to be anything more than that.",

The story is pretty much parallel to the classic original film, but this new version has it's own twists that make it seem fresh. The 2016 \"The Jungle Book\" is a lot more serious and dramatic than the 60's version, which was more cartoonish and more for young kids. I don't now if this remake is better than the original, just because the 1967 movie is a Disney classic, one of the most iconic Disney movies of al time, but it certainly does the original justice, and stands its ground against the classic. \"The Jungle Book\" is probably the closest I've come to giving a movie 5 stars, but is still an unbelievable movie.",

Infact they look and move better than I've seen, quite possibly ever, in terms of CGI. The story and dialogue is pretty standard stuff bar a few funny bits. Scarlett Johansson had a paltry role in the film, so much so they unfortunately let her 'sing' a bit in the credits. The other voices were bang on, Bill Murray, Idris Elba and Ben Kingsley were great as their respective animals. Neel Sethi as the jungle mancub, Mowgli, did an ok job but his voice was unfortunately slightly irksome when he said more than a few sentences. Naive doesn't have to be wine-y.

            "content": "(2.5 stars)\nThis has the bare necessities to adequately retell the Jungle Book story but the wit and charm of the animated classic are certainly missing. While the CGI quality is generally solid and it boasts couple entertaining scenes, this modern adaptation has a fair amount of elements which just don't fit. \n\nFirst you have the voice acting. Actors appeared to be largely picked on their current celebrity status instead of suitability, a common occurrence in today's animations. The supposedly terrifying tiger, Shere Khan, is hard to take seriously when he has the Londoner accent of Idris Elba. I'm surprised he did not threaten Mowgli by saying \"You want some, you want some do ya?\". Admittedly he grows into the role but the casting definitely could have been better. Christopher Walken as King Louis gives the impression that he wasn't going to tolerate any monkey business since he plays the orangutan like a mafia boss. This is fine and actually worked in conveying greater intimidation up until he breaks into the famous \"I wanna be like you\" song. It just did not compliment the atmosphere that had been created while Walken's old fragile voice struggled to hit some of the higher notes. This leads onto another point that this and the 'bear necessities' song were shoe-horned in. I thought the style of this movie lends itself to a music-free narrative, however they felt obliged to honour the popular soundtrack of the Disney original. Understandable but not a successful choice in my opinion. Lastly, we have Mowgli's interaction with the animals. The actor looked the part but, and I feel harsh criticising a child, he could have prospered from more direction. It became too obvious sometimes that the animals were not there and he was interacting with a green screen. I'm not saying it is easy but it made it difficult to become fully immersed from an audience point of view.\n\nMaybe a cruel evaluation of a movie which probably satisfies the intended role of good family entertainment. The story still holds up and the action scenes with Shere Khan and King Louis are impressive. In my book, modern adaptations or remakes will always suffer from comparisons to the original and on this occasion it is clear the 1967 animation continues to be King of the Jungle (Book).",

            "content": "The Jungle Book transports you into a beautiful world filled with incredible set-pieces. If director Jon Favreau's intent was to have each location create a shift in mood, he wildly succeeds. The rocky stomping grounds of the wolfpack creates an air of lightheartedness. Once Mowgli sets foot on the watering hole or trudges through the open plains of high-grass, you instantly get a feeling of uneasiness, like something bad is about to happen. Go further into the jungle depths and it will make your skin crawl as you await the dangers that are seemingly lurking around every corner. All of these set-pieces are not only distinct, but succeed independently of animal interaction. I was nervous for young Mowgli's safety inside the Monkey Temple long before King Louie showed up.\n\nThe characters make up the other half of the movie's successful equation. Each animal, originally done in their own right, dominate their respective scenes while advancing the story. Even the smallest parts, like the giant squirrel played by Sam Raimi, are completely unique and help flesh out the jungle world. My favorite character, Ikki the porcupine (played by Garry Shandling) had a minute role but made me smile the entire time he was on screen.\n\nMowgli the \"man-cub\" has been raised in the wild by a family of wolves. While the wild is all he has ever known, his parents know that eventually he is going to have to insert himself into human life. Bagheera the panther, Mowgli's mentor, decides now is as good a time as ever to take Mowgli to human society as the man-cub suddenly finds himself being hunted by Shere Kan the vicious tiger. While the film is plenty enjoyable, it definitely isn't without its faults.\n\nDisney's movies, Pixar in particular, are particularly good at stirring up emotion within the audience but there were moments in The Jungle Book that missed the mark for me. There is one particular pivotal moment in the film that occurs that should have been a very moving moment, but it happens...and nothing. I'm not sure if emotional conveyance is the proper terminology, but if it is, this film could have used more of it.\n\nI was also a bit thrown off by the motive of the antagonist Shere Khan. Shere Khan wants Mowgli gone from the jungle because he is a man-cub and men only bring danger and destruction to the life around them. I get that part. What I didn't understand, however (spoiler alert?), is why Shere Khan continued to be so persistent after Mowgli tried to leave the wild. Why not, I don't know, just let it go? Most animals, when threatened, move on once the threat has seemingly been eliminated. While I did appreciate Khan's bad-assness, I wasn't quite sold on his necessity of pursuit.\n\nFinally, I want to take a moment to bring up Neel Sethi's performance as Mowgli. Though nothing stellar by any means, I thought it was a decent performance. I actually liken his performance to that of Jake Lloyd when he played young Anakin in Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace. I find it a bit funny that, while Sethi's performance was lauded, critics came down extremely hard on Lloyd's acting. At the end of the day, they're kids and they shouldn't be expected to have the same chops as Sean Connery or Liam Neeson. Lloyd wasn't the problem in The Phantom Menace just as Sethi's ok performance in The Jungle Book doesn't make the movie any less enjoyable. \n\nThe Jungle Book is a good family movie that's just as much beautiful as it is fun. I give it an 80.",

            "content": "It's hard to believe that it was 49 years ago when Disney released an animated interpretation of Rudyard Kipling's collection of stories known as The Jungle Book. I was a young tyke at the time and I loved the film so much that my parents must have regretted buying me the soundtrack album afterwards. I'm sure they grew very tired of hearing \"The Bare Necessities\" and the other memorable songs on the LP being played over and over again. (How was I supposed to know, or care, about the whole backroom drama surrounding \"I Wan'na Be Like You\"?*)\n\nAs I was watching the film again the other night, I was struck by how simple it was. The story plays out like eight or so (I wasn't counting) Flintstones-like episodes about the panther, Bagheera (voiced by Sebastian Cabot), and his attempts to get young Mowgli to leave the jungle and return to the man-village. The film's mood was very light and references to pop culture at the time were woven throughout the storyline. Both Baloo and King Louie were obvious lovers of Dixieland/New Orleans jazz, which is not surprising given who voiced these characters (Phil Harris and Louis Prima, respectively). As the sun set on the jungle and Mowgli went off with his new love, we were assured that everyone would live happily ever after. Although the 1967 version of THE JUNGLE BOOK doesn't rank as one of Disney's best efforts, it does hold up to time although perhaps more so for very young viewers. Today's nine-year-olds might find the animation laughingly primitive or the story too simplistic.\n\nThe 2016 version of THE JUNGLE BOOK is a whole different affair. Although director Jon Favreau (CHEF) used the 1967 film as his inspiration, he created a Disney film for today's audiences. Mowgli and the gang are all back, though this man-cub is played by real-life, 12-year-old actor Neel Sethi starring in his feature-film debut. Both the animals and the jungle were created on computer screens in downtown Los Angeles, we're told in the closing credits, and they are so lifelike it's often hard to believe that they're not the real thing. This interpretation of Kipling's short stories is slightly different too. There are no Beatle-esque vultures here, and the elephants play a less prominent role. Shere Khan (voiced by Idris Elba) has a larger role and is much more menacing than his 1967 counterpart. As a result, the film has a darker tone than its predecessor and may not be ideal viewing for very young children. Favreau's TJB is also more violent - one animal dies and the jungle catches fire due to carelessness (no doubt an environmental message coming from drought-stricken California where forest fires are now becoming a regular occurrence). But, as an homage to the 1967 film, Favreau included three of its classic songs, two of which are sung during the film and the other during the closing credits. Unfortunately, while this was a noble - even romantic - gesture, it doesn't work and the two songs seem jarringly out of place. Favreau, or perhaps even Disney's execs, may have thought the story was getting too dark and they wanted to lighten up the mood with some bouncy tunes but they were completely unnecessary. Today's audiences are sadly used to darkness and violence.\n\nSurprisingly, or perhaps Favreau was keeping close to the 1967 screenplay, King Louie appears in this film too. (The simian was never a character in Kipling's original works.) However, rather than being an orangutan again, a species that is not native to India, Favreau's King Louie (voiced by Christopher Walken) is a Gigantopithecus, an extinct species of great ape. Favreau and Walken also draw upon contemporary pop culture by having Louie sound like Marlon Brando's Col. Kurtz from the film, APOCALYPSE NOW! I doubt young viewers would see the connection but anyone who is old enough to remember the original film will get it.\n\nSethi's performance is nothing short of golden, and not just because he's the only human in the film. He had to learn parkour so that it would appear that he could bound over rocks and swing from vines with the greatest of ease. Ben Kingsley (the voice of Bagheera) lends the perfect amount of gravitas to the role, and Bill Murray (the voice of Baloo) is ideal as the carefree bear. In a break from the 1967 film which had an all-male but one cast, Favreau cast Scarlett Johansson as the voice of the s-s-s-s-seductive python, Ka. She, too, makes the most of her all-too-brief encounter with Mowgli. Christopher Walken is the weak link among the voice actors in the film. Once we see King Louie in all his hirsute glory, Walken's characterisation of him changes from army man-gone-native to New Jersey mobster. Perhaps if he could carry a tune, his rendition of \"I Wan'na Be Like You\" wouldn't have been so annoying.\n\nEven with its missteps though, the 2016 THE JUNGLE BOOK is still a winner and will be remembered as a Disney classic. Go see it on the big screen and be sure to sit through all the credits. (Keep your ears out for the late Garry Shandling who provided the voice for Ikki the porcupine.)\n\n* King Louie was a character created for the 1967 film, and was written with jazz legend Louis Armstrong in mind to be the character's voice. Walt Disney, however, was worried that King Louie would be seen as a racist depiction of black people, a concern made even more apparent when Armstrong would have to sing the line, \"An ape like me can learn to be human too\". Armstrong was ditched and jazz musician Louis Prima was brought on board to voice the character.",

            "content": "The 1967 animated film to me is still one of Disney's best of the \"classic era\". This is not just nostalgia talking, quite a few childhood favourites have not held up, but 'The Jungle Book' is an example of one that has.\n\nExpectations were mixed for seeing this film. The trailer looked great, the voice cast is filled with enormous talent and the featurette was fascinating. It was just that, relating it to the other Disney live action adaptations, whether it was going to be one example of a re-boot that looked stunning, was well-written and performed, respected its original source material(s) and added its fresh spin, like 'Cinderella, or a well-made film with enough other decent elements to make it watchable but also one lacking in soul and charm, like 'Alice in Wonderland'.\n\nFortunately, 'The Jungle Book' is an even stronger example of the former, and is one of Jon Favreau's best films along with 'Iron Man'. Fans of the animation will love recognising the familiar characters and scenes and it was also really nice to see more of Rudyard Kipling's writing and story telling here, the ending being closer to that of the animated film. 'The Jungle Book' is wonderful on its own merits too, just like the Disney animated film was, which was a poor adaptation of the book but worked so well as a film on its own that it didn't matter.\n\nCriticisms for the film are very few. The first criticism is that Kaa's scene and screen-time is far too short, a great character like Kaa deserves far more than a mere five minutes or so. And it is a shame because it is a very suspenseful and hypnotic scene with some of the film's most striking visuals, and the deceptively maternal story teller approach was beautifully written and delivered. Regrettably, the other criticism was \"I Wanna Be Like You\". While one of the highlights of the animated film, and one of Disney's most iconic moments, because the scene is darker and King Louie more intimidating (in size and manner), also because it comes out of nowhere, the light-hearted fun of the song that worked so brilliantly before just doesn't fit here (if Christopher Walken really did desperately want to sing the song, it didn't show in his singing because he sounded uninterested and hesitant).\n\nOn the other hand, the film looks amazing. The rich, expansive cinematography is some of the best of the year so far and the scenery and settings are so vividly detailed and colourful, that reading that it was shot entirely in a warehouse was a shock. The rendering of the animals are staggeringly realistic, especially Shere Khan, Bagheera and the monkeys. Favreau directs with a keen eye for detail and spectacle, yet doesn't forget the drama, cast or the storytelling once. John Debney's music score is full of energy, atmosphere, warm orchestration and vibrant emotion, its referencing of familiar themes feeling nostalgic and affectionate rather than cheap. As for the songs in the film, although \"I Wanna Be Like You\" was a disappointment \"Bear Necessities\" fitted right in and was as good-natured and easy-going as one can hope and \"Trust in Me\" is worth listening to if you stay for the closing credits, Scarlett Johansson with her low-register, smoky yet sensual tone does a surprisingly good job with the song.\n\n'The Jungle Book's' script is very funny (Baloo getting the funniest lines, and some of them were hilarious) without being childish or simplistic while also easy to understand and thought-provoking, there is a good amount of depth too without being too dark or sugary sweet. The story moves quickly and is constantly enthralling, one thing it does better than the animated version is expanding on motivations and making characters more interesting (as great a villain as Shere Khan is in the animated film, his motivation to me seemed clearer here). The climax is dramatically satisfying and darkly tense.\n\nA great job is done with the characters also. They're not complex, but they are likable and interesting, are very true in personality to their animated counterparts and all serve a point in the storytelling, some like Shere Khan and the wolves expanded upon. It was easy to identify with Mowgli, Baloo is a breath of fresh air and to me a great villain is one that one can totally see why the villain is hated or feared but one can also understand their point of view, which is the case with Shere Khan (this is true of the animated film too, but as Shere Khan has more of a back story here it came through stronger to me). The cast were a talented one to begin with and their talents absolutely shine through. Newcomer Neel Sethi does very credibly as Mowgli, it is incredibly hard to react against nothing and apart from a few naturally stiff moments to begin with he handles all the different emotional elements very well. The superbly chosen vocal cast are even better.\n\nBill Murray was born for Baloo (sounding far more engaged than as Garfield), his relaxed but witty voice-work matching the character's easy-going, good-natured personality. Idris Elba effectively puts dread into one's heart as Shere Khan, he's silky, regal, charismatic and genuinely menacing, though George Sanders brought over the suavity and oiliness more. Ben Kingsley is a stern yet sympathetic Bagheera, and Christopher Walken, in a characterisation that is like a mix of mobster boss, Colonel Kurtz and Walken's own mannerisms, makes King Louie intimidating but also entertaining. Scarlett Johansson's voice work for Kaa is eerily sensual, Giancarlo Esposito is a dignified Akeela and Lupita Nyong'o's Raksha is movingly compassionate.\n\nIn conclusion, a truly great film. Works very well as a live-action re-boot and works even more as a film in general. An epic visually stunning adventure, told with fun, heart and depth. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Yes; it might not take a very different path from the original film and its story, and it's sometimes a bit too predictable. Another flaw is that I wanted even more inside to the main character -- not only about everything around him, but more about his inside and personality.

            "content": "If there's any more proof there aren't any new ideas in Hollywood, it's the fact that beloved animated classics are being remade as live-action films. Sometimes this works, but more often than not, the ploy to attract those nostalgic feelings from the audience fails, thus leaving the viewer with the sense that their childhood is ruined. I'm generally pretty hesitant of these types of films, mainly because part of me doesn't want to admit that the original films sometimes weren't that great. That being said, the latest in these adaptations, The Jungle Book (2016) certainly surprised me.\n\nUnlike some films like Maleficent (2014), which takes a different point of view from the main story of Sleeping Beauty (1959), and more like Cinderella (2015), which covers the same material as its predecessor, Cinderella (1950), The Jungle Book takes the main ideas from Rudyard Kipling's book, via the animated interpretation of The Jungle Book (1967) and brings the adaptation to near perfection. While The Jungle Book's classically animated predecessor certainly had its moments, a lot of its appeal fell to obvious popular culture references (like the Beatles as vultures), and a number of catchy and flashy song-and-dance routines. As a result, I can't honestly remember what the plot of the original film was trying to convey. This was why I was quite impressed with director Jon Favreau's adaptation: the plot was direct and made sense, while also highlighting man's ability to create useful (as well as deadly) tools. It was clear how Mowgli (Neel Sethi) needed to adapt to his strengths to survive in the jungle instead of just hanging around with his animal friends. Also, the clear distinction of the connection between him and Shere Khan (Idris Elba) created a much-needed tension to the story.\n\nSome will recall that The Jungle Book has already been made as a live-action film with The Jungle Book (1994). However, advances in computer-generated imagery over the years have made the ability to create talking animals a mind-numbingly realistic endeavor. The voice acting cast for this version was pretty spot on, and the pacing was fantastic. What's more, there still were snippets of songs and subtle pop culture references (my favorite being the cowbell in King Louie's (Christopher Walken) lair), but they didn't distract from the flow of the film.\n\nA superior film to its classically animated predecessor, 5.0 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Jungle Book is a well made remake that succeeds in delivering a slightly different story, capitalizing on state-of-the-art CGI and laudable performances to suit the whole family.\n\nWhen I first watched the trailer, I had real goosebumps when I heard Bare Necessities playing in the background. The nostalgia and euphony of the tune urged me to see the film without a pounding heart. After nearly 5 months I can finally take a close look at this remake. I am a big fan of the 1967 version, which features one of the best sets of songs ever put to the big screen. This 2016 is somehow a much darker, serious film, with more scares and ponderous themes. Throughout most of the screen time, while marveling at the breathtaking scenery and astoundingly realistic CGI (breakthrough performance on the computer's part), I was occasionally bothered by how the plot and scripts deviated from what I expected, and the lack of warmth and humor I enjoyed when rewatching the 1967 musical. The third act is well done, nevertheless, and along with the incredible CGI so as Neel Sethi's extraordinary performance as Mowgli forming the backbone of this remake. Jungle Book is a well made remake that succeeds in delivering a slightly different story, capitalizing on state-of-the-art CGI to suit well for family audience. (Too scary and dark for a kids film, too generic for higher level audiences)\n\nMan, the CGI alone is worth the ticket price (in my case download time). Scenes could have been awkward if the technology had not reach this level, and Mowgli's performance is very worth praising because he expressed and acted naturally even though the characters were not there. \n\nYet, I am somehow less satisfied with the film than I thought I should be. Supposedly comedic scenes were somehow dramatized and were given darker turns, and sometimes they feel hollow and disappointing. Elephants scenes are an example. Not only did the elephants not talk, they didn't attain the sarcastic humor that prevails in the 1967 version. Shere Khan was more violent and evil, thus losing the witty sense of humor, and so did Kaa. Another thing is that the relationship between Mowgli and Baloo was not quite as intimate as the first film. Yes, both characters might not be animated this time, but still a weird decision to have Baloo befriending the man-cub just for honey. Baloo's apparent sacrifice at the end was also omitted. As a result, \"Bare Necessities\" scene was not as memorable as I thought of, and that's cuz their bond was not well developed yet!\n\nI could go on and pick out more stuff that I disliked during viewing, such as how the film ruined \"I Wanna Be Like You\" by having a big ape throwing fruits everywhere while monkeys squeaked at the background. The scene should be like how the end-credits depicted (King Louie dancing around in his palace). However, I won't go into that much criticism because its a good film. The CGI's amazing. I love how they gave the wolves more screentime and significance, since they are barely developed in 1967 version. Vultures are cut off, good. The third act is also something I never thought would happen in Jungle Book, providing a deeper message and a more thrilling climax than the predecessor. At the end of the day I won't say I am fully satisfied, but yet I'll say I am decently entertained by the CGI and the overall tone of the story. Besides, is there anything better than listening to \"Bare Necessities\", \"Trust in Me\" once more with a little modern mix? Priceless.",

I expected better from Favreau since he directed ELF and IRON MAN and already had high hopes for this adaptation but was sorely disappointed. Sparkly CGI was used as an excuse for decent storytelling and depth. The additions to the story were unnecessary ( keep in mind this is adapting the 1967 Jungle Book animated film). The score was average at best but the songs, though whimsical in the original are manhandled here. The 2016 version of THE JUNGLE BOOK is a atrocious mess that fails to capture the magic of Walt Disney's classic film. I'd give THE JUNGLE BOOK a 1/10.",

Walking out of this movie, I Loved it!! Everyone a part of this movie did an excellent job from acting,Cgi, directing, everything. The blend of real and cgi was done so well, all thanks to the fantastic director Jon Favreau. Every film he does, it gets better and better. This is his best film yet. Now Neel Sethi, this was his first ever movie and for that I thought he did a great job. There were scenes I didn't think  he would be able to do but I was totally wrong. Everyone did great, especially Idris Elba as the villain. Bill Murray is fantastic as always. Personally the person who blew me away was Christopher Walken. He was just amazing. Overall The jungle book is another fantastic movie by Disney and Jon Favreau is only getting better as a director. Definitely needs to be seen in a theater and I do recommend seeing it in 3D.

The movie is visually stunning and some of the shots done as Mowgli traverses the forest are spectacular. The story changes used from the original I did not particularly care for or agree with. I thought Kingsley was a perfect Bagheera, but did not think that Murray's personality best fit the goofy Baloo. Kaa's presence was drastically cut in comparison to the first film, but done rather well. The King Louie scene was probably the most different take, but the film in general replaced goofiness from the original with charm, or darkness. The CGI for the wolves and other characters was fantastic, and made for some heart warming scenes. The movie is still well worth watching, but I enjoyed the songs and tone of the first film more.",

I won't lie, I'm likely being biased with this review since I absolutely love the 1967 animated version of the film.

In diesem neuen Mix aus Animations- und Realfilm versucht sich Regisseur Jon Favreau an einem Spagat: Er breitet vor uns die verwunschene Stimmung der Vorlage aus, während sich die Figuren (und auch die Handlung) am Animationsfilm orientieren. Selbst ein paar Songs werden neu vertont! Neel Sethi spielt den zwölfjährigen Mogli, der im Dschungel ausgesetzt wird. Ein reines Vergnügen ist das an sich nicht für ein Kind, unter Tieren aufzuwachsen. Die Bedrohung durch eine gewisse Schlange sowie einen Tiger, der vom allzu menschlichen Trieb der Rache beherrscht wird, können wir dank CGI hier auch spüren! Immerhin wurden der Urwald sowie alle tierischen Insassen am Computer erschaffen. Wie ist das denn nun mit den eigenen Kindern?

The acting and voice acting was superb, the story was engaging, and the special effects - even in this day of CGI wonders - was executed to perfection.  I can't imagine special effects getting better until the time comes when we watch holograms and sniff olfactory chemicals in the cinemas of the future.

Sure, the Tiger carries the human-hate baggage a little too far, but in no way is the audience allowed to sympathize as his scarred face was accompanied by a ominous theme song each time he appeared on screen. The child actor was extremely annoying to watch, listen to. I ended up hating him before the movie was even finished.

            "content": "The Jungle Book was easily a Disney favorite as a child. How many times did I watch the cartoon? Beyond count. Then in 1994 came the first live action adaptation with Sam Neil and Cary Elwes, which was a solid take on the classic book. Now Disney takes another stab at making a live action adaptation of The Jungle Book, and at a point in time where Disney is rebooting all their classic cartoons to live action. Not a very likable time in my opinion. Outside of Pixar, Disney continues to keep originality on long term hold. This continuation to reboot and recycle the same material in Hollywood annoys me. The story is set, and it is pretty much the same story we've all grown to know and love. Now comes the part where a lot of recent films have failed. Seeing that the filmmakers actually gave a damn about telling the story as well as making the experience fun, rather than phoning in the project due to it's already established success. Jon Favreau is the director of this live action adaptation. With a unique filmography ranging from Made to Elf to Zathura to Iron Man to Chef, his take on the Rudyard Kipling book is both genuine and wonderful to watch. He completely homers here with The Jungle Book, which for me quickly became the first film since Mad Max: Fury Road where I was struck with complete awe and wonder. \nThe Jungle Book is a great journey from start to finish. It's not just another kids movie filled with over-the-top goofy corny G-rated gags. Nor is it another kids movie catering to an audience of just kids. When it's being funny the film is funny, when it's thrilling the film is exciting, when it's sad it even got an emotional response from me. With an A-list cast featuring great names like, Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, Christopher Walken, Idris Elba, and Lupita Nyong'o, the film is carried by one single live action performance from a 13 year-old actor named Neel Sethi. The pressure of Neel's performance as Mowglu was crucial to The Jungle Book, cause every other actor only had to lend their voice. The result, you could not ask for a better performance from a 13 year old, like the one Neel gives as Mowgli. He carries the whole film without needing a single adult actor to step in for help, even though there are some great scenes from both Bill Murray and Christopher Walken. Both steal the spotlight, but only for a little bit. Another key character to the film is the jungle itself. The film's jungle is structured heavily with CGI, and yet the film does not lose it's balance to it's effects. The visuals are certainly jaw-dropping and breathtaking, but they do remain a backdrop for the characters and the story. But what a beautiful backdrop the visual effects are in The Jungle Book. To be impressed by visual effects is becoming more and more of a rare thing these days. The Jungle Book's visuals did more than impress, they dazzled me with child-like glee.    \nTo watch Favreau's Jungle Book, was almost like being catapulted back through time and into a child-like state of mind where you find yourself laughing, smiling, and being  at the life's simplest things. Not since Babe has there been this great of a live action movie featuring talking animals. Jon Favreau knows exactly how to reach kid in all of us.",

            "content": "See more reviews like this at chrisbreviews.blogspot.com\n\nBefore I begin, I know what you're going to ask, and yes, they kept the Bear Necessities and I wanna be like you songs. There were a lot of considerable similarities and differences to the original actually. Similar: the characters, general plot, and songs. Different: certain events of the plot, new sub-plots, the closer attention to themes, and the overall quality of the film. This one was better.\n\nThis is a reboot of the original 1967 cartoon version of the film, and Director Favreau displayed his supreme directing skills in balancing the existing events of the original and giving older audiences some nostalgia and making the film more contemporary and making the characters and areas of plot a lot more three dimensional. This skill matches that of J.J. Abrams in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Without any spoilers, there are little changes in the plot that cause big ripple effects to what is the final product which may make some fans upset, but I found these changes to be welcoming and even required for this film to be a success. I will further explore each of these differences throughout the review. Needless to say, Favreau switched the film up in a way that made it deep, fulfilling, and entertaining for all audiences despite it being labelled as a children's movie.\n\nI did have some issues with the plot however- namely Shere Khan's role. In the beginning, Shere Khan, the ruthless bad guy tiger who kills animals all the time, shows jungle etiquette by giving Mowgli a head start to get out of the jungle before he kills him. How nice of you evil tiger. After one half-hearted attempt at snatching Mowgli, he devises a plan to take over the jungle (no spoilers, but something happens here) and, assuming word gets across to Mowgli, Mowgli will then come to Shere Khan and then he will kill him. So the element of a chase movie that was present in the '67 version was more lacking this time round. The tiger's patience gave Mowgli plenty of time to make new friends and have a couple sub-adventures. Even though for the larger portion of the film Khan didn't do much, he was a very scary and menacing villain in both destructive capabilities and in his manner; a worthy villain for the intelligent man-cub Mowgli. Different to 1967, he had motivation for going after Mowgli which made him a better and more intriguing character. His tale was very much a tale of revenge. I was scared of him! Parents: don't be surprised if your young one is scared too.\n\nFavreau brought the film quality, and a great cast to go with it! Even though most of these guys where voices, you could see characteristics of their face in their character's face- especially Walken's character, which I found very interesting. The cast included Neel Sethi, Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray, Idris Elba, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken, Lupita Nyong'o, and Giancarlo Esposito. All of their voices suited their characters perfectly. I loved re-exploring the chemistry and relationship between Mowgli and big bear Baloo. Each character brought with them their own tone when they were on-screen whether it was menacing, mysterious, lighthearted, tense, protective, or loving, this film was an emotional rollercoaster. This was actor Neel Sethi's first performance and he performed brilliantly, portraying Mowgli in a way that did justice to the character. I look forward to more of his work.\n\nGenres were extensive due to each character's contribution. There was action, adventure, comedy, drama, family, fantasy, and thriller. It blended each of these with great finesse and the movie had great balance. Thriller was a bold addition, but just made the film all the more satisfying. Our setting was, once again, the jungle. Themes played a big part in this movie including belonging, acceptance, sacrifice, morals, revenge, undeviating love, peace, prejudice, family, journey, and teamwork. While Walt Disney focussed on telling a fun story that lets the imagination explore, Favreau concentrated on recreating this world while making the film a deeper one to be enjoyed by a wider variety of audiences. The themes created valuable morals which young audiences can learn from. Win win.\n\nThe special effects were flawless, there wasn't one instance where I doubted that a character wasn't real. There were a couple of risks made in this one, but they all worked out fine. The script was also impeccable, there were some valuable gems in it. For those who have seen the film, I especially enjoyed the story told by Sheer Khan to the baby wolves, and the law of the jungle.\n\nThe running time was longer than the average for a family film, so young audiences attention spans may wander, but I was thoroughly engaged throughout. Although there were a lot of sequences part of the 'adventure', they weren't necessarily central to the story. This may bore some. The editing kept a fair ratio of screen time to Mowgli's adventure and what was happening meanwhile at the heart of the jungle. In terms of box office performance, I don't think it will get as much as it should get mainly due to the minimal marketing and potentially other films drowning it out.\n\nThe Jungle Book doesn't have heaps it could work on, but I would say that the monkey king sequence could've been cut out, there wasn't much contribution to the story, it was mainly just killing time which didn't need to be there in the first place. Maybe you could work on the element of the chase more.\n\nTo Conclude, this is one of the first family films that I can safely say adults will enjoy watching due to their relationship with the original and its excellent quality. It's got something for everyone. Favreau was successful in conveying the intended morals and I can say that The Jungle Book has a HIGH rewatchability level. It's not surprising that this film is excellent with Disney's almost flawless track record, and I'm looking forward to Disney's 2016 films such as Alice Through the Looking Glass, Finding Dory, and the BFG.",

            "content": "Disney arrives with a truly visionary and amazing film this 2016, this time a live action retelling of the classic Rudyard Kipling story, which they first adapted in 1967 as an animated film, though this film is more of an inspiration, going in its own direction, with a slightly darker spin and approach.\n\nThe film follows Mowgli, who seeks out a journey, aided by various animals, while the threatening and evil tiger Shere Khan attempts to kill him.\n\nThe film is a visual wonder and great treat, with a terrific cast. Newcomer Neel Sethi depicts Mowgli and is the only human actor in the film, since many of the actors are computer generated creations. Sethi does an amazing job, since as an actor, he has nothing to work with. He wonderfully commands the screen, making you believe in his journey, while remarkably depicting Mowgli as a strong-minded and strong-willed child. Throughout the entire film, he is able to command the film, while he also has great chemistry with the actors voicing the animals. He's not only believable, but delivers a performance of realism and believability. In all honesty, he truly deserves a nomination for Best Actor for managing to work with absolutely nothing on the film. The voice cast is impeccable and brilliantly picked. Ben Kingsley voices Bagheera as a general, with a true sense of command and knowledge, while he also shows compassion for Mowgli. Bill Murray is wonderful as Baloo, bringing the right amount comedy, while also appearing serious in scenes. Christopher Walken is terrific as King Louie, who is given a slightly larger appearance, as a secondary villain. Walken is menacing when he needs to be and friendly at other times. Scarlett Johansson is exceptional as Kaa, depicting the character with a more serious approach, instead of a comedic foil, which the animated film had done. The real standout in the voice cast, though, is Idris Elba, who voices Shere Khan. Elba is absolutely magnificent in the role, appearing splendidly evil, while allowing the character to be highly menacing, even off screen. Elba, as Shere Khan, has got to be one of the greatest Disney villains, since Jeremy Irons as Scar in The Lion King, Keith David as Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and Richard White as Gaston in Beauty and the Beast. Lupita Nyong'o and Giancarlo Esposito are also perfectly cast as the wolves that watch over Mowgli.\n\nJon Favreau masterfully directs this film, crafting a film that is not only original, but also full of magic and wonder. Favreau, who is probably mostly well-known to this generation for bringing Iron Man to life, is an amazing choice for this film and also seems like the best choice to deliver a new tale of The Jungle Book. Favreau crafts a film with real heart and relatable characters, successfully having us follow a young child on journey of self-discovery, while encountering danger at every turn. With the help of Favreau, as well as screenwriter Justin Marks, you not only relate with Mowgli, but also the countless characters he encounters on his journey. Marks, especially, manages to craft an original film as screenwriter that feels like something for a whole new generation. Bill Pope's cinematography is astounding, wonderfully switching color for every scene and location that Mowgli encounters. At times light, other times stark and dark, the lighting and camera angles are perfectly developed and handled, while this film also works well in 3D, primarily IMAX 3D. Watching it in 3D you feel like you are part of the film and action, while seeing it on a giant screen like IMAX further adds to the action and adventure in the Indian jungle and landscape. John Debney's score has a mystical feel to it, at times incorporating elements of the score from the 1967 film in a smart and genius manner. The songs The Bare Necessities, Trust In Me and I Wan'na Be Like You are interwoven brilliantly into the plot. While the film mainly relies on speaking, instead of singing, elements of the songs appear in speech, while the songs appear in full through the end credits. This approach perfectly goes along with the film, since switching to a musical for a short amount of time would seem awkward and out of style for a film that is approached in a more serious and darker manner.\n\nThe real treat of this film are the visual effects, which brilliantly and realistically bring the animals. While watching the film, I never thought that the animals were CGI, since they appear so life like, which one of the film's many successes. This is similar to Life of Pi, where the animals, mainly the tiger, were CGI, but in a very realistic approach. The animals in this film walk and sit like actual animals, proving that visual effects are constantly evolving and changing. I do believe that this will gain the film an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, which it truly deserves.\n\nThe end result is a film full of magic, while also proving that Disney can still deliver films of originality, with real heart, magic and wonder. While not a direct remake of the 1967 film, and in my opinion very superior, the film is more of a love letter, while also acting as a film for a whole new generation of film goers. Bravo! Bravo indeed!",

            "content": "Fantastic live action adaptation of the Jungle Book. Based on the animated The Jungle Book (1967) this version spins it slightly different and meanwhile still pays homage to the original. Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a young boy who's been raised by Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) a wolf along with the rest of her pack. Mowgli was brought to the wolf clan by the panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). When a massive drought hits the land the fearsome tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) returns and discovers the secret of Mowgli. Shere Khan gives the wolfs an ultimatum telling them when the water returns they must give the boy to him. Mowgli feeling like he's a problem to everyone decides to leave with Bagheera and be with his own people. On the way Mowgli comes across many different animals including the hypnotic snake Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), the goofy Baloo (Bill Murray) and an orangutan named King Louie (Christopher Walken) that has an agenda of his own. The movie has a lot of heart and you really feel for Mowgli and his situation. He's a stranger in a very strange world. Always trying to fit in, but never realizing that he's his own person. The film looks absolutely beautiful. Although, a lot of it is shot with CG it looks. The voice actors give life to the life like animals and everything blends together quite well. Small gripes could be the movie runs maybe about ten minutes too long (how many chase scenes do we need?), but the pacing outside of that is pretty well done. Overall, give it a look if you haven't checked it out!",

            "content": "I would say any further attempt to recreate another adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's eponymous classics The Jungle Book series is close to suicidal. Another film made to capture the hearts of both young and adult, with talking animals, creating the magical bond between a boy and a bear, and obviously extreme ineludible lengths of CGI dependency, not an easy task. We have had many versions produced in the past, some rather successful especially Disney's 1967 animated film version, and we've seen a variety of Mowglis as well, from Jason Scott Lee (1994) to Brandon Baker (1998). Nevertheless the trailer for Jon Favreau's version of The Jungle Book, the fourth and latest edition by Disney, was enthralling enough to bring me to the theatres. Still doubtful though about the storyline (forgive my skepticism, the screenwriter is after all Justin Marks who gave us the marvelous Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li in 2009) I knew I had to watch it in IMAX 3D to at least come out visually entertained. The verdict? Favreau's reimagining of Kipling's dense world of the wilderness is nothing less of spectacular, the screen is bursting with exuberant colors and movements, and watching the anthropomorphic animals going about in their adventures is surprisingly absorbing. Twitter is already calling it \"The Revenant\" for kids, as it brings the children tale into a darker level, with some thrilling scenes which can be quite overwhelming for younger audience.\nStaying close to the 1967 animation storyline, it tells the story of orphaned Mowgli (Neel Sethi) who is found by panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) and raised in the wilderness by a pack of wolves led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito), along with Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) who cared for him like one of her own cubs. Peppy but docile, Mowgli soaks in all life lessons taught by his mentors and guardians, and yearns to grow up to be just like the wolves in his pack. His childhood is however abruptly shaken when a nefarious tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) visits and demands that Mowgli be turned over to him for an unsettled vengeance from the past. Reluctantly, the orphan decides to leave Raksha and the rest of his family, whilst Bagheera concludes further that it is in fact time for Mowgli to leave the jungle altogether and join his own species, pivoting a series of both enlightening and treacherous adventures including meeting Baloo (Bill Murray) the friendly bear, witty and blithe in spirit, Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) the seductive serpent, and King Louie (Christopher Walken) the ape who seeks ultimate power in the animal kingdom.\nEntrancing, Favreau's Jungle Book is a visual achievement. The handsome lush Indian landscapes with the clever combination of realistic and fantastical elements provide one of the most interesting, photorealistic all-digital climate to any films we have come across. With ten year-old Sethi being the only live-actor role and the entire story filmed in a studio in LA, Favreau has managed to re-create the beloved classic with a muscle, where his usual mastery in action sequences are put to efficient use, and at the same time coming off emotionally moving. I like the way Mowgli's humanity (and his \"man tricks\") which inevitably draws him away from his animal families and home, is used as the central theme of the story, but eventually becoming his ultimate weapon to win the battle and find his way \"home\". Much is put into work to make sure that the animals talk and move in the most realistic manner. You can almost \"see\" the actors when the animals emote, especially for Shere Khan, Baloo and Bagheera. And for me, it was Sethi's endearing portrayal of the man-cub that stole my heart. A perfect casting choice. \"I think it's time to update the story and the themes a little bit for this generation,\" Favreau shared when explaining the importance of using CGI the right way. Indeed he pulled it off, one example of CGI put to good use. So good, that both Favreau and screenwriter Marks are already in talks with Disney to return for Jungle Book 2.",

Violence and death enter the realm of what was a Disney classic with little or no reason for it. 2)Beautifully done animals that aren't quite real in some way-shape-or form. It is hard to put my finger on just what is wrong with them.  All l can say is they were too perfect. Like rosy cheeked kids starving on an island. It just wasn't - right. King Kong as an orangutan? I'm sorry but to me that was dumb. Mowgli? The kid was fantastic! Loved his acting. But the rest? My wife fell asleep several times and she was the one who really wanted to go see the film. I think if the director had just transported the animated version to real life (as per the OTHER Jungle Book movie Disney made) that they would have had a real hit on their hands. The kid steals the show.  Maybe that is what was wrong - the animals were trying too hard to steal the show? I don't know.  All I can say is - if you put the first Narnia next to this movie and watched them both - I am sure you would understand where I am coming from.  Narnia - The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe - is perfectly done.  Everything fits together perfectly, all of the animatronics is flawless, the CGI is flawless and it all works. This - it just doesn't. There is just something wrong with it. That's all I can say.",

The visuals are incredible considering their creation in a warehouse in LA. The voice performances are all spot on. Neel Sethi is delightfully wide-eyed as Mowgli. Bill Murray is dryly amusing as Baloo, Ben Kingsley wise and stern as Bagheera, Idris Elba menacing and intimidating as Shere Khan and Lupita Nyong'o warm as Raksha. Christopher Walken puts in a fine speaking voice but when the film busts out in a weird and creepy rendition of 'I Wanna Be Like You\", Walken can't quite hit the pitches. Scarlet Johansson even gets a wonderfully unnerving scene as Kaa. If there was any proble,s with the film other than the awkward inclusion of two musical numbers, it would be in the CGI which looks gorgeous but can distract at times where it is more noticeable than others. However, the film is consistently enjoyable and the action finale is edge of your seat stuff. Disney's live action reboots continue to surprise. Here's to Beauty and the Beast. Rating: 86",

            "content": "For a film where the cast is almost entirely voice acting, and a jungle made by CGI, The Jungle Book soars to new heights since its Disney premiere in 1967. I'll admit, I was always a fan of the original classic from the 60s, but expected the remake to be just a visually stunning version of the same script. Instead, we are given more background on the main character, Mowgli, as well as a deeper dive into the characters that were left on the back burner by the original animators. Of course, our classic heroes Bagheera and Baloo, as well as the trickster, King Louie, and the villainous Shere Khan, all make an appearance, but we also get to take a look at other characters, most importantly the wolf family that Mowgli is sheltered in since birth. Director Jon Favreau puts a spotlight on the aspect of family, using the wolves as a centerpiece of the film. The choice to highlight these creatures, brought to life brilliantly by Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad) and Lupita Nyong'o (Star Wars: The Force Awakens, 12 Years a Slave), along with an adorable batch of wolf cubs who bring \"aww\"s and smiles to every moviegoers eyes, is brilliant in putting heart into an otherwise emotion lacking film. Of course, Bill Murray's Baloo is a masterwork and delivers most of the laughs in the film as well, and Ben Kingsley's Bagheera is so perfect that you could listen to him talk for hours and hours, and just love it more and more. Scarlett Johansson has a smaller role than the typical Kaa from the original film, but still delivers a credible vocal performance, bringing the expected chill from her soft voice that captured our attention in Spike Jonze's \"Her\" in 2013. Now for the BEST and WORST of the vocal performances: starting with the best, Idris Elba as Shere Khan the tiger. His vocal presence is perfect for the villain, and sends chills down the spine, and a sense of fear to the audience in a fantasized story like this. Christopher Walken, on the other hand, falls a bit flat for me. His voice doesn't fit the size and power that his character, King Louie, has, and his song is almost unbearable to listen to. The monkey scene is a tad drawn out and the song doesn't bring the intended excitement to the scene either, given Walken's soft tone and the monkey's lazy stature, and lack of movement. Regardless, the CGI in the film is incredible, and much credit is given to Neel Sethi, the man cub himself. His acting isn't good, but the ability to keep up with a blank set and simply voices is what gives him the impressive edge, and makes the performance bearable. The jungle is beautiful to look at, and the long pans of sunsets, jungle brush, animal herds, and water is breathtaking, and help make this the most beautiful film that Disney has ever made. Similar to Ang Lee's \"Life of Pi,\" the CGI in the animals is almost unrecognizable, and there's really no sense of gimmick or lack of detail. The detail is so precise, from the shed snake skin to Shere Khan's damaged left eye, making the animators and visual effects artists the true champions here. The voice acting is excellent, but what elevates this from the original is the visual masterpiece that we are treated to. This will not leave you disappointed, and is a fun watch for any age or type, packing song, jokes, and lots of heart into a quick 106 minutes of boundless joy.",

Its voice cast generally gives these creatures new life on screen though this movies version of Baloo definitely is not as likable as Phil Harris version.  With some dark moments it might scare some small children and its performance from its child lead leaves something to be desired but despite this I highly recommend giving this visual treat a watch",

I was blown away by the amazing visual effects, pleasantly surprised by the writing and by the story, and really believed in the voice acting and CGI-animated characters as well as the great debut performance by Neel Sethi who brought new, likable, clever, and fun characteristics to Mowgli.  If you were worried about the trend of Disney recreating their animated classics into live-action, fear not.  If they are anything like The Jungle Book, or Cinderella, especially with bringing about the right directors, writers, and team, then we can expect good things from more upcoming films like Beauty and The Beast.",

            "content": "Watching Disney's 'The Jungle Book (2016)' is an exhilarating, terrifying, fun time. Disney and Director, Jon Favreau have taken the two-dimensional, coloring book cut out characters, of the original Jungle Book; Mowgli; the man-cub abandoned in the jungle when he was just a baby and raised by wolves, Bagheera; the devoted, black panther who has vowed to protect the helpless man-cub he found, Baloo; the opportunistic, laid-back bear who grew to love the man-cub, Shere Khan; the menacing vile tiger that vows to kill the man-cub, Kaa; the snake with the hypnotizing stare is intent on making the man-cub her dinner, Raksha; the kind, loving she-wolf; the only mother the man-cub has ever known, and King Louie; the orangutan leader of the monkey army who kidnaps the man-cub, for his enjoyment, and transformed them into larger than life, anthropomorphic, CGI brilliance.  \n\nThere is one thing for certain, this is not your grandma's Jungle Book. It's even better. It's edgy, it's exciting, it's spectacular. It is terrifying. Shere Khan (Idris Elba) makes Scar, of 'The Lion King' and Disney's previously most vile feline, look like Bambi. He vows to kill the man-cub just like he killed the man-cub's father. Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) recognizes the man-cub's need of the 'peoples'. It becomes apparent exactly how much the safety of the entire jungle is threatened by Mowgli's mere presence, when Shere Khan (Idris Elba) violently murders Akela (Giancarlo Esposito), the Alpha-wolf that adopted Mowgli. As Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) bids her man-cub farewell, her love and sheer sorrow pulls the audience into her sense of loss. Bagheera escorts Mowgli on an epic journey out of the jungle to find the 'peoples' village. The journey is fraught with danger. Mowgli, all the while, must stay ahead of Shere Khan. We meet Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), the enormous she-snake that tries to hypnotize Mowgli into becoming her next willing meal; Baloo (Bill Murray) an enormous giant of a bear equipped with claws, teeth, and lack of morals, becomes Mowgli's best friend. We encounter the absolutely terrifying monkey army that delivers Mowgli to King Louie (Christopher Walken), enormous and red. King Louie is the jungle's own mob boss. His appetite for papaya and power is insatiable. Mowgli and his companions are tested by every danger the jungle contains. Mowgli leaves the legend of the man-cub and the jungle behind, to begin life with the 'peoples' but not before his battle to the death, with Shere Khan.  \n\nUsually remakes of classic movies leave the audience let down. Not this remake. 'The Jungle Book (2016)' remains true to the original, complete with the dancing and singing we loved from the original. 'The Jungle Book (2016)' is a work of cinematic genius. Special effects and CGI are mind numbing. However, I would refrain from taking small children to see this movie. The majority of this movie is terrifying. I was at the end of my seat, my hands ready to cover my eyes. Director, Jon Favreau, did a fantastic job keeping with the feeling of original without making it feel dated. The casting is amazing. But it is 12-year old Neel Sethi, cast as Mowgli, that has a brilliant career ahead of himself. His portrayal of Mowgli is warm, engaging, thoughtful, relevant, and most of all believable. The only human of the movie, Sethi's entire performance is alongside a green screen.\n\nRudyard Kipling would be proud.\n\nI give this movie 4 of 5 'fresh tomatoes', due to how frightening this movie is.",
