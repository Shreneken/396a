Taking leave of his job as a janitor in Boston, Lee reluctantly returns to Manchester-by-the-Sea, the fishing village where his working-class family has lived for generations. There, he is forced to deal with a past that separated him from his wife, Randi (Michelle Williams), and the community where he was born and raised.",

He's also uncommunicative. He acts out once a tiny bit, once a little more. There are some matters like a divorce, a nephew, and a boat. There are kids, young people, middle-aged people, and old people. People talk; some talk more, some talk less. \u2014And that's it, folks!",

It reminded me a bit of that other Casey Affleck film where he has to protect his daughter from all the rapey men, but much more understated.

As for the plot, the main plot point wasn't predictable, and the writing was well executed in terms of providing increasing amounts of detail as time went on, developing the main character. However, it did feel somewhat uneventful and repetitive (e.g. predictable bar fights), there was quite a lot of needless swearing, not much was learnt about the brother, the flashback transitions were a bit confusing, and the ending could've been better, although I get the message they were going for. The film also dragged on in places, and the tone was pretty miserable, but I didn't find it had much emotional impact on me as a viewer, probably because of how easy it was to hate the characters. On the other hand, the acting was strong, the cinematography, visual effects, and editing were above average, and the classical soundtrack was pleasant.",

I was less sure of Hedges, and felt that the experience became weaker when he was on the screen due admittedly to some weak and random plot points that included his multiple girlfriends and them having sex practically in front of their guardians. Ultimately, the two hours waste little, but become aimless as time drags on and it becomes clear that the conflict does not evolve or strike profound evolutions in the personages. The characters, especially the protagonist, pique interest enough to ensure that Lonergan's skilled work, along with a magnificent score and a unique New England setting, and that the attention and awards given were not completely undeserved.",

The performances are similarly raw, and so it draws you into these people's lives. And as we watch the aftermath of one tragedy unfold, the perfectly interwoven flashbacks shed light on a past tragedy that colors who Lee is today. [SPOILER]: the scene in the precint where Leo goes to shoot himself with an officer's gun and yelps a \"please\" as he's wrestled to the ground is one that moistens the eyes. \n\nIt's painful to watch a broken man resist self-forgiveness and avoid companionship with his remaining friends and family. This film is an authentic representation of that, and that's a credit to the writing and the performances.\n\nI felt it dragged a bit toward the end; I noticed that I was less engaged than I was in the first hour.

This forces him to return to his hometown and confront his past.\n\nManchester by the Sea is one of the strongest/genuine if not the strongest/genuine drama films I have ever seen. A deep/sad story that the cast & crew made it 10x better and unique whether it's the directing, cinematography, or the acting. The film is absolutely great.\n\nThe script is very well written and unique especially when telling the backstory, it'll take you a while to release that this specific scene is a flashback which was a bad thing at the beginning of the film because it was casing a little bit of confusion especially when I didn't know the characters so well and who's who but after that it actually starts to be obvious and it starts to look like a very great way of telling a backstory. Each scene seems like it was written so well and in a way to take the audience on an emotional/dramatic ride, which the acting, set design, and directing made then even more emotional/dramatic. The dialogues were so REALISTIC and that's thanks to the great acting performances and the screenplay. I think without one of these elements, we would've not had this beautiful result, both of them worked together to give us such dramatic/emotional dialogues that would make the audience emotional.\n\nThe acting performance of each actor/actress was genuinely very well done. Michelle Williams didn't appear much in the film. But, when she did, she absolutely killed it. Lucas Hedges gave his role the nephew an amazing little unique touch, a great choice. And the incredible Casey Affleck who proved to everyone that he is so talented and can put on a performance that will live for ages.\n\nThe film's pace was a bit cold and slow which caused troubles in the first hour of the film and specifically before explaining the backstory. I felt bored a bit and didn't know where the film was going but after the backstory was explained, the film became much better and started to all make sense. \n\nManchester by the Sea is a \"must-watch\". If you want a deep/emotional/sad/dramatic film that has great acting performances, then this is the perfect film for you. \n\nMy rating is 9/10",

The muted tones of the north east USA fits the somber mood of the film extremely well.

It's likely the true fire starter film to the Academy's proposed inclusion of an \"Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film\" award.\n\nI personally found Casey Affleck to be very solid but short of mesmerizing as a janitor forced to care for his deceased brother's boy. I enjoyed the film itself far more than the collective acting. But regardless of the nits and gnats, The Academy's recent consideration to recognize blockbusters -- while largely frowned upon by alarmist film snobs -- is perhaps it's the best conciliatory olive branch available, allowing fine films like \"Manchester By The Sea\" to earn its deserved recognition, yet not without an equalizing tip of the cap to public sentiment.\n\nThis is a very good movie that falls short of an eternal masterpiece, and perhaps might be best remembered long-term by its contribution to a larger public debate between the need to champion great storytelling while also allowing the voices of the masses to also be heard.",

            "content": "This is the sort of film that you have to watch in the right mood, if you don't want to be left broken and in tears or just plain angry. I came to the film as a fan of Kenneth Lonergan, his two previous films are among the best of the 21st century, so I was expecting dark and depressing material and a very flawed main character. The other expectation I had coming into the film was that it would contain great acting and this proved to be true as Casey Affleck and Lucas Hedges give beautiful performances. This is a film that deserves to be savored and it is filled with incredibly emotional moments that are painful to watch but have the sort of realism that clings to all of Lonergan's productions.\n\nLee Chandler, Casey Affleck, is a depressed janitor working in Quincy, Massachusetts who is called back to his hometown of Manchester by the Sea after the death of his brother Joe, Kyle Chandler. In his will Joe outlines that he wants Lee to become the legal guardian of his son Patrick, Lucas Hedges, and remain in Manchester by the Sea. Patrick and Lee bond as they struggle after the death of a beloved family member and while Patrick juggles multiple girlfriends and Lee's past comes back to haunt him. His inability to change leaves you frustrated with him and yet he is sympathetic in his complete lack of desire to confront his dark past.\n\nLonergan's screenplay, as with all of his screenplays, is very naturalistic in most of it's interactions with this being punctuated by moments of intense violence and emotional conflict where problems aren't necessarily dealt with. When Patrick awkwardly tries to connect with Lee he speaks like a real, immature teenager not like the precocious invention of a middle aged screenwriter. The actors deserve credit for their work in crafting these characters of course but they are given a tight, deliberate script to work with that forces them to act between the lines. The lack of dialogue that Lee receives conveys his utter hopelessness as Randi's monologue shows her own desperation and enduring love for her ex-husband, everything in the screenplay has been so well thought out that it's not surprising it won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award.\n\nThe best part of the film is undoubtedly the performance of Affleck as he exquisitely portrays a broken shell of a man. Although I won't reveal what he is lost we do understand in the film that Lee was once a happy and fulfilled but still significantly troubled man. The way that we see him throughout most of the film however is as a man who refuses to express emotion for fear of the pain of his past fully resurfacing. His reticence hurts those around him as his selfishness and anger is displayed by Affleck's soulless eyes and tightly pulled lips. He never makes his character sympathetic but if he were to even attempt that the film wouldn't work and his unmoved posturing throughout fits the character perfectly.\n\nThe other standout performances, everyone in this film is great, are those of Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges who each get moments to shine. Hedges get several arguments with Affleck to tear into and he manages to match him as their interplay with one another is spiky but loving, reminiscent of Sammy and Terry in You Can Count On Me (2000). His teenager is self-possessed, arrogant and very na\u00c3\u00afve, in other words he is a normal teenager. Williams is incredible as she inhabits a character who may be even more traumatized than Lee and sells the pain that this woman would have held with her for years so well. I was awed by their abilities and completely believed in their characters and their motivations even when they made strange choices.\n\nThis is a great exploration of several troubled people with dark pasts who try as they might can't find it in themselves to change. It leaves you as hollow as it's main character but that's the intent of the film, understanding grief should not be a pleasant experience. This is a film that should be watched if you are prepared for an intense emotional experience.",

            "content": "The Oscar season this year hasn't appeared very promising. After watching the Golden Globes, I felt even less interested. Coupled with the fact that it is mid-January and I've seen one movie in 2 months, and only one real Oscar-level contender, \"Hell or High Water,\" which was a disappointment, I haven't been very excited. Today I chose to see the one movie that promises to be a contender and actually looked interesting to me, \"Manchester By the Sea.\" \n\nAnother New England-centric drama by the Affleck/Damon clan,along with recent addition of John Krazinski, didn't fill me with a lot of hope. However, the trailer looked good when I saw \"Nocturnal Animals back in early November, plus the buzz and Casey Affleck's Golden Globe win sold me. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away.\n\n\"Manchester By the Sea\" isn't a bad movie. It's head and shoulders above most of the drivel in theaters today. The acting is pretty darn good, the setting is lovely and the story has a lot of potential. For the newbie, Amazon Studios, which has been more hit than miss, it seemed like its inaugural legit hit. And, for the most part, it's been perceived that way with a 97% Rottentomatoes critic score. I simply don't get this. Again, the movie isn't bad, but it isn't anything special.\n\nI'm the first to criticize films that are \"too\" Hollywood. This movie isn't. \n\nI'm the first to criticize films that are too easy to predict. This movie isn't.\n\nI'm the first to criticize films that have perfectly defined bookend starts and finishes. This movie doesn't.\n\nI'm the first to criticize movies that have an ending that isn't an ending. This movie really isn't that either. \n\nSo...why is it barely above average to me? Well, \"Manchester By the Sea\" had some familiar story elements that have steered my emotions into places that stick with me long after the film is over. They make me go back to the movie and watch it over and over. It's these kind of elements that give richness to the characters. What's weird about this film, though, is while there is a lot of depth to the characters, the story is pieced together in such a way that you really don't fully grasp the depth of issues in Casey Affleck's character, Lee, until near the end. I'm guessing that's intentional, but at 2 hours and 15 minutes, it just annoys me. The movie is entirely too long with a myriad of inexplicable starts and stops that appear to lead nowhere. They seem to be placed in the story to explain certain pieces, but then are left alone. The result is a spoon-fed story that makes the emotions we are supposed to be feeling, artificial.\n\nThe plot has a ton of potential. It's rooted in a sad subject that the strong acting is capable of executing in a powerful way, but the story, or at least the editing, prevent it from doing so. Repeatedly. This choppiness and eventual petered-out ending left me feeling like this was a college film. Certainly not worthy of the Oscar buzz.\n\n\"Manchester By the Sea\" suffer under the weight of its topic. The characters trying to carry this story to its eventual finish line are frequently readjusting their place in it, causing ripples in the flow of the film, making it hard to fully appreciate the writer/director's intent.",

This guy is way worse...\nMANCHESTER BY THE SEA\nThis was the film that, along with Birth of a Nation (R.I.P), had the earliest Oscar buzz. From the start there were promises of gold for this feature film who featured the \"other Affleck\" as the main character. This, along with the actual accolades and Oscar noms, caused my expectations to be high and the film didn't quite live up to them. This film is what you'd call an \"Oscar movie\", i.e. a very good film that the Oscars overhype, considering it one of the best of the year. And it really is one of the best dramas of the year, but if you take genre and foreign films into consideration, it will rank lower. The movie is too long, its replay value is near to 0 and it's too common and quiet in nature. Like the boat being rocked in the beginning, the movie just stands. Despite this, the movie is so grounded on reality, that it grips you in for a sad ride. This is achieved mainly by three things: the realistic performances of Williams, Hedges but chiefly Casey Affleck who delivers a heartfelt and inherently miserable character study. Hollywood is in dire need of performances like this which depict how a person would react to a situation, not how an actor would perform it. He's just a regular man inner reacting to the pille on of sad situations (in that sense I compare it to Hank's Sully); the other thing is Lonergan's direction who tries to be inventive and select the shots according to emotions, not according to action and he isn't afraid to stay far and cut slow when necessary; the final thing is the film's strongest asset, the screenplay. While the structure provides meaning, the dialogue (and its lack) are a reminder that people can talk realistically on film. It's smart but never quipy, it's complex but never pretencious. Furthermore, the use of music is something to behold proving that sometimes you don't need  a composer for every second. It's a wellcrafted, depressingly Oscarmade movie that you'll watch once and say \"ok,  that's enough\". Still, worth the watch!",

The protagonist is Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck), a janitor and handyman in Quincy, Massachusetts, who lives a solitary life in a basement apartment. His interaction with the tenants of the apartment complex where he works is minimal. After being reprimanded by his boss for swearing at an irritated tenant, he gets into a drunken bar fight with two businessmen because he believes they were \"looking\" at him. While shoveling snow, Lee receives word that his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) has suffered cardiac arrest. Joe dies before Lee can get to the hospital, and Lee insists on being the one to tell Joe's teenage son, Patrick (Lucas Hedges), about Joe's death. While making funeral arrangements, they learn that Joe's body cannot be buried until spring when the ground thaws, and it needs to be kept refrigerated until then, so Lee remains in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts until the delayed burial. While reading Joe's will with Joe's lawyer, Lee is shocked to discover that Joe named him Patrick's guardian. Lee once lived in Manchester with his then-wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and their three small children, until his negligence while intoxicated led to a house fire that killed the children. No criminal charges were filed against him; however, after being questioned at the police station, Lee pulled a gun from a police officer's holster and attempted suicide. In light of these events, Lee remains reluctant to commit to the guardianship and unwilling to move back to Manchester, where the locals treat him as an outcast. Even so, he is opposed to Patrick's reconnecting with his mother, Elise and so Lee begins planning for Patrick to move to Boston with him. Patrick, who is deeply rooted in the Manchester community, strongly objects to the idea. Lee only commits to staying through the end of the school year. Over time, Patrick and Lee reestablish their bonds, although conflict continues to arise between them when it comes to making decisions about Joe's boat, Patrick's girlfriends, and their future living arrangements. Over Lee's objections, Patrick notifies Elise of Joe's death by email, and she invites him to have lunch with her. She has found Christianity and sobriety with her fianc\u00e9, Jeffrey, but during an awkward meal with them, Patrick finds himself unable to connect with her. Patrick is further unsettled when Jeffrey emails him, insisting on being an intermediary in any future communication between Patrick and his mother. Additionally, Lee's positive comments about Elise's sobriety lead Patrick to believe that his uncle is trying to get rid of him, straining their relationship even more. As a result, Lee takes some steps to possibly extend his stay in Manchester, and he begins to seek ways to spend more time with Patrick...\n\nManchester by the Sea received critical praise for Lonergan's direction and screenplay and for the performances of Affleck, Williams and Hedges, with Rolling Stone calling it the \"must-see film\" of the 2016 Sundance Festival. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Manchester by the Sea delivers affecting drama populated by full-bodied characters, marking another strong step forward for writer-director Kenneth Lonergan.\". Giving the film five-out-of-five stars, Phil de Semlyen of Empire called the film \"masterfully told and beautifully acted\" and favorably compared Affleck's performance to that of Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront, saying \"there's not much higher praise than that.\" Justin Chang of Variety said it was a \"beautifully textured, richly enveloping drama.\" Critic Peter Travers said the movie \"ranks with the year's very best films,\" and that \"it takes a piece out of you.\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film four-out-of-four stars, stating that it is \"the kind of movie you'll want to see a second time with someone who hasn't seen it yet, to remember what it was like to watch it for the first time.\" Anthony Lane with The New Yorker called the film \"carefully constructed, compellingly acted, and often hard to watch.\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said that \"the exquisitely crafted, emotionally ragged Manchester doesn't just ask for time and effort; it earns it.\". The scene which drew the most critical praise featured the characters Randi and Lee speaking again years after their divorce. Anthony Lane called it the \"highlight\" of the movie. Speaking of William's performance, Tom Shone said that \"if this actress were put on earth to do one thing only, it would be this scene.\"[14] Zoller called the scene \"a duet of mortification and mercy that stacks up with the best of Mike Leigh (Secrets and Lies)...The effect is cathartic.\" Affleck says he strove to show restraint while acting the scene, explaining, \"The challenge was to have all of those feelings and hold it without weeping and wailing and gnashing your teeth. To be there, and not be there.\"\n\nManchester by the Sea received critical acclaim upon its release and was counted among the best films of 2016. Critics praised in particular Affleck's performance, as well as Lonergan's screenplay and direction. For the 89th Academy Awards, the film received six nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Affleck), Best Supporting Actor (Hedges), Best Supporting Actress (Williams), and Best Original Screenplay-winning for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. Affleck also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and the film itself was nominated in four more categories at the Golden Globes.\n\n\"Manchester by the Sea\" wasn\u00b4t what I hoped for. With all the praise it has been given, I found myself not being pleased by what I saw. The film is overly static, the script doesn\u00b4t seem like it has been finished before the production started, it has a strange scene structure and editing, all the flashbacks don\u00b4t work fully in my mind, it was not as emotional as I hoped would be (it only really touched me properly during the fire scene) and the acting is a bit wobbly. Part of the problem is as well that you don\u00b4t really feel any sympathy for Lee nor Patrick. With that said, you can\u00b4t deny that Casey Affleck gives us a wonderful performance as the ghostlike, depressed and lost Lee. But, that\u00b4s not enough when the rest of the film suffers from so many flaws in my opinion.",

Twenty years later he can trade Oscars with his Brother who has at least two but none for acting. Keeping it all in the family so to speak Matt Damon produced this opus. The director also wrote the screen play for which he too got an Oscar. Produced by Amazon. \n\nWhat makes this film special is the fact that the characters are ordinary down on their luck working people. Lee Chandler is the caretaker/handyman for a group of Brownstones in the Boston area. \n\nUnlike the Mr. America wannabes on Riverdale Casey does not affect a six-pack though he shovels snow with alacrity. The sound quality on this disk is somewhat lacking making the dialogue often hard to follow. The language used is working class, the behaviour rough and tumble, bar room brawls and on ice fights. The classical often sacred music in the score often seems off-kilter with the action onscreen. \n\nLee and his 16-year-old nephew Patrick love one another but their relationship is not touch feely. Through flash backs we learn of the tragedies that have caused Lee to shut down emotionally and why coming back home is the last thing he wants to do. Both Lee and his brother Joe are divorced. \n\nFrom IMDB one learns the production team shot in Manchester by the Sea and its police chief, fire, and EMT Staff participated in the filming, ironic because on camera the paramedics have trouble getting the guerney into the truck. \n\nA great deal of repressed emotion makes this a difficult film to watch at times. Lee expresses his in anger which comes out when he is drinking though in bar room brawls, not at home. This film makes the audience feel uncomfortable Casey's performance obviously the kind that members of the Academy admire.",

The dialogue and performances are very realistic and raw with excellent performances from Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams in particular. It's also unlike most Hollywood movies in that it isn't over dramatic in the slightest, all of the performances are very subtle and subdued and that adds to the depths of the characters and the story as a whole. Sometimes the pacing is a bit too slow, the scenes with the nephew and his two girlfriends seem particularly pointless and take away from the tension of the film.

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, can t you see that it s time to review Manchester by the Sea?\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Its the end of the Oscar year and about time for a serious movie. Let s recap.\n\nSCOTT: We meet Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck), a handyman who lives in Boston and whose job is to fix the plumbing and electrical problems of the tenants in several apartment buildings. Lee appears to be a loner and gets into occasional bar fights. Yet for the most part, he is kind and gentle. One day he gets a telephone call telling him that his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) has died.\n\nGREG: Lee travels from Boston to his hometown of Manchester to meet with friends and family of Joe s. It seems Joe has left behind a small boat, a house, and a son, Patrick (Lucas Hedges). While Lee attends to Joe s funeral needs, he stops by the lawyer s to check on Joe s will. Since Joe had a degenerative heart condition, he made sure all his affairs were in order. Lee is surprised beyond words when he learns that Joe has made him Patrick s guardian. Joe has left enough money for Lee to move from Boston and take residence in his home. But Lee doesn t want this new responsibility and is strangely opposed to moving back to Manchester.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Manchester by the Sea is one of those rare movies that takes its time telling its story and developing its characters. There are scenes that don t seem necessary yet speak volumes about the kind of people we are getting to know, as when Lee Chandler misunderstands his nephew Patrick and almost inadvertently hurts him with his car. Scenes are also extended to include seemingly superfluous dialogue, yet in this movie even small talk looms large in revealing character details. Casey Affleck is highly deserving of all the kudos he is receiving for his performance here. In truth, almost all the performances here are dynamic and convincing. We see the pain in these characters  eyes and we care deeply about how their messy predicaments can get resolved. This movie pulls no punches about what Richard Rohr calls  the tragic sense of life . There are no villains here; life s difficult circumstances crop up and grab our hero by the throat, forcing him to make decisions and take risks. This is compelling drama, portrayed with heartfelt realism.\n\nGREG: I couldn t agree more. This is a story with no winners. Death leaves Lee holding the bag and it doesn t make his life easy. He is hesitant to move back to Manchester and we re left wondering why. Then, through a series of flashbacks, we re shown that he once had a family in Manchester. While things weren t perfect, they were pretty good. And then one night he accidentally burned down his house, killing his three young children. Afterwards, he, his wife, and the town, could not forgive him. He is forced to leave Manchester and take up residence in Boston doing odd jobs. When he is given the chance to return to Manchester, he at first rejects this  call to adventure.  He doesn t want to try and make it all work. But as he becomes more attached to his nephew and the town he left, we see him attempt to find work. But he is turned away. The town still hasn t forgiven or forgotten what he did. Ultimately, he finds a middle ground. Patrick will be adopted by friends, and he will regain his full birthright at the age of 21. Lee will relocate to a closer job in Boston so he can be a part of Patrick s life. It s not a Hollywood happy ending. It s not what anyone really wants. But in the circumstances that Lee, Patrick and Manchester find themselves, it is the best that can be done.\n\nSCOTT: Lee desperately needs a mentor to help him with his life decisions, especially regarding what to do with caring for Patrick. This movie shows us how agonizing life s difficult circumstances can be when person lacks help from a trusted mentor figure. Lee s older brother Joe, now deceased, probably served as a quasi-mentor figure for Lee, but now Joe s gone. Lee s parents are pretty useless in helping Lee, his vitriolic mother especially. Lee is left in the role of mentor for his nephew and finds himself ill-equipped to perform in this role, mostly because Lee himself hasn t properly come to terms with his past. He s an emotionally shattered man who has shut down. In the end, Lee finds a compromise regarding his nephew, an arrangement that is far from perfect but is the best Lee can do, especially considering the fact that he lacks any kind of mentoring.\n\nGREG: I think you re right again, Scott. This movie proves that you don t need a mentor for the hero. But there are consequences for the mentorless soul. The hero goes looking for answers but finds none. The hero looks for solutions but finds none. This is a story of a man thrown into a position of responsibility, but a responsibility that he cannot handle. He does his best, but his best is not good enough. Manchester by the Sea is a heart-rending story of a man looking for redemption, but finds none. It is an honest story about a man fractured by his own guilt. The story unfolds, not slowly, but deliberately. Each scene takes its time showing us the events of a man trying to cope with the responsibility that he didn t ask for. We want Lee to succeed. We even need him to succeed. But he won t succeed. It s not the story we want to see. But in life, it s often the story we re dealt. I give Manchester by the Sea 5 out of 5 Reels for telling a story that is as honest as a movie can be. Lee Chandler appears to be a decent fellow in the beginning of the film. He serves his tenants and keeps to himself. His one vice is that he seems to pick fights in bars - even preferring them to advances by attractive women. Although he doesn t want the responsibility of taking care of his orphaned nephew, we witness him doing his best. This is the hero within him. He tries. He tries very hard. And in the end he cannot overcome the tragedy that he brought upon himself. He is guilt-ridden and broken. He is the tragic hero who gets 4 out of 5 Heroes from me. As you point out, Scott, there are no mentors in this film. And that is part of what Manchester by the Sea is about. Lee is mentorless at a time when he could most use a mentor. He has no champion. And in the end, he loses to circumstance. If he had a mentor, things might have gone differently. It seems unfair to award this film zero mentor points since it succeeded in telling this tale without one. But as there is no mentor, 0 Mentor points is all I can offer. Movie: Mentors: 0 Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Manchester by the Sea is a heart-achingly realistic portrayal of a damaged man doing his best to cope with a family emergency. This movie pulls no emotional punches; it tells a tough story and does it with searing truth. Casey Affleck does a phenomenal job portraying Lee Chandler and deserves strong Oscar consideration. I can t think of an actor who is more gifted at showing pain through his eyes and nonverbal behavior. I award this film 4 Reels out of 5. The heroic path of Lee Chandler is fascinating and unconventional from the standpoint of the classic hero s journey. He is independent to a fault, resisting efforts to bond with people who could grow close to him and help him with much-needed healing. There are no villains, only inner-demons to conquer. Lee s story is hard to watch at times yet ultimately redemptive. I award his character 4 Hero points out of 5. While there is no mentor for poor, suffering Lee Chandler, he does nevertheless serve as a mentor figure for his nephew Patrick. How effective Lee is in this role is open to debate. Patrick needs a mentor almost as badly as Lee does, and we get the sense that the loss of Joe has created a big mentorship void in the entire family. Ironically, the conspicuous absence of mentorship in this film gives it prominence. Thus I give the mentorship in the film a total of 2 Mentor points out of 5. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:",

His acting here is not terrible by any means, but it is not Oscar caliber.  The same can be said for Kenneth Lonergan's lethargic and very predictable script.

Yes, for the most part, it's a downer. There is a deeper darker tragedy at the center of this already tragic story, the collateral damage from which our main character, Lee Chandler, never recovers. Say what you will about the film's funereal tone but there is nary a false feeling or false sounding moment in the entire 137 minutes...nary, mind you. Though that sad page from Lee's past almost feels TOO tragic as it unspools, it's the resulting interactions of the characters involved - especially between him, his ex-wife Randi, and nephew Patrick - that feel note-for-note authentic. Despite the general malaise, Manchester By the Sea's truthfulness - coming to terms with the turmoil scene by scene as much as humanly possible - ultimately makes for an optimistic experience. Life is often a bummer, which all filmgoers can relate to in spades. The fact that this film's authenticity nearly moves the viewer from sympathy to empathy, however, speaks volumes for its emotional punch. And while it's true that some wish to escape a depressive atmosphere when they step into a cinema, these audience members probably shouldn't have wandered into a drama with a movie poster featuring two sullen people and more oak clusters than the most decorated Army veteran.\n\nLee is a broken man. We know this without dialogue. Casey Affleck has turned in many understated performances where a character fails to deal with some emotional issues (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Gone Baby Gone, The Killer Inside Me), but his turn in Manchester By the Sea takes it a step further. In this very gifted actor's hands, Lee unhealthily shoves down every last feeling such that the internal pain exhibits itself externally and he looks perpetually stooped but coiled, seemingly reticent but ready to strike as soon as someone pushes his buttons. It's an amazing turn worth its weight in Oscar gold more than any other male performance this year. Michele Williams as Randi, meanwhile, meets him beat for beat with a lot less screen time. Both say so much with so little; both performances are truly unforgettable. Without Kenneth Lonergan's masterful screenplay and direction, however, these turns might have very well been rudderless. They chart some rough waters in Manchester but their downbeat experience amazingly gives way to an upbeat outlook thanks to the transparency of all the artists involved. It's a rare film that has you run the gamut of emotions without filmic tricks or manipulation. Here, simply put, reality truly sets in. \n\nTo Sum it Up: Deep but Blue Sea",

            "content": "Manchester by the Sea is a sad sad film with brilliantly understated performances that suck you in before punching you in the gut. This is one of those movies where the synergy of everyone involved in front of and behind the camera is evident.\n\nCasey Affleck plays the depressed, self-isolating Lee Chandler who is forced to deal with new responsibilities. He doesn't have a ton of dialogue but his thoughts and feelings are palpable. Despite what the marketing will have you believe, Michelle Williams has a small role. A small role that will tear out your heart. One scene in particular in the third act is heart breaking and will have you openly weeping.\n\nThe film is entirely from Lee Chandler's point of view. Despite having a crappy job the film quickly establishes him as an intelligent man whom people are drawn too, further emphasizing how self inflicted his isolation is. Flashbacks are peppered throughout giving you insight on the emotional state of the characters. If you pay close attention you can see how every character has changed physically in some way except for Lee (it's sometimes hard to know if it's the past or present if Lee is the only one in frame). Wonderful example of how costume / hair & make up can go a long way to compliment a movie's theme.\n\nAnother tool used to great effect in the film is to intensify or prolonging tension by interrupting the flow of the scene. Almost every scene is deliberately interrupted with believably clumsy dialogue or a character fumbling or struggling with an object. A character will have a rude outburst, forgot where they parked the car, a band member will be off beat or someone might hurt themselves. This creates a very realistic and un-cinematic feel that serves the film very well.\n\nThe only criticism I have is most likely due to the environment in which I watched the film. I was not in the mood for a serious film and I got a little bored for the first half an hour. My suggestion is to make sure you are ready to watch a grounded and emotionally draining drama and bring some tissue paper.",

There is some seriously heavy stuff here, but the film perfectly balances it with just the right amount of humor.  This is a movie that some people may not appreciate due to its subtlety.  The genius of this film lies in what is unsaid.  Everything you need to know is there on-screen, but it's not spelled out for you - it's in the details:  how the characters look (or don't look) at each other, a picture on the wall, a silence between two people.  The film exemplifies a naturalism that is rarely seen in movies these days... it immerses you in a world of real people, in a real place, experiencing real crises and real emotions.  The characters are SO well written, including the best written teenage character I have seen in a movie, maybe ever.  And Casey Affleck is a revelation, he embodied his character so fully, I'd swear it was actually him.  He's got that Best Actor trophy in the bag, no one else can touch him.  The film is peppered with flashbacks that take some getting used to, but they are used brilliantly to slowly unfold the story behind the story... which is really where the meat of this film is.  If I have any complaints, it's that it's a little too long and drags a bit in parts.  But for me, this movie is easily one of the best of the year, if not THE best.",

Not since Doubt has another film with tour de force acting gripped my attention so fiercely and unrelentingly. Using flash backs, the director Lonergan brilliantly filled us audience in on the background of Lee and the tragedy that shaped his character. Casey had the lion share of the 135 minutes movie since the focus was on him. But the supporting cast gave stellar performances such as the beautiful Michelle Williams to treat us to an ensemble performance. It is a long movie but never felt draggy. The director never shot a scene longer than it should which means that the director really packed many many scenes in, making editing work all the more difficult and time consuming. But the end result is a masterpiece. Manchester by the Sea is beautiful and unforgettable and Casey is under radar of many now. But in fairness to Ryan Gosling, its a much more difficult role to play the jazz pianist, the tap dancer and the crooner. Gosling could play Lee, but Affleck will be hopeless playing the jazz pianist. The Oscars, unfortunately, always favour the serious genre over musicals or comedy. So I think the Golden Globes did the right thing of having two separate categories for acting. Comedy/ musicals & serious dramas.",

Lee isolates himself from people, and drinks his sorrows away, not learning that his alcoholism is one reason the tragedy occurred. \n\nLee is forced to have to deal with people when his brother Joe, played by the always excellent Kyle Chandler dies from a long term illness. Joe has left Lee as the Guardian of his teenage son Patrick, played by the standout Lucas Hedges.\n\nThe main story is the relationship between these 2 characters, the wounded, self pitying Lee, and the stronger Patrick. The 2 actors have great chemistry and bring drama and meaning to every scene they share.\n\nThe cast has the exceptional Michelle Williams as Lee's ex wife, but unfortunately she is only in a few scenes, but each scene she is in sears off the screen. \n\nThe Strong cast includes CJ Wilson as a close family friend, that might be the best candidate to be the Guardian. He brings great humanity and caring to his role. Gretchen Mol is fantastic in one scene as Patrick's estranged, newly sober Mom, trying desperately to be a Good Mom, when her only impulse is to drink. Matthew Broderick plays her Born Again husband, and nails the role as an upright, uptight Christian.\n\nThe acting is the Only reason I can recommend this film, because it is one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen. The soundtrack is horrible, and is funeral like music that unwisely tries to evoke sadness, when the viewer doesn't need the musical cue. The story is manipulative, and the script is not strong using flashbacks almost every other scene. I love the cinematography and the location of the story, and the actors all do a good job with the Boston type accent.

Thus, I would argue that the best character studies are generally better than the best of nearly all other genres. Of course, that comes with plenty of personal bias. I have trouble in enduring characters not worth my time learning about. Luckily, director-writer Kenneth Lonergan has created and developed a character who may be all too familiar to us somewhere in our personal lives, yet strangely absent in the realm of cinema. On the surface, Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) may seem like a typical deadbeat father / husband / employee / friend / uncle / general member of society, treating everyone like crap and is forced to face the consequences of his actions. But Lee knows himself well enough, to understand that seeking redemption is futile. He made a grave mistake, and second chances won't prevent him from making the same mistake again. He won't ever forgive himself, even if everyone else does, and will simply do what he can to distract himself for however long he lives. Because he does not forgive himself for *SPOILER* neglecting a fire that ultimately killed all three of his children, he could not ever take the place of his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) as the guardian of Patrick (Lucas Hedges).\n\nI dig negative spaces. With Manchester by the Sea being the second Kenneth Lonergan film I have seen, I hail him as an artisan of the cinematic negative space. We can see connections develop and thoughts transmit through both what is said and what is not said. We fill in the blanks, based on both what is on the screen and what is not on the screen. Not just in one scene, but also in between scenes. That can apply to a whole plethora of directors, so I would also note something unique about Lonergan's style. I would not necessarily call him darkly humoured, but he does let sad jokes also stand as revealing moments for us to better understand the characters. Thus, you are free to laugh off whatever was said or done, or you can spend more time considering whom the person in question is. So, uh, I've seen two-thirds of Lonergan's entire filmography as director and writer, Margaret being the one film I missed. Looks like I am a fan. I'm not sure why Manchester by the Sea got some audience negativity for being slow. Maybe it really is too real for some viewers. Oh, well. Incidentally, I recommend this to anyone with a general appreciation for cinema, not to mention Massachusetts.",

Lee seems to exist outside the superficialities of day to day life. His inability to conform to standards of social etiquette (refusing to engage in small talk and be polite to those he meet) is representative of his indifference to the world around him. As a janitor, he witnesses his clients complaining and discussing the various worries they  are confronted with. Yet Lee remains in his state of indifference. A client confesses their love to him, and he remains emotionless. His relationship with his nephew is built on an unspoken sense of comfortability, and security they feel with one another.

This is an imposition to Lee and he decides to conform Patrick's life and living situation to his own.\n\nWonderful, emotional journey.  A gritty, realistic human drama about tragedy, how one reacts to it, recovering from it (or not) and second starts.\n\nWell written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan.  Particularly impressive is the use of back-and-forth time jumps to feed in background information.  The revelation of the reason for Lee's depression is incredibly powerful and is woven into the plot with a deft touch.\n\nThis non-linearity helps the intrigue and the engagement level.\n\nOn the negative side the conclusion feels a bit tame after all that came before.  I was expecting something quite profound and more closure-oriented but, while there is a degree of closure, it doesn't quite end up as conclusive as I imagined.  This said, life doesn't always work out so neatly, so the ending is fairly realistic.  This movie is about the journey, not the destination.\n\nSuperb performance by Casey Affleck in the lead role, for which he won the 2017 Best Actor Oscar.  Good support from Lucas Hedges (as Patrick), Michelle Williams, Kyle Chandler, CJ Wilson and Gretchen Mol.  Hedges and Williams received Best Supporting Actor/Actress nominations for their performances.  Matthew Broderick also appears in a minor role.",

It's the everyday-ness of his stories, and of the people, that resonate and stay with you. We're immersed in their lives and it's like people you know. \n\nWith each of his films, though, he ratchets up the central tragedy.

Kenneth Lonergan serves you a film where a man filled with issues from his quite recent past get's a bunch of new responsibities thrown over him. He's not ready for it, he knows it, but he really tries his best. Maybe he is actually so up for it that it makes his life better, but he just can't take the shot or maybe he wanna to try it for a while? There are loads of questions here, slowly being aswered. The story moves very neatly. It's sad, deep and touching. It's fresh, still not that original. It got that delicate drama-feel, that makes you feel with the characters, laugh and cry.\n\nCasey Affleck is doing his best effort to date. It's absolutely brilliant. The way his face, bodylanguage and his ways in general acts out is fantastic. There is so much going on in his head that it shows from miles away but I'm glad we are close to him at most scenes. Hand's down, it's one of the strongest performances I've seen lately. Brilliant supporting actors helps and the smart double story line is making it a film with a lot to digest. That way, two ours plus runns by and I never feel it's to easy even if it uses known tricks. A very solid film and a sure shot for fans of realistic films with people in personal crises.\n\n8 out of 10 boat engines.",

And so I had to forcefully endure the monotony for the first few minutes of the movie to get completely immersed in the drama. But once immersed, it became effortlessly easy to see that Casey Affleck is the main source of wonderment. His character, Lee, constantly looks like he's thinking of something terribly stressful. As we see him trudge through his challenges, we wonder what sorts of submerged emotions he is actually experiencing, and whether or not he will explode. We rarely see explicit action that substantiate Lee's thoughts, but through just a handful of short yet powerful scenes, the heart-rending intricacies of the character is strikingly illustrated to maximum effect. Such would not be possible without Affleck's sublime performance.",

Out of all the Academy Award Best Picture nominees, this is the one that I was the least looking forward to only for the fact that I didn't really find it that interesting as drama films tend to get easily boring, but I know that I want to watch all the films that were in that category, so I know that I'll have to watch this, and go my surprise, I really liked it. This is the best performance that I've seen from Casey Affleck as he's depressed in that he feels like he lost everything, but still keeps going with his life. Michelle Williams is not in it that much, but she does put a spark when she's in it, especially in the end where she gave an emotional scene. Lucas Hedges was fine in it, but he doesn't quite have that same weight that Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams has, which when I saw him in the film for the first time, I knew that there was something missing. The writing by Kenneth Lonergan is fantastic in that it's just a piece of life happening, and the way that it shows flashbacks is quite subtle that I honestly forgot I was watching a flashback. The characters felt like actual human people, which is quite an accomplishment to do, and I was actually invested in this as the pacing in this is very slow and is entirely a drama film, with some surprisingly comedic moments that are effective. I'm surprised that with this being more than 2 hours long and the pacing going in a snail pace, I wasn't bored of it, nor was it dragging either, except in some rare moments, but there's not much of it. Manchester by the Sea is a really great film that I'm glad it got some awards out of the actors and the director.",

When his brother dies, he's put in an awkward situation when he finds out his brother wanted him to be guardian for his teenage nephew. Given he's never really dealt with his own grief and guilt from a tragedy that happened in his past, that seems impossible to him. He manages to arrange his brother's services somehow, but dealing with his nephew isn't something he's prepared for. He has flashbacks to years ago often in this movie and you don't always know the flashback is starting or ending. The musical soundtrack is too loud, as if make up up for the relative lack of enough meaningful dialogue in the movie. Lee and the nephew talk, but not enough to truly bridge the gap.Dealing with deep feelings isn't something Lee does well, so don't expect much of the ending...it doesn't get better in this movie. Good acting, I guess, in a repressed sort of way. But itt wasn't a story I would have chosen to watch if I had known what it was like..",

Walking in the wrong direction to the car, the ambulance trolley that wouldn't function properly, the phone that cuts out... all these during tragic circumstances is exactly what happens to us all.

At its worst, it consistently avoids interesting secondary characters in favour of meandering moodiness, which slowly stagnates and quickly starts to stink.",

This is one of the best drama films I have seen for quite sometime, the gut punch narrative confuses and rewards the viewer. Affleck enters the lead role category with this powerful performance and while the supporting cast is also top notch they can't steal the limelight from him. This beautiful film deserved the critical awards and it is easily one of the best films of 2016. 05-07-2017.",

Not since the film The Artist, has the central character been so compelling in his role. In an era when so much focus is on women warriors, unrealistic CGI based films and violent anti-heroes, it is nice to see a strong realistic life altering story. I just wish Hollywood would take note and stop making politically correct, female warrior, unrealistic CGI garbage. Reviewers who panned this film are usually the same one who panned brilliant films such as Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy because they're impatient thrill seeking millenials who grew up playing video games and prefer the instant sugar rush of a derivative CGI film over a substantive story that unfolds like a great novel.",
