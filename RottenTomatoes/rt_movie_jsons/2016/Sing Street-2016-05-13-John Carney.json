A despairing movie about being a teenager in love, fighting systemic religious and social pressures, the importance of friendship, family and love. With a beautiful, happy ending. An incredibly moving present all wrapped up in a perfect bow. People who don't like this don't have taste.",

            "content": "For Brothers Everywhere.\n\nFirst and foremost, the music in this movie is genius (and quirky). I have been listening to the album on repeat after finishing this movie a week ago. Sing Street is perfectly described by using Raphina's words: \"happy-sad\". I cried a bit, smiled a lot and enjoyed every minute, even the painful ones.\n\nThough a love story on paper, the purest relationship is between the brothers. The respect they have for each other and how they comfort one another is one of the best parts of the film. All culminating in a beautiful finale, the love the brothers have for each other is palpable.\n\nSome of the characters were underdeveloped and storylines were buttoned up too quickly, but the movie hits all the feels. We are meant to create and grow, and Sing Street illustrates that message beautifully. This is one of those movies that gets better after each viewing.\n\nBest Character: Brendan\nBest Scene: Writing \"Up\"\nBest Quote: \"Will you help me right a song?\" - Conor. \"Always.\" - Eamon.\nBest Song: \"Drive It Like You Stole It\"",

I am a fan of movies about music, not musicals, but films about bands/musicians (Whiplash, La Bamba, The Doors, Walk the Line, etc.) This one nails it on every level: Great story, great music, likeable characters and good humor. I watched it for the third time the other night with my girlfriend and it still shines bright. Highly recommended",

Conor Loler is the main character in the plot he attends a new school where he is presented with fighting shouting and a uncontrolled school system he makes friends and forms a band and he meets the girl of his life. The plot starts when he attends the school, he is presented with fighting pushing bullying and more he experiences this when somebody makes him dance in a room a bully known as \"cool guy\".  He then meets his new ginger friend who had also experienced it and decided to form a band, He met friends who played instruments and helped with the band, He gets a girl for his music video who he falls in love with and they become a great band together.\n\nThere are many good things about the film the character development the family' and how every character has a certain personality, Mr. Stricklin character is seen as a bully and everyone is scared of him even when he appearance he Is the only one of the staff that the students would listen to he sees all the fighting when they think he is not looking but does not take action, His character really helped develop Conor as a character he made him form a band because he was scare and motivated and that set the course of the movie, His family are struggling financially and the family never really could start a band but when condor attended the school it motivated him to, His brother was very motivated also but when he was born he was very jealous and his career fell from there.\n\nOverall them movie is good it has a good character development a good plot a good setting and really sets the moment of 1990 I would recommend this to all ages I think, especially people who like romantic comedy movies and music.\n\nStar rating overall, I would give 2 stars as I'm not into romantic movies but I think if I was it would be an enjoyable movie, I did like the \"comedy\" but overall, it wasn't enjoyable for",

Debido a esto, debe de cambiar de escuela, en donde conoce a Raphina y a otras personas.\nEscuche muchas cosas buenas sobre esta película, y al ver que estaba disponible en netflix no dude en ver qué tal estaba, y es muy buena. John Carney nos da muy buenos personajes como Raphina (Lucy Boynton) , Conor(Ferdia Walsh- Peelo) y Brendan (Jack Reynor ). Lucy Boynton era a la única a la que ubica por Bohemian Rhapsody en la que hace un buen trabajo, pero aquí muestra todo su potencial. Ferdia Walsh- Peelo y Jack Reynor también hacen un gran trabajo, y tienen mucha química como hermanos, Brendan es la \"figura paterna\" de Conor, es el que lo ayuda, el que escucha sus problemas, el que lo aconseja y por eso es que me gusto mucho su personaje y eso en gran parte es por el trabajo de Jack, al principio parecía que sería el típico estereotipo de hermano bully, pero no. De lo que más destaca esta película es por la música, es bastante buena y ayuda mucho a que la película se sienta ligera y amena. La dirección de John Carney es muy buena, combina el drama y la comedia perfectamente y al igual que la música. Los vestuarios son buenos, son llamativos al igual que el maquillaje. Mi única queja sobre esta película es qué hay algunos personajes que no aportan nada a la trama, solo están ahí porque necesitan a gente para su banda, y lo único que hacen es tocar, tienen muy poca participación. Sing street es una gran película por sus personajes con los que te puedes relacionar, por su gran música y por su historia, definitivamente recomendaría esta película.",

It isn't doing anything new and you can predict every plot twist.  But the characters are likable, and their exuberance is contagious.  Set in Ireland, in 1985, it nails the music and style of the time period.  Cosmo (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) is a 15-year old boy dealing with family fall out and the recessive economic period in Irish history.  Along comes a muse, in the form of wanna-be model Raphina (Lucy Boynton).  Together with a rag-tag group of kids, they create a possible escape from it all, with music in the lead.  Supporting actor Jack Reynor delivers a crucial assist with a stellar performance as Brendan, Cosmo's brother born into missed opportunity.  With youthful enthusiasm, young love, and a brotherly hand, almost anything seems possible. ",
