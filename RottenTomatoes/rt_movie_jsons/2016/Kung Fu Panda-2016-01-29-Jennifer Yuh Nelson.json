Aqui eu sinto que as piadas são só para o publico infantil mesmo. Novamente falando, algumas são boas, mas no geral não são lá muito boas. O vilão, Kai, não é tão interessante a unica coisa boa mesmo é sua trilha sonora. Na real, é que Kung Fu Panda sempre acerta nas trilhas sonoras e aqui não foi diferente. No fim, é um filme que da pra se divertir com a família, uma animação muito bonita e bem feita e o filme mais infantil da saga do nossa amado Panda.",

            "content": "Regular película, sin dudas la mas floja de la trilogía por mucho, no se como bajaron tanto el nivel. Para empezar, el humor es muy absurdo y forzado, en todo momento tratan de meter algún chiste haciendo que algunas escenas no se tomen en serio, dejándolas completamente infantiles y nada emotivas. No me gusta para nada que haya una involución en los personajes, por ejemplo Po vuelve a ser el inexperto de la primera cinta, solo que acá es más tonto y menos consciente de lo que ocurre en la mayoría de los acontecimientos; esto mismo pasa con otros personajes secundarios. Es una lastima que Shifu y los 5 Furiosos acá solo están en segundo plano, no aportan prácticamente nada en casi toda la película, y sus participaciones son ligeramente reducidas, siendo opacadas principalmente por Po y toda la aldea de pandas, una manada de personajes que solo están ahí aportando chistes sin gracia. El villano no me gusto nada, su trama deja huecos argumentales y ni siquiera tiene conexión con el protagonista, simplemente Kai es malo y quiere matarlo, no hay una verdadera conexión, cosa que si lo hubo con Tai Lung y con Shen. Después, hay cosas sin sentido alguno, como que Po podía hacerse el skadoosh a él mismo, cosa de la que nunca se demostró o se habló de ello en la primera o en la segunda; además, los pandas son capaces de darle chi a Po por como se les dé la gana, como por ejemplo al decir bebe con rayas les funciona, cualquier cosa la verdad. En conclusión, es una lastima como arruinaron lo que podría haber sido una trilogía perfecta con esta película, tenia mucho potencial y presentaron una trama muy ilógica y conveniente, y con un humor tonto y forzado. La recomiendo solo porque es el final de la trilogía.",

            "content": "My issues with this movie comes down to one key issue: its relation to the first two movies in the trilogy.  This shows through in a number of ways: largely the story and the drastic change in tone.\n\nThe story of the first two movies has Po out of his depth, coming to terms with a facet of himself through great effort and struggle.  In the first, he must come to terms with the responsibility he always dreamed of having, and the consequences should he fail to live up to that responsibility.  He goes through a crucible, realizing that every single one of his heroes despises him, and what he represents, then realizing he is expected to defend the valley from the greatest threat it has ever faced.  In the second movie, Po must face the man who killed his parents and led a genocide of his people, orphaning him and making him the last of his species.  Lord Shen is certain that he killed every single panda.  Po must come to terms with his past, and in doing so saves all of China from a despot.  \nThe third movie starts by completely subverting the plot of the second.  The pandas survived!  The reason the second movie exists, and Po's struggle therein, is now far less meaningful.  And Po's struggle in the third movie is less interesting and less meaningful than those previous.  He's told he's now a teacher, and worries that he isn't able to do his job well.  The stakes are far lower, and the emotional impact is similarly reduced.  If he can't teach well, then his friends training will suffer until he figures it out.  Then, upon arriving in the Panda village, Po just... figures out how to teach.  He didn't go through anything in an attempt to figure out how to teach, he just magically got better.  \nThe other side of the story, in which Po finds his family while dealing with Kai, is similarly bland.  His father, who we've never met and have no reason to care about beyond a single line in the second movie and the expectation that 'if he's Po's father, then we have to care about him', is introduced and immediately we're struck with the expectation that the character deserves the audience's attention and emotional connection.  The writers didn't let Ping feel replaced, they didn't let Po wonder why he'd lived without his people for his entire life, and they expected an emotional connection to exist in a vacuum.  \nAs far as antagonists go, Tai Lung was amazing and Lord Shen impeccable.  Kai threatens far less than his predecessors: Tai Lung threatened the entire Valley, and beyond.  Shen threatened all of China.  Kai threatened a few dozen characters, less than 10 of which we actually know.  Kai doesn't connect to Po's inner struggle at all in the same way that Tai Lung and Shen did.  And Kai's attitude throughout is far less distinctive than his predecessors.  \nThe humor and campiness of this third installment were also grating, especially after the wonderful physical humor and genuinely intense mood that the first two movies attained at critical points.  Meanwhile, the final fights here are interspersed with random panda villagers doing one move, then celebrating, or Po just grandstanding, instead of genuinely reaching out to his enemies as he did in the first two movies.  That said, these are far more apparent than the issues above, which took me a while to put to words.  I'm far happier just watching the first two movies and considering that the end of the series.",

            "content": "I had to think really hard about my thoughts for this movie. I hold the Kung Fu Panda franchise very close to my heart. I have invested a lot of my time in not just the movies, but as well as the side series. Overall, I think this is a great movie, it just left me feeling very underwhelmed. It still has all of the great elements from the first two films. The animation, the action, and the deep themes are all present in the third installment of this franchise. The new style of Kung Fu that is introduced, chi, was a pretty good addition. Also, I liked how they were able to reintroduce Oogway into the storyline. And of course...you have Po, who is still the lovable and funny lead protagonist we all love. All of these aspects are the reason why I love this franchise so much. However, I still feel that there was a lot of missed potential here and somethings that simply weren't going to work for me. Kai as the villain was fine for me, but he felt much more generic compared to the villains from the previous films. I didn't like how Shifu and the Furious Five were off in the distance for this film (though their minimal amount of screen time is pretty awesome). But my biggest issue with the film is the other pandas (more specifically Li (Po's father) and Mei Mei). The other pandas make the film feel a lot more childish, and I didn't find any of their interactions with Po to be that funny. This was something I expected though, so I wasn't as bothered at that. After, the primary audience for most of the DreamWorks films is younger children. But there were two new characters that I believe were the epitome of wasted potential. First of all their is Po's biological father Li. Considering how the two of them reuniting was the main plot of the story, it seemed like a great continuation of the storyline. But most of their interactions with each other are meant to be for jokes, and when the creators tried to make some emotional moments with them, it felt sort of disingenuine. And then you've got Mei Mei. This flirtatious Panda was the most disappointing part of this film for me because I had such high hopes for her. Giving Po a girlfriend would have been a genius move on their part as it could really help shape his arc as the Dragon Warrior. Her one good interaction with Po is their first one, where she's flirting with Po, but making it seem like he flirting with her. And that's it. That is literally all that she does. She learns how to use nunchucks...and...um...she...uh...yeah that's about it. It might seem like I am being hard on this movie and I am. But it is simply because I know the potential that these movies have. That with another sequel in the works, DreamWorks could give us a franchise that could surpass How to Train Your Dragon. They didn't utilize certain plot points that would have made this movie so much better.  If this were the last movie, I definitely would have disliked it much more, but maybe they can make amends in future installments. As nitpicky as I am, I think that this still a great family film that I recommend. Just make sure you watch the first two movies first.",

It not only paints blood fathers in a good light, something I wish I could really relate to on a personal level, but adopted fathers in a good light, both at the same time, something I never thought I'd see especially from Dreamworks.\n\nThe story is that Po enters the long hidden panda village and re-unites with his biological father and the other pandas, but problems arise when a villainous spirit warrior, named Kai, returns to the living realm and proceeds to steal chi from the kung fu masters. Along the way Po continues to bond with his father and the other pandas within the village. All the while secrets are unfortunately discovered and his friends, the furious five, have had their chi taken as well. To prevent Kai from taking chi from all other kung fu masters and pandas, Po forms the army of pandas, alongside Tigress and his adoptive father, to battle Kai's jade minions and Po must become a master of chi to defeat him and save those of the living realm.\n\nThis was a film I was absolutely wanting for the longest time after the cliffhanger ending of Kung Fu Panda 2 which is still my personal favorite of the three movies, but this one is still pretty good. Like I mentioned earlier, this is one of the few movies I've seen that actually manages to paint a mostly positive and relatable relationship between not just Po and his two different dads, but the dads actually coming to an understanding and accepting each other both as part of Po's life. Try to think of any other movie and/or show that can not only do that, but do it in a way that's funny, charming, and respectable. This is also one of the few animated films I've seen that actually does a liar revealed that doesn't feel overly cliched and drawn out, if anything else, not only was I actually was kind of surprised when it happened the first time I saw the movie, but you completely understand the reasoning behind it and the reasoning behind the affect it has when it does happen. I won't give away what it is specifically for those who haven't seen it, but let's just say, it was surprisingly well done.\n\nAs for the other things, the animation is still really gorgeous. The action, while not as fast and impressive as the last two, is more portraid in a larger spectacle especially in the spirit realm which feels a lot like a beautiful chinese painting brought to life in the best of ways. The blend of comedy and drama from the previous two return and are, for the most part, just as well done here. The only two problems I have with this film is that the formula of these movies does start to really become aparent in this and, while I do like this movie a lot, I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the basic formula in this from time to time. And the villain, while he does get some good laughs and still does have a decent backstory, just isn't nearly as memorable as the villain in the last film despite both having a great design and having J.K Simmons hamming it up at times.\n\nOverall, while the film is far from perfect, if you want the best kind of movie to make you and your dad feel special this father's day, this is the perfect film to do that with.\n\n",

Kung Fu Panda 3 on the other hand, like I said, has everything that made the first movie awesome. Tai Lung and Shen were great villains, but Kai just might actually take the cake and be the best one out of the three. He's more threatening than the other two, more cocky, and has several other qualities that make him a better villain than Tai Lung and Shen. Another thing that the third installment does very good is borrowing elements from the second movie. Kung Fu Panda 2, while very funny, had some pretty sad and emotional scenes, and Kung Fu Panda 3 is no stranger to that. I find that to be a very interesting touch, and was quite surprised that it did this. Overall, this is another installment to this awesome franchise that nobody should miss out on. 9 out of 10.

            "content": "Kung Fu Panda 3 meets the minimum requirements in what fans of the first two films would expect: jokes about weight, Po's still struggling with handling Kung Fu (even though he became the \"dragon warrior\" at the end of the first film) and questions of how to determine what true family is. Sadly, the film itself lazily meets these expectations without providing much else for its fan base.\n\nWe start with an uninteresting villain played by J.K. Simmons. He is an associate of Master Oogway, and that is how he is known (this joke gets really old really fast within the film itself). He manages to escape the spirit realm (this universe's equivalent of the afterlife) and is determined to take over the spirits of kung fu masters because.... well who cares? The film simply establishes he is a bad guy who wants revenge and to have control over the real world - you know, your typical one-dimensional children's movie villain.\n\nPo's father, played by Bryan Cranston, finds him at the start of the film, which is really convenient because pandas are supposed to know about something called \"chi\" which is what the villain is after. Pandas were known to heal Oogway with this power in the past, and it is of course the only way to stop Simmons' character. This subplot eventually clears up what we did not know about the pandas in this universe, and of course the film goes to great lengths to make comedy out of how lazy pandas turn out to be.\n\nThe jokes used in this film are just rehashed jokes from the first two films, not providing great comedy as its predecessors since it proves to be unoriginal. Kung Fu Panda 3 is still enjoyable, but its strength lies on the theme of questionable identity posed by the two competing fathers of the film: Mr. Ping and Li. This is only touched on a few times throughout the film, but when it is touched on it brings up interesting questions about whether Po would need nature or nurture: that is, does he need his biological father or the one who raised him. These moments are the only ones of great intrigue within the film.\n\nThere is also a return to a cop-out fighting technique from the first film that makes the conflict of the story less difficult for Po to get through. While the film has the same spirit of its predecessors, Kung Fu Panda 3 is not a very fun film, but it is not terrible. In  the Chinese Spirit Realm, Grand Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) fights against the spirit warrior and collector Kai (J. K. Simmons) and has his chi stolen, but not before he warns Kai that Po (Jack Black), the Dragon Warrior, will stop him. Kai disregards this and returns to the mortal world. Meanwhile, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) announces his retirement and passes the role of teacher to Po. He discovers that teaching kung fu is hard, as the Furious Five members Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Monkey (Jackie Chan) are injured as a result. Po is demoralized as a teacher, but is advised by Master Shifu to be himself.\n\nPo heads home to his adoptive father Mr. Ping (James Hong) at his noodle shop where a panda named Li Shan (Bryan Cranston) breaks Po's dumpling-eating record. They both soon learn that Li is Po's biological father and they bond with each other much to Ping's jealousy. After introducing Li to Shifu and his friends, the Valley of Peace is suddenly attacked by past Kung Fu Masters turned into jade statues under the control of Kai. The team then learn through research that Kai was Grand Master Oogway's old friend who fought with him long ago, but was banished to the spirit realm for 500 years when he grew thirsty for the power of chi. Kai can only be defeated by a master of true chi, which they discover was an innate ability of the panda colonies. Po, at Li's suggestion, along with Mr. Ping, travels to the secret village where the pandas hide while Shifu and the Furious Five stay behind to investigate Kai's movements and defend the Palace. Although Po is eager to learn chi, he first learns the life of a panda in the village, which he feels grateful to be a part of.\n\nAfter learning that all the Kung Fu masters are missing, Master Shifu sends Crane and Mantis to find them. Crane and Mantis join with other Kung Fu masters to confront Kai, but they all have their chi stolen. Kai then arrives at the Jade Palace and destroys it, then takes everybody's chi while Tigress escaped to find Po and warns him of the upcoming danger. Afraid, Li and the pandas prepare to run away. When Po demands that his father teaches him chi, he reveals that they had all forgotten chi, and he only wanted to save Po from Kai's wrath. Hurt over his father's misdirection, Po isolates himself and trains vigorously to confront Kai. Mr. Ping then comforts Li and admits he was initially worried Po would be taken away from him, but came to realize that Li being a part of Po's life simply added to his happiness, and that they should stay by Po's side as family.\n\nTigress confronts Po and tells him that he cannot defeat Kai without continuing to discover the secret of chi, during which Po confesses that the experience has him once more doubting his potential. Li and the villagers, having decided to stay, ask Po to train them so they can fight back. Po agrees and teaches them using their everyday activities as their assets and begins their plan to save their village. Kai arrives and sends his minions to capture Po, but they are held off by the pandas and Tigress, distracting Kai. The plan works, but ultimately fails when Po tries to use the Wuxi Finger hold on Kai, who reveals that it won't work on spirits. Kai gains the upper hand in their fight, but in a last-ditch effort, Po uses the Wuxi Finger Hold on himself while grabbing onto Kai, sending them both to the spirit realm. They fight again, but Kai defeats Po and prepares to steal his chi. Using what they learned from Po and about who they are, Li, Tigress, Mr. Ping and the pandas are able to use their chi to save him. Po, with the chi flow, suddenly generates a golden dragon-shaped avatar around him and destroys Kai by overloading him with his chi, freeing all of the Kung Fu masters in the process.\n\nIn an ethereal golden pond, Grand Master Oogway appears to Po, and informs him his journey has come full circle, revealing his role by selecting Po as Dragon Warrior is also because of his descent from the ancient pandas, and his embodiment of the yin-yang. He also reveals his role in alerting Li of Po's survival, and expresses his happiness to Po about how much he has grown. By choice, Po wields a mystic green staff bestowed by Oogway to return to the mortal world. Everyone returns to the Jade Palace, where Po proudly gazes upon his family, friends, and legacy in the spot where his journey began.",
