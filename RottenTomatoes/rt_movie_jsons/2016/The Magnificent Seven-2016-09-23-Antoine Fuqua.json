The US Western remake with Yul Brynner is a classic.  It is so much a classic, it is almost untouchable as a film, so a remake was very ambitious.   With that as a standard it was hard to succeed; however this is an admirable try and a very good western.   Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'onofrio do a good job of bringing quirky, skilled western characters to life in, essentially the same story as the US original.   Anton Fuqua's direction and cinematography are good.   The fights and gun play are really good.   The dialogue and laughs are there.   The heart of this is the characters and their interplay.   If you like Westerns-this is especially good.",

However, there was the ocassional cliched accent which I didn't like too much but otherwise, its a good tense watch. I thought Ethan Hawke seemed well suited to his role as a cowboy, for one thing.\n\nSome of the plot details were perhaps slightly simplistic but that aside I very much enjoyed it. Would I recommend it? yes I would - its not perfect but its pretty decent. Also, I haven't seen the original film, so I can't comment on it in terms of it being a remake.",

And in any case, improvement there was none. Denzel Washington couldn't save it, I don't think he even saved himself. Chris Pratt had nothing to play with, Ethan Hawke even less.\n\nThis film should never have been made, the only two worthwhile performances in the entire disaster were by Peter Sarsgaard (the bad guy), and \nVincent D'Onofrio, who found an interesting angle as a god-fearing mountain-man (hence the extra half star).\n\nGo watch the Yul Bryner western original from 1960, and the 7 Samurai classic from 1954, and then perhaps you will join me in weeping for the depths to which film-making have sunk.",

The 2016 version is no different, joining Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke and more into a septet of outlaws, rustlers and bad hombres unified to face an army of hired guns lead by the evil mustache twirling Bartholomew Bogue played by Peter Sarsgaard.\n\nI love a good western and ensemble films are among my favorite. The western genre is no stranger to these types of ensemble films and the original Magnificent Seven is one of the biggest and best examples of the genre. This version of the Akira Kurosawa inspired film mixes action, drama and no small amount of comedy together to make a very enjoyable film. Denzel Washington brings the intensity and Chris Pratt comes loaded up with charm and wit. The supporting cast including Ethan Hawke, Haley Bennett and Vincent D'Onofiro, who's character is a standout, really do well in rounding out the cast. The movie does a good job of keeping all the action clear yet intense making the viewer feel as if they are standing in the middle of the fights. The movie does have a little bit of a struggle with tone in that there are an equal amount of funny moments to dramatic ones to where by the end of the movie I was having a little trouble finding emotional resonance. However, that may also be due to the fact that there are an awful lot of characters here and getting a feel for all of them while maintaining the tone is a tough trick. That aside, I was never bored or confused watching it and it ended up being a fun time at the theater. I would definitely recommend it to someone one looking for some action and especially to the western fan. The Magnificent Seven gets a 3.5...out of 5.",

The seven main actors all bring their A-game and have a good sense of camaraderie with each other. The Magnificent Seven all have their own interesting personalities that in some ways, are even superior to the team led by Yul Brynner. The action sequences are exciting, though the beginning of the climax definitely brought to mind Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The late James Horner did a good job giving Elmer Bernstein's iconic score a 21st-century update. And finally, the cinematography. Wow, there are some really great wide shots. This is a very well-shot movie. This remake-of-a-remake isn't perfect but it does remain simultaneously faithful and different enough to be able to both stand on its own and be on par with the 1960 film.",

And ever even HEARD of the original film.  There are lots of cliches and characters that are shallowly drawn.  Like the first part of the film is like a heist film - 'it's dangerous!'  'I'm in for no apparent reason other than I like throwing my life away'.  Oh and by the way, it is 2016, so we are gonna get one of each diversity.  They missed middle-Eastern, but gosh darn it, they tried real durn hard.  At least the film played it straight-faced and didn't try to 'message up' the movie.",

The 'good guys' are ethnically and racially balanced -- like the backdrop for a political candidate's rally. Still, the old 'good triumphs over bad' theme and revenge always resonate with me -- wish I could get past that. And yes, the story is improbable -- poor homesteaders coming to a moral but lethal bounty hunter with meager cash and having him in turn round up 6 other lethal fighters willing to work for free is improbable.

            "content": "You know, I hate to say that I'm unfamiliar with the original Magnificent Seven.  I don't hate it for the reasons that you'd think, which that the Magnificent Seven is regarded as a top-notch western.  No, the reason I hate to say that I'm unfamiliar with it is simple and that is because the original movie is a remake of what is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, as well as Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, and that is, of course, Seven Samurai.  Here's the thing about Seven Samurai, I have the Criterion Collection special edition DVD (which is something like four discs), on a shelf right now.  In fact, if I look up to my left, I can see it at the bottom of the shelf, with several other DVDs on top of it.  I, sadly, have not yet seen Seven Samurai and I've had this DVD for a while too.  I know, I know, I'm a bad movie nerd.  I'm thinking of, maybe, popping in the DVD tonight and trying to get through it because, as long as it is, I doubt I'll get through it in one sitting.  I was thinking of watching The Chernobyl Diaries tonight, for one reason or another, I guess we'll see which movie I watch when I get to tomorrow's review.  I mean, I'll know before you do, one way or another, I'm just trying to build the suspense for my loyal readers (ha!).  Unless I put it to a Twitter poll that nobody will vote on, who knows?  Regardless, if I had seen Seven Samurai I'd be, roughly, familiar with this and the original, so that's my bad and something that, if not tonight, I hope to rectify by the end of the year.  That's neither here nor there, of course.  For the longest time, though, I used to never really enjoy westerns that much.  Not that I didn't enjoy them, just that the whole machismo, testosterone-driven affairs didn't really do much for me.  Some people revere John Wayne as a western legend and, to be sure, he is, but he was a terrible actor who took this way too seriously.  Not to mention a racist, but, naturally, being an awful human being has nothing to do with his performances on-screen.  But, as I've gotten older, I've come to appreciate a good western more than I probably would have before.  Not saying that this is my favorite film genre, because it's not even close, just that I'm more open to enjoy them than I would have before.  And, honestly, there's genre out there that's more about the battles between good and evil than a good western.  Now, of course, I'm certain there were a lot of old westerns that took a more realistic approach, where it's shades of grey and not black and white.  But a lot of these movies took a black and white approach to the genre and its characters.  And this movie, honestly, might be one of them.  You know who the heroes are and you know who the villains are and never the twain shall meet.  That's perfectly fine, even if it's a little antiquated.  Having said all of that, what'd I think about this movie?  If I'm being honest, I certainly thought that while this film had its flaws, by and large, it's quite an entertaining western.  I suppose I should start out with the positives.  Well, obviously, no review of this movie will be complete without mentioning the star-studded cast.  Well, really, the only major stars here are Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke.  Regardless, the casting for this movie is excellent all around and everyone plays their part tremendously well.  On the other side of that, however, is the fact that there's actually very little character development done within the seven mercenaries hired by this town to get rid of this industrialist, Bartholomew Bogue (a great, villainous name), who's trying to force them out of their land with the help of his Blackstone agents, who kill several of the homesteaders to prove their point.  Bogue is like Donald Trump, except Bogue's not as evil.  Anyway, while the characters are likable and, at the very least, memorable, there's not really much work done with them to make you care for them in anything more than a superficial way.  Goodnight Robicheaux has this PTSD  (he was a confederate soldier) and he's had enough of the killing and the fighting.  Chisolm had his mother raped/murdered and his sisters were murdered by Blackstone agents before they attempted to kill him.  In terms of Chisolm, though, this is all revealed in the climax of the movie, as he's choking Bogue in the church.  Emma wants to avenge her husband's death.  I don't know if I'm forgetting anyone else's 'arc', but that's just the major stuff that comes to mind.  I guess in terms of which arc I liked the best, it'd have to be Robicheaux's since it leads to the predictable moment of him coming to the rescue, predictably, at the last minute after originally having left before the battle began.  But, once again, they don't really do much with any of these characters and the stories they might have had to tell.  I understand that Chisolm was meant to be this calm and cool character, always composed, but I would have loved to know more about his backstory.  What led him to where he is at the start of the movie.  Because of that, in my opinion, the movie suffers.  While the movie is certainly never dull, I feel like there's a big chunk of the movie, prior to the Battle for Rose Creek, where the movie just stands still.  And I guess that's the nature of the beast, the calm before the storm if you will.  But I just felt that if the movie had been cut down, it would have helped with the pacing.  They spend a while trying to train the people of Rose Creek for battle and, honestly, it just never seemed to go anywhere.  I get that they needed to do this, since you can't just have them, all of a sudden, be experts with firearms.  And, even with the training, they're not great with the firearms to begin with.  So, while I understand, I feel that a bit too much time is taken with this.  Ultimately, everyone in Rose Creek not named Emma or Teddy Q don't really matter.  Rose Creek and its people are nothing but a plot device, something for these seven to fight for.  They're not REAL people.  Though, to be fair, if the movie didn't really do much with its protagonists, I don't think anyone could have reasonably expected them to do much with the people of Rose Creek.  They do a decent job at making it feel like a tight-knit community, but you still don't care about them that much.  Again, they're just there to give these men something to fight for.  But, in spite of all its flaws, the movie more than makes up for it with its gunfights and, particularly, the Battle for Rose Creek is quite excellent in its choreography, chaos and gunfights.  It's not like it'll revolutionize how people put together action sequences in westerns, but it is a top-notch scene regardless.  Pretty lengthy too.  The whole thing, starting from the Bogue's men arrive in the outskirts of the town until Bogue's death, it goes close to 30 minutes and it's never once boring.  Regardless of how many films have pulled off extended action sequences throughout the years, Marvel as an example has done this throughout the years with their MCU, it never fails to impress how these sequences are pulled off.  And that's the case here as well and, for the most part, it's all practical, which makes this even more impressive.  There is one scene where they use CG and it's not great.  After everything is over, Emma, in a voiceover, remembers the seven fondly and thanks them for their noble sacrifice.  Well, you get to see the wooden crosses for the graves of the four (of the seven) that died with Rose Creek in the background and it's like a cheap wallpaper for your laptop.  It's not terrible, but it's not good.  It just brings to mind the question as to what would we be the point of doing this with CG???  Is it really that expensive to do this, you know, practically???  It's not like Rose Creek was shot on a Hollywood set, it was shot on-location.  So what would be the problem with doing this final shot on-location.  It's a lame last shot, to be honest.  But, regardless, it doesn't change much, it was just a strange choice to do that bit with CG.  Anyway, as I mentioned, I have my issues with this movie in terms of its character development, but the strong casting, likable characters and the excellent action still add up to make this a good movie.  It's probably not gonna be as widely remembered as the original nor as the movie that inspired it, but it's still a solid and enjoyable movie.  Wouldn't say you need to go out of your way to see this, but if you've got Prime and want yourself a good western, this will do the trick.",

Behind the camera, director Antoine Fuqua crafts a fun film with plenty of excellent action scenes, but doesn't give the characters much time to develop, unlike it's superior predecessor & the classic, \"Seven Samurai\".  Plus, the villain played by Peter Sarsgaard is evil to the point of being cartoonish, and you never get a feel for his henchmen.

So you might as well settle for this remake.\nThis is one of those remakes nobody asked for, but you know it's gonna be somewhat special if it's led by Denzel Washington, one of the greatest movie stars of our time, a man with not often rivalled charisma and onscreen presence.\nIt's about seven gunmen protecting a town from ruthless robber baron, simple as that. The story or screenplay are nothing special nor especially deep, but they don't even have to be, because the cast is cool and most of the time is dedicated to blasting off those guns.\nThe direction is competent, able to use the best of western cliches and build constant suspense; dialogue is adequate; the acting is good enough but there's no point of writing about all that extensively. First and foremost, this is about shooting people, or preparing to do it, for 132 minutes.\nAlthought the story is shallow, there is some hidden symbolism which may offer some delight for Jung fans.\nThe seven heroes are played by Byung-hun Lee, Chris Pratt, Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier, and Vincent D'Onofrio. The robber baron is Peter Sarsgaard. Also appearing, Luke Grimes, Haley Bennett, et al.\nMost of the cast plays it straight but some (Hawke, D'Onofrio, Sarsgaard) add a little mental instability to their performances, which brings a welcome variety.\nFor a movie directed by Antoine Fuqua, The Magnificent Seven\" is unusually modest and low-key - if you can call a story of massacre that.\nIt never tries to get glamorous and impress us with visual inventiveness, the latter is mostly reserved for shootouts so we wouldn't have to watch men dying in same way over and over again.\nThen again, the world looks remarkably simple and unglamorous as the true wild west may hav been, Washington, for example, hasn't looked that ordinary on screen for a long time.\nSo, this is a simple story well told. Fine entertainment for action lovers, or those who want to see classic western redone with modern tools and resources.",

For me what Magnificent 7 lacked was much to make it magnificent. Character backstory was light with fairly thin context to motivate our heroes and drive the plot. I suspect this is simply a symptom of the genre, but in 2017 the average filmgoer expects a bit more than enigmatic saviours who both metaphorically and in this case literally ride off into the sunset. Fuqua does balance some of the script's inadequacies with a superb cast with Washington and Pratt in particular naturally deepening their roles with their trademark gravitas and charisma. Enjoyable but I won't be jumping back in the saddle for another Western anytime soon.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, I missed  The Magnificent  prequels - one through six. Can you fill me in before we review The Magnificent Seven?\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, just read The Joy of Six and you ll be fully up to speed. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: The 1870s town of Rose Creek has a problem: it s been overrun by robber baron Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard). He has enslaved many of the townsmen as miners for his gold mine. He has no problem killing anyone who gets in his way. When he burns down the church and kills Emma Cullen s (Haley Bennett) husband in cold blood, she goes in search of someone who can stand up to Bogue, and get her revenge.\n\nSCOTT: Enter warrant officer and bounty hunter Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington). Emma meets Chisolm and asks him to take back the town of Rose Creek. At first, Chisolm declines, but changes his mind when he hears it is Bogue who rules the town. Chisolm realizes he needs a team, so he recruits bad-boy Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt), sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), knife guru Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee), tracker Jack Horne (Vincent DOnofrio), Comanche tribesman Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier), and Texican outlaw Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo).\n\nGREG: Scott, depending on how you count, this is the third incarnation of this film. The original was Kurosawas The Seven Samurai from 1954. It recounts a village overrun by mean guys with swords and the recruitment of seven estranged samurai to save the town. Six years later, John Sturges reimagined the story as an American western with Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, and Charles Bronson in the saddles. This new incarnation has the same basic plot, but with a modern cast. I think this version works quite well. Denzel is as great as ever. He s cool and collected and stands toe-to-toe with any bad guy. Chris Pratt offers the comedic relief - playing the same role he plays in all his films, especially since his break-out role in Guardians of the Galaxy. He s witty, snarky, and disarmingly charming. The cast is more multicultural than the earlier incarnations bringing in an African American, Irishman, Native American, and a Chinese man. This new casting works (although the idea of an arrow-wielding Indian taking on a town full of sharp shooters was a little hard to believe).\n\nSCOTT: Greg, anyone who enjoys the western genre will enjoy this movie. Every western trope is trotted out like a showhorse and used effectively. Unlike westerns of yesteryear, this iteration of The Magnificent Seven carries with it some modern sensibilities. Our two main heroes are a woman and an African American, much like last year s Star Wars: The Force Awakens. You know this movie is in safe, capable hands when the lead role is occupied by none other than Denzel Washington and the talented Haley Bennett. They make a good team. In a sense, this movie packs two stories into one. First, we get the  origin story  of these superheroes, the backstory of how seven unlikely men unite to save a town. We are then treated to the heroic fruits of these men s selfless labors. In a way, each member of the ensemble is shown to possess a unique  superpower . For Chisolm, it is leadership, as he skillfully persuades each man to join what seems to be a lost cause. Faraday s power is courage. For Bear, it is strength. For Red Harvest, the bow and arrow. For Billy Rocks, the knife. For Robicheaux, sharpshooting.\n\nGREG: Good call, Scott. In our book  Reel Heroes & Villains  we identify this as an ensemble hero pattern with police or military attributes. Like other ensembles, there is a clear leader and lesser followers. We ve seen this in movies such as Eye in the Sky and Suicide Squad. There are often leaders among the ensemble and Mag7 is no exception. While Chisolm is the leader, it is truly the story of the team. Each character has a role to fill. In terms of mentoring, there is a lack of true mentorship here. There s the implied  law of the west  which seems to guide our heroes. But there s not a single character who guides our heroes, giving advice and gifts to help them along in their quest. You might make an argument that Bogue is a dark mentor for his followers. But that is a stretch. He s a pure evil villain and his minions are just as broadly drawn. However, Chisolm and his friends do mentor the town in how to protect themselves and to take on the responsibility of protecting their town.\n\nSCOTT: I guess it may depend on how you define mentorship. Chisolm does mentor the sharpshooter Robicheaux, who seems to have a bad case of PTSD. Chisolm gives him a good motivational speech, telling him that  what we lost in the fire we can find again in the ashes.  As you point out, Robicheaux and a few others try to mentor the townspeople with mixed success. These ordinary townspeople only have one week to prepare for the onslaught and can only rise to the challenge so much. I would like to point out that once again we have a movie in which a woman character has a transformative influence on male characters. Here it is Emma Cullen, the woman who seeks justice for her murdered husband. We ve seen this pattern of women transforming men in recent movies such as The Light Between Oceans and Snowden. I wouldn t call it a mentoring role, but Cullen does single-handedly set the plotline in motion by offering Chisolm and his men the opportunity for heroism. Cullen is a strong female character who ends up saving Chisolm s life at the end.\n\nGREG: The Magnificent Seven is an entertaining and occasionally humorous film. There aren t many westerns in theaters any more. Mag7 delivered everything you d expect from a great western. There were good guys who weren t all that good, and bad guys who were all bad. There were Indians and bear hunters. It was an all-around good time. I give The Magnificent Seven 4 out of 5 Reels. These are some classic heroes. While they weren t necessarily the most moral of men, they were on the right side of the fight. As an ensemble, they shared the spotlight. While Chisolm took the lead, he had great help from his sidekicks. I give them 4 out of 5 Heroes. The movie was light on the mentorship. Our heroes tried to teach the townspeople to shoot. We were left with the law of the west as the guidepost for our heroes. I can only muster 2 out of 5 Mentor points.  Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: I enjoyed Mag7, too, but probably not quite as much as you did, Greg. As westerns go, this one largely succeeds on the strength of its diverse ensemble cast, led with the cool confidence of Denzel Washington. There are good performances all around, coupled with some great gun battles. For offering a mindless escape from reality that incorporates all the fun elements of a western flick, I award this film 3 Reels out of 5. This ensemble group does indeed travel the hero s journey, and they do so collectively as well as individually. I enjoyed following the various personal growth patterns of several of our heroes. Not all of them were so magnificent, but their selfless sacrifice truly captures a central element of heroism. These heroes merit a rating of 4 Heroes out of 5. Chisolm was a good mentor to a few of the magnificent seven, and Robicheaux attempted to mentor the inept townspeople. There is also implied dark mentorship of our irredeemably evil villain, Bogue. Overall, the mentors were solid although certainly not a prominent feature of this film. These mentors deserve a rating of 3 out of 5.  Movie: Mentors: Heroes:",

            "content": "I don't want to spend too much time comparing this film to the originals (both the 1960 western and the original original, Kurasawa's 'Seven Samurai'), so suffice it to say that this adaptation is a philosophically and emotionally neutered, though significantly more exciting, remake of those films. In a nutshell, director Antoine Fuqua converted the original morally ambiguous story into a traditional 'good vs evil' revenge tale and added a shit-ton of stunts, a bloodless hail of bullets, and a ridiculously high body count. What he did not add was humor, emotion, or pizzazz. The film is silly and even charming in the old Hollywood kind of way... these guys are more than magnificent, they are essentially superheroes, and they never miss a shot. But old-fashioned charm is not enough to carry it through, it needed some jazzing up for modern audiences, but Fuqua's direction is just ho-hum. The pacing is off and it takes too long to get to the big finale. It pays off when you get there, but all that lead-in time would have been better spent on developing the septet as a group and/or exploring their individual motivations. As it stands, it's never clear why most of them are even there at all, particularly Chris Pratt's Faraday, whose participation in the whole showdown is truly inexplicable. All of the characters are painfully underdeveloped - we learn very little about only a few of the Seven, even less about the rest, and nothing about how or why their group has bonded. It makes it hard to care about what happens to them when the inevitable shit goes down. The main characters are offensively one-dimensional: Denzel Washington's protagonist is a pillar of righteousness, while Peter Sarsgaard's over-the-top villain might as well be twirling his mustache. At least they had the decency to make the most badass one an Asian dude, which I like to think is a nod to Kurasawa's classic. The action is entertaining and the actors bring some life to it, but it doesn't pack the emotional punch that it clearly seeks, and it's not nearly fun enough. It is a perfectly okay film, there just isn't anything magnificent about it.",

This movie gives you all that, with a little more. Besides the acting from guys like Denzel Washington (Chisolm), Chris Pratt (Josh Faraday), Ethan Hawke (Goodnight Robicheaux), and more, the action and gunslinger scenes were done really well, and captured the vibes of a classic western movie beautifully. I was genuinely intrigued during those action scenes, and never found myself getting bored. The plot was very simple, basically to the point where it could be considered cliche: town in danger, group of men try to defend it to take it back from another evil man, it seems like a recycled story, but the movie that surrounds that plot was good enough to distract you from its simplicity. Even if you're not into western style movies, I would still recommend this movie to someone who enjoys feel-good action movies, as the dialogue was filled with witty humour, and delivered by some of the top actors in hollywood right now.

The action at the climax of the film is actually a little messy. I believe fighting like that is probably quite realistic to how a gun battle would happen but it comes across a little messy in film format. The climactic fighting would have benefitted from being more structured and broken down into easy to watch chunks. Because essentially you have just watched 1 and a half hours of dramatic build up to then watch a messy, free for all action sequence which leaves you dissapointed. The film does deserve some kudos for having black and asian characters but not mentioning it in the dialouge at all therefore giving the characters respect and prestige without mentioning race. Even although the majority of this film is good it lacks the old school western moments of genuine tension. Sometimes the characters venture into cheesy territory but I think this is a symptom of trying to make the film fast paced they didn't give the time to really develop the characters.

Matthew's wife, Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett), and her friend Teddy Q. (Luke Grimes) ride to the nearest town in search of someone who can help them and come upon warrant officer Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington) of Wichita, Kansas, who initially declines their proposal until he learns of Bogue's involvement. Chisolm sets out to recruit a group of gunslingers who can help him, starting with gambler Joshua Faraday (Chris Pratt). They are later joined by sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), knife-wielding Billy Rocks (Lee Byung-hun), notorious Mexican outlaw Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), skilled tracker Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Comanche warrior Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier). Arriving in Rose Creek, the seven engage in a gunfight with Bogue's enforcer McCann (Cam Gigandet) and his men, shoot dead 22 of them, and drive the corrupt sheriff away with a warning to leave Rose Creek alone. Surmising that Bogue and his forces will return in a week, the seven train the townspeople to defend their home and grow fond of them. As they prepare the town for the violent showdown that they know is coming, these seven mercenaries find themselves fighting for more than money...\n\nThe Magnificent Seven received mixed reviews, with critics praising the cast but noting the film did not offer much that is original or innovative. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"The Magnificent Seven never really lives up to the superlative in its title - or the classics from which it draws inspiration - but remains a moderately diverting action thriller on its own merits.\" IGN critic Terri Schwartz gave the film a 6.7/10 and summarized her review with: \"The Magnificent Seven ends up being a bit too predictable to reach its full potential, but the fun the cast clearly had making it allows the movie to be an enjoyable ride while it lasts. Fuqua does his best to update the Western for the modern audience, but doesn't capture what made those films great in the process. The action is big and sleek, the characters are charismatic and the film looks beautiful, but this won't be a movie that stays with you long after you leave the theater. Chicago Sun-Times' Richard Roeper praised the film by giving a score of 3 stars out of 4, writing: \"Over all, this is a rousing, albeit sometimes cheesy, action-packed Western bolstered by Denzel Washington's baddest-of-the-baddasses lead performance, mostly fine supporting work, and yep, some of the most impressively choreographed extended shootout sequences in recent memory.\" James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave a score of 2 stars out of 4, writing: \"The original The Magnificent Seven found a perfect balance between moments of grand triumph and the understated, solemn denouement. This The Magnificent Seven has the dour ending without the high points preceding it. With two better versions of this story readily available, why bother with this mediocre re-telling? 'Currently recognizable actors' hardly seems like a good justification.\" MTV's Amy Nicholson decried the film, writing: \"Fuqua's made two clean piles separating good and evil, and in doing so, he's thrown away the film's point. Now we can trade our conscience for a bucket of popcorn. Today's The Magnificent Seven is just another superhero flick that spends half its running time assembling a band of bulletproof daredevils. Which makes sense - the original inspired The Avengers, which published its first comic three years after it was a hit.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three out of four stars, saying, \"The new Seven isn't aiming for cinema immortality. It's two hours of hardcore, shoot-em-up pow and it's entertaining as hell.\"\n\nAntoine Fuqua has taken upon himself a difficult task by re-making (with a slightly different storyline) one of the finest westerns ever made and to be honest the re-make/re-telling adds nothing that is even close to the original in terms of greatness. The cast in the original film from 1960 had everything you would want from actors portraying that sort of characters, while in the re-make for example Chris Pratt is hardly equal to Steve McQueen... You simply can\u00b4t replace Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn, Horst Buccholz and Charles Bronson. I think the different characters worked so well in the original while in this case all the characters are just so \"correct\" and so stereotypically chosen in many ways in my opinion. And they don\u00b4t convince you either. The problem here is as well while Fuqua tries to flesh out the characters it doesn\u00b4t work and it still feels like an alibi for shooting up som people on screen and it becomes more like an over the top comic book. The original had this sense of strong layers containing of value, honour, courage, purpose, friendship and solidarity while with Fuqua\u00b4s re-make those layers becomes a part of the shooting range and ends up like bullet holes. I do like the subtle homages we see in severals scenes for example when Faraday uses a shortened lever-action rifle making a nod to Steve McQueen and his character Josh Randall\u00b4s weapon in his series \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\", Chisholm\u00b4s scars from being hanged with a nod to Clint Eastwood\u00b4s character Jed Cooper in \"Hang \u00c9m High\" and the fact that the theme song from the original The Magnificent Seven (1960) plays during the end credits. Nice touch and cred for that. And yes, Fuqua has created a visually stunning film and the editing is quite alright. But, \"The Magnificent Seven\" still becomes a overdramatized lightweight action piece for the Facebook kids and not so much a true western that can measure itself with the original.",

Somewhere along the line someone there got the bright idea to import palm trees, I guess so that it would seem more tropical.\nThat's the mentality in Hollywood. When in doubt imitate. When really in doubt remake. Apparently in the last few decades Hollywood has really been in doubt. Maybe it's because television is getting better and better and shows like Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead have as good, often better production value and much better writing. Or maybe it's because the movie theatres have just made it too expensive to go to the movies nowadays. Whatever the reason, it seems Hollywood is as addicted to remakes as Warren Beatty is to looking at cue cards. There's a story that Sean Penn, when asked to sign on for a remake of Casablanca, said \"I don't think they got it wrong the first time.\". As \nobnoxious as he can sometimes be, the rest of Hollywood could learn a lesson from Penn. Why anyone would think it was a good idea to do a remake of The Magnificent Seven is beyond me. Why I'd ever bother watching it is even more beyond me. I'm a big fan of Denzel Washington and the wonderful character actors Vincent D'Onofrio and Peter Sarsgaard. Chris Pratt is charming and funny. Usually. But we're talking about replacing Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and Eli Wallach, who never met a role he couldn't make unforgettable. Yes, you could argue that the original was a remake of the Akira Kurosawa film The Seven Samurai, but Kurosawa said himself that he was making a samurai western with that film, and the original Magnificent Seven was just, well, cool. The remake is far too muddled and tries too hard to be important and deep. The beauty of the western at its very best is that you can strip away all the complexity of modern life and have a kind of tabula rasa on which to paint your canvas. Less is always more when it comes to westerns. That's not to say that Westerns can't have undertones of complexity. Movies like The Searchers, Shane or Unforgiven have shown us that. But the great western film makers understand that complexity should be a spice that is never overused or overpowering. I know, I'm mixing metaphors all over the place. But my point is that this movie, like so many modern Hollywood movies is heavy handed and clumsy and so quickly becomes boring and at times just silly. Where the original never leaves you wondering why any of these men would choose to put their lives on the line for a village they've never even been to, this remake actually gives Denzel Washington's character a reason, revenge against the villain. Which just makes him an ahole for putting all those lives on the line just so he can get this guy back. They even stick him with the name Chisum, and another character with the name, Goodnight, two very famous Texas cattlemen with trails named after them, because somebody needs to show us how cute and clever they are. And that's the story of this remake. That's the story of virtually all modern Hollywood remakes. Somebody is always trying to impose themselves on the remake, and on us, and only insecure aholes need to impose how clever they are on the world. \nI should know. I'm the most insecure ahole there is. Just ask my friends. \nDon't bother watching this remake. It's too long and it's just stupid. Watch the original. Even if you've already seen it watch it again, because it has Steve McQueen in it. What more reason do you need. Watch The Seven Samurai too. It, like most Kurosawa films, is superb. Lets just hope Hollywood doesn't get any ideas about remaking that...",

            "content": "I tend to have a general disregard for remakes. Movies that strive to stand on the shoulders of greatness just to make a quick profit at the box office. There is one concession that I typically make recognizing a justification for the certain type of remade movie. Some stories are so integral to the human condition that they demand retelling through the experience and sensibilities of each generation. For example, no one would accuse the producers of 'West Side Story' of ripping off Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet.' It was an understandable retelling of the story that presents themes so universal in nature that they transcend time and space. Just this week a pair remakes of iconic released on Blu-ray/DVD, 'Ben Hur' and 'the Magnificent Seven.' My initial reaction is not an uncommon one, \"why bother.\" After all, both of those movies are examples of such incredible filmmaking that I was hard-pressed to imagine how any movie could revisit the themes even to a modern perspective. First I decided to review was the 'Magnificent Seven.' I suppose I was subliminally influenced by the recent HBO series, 'Westworld,' based on the Michael Creighton movie. I admit, that although was unable to accomplish the nigh on impossible task of ascending even close to the original, I did find it to be a reasonable retelling of the story. The idea of a small band of men facing impossible odds, the noble purpose of helping the downtrodden, is a story retold throughout history. Cinematic perspective the roots of this franchise are accepted to have begun with the Akira Kurosawa's 1954 Japanese masterpiece 'Seven Samurai'. The first American western bearing the name, 'The Magnificent Seven,' was in 1960 film by John Sturges. As with most films in this category the most challenging aspect facing the filmmaker is the fact that he is in direct competition with the movie containing scenes, characters, dialogue and a musical score that entered indelibly into the popular culture.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of the themes to be explored in recognition of the universal insight into human nature, requiring some scenes, in this case, is establishing the helpless situation endured by the villagers in the unimaginably savage evil of their warlord oppressor and his minions. The film opens in 1879 in the small mining town of Rose Creek. The town folk peacefully assembled in the church trying to determine what to do with the situation that is about to doom the town. Right on cue, the source of their problems enters corrupt industrialist Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard), is accompanied by contingent men hired from the Blackstone Detective Agency, a less reputable version of the real-life Pinkerton agency. Bogue owns the mining operation extracting gold from the territory. To expedite this goal needs to obtain ownership of all the land. He offers the unreasonably low price of $20 per parcel or else. To demonstrate the undesirability of the alternative is men proceed to kill random people, shooting men in the back and murdering defenseless women. The only one in town with sufficient testicular fortitude was the widow of one of the murdered men; Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) and a friend of my late husband, Teddy Q (Luke Grimes) gathered together everything of value and set off to find somebody who will help liberate their town.\n\nFollowing the general outline of the story, the first order of business is to obtain the services of a leader, a man who would be able to secure the services of a cadre of men with extraordinary abilities and shooting and other forms of killing. That person is found belly rapidly by Emma and the person of Sam Chisholm (Denzel Washington), an African-American warrant officer from Wichita, Kansas, a man who is deadly but driven by a firm sense of justice. One very notable aspect of this film is that it does attempt to be politically correct about the ethnic diversity of the group. It is a matter of historical the fact that many African-American cowboys after the Civil War remained in the West. Also included in this cast has they wanted desperado for Mexico and an assassin from China, lethal in the use of knives. Mr. Washington has the most difficult moment to portray not because of any demands specifically placed on the character because of the legacy of the same character in the original. The leader of the group played by Yul Brynner, who created the role of Chris Adams, a Cajun gunslinger with a bald head and always dressed completely in black. This character became so strongly embedded in the zeitgeist largely because he appeared as the antagonist in the film, 'Westworld.' It remains a strong image that most recently applied in the HBO series as an Easter egg in one episode. Fortunately, Mr. Washington is enacted with the skill and experience to be able to make this role is on while maintaining its integrity within the context of the story.\n\nThe second in command played by Steve McQueen in the original is undertaken by Chris Pratt who has cemented his recognition as an action star due in large part to his contribution to Marvel Cinematic Universe. He brings his trademark playful sense of humor even the most intensely violent scenes. It takes almost an hour of screen time to fully assembled with and set up the initial skirmish to the credit of the director, Antoine Fuqua, the extended position this assignment introduce the remaining members of the seven is nicely paced. There is a well-balanced combination of well-established actors with those that might be less known by the American public. Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke) is a former Confederate sharpshooter with PTSD, always accompanied by his partner and best friend Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee), and Asian immigrant was introduction was reminiscent of the knife versus gun scene that originally introduced James Coburn. Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio) is a not so gentle giant of a man was a trapper with people religious beliefs. He made even pray for you after he kills you. Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) is a Mexican fugitive participating to escape being brought in for his bounty. Finally completing the seven and adding another ethnically diverse character is Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier) a Native American exile from the Comanche nation.\n\nI had the distinct feeling that the reason why the location of the village changed from Mexico to arrest and territories of the United States is a concession made as a result of the recent upswing in negativity towards the people of the country directly past our southern border. It did manage to work particularly considering that most members of the audience the greed of very wealthy man corrupting the law to further his wealth, power, and influence. It also demonstrates that private armies are not something that recently used in our conflicts in the Middle East with little military consulting firms. The resulting film is quite acceptable as a popcorn flick to enjoy on a Saturday evening. It explored the themes adequately but unfortunately took on an impossible task of living up to the original. Besides the many iconic moments of the 1960 version, this variation does lack some of the heart exhibited by the previous movie. For example, the poignant scenes between Charles Bronson and the young Mexican boys have no counterpart in this film. There is also the human nature thread of the youngest of the seven falling in love with the young Mexican woman eventually giving up his gun to stay with her as a farmer. And not telling the story there was a distinct moral that while violence may be necessary to dispel the wicked the farmers and their land will persist. Naturally, one of the most evident and necessary deficiencies is the musical score. The main theme and incidental music created by one of the cinema's top composers, Elmer Bernstein, also has into the collective consciousness of the generation. The original music by Simon Franglen and James Horner suitably helped reinforce the mood like most of the aspects of this film were up against a piece of the fabric of our culture.",

And the decision to diversify the seven, with a Mexican, a black, an Indian, an Asian, and a woman, stinks of political correctness and feels inauthentic.  Also, the relatively bloodless action takes away from the grit and intensity.  Still, the fights are kind of fun and exciting, and are made even more so by James Horner's incredibly sweeping score.

We know in the first 10 minutes that this movie is building up to a huge showdown between the Seven and Bogue and his army, but I felt like it just took so long to get there, especially knowing that we were heading in that direction anyways. The performances were overall alright, I especially liked Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke's performances. The cinematography and overall look of this film is simply amazing, you really feel like you're watching a movie in the West. my final thoughts are that this film was okay, but it had so much potential based on the cast and Director Antoine Fuqua (Director of Southpaw and Training Day). There was a seriously missed opportunity here with The Magnificent Seven, that being said this move is watchable and can be very enjoyable at times. 2 and 1/2 Stars.",

            "content": "Magnificent? Try the 'Perfectly Acceptable\". This remake is a traditional Western with all the lack of character development and mindless action sequences one could hope for. However, the film is buried under corny dialogue, sub-par performances and a paint-by-numbers narrative that never heightens the stakes enough to truly care for the characters. The film clumsily assembles the seven in a quick, almost montage like gathering of the heroes and then just see-saws from unengaging talky scenes, to clippy battle sequences. The final climactic battle is fun for the most part and the overall film is rather enjoyable, but The Magnificent Seven does little to distinguish itself amongst other stronger, grittier Westerns.

            "content": "A story that has been retold in various versions and backdrops across the world makes its way back to Hollywood again with Antoine Fuqua at the helm. He brings together the stars from his smash-hit debut 'Training Day' hoping for a box office miracle that has eluded him. Easily one of the best looking westerns you would come across especially going by Fuqua's technical abilities, aesthetics and attention to detail. But sadly that's all there is to it. \n\nBartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) is a ruthless business man using intimidation and graft to convert a settlement into a mining yard oblivious to its settler's woes. When he takes a step too far by burning down the local church and killing some innocent civilians who revolted against him, Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) who is widowed from the incident vows revenge. She recruits a Warrant Officer Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington) to help her exact revenge who in turn has a bone to pick on Bogue. Knowing Bogue's ego, his love for power and his assets, Chisolm needs an army to stand a chance. \n\nRight from the word go, it is driven by a template featuring all the stereotypes of a western world. Its as if he has made a list of such and stuffed them up into this wafer thin script. The way the town looks, characters of inhabitants, introduction to its protagonist, antagonist, period jokes everything you can think of has been done many times before. As the movie progresses, it becomes utterly predictable voiding it of any thrill or suspense throughout. The characters of the magnificent seven are not well etched out making them just caricatures who would react in a pre-programmed manner to a given situation. The background score is passable, the screenplay is so by the book might well has been written by a film student as part of an assignment, editing department could have worked a little harder to chop off some extra lengthy dinner scenes. But the background locales and the cinematography stands out making it a visual treat. To conclude, I felt that there were moments in the movie which were not seized leaving it underwhelming at the end.\n\nComing to performances starting with Peter Sarsgaard, his character as a baddie in the movie can be defined in like just 3 words. Denzel Washington does shows some moves as a gunslinger but I couldn't buy into his western act. Chris Pratt has been giving the exact same performance since his breakout role as Peter Quill and just serves as a comic relief. Ethen Hawke, the returning star from Training Day and a veteran of unconventional roles bows out here to play the silliest character (in a bad way) written in recent times. Only actor who makes something out of this venture is Haley Bennett - especially because of my lack of expectations on her. She definitely had her moments and her plight and grit looks believable in parts. \n\nUnrealized moments and desperately lacking innovation leaves it underwhelming.",

The villain was ruthless and rich, but not a gunslinger, which may have upset some critics. However, this movie provided ample entertainment and a resolution that I doubt anyone could have predicted. It broke away from the common gunslinger flicks of the past and added a 21st century flavor. Some elements are predictable, but these elements add to the entertainment value. If people would watch a damn movie and stop worrying over the \"superlative\" title, they would finish the story satisfied. I have yet to see a perfect movie, so to complain that this movie didn't meet such expectations, is unjust and ridiculous.  I am going to buy this movie because it deserves some positive feedback, and to be frank, I want to see more movies of this quality rather than the trash that has been released over the last decade.",

            "content": "I was fairly concerned with a remake of a remake but the name Antoine Fuqua gave hope. His movies like Training Day, Shooter, Tears of the Sun and Southpaw are some of my favourite movies. Not all time favourite, but the type of favourite where you can just sit and watch it for the nth time and still enjoy. This adds to that list. It's such a well-made movie and such minor improvements made to the original remake that there are very few complaints.\n\nSTORY - The story is kept the same. A small village is terrorised by a baron and the villagers are divided on whether to cave-in or revolt. So some of them ask out for help to a gunslinger after witnessing his feat of heroism. This hero embarks on a journey to rope in some of the finest assassins to help this village and help get them their village back. Simple story set in a Western-themed time. So far, so good. The premise was acceptable when in it came out in 1960, but in 2016 the expectations are bound to increase. Still, I am going to give them props to keep the story the same as the original. I had watched the original 1960 remake a fair time ago but I do remember that there was a point where one of the characters Chico, infiltrate the bandits to know about their plans and that adds a layer to the bandit gang. That they are so naive that they don't even know who their band members are, plus it shows that they are actually running low on supplies. Here though, there is no such moment except Red Harvest going to check out and coming back and reporting and the villain Bogue, is shown to be one dimensional with no such compelling background and is a villain for the sake of being a villain.\n\nDIRECTION(and dialogue) - I understand this is a remake but I think a few changes should have been made which would have made the movie a bit more relevant. I don't know that whether it was for the sake of promoting multiple races or the demand of the script but when the directors have sought to do it, I think they should have put some more substance into that angle. Here's why. In 2016 everybody appreciates character development and moments which build up an ensemble team. Here the writers didn't explore that part. They just copied and pasted the process of their bonding. There wasn't any definitive moment where the whole group could fall apart because they were from different backgrounds. I mean, I can assume people then were less simpler but human nature isn't that simple. Maybe I am overthinking, but a few more altercations showcasing the different mindsets of the variety of characters would have elevated the movie. The dialogue was top-notch. It didn't have any amount of cheesiness to it like Western movies usually have and it was fun. Other than that, the action scenes were amazing. No doubt about it.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY - The film was mainly comprised of outdoor shots. My favourite shot was before the actual fight when Chisolm is sitting on his horse in the field looking at the village. It was beautiful. The original remake had a lot of outdoor shots of them riding from place to place but it was done so many times that it became very boring. Here, somehow it looked awesome. I mean, making horse-riding look cool in 2016 isn't easy. You have to give credit for that. I can say that because I recently saw a movie Mirzya, in which horse-riding was an integral part but boy, did they make it boring. So yes, horse-riding when done right looks pretty amazing.\n\nACTING - How can you expect this cast to do bad acting? It's impossible. Denzel Washington, awesome. Denzel Washington just plays these grey characters with a heart of gold with ease. Now, when you have Denzel Washington shooting and horse-riding you better thank the movie gods for making this happen. Chris Pratt, again, awesome. He is the perfect guy to star in action-adventure movies. He isn't plastic like usually action-adventure stars turn out to be. He is like a modern day Harrison Ford. Good to see Andy Dwyer travelling in space, chasing dinosaurs and now gun-slinging. He strikes the perfect balance between humour and action. Ethan Hawke, awesome. I hope he gets more movies. He does what he does best and he does it with dedication. Here he did the PTSD affected Goodnight very well. Vincent D'Onofrio, awesome. He was like a gentle giant. I liked the voice change that he did. I think it was his own improvisation and it fitted well. Byung Hun Lee mainly played off Ethan Hawke and it was good. Matt Sensmeier didn't have much scope but he did his part well. It didn't feel like a caricature. Ok, Haley Benett is extremely beautiful. Had to say it. Her character never lost the fact that she has suffered immense loss. Props to the writing department for that too for not striking an unnecessary romance out of nowhere. She was strong, compassionate and humane without being too weepy. My major gripe, like I said before was Peter Saarsgard. I don't know if it was the writing or the acting but Bogue didn't really stand out for me.\n\nFINAL VERDICT - I didn't like that last CGI burial scene. I mean, why don't just shoot that scene? It looked really out of place. OK! This is a very good remake. Watch it if you haven't watched it already. Certainly not any benchmark for remakes but this is the optimum level which should be maintained to make a remake. Or else, just don't. Certainly a benchmark for Western style movies and any action movie.\n\nP.S.- I really didn't expect Matt Bomer to die so early in the movie.",

M7 is only two and half hours.\n- Seven samurai is only Japanese actors movie.M7 's casting is very diverse.\nI like an Asian guy\u00a0,.Byung-hun Lee \n- I liked the climatic battle of M7..It was an epic.\n- I liked an old town in California. That was very different from a Japanese village. \n-Seven samurai is a black and white movie.M7 is a beautiful color movie.\n- I like the ending of the film. just like seven samurai, I had to see the graves. But the graves are magnificent.\n\nThis is a great movie!",

Woo-hoo! Denzel's good. He makes a great badass good guy. Uh, you know what I mean.\n\nAnd yes, the script is quite predictable. And yes the bad guys drop like it's a video game.

All of the magnificent 7 played a fair role,  and they all kicked serious butt.  The ending scene is probably over 20 minutes of non stop gun fighting.  There must be at least 150 kills in the final scene. Let's not mention the humor thrown back and forth between every scene or two to make you smile a bit.  After all,  this is what this movie wanted to bring you - a good time. \n\nIs this magnificent 7 the best action movie of the year?  I can't say,  but this is definitely a movie I'll recommend if anyone wants to see a good action flick.  \n\nDenzel Washington plays a good role and is backed by a strong cast.  \n\nI'm not here to watch and then rate a westerner on its plot,  I'm here to rare it on the entertainment from its action.  And I can tell you that the entire movie is more than satisfying.  Other than a few rushed scenes,  the movie presents itself very well. \n\nThe action scenes are as top notch as you can get with single fire rifles and pistols.  \nThe ending scene is what makes the movie.

Despite the similarity, it had its own unique points including the nail biting and quite emotional action scenes which I believe was the movie's strongest point. The movie was well casted, the characters were quite believable. Denzel and Christ Pratt delivered outstanding performances not to take away anything from the other 5 main actors. Despite these strong points I thought that the moive somewhat struggled in the build up to the action scenes and the storyline could have been a bit more convincing especially where Denzel seeks to recruit the men for is magnificent 7 based on the premise that he is asking them to potentially give away their lives for but a sack of coins (that would be split). The ending I also found to be a but dry. But nevertheless this move is still a great one and receives an 83% on my score sheet.",

But we all know the story, how it begins and how it ends, since it was the remake of the 1960 film. Actually, it was a successful remake, but not as magnificent as the original. Maybe the youngsters might like this one better.\n\nThe director's favourite, Denzel Washington in one of the main characters. Not much change in the theme, except the screenplay was little altered, especially diversity in the film characters and their developments. Because nowadays that's a big issue in Hollywood cinema. So it was led by Denzel and possibly there will be a sequel like the 'Ocean's' trilogy.\n\nThe people from a small mining town decides to hire men with guns to fight the villainous businessman who slaughtered their loved ones. The unusual seven men come together and form a team with a plan to defend the town. So what comes next is the battle between the good and the bad that lasts for the whole final act.\n\nThe setting was completely refreshing, but slightly disappointing action sequences. All the seven characters were unique and awesome, but the film lacked the great battle scene that defines each one of them. Surely I favour it just for once watch that told from the todays imagination of the 1870s era. Feels like it should have been better, but in the end it is a satisfying film.\n\n6.5/10",

I like half of Antoine Fuqua's work, and the other half I just didn't see, and also with the creator of True Detective Nic Pizzolatto in his first film work as a co-writer. Now I haven't seen any of the original films from the previous remake to Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, so I'm coming in with no knowledge of what it's about, and I ended up having a great time with this. The cast are fantastic in this, and the highlights are from Denzel Washington who always does a great job at what does, Chris Pratt who is just likable and having fun with this, and Vincent D'Onofrio who is just eating his performance with him being over-the-top, which gives some laughs out of me. The best parts of the film are the action scenes which Fuqua knows how to shot the action scenes as there's a lot of stuff going on, but you can see it what's happening and be entertained, and the interactions of the team themselves because they give a lot of interesting conversations and hilarious moments that I would just like the movie about them talking to each other. The characters are pretty memorable, and I find the climax very fun, even though it's 30 minutes, which for me, is more than I can say for Rogue One because I actually care about the characters in here. The score by James Horner in his last score, and Simon Franglen is very western that at times, sounded like Uncharted, which is really cool to listen. Peter Sarsgaard is having fun in as the villain, but his character was a bit weak in this that I sometimes forget he was even in it. The plot is generic from beginning to end on not only westerns, but also action films in general, there's predictable moments in there, even when there's one of the characters that left because of the situation that he's in, which is understandable, but you know what's going to happen afterwards. The Magnificent Seven is a really good movie that I was left with a smile which made me glad that I was entertained.",

            "content": "So surely everyone knows this is a modern remake of the old 1960's classic western, which itself was a remake of the old 1954 Japanese classic 'The Seven Samurai'. And again surely everyone knows how influential both movies, especially the 54 film, have been in cinematic history. So this does beg the question, do we really need to see yet another remake of this concept? Do we really need an almost exact copy of the 1960's version merely with up to date stars? The answer to that is no we don't.\n\nSo what we have here is essentially the same film albeit with minor changes throughout, because you can't make a beat for beat remake can you (ahem!). So that means you have a small town in the wild west of America that is under threat from a corrupt industrialist, a Mr Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard). Mr Bartholomew is using the good people of Rose Creek as slaves to mine for gold, I think that's what it was, doesn't really matter. His henchmen kill a load of innocents when they stand up to him which forces Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) to go off in search of help. Cullen comes across warrant officer Sam Chisholm (Denzel Washington) and manages to convince him for the job. Chisholm then sets off to hire more good men to help him. What follows is surely obvious to all.\n\nSo lets look at the heroes, the seven. Well its a nicely rounded, dare I say, politically correct group of gunslingers that's for sure. Most of whom are gunslingers by default but some have other skills too. Yes the group is diverse but for me it was a little too obviously diverse. You've almost got a person to represent every community, which is fine for marketing purposes (and today's overly sensitive climate) obviously, but it just seemed a bit too forced to me.\n\nSo looking at the characters what have we got. Denzel Washington naturally plays the all round hero and leader of the gang, Sam Chisholm. Of course we discover that Bogue had killed his family years earlier so that's very convenient and cliched. The overrated Chris Pratt is Joshua Faraday, a ladies man and slick gambler. Ethan Hawke plays the hard to pronounce and stupidly named Goodnight Robicheaux. A southern dandy type who fought for the confederacy and is a sharpshooter, he's basically the Doc Holliday of the bunch. Vincent D'Onofrio plays Jack Horne, a larger than life man of the wild who likes to stab people and wears an odd hat. Lee Byung-hun is Billy Rocks (again stupid name), an immigrant who is an expert with knives and doesn't use martial arts amazingly. \n\nManuel Garcia-Rulfo is the stereotypical Mexican of the team who uses two guns. And lastly Martin Sensmeier plays the native American Red Harvest who does exactly what you'd expect the character to do, looks exactly as you'd expect him to look and joins the team for no real reason whatsoever. Its like he joins just so they have a native American on the team. But wait there's more! Just to really make sure everyone is covered in this modern remake, we even get a woman on the team at one point (Cullen), technically. Nothing wrong with that of course, but again it just feels a bit forced, a bit obvious.\n\nSo how do they compare to the 1960's seven? Well lets be frank here, they can't compare in any way, how could they, I don't even have to explain why. Plot wise its actually a very similar affair though. The old seven consisted of a Cajun (the fast gun), a drifter (the humorous one), a knife expert (errr...the fast knife guy), a fortune seeker (after lots of loot any way possible), a traumatised veteran (once feared, since lost his nerve), a brash young gunfighter (wanting a reputation as a tough guy and gunslinger), and a half Mexican, half Irish professional in dire need of cash (the loser?). \n\nThe old movie does utilise diversity for sure but its not as obvious, not as in your face, the old seven feel a bit more natural. But the old team were helping Mexican townsfolk where as the new movie shows the seven helping a more white European bunch of townsfolk. Some interesting switches there. Obviously there are plot differences between the 1960's version and this new remake, I won't delve into them as this isn't really a comparison of both movies. I compared the characters because they are clearly the meat and potatoes of the movies and in both cases have big A-list names attached. \n\nThis remake is a technically impressive film that's for sure. Nothing that will blow your mind I might add as we've seen it all before, but nonetheless, credit where credits due, this film does look the bees knees. The camera work on the landscapes, the wild west sets both exterior and interior, the costumes, the weapon close-ups, the make-up, the pinging bullets, stunts, the camera work on gunslinging etc...Everything looks slick, crisp and completely authentic, as said...as you would expect these days. \n\nBut even though the majority of the movie does look sweet, they do mess things up by going over the top in places. For example the character of Billy Rocks, sure he looks cool...but maybe too cool? Having all these small katana blades around his waist seemed a bit silly to me, a bit too comicbook-ish. All the main heroes seemed a tad overdressed for my liking, a bit too flash really. Also at points the camera work/angles on some gun fights almost seemed almost too good, too flashy; maybe a more grounded approach would have looked better?\n\nAs for action, fisticuffs and other such cliches, well its a mixed bag of dull and dumb truth be told. For a start we all know what's gonna happen, how its gonna end. We all know most of the good guys will be killed off in heroic last stands (I won't say who but...its all very clearly politically correct put it that way). The gun fights are loud and realistic but totally cliched and uneventful. The big finale at the end is even more cliched and even more ridiculous than I even thought possible. Big bad guy Bogues has this entire army of a few hundred men descending on this small town, yet seven men manage to fend almost all of them off, riiight. All of the good guys seem to have guns with infinite bullets in them, hardly ever do we see much reloading. \n\nThe bad guys are a constant stream of stupidity, literally one after another running into plain view for the good guys to gun down easily. All the bad guys are utterly useless at gun fighting...and taking cover. And lastly, Bogues has around two hundred men I think it was, so that's a lot sure. But I would say at least half are killed in the first wave of attack on the town. Then after that each of the seven take down loads of these useless cowboys, one after another like on a shooting range. It just feels like the good guys take down way too many bad guys, of which there seems to be an endless stream. Plus we never see any horses get killed despite the fact that clearly tonnes would have been blown to pieces.\n\nOn one hand a modern retelling is a good way to show how an old movie could look with up to date effects, camera work, stunts etc...On the other hand it can still be completely pointless in many cases, and this just happens to be another case. Bottom line, all you have here is a remake just for the sake of a remake in order to use current big bankable stars together. Why do I get the feeling the bigwigs behind this are just jumping on the current 'Avengers' team-up angle, sticking groups of A-list names together in anything they can. The thing is they didn't even make good casting choices in my opinion. There are way better and more interesting actors that could have been cast here, both A-list and B-list/quirky character actors. There really is no reason to ever come back to this after your first viewing; why would you when you have two far better original movies to watch instead. Yep this flick isn't gonna stick with you for very long, already forgotten, next!",

This is far from the slow-burning artistic piece most modern westerns aim to be. It is basically simple gun-shooting cowboy fun...but it is fun. It frequently pays homage to the old genre: Gun duels, tense bar scenes, heavy drinking. Often feels like it is reeling through the cliches for no significant purpose and the gun-slinging antics gets repetitive, however a film in this setting does not have much more at its disposal. Most importantly it is the seven protagonists which must be a success and luckily they are all likeable. Denzel is reliably cool in the lead, Chris Pratt adds decent banter, Ethan Hawke acts as the flawed hero while Byung-hun Lee, perhaps stereo-typically, injects an impressive variation of knife combat. The seven protagonists appear to be picked on ethnic diversity more than anything but at least they all contribute positively and convince the audience to root for them at the end of the day, though that might also be due to a weak villain who fails to bring any charisma of his own. I doubt 'The Magnificent Seven' will ever be discussed as a classic like its 1960 counterpart but it holds up as easy entertainment for a lazy night in.",

The humor didn't work all that well for me, which surprises me because I find Chris Pratt so funny, but at least it wasn't so bad I was cringing. The cast of actors is top-notch and each of them delivered something special. There might have been a couple that I wished were featured more prominently, because their characters worked so well for me but I understand there was only so much screen-time to go around. The entire third act is an elaborate fight scene that was captured extremely well. I always felt like I knew what was going on, where people were, and what they were trying to do, which is quite difficult in films with this many characters. Easily the biggest shortcoming in the film was the conclusion. If done right it could have been emotionally devastating, but they didn't pull that off so I left the theater with dry eyes. However, I also left the theater with a smile on my face because this Magnificent Seven made for a fun two hours at the movies.",

If you are a fan of movies in general, you already know the story: there's a poor farming village being bullied by the wealthy and powerful.  They have no choice but to gather everything they have to hire mercenaries to help protect them.  Enter seven cowboys/samurai.  Yes, this is a remake of a remake, and no, that didn't make me any less excited about it.  I love Westerns, but they are relatively rare in modern cinema; we no longer live in the 50's and 60's where they were just everywhere, so I have learned to grab them when I can get it.  The trailer to this looked positively badass, and yeah, it did not leave me with an ounce of disappointment.  Now I liked the original, but it does have pacing issues that don't translate all that well to a modern audience (which I realize is something that is not necessarily the movie's fault).  While this film here does take its time introducing you to all of the characters, it moves relatively quickly.  Also, with the original Magnificent Seven, there were a few cowboys that faded into the background.  Not here.  Every single one has a personality (albeit stereotypical), and while the amount of screen time is going to the bigger names as expected, you walk away remembering every single character.  This is because they all have personality and their own specific set of skills that make them memorable.  It's an old story that's tried and true, and there is nothing wrong with that.  It actually ends up succeeding on a number of different levels, and the more I think about it, the more I like it.  It's not a perfect movie, but I wasn't expecting it to be.  My biggest gripe with this is that the script could have sparkled more, and it would have benefited from a pass from a punch up writer.  It's also a superhero movie in guise of a Western, and it really does fit the template of The Avengers; you have these larger than life heroes coming together to save the day in extravagant fashion.  Because of that, the danger doesn't really feel as palpable as it could be because they hardly get grazed... that is, until the end.  The gunplay in this is pretty stellar, and it pulls off almost every trick shot in the book.  The whole time you are waiting for this climatic showdown to be reached, and when you finally get there, it gives you every thing you paid for.  If you are a Western lover like I am, you should go out and support this, because it is a crowd pleaser.",

With so many characters all with their own backstories there was only so much time they could spend introducing them all along with the backstory to the plot and have an actual movie after all that. Because of that reason some of the characters get a little over-looked, for instance there is who I can only remember as 'The Mexican' and his whole story is that he is a criminal who has 3 women called Maria.\n\nOverall its a fun film and worth a watch if you don't take it too seriously",

He gathers his tough multi-ethnic group of misfits which includes, Chris Pratt who is terrific as a quick-draw cardsharp and ballsy gunslinger, a Comanche brave, well-played by Martin Sensmeier, a Chinese assassin and knife-expert, nicely played by Korean star Lee Byung-hun, a stocky Indian hunter, wonderfully played by the scene-stealing Vincent D'Onofrio, a laconic outlaw, excellently played by Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and a Confederate sharpshooter, marvelously played by Enthan Hawke, to fight against and stop an evil robber baron Bartholomew Bogue, played superbly Peter Sarsgaad, who with his army of hired gunmen has seized a town and killed many of it's innocent citizens. Astute direction by Fuqua, with stunning and impressive action sequences and shootouts. A solid score by the late great James Horner and the glorious return of Elmer Bernstein's original theme. This motion picture is no-where near the caliber of the original classic, but it is a well-crafted and fun western film. Highly recommended.",

First off, this film is AWESOME and as much as the original film has its place, it definitely benefits from today's technical wizardry and it's one of those cases where the remake is far superior to the original. The film stars Denzel Washington, as the leader of the group, and in typical Denzel fashion, he commands the screen throughout and it was really refreshing to see an African-American be the lead in a western. Also starring is Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Haley Bennett,  Byung-hun Lee and Peter Sarsgaard as the ruthless villain who kills without mercy. One major thing to commend this film for is its ethnically diverse cast and everyone truly does a remarkable job, the highlights being Washington, Pratt, and Hawke while D'Onofrio adds some great comedic relief. Antoine Fuqua directs, re-teaming with frequent collabs Washington and Hawke, and he really is the star of this movie bringing his gritty, hard-hitting violence and brilliant cinematography to the forefront in very impressive ways. Speaking of violence, the gun battles and close-quarters combat scenes in this film  are so relentless and brutal that I'm positive this is the most violent PG-13 film ever made; and I loved every minute of it. The story plays out fairly typically of the western genre; all of the characters are pretty much invincible and never miss their targets, but Fuqua does throw in some nice curveballs I didn't see coming and I really appreciated the unpredictability. Bottom line: if you're a fan of westerns and/or the original Magnificent Seven, you should find enjoyment here, and for the so-so fans of westerns, take comfort in knowing that this film gets straight to the point and is almost a non-stop, action thrill ride well worth seeing!",

Completely re-imagines the plot of the original movie; might as well be called something entirely different. Swaps out some of the White guys from the original for a Black, an Asian, and a Native dude, but this works quite well and doesn't feel forced (though the lack of people calling Denzel Washington \"nigger\" seems rather odd, given the time period). Washington is his usual badass self, with a backstory that only gets revealed in full at the very end. Chris Pratt was given a few dumb moments of comedy that fell flat for the most part, but his part at the end is fantastic. I felt that the Native guy and the Asian weren't given as much screentime as they should have, but they weren't screwed intentionally I don't think. Just a lack of seeing them gank some dudes with their badass skills. They also gave a woman a key role in the film; Haley Bennett does a great job defending her home and getting shit done. The only weak performance that comes to mind is Peter Sarsgaard as Bogue. I guess it's more realistic to not have everyone be a capable public speaker or intimidating presence, but for the main villain, he lacked a commanding nature for the most part.\n\nOverall, a great action movie, good storyline, cool fight scenes, and a better plot than the original (which I looked up on Wikipedia, lol).

            "content": "Antoine Fuqua has proved his stylistic excellence in a variety of genres and he only confirms his mastery of genre aesthetics with his entertaining re-telling of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. While this remake does not quite rise to the level of Sturges' original western epic or Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI (which inspired THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN), it does take the framework and spirit of the previous stories and morph them to Fuqua's narrative interests. These interests indeed seem to warrant the updated version of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN by encouraging some awareness regarding exploitation of the poor. Sadly, the story-telling is sometimes painfully straight-forward and the themes, while relevant, are paper thin. The script is also occasionally laden with potentially over-literal adherence to the diction of the period by including various jokes about race. If these jokes were included to encourage reflexivity, that may be one thing - sadly, the diction seems to be selectively included only to solicit laughs from passive audience members.\nOn the upside, the charismatic cast generally do a good job of executing Fuqua's vision of the through-line narrative and aesthetic choices. Denzel Washington is reliable as always with Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo performing excellent supporting roles with unique and fascinating physical and vocal characterizations. Chris Pratt's character is clearly intended as the prominent supporting part, but, as much as I typically enjoy Chris Pratt, he comes off as playing just another iteration of Owen Grady or Peter Quill. The most truly impressive supporting performance comes from Peter Sarsgaard's nervous, but cocky exploitative villain. Sarsgaard brings physical and vocal contrast to the diction of his character which makes for a magnetizing on-screen presence. \nIn addition to the acting performances, the cinematography and score felt like high points of the movie to me as well. The musical score was written by the late James Horner and completed for the picture with the help of Simon Franglen. Horner's final soundtrack is delightfully appropriate to Fuqua's narrative beats and the aesthetics of this particular action/western cross-genre. \nIn sum, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN stumbles in writing and some of the characterization, but it is entertaining and even, at times, beautiful in its high points - namely Fuqua's direction, Hawke and Sarsgaard's acting, and Horner's clever score.",

Well, the story is the same-ole-same-ole, but the action is way beyond of what you know of a normal Western flick where 90% is plain lame talk. In many ways it has classical touches of Sergio, but with a very modern fast paced appeal, thus never drifting into dull long scenes which one hopes to end asap. The final shoot-out is a spectacle on its own; a bit over the top with more guys dying than in a Rambo movie, but it's well done and giving something to any traditionalist as well as young moviegoers. 8 out of 10 stars.",

I don't fault the movie too much for it because the western genre is notorious for the climactic showdown gunfight between the cathartic powers of good and evil. The character development is slightly lacking in this film but I understand that is because the movie is more about the action than the characters.

            "content": "When it comes to movie remakes nowadays, most of them end up all having one thing in common... Pretty much ALL of them end up sucking!!! All of these remakes seem to fail to keep the spirit of the original version (which is one of the most important factors in remaking a movie) and instead, tries to modernize it and make it fit into the times of today. However, this one seems to capture a lot of peoples attention for some reason. Maybe it's the fact that Chris Pratt is in the movie, maybe it's that Denzel Washington is back to being in movies, maybe it's that this remake seems to show a lot of promise, who knows? But looking into this film itself, will it be as magnificent as the original version, or is the title hiding something not-so magnificent from us? Let's find out by taking a look at the 2016 remake of, \"The Magnificent Seven\"\n\nTHE STORY\nAs I said earlier, One important factor of remaking a movie is to keep the spirit but at the same time, give it a bit of modern style, and to this films credit, it actually does that very well here. Unlike most remakes nowadays, this film does a good job of retelling the story of how a small town in the old west during the 1800s is being used for mining, and a villainous businessman is taking over the land and vowing to dispose of anyone who stands in his way. Then we get a hard ass kind of guy who people think is a sheriff and they convince him to save their town from being destroyed by the miners and the villain who is operating them. Not only do they do a good job of executing the story, but they also do a pretty good job with some of the modernization they give it, and it really shows that the writers of the story have talent. HOWEVER, there is a big catch to this. Since part of remaking a movie is to give it modernization, The modernization trait comes in with the humor. Granted that I did get some laughs out of this film, a good majority of the humor ends up falling very flat and instead of laughing, you're wondering to yourself, \"Was that a joke or was that meant to be taken serious?\" Also, some of the action in this movie makes it look like any other western movie with cowboys on horses, drinking and smoking, and shooting one another. And because of that, the film falls flat in the process of recreating a story. And that's a major problem considering that this is a remake and the job is to recreate a movie story that's already been told. The story does have lots of struggles, but it does a better job than most movie remakes have done in recent years.\n\nTHE VISUALS\nOne of the films strongest aspects here is definitely the visuals! Since this is a western film, you can tell that the set designers and costume designers really did put a lot of effort in the visuals. And they really do look good. The movie gives us an old 1800s western town where everything is made out of wood and they have a church at the end of the town, plus the saloons and restaurants, and even the fields where horses are. Also, aside from the towns, there are also forests and fields and even the area where the enemy is doing the mining actually do look very realistic. Not to mention the editing and the fight scenes make it look pretty good too, you can really tell that the filmmakers put some good effort into it all. But, despite the visuals looking good, there are some things that could be problematic. Most namingly, the towns themselves. Even though I said that the 1800s style town was created nicely, the problem with that is the fact that, this is a western movie. Despite the visuals looking nice, they look very unoriginal and it seems like it was just copied and pasted from the last western movie we got. Also, despite the action scenes and the big gun fight at the end looking cool and very intense, just like the visuals, it's unoriginal. It's just like every other western movie out there and although it?s at least fun to watch, it doesn't look as fun as it normally would. Which is a major problem considering how this is a western movie and we would normally get excited at that kind of thing. The Visuals are definitely not original, but they certainly do look great.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS\nSo we have a decently retold story with lack of humor, unoriginal but nicely done visuals, what are we missing? Ahhhhh, yes, the character aspect of the film. When it comes to the characters, they're are a lot of them in here. However, the ones we usually focus on are a very select few. First we have Chisolm, he's the hard ass character that everyone seems to look at with fear, but gets confused as a local sheriff and is pleaded and begged to go and kill the villain who's destroying the town because of mining for gold. He's one of the characters that has good development, in a way that he wants to do the job, but at the same time, he just wants to get from point A to point B. Then we have Josh Faraday, played by Chris Pratt. He brings out a lot of the charm and fun that the movie has to offer. Even if he's not the main character, he certainly knows how to make the audience laugh with all of the tricks up his sleeve. Then we have Bartholomew Bogue, the villain that wants to rid the people of their town so he can destroy it to mine for gold. And he vows to kill anyone who stands in their way. The film really does a good job at making him the most menacing villain in any western movie I've seen, where he really does what he needs to do to achieve his goal and makes sure that nothing will stand in the way. The only other character worth noting is Emma Cullen. She's the one who begs and pleads Chisolm to go after Bartholomew after he takes over the town, murders her husband in cold blood, and burns down the church that the town went to. You can tell that she really has a goal that she wants to achieve, which is vengeance on Bartholomew for scarring the town for life and threatening to come back in three weeks to finish his job. There's not much depth in her, but she has some development that makes her an interesting character. As for the other characters like Billy, Goodnight, Jack, and the other characters, Sure they do have their purpose in this film, but they're not really worth noting since they're either part of Chisolm's team, or working with the villain. The characters aren't necessarily perfect, but most of them aren't bad either.\n\nUnlike most remakes nowadays, this one is actually not bad. But that's not saying it's perfect. The Magnificent Seven is fine on it's own with a decently told story, visuals that are nice on their own, and a group of decently executed characters, but the lack of originality and lack of humor really weigh it down from being one of the better remakes we've gotten. I wouldn't really say that this is a must watch, but if you like the original versions of this film, then go ahead and watch it. If you like western movies, you'll definitely get a kick out of this. If you're looking for something to watch just for the sake of watching something, I'd say wait until you can rent it or stream it on Netflix or Hulu. The one thing that this movie does is it gives us hope for many other upcoming remakes we're going to get in the near future. Sure, not all of them will be perfect or even good, but this one at least gives us a bit of hope that we could have some good ones coming our way. \n\nSTORY: 7/10\nVISUALS: 8/10\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\n\nFINAL SCORE: 7/10",

Chris Pratt is so-so as drunken gunman Josh Faraday.  He is good here, but he has done better in other roles.  The comic relief is provided by former \"Law and Order:  Criminal Intent\" star Vincent D'Onofrio.  He gives the best performance of all of the hired guns.  The script suffers from being a little formulaic.  Chisolm and his hired hands pretty much overnight turn a bunch of farmers into excellent shots and elite fighters.  In the climactic battle all seems lost against  Bogue and his men.  Until a last minute miracle happens.  Still despite the flaws the movie has enough positive points for me to give it a mild recommendation.  Denzel Washington is no Yul Brenner, but he does well here.",

While the film succeeds in giving us a few great characters that we care about, it's downfalls come when you look at the side characters. The action in the movie is probably just about the most violent you can get with PG-13, maybe the most violent PG-13 movie I've ever seen (aside from Casino Royale, probably). Antoine Fuqua's direction is on point, and it's great having him work with Denzel Washington again. Unfortunately, in the end, \"The Magnificent Seven\" doesn't focus on it's side characters enough, has a bare bones western movie plot, and has an underdeveloped villain who had the potential to separate this from other westerns. On the upside, it has great performances from Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, and (in my opinion) Vincent D'onofrio. Nevertheless, I had a great time with \"The Magnificent Seven\" and I would highly recommend seeing it in theaters, or at least on home video.",

Originally inspired by Akira Kurosawa's iconic 1954 film Seven Samurai, in this interpretation, Denzel Washington plays Sam Chisolm, a bounty hunter/Warrants Officer who has just made a spectacular entrance with his latest capture. This garners the attention of Emma Cullen (Halley Bennett) a widow seeking justice for the massacre of her husband & fellow townspeople of Rose Creek by Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) & his men who are ruthlessly intent on mining the area for gold. Chisolm has his own grudge against Bogue & agrees to take on the daunting task of opposing Bogue's considerable forces. He sets about assembling a group of men worthy of the challenge; Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt,) a wise-cracking gambler, Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke) notorious sharpshooter, Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio) a quirky tracker, Billy Rocks, a skilled knifesman, a Mexican outlaw & a stray Commanche. What begins for each as a position for profit becomes the act of ultimate heroism. The Magnificent Seven was a highly entertaining western with the right combination of gunplay & wry humor. The performances from this stellar cast were solid. SEE THIS FILM.",

            "content": "'The Magnificent Seven' was originally based on one of the most thrilling movie epics of all time, a 1954 Japanese film, Seven Samurai from a Master Filmmaker Akira Kurosawa that tells the story of a sixteenth-century village whose desperate inhabitants hire the eponymous warriors to protect them from invading bandits. The film itself was great in its own right, after its success, Hollywood filmmakers had showed their interests on translating the theme into something western until John Sturges' western action interpretation of the same title came out in 1960. I didn't know it was actually based on a Japanese film. So I did my research on it.\n\nThis year's The Magnificent Seven reunites Antoine Fuqua, Denzen Washington and Ethan Hawke who collaborated for a few movies before (Training Day, Brooklyn's Finest and Equalizer) which are really good films. The story of these Seven bad guys assembled together to help a small town was told many times. Each remake had different perspective but Antoine Fuqua's remake of the 21st Century is a fun action-packed western movie loaded with some of the most amazingly executed action sequences I've seen all year or probably in years.\n\nWho doesn't want to see Denzel Washington on a horse? Well, you can put him in any movies, I'm gonna watch it and I'm surely will enjoy it. I've had tons of fun right from the beginning of this film. Sam Chisolm is magnificently played by Denzel Washington. As well as an entertaining work by Chris Pratt's Joshua Faraday. Ethan Hawke as the (sharpshooter) Goodnight Robicheaux, Vincent D'Onofrio as Jack Horne, Byung-hun Lee as Billy Rocks, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Vasquez and Martin Sensmeier Red Harvest. One of the things I like about it is the films motivation not to rely on some other western films in the past. I have not seen personally the 1960's The Magnificent Seven so I can't compare to it yet but I've seen a lot of western films before that gives me similar vibe as this film. The character development is one of the standouts of this film.\n\nPeter Sarsgaard gives an effective work as Bartholomew Bogue, he is unsympathetic villain and irritating at times in an effective way, he nailed every scene he's in. Haley Bennett gives an stellar work as Emma Cullen. Unlike Coen Brother's True Grit, and Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven doesn't have that level of western dialogues and hardcore drama, it instead gives you an instant fun. American Filmmakers had remade plenty of foreign films before, The Magnificent Seven is just one of them. The film itself knew exactly what it wanted to be, it continuously tries to give us something new. Unlike any other western films coming out recently. The action sequences doesn't feel modern 'cause it didn't go to modern usage of shaky cams, as well as quick cuts. But every shot is incredibly edited here. As well as James Horner and Simon Franglen's score.\n\nWe don't get good westerns anymore, overall, The Magnificent Seven is a total blast action-packed filled with stunning and wide shots cinema style. I totally totally recommend this film. PLEASE DO NOT wait to see it on a device you can hold in your hands.",

Apart from that, the story develops well and ends in a well choreographed showdown which has a few surprises. I don't recall much about the original movie. But this one was entertaining enough.

It wasn't really awards bait the first time around and I couldn't expect the same or more now. Without the financial pressures earlier summer blockbusters face, the movie really had two simple, achievable goals. I expected to have a lot of fun and for the director/writers to retool the cast and script enough to properly put the 60's era Western racism behind us. In that respect, The Magnificent Seven actually went above and beyond. Not only was it quite an entertaining ride, full of great acting and a nice blend of racially appropriate characters but the movie actually brought stakes to the table, along with a halfway not cliche finish. Several major characters, nigh un-killable in lesser films, actually died and I didn't have to deal with some hogtied romance between two highly unlikely (but likely by Hollywood standards) characters. As icing on the cake, I got to watch a hell of a Denzel performance and in addition to properly casting a diverse portfolio of actors, the movie brought a hint of the Modern Western movement to the table, rewriting the story enough to highlight (in simple action film terms) the evils of the rampant capitalism and environmental destruction that ran wild through the American West. It isn't as nuanced as Bone Tomahawk or The Revenant but for a blockbuster, I was pleased. Overall, I left the theater very happy and very entertained and more importantly perhaps, for maybe the first time this summer, Hollywood managed to deliver a movie that perfectly fit its role and expectations. Clearly that doesn't really translate into profits but as a moviegoer with half a brain, I really appreciate it.",

When you compare it to classics like \"Seven Samurai\" and the original \"The Magnificent Seven\", of course it somewhat suffers in comparison. That said, I believe that if a film accomplishes what it sets out to do, then you can't call it a failure. Antoine Fuqua isn't trying to make a film that's as philosophically deep as \"Seven Samurai\". He's looking more at the 1960 classic western and saying that it, for our modern times, could be retold as a grittier but still fun homage to one of the great film genres. And I think he mostly accomplishes that goal. This is a fun movie that has touches of the great western directors all over it. The landscapes look straight out of a John Ford film and the intense close-ups are very reminiscent of Sergio Leone. The cast is great with the standouts for me being Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, and Ethan Hawke. And the cast is something that I think is actually better than the original. Something about a bunch of people from different backgrounds coming together to take down a greedy, corrupt businessman really seems appropriate for today's political climate. The cast? Great. The action? Outstanding. The music? Wonderful (R.I.P. James Horner). This isn't trying to be a game changing western but a fun western for 2016. It succeeds, big time.",

The original Magnificent Seven was not (in my opinion) a true classic on the order of High Noon, The Searchers, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, or Once Upon a Time in the West.  Instead it was a damn good popcorn movie that happened to be a remake of the near perfect Akira Kurosawa film, Seven Samurai.  So it's fitting that the new Magnificent Seven ends up being a competent picture but fails to compare to modern epics such as Unforgiven, True Grit (remake), The Proposition, or Open Range.  This is a not a meditative post-modern deconstruction of the western genre.  But it doesn't need to be.  With a few details changed and more ethnically diverse cast for the twenty-first century, Mag Seven follows the rough beats of the story you've seen before with a tad bit more violence.  Denzel Washington does well in the Yul Brynner role, reminding us that he is still one of the last face-on-the poster stars left in Hollywood that can make a western do blockbuster business.  Chris Pratt mirrors Steve McQueen a bit and it's shocking he has not done more westerns until now.  All of the title characters are interesting and cool, and it's always a damn shame when it's time to kill one off.  The villains are pretty average, but the film's opening ten minutes do a good job of making the audience want to see them meet elaborate deaths.  Which they do.  An excellent rental choice, but if this doesn't strike your fancy there is still the best version of this story, Seven Samurai, available at a local library near you!",

Does Hollywood lack diversity most of the time? Yes, but tokenism does nothing meaningful to progress minority visibility. Denzel Washington is a fine leading man, but just because he's cast in this historically unlikely role doesn't make up for a lack of black nominees at the Oscars or a lack of black casting choices. Similarly, having an Asian, Native American, and Latino seems like the filmmakers were going by a racial checklist. But where's the Inuit? Where's the Arab? Where's the Pacific Islander? Those don't register on the demographic checklist in any substantial way, so they aren't necessary in terms of profitability. By no means is this a historical film, and it is a remake of a remake, where both of the originals were drastically more engaging. There is no sacred cow being slaughtered here, so not only is the film unnecessary, it isn't even relevant. And thus, it accomplishes nothing. If you haven't seen either \"Seven Samurai\" or the 1960 film, you should watch one or both of those instead of wasting 2 hours on this.",

            "content": "Magnificent 7 was a movie I knew very little about til the trailer hit. I haven't seen the original so my expectations for this movie was set completely from what I saw in the trailer. I loved this trailer. The tone it set gave you a rush of adrenaline and got me so excited for this movie. However, once I walked in, it didn't continue.\nThere is one word to summaries this movie for me, disappointing. This movie was built up so much in my head that when I got there, it was just a let down. While there were some positives that I really did enjoy about the film, I think that the overall story and writing of the film let it down dramatically.\nThe main problem I had with Magnificent 7 was the final act. First of all, it was just too long. There got to a point that you think it is over but they find a way to revamp it and continue it one even further. While the action looked amazing, which I will touch on late, I just found that I was getting bored with the constant and what felt like pointless fighting. The second problem I had with it was the believability. While in a film you commonly expect that the hero with be able to handle themselves against a small group of thugs, but this took it out of hand. The fact that there were 7 of them all individually taking multiple groups of villains, and they manage to land every hit yet not got hit once until late in the final act. Which takes me to the final problem I had with the last act, the deaths weren't at all earned in my opinion. There's a point during the film that you work out that not all of the 7 will survive this, and I think as the film makers, they knew this too. But instead of earning the deaths, they decided to kill of 3 of the 4 known actors and the 1 character that everyone seemed to love. For me it was just bad writing and they could of made us care about their deaths so much more than they did.\nSomething else I really didn't like in the Magnificent 7 was the formation of the team and character developments. In both departments it was extremely poor. There is next to no back story for many of the characters and they get no further interesting story for the rest of the film. This part of the reason these deaths weren't earned. Yes it's ballsy to kill off the highest paid actors but it doesn't make it right. Character development and a stupid D'Onofrio accent really took me out of the film and made me view the 7 as more of a comedy group rather than a group of bandits.\nMagnificent 7 seemed to of taken the Marvel route and had one of the worst villains I have ever seen. He was pointless. Spoiler alert but all he does is make an intimidating speech because his goons are pointing guns at people, kills one guy, then stands back from the town yelling orders til all his troops have been killed, at which point he turns into the weakest whimp of all time. I'm not sure how much of this is to be blamed on the directing or writing, but the actor they cast was simply not up to scratch. They needed an actor that has a presence and can deliver a line in a way that gives intimidation. Instead we got a bumbling guy who we had to believe was one of the most feared people in the country.\nAs I mentioned before, a big positive in this film was the action. Even through the last act on a whole was a major let down, it still was a great spectacle to watch a big western fight. My favourite action sequence though was the first time they team up together in their first fight. I thought that it had the perfect balance of team work mixed in with action. Each character except one got to display their skills and this fight really pumps you up for what the final act can be. Unfortunately that adds to the downfall of the final act being so disappointing for me.\n6/10",

            "content": "Was anyone asking for a remake of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (itself a re-imagined version of SEVEN SAMURAI)?  No.  Is this new version pretty damn entertaining and well-made?  Absolutely.  Perhaps no genre is more inherently cinematic than the western, with the sweeping vistas, horseback riding, and gunfights that are often found therein, and this MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is a vivid illustration of the potentials of the genre.  This is no deconstruction, but rather a nuts and bolts (meat and potatoes?), classical, old-school western that embraces - rather than attempts to \"modernize\" - the staples of the genre.  It is a beautiful film from a visual standpoint, with phenomenal, Oscar-worthy production design, rich cinematography, and convincing, appropriate period costumes.  The titular seven characters are embodied by an excellent cast; much has been said and written about the diversity factor, but at the end of the day, it's just a really eclectic bunch of performers with different energies, something which makes for some really fun chemistry and interplay.  Also noteworthy is the score by the late James Horner and Simon Franglen; theirs was an unusual collaboration (Horner passed away last year having written material based on the screenplay, leaving Franglen to expand those ideas into a full score), but the result is something which Horner fans will instantly recognize as fully at home among his soundscape.  It's wonderful to hear Horner's familiar sound one last time in a big film like this.  It's also worth saying that the climactic confrontation in the movie is full-on, properly thrilling stuff, and is probably second only the CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR's airport fight as the best action sequence of the 2016.  The movie is not perfect, however; there are some tonal inconsistencies at times, as the movie seems to want to be a romp while also making the violence hit home, and these two aims sometimes contradict.  That's a relatively small thing, though, as THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN honors the films that came before it, and succeeds at delivering a satisfying and old fashioned (in a good way) western.",

That being said, I'm probably not the best judge of quality for this one. Since a few are looking forward to my review though, I'm gonna do this anyway. \n\nFor those suffering from superhero movie fatigue following a summer of costumed epics, Director Antoine Fuqua's remake of...another remake, is just what the doctor ordered. Easily the best balls-out action film of the summer by a long shot, there's very little (if any CG) in this old-school western romp. Speaking of old-school, it's been a while since I remember seeing this much old-fashioned badassary in one movie. All the leads are so appropriately over-the-top and in their element at the same time, that favorites become a matter of preference. For me, it's a toss up between Vincent D'onofrio's grizzled, hatchet welding Jack Horne and Ethan Hawke's tortured civil war vet, Goodnight Robicheaux. The latter in particular, as I've never been been a Hawke fan; his battle-weary ex-army captain is a tough match with   D'onofrio's subtle/vicious approach to his own character. Jennifer Lawrence look-alike Haley Bennett is also very impressive as the widower out for vengeance. It's really a given that Denzel Washington is perfectly cast as the leader of this wild bunch, fighting for the spotlight with Starlord himself. Chris Pratt is much better here than he was in Guardians, exuding a time-worn confidence that only a veteran actor can pull off...except he's Chris Pratt (that's the dearest of compliments, btw). Also, Peter Sarsgaard is pitch-perfect as the psychopathic villain, Bogue. Apart from being as good as it is,  it's also the most violent PG-13 rated movie I've ever seen. The blood, bullets, guns and machismo are on full display here. Butter up the popcorn and enjoy. This flick is a doozy.",

All of the actors completely inhabit these roles while also remaining extremely likeable and have distinct personalities, The cinematography is dripping with western grit, the action sequences are amazingly put together and are very intense/ fun to watch. The film was very competent in building character conflict and relationships. The villain was also very well written, they did a good job of making me hate him. \nMy only issues with the film are some scenes felt rather redundant in the second act, the finale dragged a tad to long and something very predictable, cliche and eye roll worthy happened near the end. Overall I had a great time though.\n4/5 Stars",

            "content": "A shot review of the new Magnificent 7.\nIts an okay Western. It aint no classic. Not by a longshot.\nSeven Samurai and John Sturges' Magnifcent Seven will live in the pantheon of great films so long as films are watched and studied.\nThis Mag-1 will be the A-fllm Mag-7 that failed. They had a lot to live up to, and they failed. The other Mag7 sequels were never intended to be anything but a Hollywood paycheck. And they succeeded at that.\nThis film is as ultra violent as the worst of the spaghetti westerns. \nThe talent was there. fine stars put together pretty good seven.But so what? They got dynamite and bows and arrows, and great riflemen and an army of gun men raised by the bad guy in 48 fucking hours, and a big old Gattling gun too, but no story that makes a lick of sense.\nI can also criticize the music. the best of it was audibly derivative of Elmer Bernstein's great score, and the worst of it sucked. What were they thinking? This shit was good? And how dare they not call Denzel Washington's leader \"Chris\"? They even gave him a back story? A 1-line back story to justify all the killing. What the fuck?\nBoys and girls, the point of 7-Sams and Mag-7 was that the warriors had lost the meaning to their lives. The samuraii were ronin and no longer samuraii, which was what they felt part of. The American gunfighters were lost in a changing world, with no need for itinerant gunfighters. All of them. This fight on behalf of poor people was a chance to earn redemption for their souls. Did you miss that? Why do you think they called him Chris, and not Walter ?\nFuqua's film is a paean to killing machines. Men who have\nmastered the art of killing, but they are sort of good guys, so its okay. This is no Seven Samurai. its an okay bloody western. Contrived and silly. Kurosawa would turn his eyes away from Fuqua if he were still alive. As a western its an ok film. At an attempt at a new classic, it sucks. Fuqua has failed.",
