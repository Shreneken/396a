Isolated from society, Ben and Leslie devote their existence to raising their kids -- educating them to think critically, training them to be physically fit and athletic, guiding them in the wild without technology and demonstrating the beauty of co-existing with nature. When Leslie dies suddenly, Ben must take his sheltered offspring into the outside world for the first time.",

However, when their hospitalized mother dies, they are forced to enter the mainstream world and consider the possibility of assimilation.  The subject matter throughout is interesting, the scenery is beautiful, and the script poses many interesting questions, including the most compelling – can we be critical, objective thinkers after being influenced by our parents and community with regards to religious affiliations, political allegiances, social issues, and other moral matters?  If nothing else, Captain Fantastic is sure to spark debate.",

As the movie deals heavily in philosophy, I appreciated that the writers stick to the script in some spots and also poke holes in it in other spots. Philosophy can never be about what is right or what is wrong as it exists in relativity. The film never expects Viggo's character to be anything different than he is and the same goes for the members of his family on the opposite end of the spectrum. It does expect however that they adjust to each other and see the faults in their own beliefs. Moral of the story - people are different and can simultaneously want the best outcomes despite the means of achieving those outcomes being wildly different. That's not to say this movie is perfect. It's not. There are plenty of small annoyances - mostly implications like traditional school, video games, and television make you stupid (scenes with Viggo's sister's kids at their house). But the only truly obtuse part of this movie is its economics. The family may have been able to live off the land for the most part and make enough for everything else by selling knick knacks as is implied at the beginning of the movie...but then when it comes time to drive hundreds of miles and the eldest son to hop on a plane, the film doesn't care to comment except by saying \"stick it to the man\"...what? That cash is coming from father-in-law who is this movie's \"man\" or from thin air.",

The interesting part about the film is how deluded communists are. Not the father, Ben, the deluded writers, producers, and reviewers of this movie. These people fancy themselves to be brilliant philosophers that are a counter-culture to \"the man\" (Christian capitalist society). Ben is rebelling against this society by raising his kids off grid, stealing from grocery stores, killing other peoples livestock, and looking down the stupid peasants that just don't get how crappy it is to live in capitalist society. The irony is, Christian conservatives teach their kids at home. Communists raise their kids in public schools. Christian conservatives teach their kids to live off the land. Communists teach their kids to live off of food stamps, or the wealth of their parents. Christian conservatives have lots of children. Communists abort their children. Christian conservatives live in rural areas. Communists live in Urban ghettos, or gated communities near the coasts. The movie reviews reveal how delusional communists are. They don't read books, they riot, and parrot big lies from the corporate media and the bankers they own them. They aren't against the establishment, they are tools of the establishment. They aren't anti-facsists, they are fascists. They don't love the bill of rights, they ignore the bill of rights. They only thing accurate about Marxists, like Ben, is his narcissism, his irrational hatred of Christians, and his boastful attitude that he is superior to everyone else. This is probably the dumbest movie I have ever seen, in large part because it is so unrealistic. People like Ben exist only in the imaginations of pampered college grads who skimmed parts \"The Communist Manifesto\" and watched lectures about Jean Jaques-Rousseau's \"Discourse on Inequality\" for their political philosophy course in college. This movie is a delusion of grandeur.",

It did paint an idealized view of living off the grid rather than include some of the more mundane issues that would surely arise in daily life, but I felt this was forgivable. The only part I truly take issue with is the decision by Bo at the end to travel to Namibia after he [put (his) finger on a map]. Whilst Namibia is actually a really good fit for him to develop as a young man given his current skill set, I felt this decision should have been the result of careful research by him and his father rather than just made on a whim.

Watching this film provoked questions that inspired, scared and excited me, as well as brilliantly addressing the burdens of capitalism that unknowingly oppress the majority every waking day. The forest scenery is stunning. The city spectacle is honest, tailored to Ross' aesthetic - realistic & gritty. The film puts a spotlight on Ben, the protagonist played by Viggo Mortensen, a once regular guy who grew tired of being the state's puppet. Ben rejected societal obligations and norms by creating his own way of living. Although Ben's parenting style is controversial, Ross persuades the spectator to favour it over the 'normal' parenting styles that the spectator is likely familiar with. One way in which Ross encourages his spectator's to favour Ben's choice of parenting, is by displaying the positive outcomes. One example of this is when when Ben's eight-year-old daughter, played by Shree Crooks, succeeds the knowledge of Harper's children, who represent the modern youth of America. Through this comparison, Ross critique's the impact of technology, unhealthy eating and the education system on the youth of today. Unfortunately, the plot was slightly stretched out, in my opinion, despite the fact that I continued to be fascinated with what was happening on screen at every moment! Watching this film, you will be absorbed into a journey where your vulnerability will reveal itself as your emotions cross different roads. I thoroughly relished in exploring an unpopular ideology, which unlocked my mind, aiding me in the discovery of opinions I wasn't aware that I even held.",

She is bipolar and he keeps her from getting medical help because he knows better than all of modern science, knows how to do quantum physics, and can recite Noam Chomsky on cue. They raise a bunch of children to hate capitalist society, especially Christians. Then despite the husband being right about everything, the wife kills herself due to untreated bipolar disorder. Now the husband must travel across fascist America with his Marxist children to steal his wife's body from her family, cremate it, and flush it down a toilet. The husband makes sure to tell his kids never to lie all the while lying and stealing to get their way. This movie has all the smugness and righteousness of Christian cinema hits like God Is Not Dead 2 and the shallow straw maned characters of a 80s era North Korean propaganda film.

However, looking past the main character was a sense of predictability in most areas. Most of the humour worked well, with not too many jokes that fell entirely flat. The emotional moments of the film varied between being stirring and being formulaic and nauseating.

            "content": "It's often hard to find films that explore parenting with sensitivity and without assigning blame to one parent or another, see Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) also, this is a film that manages to do it. Having seen 28 Hotel Rooms (2012) and having not been particularly impressed I didn't expect much from director Matt Ross coming into this film but he tells a story that feels very personal here and has a sure eye for repressed tensions. Viggo Mortensen seemed to be the main story with this film as he received his second of three nominations for Best Actor for playing the lead role in this film and it's true, he carries the film. This is not a film for those who like very plotty pictures or don't enjoy aggressive but contemplative stories this may be a difficult watch but if you come in prepared for that you will be greeted by a fantastic film.\n\nBen Cash, Viggo Mortensen, is raising his six children as a single father after the suicide of his wife Leslie, Trin Miller, as they live off the grid in the wilderness and learn about revolutionary, liberal politics. Cash and his children must travel into regular society in order to attend their mother's funeral. On their road trip they encounter the positives of civilian life as his eldest son Bodevan, George MacKay, experiences his first relationship and his most rebellious child Rellian, Nicholas Hamilton, questions his authority. He comes into conflict with both his father in law Jack, Frank Langella, and his sister Harper, Kathryn Hahn, and her husband Dave, Steve Zahn, who urge him to give his children normal upbringings. \n\nThe film is very good at presenting both sides of the argument as we see the positives of Cash's way of life, his daughter Zaja, Shree Crooks, can recite the Bill of Rights, but also how he encourages them to shoplift and how they struggle to interact with their peers. You understand the frustrations of Harper and Dave as they attempt to reason with the often fiery and inconsiderate Cash but they also condescend him and in the end come to understand how important Cash was to Leslie. The dinner table scene in which he references how Dave referred to Leslie as a \"bitch\" during their last encounter, it is implied she became overly zealous in a conversation about children eating sugar, displays the differences in the way these people choose to act. At the end of the day Harper and Dave care about Cash and his children and their largest concern is to make their lives better.\n\nMortensen's performance is a large part of why the conflict works as well as he is at once infuriating in his self righteousness but sensitive in his treatment of his children's education. When he fantasizes about his wife we see him tear up and the first hints of a buried vulnerability begins to appear as we know that even he questions his way life despite outwardly broadcasting the idea that he is steadfastly committed to it. He has the usual Academy Award \"commitment\" scene when he appears unnecessarily nude in one scene but other than that the performance is largely without vanity as Mortensen shows he is willing to question the liberal beliefs that he probably holds in real life. \n\nThe young actors playing the children also do a great job as rising star MacKay performs well as the confused young son coming of age. Watching him begin an innocent flirtation with a sweet, experienced young woman and misinterpret her signals completely was lovely as we see him step outside of his father's shadow. The two actors that surprised me most with their nuanced dramatic performances were Hahn and Zahn as the perplexed parents just trying to get along with a difficult relative. The friction between the three characters is made more potent by Hahn's believable reactions and her sudden outburst was shocking and emotional.\n\nI really liked this film, despite Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw's criticism of it, because it offered an interesting analysis of differences in parenting style and featured great performances. It's relatively short and very watchable even if you can't feel sympathy for the main character.",

She must have been really mentally unstable and chemically unbalanced. This hassle great character development and you can see how comfortable everyone is with each other.\n\nThis movie actually has some very funny moments. Like when the cop gets on the bus and they all start singing. It makes it even more clearer how normal it is to hide the detailed truth from our children to protect them when all it really does is confuse them or make them more curious. I like the way that the Grizzly dad has raised his kids not hiding anything from the kids. \n\nThis movie is powerful. It can definitely help to enlighten anyone that watches it. It's so true though.

It's awkward, it's funny; it's quirky, deep and moving -- I don't know how he managed to combine those traits into a film that flows so wonderfully, but Matt Ross' has done it. The entire cast is great and nail their roles as the unique bunch of characters, but I have to give extra credit to Mortensen here who is, as usual, outstanding and brings a certain sensitivity and believability to a complex man when everything he stands for, everything he's taught his kids, is brought into question.

However, the movie becomes burdened by trying really hard to fit in all the little idiosyncrasies of this family's life, so that the story about the characters ends up taking a back seat.  I was also disappointed that any doubts/questions about whether it was right to raise their children this way - as hardcore new age survivalists - seemed to be summarily dealt with rather than being meaningfully explored.  The father and father-in-law relationship was interesting and certainly deserved more exploration.

In fact, there's no rule that says you have to like movies whose budget is over $30 million but unfortunately it's tough for the general public to come across with smaller movies. Therefore, and though these are the more marketable indies, when the Academy nominates films like \"Moonlight\", \"The Lobster\" and \"Captain Fantastic\" they're doing a sort of cultural service. This latter picture is one of the biggest surprises of the year. It's a deeply moving feature film, shot beautifully and acted even more so by everyone involved. It's almost documentary-like in its depiction of this idiosyncratic family, which provides every minute with a sense of real involvement. The only problem that, in my view, ends up spoiling this cinematic endeavor is its lack of confidence in challenging the traditional structure that so brilliantly sets up. Specially in the third act, where it gets mixed and self-contended. Besides that, is an endearing movie that, in its core, is about family and coping with loss which is largely supported by a brisk screenplay. There's one line that specially struck me as it reinforced what I've been thinking: \"Interesting is a non-word. You know you're never allowed to use it. Be specific.\". And that's exactly how I feel. When I'm writing something, whether a paper or a review, I'm completely appalled by the word \"interesting\" as I find it devoid of content. What does that mean, \"interesting\"? It's a word you use when you can't say something either bad or good, it's a safeguard when you're too lazy to actually think about what makes the subject of your attention appealing. So, it's was fantastic to see this movie confirming what I strongly support and I make an appeal to all of you reading to replace \"interesting\" with someone as meaningful as the sense of family bonds in \"Captain Fantastic\". And that's it! My pre-Oscar reviews are done. Sorry, \"Loving\", \"The Red Turtle\" and \"The Lobster\". I'll get to you later...",

He is certain by this ideologies and is flawed because of it. He cut his family off out of the real world, he won't teach them important knowledge but raise them in his own beliefs. This comes around in the film later on and is addressed. \n\nActing wise the children were good. All of the cast were great, there were some scenes that weren't good like when Bens son Justin was angry at him it just didn't seem believable. When he would act it would kind of put me out of the film for moment. George Mackay was excellent in this film, I really enjoyed his performance. Every scene he was in was great. \n\nThe antagonist in this film is the Grandad. When they called about the death Bens wife they told him he isn't allowed to come to the children or he will phone the police. I didn't quite understand this threat because Ben wouldn't have done anything wrong. I figured the Grandfather had something on Ben, something he did. But there was never a reveal. As an antagonist, (apart from not allowing Ben to the funeral) he was one of the most reasonable people in the film. He wanted to bring the children into the real world, put them in school and provide them with a good life.",

The young cast lavishes talent and charisma, with each having its own characteristic and certain depth that allied to his particular talent, gave an air of truth that is impossible not to be enchanted. The dilemmas, pros and cons of such a creation thus come to the fore most sharply with the need for confrontation with established society, with the eldest son's questioning of his lack of \"social tact\" in ordinary situations of young people of his age, and also in his personal growth outside the cell created by Ben. Film of a promising Matt Ross, who does not care to point out the right or wrong, the good the evil .. an impartiality ... but that makes clear the razor wire that is the human being look for his own navel, to the detriment of seek his truth. his reason for being.

Captain Fantastic is about a man named Ben who raises his 6 kids in the forrest in the Pacific Northwest however after his wife dies, they decide to go to her funeral however he has to deal with his kids adjusting with a world outside the environment of the forrest. However the plot to the movie is just so much more than just that because its like a social commentary on life, education, religion, raising a family, etc and I love how different it is. Viggo Mortensen plays the father in this film and he is a revelation in this role this may be his best performance to date. However what really surprised me in this movie was the actors who played the 6 kids because though they are really a supporting part of the movie they are in almost every scene which is a lot of weight to carry but they did great. Also Frank Langella who I find underrated does great in this film as well along with Kathryn Hahn and Steven Zahn. Though I gave this film a perfect score its definitely not for everyone, the film kind of criticizes on how we are under educated and on religion a little because like I said earlier in this review it kind of points out a lot of things about society, but it also makes you think a little and thats what I love about this film. My one main issue with this film is probably towards the end because its just a little bizarre for me but I guess thats what they were aiming for considering the movie itself is bizarre and not necessarily your typical average family film. Captain Fantastic is a smart and different film, I can't really guarantee whether or not you will love this movie, the only reason I gave it five stars is because I appreciate that it was different, so I will say this if you are looking to get out of your comfort zone than I would recommend giving Captain Fantastic a try and see what you think.",

Here we find Viggo Mortensen raising his six children in the woods of the Pacific Northwest and who wouldn't cheer his efforts to strengthen their bodies and minds while avoiding the contamination of capitalism, organized religion, and junk food? The film isn't called \"Captain Fantastic\" for nothing!  But Matt Ross's script (he also directed) gradually forces viewers to confront the possibility that this Super-Dad is actually doing his kids harm by keeping them away from the social world they will eventually have to live in (and exposing them to the truth of adult concepts too soon).  But I'm not so sure - is it either or?  Do we have to endorse the version of reality put forth by Frank Langella (capitalist Christian Grandpa) if we accept the premise that Chomsky-loving Viggo might be over-the-top?  Isn't there a happy medium? (The film seems to conclude that there is - but this outcome seems as much a fantasy - or cop out -- as the extreme outdoors approach taken earlier; how exactly are they supporting themselves?).  Viggo did have a raison d'etre of sorts - his wife had bipolar disorder and he thought living in the woods would help her (but it did not).  The six child actors acquit themselves admirably and almost without any cringeworthy moments (save only for their rendition of Sweet Child O' Mine at the \"funeral\", now a cliché, but one that did remind me of a long-departed dear friend). The film itself is fun and, although balanced precariously on just some exaggerated representations of deeper worldviews, it does succeed as a more thought-provoking version of the usual Hollywood entertainment.  I just wish that Matt Ross would have seen fit to show Viggo (or his kids) having an influence on the larger society (or at least Langella) rather than simply depicting their assimilation - but I guess that would be truly fantastical.",

The parents have passed their ideals to their children, namely socialism (in its various forms) and survivalism. With the former, Ben considers most of western society as being fascist, especially corporate America. With the latter, he figures that no one will or should be there for you, so you better learn how to take care of yourself in all its aspects. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training, know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains and even fractures, and know how to hunt, forage and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. Ben and Leslie have tried to make the children critical thinkers, however within the context of their ideals. Beyond these issues, Ben and Leslie made the decision to live this lifestyle for Leslie's health. Formerly a lawyer, Leslie was diagnosed as bipolar. Ben figures that this disorder started with her post-partum depression with Bo. Even with this lifestyle, Leslie's condition has become progressively worse. Despite not believing in western medicine, Ben, to deal with the illness, has sent Leslie to hospital, one close to Ben's sister, Harper, in Sacramento so that there can be family close by. While in hospital, Leslie is able to commit suicide. Beyond the collective grief, Leslie's act brings out a battle between Ben, and Leslie's father, Jack Bertrang, a wealthy Christian, who not only blames Ben for what happened to Leslie, but believes what he is doing to the children can legally be considered abuse. To be held in their church in New Mexico, Jack takes over the funeral arrangements to his and his complacent wife Abby's Christian morals, against what Ben knows was Leslie's wishes, she who believed in Buddhist philosophies. Although Jack threatens to call the police if Ben shows up to the funeral, he and the children believe it is the latest of their missions to rescue Leslie to honor her last wishes to be cremated as per Buddhist philosophies. This mission not only may bring the divide between Jack and Ben to a head, but may also bring out some long seated issues within the Cash children as they are exposed to commercial America in all its good and bad, and as Bo grows into manhood, he who may have his own ideas of what he should do with the next phase of his life...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Captain Fantastic's thought-provoking themes-and an absorbing starring turn from Viggo Mortensen-add up to an above-average family drama with unexpected twists.\" Alonso Duralde of TheWrap gave the film a positive review, saying \"The movie really belongs to Mortensen, who allows Ben to be exasperating, arrogant and impatient but also warm, loving and caring. He's a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and a passionate defender of his wife's final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes and more with subtlety and grace\". Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying \"Boasting half a dozen impressive youth performances alongside a leading role that takes full advantage of Mortensen's own sensitive, back-to-nature spirit, Captain Fantastic easily ranks among the most polished and relatable of this year's Sundance offerings.\" One of the few negative reviews was from Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian. \"There's a meaty whiff of phoney-baloney in this fatuous and tiresome movie, replete with forced emotional crises and wrong notes, topped off with an excruciatingly unearned, sentimental ending. It's a low-cal version of Peter Weir's 1986 movie The Mosquito Coast, starring someone who is essentially a cross between Charles Manson and Captain von Trapp.\"\n\n\"Captain Fantastic\" is emotional, existential, funny, gripping and sad with the focus on education, parenthood, norms and the difficulties of losing a partner and parent. I think that Viggo Mortensen gives one of his best performances as an actor and he literally becomes Ben in all ways. His portrayal of a devoted father, a leader, a teacher, a loyal and grieving husband with an honest approach to how his kids should grow up is magnificent. It´s a movie that wants you to question the way we live in the western society and what it does to us. To bring out all those questions we have but never really think that much about. At the same time the film is not taking sides, but rather display the different sides both good and bad. The direction is on the spot and director Matt Ross has managed to get excellent performances from all the main actors/actresses and the cinematography is quite beautiful. Ross has also chosen plenty of great songs for the soundtrack that binds together the film. Amongst the songs there´s a lovely version of Guns & Roses \"Sweet Child of Mine\". \"Captain Fantastic\" is a fine piece of film in my point of view.",

In this case his character is a man who firmly believes that modern society is too concerned with money and power and consumption to give his children a wholesome view of life. They live a wild and eccentric life that leaves them well rounded but also outcasts to society. When a family tragedy strikes they are forced to react with the world around them which causes family friction and a questioning of their lives. As said this film exudes heart and a beautiful energy.

Unbelievably precocious children spouting literary and philosophical references right out of the CliffsNotes; a family living off the land in the deep rainforest (good luck growing vegetables with 2 hours of direct sunlight a day for three months a year); somehow affording to drive a pristine school bus cross-country to a funeral; silly male rites of passage; cringe-worthy fireside jam sessions; pre-canned cultural critigues. I don't understand how people found it charming and informative. Rather, I found it somewhat insulting that Ross kept everything at a superficial level and never allowed his characters to have a real, meaningful conversation. The dialog was more like an exercise in combining Sorkinesque sanctimonious one upsmanship with Wes Anderson's preciousness. Not a pleasant combination in my opinion. \n\nHad Ross focused on building a believable life for the family, with all the inherent difficulties (malnutrition, interpersonal conflict, depression, isolation, money worries, broken down vehicles, infected bug bites and unhealed injuries) rather than an impossible neverland with a few minor inconveniences, he might have captured my interest. Instead I was focused on everything that was wrong with his picture. \n\nMaybe I missed the point. Maybe it was supposed to be a farcical send-up of the lefty homeschool crowd. In that case, it also did a poor job, as I didn't find it particularly humorous in its literalness and lack of subtlety. \n\nI'd love to see a similar plot in the hands of a more capable and experienced director - someone who can construct believable dialog and demonstrates a little more restraint. But this is not it.",

The story is about a bohemian/survivalist guy raising his pack of kids almost totally off the grid, and doing one hell of a job at it. These kids are capable of debating the finer points of Trotskyism and slicing your jugular with equal skill and flair. This clan is totally bizarre and at first is easily dismissed as a bunch of nutty hippies, maybe even cult-ish. But as the film progresses, you start to question who is 'right' in how they live their lives. He teaches his children with a disarming candor that is comedic, refreshing, and disturbing at the same time. His bluntness makes the viewer painfully aware of how it's not only normal, but expected to lie or withhold the truth from others... particularly our children, all in the name of social propriety. On the other side of the argument, though his kids are fiercely intelligent and capable, they are completely inept at dealing with modern society at large, or anyone in it. This film has a lot to say about American values and society, but is never judgmental, preachy or manipulative. It just presents both the merits and dangers of conformity in the context of the story and lets the viewer come to his/her own conclusion. The story is intelligent and well-written, and has more layers and goes in different directions than you'd expect. The acting is also great by all parties, and Viggo Mortensen nails it as the paterfamilias (I don't know that his performance is worthy of the Best Actor nod he received, but he's very good). The direction also adds to the themes, giving the scenes in the 'natural' environment a documentary vibe by shooting with a handheld camera, and contrasting that by using a steadicam to film the 'normal' commercial world, which emphasizes its artificiality. There is lots of food for thought here, but there is also enough humor to lighten up the sometimes somber subject matter, and a heaping ton of heart. If nothing else, it will challenge your ideas about parenting. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, or even one of the best, but it definitely makes you think.",

            "content": "There's one reason, and one reason only, for why I wanted to watch this movie.  I love Viggo Mortensen.  I also love Frank Langella and Kathryn Hahn (though they're supporting characters).  Actually, I guess there's FOUR reasons.  Seriously though, I've been on a pretty rotten run of movies lately (one of which was one of the worst movies I've seen in months).  It's been about 9 days since I reviewed a movie that I thought was good (that'd be Catfight) and I just wanted to watch something that I knew would be good.  I mean, I didn't really know that this would be good.  There's always a chance that a movie you think you might enjoy would end up falling short of those expectations, but I digress.  Thankfully, however, this ended up being a really damn good movie in ways that I didn't really expect.  I watched the trailers and I honestly didn't really even know what to expect.  Not saying that they were misleading, but just that they didn't give you the sense of what the film is actually about.  Long story short, the film sees Ben and Leslie move their children away from civilization, where they're taught survivalist skills, philosophy and to be self-dependent.  Leslie, however, has been struggling with depression and Ben thought moving her and the children away from the hectic city life to a more secluded, nature-friendly place would help Leslie with her depression.  It didn't and Leslie is interned in this psychiatric facility in order to get the help she needs.  Ben's father-in-law pays for her stay in the hospital.  Anyway, Leslie kills herself and this is where the film really starts.  The film is about Ben's journey with his children to go to her funeral, despite being prohibited by Leslie's father from attending.  The movie is very interesting in how it explores a variety of different subjects of this family dynamic.  While the way Ben raises his children makes them stronger, more self-reliant, allows for critical thinking without any fear of judgement and, quite frankly, more intelligent than most adults, it also raises questions in whether or not his methods are putting his children in danger.  There are several scenes where you get to see how his teachings and how his approach to parenting leads to one of his daughters finding herself in an incredibly dangerous situation, where she could have been paralyzed or even died.  Regardless of how smart and self-reliant Ben's children are, there's also some sense that he's really not even letting them be children.  Another aspect is the fact that, in spite of what Ben teaches, he just hasn't prepared them for how the real world works.  His oldest son, as an example, struggles to connect with this girl he meets.  He even says that, if it doesn't come from a book, he knows nothing about life.  The film also explores how one of Ben's sons just strives to have some sense of normalcy and how he lashes out in anger when he's frustrated.  It's certainly a very interesting (which is a banned word in this family) approach to tell this story, even if it's not gonna re-invent the wheel, but I like the fact that the movie isn't afraid to take chances with its characters.  Ben isn't portrayed as a perfect father.  I think one of the many themes the film explores is that, how, in part, he has failed his wife and his children in not trying to find a balance between teaching them to be self-reliant and knowing how the world actually works.  But there's also the other side of the equation and that is Leslie's family and their complete disregard and disrespect for her wishes upon her death.  Leslie was a Buddhist, she abhorred all forms of organized religion and how she wished to be cremated and flushed down the toilet.  So, Leslie's father and mother, not giving one ounce of a shit, gave her a Christian funeral and burial anyway.  This is when Ben and his children show up to crash the funeral, as it were, which is a completely depressing and solemn affair.  Ben gives a speech completely tearing apart this funeral and how this is a complete show of disrespect towards what Leslie would have wanted.  Leslie's father is outraged, even though he's the one who's really fucking up by not honoring his deceased daughter's wishes.  This sets off another element of the film, which sees Ben and his father-in-law fight over what is best for the children.  Eventually, when Ben sees the dangers he is exposing his children to, he decides to leave them with their grandfather.  Things don't go as planned, obviously, and the kids sneaked back into the bus.  This is when they decide to dig up their mother's coffin and give her the proper ceremony she wished for.  And, honestly, this scene is just downright lovely.  It might have felt a little sentimental, but I thought it worked because it celebrated Leslie's life instead of the way she died, the family sang her favorite song (Sweet Child O' Mine) and danced.  The contrast between this scene and the Christian funeral she was given was obvious.  And, when I go, I think this is really the best way to go about it.  Celebrate my life and not how it ended.  Laugh, smile, sing and dance.  The casting of this film is fantastic.  Viggo Mortensen is phenomenal, as he typically is.  The children are all fantastic as well and their chemistry is top-notch.  The writing finds some new little twists and a fresh perspective in the typical family-drama dynamic.  I don't know if I can say that all of this adds to a great movie, though.  Don't get me wrong, if this isn't great, then it's about as close as you can get to it without actually being great.  Don't let the fact that I don't think it ever reaches real greatness dissuade you from watching this.  I'd highly recommend this movie, there's very little, if anything, to dislike about this movie.  Very good stuff right here.",

Essentially, it's not going to be recognized by the masses, at least in the beginning of it's lifetime. Captain Fantastic could not be any more indie if it tried: it's attack on what is considered conventional behavior, and an attack on America's own vanity. Ben (Viggo Mortensen) has been raising his kids with his wife in the wilderness for a decade, shielding them from the media that younger generations are exposed to. In turn, they're all incredibly well-read with Olympian bodies and a raw outlook on life. Viggo Mortensen's bravura is entrancing, and the children are all excellent as well. With sweeping vistas of northwest America and a stunning soundtrack, it's also a technical achievement. The ideals presented here made me question my own ways of life, and these are the most valuable kinds of films. Captain Fantastic is a beautiful and sobering film that made me laugh and cry at the same time, and I'm so thankful that it was made.",

He teaches them how to hunt and survive on their own in the wilderness. He educates and home schools all of them, and because of it they can criticize literature, cite history, and even speak 6 languages. The oldest son has offers from all the top universities in the country. When their mother commits suicide, they must migrate to the city and face the real world. \n\nAs they journey through civilization, the children have to interact with the world, and are exposed to modern elements, technology and things they do not understand. Ben is completely open and does not even hide or sugar coat anything to his children even if it regards sex, death, suicide, or simply drinking wine under age. Their aunt challenges him and says they belong in a modern school, he proves her otherwise as they can recite more than either of her sons. What is clearly lacking is the sense of communication and interaction. This is demonstrated the oldest son first interacts with a girl and has no idea what to do. At one point is Ben's method of raising his children truly superior and borders on what many others would consider to be child abuse. When two of his children suffer injuries and his parents grandfather question his tactics, he truly begins to question his own parenting methods. \n\nCaptain Fantastic is an intriguing film that is original and has an independent and non-Hollywood driven feel to it. The film stars off by wowing you with the way the children behave and you are impressed by their knowledge. The comparisons and shots it takes at the modern education system, and religion indeed have some relevance. The film also comments on the obesity of children and the status of healthcare. Had the film pressed on these more and brought more of light to these issues would have made the film more compelling. Mortensen's performance which is academy nominated is worth watching as he does help drive would have been a dreadfully boring film. He shows a complete range emotion and you feel for him and his children and get the sense he does care for his children, but many sometimes get in his own way. It is a tough film to recommend and Captain Fantastic will not sit well with most audiences, and I too wished the film had a bit more to offer. \n\n-3.8.2017",

            "content": "\"Fantastic Captain\" is one of those movies that are fun to watch, it's fun, it's funny, it's almost an adventure, and even then, it's complex and it deals with controversial themes and taboos, all sarcastic and half-hearted. The film is about a subject that documentary channels love to explore, a family that prefers to live in the jungle, away from the pleasures or not of the city, but cool, is the way the script approaches the film, the family in question is The one of Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and its 6 children, that after receiving the news of the death of the mother, decide to go to the funeral of the same, and in the mean time, diverse questions are put, twists, dramas and comedies they happen. It is a simple but beautifully crafted script that explores the contemplation of images to form its background. The film is placed in an ideological position, and it rests on it, I will not talk about this part because it does not attract me, your message to me is about the union of the family, and the power that it acquires by being together, battling and overcoming challenges, And of course, we have a criticism of the traditional teaching method, because Well proves that the education given at home can overcome that of a school because it treats the individuality of each student. With a clean photograph and a strong color palette, camera angles that in moments explore contemplation, a beautiful costumes and a great rhythm, \"Fantastic Captain\" is not a technically exquisite, but very good. In terms of acting the film presents us with Viggo Mortensen who does a first class performance, he is loving and brutal, violent and worried, Viggo conveys spectacularly all the doubts and questions about whether what his character is doing. Another highlight is for George Mackay who is quite stunning as Bem's eldest son, and deserved at the very least to be among the preselected oscar as a supporting actor. Matt Ross, who has always been a serial actor, and has never been featured as an actor, now gets his spotlight on his first job as a director, let's keep an eye on what's coming from Matt. Finally, \"Fantastic Captain\" is not a prime, but it is a film that manages to entertain and pass on a message, like a good script and great performances.",

It is one of my favorite films of 2016 and is completely underrepresented at the Oscars.  It strikes a good balance of comedy, drama, impressive acting, beautiful scenery, and a moral about the importance of family.  I found its tone to be reminiscent of \"Little Miss Sunshine.\"  You may think that it's because the story centers around a slightly dysfunctional family on a road trip, but it comes mostly from the themes of family sticking together through the tough times.  The family dynamic is deep and real.  The interactions amongst the kids as well as their interactions with their father feel so legitimate that you'll forget that they are actors until you sit down to write a movie review (speaking from personal experience).  Viggo Mortensen gives the performance of his career with a broad array of emotions as well as strong chemistry with every character surrounding him.  The remainder of the cast is rounded out by talented child actors an ensemble of character actors including Steve Zahn, Kathryn Hahn, and Frank Langella.  All of the quirky characters are the brainchild of Writer/Director Matt Ross.  I would've loved to see his screenplay get an Oscar nomination if not for the neverending stream of unnecessary f-words.  These cheapen the heartwarming story of family and standing up for what you believe in.  Without the profanity (and more of Viggo than we ever needed to see), this would have made a great PG-13 film that parents and teens could enjoy together.  \"Captain Fantastic\" is a highly entertaining story filled with great acting and a strong moral as long as you can get past all of the f-words.  I wish that more of 2016's Oscar films could have found this balance between drama and comic relief.",

The plot - by first time writer/director, and tv actor Matt Ross in his very first big league Hollywood movie - cocoons the Cash family sans mother/wife Leslie (portrayed in hallucinations by Trin Millers) living their lives off the grid, in the isolated outback of Washington (nature and wilderness scenes captured beautifully by Ross).  Where the family - including  5 year old Nai - learn to kill animals/deer for food; where they live in a cool,  hand constructed, fort-like structure; where the kids are homeschooled like \"philosopher kings\" taught Mao, Stalin, Trotsky, Plato and Chomsky. \n\nThought provoking ideas, commentary and character activity of the Cash clan plays out through an absorbing performance by Best-Actor nominated Viggo Mortensen as father/leader Ben as well as a cast of 6 terrific child/teen actors including George MacKay (last seen in Pride), Annalise Basso (Oculus, Ouija: Origin of Evil), Samantha Isler (with such a gorgeous alt-indie voice) et al.  \nIt's an existentialist family re-origin adventure that harks back to actions and behaviors of Native American pioneers living off the land, adopting an anti-modern, non-consumerist lifestyle with minimal ecological damaging footprints.\nAs the Wikipedia synopsis shares:\n\n\"Ben and Leslie are disillusioned with capitalism and American life, and chose to instill survivalist skills, left wing politics, and philosophy in their children - educating them to think critically, training them to be self-reliant, physically fit and athletic, guiding them without technology, demonstrating the beauty of coexisting with nature and celebrating \"Noam Chomsky Day\" instead of Christmas.\"\nTheir life gets thrown for a loop when Leslie Cash dies, and the family has to LITERALLY jump on a converted school bus to travel to New Mexico to be \"funeral\"crashers after being denied access and inclusion by Leslie's rich father Jack, played with monosyllabic baritone gruff by Frank Langella.\n\nThe Cash's bus roadtrippin' through different States, as well as through big city civilization, captures with widescreen panorama the scenicness of barely touched natural landscapes juxtaposed with manmade, concrete jungles that our human presence has not only constructed but demanded in order to support our unstoppable consumeristic and manufactured existences.\n\nA food-for-thought movie from beginning to end, Captain America stimulates us to envision living in a compromising, new world / old world mashed-up existence where one foot is firmly planted in the nourishing expansiveness of nature (from biological, psychological, and sustenance influences) and the other moored to present-day, contemporary advancement and subsistence.",

You put this or Manchester by the Sea in front of me to watch....10 out of 10 times I'd watch this.\n\nHere's the premise: \"Deep in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, isolated from society, a devoted father (Viggo Mortensen) dedicates his life to transforming his six young children into extraordinary adults. But when a tragedy strikes the family, they are forced to leave this self-created paradise and begin a journey into the outside world that challenges his idea of what it means to be a parent and brings into question everything he's taught them.\"\n\nIt's a thought provoking premise...teaching your children to be the best of the best...the most well educated, introspective children...able to survive on their own...kill a deer, no problemo...scale a wall, easy peasy...but what happens when your actual universe is limited to your family?  It's brilliant and whipsaws your thoughts from \"this is awesome, I wish I could have lived like this\" to \"wtf...they have no clue of the real world.\"  But is the success in the \"real\" world really something to strive for?  Is it something that makes you happy?  Without real world skills, are you really guiding your children to ultimate happiness?  All good stuff.\n\nThe performances here are good.  Viggo Mortenson is excellent as usual.  He plays the introspective understated character better than almost anyone.  He's up for an Oscar for his role here.\n\nI can't imagine anyone not liking this movie.  It has heart...and thought...and beauty.  It has one of the best closing 15 minutes of any movie this past year.  If you have Amazon Prime, it's like $6.  Well worth it.   I'm a fan...see it.",

When he learns that his hospitalized wife has committed suicide, Ben takes his kids into the city, which is met to much criticism from his in-laws.\n\nI'll start off by saying that Captain Fantastic is a very original movie. The idea of a family successfully living in the wilderness for years is baffling, and the results are clearly different from the city folk. His children are raised to think critically, stay in shape, and learn survival skills, but their social skills suffer greatly. I really enjoyed all of the earlier scenes in the wilderness, capturing the sounds and beauty of nature, while the cities felt mysterious by comparison through the children's eyes. The standout of this movie is Viggo Mortensen. His moral fiber as a father is attacked, and we see his internal struggle first-hand. The children also give good performances as they seem to have great chemistry with one another and Viggo.\n\nWhile I did enjoy this movie, I have to admit that it seems a little ridiculous. The family has a lot of ideals about how the world doesn't work, but the kids almost immediately discard those thoughts in favor of living in society and receiving a normal education. Also, it's a bit odd that a family of seven can live out in the wilderness for years without ever being discovered or needing to venture into the cities for any resources.\n\nI must reiterate that I did enjoy Captain Fantastic. It's an original and emotional movie filled with drama and subtle humor. However, the lack of reality is obvious, though it's easy to ignore thanks to Viggo. If the premise intrigues you, go watch Captain Fantastic!\n\nFinal grade: B\n\n-Ben",

I found it intelligent, engaging and a thoroughly satifying watch.",

            "content": "A quirky little indie film about a man named Ben (Viggo Mortensen) who along with his wife is raising their six children in the wilds of the Northwest Pacific. The kids are extremely fit, know how to hunt, are grades beyond their level in education, but know little of social skills in the \"outside\" world. Ben has created a world for them to run away from the outside world where theres cell phones, televisions, bad food and politics. After a tragic event happens Ben takes the kids and journeys to the city to confront his wife's parents and to fully realize what exactly is best for his children. The movie looks good. It's shot really well and there's a great use of colors especially later in the film that show the difference with the family compared to everyone else. Mortensen shines as the lead actor in the film and is believable as some sort of hippie living out in the wild, but a very strong and protective father figure. The kids all have great personalities of their own and present the questions of why? Why do they do this? Why don't they live a seemingly \"normal\" life? It's a film with a lot of heart that I enjoyed. The gripes I had with it are that its second act is a little slow and I felt like the very last half happens a little too quick. Ben makes a decision and its resolved literally 5 minutes later. I would have liked it to be a bit more dramatic for those moments. Overall, definitely worth a rent if it sounds interesting to ya!",

It delivers a beautiful message, it has a delightful cast (the kids are just amazing), with Viggo Mortensen stepping up his game (Oscar, please?) and an adventure-full story that still manages to end on a very bright note.\n\nFull SPOILER-FREE Review @ http://wp.me/p7N9MN-JO\nRating: A",

Everyone from the veteran actors to the children just starting out are amazing in this movie. The screenplay is stellar, the cinematography is solid, the direction is oscar worthy and Viggo Mortensen hasn't done a movie this good since Lord of The Rings. The movie basically blows your mind in every way which is exactly why I'm giving Captain Fantastic a 10/10.",
