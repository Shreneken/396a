Filled with amazing chemistry and heartfelt performances the whole way. the cinematography is filled with shaky cam, close ups and intimate shots for the first half and does a great job of making you feel like your there in the room with them, not just an observer. Than the second half feels much more refined with its shots and you feel more like an observer which works perfectly. The music is very good used at the right times and builds emotion very well. The editing is phenomenal as this feels like a thriller in the first half and drama in the second which is such a unique combination that works perfectly. The pacing is very well done, the only complain is sometimes in the second half shots can drag a little bit longer than they should it feels like sometimes. But besides that, this is without a question an All Time Classic.",

            "content": "That review summary may sound very oxymoronic, but to me it applies to a film such as 'Room'. A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under.\n\nWhat could have easily have been told in a lurid, gratuitous way (being inspired by the true-life case of Josef Fritzl) is instead told in a careful and restrained way. There is even an innocence in 'Room', due to its very fascinating decision to tell it from the viewpoint of a five year old, in this case Jack, one that comes off very movingly and gives a sense that there is a little ray of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. The source material, equally brilliant, is to be thanked here, its author Emily Donoghue adapts it to screen here and none of its power is lost.\n\nReally appreciated the careful and restrained approach to the storytelling in 'Room', and for me and many others it was something different considering the subject. It does though affect some of the pacing in the middle act, where a little of the tension seen in especially the first part is lost a little.\n\nFor my tastes too, though it probably did fit the film's younger and more innocent viewpoint it's told from, the music score does lay it on too thick with the treacle.\n\nHowever, loved how the story was told and its approach. What 'Room' also strongly benefitted from being told this way was that the mother and son relationship was able to shine through and really resonate, which it may not have done as effectively with a heavier tone. And shine through it does, with great charm and poignancy. Also appreciated that none of the characters were painted too black and white, even Old Nick.\n\nProduction values are effectively claustrophobic and the nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish. 'Room' is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked, how mother and son bonds do in dire situations do and the ability to combine both to ensure a powerful experience. A directing job that's both unsettling and empathetic. Similarly 'Room' is written with effortless skill and deft thoughtfulness.\n\nCan't find anything to fault the performances. The superb one of Brie Larson, that was a very worthy Oscar (Golden Globe and Bafta too) win in her category, is an obvious starting point, but one mustn't overlook the beyond-his-years turn of young Jacob Tremblay, one of the best child acting performances in recent years, and William H Macy and Joan Allen both giving some of their best work in years. Sean Bridgers also gives much more to what could have been a standard cliché role.\n\nOverall, great powerful film but the somewhat fascinatingly unconventional (for the genre) way the story was told won't work for some. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Such unspeakable crime can be committed only by the most perverted individuals. As a result of this highly emotionally charged issue, \"Room\" is highly engaging. Towards the middle of the film, I find every cell in me wants the woman's plan to succeed. I held my breath, I welled up and I sincerely hope there would be some humanity left in the world. Another very emotional scene is the brief TV interview. The interviewer seems so caring and empathic, but asks very biased questions which leads to another emotional zenith. This film depicts the horror of captivity, which I am sure doesn't even match the true abuse and desperation that the victims face.\n\nI hope the victims can recover and lead fulfilling lives.",

            "content": "Whilst the premise was unique, the plot didn't feel believable and was largely predictable. The main character was kept in a glorified garden shed in the suburbs rather than some remote location and somehow nobody heard her screaming at any point, she only attempted to escape once, none of the neighbours thought it was weird that the house owner regularly slept in his shed, and neither of the main characters ever got ill enough that they needed medical attention despite living in a tiny room with mice and no sunlight. Furthermore, the guy fell for the 'my son's dead' trick and didn't check that he actually was dead, allowing him to escape. Why would he risk that? The other issue with the plot and pacing was that the second half felt a bit lost. However, the main characters, especially the boy, were quite well thought out. The rest of the characters never got that much development. For example, the main character's dad could have had more of a role in the film. The acting was solid, with a very impressive performance from Jacob Tremblay, even if his voice was frankly annoying. There was also a decent amount of emotion, although the suicide attempt was predictable. Then the cinematography, visual effects, and soundtrack were well executed.",

            "content": "From ‘Room' to the outside world \n\nRoom is a movie directed by Lenny Abrahamson. The film is based on a book written by Emma Donoghue. The lead roles are portrayed by Jacob Tremblay Brie Larson, Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. The author is inspired by a true story related to Elisabeth Fritzl. She was locked up in a cellar for 24 years by his father, Jozef Fritzl. She was sexually assaulted and gave birth to seven children. The movie differs slightly from the true story. In the film, the relationship of the kidnapper with the main character namely Joy is not clear. This film really impressed me literally and figuratively speaking. I can compare this film with the other film namely \"3096 years (also based on true story)\" which also had to do with kidnapping. \n\nThe whole story revolves around two people, Jack and Joy. Joy, the mother who lives in a room with her son. She had been kidnapped by a man named Old Nick seven years ago and locked up in a room ever since. Joy is regularly sexually abused by him. She gives birth to a child namely Jack. For him the room is the world and outside the room the space. His mother tells him all kinds of stories, stories that have nothing to do with the real world. Which later causes a problem, because when Jack is 5 years old, she wants to tell him what happened to her but he doesn't believe her mother. Finally, she can convince Jack that behind these walls lies another world that is much more beautiful than this one. And so she tries to convince him to escape from this room. \n\n \nJacob Tremblay's acting as Jack was impressive, enchanting and nice to see. How he acts as someone for whom the room is the world. The material such as chairs, sink, .. etc was real and the world behind the TV screen was not real. How he looks at the world he doesn't know. That was done so perfectly by him. Brie Larson as a mother / victim, her acting was so realistic. When they consider his child's upset as something normal. She tries to keep Jack in touch with the outside world when they are liberated. \n\n \nIn the film I was looking for certain elements such as flashback and the relationship between the kidnapper and the victim, Joy Newsome. Why flashback? When the mother tells his child how she got into this room, I would have liked a flashback to get a better picture of the happening. It's still not clear to me who Old Nick, the kidnapper was. Was he a stranger, neighbor, or someone from the victim's family? Why I am now asking this question is because the film is based on a true story where the abductor and the victim clearly had a relationship. \n\nThe film has a heartbreaking story, the story that is not a fantasy but is the truth, which is almost unbelievable. In this peaceful world, there are also monsters that cause unrest. In this film, there are also messages that convey the following, never give up, and there is always an end to evil. The film is a must for those who find true stories interesting or films based on the true story. \n\n \"Closed in a room, my imagination becomes the universe, and the rest of the world is missing out\" (Criss Jami).",

            "content": "The movie tells the story of Jack and his mom Joy who live in a 10 by 10 ft. shed they call \"Room\". Joy has been held captive for seven years by an abductor named Old Nick, also known as Jack's biological father. Joy takes care of Jack alone and never lets Old Nick come close to him. Joy hides Jack inside the wardrobe every time Old Nick comes to the shed to sexually assault her. She teaches Jack that only the things inside \"Room\" are real, and the rest happens only on television. Not long after Jack's fifth birthday, Joy learns that Old Nick has lost his job and is unable to provide for them. She decides to teach Jack about the real world. However, Jack cannot understand and becomes frustrated towards Joy. After a while, he eventually begins to learn and identify what is real and what is not. After having the electricity and heat cut off one night, Joy takes the opportunity and helps Jack to fake a fever but Old Nick refuses to take him to the hospital. Joy tries once again by faking Jack's death and folds him in a rug. Old Nick reluctantly agrees to bury him somewhere. While Old Nick drives, Jack follows the instructions given by Joy and successfully jumps out of the truck and calls for help from a passerby. The police come to the rescue soon after and figure out the location of \"Room\". Joy finally gets out of the shed and reunites with Jack and her parents whom she hasn't seen for years. She then finds out about her parents' divorce and struggles with depression. Joy attempts to commit suicide but is sent to the hospital when Jack discovers her in the bathroom. During Joy's absence, Jack becomes adjusted to the new world as he slowly comes out of his shell. He decides to cut his hair (which he considers his \"strong\") and sends it to his mom so that she can have strength to overcome her struggles. Joy finally returns home and Jack suggests that they revisit \"Room\". They return to the shed and Jack says goodbye to each object in \"Room\". They walk out and smile as they begin their new journey.  \n\nWhile it may be difficult for the audience to relate to the actual situation, there exist several themes and meanings behind the story of Joy and Jack that each can learn from. By looking at Joy, one can recognize the beautiful qualities of a mother. In several scenes, we sense Joy's great despair and hopelessness, but she always hides them in front of her son. She tries to stay optimistic for Jack and does her best to protect him from Old Nick. Her sacrifices, unconditional love and care for Jack are perfect symbols of motherhood. \n\nEven though Joy takes care of Jack and protects him, Jack, in a different sense, also protects Joy and gives her the strength and hope she needs in order to survive. Moreover, Jack is the one that makes the escape possible. There is a famous quote by John Donne, \"No man is an island, entire of itself.\" The movie supports this quote perfectly and shows that we are never alone and that we are meant to help one another along the way in life.\n\nThere also exist two interesting themes that contrast with each other: freedom and exploration. Leaving \"Room\" has a completely different meaning to Joy and to Jack. To Joy, it means to be free and to be back into her comfort zone while to Jack, who knows nothing outside \"Room\", leaving it means to step out of his comfort zone to explore the unknown. Though we may not be physically stuck inside a room, there may come a time in our life when we feel stuck in a situation or in a relationship. Regardless of what \"Room\" may be to us, the film teaches us to let ourselves be free and to explore for the world is so big and there is so much to see. \n\nI strongly recommend this movie as it is one that makes you ponder and reflect on your own life. It gives hope and comfort to all those who are going through difficult times. From the beginning to the very end, we can witness the changes and the growth of each character. It is not just a fairy tale with a superhero coming to the rescue, but a realistic portrayal of all the ups and downs we go through in life and the emotions and feelings that we may experience when facing fears and challenges. The film touches hearts and gives strength. It motivates the audience to set themselves free from fear or past pains and to explore the big world out there.",

His finite universe extends as far as the four walls, the ceiling, and the floor, the only view of the outside world coming from a small skylight in the ceiling.  He is taught that all things in the natural world outside of the room are fictions created by the television.  To say more would be to say too much.  The film is disorienting, suspenseful, tragic, thought-provoking and, ultimately, inspirational.  Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are outstanding as mother and son.  Watch this movie.",

Sentimentality is the key to this film. A trait we all hold dear in our day to day lives, a theme we can all personally relate to which I think is the films strongest point as we can all feel a deep sense of empathy for each character within each scene. This film moved me in ways few others have, and I promise it will move you, regardless of who you are or if you're heartless this film will imprint itself. Struggling to find a flaw within the film itself, stellar acting from Brie Larson, I look forward to her future projects.",

Her acting felt so real that I could relate so much of a similar person with similar emotions of distress.\n\nThe shooting done is the Room was very smart, they captured the essence pretty well. Even in later house, the close door cinematography was done with great angles of stairs.\n\nIts the little things that I loved, learning to walk down the stairs, world outside being TV, the attention to details. Movie starts with Goodmorning and ends with Bye Bye.\nThe thrill that was involved in the escape sequence was perfect.\n\nI love that they didn't waste time on things that I thought they would, 'oh whole 2hr movie is ganna take place in a Room... nope' , 'oh the other half will be about finding the Ma... nope' realistic use of Satallite to find the truck, fabulous writing of 3 Stop Sign. The movie was grounded in reality, hence I love it so much.\n\nThe characters had great progression, she would definitely have this kind of reaction given the trauma of being 'Thankful' to others. Her trying her best for the child, breastfeeding till 5 years and understanding she isn't a good Ma, but still HIS Ma.\n\nIdea of long hair being Strength and the whole outside World being TV, beauty of storytelling.",

Desde que empieza la película te estás preguntando qué es lo que pasará y te sientes sofocado por el poco espacio y por el diseño de producción. (Que es muy bueno)\nTranscurriendo el primer acto yo ya me había estresado y por poco la dejaba de ver de lo buena que está filmada esta y de lo envolvente que es. Las actuaciones son impecables,  Brie Larson se merece el Oscar de mejor actriz porque en ningún momento se sale de su personaje y puedes sentir empatía por lo que le está pasando y de la culpabilidad que ella siente al recordar lo que hiso en el cuarto. La actuación de Jacob Tremblay es increíble también; son los actores los que hacen que esperes el \"basado en hechos reales\" al final, porque te hacen ver que esto pudo haber sido es real, y cuando no ves ese letrero al final te quedas con la satisfacción de que viste una buena película con muy buenas actuaciones. \n Esta película me destruía me soltaba y me volvía a destruir con cada giro que daba, y eso fue lo que hiso que no la disfrutara del todo, el estar preocupado por lo que pasará, tanto así que no me pude concentrar en el presente, y esa sensación de solo poder relajarme cuando empezaran los créditos no es placentera. \nCerca de la mitad del segundo acto, me estaba preguntando porque la película no había acabado ya, si ya habían cerrado todas las tramas, pero no, tenían que seguir haciéndome sufrir con una segunda trama que se desencadenaba de la primera. (Aclaro que no estoy diciendo que fue innecesaria, al contrario, está fue lo que necesitaba para finalizar con la película por completo. La razón por la que sufrí fue por el aura tan tensionante que ya explique antes)\nEn conclusión esta película está hecha para sacar los peores pensamientos de la gente (así fue conmigo y ninguna otra película lo había logrado hasta ahora), el diseño de producción y las actuaciones son impecables.",

Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical--they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has euphemistically named Room. Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world. \n\n\nAnalysis of the caracters \n\n1)\nJack's 5th birthdayall takes place within 'Room' where he lives since he Washington born: a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life . Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' unreal.\n2)\nMa is a young woman in her mid-twenties. She has a son named Jack, who is the result of a forced sexual encounter with Old Nick. While in \"Room,\" Ma provides a relatively safe atmosphere for her son, Jack, putting his well-being before her own. As a result, Ma has a painful, rotting tooth for which she can get no treatment. She sometimes becomes quiet and retreats into herself, though most of the time she is able to put on a brave face for her son. However, Ma suffers from depression and suicidal thoughts and even tries to kill herself. She is clearly and understandably psychologically damaged by her trauma, but her love for Jack is strong and unbreakable.\n\n\n",

            "content": "I'm not the biggest fan of Brie Larson so I am not thrilled with the fact that she has a Best Actress Academy Award when the far more talented Judy Davis, Barbara Hershey and Eleanor Parker do not. I was pleasantly surprised by her performance in this film, although I do not think she is a patch on Charlotte Rampling in 45 Years (2015). The film as a whole is a decent little film that focuses on an emotionally heart wrenching experience and it's effect on the lives of what seem like very natural, realistic characters but it was hardly one of the best of 2015 and there are unfortunate weaknesses that the film's screenplay gives into.\n\nIn a small locked shed, Joy Newsome, Brie Larson, lives with her son Jack, Jacob Tremblay, because she is trapped by Old Nick, Sean Bridgers, the man who kidnapped her seven years previously and is the father of her son. When conditions begin to significantly worsen and Joy realizes her son is becoming more mature she begins to look for ways to escape. After devising a clever scheme involving her son faking his own death she is able to escape the room and is reunited with her mother Nancy, Joan Allen, who now lives with a new partner Leo, Tom McCamus. Joy struggles to adapt to normal life in the outside and after being asked an invasive question during an interview she attempts suicide. Eventually she is able to move past her trauma as her son becomes more comfortable with his new lifestyle and the two say goodbye to the room forever.\n\nThe opening scenes of the film are very good at setting up the abject horror of the situation that this very regular woman and her sweet young son are trapped in. It is hard not to feel sympathy for these people as you watch an innocent little boy struggle to comprehend what a man who is the closest thing he has to a father figure is doing to his mother. The film loses me slightly when the two leave the room as while I think Allen and McCamus are two fine actors I found that their characters were not used very well and the use of suicide just seemed a tad too much in a film that benefited from it's restraint in telling a difficult story. I felt a little sad as the film began to lose me because it set up such great expectations from it's beginnings but it struggles to smoothly transition to an uneven second half.\n\nWe see interviews that turn into interrogations, Joy's suicide attempt and her son trying to acclimate to his new environment with the help of his stepfather. I didn't need all of this to be thrown at me immediately and I think that Larson's performance erred the most here as she failed to carry a lesser screenplay through the end of the film. I wanted to see more of Allen and McCamus although their use in small doses probably benefits them because they feel like the realest characters in the film. Tremblay was grating at certain points for me and I could have used less of his voice over which seemed like a very obvious attempt to emotionally manipulate the audience. The best scenes come when Allen and Larson argue, they feel very Terms of Endearment (1983) and yet they were the most appealing and relatable moments in the film because they borrow some of the warmth and intelligence that the 1983 film has in spades.\n\nI am rather shocked that this film managed to get a Best Picture nomination in a year that boasted The Lobster (2015), Carol (2015) and of course 45 Years. I can see why Larson received recognition and the screenplay has some bright spots but overall it's hardly a great film and certainly not one of the best of the year. The film is worth a viewing but it may not be emotionally effecting enough for the crowd looking for a decent weepie and it's not intelligent enough in it's examination of it's subject matter for a more cynical audience. On the whole a mediocre effort from a group of fairly talented people.",

            "content": "Room provides harrowing trauma and cathartic release.\n\nLenny Abrahamson's Room (2015) is a indie drama of massive heart and daunting terror. It is a bottle film with the majority shot in a single room, but Room creates an endlessly imaginative space for its actors and actresses to perform. Emma Donaghue's writing is adapted from her own novel with a stylish realism and incomparable thoughtfulness.\n\nDirector Lenny Abrahamson uses tight spaces to build suspense with a sense of frustration, anger, fear, and claustrophobia. He effortlessly invents new ways to shoot in a single set to constantly keep things interesting for the viewer. Room is beautifully directed and shot with intimate close-ups of tender moments between a captive mother and her son. Danny Cohen's cinematography ranges from creepy and horrifying to frightened and loving. The use of blue is quite affecting and magical in Room.\n\nEvery emotion is captured within Room as this film takes the world out of you trapping you in this tiny space with the cast and characters. With a run time of less than two hours, the film is not that long, but it feels like 3 hours. This is actually a fantastic thing for 2 reasons.\n\nFirst, Room takes the time to flesh out its characters with tremendous depth and agony alike. You are witnessing their elongated captivity and innovative coping methods.\n\nSecondly, Room bravely goes a step further than a story of captives, but dives into the perilous uncertain waters of survival after trauma. Room continues into their rehabilitation and into their reintegration back into society and the eternal struggle of those attempting to reclaim their lives and happiness after traumatic events.\n\nAbrahamson crafted a dynamic of trust through his use of tender quiet space is impressive. Stephen Rennicks composed an astonishingly lovely score that just mesmerized me throughout Room's entire running time. I was not expecting such a stunning sympathy of empathy and understanding.\n\nRoom gifted us with dual magnificent acting roles for Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. \n\nNotably, Brie Larson is resplendent as Joy \"Ma\" Newsome. Her leading actress role is a true tour de force of human emotional range. Larson portrays a kidnapped woman with a clear understanding and respect for the female victims of sexual assault and rape. Her depiction of motherhood with all its joys, frustrations, fears, rage, patience, and kindness is remarkable unto itself. But, when you pit parenting against forced confinement, Larson evolves the role into a complex display of brave resistance that I found profoundly moving. Brie Larson encapsulated a brilliant dramatic performance for the ages in Room. I hope to see more affecting dramatic roles from Larson in the near future.\n\nSimilarly, Jacob Tremblay gives one of the finest performances from a child actor as Jack in Room. His nervous and indignant reactions to his constraint against his will is gripping. Tremblay displays a fervor for acting that I anticipate seeing again in his upcoming roles.\n\nLastly, Room features a few neat supporting roles. Sean Bridgers is creepy, unsettling, and disgusting as the rapist kidnapper Old Nick. William H. Macy has a heartfelt infuriating role as a disappointed and awkward father to Larson. On the other hand, Tom McCamus is excellent as the kindly father figure to Joy and the gentle grandfather figure to Jack. Finally, Joan Allen delivers a shocking performance as Joy's mother with a surprising level of authenticity and brutal honesty.\n\nIn all, Room is a harrowing experience to endure, but rewarding with its hopeful ending. The catharsis I felt by the finale of Room is something akin to euphoria and relief. Room is easily one of the greatest films ever made.",

            "content": "- Pain can't be confined to one Room -\n\nWarning:  This film and article contain references to explicit sexual content\n\nAs a young woman, a very present fear, often in the back of my mind, is of being abducted, molested or snatched from the safety of what I know and to be raped and murdered in a back alley.  I carry mace in my pocket when I walk down an unfamiliar street at night in New York City, where I live. Brie Larson (Trainwreck), in Room, is that girl our mothers feared we might become.\n\nShe encountered that strange man our fathers warned us about. By the time the film opens, she's been living as a captive in a single room for seven years, and every week she suffers nightly visits from her captor. She is so young, so painfully young. It's heart wrenching to know that her sufferings extend -even beyond rape- to being forced into a mockery of companionship with the man who stole her life.\n\nLarson, Oscar winner for this role, does not play a majestic, longsuffering young mother in Room -- a character type we so often see in literature and film. Emma Donoghue, author of the original novel and the film's screenplay, has not given us a soft-spoken damsel. This woman does not have it all together, pressing on cheerfully despite her circumstances. She has sallow skin, bad teeth, and vitamin deficiency. She screams at the skylight and snaps at her son.\n\nLarson's performance is noteworthy for how normal and unheroic she is. She didn't make me feel like I was watching a legendary role on the silver screen. She made me curl up in my seat, aching for this nameless young woman who is probably not so different from me.\n\nAct One of Room lets that premise really soak in as we learn about \"Ma\" through the eyes of her newly-five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay, The Smurfs 2). This room, with its stove, single bed, and ancient TV, is the only world Jack has ever known. It's not \"a\" room or simply \"this\" room for him -- it is Room. Beyond Room is \"outer space,\" and beyond that, \"heaven\" (where Jack came from, he explains).  \n\nIt was captivating to watch Jack, in the true spirit of childhood, go about his cramped routines in relative contentment. After all, he had no outside world to compare his life to. I wondered, in that situation, what would I have taught my son about the world? Would I have told him -- a child, who only understands by seeing and touching -- anything different?\n\nAs we get to know the routine of this tiny family, it's impossible not to feel gutted at the full life this young mother has somehow created for her son despite their prison. The \"mom\" part of my own brain immediately worried about how this boy could thrive on canned food -- but she makes sure their captor brings him vitamins and fresh fruit. She oversees exercise routines so that Jack's muscles grow strong. They do laundry together in the bathtub. She tucks him to sleep in the wardrobe on nights when \"Old Nick\" comes to stay in Ma's bed.\n\nIn a way, it was delightful and encouraging to see how innovative and committed she has been to raising her son to be strong and joyful. But only delightful like watching a flower bloom from wreckage of a nuclear disaster: so much agony underscores every smile, every sign of life.\n\nThe first half of the film shows Ma continuing in survival mode: concessions, abuse, frustrations, and failed escape attempts. But Jack is five now, Ma explains to him. She has reached her breaking point, and he is finally big enough to help them find their freedom.\n\nAs hard-hitting as Act One is, the film's latter half is a reminder that life can't be compartmentalized. Pain, ache, and regret doesn't just live in one room. So many escape films end with elation -- with that tearful moment of freedom and embrace. Room shows us how hard it is to build life after trauma and abuse. When everything is broken, it can't be fixed overnight.\n\nTremblay as Jack is an absolute light in this film. He's precocious and adorable, but also a raging ball of too many feelings for his tiny body (as all children are, at five years old). At one point, his Ma tries to explain to him the brutal reality of their situation, and the largeness of the world outside that he just can't comprehend. He looks into her face and protests, \"I wanna be four again.\"\n\nOh, my heart. I know, Jack. Me too.\n\nIt feels hard to write the right kind of review for a movie like this. Maybe it's because Donoghue's story and script is not pretty, it's brutal. It's a terrifying glimpse into the rotten core of humanity, of what it looks like when we reach the end of ourselves. I've never reached anything like that kind of breaking point in my own life -- but I've still felt the sharp, needling sting of regret.\n\nRoom isn't all heartbreak and despair. It's also a testament to how we make each other stronger, how we aren't meant to go at it alone.\n\n\"I'm not a good enough Ma,\" she admits to Jack, running over all the could have, should have's in her mind.\n\n\"But you're Ma,\" he responds simply.\n\nThat small moment summed up the whole emotional experience of watching Room, in a way. We all deal with rotten luck and our own failures. There's no escaping either. But through it all, we're in it together. Healing hurts, but hope might be the most resilient player in the human story.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/room, and was written Debbie Holloway.

It's dramatic, emotional, suspenseful and a phenomenal film. The story is intense and heartbreaking (times 4 or 5). The acting performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscar recognition. While I haven't seen all the performances nominated thus far, young Jacob Tremblay is jaw-dropping. I was excited to see Brie Larson, one of my favorites, finally show her stuff, and that she did. I hope she gets the win. However, Jacob blew me away. There were no words to describe how incredible his performance is for someone so young. Better than any adult actor I've seen this year. I'm serious. There is an incredible career in the making there. The screenplay, based on the novel of the same name, is beautiful. Aside from one scene that bugged me a little, the dialogue is so real. The director did a masterful job pulling the screenplay, performances and the perspective of \"Room\" against the much larger world Brie and Jacob are denied for so long.

Hell, I think even Joan Allen should have been considered. Room is about a woman who was abducted and held for seven years, and how she copes on a daily basis while taking care of her 5-year-old son. With this premise I thought the movie would surely be dark and grim, but on the contrary I think *hopeful* is the best way to describe it. There are plenty of instances of levity, especially from Tremblay, and even some parts to smile and cheer at. Make no mistake it does have tension. There is a scene in the back of a truck where I dared not take a breath. Of course a part of the movie focuses on dealing with post-traumatic stress and the effects it has on people around you. Remember, all Jacob's character has ever known in life was \"Room\" and I thought the director and actor both did a marvelous job showcasing what kind of impact that has.",

            "content": "Strengths: This was quite the harrowing film. Seeing how Joy (Brie Larson) lives in a tiny room for years with her son is rough enough, but when we see that Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), their captor, returns almost nightly to continue raping Joy, it hits another level. Add in that Jack (Jake Tremblay) is in the closet when these things happen and it becomes extra rough to sit through. The story and script are both high points, but the real success of the movie comes from the performances of Larson and Tremblay. Tremblay does very well for someone his age. Meanwhile, Larson absolutely deserved that Oscar she won for this. She looked the part of someone who had experienced these things. The buildup to their escape was exceptionally done, as was the escape itself. The cinematography and direction are both tremendous. They give this film a unique feel that perfectly matches the story.\n\nWeaknesses: As much as I enjoyed the back half of the film, it lacks the tense and gripping feel of the first half. You're on the edge of your seat as they try to escape the room and overjoyed when they do. Watching them adapt to the world around them is interesting, but doesn't hold you as well as the first half. The storyline surrounding Joy's father (William H. Macy) had potential, but disappeared. He's happy his daughter returned, but won't even look at Jack, most likely because he was conceived through rape. There was some good tension in the second half with that scene and I'd have loved to see more of Macy and Larson going at it. Instead, once he leaves that scene, he never returns and it feels like a missed opportunity. \n\nOverall: An emotionally gripping story led by phenomenal performances from the leads. The survival aspects of the first half are the best part. A second half with more of a battle between Joy and her father would've been ideal. However, the post-room stuff is still very good, making for a great all around film.",

When we see that we have to be in other places when others come from another place to see us. When being in such places we know it's right and wrong to teach those the wrong things so they can grow. When we try to make those see that such places are alright to make it real and normal as possible when we don't want those to be in our trouble minded places to give them an out of place experience. When we see such places we do go to to learn about what places exist and don't exist when it's tv. When the rest of places we are shut out from in what we don't control. When we see we try to make such places work but see we don't want to see what alternatives others have in mind to take us in other places. When we see that we want others out of those places to live out their life. When we know our place is here when we messed up our life to remain back. When we know being in such places we know where others go in dark places when mad to only make room for 1 place, when others were never intended to be in such a place with us but happened.\n\nWhen such places are too much for those to handle in places we have never been. When some places others have never been we see they know based on surroundings they learned in smaller places. When some places lead us to the places we need to go to free those from places. When we see the only safe place we know are the places we are kept in to prefer those places when outside places are foreign to us. When we see being kept in poor conditioned places we need to go to places to see if we are alright. When such places we see are different when we don't know such places exist when such places have bigger perspectives to see how big other places are then others. When we see we haven't yet left some places when such places we followed a routine to only know such places holds our day to day life and nothing else. When everything in such places are out of place to not know what is the right place to revolve around. When such places takes time getting used to when we are not used to what such places brings when our body, mind and soul needs to get out of such places to know there is much more to life that needs exploring. \n\nWhen only we know what such places are like to see that those who don't know want to know what such places were like. When we see that being in familiar places we feel at home and others not at home when all this is new to them.

When there are many things we used to make place for when we make due with what we had to take such places as knowledge. When we see there is plenty of space on tables others wish not to sit when other's company is a reminder of a place we are trying to put behind us. When what we try to fill such places we see we make a new room in other places with much more stuff to do. When such places we left behind we see we can no longer return to when we are in a new place to see now. When we see going places was our ambition to be stuck in such places with those we are conflicted with. When being in bigger places we know there is much more to do when we are free to go any place. When such places holds us right where we are when we need to take steps into seeing we are alright to fill those places. When others places we see we need to get to when it takes us to other places.

When such places remain when it's how we only seen such places with those we have only learned to live with. When some places we pass on to others when it's the place we left off before our life was taken from us to see it still remains.

            "content": "More Room to Love\n\tRoom is a stunning and heart-wrenching drama about a young mother trying to raise her 5-year-old son in a traumatic situation. Ma (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) endure unimaginable trials together, proving how strong the bond between a mother and her child can be.\n\tMa and Jack's situation is slowly revealed to us in pieces through Jack's perspective. As we gain more information about Room, the tiny space Jack and his Ma are confined to, we discover they are being held captive by a man called \"Old Nick\". He kidnapped Ma long ago, and she has matured into an adult and a mother in Room. Old Nick is a typical abusive kidnapper type, but his violence toward Ma is devastating from Jack's perspective.\nMa does everything in her power to keep Jack safe. When Old Nick moves to touch Jack, Ma fights fiercely to protect Jack, showing how strong her love for him is. She does whatever she can to shield Jack from the realities of their captivity, including telling him stories to explain away their horrible situation. It works to keep Jack safe and satisfied until she realizes their survival depends on their escape. It then proves to be more difficult than she expected to get Jack to give up the cozy stories she told him. When Ma finally convinces him that there is a world outside of Room, the movie reaches a pivotal climax. The fate of Ma and Jack rests on Jack's shoulders, relying on the strength of their bond to save them.\nThe second half of the movie is very different. They escape from Old Nick, but adjusting to freedom proves to be more difficult than attaining it. This is where the strength of their bond is truly tested. Jack has never been exposed to anything in the real world, and Ma desperately wants to go back to the way things were before she was kidnapped. Devastatingly, they begin to drift apart as their individual challenges divide them. It isn't clear if their tight-knit bond will remain outside of Room. Jack sees Ma is struggling and asks Ma's mother, \"Can my strong be her strong too?\" She responds with what I think defines the central theme of the film, saying \"Of course it can. We all help each other be strong.\"\nSome might say that Room's second act is unnecessary. I would argue that Room's second act is the most important, and the film would lose a crucial part of the story without it. Often a kidnap drama is resolved as soon as the protagonist goes free. They rarely go beyond that to tell us what happens next. Room provides a deep and critical exploration of what happens to Ma and Jack in the second act. It suggests that the most important challenge for them to overcome isn't the kidnapping at all; it's figuring out how to be normal again. This leads to meaningful discoveries for both characters, and through their growth, the audience grows too.\nAs heartbreaking as much of the film is, the ending is intensely satisfying. It is more rewarding because of how Ma and Jack are challenged. By exemplifying the strength of love, Room reminds us to be thankful for what we have and love a little more fiercely.",

The second half of the film explores the complex emotions which come from the resolution of such an ordeal. It isn't all ice cream and rainbows.\n\nLarson and Tremblay are remarkable. It's a good thing the producers found Tremblay, because this movie would've fallen flat without a believable child in a difficult-to-portray role. And Larson was just masterful.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of us will never endure what Room's protagonists endured, but I think Room helps us ponder what it means to be human in the face of such depravity and isolation.",

When they finally manage to escape their confinement Jack finally learns about the world outside of his small room. \nThis is a truly fantastic film and a lot of it rests on the 2 main actors performances. Brie Larson is simply amazing as Ma/Joy, who is a captive and mother who manages to protect her son from the horrors of the world around him. Larson's performance has a great deal of intensity, strength and vulnerability and really draws you into the plot and emotion of the film. Jacob Tremblay is also fantastic as Jack, capturing the fantasy of his little world and the fear and intrigue outside it. The two also have excellent chemistry together and form a really strong but somewhat complex Mother Son relationship that is very captivating.\nThis is a film about captivity like no other, rather than exploiting its characters or focussing on the horror aspect of its narrative, the main focus of the film is the bond between Mother and Son and how their realities shift inside and outside of the room. \nThe cinematography in this film is excellent. We, the audience, experience a lot of the narrative through Jack's eyes and the camera work reflects this through its use of tight close ups and steady cam shots and in how it manages to make a tiny shed seem expansive and not at all claustrophobic. The juxtaposition of sound, colour and light between the room and the outside world is also excellent and really highlights Jack's otherworldly experience. The musical score also adds a lot to the film in its more emotional moments.\nThe plot is also well told, initially only showing and not telling and leaving the interpretation to the viewer and later filling in the blanks with some exposition. However there are some scenes where the dialogue is too expository and there is a bit too much of an information dump. \nThis is a very well told, immersive film that focuses on its characters, their emotions and their relationships with one another and is very moving experience overall.",

            "content": "Antes de começar a ler esta crítica - quero que você pare, respire, ponha o dedo aqui e diga: O quê seria de nós sem as nossas mães? Pergunta difícil essa, não é? O Maravilhoso Mundo da Sétima Arte é permeado por representações fidedignas da humanidade, seja da sua forma mais absurda à la Michael Bay ou na sua explosão de arco-íris ala Sessão da Tarde. Com as mães, felizmente não é nada diferente - menos se elas forem negras, lésbicas ou latinas.\n\nLonge dos estereótipos, Hollywood sempre representou as mães no geral de maneira bastante diversificada. Porém, há características que ainda assim habitam no fundo de boa parte delas: o amor e a lealdade pelo filho pródigo. Seja Sarah Connor, mãe do líder da resistência contra a Netfl... Digo, SkyNET, ou Pamela Voorhees, aquela mesmo que uma vez deu uma visitinha em Crystal Lake se vingar pela SACANAGE que fizeram com o pobre Jason, filhinho dela, colocando ele para nadar com os girinos. Procurei pelos mais diversos filmes do gênero (de mãe hehehe) e eis que me dei de cara com uma OBRA PRIMA que há muito ansiava em ver, mas que por motivos nobres - esqueci - ainda não havia visto: O Quarto de? Jack?.\n\nBaseado no livro de Emma Donoghue, minha amiga Donoguinha, o filme foi rapidamente aclamado e festejado pelos engravatados da Academia logo no seu primeiro dia de lançamento, no Festival de Telluride, nos confins do espaço. Seja o forte peso dramático que os personagens recebem durante o clímax, seja pela brilhante fotografia adotada pela equipe de Lenny Abrahamson, diretor do longa, ou seja pela FOFURISSIDADE do simpático Jacob Tremblay, Jacó Trem Bala pros íntimos, uma coisa é certa: o filme lida com uma das piores retratações de um plano de fundo maternal, isto é, é pesado o bagulho.\n\nSituado em uma pequena cidade perto de lugar nenhum (onde fica a casa do Coragem) no meio do nada há um quarto. Um quarto onde Jack (Jacob Trembala) vive com a sua mãe (interpretada pela MARAVILHOSAMENTE LINDA ATÉ CHORANDO Brie Larson) e, todos os dias, segue a sua rotina diária sufocando a própria mãe de perguntas e mais perguntas, algo extremamente saudável e que toda criança faz. Jack é um menino criativo, brincalhão, inteligente e um tanto quanto agitado, e a sua mãe sabe disso. Ele gosta de desenhar, ver desenhos, fazer bagunça e brincar com a sua mãe. Seria apenas mais um caso normal de relacionamento mãe-filho se não fosse por um fato: eles são prisioneiros do pai de Jack (Sean Bridgers), um homem abusivo que a medida que o filme vai se passando se mostra cada vez pior. A mãe de Jack, que mais tarde descobrimos que se chama Joy, é constantemente abusada por Old Nick, \"pai\" de Jack. Durante os abusos, sempre em um horário fixo, Jack se refugia dentro de um armário onde, em tese, ele dorme para não ter que ouvir a coisa acontecendo. Porém, inquieto, tudo muda quando aos 5 anos o menino tenta descobrir mais sobre tudo a sua volta. É a partir daí que, se você não viu o filme, entre no armário, ligue o computador e vá assistir logo pois há um mundo inteirinho esperando por você aqui.\n\nTeimosinho! Se você resolveu continuar, então lá vai: no clímax do filme - que vejam só, acontece ainda no começo dele - descobrimos que aquele quarto na verdade é um galpão onde Old Nick aprisiona Joy e Jack. Em certo momento do filme, ainda bem ao começo, Joy se confessa para Jack dizendo que ainda em sua adolescência, há 7 anos atrás do tempo do filme, ela foi atraída por Old Nick enquanto estava na rua. Achando que era pra ajudar um animalzinho ferido, a inocente Joy acaba sendo sequestrada pelo maníaco e é aprisionada em um galpão nos fundos de sua casa, e desde então tentou e tentou escapar, mas sempre era frustrada pela senha da porta do galpão ou pela força do seu sequestrador. É a partir daí que Joy passa de uma simples mãe frustrada com o rumo da sua vida e se torna uma personagem com mais camadas, explicando o porquê de ela ser tão protetora com o garoto e porque o menino nunca viu o mundo fora do seu quarto, contestando a própria realidade das coisas.\n\nÉ interessante notar como todo o roteiro é bem construído nesse filme. Como todo diálogo, todos os monólogos feitos por Jack e todas as alegorias utilizadas na construção do ambiente central da narrativa é bem construída. Como nunca li o livro, não tenho base para falar sobre ele, mas com certeza muito das entrelinhas foram transpostas pro longa-metragem. Meu objetivo principal nessa crítica não vai ser, de fato, criticar aspecto x e y do filme e sim analisar a construção de sua narrativa no geral, mas especificamente Joy e Jack. Sério cara, até a parada do desenho favorito do maluco ser Dora Aventureira dá pra usar de metáfora, afinal, o sonho dele é explorar os limites do universo e do mundo, não? Seja no cachorro azul de Jack ou seja nos seus desenhos espalhados pela parede, a mensagem do filme é clara: a violência, a solidão e a dissociação da realidade.\n\nEm diversos momentos do filme, têm-se uma tensão particular entre Jack e Joy, os mocinhos da película. Mano, ela passa água fervente no rosto do menino pra dizer que ele tá com febre e depois, como se ele fosse plantas medicinais aprovada pela ANVISA, ela enrola ele em um tapete e pede pro garoto pular do carro do cara que sequestrou ela. São limites do desespero que ela foi disposta a assumir e, sendo essa parte puramente subjetiva, pra mim são absurdos que ficam ainda maiores nas sequências em que ela demonstra que faz tudo aquilo por si própria. Você teria coragem de arriscar?\n\nCom a depressão que acomete-na depois do clímax, Joy perde cada vez mais o seu apreço pela vida e se afunda em seu antigo quarto, o quarto onde foi criada, passando dias dormindo e negligenciando seu filho. Ela não escolheu ser mãe, foi vítima de um estupro e teve que aprender a lidar com tudo sozinha e, quando achou que tudo melhoraria para ela, a vida lhe dá mais uma rasteira ao descobrir que seus pais estão divorciados e, o próprio pai, não consegue olhar para o seu filho - que, vejam só, é horrível sim, mas é também por conta de todo o trauma envolvendo o sequestro da menina. Esta é a situação de muitas garotas que engravidam precocemente e são negligenciadas pelos pais, expulsas de casa e vítimas de abusos constantes. Joy, além de representar mulheres abusadas sexualmente, serve também para representar garotas que são abandonadas por seus pais quando engravidam.\n\nO seu relacionamento com seu filho começa a se agravar à medida que ela não consegue aceitar a dificuldade que seu filho tem para se adaptar a uma vida comum. De crise em crise, Joy aumenta suas doses de comprimidos cedidos após escapar do cativeiro, até certo momento - precedendo a ótima sequência da entrevista - onde ela tem uma overdose, mas é salva (ou não) novamente por Jack. O menino, a partir daí, estaria sem a sua mãe pela primeira vez em todos os seus 5 anos.\n\nSe lembrando da promessa que Joy havia feito a ele, de que se ele guardasse o 'Dente Mau' dela ela estaria protegendo ele, Jack decide enviar algo para sua mãe buscando lhe dar proteção: o seu cabelo (ESSA CENA É MUITO FOFA E EU QUASE CHOREI). Em seguida, temos um dos diálogos mais lindos que eu já vi na minha vida quando Joy pede desculpas para Jack e, este, se mostra grato por tudo o quê ela já fez, mesmo com seus defeitos.\n\nSeja no simples ato de dar bom dia ao seu filho ou na difícil tarefa de visitar o quarto onde esteve aprisionada por 7 anos já que seu filho quis se despedir do antigo \"planeta\" dele, Joy evolui em seu próprio tempo assim como Jack se adaptou ao mundo real. Com o menino, ela aprendeu que nada é mais importante do que manter quem te ama por perto e da pica que é ter que segurar essa responsabilidade, mesmo com toda a tragédia envolvendo a história dos dois. O relacionamento dos dois, assim como o da nossa mãe conosco, não é perfeito e tem seus momentos de \"Mãe/Filha Bobona!\", mas o que restaura tudo ao fim é o amor e a GRATIDÃO que cada um guarda em seu armário do coração.\n\nO Quarto de Jack é sem dúvidas um dos melhores filmes que eu já vi, e é ótimo quando uma película tão pura alcança ao patamar que este filme alcançou. Nada mais do que justo o reconhecimento que o elenco, a escritora e o diretor tiveram, inclusive com Brie Larson ganhando o Oscar de Melhor Atriz pelo seu papel como Joy. São inúmeros os temas que esse filme aborda com maestria e, lembrando, eu escolhi falar apenas sobre a relação maternal de Joy e Jack. Ainda há muito o que ver além da clarabóia.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, do you have room in your schedule?\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) I d like a room with a view. A viewing of our latest movie Room to be precise. Let s recap:\n\nSCOTT: The opening scenes of this movie occur inside a small room where a young mother named Joy (Brie Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) are living. We aren t sure how or why they are living in such an odd small space until it becomes apparent that they are being held captive by a man named Nick (Sean Bridgers), who kidnapped Joy seven years ago and fathered her child (through rape). The  room  is actually a shed in Nick s backyard.\n\nGREG: One day the power goes out and Joy and Jack nearly freeze to death. That s when Joy realizes that she needs a plan to help Jack escape. She begins to teach him of the outside world, a thing he s never seen. Then she coaches him on how to be sick, even how to act dead. Nick falls for the rouse and takes Jack out of the shed to bury him. But Jack escapes. And that is when his real journey begins.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Room is the perfect name for this movie. It refers, of course, to the location of the trapped mother and son, but it also refers to room for growth and the spaces we need to become what we re meant to become as human beings. Joy and Jack turn out to be buddy heroes who need each other to escape their physical prison and then later their psychological prisons. I enjoyed this movie s ability to take us from small scary spaces to large scary places.\n\nGREG: Scott, this is not your usual hero s journey. Often, the hero s ordinary world is exposed to the viewer in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Then, an  inciting incident  happens that takes the hero to an unusual place. Room starts in the unusual place (which is the only place Jack has ever known). We spend half the film there, getting to know what it is like to be trapped for seven years. The inciting incident comes at the halfway mark when Jack escapes into our ordinary world - but his special world of  the outside.  But he is so overwhelmed by the openness and vastness of the world that he is hardly able to talk. Jack befriends a police officer who gently coaxes information from him so that they can rescue his mother.\n\nSCOTT: The film s unusual presentation of the hero s journey is one of many elements that captivated me. For Jack, the room is his ordinary world. For Joy, it is the unfamiliar world. So our two heroes start out in different worlds, yet ironically they re in the same room. The movie must end with them both safely ensconced in the same world. That s a highly unusual journey for two people to travel, and so no wonder it is rife with tension, pain, and suffering for both of them. We often talk about good heroes needing to transform themselves, and there can be no transformation while trapped in the room. So our heroes must escape, and after they accomplish this feat, the doctor who examines Jack makes the point that Jack is  plastic  -- a term pointing toward his malleability being greater than his mom s. Indeed, Jack s ability to cope in his new world is less problematic than Joy s return to her original world. It doesn t help that her original world can be cruel. Joy s father behaves badly and journalists ask her insensitive questions. Perhaps Jack derives his resilience from his long hair, which turns out to hold the hero s secret power, much like the ring s power to aid Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit.\n\nGREG: The supporting characters around Jack are mostly seen through the haze of the young boy s inexperience. Besides his mother, the only person Jack sees in the room is  Old Nick  - the kidnapper/rapist. And then only through the slats of a wardrobe Jack hides in when Nick visits from time to time. Once outside, Jack meets a police officer who acts as his mentor in the new world. Later, he meets doctors and nurses who, I believe, are shot in such a way that we never see their faces. Next Jack meets his grandparents. As Scott mentioned, the grandfather (William H. Macy) can t accept Jack. The grandmother expects her daughter, Joy, to be the same little girl she lost seven years ago. These aren t strong characters - which is fine - as we need to focus on Jack and his struggle to make sense of a world far more immense than anything he ever imagined.\n\nSCOTT: Yes, exactly, Greg. Once again, we encounter supporting characters who are either instrumental in helping our heroes accomplish their goal or who hinder the heroes. You re right that the woman cop helps nurture Jack and guide him to safety. Her mentorship is pivotal, occurring during the crucial initiation of his journey. But Jack s lifelong mentor is his mother Joy, who teaches him about the world of the  room  and then helps him unlearn those lessons in order to adapt to the world beyond the room. Joy therefore plays a dual role in this story; she is both a hero and a mentor figure. A wonderful coda to the story occurs when the heroes return to the room at the films end. In any good hero tale, the hero returns home but sees home in an entirely new way. Joy takes Jack back to the room and he can t believe how much smaller it seems. Isn t that the way all of us see our old homes and neighborhoods? Even Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz realized that home is now much bigger than her original geographic conception of home. Like any good hero, Jack now realizes that home is not what he remembers it to be, that he can never return home, and that he is forever changed by his new experience of home.\n\nGREG: Room is a welcome disruption to the classic hero s journey. While we spend a long time in the Room, it s all put to good use. We learn what it s like to live in a world that is only 100 square feet and the only reality is what you see on TV. I ve seen Brie Larson in other films, but she really commanded the screen in Room. Young Jacob Tremblay also deserves praise for a performance that even seasoned veterans would have found challenging. For two actors to hold us in rapt attention for 60 minutes with nothing but a shed to work in is an achievement. I give Room 5 out of 5 Reels. It s unclear if this is a buddy film or some sort of hybrid. We start out with Joy as the main character taking care of her child. In the initial scenes, she is driving the story. But soon we learn it is a symbiotic relationship where Jack sustains Joy s sanity as much as Joy sustains Jack. So it moves into buddy territory. When Jack and Joy are released into the world, the symbiosis continues. But when Joy has a breakdown, it s Jack who becomes the lead character - sustaining Joy. It s not clean, but nothing about Joy and Jack s life is clean. I give the symbiotic duo 4 out of 5 Heroes. Finally, the supporting characters aren t much in this story. Old Nick, the villain, is barely in it and is dispatched at the halfway mark. Then, the villain becomes Joy and Jack s inner pain and reemergence into reality. Joy s mother doesn t have much to do but bake cookies and her new husband is there only to be a swell guy. As I said before, these secondary characters are downplayed to give Jack and Joy the limelight. I give them only 2 out of 5 Cast points.  Movie: Cast: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Room is one of the year s best movies. Brie Larson turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as a young woman who must overcome horrific circumstances to survive, and if that weren t enough, she must help her young son overcome those same horrific circumstances. I was riveted by their dual journeys and deeply felt their every triumph and every setback. One could argue that the movie represents a wonderful metaphor for how we all must break out of our prisons, help others along the way, and overcome our personal demons. This movie grabbed me in many ways and deserves the full 5 Reels out of 5. As you aptly point out, Greg, this film takes the conventional hero s journey and turns it on its head in a unique and masterful way. Our two heroes start out in different worlds but end up in the same, beautiful world together. They are forever transformed by their journeys and truly needed each other to triumph on their individual missions. This story captures the hero s journey in clever and satisfying ways. I give Joy and Jack a rating of 4 Heroes out of 5. The supporting characters play pivotal roles in assisting or blocking our heroes from their development as characters. The most important secondary characters are the woman cop who intuitively reads Jack s cryptic verbal and nonverbal cues during his escape, and Joy s family members whose dysfunctional qualities make you wonder why Joy didn t run away from home sooner than she did. Joy and Jack are clearly the stars of this movie, relegating the supporting cast to minor status. These team of players gets a respectable 3 cast rating points out of 5. Movie: Cast: Heroes:",

Now live with it.\n\nThere is an old sales axiom; \"Walking past the close.\" If I stare urgently into your eyes and tell you I am leaving the country and \"I have to sell my old red convertible; right now; for £1000; do you want it? I promise it's a bargain; but do you want it?\" Well; there is some chance you might say yes. \n\nBut if I tell you I am leaving the country and I have to sell my old red convertible; right now; for £1000; it's a Triumph Spitfire, with black leather seats and chrome wheels; it's actually the Mark IV, automatic transmission... well by now I have given you four pieces of additional information, any one of which might be the reason for you to say no. You don't like Spitfires. You hate black leather in convertibles; it gets too hot in the summer. The Mark IV? That was the rubbish one they made in the 70s! Automatic? Really? Are you serious? \n\nIf each item in the list had a 50% chance of being a feature you did not want, by the time I have paused for breath I have cut my prospect of a sale down by 94%; whatever chance I had after \"Red convertible;\" I now only have 6% of that.\n\nSo it is with the endless, over sold, coiling excreta that is the modern box set. How many stories really need 10 hours to tell? By the fourth hour the camp fire is dead. By the sixth hour the Ayahuasca has worn off. If you are still working up to your big finale come hour ten you are not a master storyteller, you are a massive bore.\n\nBy contrast, 90 minutes and a one big cinema screen is a perfect medium, delivering both narrative completion and audience immersion. The right seats in the right cinema with the right audio will draw you, through towering human expression, into the lives of rendered characters with unsurpassed power.\n\nLenny Abrahamson's Room is not a film to see on a big screen because it has dazzling special effects or jaw dropping cinematography. It is a film to see on the big screen because such resolution and closeness, when holding on a child's luminous face, will drop you into that child's mind more vividly than a smaller screen in a lighter space with a weaker soundscape. \n\nRoom is a film to see on the big screen because quality always trumps quantity. \n\nFilm is an old, classical art. Movies have been with us for over a century. The craft is narrow and heavily formalised. Yet working inside this apparently limited frame an infinite range is possible. \n\nRoom is not avant garde; it is universally accessible. It is not grotesque or harrowing; I watched it with my 11 year old. It is not saccharine or cynical. It is not trying to extract every drop from every beat.\n\nBut it is emotionally raw, shot with humour and pain. Every image is transfixing. It is unique.\n\nIt is less a drama than a portrait; a single picture of a mother and child, drawn with immense depth and care; spread over time rather as an oil painter slowly layers his composition.\n\nWe are not taken on a classic protagonist's journey; we start with a young child who is brimming with innocence, passion, love, common sense and honesty... and finish with a young child who is brimming with innocence, passion, love, common sense and honesty. But this is not to say the film lacks momentum or suspense. His journey is fractal; one of symmetry at scale.",

Larson plays a woman who has been kidnapped and locked in a small garden shed, kept as a sex slave by an evil Ohio loser for seven years; she's had a son, played by Jacob Tremblay, and he is now 5 years old and has only known the shed (which they call \"Room\") as his entire world; the outer world he knows just through TV and it is not treated as real.  Their life is seriously horrible but as it is all that Jack knows, he accepts it and even cherishes it.  He does not dream of escape as \"Ma\" (Larson) does.  The film makes you wonder how he (or they) would cope if escape really did come true, the effects of this kind of sheltered existence on them, and the severe trauma of it all.

For the first part of the movie, I wondered what in the hell DP was talking about. Later, the boy truly does take over and gives  great performance. \n\nThis is a neat but tragic story. The book is told from the little boy's perspective, and it's hard to imagine living the first five years of your life in a single room the size of a small shed.

Room is about a mother who was kidnapped by a man they call \"old nick\". A couple years later he impregnates her with her son Jack, even though he is the offspring of her captor. she still loves him with all her heart, because Jack has been with her through most of it, and their bond is unbreakable. Old Nick has never met his son Jack because the mom is very protective of him and won't let him touch him or even speak to him. Every night when the captor comes back, he comes into the room, that is when the mom puts Jack into the closet, to hide him from \"old nick\". The mother has been put through horrible mistreatment for seven long years, and is still remaining strong but not for herself, for Jack. \n\n\n    What helps the mom and her son to escape reality, they make up fairy tales, and are very imaginative. The mom has lied to her son all his life, she told him that the room is all that there is in the world, and there is nothing else. This makes the boy become attached to the room, because it is all he has ever known. He wakes up everyday and says things like \"hi\" \"hello\" or \"good morning' to inanimate objects like a lamp or a tv, or even a rug. The mom soon comes clean and tell him the truth one day while they are watching tv. The little boy and the mom talk about dogs on the television. jack thinks since he has never seen a dog that it is not real, and does not exist, he thinks that everything in that room is what exists. The mom tells him yes there is a dog, and it makes him angry, she explains to him how there is a whole universe and earth he has not discovered. Jack now has a hard time telling what is real and what's not, or what exists and what doesn't, leaving him very confused and hateful. \n\n\n   The mom soon decides she has had enough and she has Jack help her devise a plan to escape, but it's going to take Jack's help, jack does not think he can do it, or go through with the plan, but the mom's faith in him pushes him to go through with their plan. Their plan involves Jack pretending to be sick due to lack of nutrients, and sunlight, which has weakened his immune system,  jack and his mom pretend that he has died so she wraps him in a rug, and has old nick go and bury him. Now him and his mom practiced how to escape from the rug, so he can essentially escape and jump out of the back of the truck. Jack is in the truck and successfully escapes the rug, but is mesmerized by the sky seeing it for the very first time, he just stares at it in awe, but then wakes up and remembers the plan, so he jumps out of the truck, but Nick heard him and chases him, but luckily Jack bumps into a police officer, that rescues him and the mom from their captor. \n\n\n     They eventually move into their grandparents house once they are some what ready. Facing the world is going to be a challenge for these two especially Jack who has never faced the world ever, being born into captivity. Jack has a hard time being away from his mom because he is used to being so close to her, but now she is free to do what she wants. Jack's grandfather holds resentment towards jack simply because he is the offspring of the mom's captor. Jack has to adapt to his surroundings, and so does his mom, even though they are out of captivity, the movie still does not get any happier, the mom has severe depression and Jack still has a hard time learning what is reality from fantasy, the mom and jack are still really close. Jack not being old or educated enough to understand what has happened to the mom, he holds resentment towards her as if it is her fault. This triggers the mom's deep state of depression and she tries to end her life, but fails. The mom recovers, and while she was away the grandparent's looked after jack and just told him more lies which did not really help his situation. The mom comes back to her son and they try really hard to mend their bond back to how it used to be, and they do. \n\n\n\n\n    In conclusion, this is an outstanding movie from the perspective of people who are kidnapped, what they go through, how they handle it, although it varies from person to person. This movie is a great example of how love can get you through the worst of situations. The mom and her son showed bravery and courage when it came to facing every day being locked up in the room, but when it came to the outside world they were fearful and scared. Their bond was still there but they were slowly drifting apart. They were a team, and together they could get through anything if they got through that. There is nothing more special than a bond with a mother and her son, and if the mother had not been kidnapped who knows if their bond would have been so strong, who knows if she would have cherished their love so much if they had not been kept in that room. This is one of my favorite movies, and I will always appreciate its rawness, and its truth. This world is full of terrible things, which make you value the greater things way more than you normally would, just how jack appreciated the sky more, not because he has never seen it but because it was something good and beautiful.",

It's dramatic, emotional, suspenseful and a phenomenal film. The story is intense and heartbreaking (times 4 or 5). The acting performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscar recognition. While I haven't seen all the performances nominated thus far, young Jacob Tremblay is jaw-dropping. I was excited to see Brie Larson, one of my favorites, finally show her stuff, and that she did. I hope she gets the win. However, Jacob blew me away. There were no words to describe how incredible his performance is for someone so young. Better than any adult actor I've seen this year. I'm serious. There is an incredible career in the making there. The screenplay, based on the novel of the same name, is beautiful. Aside from one scene that bugged me a little, the dialogue is so real. The director did a masterful job pulling the screenplay, performances and the perspective of \"Room\" against the much larger world Brie and Jacob are denied for so long. I'm so glad at least 3 of the 8 Best Pic nominees are worthy.",

The idea of room is such a brilliant idea and the technique used to achieve it (I won't tell but see if you can spot it) so clever that I feel it's criminally underused. Critics talk about not spending too long getting to the set up but if you're trying to create a universe indulging yourself isn't always a bad move and once you're outside of room the scenes just don't seem to flow as well but the are minor details won't spoil the beauty of this picture. Honest trailor described this film as a \"ducked up boyhood\" but the film-s main character is a boy, you see tragedy through the eyes of innocence and that's it.

Their captor, \"Old Nick\", occasionally comes by to give them food and to rape Joy Newsome (played by Brie Larson). It is only through the quick thinking of Joy and the bravery of her son of captivity, Jack, that they manage to escape. What ensues is a story of struggling to cope with, for Joy, what she has missed, and for Jack, this brand new world. The story follows Jack, at times with voice over telling the audience what he thinks about this great big world. The first half or so of the movie takes place inside of this cramped and worn-down shed where we find Joy (called Ma for most of the movie) and Jack on his fifth birthday, reminding the audience that he has been in this room for all of his five years. Events occur, which are better to see rather than me tell you, that makes Joy say enough. She needs her child to have a life. The escape, done by Jack is thrilling (even though is is slightly obvious that they do get out of the room), in fact, it is breathtaking when we see what Jack sees, the world. Lenny Abrahamson (director) makes us feel as if this world is truly new and Danny Cohen (DP) films this beautifully. The writing is amazing, with very realistic dialogue between Joy and her parents and interesting dialogue between Joy and Jack. The chemistry between Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay is clearly there as it is believable when Joy is frightened for her child and Jack for her. Jacob Tremblay gives a truly stunning performance as Jack. Everything from the cadence at which he speaks, imitating a five year old, and just being a good actor (everything was believable). This movie could have been very different if not for such a great performance by Jacob Tremblay. Also giving an amazing performance, Brie Larson, knocks it out of the park in this one. Her performance as a mother who has to balance the stress of having a five year old child and also being in captivity is great. Another great performance that may not get mentioned enough is the acting by Joan Allen as Joy's mother. While she has a rather small role compared to the previously mentioned actors, she still gives a great performance as a mother coping with her daughter coming back to her after seven years as a changed person. Also, on a less serious note, the writer of this film (and book) definitely has children because the things that Jack say and do are really realistic like talking through his mother to other people or hiding behind her when strangers come (2 things that I used to do at around that age). This film tells the breathtaking story of a mother and son discovering the world and it is a must watch.",

            "content": "I was completely enamored with author Emma Donoghue's 2010 novel Room. It was a wildly original story that managed to thrill while still providing an intimate character study. The film adaptation of that novel, from a screenplay written by Donoghue, has already garnered critical acclaim and even been nominated for Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards. With such high expectations, I knew that I was in for a treat.\n\nFive-year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) has never known of a world beyond the small room he shares with his mother (Brie Larson). The small garden shed that they call home is equipped with the bare necessities: a single bed, toilet, sink, table, wardrobe. A skylight is the family's only view to the outside world. Their only connection to that world is a man they call Old Nick, the man who captured Ma when she was a teenager and fathered Jack.\n\nMa has done her best to shield Jack from the horrors of their life. She plays games with the boy and never lets Old Nick come into contact with him. But Ma knows that she can't shelter her son forever. This life they share is simply not sustainable. Jack is already asking questions about their situation and she cannot keep him in the dark much longer. There is only one thing left for them to do. After seven years of captivity, they must find a way to escape.\n\nRoom is the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore. It is a small, character driven narrative that subtly implants itself into your consciousness. Director Lenny Abrahamson, who directed the under appreciated Frank a couple years ago, deftly gives his actors the space to explore the innermost layers of their characters. Both Larson and the young Tremblay rise to the occasion. Larson in particular gives a nuanced and powerful performance that makes her a safe bet for this years Best Actress Academy Award. This heart-wrenching story about the lengths a parent will go to for the love and safety of their child is a brilliant adaptation of an extraordinary novel and an absolute must see film.",

Set in the confines of a 10x10 shed (known as \"Room\"), a young mother \"Ma\" (portrayed by Brie Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live day in and day out cooped up without interaction with the outside world. The one exception is a man named \"Old Nick,\" who mysteriously visits the two every once in a while, delivering food.\n\nSoon into the film, the audience understands the twisted plot at the center of 'Room.' As things begin to crystalize, we can't help but feel for all of the characters involved. Above all, Jack. The film is told through his eyes - all the pain, excitement, fear and joy. A lot of the themes in 'Room' are heavy, and it's difficult to watch some of the scenes. That said, it is a beautifully shot piece of cinema. The fragility and vulnerability of Ma and Jack make them character who people can actually root for, and the fight they must put up is one that puts them against all odds.\n\nWhile it was not deserving of best picture, nor did it earn the honor, 'Room' is one of the strongest drama efforts in a long while.",

            "content": "There appears to be just three kinds of movies being made in Hollywood these days - remakes or reboots (MAD MAX, CREED), franchises (STAR WARS, the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, BATMAN) and something called \"reality-based\" films (STEVE JOBS, JOY, THE BIG SHORT, SPOTLIGHT, TRUMBO, THE REVENANT, THE DANISH GIRL). The films that fall into this last category are all, more or less, based on real people or real events.\n\nROOM also has its roots in reality. The movie is based on the best-selling novel by the same name written by Emma Donoghue, who came up with the story after hearing about the Fritzl case in Austria. (In that case, Elisabeth Fritzl had been held captive by her father, Josef, for 24 years in a hidden basement in her family's home. During that time, Josef has physically and sexually abused her, and raped her numerous times resulting in the birth of seven children. Four of the kids remained with their mother in captivity (one had died a few days after childbirth), while the other three were raised by Josef and his wife.)\n\nInterestingly, in 2013, Amanda Berry and her six-year-old daughter escaped from Ariel Castro's suburban Cleveland, Ohio, home where they had been imprisoned for 10 years. (Castro had also imprisoned two other women at the same time.) Berry had apparently set up a kindergarten for her daughter while in captivity, acting as her teacher and \"walking\" her to school every morning. While this case was revealed after Donoghue's book after written, it more closely resembles the story. It makes one wonder how many other people are being held in captivity that we don't know about.\n\nIn ROOM, Ma/Joy (newly awarded Oscar winner Brie Larson, DON JON; THE SPECTACULAR NOW; SHORT TERM 12), 24, has been held captive in the soundproofed backyard shed for the past seven years. For the first two years, she cried every day, being repeatedly raped by her captor, \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers) and seeing no hope for the future. Then Jack (Jacob Tremblay) was born and Ma stopped crying. She had something to live for. In their tiny room, which they call \"Room\", Ma has carved out a safe and peaceful life for herself and Jack in between regular visits from Old Nick who drops off food, clothes and supplies for the pair, and continues to rape her.\n\nEverything in Room has a name. There's Lamp, Sink, Rug, Plant and Cupboard. There's also TV - Jack's only window to the outside world, which he has been taught to believe is imaginary. Room is the whole world and everything outside Room is Outer Space. Skylight gives them a view of the sky and the occasional fallen leaf but not much more. As limiting as it sounds, Jack is happy in Room. He and Ma do yoga together, he runs track (Ma, we learn, was a high school track star) and he plays with Egg Snake, his favourite toy. Ma has created a whole world for Jack where he has everything he could possibly need.\n\nWhen Jack turns 5, Ma decides that it's time for the charade to end. She concocts a plan to get Jack out of Room and find someone to help them. For Jack, it's a terrifying prospect. For the first time in his life, he'll be apart from Ma and in a world that he's still not sure even exists. But he and Ma do find freedom and then they have to deal with living in a much larger and more complex Room - the real world.\n\nROOM is a tour de force for both Larson and Tremblay. The two actors developed a strong bond during the production and it's apparent in their performances here. Tremblay, who is acting in only his first film, shows the depth of emotions that we would expect to come from someone who has been in front of the camera for years.\n\nThe film started racking up audience and critics' awards screened since it premiered at Telluride last September. By the time it hit mainstream cinemas two months later, it was being touted as one of the year's best films. Everyone was also predicting that Larson would walk away with a Best Actress Golden Globe (R) and Oscar (R), which she did. (She also won a BAFTA (R) along the way.) Tremblay, too, was also mentioned as being Oscar-worthy but, sadly, he was not nominated. He should have been because we have not seen acting like this from such a young person since Tatum O'Neal won an Oscar for her performance in PAPER MOON. (She still holds the record as the youngest winner in any category.)\n\nThe film was directed by Lenny Abrahamson, who has a brief but impressive resume. In 2014, he directed Domhnall Gleeson (STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS) and Michael Fassbender (STEVE JOBS) in the quirky musical comedy, FRANK. Abrahamson was also nominated for an Oscar (R) for ROOM, but with strong competition coming from Alejandro González Iñárritu (THE REVENANT), Tom McCarthy (SPOTLIGHT) and Adam McKay (THE BIG SHORT), it wasn't going to be his year. It's a safe prediction, though, to say that this will not be his last-ever Oscar (R) nod.\n\nROOM is a must-see film. After you've seen it, then go find Larson's other films and watch those too.",

            "content": "I went to see Room in what has become an increasingly rare situation: I was pretty much going in blind. I'd seen the trailer only once, and wasn't familiar with its adapted novel. All I knew was the very basic elements; that it was a film about a mother (Brie Larson) and her child (Jacob Tremblay) who are victims of kidnap and their struggle to escape. So, when I sat down to watch Room I was expecting something very specific, given what films on this subject tend to feature. I expected desperation, and anguish and the wretchedness of captivity. I predicted I'd feel heavy and slightly depressed by the end. What I actually saw and experience was artistic, heartfelt and ultimately whimsical. It broke my heart, and made me cry, but also left me smiling.\n\nJack (Tremblay) is our 5 year old narrator, and we experience the story through his eyes. His life in Room (the only life he has ever known) is not one of despair or abuse. He is successfully protected by his Ma (Larson), who has spent 7 years as the kidnapped captive of 'Old Nick' (Bridgers). During these 7 years, she is raped and imprisoned by her capture, giving birth to Jack in captivity and raising him with a sense of innocence about where he is and what exists outside. In a context that could have fallen into the risky territory of fetishizing crime, instead we watch the relationship of a mother and her son. Jack must learn that space and time exists beyond their room and TV, and must bravely attempt to escape if he and his mother can ever have a normal life.\n\nIt hits the right notes on all the important levels. Direction, cinematically, performance wise, narrative and in particular the dialogue. I'd go as far to say that Jacob Tremblay gives the best child performance of all time, with maturity far beyond his years. I recently listened to Mayo and Kermode's podcast interview with Lenny Abrahamson, and he talked about his considerations while directing Tremblay. This involved long takes, experimenting with different expressions and emotions while he delivered his dialogue. The youth and naivety of Jack's character feels totally genuine, especially during the narration sequences, and his interactions with Larson as his Ma are perfection.\n\nRoom is most definitely one of the best films at the cinema right now. I have deliberately tried to avoid its primary plot points so you can experience it for yourself. See this movie.",

Director Lenny Abrahamson and Cinematographer Danny Cohen create incredibly natural feeling atmospheres for their characters to live in, and Brie Larson as Joy and Jacob Tremblay as Jack deliver everything you could ask for while portraying a mother and son held captive in a shed for several years. Emma Donoghue adapted the screenplay from her own novel and chose to tell the story in two parts instead of focusing solely on either the imprisonment and subsequent escape or showing what life is like after such an unthinkable event. \n\nWhile there's no denying the incredible tension created in the first half of the film, and the nuanced attempt at showing the messy fallout in the second half, Donoghue misses the mark on too many plot points. Too often the film seemed structured to showcase the acting chops of the two leads (which are substantial) and to set up and knock down emotional pins instead of painting a fuller portrait of the insanity, confusion, and otherworldliness that must surround this kind of unimaginable experience. While it's facile to say the movie fizzles and dies in the second half, the filmmakers' unwillingness to go deep and really explore (not exploit) the the vast complexities of their taboo subject matter, limits the overall impact of Room to technical appreciation and praise for incredible performances. Room was good, it could have been great.",

I know it's based on a book, but I would have liked it a lot more had at least 3/4s of the movie been about them in the Room or trying to escape. Actually, now I remember that I had a hard time believing the escape that took place...like c'mon, you don't think a crazy psycho kidnapper would take an extra 1 minute to examine the kid and make sure he is indeed dead before risking his whole carefully executed kidnapping plan by simply throwing his 'body' in the back of the truck? Rookie, rookie kidnapper mistake lol, that I have a hard time believing would actually happen. Anyway, not a bad film at all, but get ready for a snore fest after they escape. Definitely NOT an Oscar worthy film for best picture so I'm glad it didn't win, and honestly Brie Larsons performance was good for sure, but Oscar worthy? Meh",

            "content": "Earning Brie Larson the Academy Award for Best Actress, Room's guarentee of solid acting sounded like a remarkable experience.\n\nIn comparison to most of the Academy Award-recognized films of 2015, Room's budget is a minuscule $13 million. As a result, it is clearly a film which cannot disguise any shortcomings underneath a spectacle. Instead it relies on writing and performances to carry it, and that is precisely what it gets. \nGiven the recognition Room has earned it is difficult to go into the experience without at least some awareness of the narrative. However, upon careful analysis of the narrative its interesting to note that the storytelling is not explicit. While concepts are hinted at from the beginning of the film, it is difficult to ascertain the context of why Joy \"Ma\" Newson and Jack Newson live in a room and pretend that the world outside doesn't exist. We are given the perspective of Jack in which we see things happen but are given no explicit confirmation of what is occuring. Sensible audiences can probably determine the story context based on their own common sense, but the way in which Emma Donoghue's script cleverly leaves Jack in the dark provides an interesting perspective for the story. Occasionally it may take the focus away from Joy who is arguably the character that audiences have come to see, but even if it detracts from her into some rather slow territory at times there is still a remarkable feeling of childish wonder that comes from this. It doesn't always provide us with a direct perspective on the drama thats occuring, but the way in which viewers are connected to the child protagonist of the story is really an admirable achievement. The cinematography can also be largely credited to this because it often gives viewers a first-person perspective of what Jack is seeing and adds slight shakes to offer a sense of realism to add to the experience. The cinematography is a key factor in supporting the script ambitions in Room, and the technique also manages to consistently provide viewers with an understanding of how confined the characters are regardless of where in the world they physically stand.\nEven though it has such dark themes and harsh context, Room is not a thriller obsessed with condemnation of crime. Instead, it is a gripping yet uplifting story of surviving it and appreciating the virtues of life that exist beyond its harsh reality. The film never loses sight of its drama, but the undeniable human spirit in it gives such a rich heart to Room that succesfully encourages audiences enough to occasionally forget the cold nature of the story's context. Room manages to consistently strike viewers with unpredictable drama and lift their spirits without being emotionally manipulative about it, and its a new standard of filmmaking for director Lenny Abrahamson.\nEven when Room veers into slower territory, the one aspect of the feature that is completely flawless is the strength of the leading actors.\nBrie Larson's leading performance is a truly captivating effirt. Both her performance and appearance echo memories of Summer Glau's role as River Tam on Firefly (2002); both characters carry emotional trauma at authoritarian mistreatment and severe depression yet are supported mainly by the love of one close family member. Obviously the realism of Room is quite a contrast to the space western context of Firefly, but the similarity between the characters made a real connection with me. This is partially because Firefly is my favourite TV show of all time, but also because within their respective contexts there are key similarities between the characters. In the case of Brie Larson, she grasps the emotional complexity of the character with instinctive dramatic talent. The bleak look of emotional withdrawal her face contrasted with the intense chemistry she shares with Jacob Tremblay provides audiences with a clear sign of her headspace. Brie Larson finds the perfect balance between restrained and tenacious intensity in Room, grasping a powerful realism in her performance which is likely to be appreciated most of all by actual mothers. It's impossible not to sympathize with the character, but its audiences who can empathize who should appreciate the mother-son relationship most of all. Brie Larson leads Room with a truly exceptional performance.\nJacob Trembley's performance is the kind which raises the standard of child acting for a new generation. There are so many themes in Room which a child of his age should not be able to comprehend, but given the nature of his performance you would never have guessed it. There are so many times when I can't tell whether Jacob Trembley is executing powerful acting through a tenacious understanding of the narrative universe or if he has been told as much as the character is meant to know and is expressing genuine childish innocence. It is surreal that Jacob Trembley was only 8 at the time of filming Room, but the real skill that he carries as an actor is sure to take him far in his career. Jacob Trembley shares a remarkable chemistry with Brie Larson in which he works with her to battle for audiences attention through a remarkable chemistry that integrates raw intensity and gentle interactions as a means of grasping the full scale of their relationship. It is perhaps the most realistic depiction of a mother-daughter relationship I have ever seen because it encapsulates the close interaction between the two, the somewhat antagonistic reactions on behalf of the child and the mother's fight to manage it all to ensure long-lasting love is maintaed between them. Jacob Trembley and Brie Larson provide audiences with a rich depiction of family which carries too much realism to disregard.\nJoan Allen also supplies an intense supporting performance.\n\nRoom is a powerful depiction of a mother-son relationship and childhood innocence which celebrates life without neglecting powerful emotional drama, and even at its slower moments it is consistently bolstered by performances of pure transcendence on behalf of the amazing Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley.",

Old Nick comes to Joy seemingly for sex, and to give them small amounts of amenities at a time.\n \nJoy reveals to Jack, after his 5th birthday, that she was taken by a man that asked for help with his dog and has been in 'room' for 7 years. \n \nJack has never left 'room' and has no concept of the outside world, though Joy tries her hardest to explain things. Joy tries to escape 'room', including Jack in her plans to trick Old Nick. She succeeds in faking Jack's death so Old Nick can dispose of his body, wrapping him in a rug and telling him to run once he's able to. The plan succeeds and the police eventually find and free Joy.\n \nJoy and Jack, after being released from the hospital, go to live with Joys mother and new step-father (as her parents divorced while she was missing). Joy has trouble re acclimating with the world, going so far as to attempt suicide, while Jack, slow to take to the world at first, begins to thrive in it. Jack's strength ultimately gives Joy strength as they move on with their lives.\n \nThe story is both heartwarming and heart-breaking. Seeing how Joy and Jack had to live, being prisoners for years was awful yet inspiring to watch. Joy's love for Jack is what kept her going all along. Both actors were marvelous in this film and it is one I would recommend checking out.\n \nMy rating: 8 out of 10",

She was abducted by a stranger, Nick, and has been there for seven years.  Jack was born there and the room is his entire world.  Then one day they escape and get to live normal lives.  For Jack, the world he now is confronted by is a very foreign place.\n\nA wonderful movie: highly original and incredibly emotional.  Just the initial plot - a mother and her son imprisoned for several years and how they escape - was original enough but then we have the psychological and emotional implications of returning to society (or, in Jack's case, joining society for the first time), and this takes the plot to another plane.  \n\nJack being confronted by and adapting to his new world is wonderfully and very sensitively told.  His mother having to deal with all her doubts regarding Jack adapting, and any residual guilt she feels from their time in captivity, is a great, and quite natural, story line too.\n\nGreat, emotional ending that perfectly ties up the movie.\n\nBrie Larson got a Best Actress Oscar for her performance and deserved it.  Jacob Tremblay, 8/9 years old at the time, is fantastic as Jack, showing acting skills well beyond his age.  Solid performances from a supporting cast that includes Joan Allen and William H Macy.\n\nMy favourite movie of 2015.",

Muchas cosas quedan en el Aire y nunca se llegan a Explicar o solo llegan a suceder y solo esta ahí sin ninguna Explicación o solo te plantean algo y no volvemos a saber nunca mas de eso y me pareció algo incongruente que El Secuestrador cuando lleva a Jack ''Muerto'' en la Alfombra nunca le dio Curiosidad para saber si en realidad estaba muerto el Niño.\n\nLa Película es buena pero debieron explicar algunas cosas que no cuadran, y yo en lo Personal quería saber que paso con el Viejo Nick, Pero me gusta la forma en la que comienza el Filme que nos plantean como que el Viejo Nick es bueno y le da regalos a su Hijo (Que nunca ha visto) pero luego te lo ponen como el Malo de la Historia y vemos su Lado Oscuro, Aunque no se porque el niño no se Perturbo cuando Violaban a su Madre enfrente de el...\n\nEn fin. Room es una Gran Película que la Disfrutaras si no sabes nada sobre ella, Te Impactara muchos, no te levantaras de tu silla, Te estarás preguntando muchas veces que es lo que esta pasando y vivirás cada momento de Jack y su Madre en este Thriller Claustrofobico de Drama, Es por eso que Recibe mi Clasificación de 4/5",

            "content": "Review:\nI really enjoyed the beginning of this film, when Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay), were living in a small room with no access to the outside world but the second half of the movie took away the originality that was set at the beginning. The acting is superb from Brie and Jacob and you can't help rooting for them, when they were plotting and executing there escape but it was sad to see how the whole ordeal took its toll on Ma. The way that Jack's character was written, was perfect and for such a young boy, he really did bring realism to his character but I would have liked to have seen more scenes of them in the room, which was the most enjoyable part of the movie. It was amazing to see them make the most out of everything in that little space, including the mouse and the little birthday cake, so it wasn't surprising that it took so long for Jack to adapt to normal life. That wasn't the same case for Ma, who was locked up for 7 years and forced to have sex for food but I have to commend her for bringing up Jack under such abnormal and cruel circumstances. When she eventually came to terms with what she had been through, it was good to see her back with her little boy but I'm sure that it's something that will stick with her, for the rest of her life. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad that it got all of the recognition that it deserved. Original & Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nFor such a small movie which is based in a little room around 2 characters, it's good that it made such a profit at the box office, and with Brie Larson winning an Oscar and a Golden Globe award for the Â Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, it certainly went down well with audiences around the world. Personally, I think that Jacob Tremblay, equally put in a brilliant performance and it's a shame that he didn't get any awards for his amazing contribution. It was also up for an Oscar in the best picture of the year category, along with an director award and screenplay award, so it was a smash hit, in terms of the recognition that it received. The movie was directed by Irish born, Lenny Abrahamson, 49, who also brought you Adam & Paul, Garage, What Richard Did and the extremely strange movie, Frank starring Michael Fasbender. He certainly got the most out of the actors, who all put in emotional and believable performances but he did take his foot off of the gas towards the end.\n\nBudget: $13million\nWorldwide Gross: $35.4million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramatic movies starring Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridges, Wendy Crewson, Joan Allen, William H. Macy and Matt Gordon. 7/10",

Some people might not get what's going on at first as it doesn't explain much in the beginning, but I figured it out quickly. What I really liked is how half the film is in the room and the other half deals with recovery. In many ways readjusting is as hard if not harder than being kidnapped at first. Which is why the boy at first longs to go back oddly enough where things r less complicated yet destitute. I liked that it was told from the little boys perspective so it doesnt get quite so bogged down in being depressive. The love btw mother and son is wonderfully shown and great performances abound esp the two main characters. Some parts were a bit exaggerated tho like why the kidnapper didnt take the kid back or why the interviewer was so rude to main character or else id give this movie 5 full stars.",

The \"room\" scenes are very well crafted and brutal (in a good way) to watch. The escape scene is amazing, but rather unbelievable. How did Larson's character know old Nick drove a pickup truck 7-years after she was captured which would've been the ONLY way he could escape?

But we see none of this. The film opens with the two main characters, Jack (the five-year-old boy brilliantly played by Jacob Tremblay) and his mother (played by the talented Brie Larson) going about their everyday life in the room - sleeping, eating, exercising, playing, reading... etc. with occasional visits from the mysterious Old Nick. Upon Jack's fifth birthday, the mother decides that it is about time to get them both out of the room.\n\nI won't go into the details of the extremely bold scheme and the mother-son heart-wrenching argument scenes, but they finally do it and they make it out of their prison - a crucial moment that, you might think, will bring about the two characters' happily ever after. However, Room is not a happily ever after story; it is a story about what happens after the happy ending - a story about transitions. The film is divided exactly into two halves: inside and outside the room, two places that are equally confining for Jack and his mother. In the first part of the film when we are trapped inside with the two, we could feel the sense of confinement in mother's eyes but Jack's giggles and jumping around make us feel that the small room is as big as a playground. When we leave the room - an overwhelming moment for both of them - the room's concrete walls are replaced by psychological confinement materialized through personal disappointments and people's judgments.\n\nThe two main characters are tied by blood but differ drastically in the way they perceive the universe. For the mother, the room is the strange unfamiliar grounds; whereas for Jack, the room is the only universe he has ever known and the outside world is the unfamiliar, intimidating terrain. Despite the change of perspective, the bond mother and Jack share helps them become stronger, reach out to each other and overcome the difficulty of transition. Regardless of the melodramatic undertones, the story shows that it doesn't matter on which side of the wall you're standing because the only walls there are are the ones we build around ourselves and around other people, and that love is the only power that can overcome those walls.\n\nThe natural chemistry between Larson and Tremblay is phenomenal.

Director Lenny Abrahamson has derived from the source material in the best possible way.\n\nThe story is about the five-year old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and his twenty-four-year old Ma (Brie Larson). She was abducted by a man called Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) when she was 17 and since then was locked in a room with a kitchen, toilet, bathtub and a TV. Old Nick abuses Ma on a daily basis and Jack is a result of it. Ma tries to hide the truth from Jack to maintain peace in his life, unless he is 5. Ma explains the truth to Jack and uses his help for a permanent and subtly written escape plan. Jack and Ma successfully manage to escape and now the coin flips it's sides in the movie as Jack adapts an update in his life, living in the outside world for the first time and Ma goes back to her normal life after seven years. They reunite with Ma's parents and she learns that they have been divorced and her mother has a new husband. Her father feels horrible whenever he looks at Jack and thus, decides to leave. Jack finds the outside world difficult at first and misses the room at first but later he manages to make new friends and is able to create a bond with his grandma and her new husband. Ma on the other side struggles with anger issues, is saddened due to her father's behaviour and has worries about Jack not adapting the normal life quickly. After facing a lot of problems at adapting the normal life at start, Jack and Ma finally begin living their normal life in piece and have fun in the outside world, but that does not deprive Jack from missing his early and lonely life with his mother in the Room.\n\nThe height of realism and suspense in Room is at the peak level and couldn't be any better. As suspenseful and dark it's first half is, the second half makes it a brilliant drama with adorable performance of the wonder kid Jacob Tremblay and praise-worthy acting by Brie Larson, who has been nominated for an Oscar for her acting as Jack's Ma. I'd crown Room as my personal favourite movie of this year. Room is a movie about love, life difficulties, darker sides of life and never giving up. Room answers questions that life may raise. It depicts a legit display of what life may become after all our troubles vanish and how to deal with it.",

A good movie should not rely on CGI and action scenes, but on acting, script, dialogue, and direction. ROOM has excellence in all of those areas. Led by excellent, powerful performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, Room will take you on a unforgettable experience. If you are not moved by this movie, you definitely are heartless, or do not know what a true quality film is. Room also shows the powerful bond between a mother and a child. This is a MUST SEE. It is the best film of 2015, and one of the best films out there. I have watched the movie 4 times. That is how excellent of a film it is. Again, it is a must see.",

No sabemos como ni porque, solamente que durante los últimos 5 años han tratado de llevar una vida normal adentro, hasta que deciden escapar.\n\nRoom es una película emocionalmente agotadora. Ver por lo que pasa esta madre e hijo es inimaginable, y lo que lo hace tan especial, es que uno pensaría que luego de escapar todo se soluciona, pero es solo el comienzo. Empezar una nieva vida en el exterior es complejo, ya que la aislamiento deja traumas. Jack, al no conocer otra cosa y ser un niño logra adaptarse rápidamente, por su parte Ma, es consciente de todo lo que perdió y al regresar, se encuentra con una realidad donde todos siguieron sus vidas sin ella, y es difícil de afrontar.\n\nRoom logra ser casi un estudio psicológico de este tipos de casos. Es fascinante ver como se va desenvolviendo la situation, y lo que lo hace tan real son las actuaciones de Brie Larson y de Jacob Tremblay. Hay una conexión especial entre ellos, como si realmente fueran madre e hijo. Lo único que tienen es el uno al otro. Brie Larson finalmente logro el reconocimiento que tanto se merecía, especialmente luego de haber sido criminalmente ignorada por Short Term 12, y Jacob, a pesar de ser tan joven logra dar una actuación compleja y madura que va mas alla de sus años. El hecho de que toda la película es narrada según la vision de Jack, y de la manera como ve el mundo, le da una inocencia a la película que logra que no sea tan melodramática, sino que podamos empatizar especialmente con Jack, de un manera única ya que es un punto de vista que no vemos muy seguido.",

            "content": "Lionsgate's new dramatic thriller Room is one of the most powerful movies of 2015's crop of new releases.  It should be said right off that bat that for those that haven't yet seen this movie it is not an easy movie to watch.  That is because it is that powerful.  That being noted those that can steel themselves ahead of watching this gripping drama will find it to be a completely engaging piece that is both gripping and moving all at the same time.  The main reason for this is the movie's script.  This includes both the movie's central story and its more minute details. The work of the movie's cast is just as important to note especially considering the story and its setting.  That will be discussed later.  Last but not least to note is the bonus material included in the movie's new home release.  Each element is important in its own right to note in the overall presentation of Room.  Collectively they make this presentation one of the biggest surprises of 2015 and just as big of a surprise now that it has been released on Blu-ray and DVD.\n\nRoom proved in its initial theatrical run to be one of 2015's biggest surprises.  That is because it was the polar opposite of all of the prequels, sequels, and remakes churned out by Hollywood 's major studios.  In other words it proved to be an original story even having been adapted from a book published by author Emma Donoghue roughly five years ago.  The story follows mother and son Joy(Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay) as they try to survive and escape their captivity.  All the while their captor \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers) maintains his control over them by providing for them.  It sounds eerily like the case of the Ariel Castro kidnappings.  However, one must keep in mind that said case didn't break until 2013 when Amanda Berry escaped Castro's house and notified authorities of her captivity and that of Michelle Knight and Georgina DeJesus.  Donoghue's book was published two years ahead of the case breaking.  So any connection between the two is purely coincidental.  That maintains the originality of Donoghue's story.  What's more Donoghue largely controlled the adaptation of her story from book to big screen.  This is perhaps why the story was so enthralling in its presentation here.  It's not the first time that an author has had direct say in how his/her work was adapted from book to big screen.  However those scenarios are rarer than people might think.  Considering this Donoghue's direct hand in the movie's translation is important to note in the final product.  It's just one aspect of the writing that makes this movie's script so powerful.  The script's more minute details are just as important to the script as the story.\n\nThe story at the center of Room's script is an undeniably important part of the movie's success.  That is because of the simple fact that while it was a literary adaptation, it wasn't just another prequel, sequel, or remake.  What's more there's no chance of the story producing any of those movies, either.  And considering the fact that a story very similar to that of room proved to be reality two years after it was published proved to be reality, it makes Room's story that much more believable.  It's scary but true.  Even with this in mind the story at the center of the script is just one part of what makes the script so important to the movie's success.  The script's more minute details are just as important to the story as the story itself.  The fact that the story can stand on its own two feet with Joy not even being formally named until more than halfway through the movie is a powerful statement in itself.  More than likely Donaghue did this intentionally as a sort of way to illustrate Joy's lack of identity during her captivity versus her new-found freedom later in the movie.  It shows the importance that something as simple as a name can have in a movie's story.  On another level, the relationship between Jack and his mother is worth noting in regards to Room's script, too.  As difficult as the pair's situation is in their time in the shed, the emotional connection that is exhibited between mother and son is both moving and beautiful even.  It is moving when Joy finally tells Jack about the reality of their situation and he doesn't believe it.  It is sort of that end of innocence situation in a manner of speaking and will really tug at viewers' heartstrings.  The other moments are just as moving in a number of ways.  The happier moments are beautiful while the more difficult moments are moving in a painful way.  It makes seeing their situation in whole all the more painful for viewers to see yet just as gripping.  Believe it or not this is actually a good thing.  It is a good thing because it makes suspension of disbelief all the easier for audiences and in turn makes maintaining engagement in the story just as easy.  It also shows that as with the 1957 classic 12 Angry Men it is still possible to write a good story even with the story's characters confined to a given space for most of the movie.  Staying on that note, Donoghue is to be commended just as much for the manner in which she explained how long Jack and his mother had been there.  At one point Joy tells Jack that she had been kidnapped by \"Old Nick\" seven years prior to being in the shed.  Keeping this in mind and that the story opens with Jack telling Joy that he is now five years old, one is led to believe that \"Old Nick\" got Joy pregnant and she in turn gave birth to Jack.  The fact that \"Old Nick\" bought a toy truck for Jack for his birthday solidifies that even more.  It's a small plot element.  But it is so important.  And the way in which Donoghue executed this element is just as impressive as the script's overall story.  It's just one more way in which the script's smaller elements prove to be just as important to the movie as the story at the heart of the script.  There are plenty of other ways in which the script's smaller elements prove just as important to the movie's overall presentation as the central story.  Audiences will find plenty of those other ways when they watch the movie for themselves.  Moving on, Room's script is just one part of the movie that makes it stand tall amidst all of its prequel, sequel, and reboot counterparts from 2015.  The cast's work in front of the camera is just as important as that of Donoghue and director Lenny Abrahamson.\n\nThe combined efforts of Emma Donoghue and director Lenny Abrahamson to bring Donoghue's book to the big screen is a big part of what makes Room one of 2015's biggest surprise theatrical releases.  It also helps to make the movie just as surprisingly enjoyable for first time audiences now that it is available on DVD and Blu-ray.  The cast's work in front of the camera is just as important to the movie's success as its script.  Brie Larson shows throughout the course of the movie's nearly two-hour run time why she received the Golden Globe (R) and Oscar (R) for her role in the movie.  Viewers' hearts will hurt terribly for Joy as she struggles to raise Jack essentially on her own in the confines of that shed.  And the emotional pain that she exhibits as she comes up with her plans to get Jack out of the shed is just as difficult to take in.  The seriousness with which Larson approached these moments is what makes them so difficult to watch, but not in a bad way.  When she places the hot cloth on Jack's head and face to feign him being sick, it is clear that Joy did not want to take that route especially as Jack expressed the pain at feeling its heat.  When she gagged herself and wiped the result on his hair to make him appear even sicker his momentary disbelief is just as painful to see.  This applies both in the case of Joy and of Jack.  Speaking of Jack, Jacob Tremblay is just as impressive as the five-year old boy.  The innocence and naivety exhibited on the part of the boy, especially when he yells at his mother in disbelief about their situation, is just as spot on.  This is especially important to note considering that Tremblay is, in real life, almost twice the age of his character.  Audiences know that the shed is all that Jack has ever known.  So he doesn't believe that there is anything else in the world, just like any small child.  He doesn't overplay the moment either.  Being that he doesn't he makes viewers' hearts go out just as much to him as to his mother.  Regardless of that moment or any other, both Larson and Tremblay handle their roles perfectly, never once allowing themselves to go over the top.  It makes both mother and so fully believable and sympathetic characters.  They make viewers want the pair to get out and see \"Old Nick\" punished for what he had done to them.  That is a powerful statement about Larson and Tremblay's work.  On the same note, what happens in their attempt to adjust to \"normal\" life after having for both escaped the shed is just as powerful.  It is obvious just how difficult that adjustment was for both Jack and Joy.  Jack doesn't want to play with his new toys or talk to his grandmother's new boyfriend at first.  And Joy sadly attempts suicide at one point.  She does survive the attempt, though not to give away too much.  Yet again neither actor overdoes it at any point.  Rather they make viewers' hearts hurt for Joy and Jack that much more but fill with so much joy in the story's finale. There are so many other moments that could be cited which exemplify the outstanding work of both Larson and Tremblay.  Regardless of which moment(s) viewers find for themselves, viewers will agree that from beginning to end the pair is outstanding together.  The duo proves from beginning to end why their work is just as important to the movie as the movie's story and its associated elements.  Even as important as both elements are to the movie they are not the only important elements to note of the movie's presentation.  Now that it has been released on DVD and Blu-ray the movie's bonus material can be noted, too.\n\nThe writing behind Lionsgate's adaptation of Room and the work of the movie's cast that brought the movie's cast to life are both key elements in the movie's presentation.  As important as both elements are to the movie's presentation they are not the only important elements that should be noted.  The bonus material that has been included with the movie in its small screen release is just as important to note as the movie's script and acting.  The behind-the-scenes featurettes are enjoyable enough.  There is the standard \"Making of\" featurette and a pair of featurettes that examine \"Old Nick's\" shed and the importance of the shed in the story.  As much as they might add to the movie's presentation, the movie's bonus feature-length commentary proves to be the most important of the movie's bonuses.  Audiences get to hear from director Lenny Abrahamson and Emma Donoghue throughout the course of the movie as well as other members of the movie's crew.  And they cover a number of topics throughout.  There are discussions on the movie's shooting angles, the importance of making the shed look dark yet not overly foreboding (this will be discussed shortly), the movie's pacing, and so much more.  The discussion on the setup of the shed is important because as is noted in the discussion, it was meant to look and feel like a place that ironically enough Jack felt safe even despite what it really was.  It really plays into the discussion on Jack's innocence and Tremblay's handling of that innocence and naivety.  The note of the movie's pacing is just as important.  That is because it serves to drive home how easily Donoghue and Abrahamson were able to keep the story moving even as Joy and Jack try to readjust to something similar to normalcy.  Those that are interested in movie production will appreciate the discussions throughout the movie on its various angles and how they are used to evoke certain emotions from both the movie's viewers and its cast.  These are just some of the discussions raised throughout the course of Room's bonus commentary.  There is much more in-depth commentary provided over the course of the movie's nearly two-hour run time that audiences will appreciate.  Collectively it shows clearly why the movie's commentary is such an important bonus addition to the movie in its new home release if not the movie's most important bonus.  Most important or not it can be said that the commentary, along with the movie's bonus featurettes, complete the movie's viewing experience and show once and for all why Room is just as surprisingly powerful now in its home release as it was in its theatrical release last year.\n\nRoom was one of the biggest surprise movies of 2015's new theatrical releases.  That is because the movie, based on Emma Donoghue's book by the same name wasn't just another heartless, soulless prequel, sequel, or remake.  It was a movie that exhibited real heart, depth, and originally.  What's more there's no way that it could lead to a prequel or sequel.  It is a movie that, thanks to its power, absolutely demands viewers steel themselves going into the movie.  It is that deep and powerful; especially for those viewers with children.  The work of lead stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay in bringing Joy and Jack to life adds its own share of heart to the movie.  Their work expertly illustrates the mother and son's close relationship and how it manages to survive amazingly even the most difficult situations.  That clear bond will bring even the strongest viewer to tears at times.  Their relationship is just one of a number of interesting topics discussed in the movie's bonus commentary, the most important of the movie's bonuses in its new home release.  It isn't the movie's only bonus.  But it is the movie's most important bonus.  Together with the extra featurettes included in the movie's home release, the bonus material completes the movie's viewing experience.  After watching all of the movie's bonuses and taking in the movie's story and acting, viewers that can make themselves watch this movie all the way through will agree that they should make *ahem* room for Room on their DVD and Blu-ray racks and in their digital collections.

            "content": "Lenny Abrahamson, the director of this film, is determined to make everyone cry. The viewer will go through a rollercoaster ride of emotions including happiness, eeriness, and sadness. The interaction between \"Ma\" (Brie Larson) and \"Jack\" (Jacob Tremblay) is bittersweet. I couldn't help but feel delighted to see the affectionate love they share and show on screen. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel disturbed by the fact that they were held captive in a shed.\n\nThe room was evidently small, but the way Jack and Ma played around to keep themselves busy made it look like the biggest and happiest playground in the world. The playground would turn into a disturbing hellish nightmare by night. While Jack was trying to sleep, their captor named \"Old Nick\" would rape Ma. The actual horrendous activity was not shown on screen. Instead, we see Jack in a closet trying to sleep while we hear the thumping and thudding.\n\nMa and Jack's time in the room contain most of the film's best moments. After Jack escapes and the police find out where Ma was, the film becomes more intriguing. Jack's interaction with the real world kept my attention. From interacting with other people to playing with a dog for the first time, I couldn't help but smile. Although I realize that the third act was longer than it should be, I was still entertained. The film's most uplifting scenes are to be found when Jack experiences the real world.\n\nThe cinematography was nothing special, but I specifically liked the way they filmed in the room. I felt claustrophobia, which I think was the intent of the cinematographer. Jack's face when he sees the blue open sky for the first time is one of my favorite moments in this movie.\n\nThe chemistry between Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay was very authentic. I felt the love that they shared for each other and the tense arguing against each other. Brie Larson received numerous accolades for her performance, including an Oscar win. Her performance was raw. From shedding tears, screaming at her movie mom, to her subtle moments with Jacob, she couldn't have done any better. Jacob Tremblay's performance was equally great as Brie's. He was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Nevertheless, he still won numerous awards, including the Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, beating the legendary Christopher Plummer. I have never seen a child actor give out such a phenomenal performance ever since Haley Joel Osment in \"The Sixth Sense\". His facial expressions were surreal and authentic. There was never a scene where I felt that he was just \"acting\", his performance felt real. Their on-screen chemistry is arguably the best thing about this film.\n\nThe dialogue between the characters was natural. A very simplistic, but at the same time, powerful screenplay, written by the author of the novel, Emma Donoghue.\n\nI have never felt affected by the soundtrack of a film ever since watching the movie \"Drive\" (2011). The music perfectly portrayed the tone of a scene. From the empowering song, \"The Mighty Rio Grande\", to the even more empowering song \"New End\", the soundtrack played a crucial part in this film.\n\nThis film was a refreshing watch. A true modern cinematic masterpiece. The best movie of 2015.",

The film is actually better, particularly when it comes to Larson's performance. \n\nOne of the dynamics of the book that I found tough to gauge was the sort of shifting and limited perspective that we gain from the first half. The story itself can really be broken in to two parts, and in the first there is the mystery of the room and the questions of why and how and what. Both in the book and in the film the answers kind of float in as we centre in on to the dynamic of this mother and son bond. But there is little room for actual character development, especially given that the film steers away from any interest in a back story or much immediate context. This is where both the film and the book narrow in on the experience itself (of being isolated as a mother and son to a single room where they have built a life for themselves apart from the world), specifically in putting us in to the perspective of the child himself. \n\nThis is where the film has the added benefit of the visual portrayal. Much of the progression that we find in the story is of the boy's transforming experience of reality and the world. The film does a great job of letting us sit in this tension as the boy responds to his reality slowly being shattered a piece at a time. \n\nIt is not until the second half that the story brings in some of the different relationships that surround the mother and the son. Here the plot finds some opportunity for development, and again, the film gains a better handle of fusing this with the first half in a less disjointed fashion. Both the first and second half have some heart breaking moments, but it is in the second half that we are able to give it a bit of context as a dramatic story. As well, in the second half, Larson's character (as the mom) fades a bit out of view as the larger drama takes it's place, but the strength of the film is that Larson's captivating and patient performance in the first half manages to linger and stay in the back of our minds in a much more visual and haunting fashion. \n\nI am not so sure this is a film that I would watch again. It doesn't mean it's not a really good film, but it is the kind of film that is difficult to watch. I know it was up for best picture, with some predictions of taking home the big prize as well. The jury is still out on this one for me. But if you did enjoy the book, this adaptation should service the experience of the novel very well. And if you weren't a big fan, this film should heighten that experience and add to it in a positive way.",

To the mother the room is a living hell which he does her best to cope with each day. To her son, who was born in there, Room is all he knows, it is his entire world, and he has no knowledge of the world outside. \n\nNow it's going to be difficult to review this movie without giving away a few minor spoilers (I say minor as we're not going to give away anything that you wouldn't have seen in the trailers), but here we go. It is very much a movie of two halves, the first half inside room and second half (minor spoiler) outside room. Though both are filled with directly opposed experiences of both mother and son throughout. \n\nSo the first half depicts life inside room. And instead of doing the expected lazy montage which we have become accustomed to in so many films, room takes its time to show you the day to day lives of the two characters, in a slow and subtle way but without ever making you feel bored or that the movie is slow. Each day presents a different challenge for the mother and a new form of entertainment for the son. And each day really does feel different- an amazing accomplishment when you consider the tiny size of room. \n\nThis is then juxtaposed by the second half of the film which takes place outside. Of course not spoilers as to how or why they are out of room. But once out, again the two characters find themselves dealing with very different realities. Brie Larson having to somehow piece her life back together after 7 years, while coping with depression and post-traumatic stress, Jacob Tremblay trying to acknowledge the new world and people that exist within, but ultimately missing his more simple life back in room. \n\nThe acting in this movie is some of the finest you'll see, Brie Larson, deserving of her Oscar nomination and Jacob Tremblay is a revelation, with a long career ahead of him - the finest child actor since DiCaprio in what's eating Gilbert Grape. \n\nThe cinematography is exceptional, and evolves throughout the course of the movie, beginning with close up shots and a high depth of field to show the claustrophobic nature of room, and gradually changing to wider shots to convey the helpless sense of space that Jacob Tremblay feels on the outside.\n\nIn conclusion, I find it difficult to find fault in room. It is without question one of the best films I have seen for years. As you may know I'm a believer that there are very few \"perfect\" films, where everything single frame is conducive to advancing the story, and not a line is wasted. I really looked and thought as I was watching that I would take points off in the second half for a slowed down pace. But the change of pace was for a very powerful reason that I won't spoil now. Get ready coz you are unlikely to see me do this again for a long time, but I refuse to give Room anything less than a 10/10. It is a flawless masterpiece, and a crowning achievement in cinema, the sort of film you feel privileged to have watched. It is that good!",

Room is a rare movie that is almost perfect. It has spectacular acting on all fronts but mostly I have to say that Jacob Tremblay is the best even of the year. He's a 9 year old (8 at the time of filming) that already has the range of Leonardo DiCaprio. He is able to show how confusing it is to be born in captivity and all of a sudden thrown into the world and having to save his mom. The fear and confusion is vividly shown from him and it makes you feel and think about the feeling. Brie Larson also has such strength in showing a mother wanting to protect her child but how hard it is to also comprehend being back in the world and processing everything that happened. \nThe movie is beautifully made and for almost two hours you don't even realize that you're watching a movie. It's finely made with a great cast and a director who knows how to get the camera to do all the right things. The only complaint I would have is the lack of use of William H Macy. He's a fine actor to be in only about five minutes. It's not a deal breaker whatsoever just a little thing that I thought about after. This movie is a roller coaster of emotions so be prepared.",

That's more of what I see in it,\" Brie Larson explains to \"The A.V. Club\" when asked about her reaction to last year's \"Room.\" The crown jewel of 2015's year in movies and the film that won Larson an Oscar for Best Actress after years of great work, \"Room\" is a tour-de-force of the understatement.  It's a drama that works with the constraints of the minimum and ends on an emotional maximum.\n\tYou might have heard what its story entails by now.  It is a tale of survival that depends solely on two characters to tug at our heartstrings.  They are Joy (Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a mother/son duo whose relationship is built on extraordinary circumstances.  Seven years previously, Joy, now twenty-four, was kidnapped on her way home from school, and has since been held hostage in a minuscule wooden shed in the backyard of her captor (Sean Bridges).  Enduring years of sexual abuse and malnourishment, she gave birth to Jack in her second year of captivity - in his life, he has never known anything other than \"room,\" other than \"Ma.\"\n\tBut now at an age where he is able to distinguish that something might be off about his existence, Jack begins the line of questioning Joy has been dreading since the date of his birth.  Fantastical stories have been made to cushion the complexities of the outside world, of other people, of life itself.  But knowing that escape could be imminent now that her son is capable of thinking for himself, it's a necessity that she deconstruct his walls of illusion.\n\tAs expected, the two do eventually escape and do eventually have to adjust to a life of freedom.  But \"Room\" never provides easy answers, stripping away tabloid filler and analyzing the intricacies of Jack and Joy's relationship, and the hardships that befall them once they have to move on from imprisonment and into normality.  The film itself is an adaptation of Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name (unread by me), and a balancing act it is.  Already delicate is the way \"Room\" so grittily portrays a crime story without a hint of melodrama; so it's all the more impressive that it, more or less, is told from Jack's perspective.\n\tIt's a masterpiece in empathy and performance, a visceral exploration as we are so fully placed in the shoes of its characters.  We can feel Joy's excruciating need to put the past behind her, to be the mother she was never prepared to be; we can see the world through Jack's eyes as if we were a child ourselves, as comparatively stubborn to see the world for what it is.  Their relationship is so poignant because it feels so genuine; Larson and Tremblay completely disappear into their roles, and startling is how much we identify with them the more we get to know them.  To shed a tear in response to Joy's brutal adjustment to an unlocked life, to the first time Jack ever tells someone other than his mother that he loves them, is to be anticipated - it's an emotional journey, and \"Room's\" unflinching authenticity makes it worth the trip.\n\tAnd what a collaborative work it is; Lenny Abrahamson's direction, nuanced and sensitive, makes the film the story of overcoming trauma it so desperately needs to be.  Larson and Tremblay, so barefacedly magnificent, are the very forces that make Abrahamson's subtleties come to life in their compassion.  We need more films like \"Room,\" or at least ones that know something by way of commiseration - it's proof that cinema is just as effectual when enamored with people, not mere aesthetic skill.  Here is one of the best films of 2015.",

Unica eccezione un vecchio e malfunzionante televisore. Impossibile per loro, vedere cosa succede al di là della stanza. Ad aumentare l'umiliazione della donna sono le continue violenze che deve subire dal sequestratore. Un'esperienza cinematografica intensa e che ti prende dentro.\n  \nQuello che andrete a vedere non è un semplice racconto di terrore, ispirato ad eventi criminali odierni con contorno di suspense e lotta per la sopravvivenza anche se è questo lo scenario. E' l'esaltazione di un legame tra madre e figlio. Legame fervido, impenetrabile, inespugnabile che impedisce alle condizioni più insopportabili ed estreme di creare rotture irreparabili. Brie Larson \\ Joy \"Ma\" Newsome e Jacob Tremblay \\ Jack Newsome / hanno avuto la capacità  di impadronirsi della sceneggiatura \\ Emma Donoghue /di farla propria in modo incredibile e di creare un clima di forte connessione \"ombelicale\" con il pubblico e quindi tra  azione/ricezione.  \n \nL'obiettivo di 'Ma' è il benessere di Jack e non il proprio, nemmeno quando il decadimento ed il dolore fisico si fa sempre più prorompente. Una mamma d'infinite risorse, trasforma tutte ciò che è possibile trasformare in giocattoli e compagnia bella. Per lei, Jack è la Stella Polare, il suo \"nocchiere\" e la ragione di andare avanti. Come altro avrebbe potuto resistere alle visite regolari del suo sequestratore?  Old Nick \\  Sean Bridgers /. 'Ma' si rende conto che suo figlio, di cinque anni, sta diventando sempre più curioso. Old Nick sta diventando sempre più pericoloso, e la cosa migliore per tutti potrebbe essere un piano di fuga per uscire dalla stanza prima che sia troppo tardi.\n \n\"Essere liberi\" è una cosa e \"sentirsi liberi\" e tutt'altro. 'Ma'  ha problemi di riadattamento; Jack invece si appropria e di corsa di questo nuovo universo in continua espansione.  Cresce e con lui le esperienze. Jack cresce e fioriscesoprattutto in compagnia della nonna \\ Joan Allen / presenza che dà al film un'ulteriore impulso. Lei ha divorziato dopo la scomparsa di sua figlia ed ha un nuovo uomo nella sua vita, l'affabile Leo \\ Tom McCamus / che guida Jack con pazienza, incoraggiandolo sempre. Room è un film che stuzzica, solletica, stimola, risveglia con la sua profonda interiorità anche chi è abituato a pensar meno. Su cosa? Beh, su argomenti che toccano tutta la sfera dell'umano e dell'umanità. Cos'è essere persona? Di cosa abbiamo veramente bisogno per vivere? Perché i bambini rispondono in modo sorprendentemente resiliente quando sono sotto costrizione? Perché quando i problemi scompaiono tuto ti sembra solo un'illusione? I genitori sono sempre in grado di soddisfare le richieste di crescita dei bambini? Ad ogni modo, ognuno ha la propria montagna da scalare. Per il momento mettiamo da parte queste domande e godiamoci lo spettacolo al di là di una porta; una porta aperta su di un futuro appena agli inizi.",

Jacob Tremblay steals every scene that he is in, and in my opinion should have been nominated for an Academy Award for best actor. \n\nBeautiful film...a must see",

The captivity seems less psychologically harsh than I think it should come across, partly because (spoiler alert, to some extent) we don't see up-close the nightly raping of the captive woman--instead, a kind of softened and removed sense of it as her son experiences it when closed in a closet.  I think this is lamentable distancing from the captive's ongoing torture and torment.  I don't know whether this corresponds to the book on which the film is based, but I found it troubling that we're not subjected to more of that routinized horror of the woman's existence. The pace is a bit slow during the scenes in a claustrophobic shed where the mother and son are held, then becomes more intense and jagged after they escape.  The struggle for the mother and son to adjust to freedom is more gripping, and helps establish more of an emotional grounding.  Brie Larson's performance is generally good, but not outstanding as I expected.  Other performances vary from strong to artificial. The film deserves to be seen but is not the powerful tale it could have been.",

This is a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle that will thrill you and leave you fighting back tears. Rarely did I ever feel my heart pounding out of my chest as in Room. Easily one of the most emotional and haunting movies I've seen in a while. Whereas the first half shows us the lead's life in the \"room\", the second half focuses on both mother and child adapting to the \"world\". I was quite surprised how well thought out the whole story was. Just to give a few examples: when both Joy and Jack are in the hospital, the doctor gives them sunglasses because their eyes aren't adapted to the sun, Jack first learning to go up and down the stairs while already being five, Jack wanting to go back to the room etc.. A lot of attention is paid to the details, this making this movie quite excellent and real.\nThe true meaning of drama is depicted beautifully in this movie. An absolute work of art. Room is incredibly powerful all thanks to the masterful work of director Lenny Abrahamson and the acting of Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. They are both stunning and have fantastic chemistry as mother and son. In addition, the writing is fantastic. Touching, moving and strong. All of the dialogue really hits you hard and makes you sit back and think. Room might be quite a \"small\" film but in plays in the bigger league of cinema, standing tall against all the competition.\nRoom also managed to get me choked up quite a few times and by the end it made me realize just how much damage and suffering can be done to a person and last, even when the worst of a situation is over, but at the same time, it also made me realize how strong we can all be deep down in our ability to overcome even the worst as long as we have family or someone there for us. Overall, it's without a doubt one of the hardest movies to watch, but it really deserves your attention all the way! It's a film that truly humbled me and is a shining and welcome reminder that the human spirit and will is indeed alive.",

Luckily Larson was aptly awarded for her work in this indie jewel, based on the Emma Donohue novel of the same name. Mostly set in a single room, the story follows a young mother and her son (who only knows the inside of a room). His mother teaches him about the outside world and the horrifying circumstances that have led to the pair's current fate\n\nRead more at bluefairyblog.com",

            "content": "\"This is not a horrifying film. The story we're telling is about the extraordinary power of parent-child love,\" author Emma Donoghue shared about her 2010 bestselling novel Room, and its adaptation into the gripping drama film (of the same title) which she wrote the screenplay as well. In the novel, the story is told from the point of view of five year-old Jack, who has spent his entire life kidnapped in a 10-by-10-ft garden shed with his mother. We all know about the nightmares when filmmakers attempt to translate celebrated novels onto the big screens, very few had actually succeeded. Donoghue was aware that her novel had become great inspiration to many women, mothers (especially single mothers), female victims, and many of her fans actually wanted more of \"Ma\", even requesting for a prequel or a parallel narrative. So in a way, the 2015 film adaptation to me shifted the anchoring perspective and created the opportunity for \"Ma\" to step forward more. This can be a good or bad thing, as one of the main selling-points of the novel was how readers are deeply moved by experiencing the storyline from the cherubic, fragile and beguiling world of a five year-old. Some may want to hold on to that, which will not be the case in Lenny Abrahamson's film. For me, the adaptation came off accomplished.\nAlthough in a different way, it remains thoroughly absorbing and the performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are equally compelling. Being the slowest reader that I am, there are not many instances where I have the liberty to review a film with the knowledge from having read the novel version prior. Room is one of them, and I'm glad the film did not disappoint.\nRegardless of its success, the film is far from an easy watch. Ma, or her real name Joy, is kept prisoner in the garden shed for seven years, consistently raped by her captor, Old Nick. It's into this oppressive and inadequate world that Jack has been born, as Ma devotes every second of her life in making him happy, creating their very own universe within the confined space, protecting him from the cold, brutal truth. Watching Jack living his entire life in the room with Ma, being the only \"world\" he knows, interacting with the only friends he has, the wardrobe, the lamp, the rug, can be really heartbreaking. Soon the time comes when Ma realises that she can no longer fully safeguard Jack's well-being and his psychological vulnerability is spreading like a ticking time-bomb.\nWorking from a screenplay by Donoghue herself, Abrahamson delivers the story with precision, both visually and psychologically. Donoghue absolutely nailed her adaptation, transforming her poignant tale into a different format, yet sufficiently, if not equally, gripping. There are several differences which did not deter the film from staying true to its source. The narration of Ma and Jack's lives prior the escape is definitely shorter, where the novel spends more time on how Ma constructs Jack's \"world\" in detail. There are lesser characters, giving Grandma and Leo (Step Grandpa) more focus in the film. Ma's rotten tooth kept by Jack as his \"courage\" also receives a different treatment, but I shall not elaborate further (no spoilers, of course). One of the strengths of Room is how it moves from grim to inspiring, the limited space will against all odds translate a powerful, gargantuan message.",

The story follows a mother and son who live in captivity, held in a shed, but after the son's fifth birthday the mother attempts to explain to him that there's a world outside of the shed and that they need to escape.  Brie Larson gives an outstanding performance, and has great chemistry with co-star Jacob Tremblay, who's quite impressive for a child actor; crushing the dialog, delivering it in such an innocent and earnest way as to be quite heartbreaking.  Additionally, the writing is incredibly well-done; especially in how the mother creates a fantasy world for her son.  And, the director does a remarkable job at making the room a world in itself by never showing too much at once and keeping the shots focused on specific objects that define different sections of the shed.  Room can be a hard film to watch due to its disturbing psychological themes, but it also has an inspirational quality in what is overcome and the power of the bond between the mother and son.",

Brie Larson even got her recognition on 21 Jump Street (2010). The poster of the film looked awesome though. It looked promising. And it indeed promising!\n\nRoom concentrated on 2 acts: life in the Room and life out of the Room. This isn't a spoiler because you can see the 2 acts in the trailer. We weren't suppose to concentrate on the whole act, but the filmmakers wants us to concentrate on the people acting inside the movie. It explored deeply on the possibilities of the emotions developed by the story.\n\nBut, don't feel spoiled just after watching the trailer. Because the trailer is just a trailer - not the whole movie. There were a lot of surprises in the whole film.\n\nBrie Larson were amazing in this film. She proved that research and experiment were crusial to build the foundation of GOOD acting. Preparing for the role was pretty hard for Larson; she had to locked herself inside her house without phone or internet; even though she consider herself as introvert, she cried at the very last days her own house.\n\nAnd Jacob. He could be the next star child who we were waiting for all these years. He was amazing! He really knew what he was doing. I'm very excited to see his next movie.\n\nThe cinematography looked hard; tight space is a challege to all of us filmmakers. There can't be so many people inside the set. When they started rolling the camera, I predicted it was only the cinematographer and the director who stayed behind the camera.\n\nThe set had a very great mood-building things. It didn't create that awkward feeling which sitcoms or cheap drama have. I really like the look and the mood, especially in the Room.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nThe movie concentrated primarily on the emotions that the actors produced rather than the whole story, which was the key-selling of this movie.",

There's very little interaction with the outside world.  What exactly is going on here?  When I say you should watch a film cold, this movie is exactly the reason why the saying exists.  Seriously, I think the plot synopsis on IMDb gives away way too much, and a lot of what makes this movie so bonafide fantastic is in the intrigue in the setup.  The way this film presents its story and the manner in which the story unravels is some of the best story-telling of they year, in this writer's humble opinion.  I will, of course, avoid spoilers, but I fully support you halting the reading of this immediately so you can go and take this movie in: it really is that good, and I recommend it to all.  Now Brie Larson has been turning in some quality work for quite some time now.  I have yet to see it, but people rave about Short Term 12, and she's been having commercial success as well, with small roles in Trainwreck and in one of my personal favorites Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.  She is nothing short of breathtaking with the performance she delivers here, but if she didn't have somebody to play off of, her job would have been so much more difficult.  The kid they got for this, Jacob Tremblay, is also equally amazing.  It's so rare to see a child pull off a role this well, and he is right on the same level as Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense in terms of quality.  Room is a movie that is set apart by its script and performances.  There's not a whole lot to work with as far as the set goes, and it is, for all intents and purposes, a bottle movie.  You know there has to be a good reason behind all this, and once it gets there, everything starts to click, and you can't wait to see how it will play out.  The level of drama this reaches is high, and there is fascination behind the psychology of it all; how to explain everything that has transpired to a little kid is not a task anybody would desire, and to watch Brie Larson deliver emotionally charged monologue after emotionally charged monologue is truly a sight to behold.  I'm going to wrap this up so as to avoid spoilers: please go watch this movie.",

It's a film that leaves an impression and shrouds itself with both unspeakable darkness and unforsaken love. The premise, sparsely elaborated on at first, finds a mother and her young child confined to space not even qualified to be called a large room, yet a space that through imagination takes on a profoundly vivid expanse.\n\nRoom is really one of those films that the less you know about it going in the better. For this reason, any review should focus less on the mechanisms of the plot and more on what the film achives. Its achievements are thus many, doing a fantastic job transporting us to a world that we don't understand, and only get glimpses of its true nature. Much of the perspectives, including narration, are done from the point of view of the young boy-Jack. The director Lenny Abrahamson does a phenomenal job of capturing his thoughts, feelings, and worldview-a rather daunting feat for such a young child.\nThis unique perspective is also extremely well balanced by the reality of the situation, resulting in a film that both transports and informs the viewer. It is bolstered by excellent performances all around, especially by the young child actor, Jacob Tremblay, and Brie Larson-a rising start of near limitless potential.\n\nThe writing is intelligent, the themes well handled, and the emotions authentic. \nThe film can be thought of as a bit uneven, in that the first half is so extremely well done, that anything following it is necessarily hard to replicate. Still, it represents one of the finest films of 2015.\n\n4.5/5 Stars",

Tremblay and Larson had a strong chemistry. The supporting actors were able to add depth to the story. So much focus was put on the young boy that when something happened to remind me that Joy had been through her ordeal, it had impact. \n\nThat the last quarter of Room can't quite keep up with the first 3/4 is the only problem. They're able to catch the audience up with everything that happened put until the beginning of Room and move forward with the story at the same time. \n\nMost people I know don't pay the same kind of attention to a movie at home as they do in a theater.

Usually, I want no part of children in leading (or supporting roles), but this was not the case.\n\nThe direction from Lenny Abrahamson is exquisite with views from multiple perspectives.  The music blends really well with all the tense moments, which there are tons of throughout the film.  \n\nWhat I really appreciated though was the connection that builds to the characters.  Nothing feels fake.  Overall, I was really impressed with how most of the film tied together for such a small flick.

De film sterren Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers en William H. Macy. In gevangenschap gehouden gedurende zeven jaar in een afgesloten ruimte, een vrouw (Larson) en haar 5-jarige zoon (Tremblay) vinden eindelijk hun vrijheid terug, waardoor de jongen de buitenwereld voor de eerste keer ervaart.\n\n-Room ging in première op het Telluride Film Festival op 4 september 2015 en hadden een beperkte release in de Verenigde Staten op 16 oktober 2015. Het werd genomineerd voor vier Academy Awards: Beste film, Beste regisseur voor Abrahamson, Beste actrice voor Larson en best bewerkte scenario voor Donoghue. Larson heeft ook meerdere prijzen gewonnen, waaronder de Academy Award, een Bafta-award, Criticus's Choice Award, een Golden Globe Award, Independent Spirit Award en de Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\n--Kritische ontvangst:\n\n-De herziening aggregatie website Rotten Tomatoes geeft de film een score van 94%, gebaseerd op 229 reviews, met een gemiddelde score van 8.5/10 -  De site's kritische consensus luidt, \"geleid door ongelofelijke werk vanuit Brie Larson en Jacob Tremblay, Room zorgt voor een onvergetelijk schrijnend - en ongetwijfeld lonende - ervaring.\" Metacritic geeft de film een gewogen gemiddelde score van 86 uit 100, gebaseerd op beoordelingen van 43 critici, met vermelding \"success\".\n\n-Eric Kohn van Indiewire vermeld, \"Brie Larson en nieuwkomer Jacob Tremblay('s)... getextureerde optredens draait ongehoorde omstandigheden in een spannend en verrassend geloofwaardige overlevings verhaal.\" Richard Roeper van de Chicago Sun-Times noemde de film \"het meest indrukwekkende stukje filmmaken die ik gezien heb in 2015 en één van de beste films van het decennium.\"\n\n-De centrale optredens van Brie Larson en Jacob Tremblay heeft lovende kritieken ontvangen. --Kyle Smith van de New York Post schreef \"het script (...) verlicht niet welke interne schade kan worden aangericht door gevangen te worden gehouden gedurende zeven jaar: Op het scherm ziet het gewoon eruit als Joy is een zaak van de treurige.\"",

            "content": "Based on Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name, Room showcases the intense bond between mother and child, illustrated through an inspiring and hopeful tale of survival and courage.\n\nThe film opens with Jack, played by Jacob Tremblay, celebrating his fifth birthday with mother Joy, played by Brie Larson. We soon discover that their location has been the same since his birth, a 10×10 ft. garden shed with an electronically locked door and a skylight as the only window. Larson's character has been held captive there for the past seven years, after being tricked and abducted by \"Old Nick\" while walking home from school.\n\nTogether, Jack and Joy spend every day creating the best life their situation affords. Jack names and speaks to inanimate objects around the room, as well as the occasional rodent or insect. Although they have a television and limited cable, Jack only understands what the shows depict as being in a separate \"TV world,\" due to having absolutely no contact with anything or anyone outside the shed. To him, \"Room\" is pretty much all that is real.\n\nJoy comes to terms with the fact that she cannot allow her son to continue the life they've endured and hatches a plan to free him by faking his death. As he's being driven to a burial site, Jack escapes Old Nick's truck and, despite the utter shock at seeing the world outside, manages to give the police enough information to find and free his mother.\n\nHaving lost the last seven years of her life, Joy must now begin the struggle of recuperating, while somehow finding a way to help a significantly under-developed son assimilate into the real world.\n\nPart of the film's strength is its ability to indirectly inform the audience as to Jack and Joy's situation. This helps create a dark and perilous atmosphere throughout the first half of the movie without venturing too close to being outright disturbing, which would discourage more faint-hearted viewers. For instance, Jack's father is Old Nick, a result of his nightly visits to rape and abuse his mother. This is found out not through graphic scenes of brutality, but rather is revealed through reasonable deduction. Joy puts Jack to bed in a closed wardrobe shortly before Nick's arrival every night. He is told strictly not to come out until she returns and instead only hears what goes on between them in the other bed.\n\nAt the center of this survival story is hope. This is where Larson earned her Academy Award nomination and win for Best Actress. Despite the peril of her situation and the possibility of never escaping her torture and giving her son the life she desires for him, Joy never gives up. She tries to be kind to her abuser so he will continue bringing food and random gifts for her son. She reads Jack complex novels and explains cartoons like Dora the Explora to help him learn language skills. When Old Nick visits in the night to force himself on her, she doesn't resist so that what Jack does hear, and perhaps see, will not confuse or frighten him. She repeatedly combats emotional fragility with strength and forgiveness for the sake of her son.\n\nLike fellow Best Picture nominees, The Martian and The Revenant, this film highlights the triumph of the human spirit. While Joy doesn't survive a vicious grizzly bear attack or being left to die on Mars, her struggle is just as admirable. The most virtuous and most despicable aspects of humanity each have their turn to shine in this film, but it's the hope that Joy grasps so tightly that ultimately puts her in the position to make a better life for herself and her son.",

This is exactly what the movie portrays! Room was adapted from the book \"Room\" written by Emma Donaghue and it's the story about a young mom (played by Brie Larson) and her son, Jack, (played by Jacob Tremblay) who are captive in this Room. I will not go into detail of how the movie progresses but it's not as depressing as it sounds. The movie ends on a good note. What is so brilliant about the film in terms of the technical aspect is the camera work! The cinematographer, Danny Cohen, shot most of the movie from the perspective of the child and how he perceives the world or what situations are happening around him. You get a look of what it's like to be five again. The time when we were innocent, curious, inquired about everything, and never knew what was actually happening. You start feeling a bit nostalgic back when you were five, when everything around you was magical and optimistic. The acting in this movie was brilliant and Brie Larson's performance for best actress was well rewarded. The complex emotions she had to go through were convincing and well worth the praise. Room is great for a character drama but it does lack replay value as this is a heavy movie to swallow. I wouldn't mind seeing it again with someone who has not seen it. It's one of my favorite drama movies of 2015 and I fully recommend it!",

This movie is so well done and both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are absolutely outstanding.  This movie is an absolute must watch!\n\n- I was skeptical going into this film because I was seeing it so long after its release, and all the accolades and awards it won.  I am happy to report it lived up to the hype.  It's a really well written story, expertly directed, and features fantastic acting from the 2 leads.  Jacob Tremblay is outstanding in it, and Brie Larson deserved the Oscar, though I actually think she was better in a favourite film from a couple years ago, \"Short Term 12\".  I hadn't read the reviews for this and I am glad, as I didn't know much about the story except the basic premise, and it's better that way.  This is a must watch!",

That does not change the fact that her performance was absolutely raw and beautiful.  But Jacob Tremblay as her son absolutely killed me.  THAT KID DESERVED BEST ACTOR.  So far, my favorite of the Oscar movies I've seen.  The others felt topical or timely.  This movie was about the perseverance of the human spirit.  That, with proper execution, is transcendent.

            "content": "Director Lenny Abrahamson's Room plays like a non-science-fiction version of The Matrix. Like the Wachowskis' action landmark, we're introduced to its characters in an \"unreal\" world before they're able to escape and discover (or rediscover) what's real. Obviously, the two films vary in big ways - particularly when it comes to the mechanism that drives this shift from unreal to real - but the idea that reality works better in your head than it does in practice is something that drives both films. It made The Matrix one of the most thought-provoking action films of all time. And it makes Room one of the most emotionally grueling moviegoing experiences of 2015.\n\nIt all works in Room because it's told from the point of view of a five-year-old boy who doesn't know the \"real world\" exists. Neo Jack (Jacob Tremblay) was born in \"Room,\" which is nothing more than a shed converted into very meager living quarters where a man we come to know as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) has kept Joy (Brie Larson) as his sex slave for seven years. (Jack was born after the first two.)\n\nJoy has told Jack stories that Room is the whole world and outside is the planets and heaven, but when a mouse disrupts their daily routine, she realizes she can't keep her growing boy in the dark forever, and why would she want to? It's time to get Jack out - to let him see the sun, breathe fresh air, meet his grandparents (Joan Allen and William H. Macy), and grow up like a normal young boy.\n\nThe film's two halves couldn't be more different. The dividing point is a sequence defined by extraordinary tension - something even readers of Emma Donoghue's novel will experience thanks to Abrahamson's eye-opening directorial skill. Before this sequence, it's a story about an awful reality that our two protagonists have defined in such a way that helps them survive it psychologically. After the sequence, it's more about living in the moment and how hard that can be when their imaginations kept them going for so long.\n\nThe problem with the film - and it's a minor one - is that the story feels extremely self-contained. Room washes over you, and while it involves you emotionally, there's not much after the credits begin to roll. Sure, you'll linger on the clever production design, lovely score, and especially, the magnificent performances from its actors, but those looking for intellectual meat to chew on will leave Room hungry.\n\nLet's talk about those performances, though, because Brie Larson, in case you hadn't noticed from films like 21 Jump Street and Short Term 12, is quite the actress. Room will likely win her an Oscar in a few weeks, and it's a tough acknowledgment to argue with. She runs the emotional gamut, from impossibly resilient to completely withered. She completely puts herself out there without ever dipping into transparent manipulation. It's a thing of beauty.\n\nJacob Tremblay is remarkably her equal throughout, giving one of the finest performances from a child actor or actress in recent memory. Jack is our window into this world even more than Joy is, and so Tremblay's excellence is absolutely vital to the film's success. Joan Allen's lovely work as Joy's mother doesn't make or break the film, but it's wonderful to see her imbue an arguably under-written character with depth and real humanity.\n\nAbrahamson and his crew, I'd argue, make the best version of Room possible. It's a film that wears its heart on its sleeve, and while it will never escape some of the cinematic limitations of its scenario, it also embraces them without pandering or - hey, The Revenant! - devolving into misery for misery's sake.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/room-review/",

            "content": "This is an excellent movie with some pretty damn amazing central performances.  I know Brie Larson won the Oscar for Best Actress, but, I thought, that Jacob Tremblay pretty much stole the show, to me.  And that's not taking absolutely anything away from Brie Larson, who did a fantastic job at balancing the reality, and desperation, of her situation versus her attempts to keep some sort of normalcy for her son, whose entire life has been spent in this shed without any actual interaction in the real world.  Her body language in how she tries to hide her frustration to make it so that everything is fine is excellent and a testament to Brie's dedication to her role.  But, like I said, Jacob pretty much steals the show here.  The film, while featuring some really disturbing elements and a story that's a little too close to reality, also does feature some really beautiful moments.  The relationship between Jack and his Ma, as he always refers to her, is definitely rocky, particularly once they are saved from the shed that's been Ma's \"home' for seven years and Jack's \"home\" for his entire life.  It's interesting to see how, at first, Jack views his shed as anything and everything in his life and how, he feels, that everything that comes from his TV is fictional.  And, obviously, that's his mother's influence on him as that kept his curiosity to explore the outside world at bay.  During certain scenes there's also some narration from Jack into how he sees the world and those are actually really well done, because it does provide some input into how he views the world from when he's inside the shed and, later on, when he's out of it and actually part of the 'real world' as it were.  The 'real world' parts of the film are also really strong and well done.  It's interesting to see how Ma sort adjusts to all of the changes in her life, from her parents divorcing, to her mother remarrying and her father movie away, much more poorly than Jack adjusts to them.  Interesting considering that everything that Jack experiences out of the shed is the first time he's ever seen many of the things he once thought were fictional.  Brie's character mental breakdown is fairly understandable given the circumstances, but she also starts to push those who love her the most away, even her son, who's learning to function without her but also needs and loves her more than anyone.  But, again, the film finds beauty in this story, even if it can get ugly and dark at times.  Before the film ends with Jack and Ma going back to the shed for closure, there's this really sweet and touching montage of Ma and Jack finally getting back on the right path.  It might be seen as corny to some, but I felt it was earned given everything that the characters had been through on their journey.  So, yes, this movie was pretty excellent.  I forgot to mention the writing, but it was pretty fantastic all things considered.  Without that writing, the actors couldn't have shone the way they did.  It really is a rewarding film to watch.  The fantastic acting from both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay is worth the admission alone, but the story will definitely hold your attention.  Highly recommended film right here.",

            "content": "And exceptionally popular being for crimes villains and horror movies young woman kidnapped by a madman and kept in prison in a small, windowless room. Inevitably the dominant thread of the story is to extricate the victim from that room and the complete control of her kidnapper. In almost every instance shortly after freedom is an attained the end credits roll as the dramatic situation has been resolved. Was exceedingly rare story that considers the psychological changes that former victim must face in getting used to a world but haven't seen in years. The latest film one of independent cinemas rising filmmakers, Lenny Abrahamson, addresses that issue spectacular style. This Dublin born director has been making a splash of the festival circuit over a decade now although in that time is only released a handful of movies being far more concerned with exceptional quality rather than quantity. His latest film 'Room', screenplay by Emma Donoghue was based on the novel by the same name. Last night of the 88th annual Academy Awards ceremony the film had been nominated for best picture of the nominations going to Mr. Abrahamson for his direction and Ms. Donoghue best adapted screenplay. The film did receive one major win last night, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, by Brie Larson. There's incredible captivating quality about this film the hold your attention throughout. The film begins, as pointed out, in such a typical fashion the drawer initially lulled into a false sense of familiarity. But even from my point the most crucial theme in the story remains one of the most powerful expressions of love and emotional involvement, the bond between a mother and her son. It takes the foundation of so many horror films the changes the pattern of the tapestry it weaves one of the most endearing and emotionally powerful movies you're likely ever to see.\n\nIt is been many years since Joy (Brie Larson) at even thought of herself by that name. She is now Ma, a captive of a man known only as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). During the long years of captivity joy has been repeatedly raped and abused five years earlier she gave birth to her son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay). The extent of their world is the claustrophobic shed with the only source of light looking down at a bed, toilet old television set. Whenever Old Nick is in the mood he places the boy in a wardrobe, at least bearing the young boy having to watch his mother being sexually abused. Jack has only known the interior of the room, from his perspective is the entire extent of reality. The rest of the world is just the images seen on the television. In some ways this is a macabre interpretation of Plato's cave. In every story there is to be a pivotal moment, a spark that upsets status quote intensifying the dramatic circumstances. This occurs when Old Nick tells Joy that he has lost his job and no longer has the means to supply the provisions. Joy is faced with the very real possibility that Nick will either kill them out right or worse just leave them locked in their to starve to death. She has Jack feign a fever hoping that Old Nick would take Jack to hospital. Instead he said that he would go out for the antibiotics himself. Desperate joy wraps her son in a carpet instructing Jack to play dead. Old Nick falls for the ruse and places the wrapped up boy in his pickup. As they drive through a residential area Jack manages to free himself from the carpet and escape. Get the attention of somebody and soon the police are on the scene.\n\nEmotional impact of this film is reinforced by how freedom affects both mother and child. For joy so many elements of her previous life have been drastically changed. The parents have divorced and her mother, Nancy (Joan Allen) is now living with a man named Leo (Tom McCamus). Her father, Robert (William H. Macy) is on willing to accept Jack, sired as he was by a criminal and leaves rather than have anything to do with the boy. The manner in which the psychological state of the boy is depicted is amazingly textured with nuances carefully infused in most every scene. Jack is considered to be drawn only speaking to his mother. This because for his entire life she was the only one who would engage in any meaningful conversation, the only source of lovingkindness he has ever known. Much of the shock of most, Jack wants to return to Room, although it was a source of pain and hardship is the only place he has ever known.\n\nIn all the stories rare the end comes right after the escape the audience is never permitted to see the difficulty faced by joy as she must re-assimilate the life outside Room. For Jack his entire sense of reality has been pulled out from under him. It is reminiscent of that moment in 'Wizard of Oz' when Dorothy opens the world moves from black-and-white into Technicolor. As well written as the story is what really captures the essence of these changes is the performance by Jacob Tremblay. For one so young and was previous acting experience have been in lighthearted family comedies, considerable, albeit nascent talent is given a solid showcase with an exceptionally demanding role, particularly for one so young. He so embodies the character of Jack that as you watch will become completely enveloped in the performance. For a couple of hours you forget that this is a young actor playing the role of an abused victim and accept them as Jack, a boy was able to rise above his fear and become instrumental in saving both himself and his mother.\n\nMs. Larson has previously appeared in several sitcoms on television and just prior to this film opposite comedienne Amy Schumer in her raunchy romantic comedy, 'Train Wreck'. Once you watch her performance in this movie you will see why she so well-deserved to take home that the statute. This could very easily have been structured more like a Lifetime Movie focusing on Joy's sacrifices for her son. The emotional intensity sustained by this movie stems from of embodiment of a mother's love and the maternal instinct to sacrifice everything just to make sure her son is safe. One of the most forceful emotional scenes that Ms. Larson has his towards the end of the film when she taps into some of the inevitable psychological damage a character as accumulated over the years. It is difficult for her to accept the changes, not only from being outside of Room but in facing the immutable fact that the memories she held onto about her family are gone. Of reality has been rewritten relationship she had held onto for so long has evaporated. The brilliance of all involved in this film has taken a hack the premise from horror and turned it into one of the most remarkable examinations of human spirit and the strength that love brings people. This is a film you will want repeatedly just to appreciate the sheer artistry it manifests.",

            "content": "Lenny Abrahamson's Room is poignant. Room is evocative. Room is devastatingly beautiful. There is a magic in creating a world in a child's perspective. To capture and display the innocence, the purity, the sheer amount of confusing vastness of the world is no mean feat. Writer Emma Donoghue, who is also the writer of the book that the film is based upon, and director Lenny Abrahamson manage to do just that.\n\nThe film starts with the pair of mother and son, Joy and Jack, played by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay living their lives while scrapping for resources yet finding solace in each other's company, in a room. That is right. In a single room (which later revealed to be a garden shed with a skylight as the only source of sun). The reason behind this ordeal revealed to be that Joy had been abducted by person referred only as 'Old Nick'. Old Nick kept Joy and Jack, who is his biological son, sans any means of communication with the outside world and had them live a life devoid of any hope to go back to the world. \n\nWithout revealing much about what happens next in the film, it can be said that what follows is one of the heart-wrenching and heart-warming story about love, innocence and those little joys of the world that we often overlook. There is a slight tonal shift in the second half as the tension of escape and sweetness of the love between mother and son gets replaced with Joy facing the reality of the world. But the change is in coherence with the story and that helped in underlining the difficulty both protagonists, especially Joy, is facing in their new world. Even without reading the book, I must say that the screenplay immensely helped in establishing the dichotomy of the emotions that the protagonists went through. Lenny Abrahamson's direction complemented that aforementioned dichotomy. The first act was shot quite meticulously in the closed room, thus providing a sense of foreboding and an urge for escape. \n\nAlthough bolstered by a good support cast the film largely centers around the mother, played by Brie Larson and the son, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson, whose hitherto best performance perhaps had been in the largely underrated 2013 film Short Term 12, churned out a superlative and breathtaking performance as the mother. The role was a delight for an actor of her capability and she made the character her own. Restrained and gritty while being captive in the room and yet lovingly playing with her son; Vulnerable and fragile, being captive of her own thoughts and insecurities, while trying to get her son attuned to the big world; Brie Larson shines throughout her role. \n\nBut, the film would not have been so pure, so emotional, so magical without the brilliant performance of Jacob Tremblay, as the 5 year old. It is one of the finest performances from a child I have ever seen. The fear of the task her mother asked, then the taste of freedom, then again the intimidation of the vast world that had hitherto been unknown to him. We feel everything through the wondrous performance of Jacob Tremblay and he genuinely smiled in the film when seeing a 'real' dog for the first time, it becomes difficult to hold tears back. \n\nAt this point, it would not be fair if Stephen Rennick's score is not mentioned. The music, with the appropriate usage, bolstered the scenes and helped the film in taking the audience for the ride. \n\nRoom is a film that would provide its audiences a perspective that we often ignore; and for this very reason it is a film that should not be missed.",

Sie überlegt, wie sie vor dem Monster fliehen soll,d er sie gefangen hält - Das ist nur ein einfacher Entwurf aus dem, was sich in Room vor uns entfaltet als intensiv spürbares filmisches Experiment: Die 24jährige Joy (Brie Larson) und ihr kleiner Sohn Jack leben in einem schäbigen Raum mit Kochecke, Bett, Tisch und Toilette. Alles wirkt ramponiert und schmutzig. Irgendwann merken wir, dass die beiden Insassen eines Gefängnisses sind und den Raum niemals verlassen. Joy seit ihrer Entführung vor sieben Jahren, der Junge seit seiner Geburt. Er ist der Sohn des Entführers, das Ergebnis einer von zahlreichen Vergewaltigungen. Trotzdem liebt Joy ihr Kind über alles. Sie lässt es in dem Glauben aufwachsen, der Raum sei die ganze Welt. Und die Fernsehbilder? Nur ein Spiel. Wir bleiben mit Joy und Jack in dem Verliess. Wir sind gezwungen, uns auf ihr klaustrophobisches Leben einzulassen. Joy schwankt zwischen leiser Hoffnung, Panik und Depressionen. Das Geschehen wird aber vor allem durch die Perspektive von Jack erzählt. Dem Film gelingt das Kunststück, die unschuldige Sicht dieses Kindes nachzuempfinden. Im Gegensatz zu Jack wissen wir aber, dass der regelmässig auftauchende \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridges) kein böser Zauberer ist. Schliesslich erträgt Joy die Lügen nicht mehr und erzählt ihrem Sohn die Wahrheit. Jack erlebt panisch wie sein Weltbild erschüttert wird. Für den Täter interessiert sich der Film dagegen nicht. Was mir an Room mit am besten gefiel, ist die Tatsache, wie es ein solch intimer Film leistet, die grossen Fragen zu stellen. Was brauchen wir wirklich zum Leben? Weshalb sind Kinder so erstaunlich belastbar unter Zwang? Was geschieht, wenn alle Qualen schliesslich verschwinden und sich Zufriedenheit dennoch bloss als Illusion erweist? Und was machen Eltern, wenn die Kinder herauswachsen aus ihrer Fürsorge? Am Ende werden wir wieder allein sein mit Mutter und Sohn - aber diesmal vor einer dämmernden Zukunft... mehr auf cinegeek.de",

So I think this film was great, you should see it, don't read ahead if you want to go in with little info as I did, I think it helped the experience. Spoilers then, it is a film about a woman who is being held captive by a man, and her son who is the product of the rape this man routinely performs on her.  The kid turns five, and she finally begins to tell him that there is an outside world beyond the shed they are in, and not long after they are able to escape...and the next half of the movie is essentially the aftermath. The kid goes from believing the entire world is a small shed, to having his entire perception changed and challenged...while the mother is forced to deal with the reality of what happened to her, and how she can deal with her parents. The film is almost entirely from the kid's perspective.  The way he sees things. It is a great character drama, told really well...and it just hooked me in. The escape sequence had me at the edge of my seat and I was almost trembling because of it. Rare for me to get this emotionally invested in a film these days. high quality filmmaking!",

Cada escena de Room es delicadamente visceral, cada línea y cada cuadro. Sostener la primera parte con dos personajes es un gran reto, de hecho yo tenía bajas expectativas de ello, pero Jackob Tremblay y Brie Larson tienen una química espectacular y logran mantener al espectador esperando por el final. Parecería que la segunda parte puede ser más sencilla (quienes vieron el tráiler sabrán a lo que me refiero, nos la espoliearon, aparentemente); pero no: se vuelve muy muy compleja, los personajes empiezan a descubrir sus matices que nos llevan viviros. Es imposible no sentir cada emoción proyectada por las protagonistas. Por primera vez estoy muy feliz de no haber leído el libro antes de ver la película.

But in 2015, director Lenny Abrahamson gave audiences a drama that modernizes Plato´s Allegory, and it became one of the most critically acclaimed films of its year. Does it deserves the acclaim it got?\nJoy Newsome is a young woman who is trapped inside a small soundproof room. Inside this room she gives birth a boy who she names Jack. Being born inside this room, Jack is unaware of the world, he believes that the room is the whole world, but Joy know that's not healthy and tries to correct the situation. \nThe idea of making a modern drama inspired by Plato´s work is inspiring and daring, so I was more than curious to see what the finished result of this experiment was and I will admit that I hadn't been so surprised by a film in a long time. \"Room\" counts with an impressive performance by Brie Larson that undeniably deserves an Academy Award, Abrahamson´s directing is so subtle and minimalist that you almost let go the brilliance of his use of perspective, the overall idea of having the child be our point of view is daring, beautiful and intriguing; the screenplay is extremely well written and wisely knows where to focus on, the score is minimalistic but it is used appropriately and it manages to add felling to the scenes it's in, the storytelling relies completely into the visuals, despite the use of numerous voiceovers; the themes are heartbreaking and inspiring, the balance of tone is perfect as it can go from cute and inspiring to harsh and dark, and it has one of the most impressive child actors I have ever seen. \n\"Room\" is one of the most intriguing, inspiring and creative indie films I have seen in a long time. It truly shows the magic of simplicity and how magical a story can be. Compared to all the films I have seen from the solid/impressive year that 2015 was, I dare say that \"Room\" is my favorite (followed by \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", \"Inside Out\", and \"The Force Awakens\").",

            "content": "Giving meaning to tragedy and trauma is dangerous ground. Whether you're a preacher, a writer, a journalist, a film-maker or just somebody trying to walk alongside someone experiencing trauma, the traps are the same. Say too much and you risk the trite, the trivial, the weightless; say too little and you risk a silence which is filled by worst imaginings. Try to find meaning and you flirt with missing the point, not doing justice to the pain; try to let events speak for themselves and you come close to nihilism. There's so much that can go wrong it's best to do nothing if you don't have to, if events don't force themselves on you. Trauma is distant to most of us But as I found out when my when friend was murdered by terrorists, that approach is ultimately of no use; sometimes the worst case happens, the unthinkable becomes your daily concern, the unimaginable your lived experience. \n\nThis is the territory we are in with Room, the film adaptation of Emma Donoghue's  massively successful novel (an adaption written by the novelist). I had little knowledge of the book personally, but the film-makers want us to be in no doubt as to where this film goes - the bare facts make this a hard sell. It's the story of a young woman (faultlessly played by Brie Larson) confined in one room for seven years where she's repeatedly raped by her captor; she inhabits the room with her five-year old son to whom she gave birth in the room as a result of the rapes. Jack's world is the world in four walls; it's all he's ever known, all he's ever seen save for what he sees through the single window in the form of a skylight and the television. This is a child's eye view film; it is through him we perceive the abuse which we never see; it's through him we learn of his mother past life on the outside; it's with him that we eventually journey to the outside world in the film's final third. \n\nJack's mum has helped him create a fantastical world within the four walls of his existence; around his fifth birthday she tries to explain the outside world to him. He's disbelieving, but gradually grasps towards something resembling truth. When he attempts to affect their escape he's just about aware enough to cope with the revelation that there are other people and animals and places. \n\nWe know there are real-world equivalents to this fictional story, but still this film is trying to imagine the unimaginable. By all rights it should be inadequate or trite or tasteless or just plain unbelievable. In trying to make a film that isn't a thriller or a drama or comedy but instead a hymn to love and relationships, the film-makers should be falling flat on their faces. Instead they've given us a genuinely unforgettable, overwhelming and transcendent film that helps us rediscover ourselves, our loved ones and the world around us. It finds beauty in the desperately ordinary thanks to some remarkable cinematography that makes the small room both a place of captivity and a universe to discover; the relationships are perfectly drawn and life-affirming thanks to Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's (the son, Jack) achingly beautiful performances. The depths of their relationship are unfathomable yet also utterly recognisable to anyone who has ever loved. The startlingly brilliant music haunts, prods, pushes and finally engulfs. We never see the rape or abuse take place, but we're left in no doubt as to its reality, its inescapability. Yet we're never without hope or beauty, and ultimately the film lets us and the characters find life in new, beautiful and subtle ways. \n\nThere's much to say about Room, but at the end of the day there's little I can properly articulate. I can think of maybe one other film (Pan's Labyrinth  - in many ways very different, in others very similar) that has come close to making me feel as moved, alive, tearful and full of wonder as this one. It's a rare work of art that leaves you speechless yet desperate to talk, but Room is one of them.",

None of which should imply that the main entree here is not the brilliantly intertwined performances of Ms. Larson and Jacob Tremblay. None of this would have held together if not for the incredible intimacy they achieve as a mother and son bonded by extraordinarily demanding circumstance.  Indeed, the only interruption of my complete absorption was from occasionally remembering the gobsmacking inexplicability of this exciting new artist's snubbing by the Academy.

I became irritated by the premise that the mother so isolated the boy from the world, and that she could not wipe out the monster doing this to them in the seven years preceding the opening of the film.  I tend to be a bit claustrophobic, and that may well have affected my enjoyment of the film.  It was effective in triggering feelings of claustrophobia, although inducing that particular feeling isn't terribly difficult.  The film would have been far more effective if the reveal had been cleverly hidden long enough to make a horrible, heart-wrenching twist near the end.  \n*\nPLOT HOLES -- SPOILERS AHEAD:  \nLots of problems.  No one noticed this guy in the neighborhood going out to an AIR CONDITIONED SHED all the time?  For seven years?  Really?  I find it hard to believe that no one noticed the major plot hole that the hinges of the door were on the inside, and the door could simply have been removed by removing the pins from the hinges.  The rug plan was just silly.  Why not simply throw a pot of boiling water on the douche when he comes in?   What's he going to do, block it?  Then beat him to death with the pot.  Also, why didn't she make a break for it when the guy was carrying out the rug?  I don't buy the cop putting the location together so quickly on what she had.  The mom adjusted too quickly to bring free.  She would have been a basket case.  How about a female doctor, or at least not a male psychiatrist with a beard?  None of this was considered.  Additionally, there would be enormous assistance/intrusion from state services to make sure the mother was capable of taking care of the child and was psychologically competent.  They would never let the boy stay with Leo, not a relative, and living  unmarried with the grandmother.  Leaving him alone with him that quickly would never be allowed.  A little research would have revealed all of this.  Finally,  the filmmaker is an asshole for putting a veteran plate on the monster's car.",

The last half of the film explores the question of what is a good parent in very incisive ways, asking the nuture/nature question out loud and with a vengeance. I was deeply moved by the story and thought about it often the next day. It's a film that, in other hands, would have become a thriller. But in Abrahamson's capable hands (and with incredible performances), it stays on task and is even sweet at times. Wonderful little touches. The theme of the film has to do with what we take for granted -- how much of interest and value exist in a single microsphere. The film also, I think, probes the depth of parental love, and even how our culture can be at odds with such love. The film is alive -- it breathes. The child actor (Jason Tremblay) is incredible to watch and so absolutely in character --- he's a genius.",

I don't think I am letting any cats out of the bag by saying they escape imprisonment, so the film is as much about coping afterward. Larson is good, playing resilience and getting a touch of the blues, but Jacob Tremblay as, the child born in captivity; Jack, was even better. As his hair is so long, the old couple next to me were convinced he was a girl. Jack's wonderment at the new universe that unfolds outside his old home \"Room\" is the best thing about the film - although I wasn't as moved as I felt I ought to be, it was still worth the go see.",

Owing much to the infamous Joseph Fritzl case, the story opens in the eponymous location, and immediately introduces us to the characters we will see grow and evolve, not just out of their secluded prison, but into their new lives. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are perfectly cast, inhabiting their respective roles with complete dedication and believability. They react to each other very realistically, and the films highlights are when the mother tries to explain to her son the concept of the real world he has never had the chance to see. We stay in Room for close to 50 minutes. A wise decision, since it gives us a glimpse of what it must be like to live a life of intense, grindingly monotonous claustrophobia. An especially beautiful scene is when the boy looks up at the naked sky for the first ever time, and is frozen in wonderment. The main issues with the movie occur, ironically, once they've escaped Room. From there we are forced to go through the classic PTSD rigmarole which, while sensitively done, seems somewhat sanitised, with both characters adapting to the outside world surprisingly fast, considering how long they were locked up. Larson deserves acclaim for her performance, but I can't shake the feeling that she received so many accolades because of the character she plays, not how she played it. On screen portrayals of trauma, if done well, are always popular when awards season rolls round. With that said, I would still strongly recommend this film. It's uplifting when it needs to be and deeply emotional when it has to be, but never makes the mistake of descending into melodrama. See it for the performances, the drama and it's take on the outside world, as seen through the bright eyes of a naïve but incredibly brave child.",

To the mother the room is a living hell which he does her best to cope with each day. To her son, who was born in there, Room is all he knows, it is his entire world, and he has no knowledge of the world outside. \n\nNow it's going to be difficult to review this movie without giving away a few minor spoilers (I say minor as we're not going to give away anything that you wouldn't have seen in the trailers), but here we go. It is very much a movie of two halves, the first half inside room and second half (minor spoiler) outside room. Though both are filled with directly opposed experiences of both mother and son throughout. \n\nSo the first half depicts life inside room. And instead of doing the expected lazy montage which we have become accustomed to in so many films, room takes its time to show you the day to day lives of the two characters, in a slow and subtle way but without ever making you feel bored or that the movie is slow. Each day presents a different challenge for the mother and a new form of entertainment for the son. And each day really does feel different- an amazing accomplishment when you consider the tiny size of room. \n\nThis is then juxtaposed by the second half of the film which takes place outside. Of course not spoilers as to how or why they are out of room. But once out, again the two characters find themselves dealing with very different realities. Brie Larson having to somehow piece her life back together after 7 years, while coping with depression and post-traumatic stress, Jacob Tremblay trying to acknowledge the new world and people that exist within, but ultimately missing his more simple life back in room. \n\nThe acting in this movie is some of the finest you'll see, Brie Larson, deserving of her Oscar nomination and Jacob Tremblay is a revelation, with a long career ahead of him - the finest child actor since DiCaprio in what's eating Gilbert Grape. \n\nThe cinematography is exceptional, and evolves throughout the course of the movie, beginning with close up shots and a high depth of field to show the claustrophobic nature of room, and gradually changing to wider shots to convey the helpless sense of space that Jacob Tremblay feels on the outside.\n\nIn conclusion, I find it difficult to find fault in room. It is without question one of the best films I have seen for years. As you may know I'm a believer that there are very few \"perfect\" films, where everything single frame is conducive to advancing the story, and not a line is wasted. I really looked and thought as I was watching that I would take points off in the second half for a slowed down pace. But the change of pace was for a very powerful reason that I won't spoil now. Get ready coz you are unlikely to see me do this again for a long time, but I refuse to give Room anything less than a 10/10. It is a flawless masterpiece, and a crowning achievement in cinema, the sort of film you feel privileged to have watched. It is that good!",

            "content": "Discovering a whole new world beyond the 4 walls.\n\nWe all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.\n\nThe both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.\n\n\"If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.\"\n\nThe movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.\n\nIt was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.\n\n\"When I was small, I only knew small things.\nBut now I'm five, I know everything.\"\n\nIt was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.\n\nWhen a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half.  Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.\n\nThere were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.\n\n9/10",

Probably the most convincing acting I've seen from an 8 year-old. The rest of the cast are successful too, with Brie Larson (Jack's mother) and Joan Allen's (Jack's grandmother) searing performances being standouts.\n\nThe first half of the film is seriously intense. There is an inherent tension, sizzling between the innocently direct dialogue, that will have viewers emotionally invested in both the characters and the story. Room remains unapologetically suspenseful throughout, combining with its delve stating revelations to create a scathingly unsettling atmosphere. Everything is on the table during Jack and Ma's desperate attempt at survival. The same can be said for the second half of the film. When emotions are meant to heighten, the film stumbles and becomes emotionally stilted. Maybe its pale delivery was an attempt to make it more acceptably cinematic, more comfortable. I don't really know. What I do know is that the script holds back what it should have  propelled forward. There's sure to be more of an explosion of emotion from the audience, than the characters themselves.\n\nDespite the script's flaws, Lenny Abrahamson manages to portray these characters with sincerity, illuminating the toughest moments of this harrowing story. His efforts are reflected wholeheartedly in the ending scene, when Room is finally seen for what it truly is: not an endless world as previously portrayed, not the home Jack knew from the day he was born, but simply a sickeningly enclosed prison. This revelation, to Jack, and even his Ma, is enough of an achievement in itself to make it one of the worthiest films of recent.\n\nMore reviews at Deliberate (thisisdeliberate.com).",

Jacob Tremblay's performance as the little boy Jake is truly moving and Brie Larson playing his mother makes these two actors quite the mother-son team. They carry the film all the way through. The first hour of the film they're trapped in a shed trying to find a way to escape. In the second hour of the film they're out in the real world trying to adjust which turns out to be quite the challenge. Brie Larson is well deserving to win this year's Oscar for best actress. Joan Allen's performance as Jack's grandma and Joy's(Brie Larson's) mother is also quite loving. This is not a film for everyone especially if you're a parent with a really young child. The writing is outstanding and the story is truly touching. It might even make you cry a little, but the film ends happily. My grade=95%(A).",

            "content": "In some respects, ROOM is an incredibly impressive film, one that contains a pair of absolutely unimpeachable central performances.  The movie begins with what can only be described as an unthinkably horrible situation, but this material never once comes across as exploitative in any way, nor does it ever approach conventional thriller territory, which would probably have been the easiest route given the subject matter.  Instead, we have a profoundly sensitive, humane story, and one that is deeply affecting on a number of levels.  Brie Larson does a remarkable job with an enormously difficult role; the level of emotional modulation she displays is striking, and she manages a very delicate and precise balancing act.  It is one of the great performances of 2015, without question.  She's joined by Jacob Tremblay, who gives one of the most winning and effective child performances I've ever seen; it's always unknown how much of a kid's performance is actual acting or the result of manipulation on the part of the director, but whatever the case is here, the result is totally convincing and real.  The movie's transition into its second half is deftly, beautifully handled by director Abrahamson, and the film never descends into histrionics, or emotional shocks for the sake of them.  I wanted to also call attention to the score by Stephen Rennicks, which is lovely and understated when necessary, but also swelling and uplifting when appropriate, and it underlines the proceedings in a wonderful way.  ROOM is not perfect - it's very much a character study, and once we reach the second half, the \"plot,\" so-to-speak, has already resolved itself, and though the second half contains some of the most emotional material, there's nothing in the way of a narrative drive - but it is a very powerful piece of work.",

If it were a young adult novel with fan following, studios would have teared the novel into at-least 2 movies so when one watches it, should remember that he is getting double the fun and why not, Room is a powerful movie with all the elements a blockbuster entertainer lacks these days.\n\nWe open our eyes to the screen and we are in a small room with two inhabitant. We spend a substantial amount of time in that tiny room but never we ever feel suffocated because of the freshness maintained by the director and drop dead performances by both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. One wonders if it is going to be a usual torture or survival movie but it is bigger then that. It is very much common that movies are taking a more realistic and social approach towards crises then that of only physical ones.\n\nRoom is based on a very strong idea and is made by a brilliant director. Performances are of worth watching. Brie Larson is magnificent, although much appreciation should be given to the casting director who opted for her, as most of the praise Brie is getting, is due to the persona she brought to the movie which is different then regular cry baby. And that was the decision of who ever casted her as they at that time gave the movie something other lacked. Jacob Tremblay is brilliant in his role and it's very disappointing to see that many of the award organizations have over looked his work. \n\nAlthough the script is very strong and to the point but the Jacob's escape from the room seemed little weaker. Second half of the movie was much inspired from Irwin Winkler's 'At First Sight' and Clind Eastwood's 'American Sniper. Brie's performance is very good but not as much as she is getting rewarded. As I explained, it's mainly her personality which brought something new into this genre of movie. Rest of the cast were good too. One last mention is for the art designer who worked on the interior of the room which kept us interested in it all the time we spent there.\n\nA work of art in the head of a blessed team.",

And at the same time, it isn't highbrow or overly complicated. \n\nRoom starts out in a padded room with a young boy, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), and his mother, Joy (Brie Larson), lying in a bed together. We're not sure why they're there at first. But eventually we figure things out. Joy was abducted 7 years prior and Jack is her son by her captor. \n\nJoy is a normal mother. She loves her son. She get's annoyed by him from time to time, just as a normal mother would. Everything is not hunky-dory, but the two of them are content there with each other. Or at least Jack is. You can sense, in Joy's eyes, that she is hiding pain. Jack doesn't know of anything that's happened. He knows of no world beyond those walls.\n\nIt's not until about 25 minutes in where we realize what's going on. But we don't mind because the journey there is just as riveting. The plot is revealed very slowly, as the filmmakers let us figure things out on our own, and do well not to spell things out for us. They don't assume the audience is stupid--at least those who are willing to commit to the storytelling. Nothing is ever stated, but we have a grasp on background and character dynamics due to brilliant exposition. \n\nRoom is slow, I admit, but consistent. Director, Lenny Abrahamson knows what he's doing at all times. Besides getting fantastic performances from his leads, I'm thrilled with every choice he makes. From what he includes to what he omits, he understands what's necessary for us to get as organic of an experience possible. This movie could very well be depressing, but it intentionally never stays in one place long enough to do so.\n\nLarson is something to behold in this film. She's pretty much gives as flawless of a performance that anyone possibly can. It's perhaps the best female performance I've ever seen. And Tremblay, for a child, is extremely believable the whole way through. \n\nThe film is ultimately about moving on. And that process can be long and drawn out and never-ending. There are times while watching this film when we ask ourselves how it will end. Not because we want it to, but because we're not even sure how any ending would be enough. But then we find out we're not looking for an ending at all, but a beginning.\n\nTwizard Rating: 100",

Led by incredible work from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, Room makes for an unforgettably harrowing -- and undeniably rewarding -- experience. This drama is as big as all outdoors in scope; poetic and profound in its exploration of the senses; blessed with two transcendent performances, by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay; and as elegantly wrought as any film that has come our way in a very long while. Amazingly - and this movie is amazing - Room is a story of hope, of possibility. Sure, your stomach will be in knots, your fingers clenched, your heart racing. But it will also fill that heart with a sense of the goodness, the courage, the enduring love that is out there to be discovered - and to be held onto with the fierceness of life itself. Director Lenny Abrahamson seamlessly translates Donoghue's work into cinematic terms with his relentlessly compelling adaptation. However, the drama owes just as much to its two stars, Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay, whose textured performances turn outrageous circumstances into a tense and surprisingly credible survival tale. Room is simply a movie about mother and son trying to adapt to the outside world after years of forced captivity. And the surprise is how succinctly it captures this drastic life change from the perspective of five-year-old. \n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

Crazy stuff and really thought-provoking.

It can take you to \"A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far, Far Away\", or it can take you to visit the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" or, sometimes - if you are very lucky - it will take you to ROOM.\n\nDirected by Lenny Abrahamson, ROOM tells the story of \"Ma\" (Brie Larson) who, as the movie begins, has been held hostage for 7 years in a windowless 10x10 enclosure.  She has dubbed this enclosure \"ROOM\" for the benefit of her 5 year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who is held imprisoned with her.  The first half of the movie takes place entirely in this enclosure where Ma has helped create a world for Jack.  It is very much Ma taking care of Jack.  The second half of the movie takes place \"afterward\" (I will not spoil anything here).\n\nMs. Larson, in her Oscar nominated role, is fantastic as Ma, imbuing her character with the right combination of strength and weakness of one imprisoned for so long, but you can see the love she has for her son and that she will do anything to protect him.  While the first half of the movie is worthy of her Oscar nomination (and Oscar frontrunner status), it is the realistic affects to Ma (who we find out is named, ironically, Joy) during \"afterwards\" that really cement the role.  We don't see a \"superwoman\" here, we see a real person dealing with a traumatic event and it's aftermath.  She is ably assisted by strong turns by Joan Allen and William H. Macy as her parents, as well as Tom McCamus as \"Leo\".\n\nThe surprise for me is how strong a performance 9 year old Jacob Tremblay gave as 5 year old Jack.  While Larson, rightfully so, is receiving critical acclaim, I am surprised that Tremblay isn't receiving more.  Larson is the rock of the first half of the movie, but  it is Tremblay who holds the 2nd half of the movie together.  Jack's warm and loving soul radiates throughout the back half and keeps things together when it looks like things are falling apart.\n\nDirector Abrahamson gives a strong hand to the proceedings, having us focus on just what we need to focus on without it becoming too depressing, maudlin or sappy.  He knows when to pull in and when to pull out and has you rooting for these characters from the start.\n\nThis movie is not for everyone and I am sure that more than 1 person will have a tough time making it all the way through it (I had a strong desire to go home and hug my family afterward, much to my son's chagrin).  I was warmed by the strong love of mother and son and how it takes a subject that could have been a downer and has made it heartwarming and life affirming.\n\n4 (out of 5) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",

The actors are excellent, Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack create a home/neighborhood/community/country  inside a small, cluttered \"room\" with occasional shafts of light beaming down from a skylight that displays the stars and moving clouds - the outside \"world\" a dream beyond their reach.\n\n A television sputtering on the blink allows that other \"world\" entry, but for young Jack, what he sees flickering on the screen is both real and \"make believe\" ; distinctions have been erased and are unknowable. The relationship between mother and child is stunning - the  connection between them is acutely poignant, as if the umbilical cord had never been severed. Days are spent exercising, running back and forth- sharp turns are necessary after a few steps, making us aware of the claustrophobic feel of the space; and Ma's attempt to teach her son to read and maintain a somewhat \"normal\" existence is impressive and heart-rending. Jack's poetic and descriptive use of words to describe his circumscribed environment invokes the originality and charm of expressing and interpreting  what we see and feel through language tailored to one's unique cosmos. We also witness the chilling visits of \"Old Nick\" her captor whose step on the stairs on his way to the \"room\" is a sign for little Jack to hide and feign sleep behind a shuttered closet door - the presence of \"evil\" glimpsed through cracks in the battered and weatherworn slats.\n\nWhen Jack turns five his mother decides he is old enough to participate in an escape plan involving resilience and courage which eventually succeeds. Mother and child are hospitalized and the second half of ROOM begins. How to acclimate one's self to being separate individuals, after the powerful link between them is sundered - a tie which was both nourishing and restrictive? Accommodation to \"freedom\" begins, and the aching awareness of the familiar becoming unfamiliar, as well as the unfamiliar becoming familiar, are daunting and formidable.\n\n\nROOM is an exquisitely fragile story of the pliancy of the human resolve to survive and adapt to suffocating circumstances and adjust to the shock of change after flight and rescue. A child's ability to embrace the magic of his new environs - as one Dr. mentioned in examining Jack, \"he is still plastic\"; and an adult's more complex road to acclimatization which includes grieving the loss of a singular bond where the \"other\" completes you to the exclusion of everyone else.",

Joy's days are spent creating as normal of a childhood as she can for her son Jack - full of daydreams and exercise and crafts - so that at night when Old Nick comes for his conjugal visit, Jack would never think that hiding in the wardrobe is out of the ordinary. Now that he has turned five years old, Joy deems him old enough to learn the truth and plan their escape. \n\nAnd what a riveting escape it is. I've laughed at movies, cried at movies, jumped out of my seat and yelped at movies, but never has my heart raced so fast at a movie as when Jack struggles to disentangle himself from the carpet and scrabbles out of this moving, rumbling behemoth into a loud, populated, alien world he has never seen, much less imagined before. \n\nNine-year-old Jacob Tremblay is so utterly natural as Jack, expressing shades of joy, anger, amusement, disgust, doubt, fear, and working that raggedy mop of hair to boot. My favorite moment is when Joy makes Jack repeatedly practice unrolling from the rug, and a disheveled, out-of-breath Jack tumbles out and spouts, \"I hate you!\" There is such power in his vehemence. Brie Larson is pretty dang good, infusing this young abuse victim with motherly patience and motherly ferocity, but I suppose she was good in an expected way. I expected a performance of this character to be this way, so I didn't see any surprising distinctions. In fact, the post-Room scenes with the reporter or fighting with her mom seem a bit inorganic, both in script and acting. There isn't enough nuance about Joy's PTSD; all the dialogue is too on-the-nose, so both Larson and Joan Allen end up just yelling in one note.\n\nThere are some weird must-happens in the story, of course. Old Nick must either be \"kind\" or dumb enough to not abuse his child begat from abuse, to not look inside the rug to confirm his child's death, to not wrestle his child back into the truck after his escape attempt, to not go home right away to punish his prisoner-wife. I mean, the audience probably wouldn't be able to handle more atrocity, but I wanted at least some background on what kind of abuser he is and what happens to him after the news broke. I know it's not his story, nor would a real life person like him deserve more consideration, but for a fictional character, he needs some grounding traits. What would compel the reporter to ask Joy why she didn't just have Old Nick take baby Jack to a hospital so that he may have a normal life? That would take an inordinate amount of trust in the abuser. And what if the rug were placed so that it would roll INTO the truckbed wall? And wouldn't Joy's friends have been affected by her disappearance and be interested/happy to know that she made it out alive?",

Brie Larson was also pretty damn incredible, and deserves all the awards that have been coming her way. My enjoyment of the film itself was a bit different for each of its two halves. I loved everything that took place inside of \"Room\", and all of the stuff that happened immediately afterward.

Brie Larson performs her Oscar-worthy performance as a kidnapped woman, broken by the present events, who relies on her innocent son to keep her alive hopeful. Along with a miraculous performance by the young Jacob Tremblay, who manages to carry the film with his coming-of-age performance of a child who does not understand how the world is operated and must learn to adapt to a new lifestyle. Through the camerawork, the audience is able to see how this world functions through the eyes of a naive young boy. With this, viewers are able to understand the innocence and confusion of seeing the world for the first time. The story of a kidnapped mother and her son may appear as a by-the-numbers thriller, but when the story provides fascinating characters, wonderful acting performances, and emotional depth that allows the time to rapidly fly as viewers become vastly engrossed within each character and their inner struggles, the film becomes one of the most unique films made in the past several years. Overall, Room is an emotional roller coaster that will remain within the audience's minds for the next several weeks after the viewing.",

Words cannot fully describe the experience of watching this film as it is directed to perfection by Lenny Abrahamson who shoots the mundane world like a fairytale and it's a great reminder of how beautiful our world is and how often we take life for granted. The film stars Brie Larson as the mother named Joy, who was kidnapped at seventeen, routinely raped, and upon being impregnated, gave birth to a son she names, Jack, played by Jacob Tremblay in what may be the finest acting performance I've ever seen from a child! Larson is spellbinding with a very tough role to tackle, her range of emotions constantly changing due to her situation, and Tremblay matches her skills perfectly and he arguably had the tougher role having to convey the sense of wonder and discovery upon seeing the outside world for the first time. The first half of this film is infuriating, yet hopeful as you witness their day-to-day lives in \"Room\" and how their captor only stops by to drop off food and disgustingly rape the mother, but once they make their escape, the film switches tones and we get to see the inspirational side to the story as they begin to assimilate back into society. Once they're free we get great supporting work from Joan Allen and William H. Macy who play Joy's parents who finally get to reunite with their daughter after disappearing seven years prior and the resolution there I will not spoil, but it is heartbreaking. This film is beautiful, haunting, depressing, and uplifting with two flat-out AMAZING lead performances and flawless directing, though I'm not sure I ever need to watch it again, it is a film I will never forget.",

            "content": "A heartbreaking work of staggering genius set in a confined space, this harrowing ripped-from-the-headlines drama manages to give filmgoers the world through true acting and pure emotion. Dave Eggers' memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius gets namechecked above even though the author and Emma Donoghue, writer and screenwriter of this film and its celebrated source material (based very loosely on the long-term Ariel Castro kidnapping of two young women), share little in common so far as tone and content. In regards to Room, however, the words themselves just fit. Room's title, for instance, couldn't be more succinct and less hyperbolic. Like the setting itself, it boxes in our mind's eye at the outset, holding us as captive as the victims at its center. Just as with real estate, the success of a film sometimes comes down to location, location, location. This was never more the case for a cinematic work than with Room. The setting restricts our characters and us by proxy, but director Lenny Abrahamson smartly doesn't let us feel boxed in until it suits the story. The camerawork, performances, and dialogue pulls us into their postage stamp-sized home with a love and understanding that could conversely fill the universe...just before this 'world' drops out from everybody.\n\nIn this R-rated drama, five-year-old Jack (Tremblay) and his mother (Larson) escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, which causes the boy to make a thrilling discovery about life. \n\nWith graceful economy, Brie Larson conveys the courageous but depressive depth of a mother who knows that there's a whole world for her child to discover outside of four confining walls, but smartly chooses to keep this secret close to her chest for fear of his psychological undoing. Newcomer Tremblay, on the other hand, gives as good as he gets with this situation, electrifying audiences from the get-go. Their creativity and humanity in the face of shear evil makes for a powerful lesson that the film lays out with great but careful intelligence. Powerful in subject matter alone, the film could've gone astray when the world opens up to them, but director Lenny Abrahamson keeps focus on the engrossing performances, which compels all involved forward. Indeed, we're already so sympathetically invested in their journey that we feel the mother's gut-wrenching mental anguish when a reporter questions if her decision not to have her captor give Jack away as a baby was what was best for the child. Perhaps, Room's only weak point is the fact that the performances achieve such a level of perfection that the other aspects of the production can never equal that breathtaking excellence. Authentic to the last, no member of the cast speaks a false line or makes a wrong move, especially a mother and kid combo that defines flawless chemistry and provide filmgoer with the year's most uplifting story.  \n\nBottom line: Efficiency Compartment",

The first half of the movie is incredibly tense, the second half extremely emotionally wrought. I don't normally like children in anything, but some of the most beautiful sections of the film are Jacob Tremblay describing his understanding of fundamental aspects of his life and the world as his reality changes violently around him. And the kid screams a lot, not as much as the kid in The Babadook, but a lot. In all seriousness, I haven't cried from a movie this much since The Fox and the Hound.

However, the direction of Lenny Abrahamson and writing of Emma Donoghue, in conjunction with breathtaking performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, make for a film so hauntingly beautiful that you'll forget how tragic it truly is. \nPossibly the most brilliant thing about Room is the way Abrahamson is able to make an inherently rotten situation seem so magical through the eyes of a child. Max lives in a single room and sleeps in a closet, a life so representative of Hell that the film goes as far as to name the person keeping him there 'Old Nick', another name for The Devil. However, Max's love for life reminds a cynical audience of the blissful ignorance of childhood, or maybe the ignorance of adulthood depending on your perspective. By focusing on Max, you almost forget about the horror of the situation you are watching and the inhumanity that is present. It is an incredible feat in filmmaking.\nHowever, Room is not perfect. In fact, Room is inherently flawed. It is a film that feels more like two films than one and subsequently leads to a very jarring experience for the viewer. The first half of Room is one of the best pieces of cinema ever made. It is sweet, subtle, layered, heart-warming, incredibly suspenseful and inherently terrifying. However, the following hour of film is... fine. It's definitely not bad and doesn't completely take away from the film, it just feels anti-climactic. We have an opening hour where the stakes are at their highest, the characters' lives are on the line and you feel like yours is too. However, what follows can only be described as therapy, as we watch many boring sequences of our protagonists dealing with the events of the first half of the film. It doesn't serve much of a purpose but to prolong the narrative, leaving the viewer feeling like they've seen what they came to see and now they're watching an hour of footage made solely for the purpose of making the film two hours long. \nOverall, Room is a special kind of film. You will love the first hour, it is one of the most delicately beautiful sequences of film you'll ever see. Everything after that is throwaway; but it's well-written, well-directed and well-acted throwaway, so at least you'll have that.",

But it's also the kind of experience that left me speechless, and a movie that I find so unforgettable. Something I hadn't felt maybe in a while.\n\nThe story of \"Room\" is about a relationship between Joy \"Ma\" Newsome (played by Brie Larson), and her five-year-old skeptical son named Jack Newsome (played by Jacob Tremblay). The first half of the film focused on Ma and Jack of where they're trapped inside of a 10-by-10 foot space garden shed, which they call it \"Room.\" What they've  been doing over there is making arts and crafts, baking deserts, playing games, watching TV, and a whole bunch more. But the one main thing that Ma was trying to do for herself is to keep Jack optimistic. She is saying many things to him that are so made up and it's all because she's trying to keep him happy, protected, and unafraid. Later in the film, Ma had decided that she and Jack are going to escape, but before that, she must tell him the truth about this place they're in, and that \"Old Nick\" (played by Sean Bridgers) is not who Jack thinks he is. He's actually the father of Jack, and the one who abducted Ma and put her in this shed for seven years.\n \nSo after they escaped, this leads us to the second half of the film of where Ma and Jack were recovered in the hospital. We then see that everything's different with Ma's parents. Jack's life starts to get really big when he makes a shocking discovery: the real world. Ma's life, on the other hand, is starting to shrink, meaning that she is feeling devastated. For someone like her who's been in that garden shed for seven years, that's hard to get through.\n\nYou know, I don't remember saying this to myself but I find the clips of \"Room\" more effective than the trailer. Watching the movie, however, is actually even better. Seeing that this is a movie about a relationship between Ma and her son Jack, and having him look up to the world for the first time, that's where things get very fascinating to me. The central relationship in this film is probably one of the best relationships I've ever seen so far. The way how director Lenny Abrahamson and screenwriter Emma Donoghue, (who wrote the novel), present the details to both the main story and the central relationship in a very raw, honest, and challenging manner. As far as the other things that the film goes on, such as Jack's imagination, I find them to be very convincing and believable.\n    \nThere are many reasons to why I really like Brie Larson's performance in \"Short Term 12.\" As for \"Room,\" I found her performance to be superior. For a character that has so much pain, so much misery, and so much care, Brie Larson delivers it, and I absolutely found her character to be very believable. The most remarkable thing I can say about Jacob Tremblay is not only that he is the most adorable young actor I've ever seen so far, but he's also the most perfect young actor for playing this kind of character. Every scene that he's in just blew me away. I like every single bit of his dialogue, especially the line that I brought earlier in my review. I've also realized that he's going to be in a lot of movies this year. The one movie that I'm very excited to watch this year, which he is a part of it, is Colin Trevorrow's \"The Book of Henry.\" Joan Allen is terrific as Jack's Grandmother. It was very weird for me that William H. Macy wasn't in the movie all that much, but in the few moments that he was in, he was very good.\n\nThe only thing in \"Room\" that made me feel more sad than the scene of where Ma and Jack are hugging emotionally after they were separated for like a couple hours, (which I almost cried in that scene), was that it had to end. Technically, it was one of those movies that I wanted it to keep going and never stop.\n   \n\"Room\" has got to be the most unforgettable and breathtaking film I've ever seen. I do hope that there are other people who will experience this the same way I experienced the film.  I mean, yes, it can be grim, and yes, the film is very emotional, but everything about it, (the performances, the direction, the screenplay), is so remarkable, and that is why \"Room\" is the best film of 2015 in my opinion. 4/4",

The Martian is about the role of human resourcefulness in surviving hostile conditions when others have lost hope. And here is Room, an absolutely wonderful film about a mother's love for her child and shielding them from the true horror even when in the most awful of predicaments.\n\nIt has to be said from the outset that it is not just a Fritzl film. It is not simply an exploitation film though that this clearly there in the background. That is not to say that the first half of the film is easy to watch. However, we are shielded from the worst of it much like how Jack is by his mother. For Ma, Room is a living hell but for Jack, \"Room\" is his whole world that goes in \"every direction, all the way to the end\". \n\nAs the trailer shows, the entire running time is not dedicated to the confines of the room but how the two- particularly Jack- cope in the real world. We see this strange new place often directly through the eyes of the young child and being able to hear his internal monologue was just so cute yet incredibly emotional.\n\nThe direction from Lenny Abrahamson is simply outstanding and the two central performances from Larson and Tremblay were perfect. As disturbing as it is at times, what a life-affirming film Room is.",

The police, doctors, press- none of it rings true which renders it mostly uninteresting.  Brie Larson does deserve all the awards (she reminds me a little of JLaw in \"Winter's Bone\") but her performance is dependent on the amazingly fine acting of then eight-year-old Jacob Tremblay.  I'm looking forward to seeing where they both go from here. Joan Allen has never been disappointing to me since I saw her in \"Say Goodnight, Gracie\" in 1982, but Bill Macy, whom I first saw on stage almost forty years ago in Mamet's \"The Water Engine,\" comes off as, \"Why am I even in this movie?\"",

            "content": "Room is the smallest in scale and scope of the 2015 Best Picture nominees, and also feels the most intimate. The premise seems challenging and unpleasant: a young woman and her five-year-old son are being held against their will in a shed in someone's backyard. The focus of the film, however, is the relationship between mother and son. Room is the only one of this year's Best Picture nominees which I probably would not have seen without the nomination; however, I'm glad that I saw it. It's a well-constructed, emotionally effective drama.\n\nRoom is a film in two parts: inside \"Room\" and outside of it, back in the world. The story is simple, but more than adequate to fill out Room's two-hour runtime. The movie opens with Jack narrating his day and surroundings. To hide the unpleasant, harsh reality of their situation his Ma, played by Brie Larson, has told Jack that \"Room\" is the entire world, everything they see on TV, cartoon and people alike, isn't real. She has also kept the truth about his father, their captor, from young Jack. Ma does everything she can to make a normal life for Jack in \"Room\" and does surprisingly well. Their daily routine is not unlike any other parent and child's daily normal routine: brushing teeth, cooking food, TV time, story time. Perhaps most helpful of all is that they refer to objects in \"Room\" without articles, making everything in their little prison seem friendly. Jack wakes up and says \"Good Morning, Clock.\" When their captor, referred to only as \"Old Nick,\" visits and abuses Ma, Jack hides in \"Wardrobe.\" \n\nJack's narration, which guides us both inside and outside of \"Room\" fits the film well and, fortunately, is not cutesy the way movies often present the thoughts of children on the mysterious adult world. Brie Larson is nominated for Best Actress and seems to have a decent shot at taking home the Oscar. I'm not sure that Larson would get my vote for Best Actress, but there is no denying she gives a good performance and is really believable as a woman making the most of an unpleasant situation and as a mother taking care of and protecting her son the best she can.\n\nI think Larson's work in the first half of the film is what will earn her any accolades. When I think of the second half of the movie, outside of \"Room\" and especially once they leave the hospital, Ma is largely absent from my memory. That half of the movie is Jack's story. The young actor playing Jack, Jacob Tremblay, is good as a 5-year-old with a skewed view of the world and, like his narration, is not cloying or precocious. In a scene at the hospital, a doctor tells Ma that Jack will be able to adjust to the outside world because he's still plastic. Jack whispers to his mother that he's not plastic, he's real; he is equally as endearing and annoying as I think any five-year-old is likely to behave. Likewise, Larson's believability as a mother is due to her scenes of frustration with her son, for good reasons and sometimes not, as much as the scenes of her motherly love. \n\nRoom is not as entirely dour and soul-wrenching as you might except from its premise. Its focus is the effect of the crime and abuse that's happened to the characters, not the actual crime itself. Room is ultimately a family drama, concerned with the character's interactions and relationships to each other. Jack's slowly growing curiosity about the real world is helped by his relationship with his grandmother, played well by Joan Allen, and step-grandfather, Leo, played with low-key warmth by Tom McCamus. \n\nThe movie has a chance to take a hard turn into Lifetime made-for-TV movie territory after Ma and Jack escape and a swarm of reporters descend upon her mother's house. Thankfully, Room's script is smart enough to keep the press barrage on the edges and to keep the focus on Jack. We stay with Jack, who is only peripherally aware of the conversations between the adults saying long sentences about lawyers, a possible trial, bills, and a TV interview. Ma agrees to one TV interview to cover expenses and the movie keeps that scene short. The movie keeps us with Jack, sneaking around a corner to peek at what's happening. Many more scenes are done similarly and the movie is all the better for it. Brie Larson is the star of the movie, but our narrative lenspiece is young Jack, aware and understanding in his own way the things he hears and sees.\n\nBecause Room is based on a best-selling novel, many viewers may know the story already (the fact that Ma and Jack escape from their captor was even revealed in film's the trailer), but even knowing how the story plays out does not make the visits of Old Nick to \"Room\" and Jack's escape any less tense. \n\nRoom is certainly well-made, but there is not too much that stands out to me about its direction, though Lenny Abrahamson is nominated for Best Director. Where Abrahamson succeeds best is in making the viewer feel like a fly on the wall in \"Room.\" Even after they escape their captivity and are thrown into the outside world the movie keeps us close to Ma and Jack. The more I think about Room the more I realize that what I liked about the movie had to do with its story and structure which stem from the screenplay by Emma Donoghue, based on her novel. The screenplay, performances, and wonderful score by Stephen Rennicks, are what elevate Room from being a made-for-TV fare or a dark, dour crime story. There may be a misstep or two (like the canted camera angles to show Jack's disorientation with the outside world), but overall the film works well and delivers big pathos. Room is definitely a tear-jerker, there's no way around that, whether you have kids or not. It's about family and stepping out of your own private world, in this case a world that wasn't asked for, and into the wide world of everyone and everything else. I liked this movie, but critics and audiences loved Room. It made its way onto many critics' best of the year lists, so it should be no surprise that it is included in the Academy's list as well.",

            "content": "\"When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know everything!\"\n\nIt doesn't feel right to call Lenny Abrahamson's latest film a small one because it is such a rewarding and emotional experience. Yes, it is a low key and small scaled film, but it has such a profound impact on the audience that it is far from being small. The first half of the film takes place in a very confined space, which makes the second half of the movie even more rewarding as the world around these two protagonists expands. Very few times in film has a director captured such an interesting and authentic mother and son dynamic as we find here with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's performances. Larson is guaranteed to win the Oscar for her lead role here and she fully deserves it as this mother who has endured the worst of times, but found a means of surviving through her son. She truly lives a nightmare, but Abrahamson doesn't focus on that as much as he does at making us experience their  world through the young son's eyes. He is innocent and has never seen the world outside of the small room in which he unknowingly has been held captive since his birth. His mother has done everything she can to give him a happy and normal life despite the situation. Tremblay delivers an equally impressive performance, and his young age shouldn't have been a factor when it came to voting for the best performances of the year. He was outstanding and held his own in each scene he shared with Larson. The two performances are the main reason why Room has achieved such greatness. \n\nRoom is based on Emma Donoghue's best selling novel about a 5 year old boy who experiences the world in the confined space of a small room. The only person he has direct contact with is his mother. His only contact with the outside world is through a small TV, but his mother has told him that the images are of other universes far from theirs. Jack also knows there is one other person that exists in their world, as some nights a visitor comes into the room from a locked door, but his mom orders him to keep away from him and stay in his wardrobe. Jack's mother has done her best to give him love and nurture, but as his curiosity begins to grow there is only so far she can go with her story. What will happen when young Jack realizes that there is actually more to the world than the small room in which they have been confined in? What follows is a deeply emotional and profound thriller that shook me to my core. \n\nLenny Abrahamson is known for delivering original and unconventional stories. Previously to Room he had directed Michael Fassbender in Frank, a film in which the main protagonist wore a giant paper-mache mask throughout the story. Room however goes a step further delivering a thriller in a very unconventional way as we get to experience the harrowing events through the innocence of a five year old boy and the depths his mother goes through to give him a normal life. From the very opening scene we know there is nothing normal about their lifestyle, but at the same time the film avoids the typical atmosphere we are used to seeing in crime related films. I don't want to say too much about Room because the less you know about it the better, but the second half delivers even more thrills and engages the audience with even more to ponder about. Finding freedom is only have of the battle, and most of the time these films fail to focus on it, but Room manages to deliver on both ends. This is an effective and powerful film and I'm finding it incredibly hard to put into words how much it affected me.",

This movie is a haunting look at the emotional & survival aspects of child abduction seen through the eyes of a young boy. That boy's name is Jack; his mother Joy was abducted as a teen and held captive for numerous years. The despicable excuse for a human being who abducted Joy impregnated her and the result was Jack. The first half of the movie is captured in the shed \"room\" where Joy & Jack are held captive and it shows them both go through their normal daily routine, and their mother to child interactions. It is very disturbing to watch, but so resounding in how their resiliency holds them through. Jack is blinded to much of the world due to his captivity, and only envisions to be reality on what he sees on television; this is brilliantly presented by screenwriter Emma Donoghue who adapted the script from her novel. The second half of \"Room\" is stored in the aspects of adjusting to the real world after Joy & Jack are able to free their captor. Director Lenny Abrahamson helms the picture with a commanding orchestration of the inner emotional layers that Joy & Jack go through their experience in captivity and adjusting; my only minor critique of \"Room\" was in the film's unrealistic ending which obviously I won't reveal because there is no room for spoilers in my reviews. Brie Larson was astounding as Joy, and this is the real Joy who will be the next Oscar winner for Best Actress. Jacob Tremblay as Jack was a revelation, and this young actor is heading straight to the real world of stardom; he is a genuine pure talent. There was also strong supporting work from Joan Allen as Joy's mother, William H. Macy as Joy's father, and Tom McCamus as the boyfriend of Joy's mom. OK, I will free you now from this review, sorry I held you captive with all those roomy puns. Just make sure you make room for \"Room\".",

To say that Brie Larson deserves the Oscar this year for her performance would be an understatement, but just as deserving, if not more so, would be Jacob Tremblay.. I felt his fears, understood his excitement and longed for him to understand what was out in the real world. Quite often films brush past the children to look at the more complex emotions of adults, but that would have been a great disservice. Jack is the heart of the story, and seeing it play out from his perspective is far more interesting. We rediscover the beauty of our world in the two hour span of the film. The script is top notch, the performances beautiful and I find myself thinking about the film even now, days after seeing it. This may be my new film of the year.

I would say any movie in which a young child plays a\n major role falls into that category for me, particularly one that I know will feature a great deal of mother/child bonding, temper tantrums, and a child screaming and pouting  in excess. I sensed what I was in for with this movie, yet I wanted to see it anyway so I put my usual aversion aside. Overall, the movie delivers exactly the powerful performances promised in glowing reviews. It also did not prove to be grating in the interaction between mother and child, despite a few scenes of bratty outbursts and (believable) intense mother/child squabbling or attempting to communicate in very difficult circumstances. This is a movie that could've derailed if the female lead had overly milked the emotion and despair, but it's a rather understated performance, which is exactly why it is so powerful. (Brie Larson has the Oscar sewn up). I have no idea how they get such a performance out of a child, but the kid was great. Most surprising of all was the \"bad guy\" in the movie, but I won't ruin it by saying anything more about that element other than that it surprised me and added much to the movie's effectiveness. This has been a great year for Irish films and film-makers, and this movie is every bit as good as \"Brooklyn\".  Whatever nominations and awards it gets will be well-deserved as it is a most affecting movie. Other than the soundtrack music, which came on a bit too strong in a few scenes, I  have nothing negative to say about this outstanding film.",

While it is clear that the story morbidly revolves around exploring the progressive reassimilation of being trapped in a box and then subsequently introduced to a much grander world through the lens of a young boy, the progression of the story insists on several nagging and unresolved plot points.\n\nThe treatment for Brie Larson's character as a mother recovering from the horrific trauma of being abducted at youth and then being impregnated by her abductor, is insufficiently explored and leaves us wondering about her post traumatic state throughout the entirety of the movie. It is made clear that the star is evidently young Jake and his coming to terms with the \"new world,\" but our attention seems to be tugged by the interactions between Ma and her parents, her doctor, and the insisting presence of the media pushing for that frustratingly cold interview. All of which prove Ma's maternal devotions to her son Jake while giving the audience only speculative evidence to the state of a suggestive decline of her character, who we grew to genuinely care about very early into the film. Whether the incident in the bathroom was deliberate or accidental, little evidence is given to suggest an absolution, if any, to her decision - which then begs at the well being of the loved and adored Jake under the beck and call of the potential volatility of his mother.\n\nOverall Room was an interesting and original take on abduction and the morbid realities of rebuilding a life after the fact. It fell short on exploring the voice of a young mother's post traumatic state, while too much focus was spent on an under articulated exploration in the psychology and physiology of young boy being introduced to society for the first time in his life. It is not to insist that all of these resolutions questioned would further the point of the story's revolving focus on Jake however, i found the execution of some of the topics brought up in dialogue to be blatantly unignorable and found myself craving for several resolutions at the end of the film due to this dialogue, which were not met.",

Unfortunately, I was aware of some of the things that were happening, which would have been a delightful surprise to discover.  I open with this because I want to urge you all, if you know nothing about Room, then make sure you stay that way and go see this film. The less you know when you walk in on that day will make the movie that much more exciting.  Spoilers from here on:  I loved the performances from all the actors in this film.  The 2 leads (mother and son) were particularly amazing.  The first half of the film was gut-wrenching and left me in despair, as is intended.  This also made the transition point in the middle of the film, the escape, one of the most heart-pounding and intense things I've ever sat through in a theater.  It was one of those scenes where I almost couldn't contain myself and wanted to shout at the character on screen.  It's after this point that I had the most difficulty with Room.  The pace, and intensity dropped off precipitously when they left Room.  While everything felt very genuine and realistic, and I totally cared about the characters still, the dramatic change in tone was hard to adjust to that quickly.  It basically walks you through how, despite physically being free, they were still mentally trapped in Room.  It's so tough because, like the main character, I assumed freedom would mean an instant big happy ending to the film, but that's not reality.  Room is a superb film that has dark events and themes, and yet manages to hold an underlying message of hope despite devastating circumstances.",

Dark, frustratingly depressing at moments and capable of making you feel uncomfortable, this movie offers a formidable dramatic challenge which grows into a thoughtful character study.\n\nThe story of a young kidnapped girl (Brie Larson) and her young boy kept in captivity could not be less than uncomfortable and hart-to-chew. From the first moments, the audience will be compelled to follow how Joy managed to survive so many years being locked in a room and to raise a boy. The slow, detailed revelation of the true situation works formidably on the audience as it meticulously builds-up the story into the second part of the movie. The second half might be a less thrilling one, but if offers an intriguing character study of how Joy and Jack cope with the freedom and the return to the society. That is also the most polarizing part of Lenny Abrahamson's movie. If you are impressed with the first half, then the second one will certainly feel less satisfying. Personally, I would have preferred to have the whole movie focused on the \"Room\" rather than part of it.\n\nThe weaker second half is, however, compensated by the wonderful performances of Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Both of them were worthy of receiving Oscar nominations, and the young Larson even snapped the Best Actress Award. Her extremely believable performance, her struggle to get used to freedom and her almost aggressive and uncontrollable love for her boy are contributing greatly to the overall high emotional load in the movie. On the hand, Jacob Tremblay's performance is outstanding as well. His young age probably deprived him from obtaining a nomination but his fascinating presence as Jack certainly puts him among the list of top kids-actors to be followed.\n\nIn conclusion, Room is a must see delivery. Not only because of the Oscar-winning performance of Brie Larson, but also because of the compelling and uneasy story , and wonderful screenplay.",

Through Room, I particularly loved how the maternal love was portrayed more than just how a mother can be protective of her son, but it also shapes her into what she is: I just couldn't imagine how Joy's life, and identity for that matter, would look like without Jack in that room. The second layer of subtleties is our well familiar \"world\" but as seen from a uniquely fresh perspective of a five-year-old who didn't know it \"existed.\" All these were achieved by the genius adaptation of the namesake novel and the incredibly visceral performance of Brie and Jacob.\n\nBrie, I honestly didn't believe that you were just 26 (or even younger at the time of shooting)! How could a woman your age portray this complex character with such deep emotions and subtleties? Just brilliant, very brilliant, indeed. I'd be disappointed if you don't get the Oscar.\"",

We follow them as Jack discovers, explores, and has to adapt to a world he didn't even know existed till now, and Ma struggles with her increasingly fragile mental state. Brie Larson does a great job, Joan Allen as her mother was fantastic, but Jacob Tremblay easily steals the entire show. I'd go so far as to say he was the best performance I've seen this year (It's a joy to watch him discover this new world for the first time). We also spend the most time with Jack as he is our eyes and ears into the movie, and he is the main character here. Room is a gentle, loving, sad, and life affirming film. It's easily one of the year's best (It's also easily the most emotional film of the year), and while it is super slow I will say it is most definitely worth a watch.",

But in the interest of not giving out any spoilers, I will leave it at that.)\n\nThis is the first feature film for child actor Jacob Tremblay. His performance is magnificent and one of the best in recent years for someone of his age.\n\nThe film beautifully captures the family dynamics of not only between mother and son but also the immediate family when a child is suddenly abducted. Thankfully, many of us will never be in this situation. But what gives this film its weight is the striking enactment of the aftermath and emotions when placed in such a situation, which are engrossing and deeply moving.\n\n\"Room\" is captivating as it tells its daunting story through the eyes of a five-year-old as much as it does from its adult victim.",

This is the story you get!\", punctuates their situation, and ultimately our own desires, with such force it nearly knocked me out. Room, a powerhouse of horrifying drama and real-life suspense, breaks out from its confining premise with enough gentle moments of love to make it one of the year's best.\nIf you can't tell, I'm being careful with the details of the plot. However, know that it's a setup that's about as bleak as one can imagine. Director Abrahamson (maker of the criminally underrated Frank) creates an atmosphere of intensely palpable desperation in his small sets. In lesser hands, Room could've been either an oppressively gloomy downer or dishonestly optimistic hack-job. Instead, it's both strikingly candid and beautifully grace-filled\nThis compassion for its subjects is thanks in no small part to the much-deserved-Oscar-nominated Larson, and young actor Tremblay. His character, in particular, presents such a powerful look at childish naïveté, he gives us one of the most amazing examples childhood trauma and perseverance I've ever seen. That theme (determination through suffering) creates an experience that harbors as much exhilaration as it does tears. Piercing and gut-wrenching, Room is a film you may want to escape, but will be glad you endured.",

The film opens up in medias res with this young mother in her seventh year of captivity, trying to survive in squalid conditions with her young son and teach him about a world he has never seen.  The first act shows some of the most claustrophobic and focused filmmaking this year.  We are stuck with these characters in this doomed situation, with only hints of the outside world.  Brie Larson impresses us as the young woman who was denied years of her life and we see how her imprisonment and its aftermath have worn on her.  Jacob Tremblay also deserves some recognition for convincingly playing a boy who has never traveled more than five feet from where he was born and never met a person other than his mother.  Room loses steam toward the end and fails to recapture the engrossing magic that had us at the edge of our seat for the first 35 minutes, but it still has a simple and definitive end that most awards season fare denies the audience.

            "content": "ROOM Review - Jack Fitzpatrick\n\nSimply put, \"Room\" is an emotional film. And it seems as though half the time you do not even know what you're feeling. Seamlessly the film manages to portray happiness in a tragic way, depressingly dark situations yet also present some optimism and make you feel genuinely scared and/or worried about its fictional characters. Room is emotional in a very real sense; it's not just another movie where a romance falls apart, or where a loved one gets a terminal illness and it doesn't tug on your heart strings with cheap bullshit. Room doesn't try to trick you into feeling things, its realistic tone and grim story is enough. Not to make light of the cinematography, music or any of anything else which made the film, these are all good too, however we are really in this one for the writing and acting; the story and characters. \nThe film follows its protagonists as they live their day to day lives trapped inside a small dirty room with no way out. Locked in by a nameless man that they call 'Old Nick,' (Who by the way totally looks like Will Ferrell's cousin or something...) The characters are a mother and son 'Jack,' 'Ma' has been inside this room for seven years and her son has never experienced anything beyond the room in his life. For around half of the movie we stay in the room with these characters, we as an audience never leave the room until the characters do. Personally I was beginning to feel the claustrophobia myself, the movie makes you feel as trapped as the characters are. The room feels hopeless as it does small and the atmosphere is actually quite haunting. \nNow though, that Jack is five years old, Ma believes that it's now time and that he is finally old enough to help her make their escape. Through a series of events, the two do make it out of the room, however we are still only about half way through the film as we follow their lives after leaving 'room.' \nThe films point of no return; leaving 'room' is both scary and cheerful for both us and the characters in the film. The juxtaposition of being stuck in the room and the freedoms of such an open and unknown world is mind blowing. Yet, before they leave and it is uncertain whether they will succeed or not, you almost don't want them to try. Jack pleads his mother to wait till he is six years old and this is a terrifying theme throughout the film; Comfort and security over freedom. Jack's life and world may have been horrible, however the thought of leaving was frightening and almost made no sense to Jack. \nThe movie manages to portray a horrible situation without feeling like a cheap horror movie, this is to be taken seriously and manages to portray despicable acts and conditions of the characters, without reverting to gross out moments or cartoonish dark villains. The villain of the film, is definitely disgusting and hateable, but ultimately is not the point of the film. The maturity of the film dealing with a sickening character and subject is appreciated. \nAnother running theme of this film was the experience - or really inexperience of five-year-old Jack. He'd never known anything beyond this one room his entire life, basically; 'room' was his world. And this is such an interesting concept to me. Jack's concepts of fiction and reality blur and at such an age he is vulnerable to information. It's important to learn the truth however almost incomprehensible due to his extremely limited knowledge. \n\nPossibly my favourite shot of the film, has Jack creating shadows with his hands in the partial sunlight that comes through via sunlight. This shot has obvious relation to 'The Allegory of the Cave' philosophical theory. Put simply, if a caveman never leaves his cave, and all he ever sees are shadows, this is what he believes in, this becomes his reality. And the same goes for the child in the film. 'Room' is all he knows, and beyond stories he's told or what he sees on their television, Jack's sense of reality is inaccurate. He knows about animals such as dogs and cats, he knows about grass and trees and he knows about general bits of information, however due to his isolation he cannot separate reality from fiction and therefore will not know which things are real and which are not. A dragon for example is as real or fake as a dog in his mind. \nThe themes throughout the film and the emotion that these themes bring are all portrayed through the actors; who all did a fine job, but the performance that really stood out was child actor Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Children are often not the best actors, they're still young; still learning, but this kid is ahead of his time, ahead of his age really. For such a thematically complex film as well as a mature and grim one, Tremblay did an amazing job making me believe in his character, as well as his collaboration with Brie Larson as mother and son, their relationship is strong and convincing. This would also be thanks to upcoming director Lenny Abrahamson whom I've never seen any works by, however this seems to be an early work of a promising career. (He also directed \"Frank,\" and \"What Richard Did.\"\nThe film gave me chills when it needed to in moments of pure intensity the beautiful moments were made that much nicer in comparison to the dreary and depressing ones. It even gave me a new perspective on the world and the way we might look at it. What if we are all experiencing some version of Jack and Ma's 'room?' But, this is just a movie review, I don't want to get too philosophical. \n\n\"Room\" is saddening yet uplifting. It may be hard to watch for some yet I'd think also hard to stop watching, and overall the film has the ability to change ones' perspective. \"Room\" is shocking, yet beautiful and most of all unforgettable.  This is Drama at its' best.             10/10",

            "content": "I remember seeing a trailer for \"Room\" months back in 2015 and being almost entirely mystified; it looked like a strange, almost ethereal mix of drama and science-fiction that even the trailer couldn't adequately communicate. Not until seeing it, I realized that this is a film that isn't easy to summarize in a brief two minute trailer, and I'll undoubtedly struggle to illustrate the film's genius with its review. This is the kind of film one needs to experience and feel; a film where words often feel either exaggerating or shortchanging in attempting to illustrate the film's emotional power and exceptional narrative.\n\nSimply put, \"Room\" is the emotional moviegoing experience of the season. A deeply moving film that combines the aforementioned genres of drama and science-fiction, \"Room\" is the kind of film that hits you with its most powerful shot after you walk out of the theater or turn off the TV. It lingers in your mind and the characters, their motivations, their conversations, their struggles, and their thoughts don't escape you, unlike most dramas, where character names are probably not even remembered by most following the end credits.\n\nThe film opens with a young mother named Joy (Brie Larson) and her small child named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who live their life in an enclosed garden shed of about one-hundred square feet and their only available sunlight is a skylight. They eat, sleep, bathe, and cook in there, and for Jack, it's the only life he has come to know. At first, their routine actions and close relationship lead one to believe that they've chosen this life in order to free themselves from the constraints of society. However, we see the horror of their reality soon enough. \n\nSeven years ago, Joy was tricked and kidnapped by a man known as \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers), who raped her and had her give birth to Jack. Since then, she has lived inside this closed space; it isn't until their escape-plan is successful that Joy goes back to her mother and father and Jack finally experiences the outside world. Previously, Jack believed, largely in part of his mother, who tried to make their life seem a lot less hellish, that outside of the four walls of \"room,\" as they referred to it, was outer space. The people on TV were just flat, and nothing else besides them and Old Nick existed. \n\nUpon finally escaping and trying to return to a life that seems brand new to them, Joy struggles to get Jack to assimilate to the world. His entire life was predicated upon just him and his \"Ma,\" as he was largely kept hidden in the closet whenever Old Nick would come pay them a visit. Now, he must be socialized into the world at age five, and learn that there is not only a larger life, but a larger world outside of \"room.\" His mother, on the other hand, must grapple with her demons that have haunted her since she was captured.\n\nIf you look at \"Room\" from the perspective of Joy, you find a drama about being re-socialized into the world after living your entire life in captivity. It's a familiar story, but one that is truly sad and potent, and Brie Larson brings such life and emotion to the role for a woman so young (her precocious acting reminds me quite a bit of Jennifer Lawrence). However, if you look at the film through Jack's perspective, you see a film that plays with the realm of science-fiction. While nothing about \"Room\" deals with supernatural or \"the unknown\" in a grandiose sense, we do have a character who has never experienced life first-hand and sees everything around him not only as foreign but, for lack of a better term, alien. \n\nThis results in a film that's very lucid and ethereal, largely in part because of Lenny Abrahamson's (who directed 2014's \"Frank,\" a strong film dealing with mental illness) unique direction and cinematographer Danny Cohen's dreamlike grasp on reality. These beautiful and immersive aesthetic choices make the world and everything we take for granted and overlook on a daily basis look as if it's an unearthly object, with extreme close-ups and high-contrast depictions employed by Abrahamson. \n\n\"Room\" is a film largely bent on repetition; everything from Joy and Jack's daily actions in \"room,\" Jack's attempts to socialize with other adults, Joy's attempt to come to terms with returning to her old life, and more are all showcased as recurring events in the film. This slowburn narrative tactic allows character motivations and interest to rise and boil accordingly, creating a film that turns impacting and even emotional when bigger, more elaborate events occur (the truck scene may be one of the best sequences I've seen in film last year). With all that and more considered, \"Room\" is a wonderful treat of a film; one that will hit everyone differently in a sense that it's not a matter of if it will resonate with you but how it will eventually manage to do so.",

Both this film and The Revenant are about resilience and the power of the human spirit to overcome, but the way that theme is portrayed here is a polar opposite of how it is dealt with in The Revenant.  Brie Larson gives a performance that encompasses the intensity of her character's trauma, but does so with admirable subtlety rather than scenery chewing grand moments and demonstrates remarkable dignity and a sad sort of maturity that seems to be ingrained in the character due to the terrible events she lived with for seven years.  The character and Larsen's performance reminded me very much of the kind of work we have seen from Mary Louise Parker.  Jacob Trembley is brilliant as her five year old son.  I do not know if the child was just that amazing an actor or if it involved excellent directorial and editing skills, but his performance is flawless.  He carries the same sense of quiet about him that Larson does as his Mother, which demonstrates a detailed consistency that is spot on considering he only knew her and one place for the first five years of his life.  The score is also perfectly subtle and reflects the feeling of the film brilliantly.  The supporting cast of Joan Allen, William H. Macy, and Tom McCamus were also strong and their performances are consistent with the subdued intensity that characterizes the entire movie.  This across the board consistency in all aspects of the film, from the colors, to the music, to the performances is what makes this such a standout work of movie making.  It would have been easy to fall into soapy territory, but it never goes there.  It is just pure storytelling with a director who very clearly had a vision of how he wanted this story told and carried out his vision down to even the smallest details.  Excellent work.",

It's dramatic, emotional, suspenseful and a phenomenal film.  The story is intense and heartbreaking (times 4 or 5).  The acting performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscar recognition.  While I haven't seen all the performances nominated thus far, young Jacob Tremblay is jaw-dropping.  I was excited to see Brie Larson, one of my favorites, finally show her stuff, and that she did.  I hope she gets the win.  However, Jacob blew me away.  There were no words to describe how incredible his performance is for someone so young.  Better than any adult actor I've seen this year.  I'm serious.  There is an incredible career in the making there.  The screenplay, based on the novel of the same name, is beautiful.  Aside from one scene that bugged me a little, the dialogue is so real.  The director did a masterful job pulling the screenplay, performances and the perspective of \"Room\" against the much larger world Brie and Jacob are denied for so long.  I'm so glad at least 3 of the 8 Best Pic nominees are worthy.",

She's paired wonderfully with Jacob Tremblay as her son, who convey's a wonderful mix of terror & wonder as a young boy experiencing the world for the first time.  Honestly, you want to talk about an Oscar snub, Tremblay should be on that list.  Behind the camera, Abrahamson does a superb job putting you into Joy & Jack's world, both inside the room and then later when they escape, especially by focusing on the perspective of Jack (simple things like the sky & trees never looked so strange & wondrous).  The filmmakers also don't shy away from hard questions, including decisions Joy makes, which may seem cruel but do make some points.  Overall, a truly inspiring film of survival and one of the best of the 2015.",

ROOM is a profound exploration of the challenges of parenting, the relationship between mother and child, social expectations that undermine parents, the formation and modification of world view, acceptance, freedom - so much to think about.

The conditions of her capture was her being in a shed with a door that has an electronic lock on it. When he enters and exits she is suppose to stay on the far wall with her back turned so she won't see the code or try to escape.Â  After he goes through the door with the code on it he just pushes the outer door open. After a few days you should have devised a very good plan to escape. You should have seen that there was only one door that had an electronic lock while the other you can just simply push open. The way he entered and treated her was very odd. He would provide her with food and necessities. The \"room\" had a bathtub, toilet, sink, bed, table, toaster oven, shelves, a closet, a skylight and a tv with cable. He would then come in and lay in the bed with her until morning and repeat this same thing over and over for years. What??? Her idea of escaping was to have her son who just turned 5 play dead while wrapped up in a rug so the kidnapper can take the boy (Jack) out the \"room\" and bury him. Once Jack feels the truck stop 3 times he is suppose to jump out and run to someone. How the heck are you going to tell your 5yr. old son who has never been out in the world to do this ridiculous plan? He actually successfully does this and a guy calls the cops while the kidnapper drives off. Jack says to the cops that the truck made three stops from where they came and tells them he and his mom was in a shed. The cops find the shed and now the mom (Joy) and Jack are reunited and on the way to the hospital to start the new drama between her and her family. How the heck is that the best plan you can come up with? After 7 years where 2 of them you were by yourself, that was the best you could do? What were you doing with all that time? You have wonder why you didn't have the captor take the kid to the hospital after he was born. Did you have the kid in the shed? Wait a minute, something isn't adding up. Why would the capture keep you and the kid and willingly supply you with food, power and cable? He even does this after admitting he had been laid off for several months. This story is so off and seemingly pointless. You stay watching, hoping more details will emerge about Joy and why her mom and especially her dad are distant from her while they stay in her old house but you get nothing. The movie really does hold your attention but it's just a very odd and overrrated movie with a concept that is very implausible. The hype and surprisingly good reviews this movie gets are just unnecessary and unworthy. Sure the performances from Brie Laurson and the kid are great but the story is garbage. Its great to see Jack becoming acclimated to the world around him and the progression of the family but it's such a worthless journey without the understanding of why and how this happened. And that's how it ends. They visit the \"room\" one more time with the police to let it go from their lives but never find the captor. This was a worthless production that did not need to be done.

Brie Larson gives one of the best performances I have seen in quite a long time.  She is a revelation.  Her dark, truthful, scared and emotional performance is something truly fascinating.  She puts her soul into this character, and it pays off in spades.  A few months ago I honestly didn't know much of her, but now I see her as one of the most promising new actresses in the business.  Jacob Tremblay further proves my belief that child actors can truly make our jaws drop.  Tremblay deserves all the praise in the world for his heartwarming and complex performance, completely capturing the mindset of a young boy being introduced to the world for the first time.  Its something truly spectacular, and I kept going back and forth trying to decide if he or Larson stole the show.  They both really worked perfectly together.  Joan Allen is another underrated performance, as she gives a sweet and loving performance as the grandmother.  Her giving a brilliant performance as a mother who lost her daughter and attempts to have a relationship with her grandson is heartwarming.  The script from Emma Donoghue is something truly spectacular.  She gives us a terrifying real look into the minds of these characters and bringing life to their situation.  There was a moment halfway through the film that had me in tears and cheering.  Its amazing that a fictional  story could feel so much like a true story.  Director Lenny Abrahamson",

It brings laughter to hear what they believe certain things represent and what those objects actually do. The adults would then correct the child and explain what it really is and what's really out there. Normally, adults don't have to do this twice - in two different worlds.\n\nIn \"Room,\" well, it is a different world. Young Jack (Jacob Tremblay) is locked up in a shed, known as \"Room,\" with his mother, or Ma (Brie Larson). They survive with the necessities, basic food, plumbing, a bed, but have no contact with the outside world. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), who is responsible for locking them away, brings supplies through a password-protected door. The only natural light comes through a skylight atop the shed.\n\nJack believes everything on TV is magic and doesn't truly exist. He believes there is only Room, like it's on its very own planet. Voice-overs are provided by Jack explaining what's going on inside his head, and what everything means to him. He has a fear of ever going outside, but must if he and Ma plan on escaping to a better life. Jack is almost born twice, and experiences the world twice - once in his own and then the real one. A bond between a mother and her child can never be broken.\n\nBoth Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay shine so brightly in \"Room.\" Larson is emotional, understanding and at the same time expresses the exhaustion of raising a child, especially one who has never had exposure to the real world. She's genuinely authentic and outstanding. It's going to be a real competition for Best Actress between her and Saoirse Ronan.\n\nTremblay shows his bright future as an exceptionally talented young actor. You will fall in love with this boy and truly feel for him and what he undergoes during the film. His voice-overs are hilarious, but saddening at the same time. The writing was superb for his character. There are no flaws with the rest of the cast, as well.\n\n\"Room\" does such a fabulous job with letting us see a child grow up in this unfortunate, but unique circumstance. We have no idea how we would coup with such an experience and the psychology behind it. Being in that situation would be ever so frustrating, but Larson handles and deals with it the only way it could be dealt with. It's another beautiful film from A24.\n\nCheck out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!",

Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a bright five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up every morning saying hello to his universe. He does not greet the sun, the grass, the trees outside, where he could run and laugh and play like a normal five-year old but only to the objects he knows for five years as being \"the real world\", his world: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds, thinking that the mouse also lives in that little world, the only one real for him. Sometimes a man comes over, during the night, and then Jack must sleep in the wardrobe, not to be seen. The relationship mother-son appears to be normal: they cook, dance, laugh, stretch out, read about Alice, mother tells the tale of Monte Cristo. The poverty that surrounds them is not painful. The real pain and anger I felt when Jack could not believe that outside \"the room\" exists a real world, with real people, and trees, grass, leaves, seasons, snow. Then the reality strikes: captivity. A child born in captivity, because of a madman, a rapist. A story of a child whose life started in a cage having as a talisman his mother love and her tooth, thinking that \"his strong\" is in his long hair. Real world proves to be scarier than \"the room\". A movie that should be seen, a story that must be known, a boy that deserves all the awards: Jacob Tremblay.",

            "content": "\"Room\" is one of the most vivid movies that you will ever see.  The concept is fascinating: A woman is inexplicably trapped in a room with her five-year-old son.  That's all.  As the story unfolds, we learn details of how long they have been there and where their food comes from; however, the mystery continues to be preserved as we are left to fill in the rest with our imaginations.  There are so many things that I would love to say but I want everybody to be just as surprised and on the edge of your seat as I was.  In fact, this film contains ten of the most intense minutes that you will ever see in any movie.  I swear, there came a point where I had to remind myself to breath.  The story is an endless series of emotional highs and lows that create a deep connection between the characters and the audience.  These emotional moments are enhance by a powerful musical score by Stephen Rennicks.  Its absence reinforces the hopelessness and isolation of being trapped in the room, but then the score soars when it needs to enhance the joyous and devastating moments.  I find that the most poetic piece of the film stems from one of the darkest psychological implications:  The mental well-being of this young boy is completely dependent upon his mother but, when everything turns, he suddenly needs to become her strength in a time of need.  Again, I'm doing my best to avoid any spoilers so you will just have to see it for yourself.  The acting is astounding.  Brie Larson will take home an Oscar for the endless number of emotions that she vividly portrays throughout the film.  Her character is simply known as \"Ma,\" a constant reminder that she has been stripped of her identity and her entire world is her son.  She doesn't need a cape to turn her character into a hero.  Jacob Tremblay was equally amazing.  It is rare that I believe that a child performance deserved an Oscar nomination but his acting is highly refined and brings out a lot of our emotions.  He holds his own against Larson's Oscar-nominated performance and isn't merely along for the ride.  The realism of this story is further enhanced by its supporting cast.  Joan Allen has been out of vogue for awhile but she delivers her best performance in years.  It took a lot to steal the spotlight from Larson and Tremblay, but she definitely had her moment.  Also, the very presence of William H. Macy adds a brief but necessary complication to this story.  There comes a point where you start dreading that the ending will spoil the entire story.  Dreading that, no matter what the ending, it won't live up to the rest of the film.  But Emma Donoghue creates the perfect conclusion that allows this story to come full circle.  One of the best pieces of advice that I can give is that you should NOT watch the trailer!  Just take my word for it and blindly walk into this film.  \"Room\" will keep you intrigued, emotional, and on the edge of your seat from start until finish.  More importantly, you will walk away from the film a changed person.",

If you're looking for a tense, emotionally satisfying, character driven film, this is the one for you.  \n\nI wasn't familiar with Brie Larson before I saw this, but she's a frigging brilliant actress.  I wouldn't be surprised if she becomes the \"next big thing\" in the near future, because the power of this movie is almost totally dependent on her and her performance.  It reminded me a little of 'Joy' actually (And it's just a weird coincidence that her character's name in 'Room' is Joy too) because the story is essentially about a mother who has to overcome seemingly impossible odds in order to save her own life.  This is obviously a much darker story than 'Joy', but I was struck my the similarity in theme.  Moving onto the kid, Jacob Tremblay, he's excellent too.  Now, good child actors are a rarity to say the very least, but this one has the right chops.  We see the world and events of the narrative through his eyes, and not once did his performance grate on me or make me wince, like most child actors do with such a huge role.  He was pivotal to the success of the movie and it really works.\n\nI had a concern before seeing this that the entire film would be set in the one room that the characters are being kept prisoner in.  Not that I didn't think the film could work if it was, but just because I feel the material would get a little overdrawn if that was the case.  I'm happy to say though that the protagonists escape the dungeon halfway through the movie.  I don't feel this is a spoiler because this was hinted at in the trailer.  But the reason why this is such a positive aspect for me is because I'm interested in similar real life cases and how captives manage to reintegrate into the world after being out of it for so long.  This film deals with that very well and it satisfied me.  \n\nThere were a few things that disappointed me, but I don't think they're detrimental to the film or particularly harm it in any way.  Brie Larson's father had a small role and I wish they'd expanded on some of the issues he was having with the whole ordeal, but they just wrote him out rather suddenly.  I also would have liked more closer with the antagonist, the man who captured Brie Larson in the first place.  \n\nOther than that, I don't have a negative thing to say about this.  It's the sort of film that will stay with you.",

I won't spoil the 2nd Act but things become less stressful and take a turn, and the world isn't what everyone thought. Thrilling in certain moments, but this movie brought you far into its horrifying woods and gave me a breather to think.

Utilising a sparring yet\neffective voice over from the young boy that tells us all we need to\nknow about how he sees the life he lives and constructing impressive\nvisuals even in the films tight surrounds, this is Abrahamson's real\ncalling card after two commendable early efforts and the cast also join\nAbrahamson in an reaching another level of success.\n\nShe may have just recently won a surprise Golden Globe for her\ncommitted and believe able turn as a loving mother but Brie Larson has\nbeen carving out a noteworthy collection of films over the last few\nyears so the true breakout of Room is young Tremblay.\n\nTremblay delivers a deep and beyond his young years turn as Jack and\nit's thanks to this child actors success that Room becomes the film\nthat's been resonating with audiences the world over. While Larson will\nbe billed as the star here it is Tremblay that carries the film through\nits sometimes murky middle half and whenever he and Larson share the\nscreen, Room is an often faultless exercise in dramatic filmmaking.\nIt's a stunning turn and one that will likely seeing the young\nperformer be an in demand presence in the years to come.\n\nWhile it arguably loses some head of steam after a breathtaking opening\nhalf in its exploration of the opportunities that lay outside the\nprison walls, Room is a unique and emotionally strong tale of the bond\nmothers and sons share and in a strange yet touching manner, a tale of\nwhat it means to be alive in this great big beautiful world we call\nhome.\n\n4 remote control cars out of 5\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

Room is about a young lady referred to as Ma (Brie Larson) who lives in a shed with her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Ma was kidnapped when she was 17 by Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) and has been kept captive in the Room. Old Nick comes by to have his way with her and leaves her supplies. This has been going on for seven years and Ma has had enough. Ma weaves a story to Jack that there's only the Room and everything else is fake. It sort of places her in a position to think that this is life and to save her son from the horrific events happening to them. I don't want to spoil anymore, but the acting here is top notch. Brie Larson shines as Ma and the breakout star here is young Jacob Tremblay. Both really get you to care early on about them and some moments truly do get tense. Its a great film about the relationship between a mother and her child and the lengths that said mother will go to to protect her own. Only small gripe is that later in the film and by the ending there are still a few questions that never get answered! I can't recommend this one enough regardless!",

There's a couple of unbelievable asshole characters - the lady interviewer and that at asshole driving the police car who needed to stfu. Didn't believe the lady po po either, really. Too good at problem solving. Would've liked to have seen Jack be forced to learn how to communicate over a period of time. Just happens too easily.

Though Brie Larsons performance was brilliant Jacob Tremblays performance as Jack was phenomenal and the fact that he's only 9 years old makes it even more impressing if you ask me. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay both have bright futures ahead of them and I look forward too seeing more films starring them in the future. Besides them the entire cast such as Joan Allen, Tom McCamus, William H Macy (though he has limited screen time) and etc does a great job with the roles they play in. This is by far the best film of 2016 and in my opinion Room should have won best picture this year at the oscars instead of Spotlight.",

The eponymous room is both their prison and Jack's entire world. There is only heaven, which he sees through the skylight, the space within Room and the fictional world of TV. Their escape unveils the true wonders of the everyday world to Jack, as well as a difficult adjustment back to normality for Joy.\n\nThe two central performances are fantastic. Raw, heartfelt and utterly engaging, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay emote the pain, grief and frustrations of their journey to profound levels. They're two of the finest performances of the last twelve months, so don't be surprised if both walk away with Oscars. That's right, Tremblay is that good!\n\nLenny Abrahamson treatment of Donoghue's script allows for a poignant slow-burner that never contrives to exploit. We're given a beautiful balance of pain and hope, anger and joy. A bleak tale of survival and discovery has never had so much warmth. \n\nAn intimate and thoroughly rewarding film that will stay with you for a very long time.

A sort of fantasy story telling approach helps Ma keep Jack innocent despite everything going on around them until his fifth birthday when it comes time that she feels he can handle an escape attempt to help both of them come from underfoot and reunite with the outside world. Brie Larson and Jacob Trimbley are really note perfect in their roles as Ma and Jack, you really believe their connection and despair, and Jacob was really gradually discovering the outside world with his grandparents and gradually adjusting to everything around him almost like a newborn even though he is a 5 year old. A very deserving if unusual choice for the 2015 TIFF Audience Choice Award and I will be intrigued to see what hardware it picks up at the Oscars this year. Has a slight Beasts of the Sourthern Wild pull to it which was cool. And also best cameo of a Etobicoke landmark in the film with Apache Burger. A solid and surprising gem. .",

Both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay present somewhat compelling depictions of a woman and child who are held for a long amount of time against their will.  However, as their predicaments change, the movie begins to hit the cliché 'notes' of a film that wants to play with your emotions, but without any insight on the suffering of its characters.  It's as if this film's downfall comes from the fact that it was written by the writer of the novel upon which it's based, Emma Donoghue; this film tries to fit so much drama into its second half, yet it still drags as it provides a shallow impression of the psyches of the characters in this tragic situation.  The film's flaccid ending seems like a halfhearted attempt at some sort resolution and relies on the viewer to imagine the changed-state of the principal characters--as it's not shown in any detail.  \n  I'm sorry to say that this movie was ultimately unoriginal (at moments it felt like Peter Jackson's similarly-themed \"Lovely Bones\"), poorly written (laughable moments in the script \"Needle in a haystack\" etc.), and boring (zzzzzzzzz).  I feel as if this film would benefit immensely if it was shot/told in a similar fashion to that of the novel upon which it's based: from the viewpoint of the imprisoned child.  This is attempted in form of narration spread at different points throughout the film, but the somewhat precocious reflections are brief and, at times, inaudible.  While I have not read the novel, I would imagine that telling/shooting the film in a similar manner would add some much needed originality and insight.  \n  I would have given this film 1.5 stars because of its compelling opening situation, but, much like the agonizingly cliché sex-offender glasses of the character who imprisons Larson and Tremblay,  its derivative nature is really quite ghastly.",

As Jack views the world for the first time and gains an understanding of what exists around him, it's beautiful and heartbreaking and succeeds in delivering the emotion Abrahamson so desperately wants to communicate, but it's underlined and reworked and restated so many times that the film begins to lose what initially made it so effective.

That being said theirs still something  there that stopped me from fully caring about the Ma character, don't get me wrong there are some moments but not to the full extent were it hit me and I thought  really care for her, but seeing the story from Jack's view kind of makes that a lesser problem.

            "content": "¿La mejor película del año? Debatible. ¿La más hermosa? Sin duda.\n\nRoom cuenta la historia de Jack (Tremblay), un chico de cinco años que vive con su madre (Larson) en una pequeña habitación. Dentro de la habitación, la madre ha creado un verdadero mundo para Jack, siendo que ninguno de los dos tiene permitido salir de ella, para que el pequeño pueda vivir una vida alegre e imaginativa. Cuando ambos idean un plan para escapar, Jack y su madre se ven enfrentados a algo que no veían desde hacía mucho tiempo: el mundo real.\n\nMi canal se llama Blockbuster Movie Blog. Esto es porque a mí me gusta el cine ya que representa las cosas que no es posible ver en la realidad. Como he dicho miles de veces, el cine es el lugar donde los sueños son posible. Por esto, yo prefiero mil veces ver una película de gran presupuesto sobre un superhéroe que una película independiente sobre, digamos, un drama familiar. Los dramas familiares los ves todos los días en la vida diaria, un superhéroe no.\nEso no significa que no disfrute ver películas como La Habitación, una película sobre un evento que puedes encontrar al ver las noticias en tu rutina diaria, y que contiene una historia tan increíble que tomará tu corazón, lo partirá en miles de pedacitos y luego te lo devolverá parchado.\n\nEste film inicia mostrándonos a un enternecedor Jacob Tremblay, quien interpreta a Jack. Con cinco años recién cumplidos, Jack se despierta y saluda al lavamanos, a la televisión, a la claraboya y a varios objetos inanimados que hay en la habitación. Cuando el pequeño despierta a su madre y ella le dice que harán una pastel de cumpleaños, Jack inicialmente no le cree. \"¿Un pastel como los de la televisión?\", pregunta Jack. Y ahí tenemos un vistazo claro de lo que va la película. Y es que el pequeño nunca ha estado fuera de esa habitación. Y somo suficientemente inteligentes para darnos cuenta que mientras Jack vive en su mundo rodeado de cuatro paredes, la mirada de su madre muestra en sus ojos la verdad: están encerrados ahí contra su voluntad. Son víctimas del viejo Nick (Bridgers).\n\nY la fuerza de la película, el poder emocional, se encuentra en esta primera mitad del film. Vemos que Ma, como le dice Jack a su madre, interpretada de forma excepcional por Brie Larson, ha creado un mundo entero para Jack en esa pequeña habitación. Room, como le dicen en inglés, es el mundo. Y todo lo que está más allá de esas paredes, es el espacio.\n\nY mientras que Tremblay hace un trabajo brillante al corporizar la inocencia, Larson hace lo propio al hacer presente la desesperación, la depresión, el sentimiento más horrendo que puede sentir una persona cuando lo menos terrible que pasa en su vida es estar privada de su libertad.\nPorque, por si estar secuestrada fuera poco, el captor, el viejo Nick, aparece algunos días para demostrar su superioridad, y obviamente, para violarla.\n¿Oscar para Larson? Probablemente. Digo, hablemos de una actuación poderosa y éso es lo que nos entrega la norteamericana. No sólo con sus expresiones, o con sus palabras; si no que, similar a lo que pasa con Cate Blanchett en Carol, con sus ojos. Es increíble la forma en que la mirada de Larson provee el sentido de depresión y desesperación con la emoción necesaria para hacerte sentirla al igual que ella.\n\nLo bueno, creo, es que el film no se queda dentro de la habitación durante todo el film. Alrededor de la mitad de la película, mediante una secuencia de escenas que son tan emocionantes como aterradoras como adrenalínicas, Ma y Jack logran escapar. Lamentablemente, la vida no se vuelve más fácil inmediatamente al encontrarse con el mundo real.\nY aquí sí que se luce Tremblay, si es que no lo había hecho ya, con su intepretación de Jack frente a un mundo que ve por primera vez. Abrahamson hace un trabajo perfecto al mostrarnos la forma en que este mundo normal al que estamos acostumbrados golpea a Jack la primera vez. Tenemos que recordar que cuando Ma le dice a Jack que existen otras personas, que los árboles existen, que hay autos, perros; él no le cree y le grita mentirosa. Por esto, se puede ver en la expresión de Tremblay el miedo, el profundo miedo hacia este mundo desconocido llamado Tierra.\n\nAcompañada por un deleitosa y atormentada composición musical provista por Stephen Rennicks, la historia avanza a caminos más rocosos. Y la presencia de la increíblemente talentosa Joan Allen como la abuela y del correctamente alabado William H. Macy como el abuelo simplemente mejoran una ya excelente película. Ambos se entregan totalmente a sus roles en polos opuestos con respecto a su hija y nieto.\n\nEl film lidia con realismo y complejidad lo que significa el después de una serie de eventos tan traumatizantes como el secuestro, todo gracias a la brillante fluidez narrativa de la guionista Emma Donoghue, también autora de la novela en que está inspirada la película.\nY es que este es uno de los casos en que la película le añade algo más de sabor a la historia, gracias a elementos como la actuación o la música. Es increíble todo lo que puede sacar Abrahamson de un guión tan simple. Puedes lidiar aquí con la discriminación, la aceptación, la familia, la confianza, muchísimas cosas. Y todo se resume a la historia, y la forma en que está contada.\n\nEl hecho es que éste es un film que me tuvo con un nudo en la garganta varias veces. Es un film horrible, desgarrador y, sí, absolutamente hermoso.",

And, wow, was it worth it. ROOM is, pun intended, captivating! #BrieLarson (seen earlier this year as #AmySchumerâ??s sister in #Trainwreck) stars as a mother being held (against her will) in a shed. As the film opens, we see Larsonâ??s #Ma â??playing houseâ?? with her 5 year old son, Jack (played by breakout star #JacobTremblay). We later come to learn that Ma has been held there for 7 years and that this room, the shed, is the only world Jack has ever known.\n \nRecent events lead Ma to make a dramatic attempt to escape (Iâ??ll let you see for yourself what those events are). Eventually, Ma and Jack are rescued, which sets up the last act of the film: Ma and Jackâ??s reacclamation (or acclamation in Jackâ??s case) to the â??outside world.â?? To shield Jack from their confined surroundings of the room, Ma had recreated a very imaginative world for Jack. Although being held captive by another person, Ma was the only person Jack knew.\n \nThe post-escape is almost as thrilling as the presentation of life in the room. It was interesting to see how Ma and Jack are, ironically, held captive by their newfound freedom. The film is indeed great and a must-see. The only gripe is that there was a few plot elements that were left unresolved (or forgotten) all-together. Some plots went in a different direction than I expected (thatâ??s a good thing). But others were left hanging, but were initially presented with an air of importance.\n \n#JoanAllen and #WilliamHMacy costar as Maâ??s parents. Their lives were turned upside down when Ma went missing. Now, they must piece things together while trying to comfort Ma and Jack, a grandchild they never knew they have.\n \nLarson and Tremblayâ??s performances are rock solid. Larson will give #CateBlanchett (from #Carol) a run for her money come #Oscar night. ROOM is playing in limited release, but worth the effort to find it.\n \nMy score: #9outof10",

The story follows a mother, Joy, and her son, Jack, who have been living in one small room for the past 5 years. The reason is unknown until about half hour into the movie, so I won't spoil it. Anyways, at one point they get out and Jack hasn't been out of that room, ever. So, this is his first time seeing the outside world and it's really beautiful seeing that, I have to admit. How he is ignorant of everything and discovering everything for the first time. Joy has to deal with a lot of media and her parents and it's all very over-the-top dramatic. That's about the only problem I had with this movie. The overly dramatic plot revolving around Joy. It's interesting at first, but it just keeps going and going and it gets to the point where you're just tired of her character, albeit her actress is amazing. And so is everyone, really. There weren't any bad actors, not even the kid! The direction is great and the first 40 minutes of the movie which are entirely set in the small room look outstanding! I was always fascinated by the movies that are set in small spaces and how the directors manage to make them look bigger and more interesting. The soundtrack is great. All in all, Room is a movie deffinetely worth seeing as it is very emotional, the story is intriguing and the acting is brilliant. Not my best movie of the year, but near the top!",

This film shows the power that a simple story can bring to the viewer and is one that is told in such a heartbreaking and thought-provoking manner. Watching this film, I completely forgot at times that I was even watching a movie and I was completely captivated and effected by all the situations going on. The performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are truly incredible here and together have portrayed one of the best mother-son relationships I have ever seen in a long time in a movie. With Short Term 12 and this under Brie Larson's belt, I am going to look forward to everything she does in the future and I hope she gets a Oscar nomination for this performance because it was memorable and one of the best performances I have seen from an actress in 2015. Brie Larson did a fantastic job portraying a mother who cares deeply for her son and will do anything for him and when she started having mental problems toward the final hour of the film, I felt completely sad for her and her son. Jacob Tremblay as the son was fantastic as well and he gave one of the best performances I have seen from a child in a long time and I hope that he will be in many more great movies in the future. Being a kid raised in an enclosed environment, I completely understood him whenever he would feel a certain way towards life or towards his own mother and there were a lot of heartbreaking and touching moments with them together. The dialogue in the film was fantastic as well. The conversations that Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay had were completely engrossing and her telling him about the outside world was all the more memorable to watch and listen to. There were many times during the first half of the film where I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see how they would gain their freedom and I was left breathless when those scenes ended. Joan Allen as the grandma of Jacob Tremblay's Jack was really likable and she showed a great amount of emotion in the second half of the film and gave a better than average supporting performance. While William H. Macy was a great presence as the grandpa, I could have had more scenes with him dealing with these heartbreaking situations, but because everything else was so good, his limited amount of screen time only felt like a minor problem and didn't detract from the film.  Being from a small time director, Lenny Abrahamson shows here that he can get nothing but the best out of these actors and the simple premise, and I look forward to what he does next after this. In the end, I really had no major issues with this film and this was a movie that I was completely floored by and one that I can't wait to see again when it comes out on Blu-ray.",

The style choice can appeal to both the indie film buff and also the casual big blockbuster moviegoer. It does a great job of using every scene to advance the story forward and the screenplay is written in a way that is believable. In addition the dynamic of the way the mother and son interact is not over the top. Nor does it appear forced. \n\nIn the first act, I was impressed with the mise-en-scene and the shallow space composition done entirely within a 10 foot by 10 foot room. In the second and third acts, the movie appears to go in particular direction, but then it surprises viewers. However, it is done in a way that is not unrealistic or cliche. \n\nThis movie is easily a top five film of 2015. If someone says it is not, then they simply never saw the film or do not appreciate a drama that does not need fancy CGI in place of breathtaking shots, top notch cinematography, and flawless acting to go along with a well-written narrative.

The viewer has no idea why they are living in this space but as clues are revealed as the movie progresses.\n\nThis movie is excellent and a must see - I can't say enough about it.  The style choice can appeal to both the indie film buff and also the casual big blockbuster moviegoer. It does a great job of using every scene to advance the story forward and the screenplay is written in a way that is believable.  In addition the dynamic of the way the mother and son interact is not over the top. Nor does it appear forced. \n\nIn the first act, I was impressed with the mise-en-scene and the shallow space composition done entirely within a 10 foot by 10 foot room. In the second and third acts, the movie appears to go in particular direction, but then it surprises viewers.  However, it is done in a way that is not unrealistic or cliche. \n\nThis movie is easily a top five film of 2015. If someone says it is not, then they simply never saw the film or do not appreciate a drama that does not need fancy CGI in place of breathtaking shots, top notch cinematography, and flawless acting to go along with a well-written narrative.  This film easily gets a 10 out of 10 rating.",

The film is split into two distinctive parts, Act 1 taking place primarily in Room, the shed, and focuses on a bit of the day-to-day life of its inhabitants, mother and son Joy and Jack. Captured when she was 17, Joy has been locked in Room for seven years and had her captor's, Old Nick as he is called, son. Jack is now a rambunctious, excited five-year-old who has only known Room for his entire life. Joy has made it her mission to protect her son and keep him innocent to the horror of their reality for most of his young life, but now must make him understand in order to get him on her side to escape. Their escape is a success, but leads into the next part: adjusting to life outside. Jack follows his mother through their journey to become part of the free world. Brie Larson embodies every instinct and insecurity of Joy in her performance, conveying a young mother's fears and connection with her child as well as a young woman's fears of having to be responsible for everything in her small uncontrolled world. Larson is complimented by her costar, Jacob Tremblay, a remarkably talented young actor who truly owns the screen.",

The young child actor plays the heroine's son (Jack) well because he manages to exude innocence and resilience without appearing precocious.  I like that.  Joan Allen, William H. Macy, and Tom McCamus are great as Jack's grandmother, grandfather and step-grandfather respectively.  \n\nThis is a great follow-up to Lenny Abrahamson's 2014 film Frank.",

And that works wonder. It places us right in the middle of the claustrophobia of the two main characters, Joy and her son Jack. The first third of the film made me almost as uncomfortable as I was during the whole masterpiece film, \"The Act of Killing.\" \n\nThere are so many times when this film could have gone awry, sappy and melodramatic. In fact, the sappiest thing about the film was the music, being far too uplifting and loud for the themes in the movie. \n\nThe framing of each shot in the first-third of the movie augments the feeling of being trapped. The shots are as beautiful as they are terrifying. \n\nThe acting of the two main characters is spot on, especially the five-year-old boy Jake, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson plays the complicated role of Joy, the mother, who goes through untold agony. We aren't told what happens in detail; we see it on her face, in her body.\n\nThere were so many times this film could have gone for cheap sentimentality; they could have gone for the easy reconciliation and happy ending, and it didn't. Put one in the win column for small, well writing, well directed and well acted cinema that doesn't involve stunts or explosions. \n\nRating: Pay Full Price\n\n\"Room\" is excellent. While it didn't play for cheap emotion and the issues it addresses are horrifying, it could have used more detail regarding the aftermath of events for the mother. The son's issues were dealt with well if not completely. The framing of the shots? Fantastic! The music? Terrible. \n\nBrie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscars nominations. ??\n\nPeace,?\nTex Shelters",

The intermittent voiceover throughout is the little boy, trying to describe the world through his own eyes. I will only share this: It is the story of a young woman who was kidnapped off the street at 17 and then locked in a room by a sicko man for 7 years, where she also gave birth to a little boy who turns 5 as the movie opens. The title is where they lived \"Room\" which was his only world until they escaped and a world that he often misses as he's trying to figure out what is real and not real and where his comfort lies. The performances are grade A. I give it a 4.5 as a film but don't recommend it for those of you who are looking for lighter  entertainment.",

What works in the novel can't work here because film is a more objectified experience (and the limited view of the narrator can't really limit the scope of your own experience and the access to information through other channels). I loved the movie, but I have some issues with it, the main issue being that the second half never lives up to the thrills of the first half. Don't get me wrong - I still enjoyed it and the actors did some great work (even though there were some false moments, such as Jack's inability to handle a phone: Really?! That bright and adaptive kid who was so curious about everything and spent so much time observing people couldn't really get the chance to see others speak on the phone in the long weeks he spent in his grandmother's house?!) but the second half had a bit of a dragging problem, as if it they didn't know where to go with that story for a while. But I was immersed in it, mostly due to the unassuming visual flair. And the performances: wow, these performance by Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson were hypnotic! I especially loved the craziness in the room, especially Brie's moments of clarity when she had to convince Jack of going through with her plan. There was something manic about her character and this ambiguity felt real to me. And Jacob Tremblay - I know this is such an extreme pitfall of a role and he makes it look so easy and there are so many layers and details to this experience of a performance. Go watch them.",

            "content": "\"Room\" is an emotive, powerfully acted and modest piece that refrains from cheap sentimentality\n\nExceptional performances as Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and Ma (Brie Larson) are the highlight here. You won't want to look away from them-not that director Lenny Abrahamson lets you. He never tries to distract you from the fact that there's two people on screen the whole time. He embraces it. It's a wise decision.\n\nAbrahamson displays an unnerving knack for extracting emotion. The thinness of the plot is an issue with the source material, and what could have been a hokey feel-good or a crime thriller is instead a tribute to love, life, and human strength that (almosts) steers free of being overly sentimental.\n\nThe performances are delivered in expert hands that know just when to slow down and let them breathe, when to cut, when to jack up the intensity. We get familiar with closeups and extreme closeups, and it works. The minimalist soundtrack is gorgeously composed and holds our attention during the many diaglogue-free sequences. The same stands for set design and locations. They're inobstrusive and they complement the film's true strengths. The emotional complexity that stirs (or roars) in every scene. The flawless acting. The characters and relationships that are built with such care and attention to nuance that the film's few falters are easily forgivable.\n\nA chance for a thriller moment is fumbled in the scene when Jack and Old Nick are approached by the first stranger with his dog. Perhaps Abrahamson felt that a more amped up exchange would have been an easy gimmick, but there was definitely something lost in choosing not to dial up the intensity here. The moment called for it.\n\nRegardless, Abrahamson's intuition for storytelling is obvious and refreshing. I only ask that he trust himself more. The pacing is organic, the shots are thoughtfully structured, and he knows how to work within the confines of the story. The film connects. And it does that without the triter voiceovers from Jack and the spots of heavy-handed sappiness (especially in the haircut scene). The music supports the movie well, and so it reaches too-cheesy levels when the film does. We don't need to be cued so obviously as to what and when we're supposed to feel. If you've done the job well, and Abrahamson has, we'll get there on our own.",

To give away anymore would be giving away too much of the plot.  If you've read the book you've obviously got an idea of what happens however, for those that are not aware of this film I beg you to go in with no preconceptions and for gods sake do not watch the trailer (unless you want the whole thing spoiled).\n\nWhat you get from Room is a very powerful and emotive film with excellent performances from Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay, a relative newcomer whose only previous release was voicing a Smurf).  The supporting cast including Joan Allen and William H. Macy also put in good performances.  However it's the mother and son which deserve the plaudits.  Brie Larson, who up until now appears to have been in mostly supporting roles in films such as 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgrim vs the World, however in Room she really displays her acting capabilities and from this performance she should be a contender for best actress when award season comes around.  \n\nAs you watch Room, the second half of the film feels like there isn't much happening however, this is a film about the experience and emotions of these two characters and how their confides mold their lives and the effects it has on them psychologically.  There are moments when seemingly innocent scenarios dispense a sense of fear, paranoia and tension which are caused as a result of the predicament they find themselves in.  There are also moments elation and unexpected humour.  But it's that sense of paranoia and fear especially with regards to children which is a reflection of today's society and is depicted here so well which makes this film both true and sad in equal measure.  Room can be tough and unpleasant viewing, I saw it as part of Odeon's Screen Unseen and I probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise but I've very glad that I did.",

The bond felt genuine, and I really believed it happened to these two.\n\nThe first part of the movie deals with the captivity and how they interact with each other, how she tries to teach him of a world outside the room.\nPart 2 deals with their escape.  How in the world could you deal mentally with the 7 years that you have suffered?  \nNow free mother and son try their hardest to adjust. He learns of the world, and how to interact with others.

            "content": "Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, this film is a small story driven independent harrowing dramatic thriller. And like many of its kind, the film has to rely on a great screenplay, solid acting, and moving character development for it to get wide recognition. The film delivers on all of these aspects. Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. The title of the film makes the film about the space in our lives and in our selves and our need to escape whatever walls or restrictions that others  or we ourselves  have imposed on us. So our experience really is reflected in this freakish story. The film is about the vast room we have at our disposal not the small room to which we might accept restriction. This couldn't be further from Lenny Abrahamson's last film Frank, a bizarre music-orientated comedy. Gone are the idiosyncrasies that made Frank wild and, for many including myself, compelling, instead we have a moving drama that earns its sentiment. The concept of a mother having raised her son in confinement then finally breaking free has many avenues to explore. Having not read Emma Donoghue's book, of whom also wrote the screenplay, I mostly expected a small scale -getting out of the eponymous room then reuniting and resolving itself there. Instead, the film goes further than I expected, getting Ma  also known as Joy, which is becoming a familiar character's name this year  and Jack back to her teenage home with her own mother. The story follows twenty-something Joy aka Ma (Brie Larson) and five year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay), inside a garden shed. We are, of course, unaware that this is a garden shed, but the size is what's immediately noticeable. Small, dark, and dank, with a single skylight. Jack, the product of Ma's kidnapping despite her insistence of his immaculate conception, is oblivious to the space of the room, or lack thereof, and equally of the world outside it. Most nights, a man called \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers) visits the room to have sex with Ma. But Jack doesn't understand this custom, instead letting his imagination dream up a world of wonderment, all existing neatly in the boundaries of the room  where a mouse joyfully nibbles on some scraps and where his imaginary dog Lucky can frolic. In Jack's mind, the only reality is inside the room, and everything on the other side of the wall is most certainly outer space. After one particularly traumatizing night, when Jack wanders out of his hiding spot to observe the sleeping adults and is frightened by both Nick and an instance of physical violence against Ma, the fatigued woman realizes that she must coach the young boy into aiding with an escape plan to finally rid them of the restrictive imprisonment of the room. Providing any more details would soften the impact of the film, and this is one that is meant to be felt  even if it's a true kick in the gut. For the first half of the film, we as viewers are held prisoners right along with Ma and Jack. We see what a patient and wonderful mother she is as she strives to provide some semblance of hope for her son, though in a nearly hopeless situation. When Jack turns 5, Ma begins to explain the outside world to him, as she knows they must try to escape in order for her son to have any semblance of a normal life. During this time, we are in awe of this 10 x 10 environment and how it is every bit the nightmare we have imagined while reading the articles and seeing the reports on real life ordeals. The second half of the film is equally fascinating, as we watch young Jack and his sense of wonder and caution at discovering the real world. We also see the psychological trauma that Ma experiences after staying strong for so long. Assimilating into society brings different challenges for both Ma and Jack, plus those of her mother (Joan Allen), her father (William H Macy) and her mom's new beau (Tom McCamus). The film doesn't shy away from their reactions, though some are easier to stomach than others. The different approach is felt immediately as Abrahamson traps us with his two principle characters, Ma and Jack, in tight and sometimes oddly framed closeups. It's a somewhat clumsy execution to show the claustrophobia and intimacy Abrahamson wants to achieve as he uses Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's faces as blank canvases, but the effect is thoroughly felt, and the film's following 30 minutes remain its best. The photography decides to take a step back, but it continues to catch that raw emotion. Then, in a way, it doesn't go far enough. But it's interesting to watch it play in its happy medium. It does rely on some key contrivances to get there, such as the kidnapper's wonky perception and ultimately not fighting hard enough when he could have, but that doesn't take away from the gripping escape sequence as the orchestra swells and squeezes tears from you whether you like it or not. The only criticism of the directorial style was the lapse in direction that the story was supposed to take towards the end of the film. The entire time the story was told through the eyes of Jack. However, towards the last part of the movie, there was a shift that included some of Ma's point of view. This slightly took away from the ways a five year old would try to explain certain behaviors or actions of adults. Also, for those who have read the book, don't expect the movie to include every aspect of it. Just like every other film based on books, graphic novels, comics, or even true events, only certain aspects can be adapted and some must be altered in order to try and make the best move possible. The performances are superb and so consistent with the storyline, there isn't any pretense that any of this was stage or acted. The relationships are well developed within the timeframe of the movie and are delightfully varied to reveal the breadth of human responses to such a tragedy. Brie Larson had not only shown potential but delivered the goods with 2013's Short Term 12. It's a similar environment here with devoted maternal instincts but this time it's pushed to the brink of her skills as an actress. She's drenched in this exasperation that speaks to years of exhaustion. In the tone of her primal performance, she paints a full rich portrait of Joy's whole life from her carefree teen years to her brutal capture by Old Nick when she was 17, to every little story and lesson she's told Jack. Joy's constantly revising the way she raises Jack and while there's bumps in the road, it's a complete picture of motherhood. She balances resilience and vulnerability, hope and dejection with a fine tooth comb. Most times she commands the screen and offers one of the year's best performances. It's a film about the harsh realities of growing up, operating for both of the main characters, and it's a very sensitive and emotionally potent portrayal. Speaking of which, Jacob Tremblay may be the frontrunner for most supporting actor awards as his performance is better then a lot of child actors. How they got a kid this young to pull off the necessary emotions that few adult can properly show off? I don't know, but this is defiantly his movie. Is perception on the world and the adults around him remind us why we were frightened by the rest of the world as children. When our parents aren't around, we might as well be on an alien planet, stepping around strange sounds and sights. This child made me realize how one can see the world differently at a different age. Joan Allen, as Joy's mother, is heartfelt and shows unconditional love in a wonderfully nuanced way, whereas William H. Macy, Joy's father, is regretfully underused but doing the 'in over his head' thing Macy does best. On the whole, 'Room' is an emotional journey through trauma and discovery with the help of a very strong storytelling and acting. Room fell short in some aspects, though they did not sufficiently diminish the overall experience of the film. It brings different concepts for those to learn from, such as the importance of family, experience, and empathy towards others. If you want to escape the confinements of recent big budget films, or want to experience something moving that you will not forget, go see Room. The film deserves a watch!",

I met Brie Larson and she said to me \"Nice meeting you Doc Afshan\". I also asked her the question which she answered to my full satisfaction. I really liked Brie Larson that being on such great heights of success she is such a down to earth person. Not only is she beautiful but also so warm to talk as if you are talking to your friend whom you know for ages.\nRoom is  a 2015 Canadian-Irish drama thriller film written by Emma Donoghue, based on her best- selling novel of the same name and directed by Lenny Abrahamson  The film stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H. Macy. It was shown in the special presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, after premiering at Telluride Film Festival. The film is scheduled to be released in a limited release on October 16, 2015, before being released nationwide on November 6, 2015, by A24 Films .\nIn this film I saw my Jugaad philosophy as the actress Brie Larson in order to escape from the sexual abuse she thought out of the box and came up with a successful strategy. My Jugaad philosophy is explained in detail in the book which I have written:\n My Book:  The Modern Mughal Mentality-New Strategies to Succeed in India and the Global Marketplace  (http://www.amazon.com/Afshan-Naheed-Hashmi/e/B010A8XBLG/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1)\n Hollywood and Bollywood  has always inspired me. All the actors have done a wonderful job especially Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. The movie touches the sensitive topic of sexual abuse with a child born out of this relationship. The journey of seven years in that room and also a five-year child living with her mother.  Jacob Tremblay  a 8-year-old child's acting mesmerized me. Not only me but everybody who sees the film will adore him.\nYou will love the movie and will be engrossed in seeing the movie as it takes beautiful turns and twists.. I predict that this movie is really Oscar -winning material.\nI highly recommend this movie and give it 5 stars.\n Some memorable moments from the event:\nhttps://goo.gl/photos/Q4m95YZMsT9vFkKn9\n Here is the you tube link of the Q and A:\n        https://youtu.be/B9qJsOTsFFo\n To know more about the movie please visit the following sites:\nTrailer of the Film:\nhttps://youtu.be/E_Ci-pAL4eE\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_%282015_film%29\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A24_Films\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brie_Larson\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Tremblay\nCheers from your loving Film-critic and Author!\nDr.Afshan Naheed Hashmi\nwww.afshanhashmi.com\nwww.drafshanhashmi,com",

It is also the story of a young boy whose whole live has been lived within the confines of that shed coming to experience the real world for the first time. For five-year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) the world is only as wide as the one room he & his mother have shared. His concept of reality is the present physical existence as he knows it versus the \"not real\" portrayed on television. When Ma realizes that Jack's youth & her protection will soon not be enough to safeguard him from their captor Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) Ma devises a plan for Jack's escape. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson from a screenplay written by Emma Donoghue who adapted her best-selling novel of the same name, Room is the intensely emotional story of a mother's love & protection of her child. Just as in her previous performance in Short Term 12, Brie Larson delivers a marvelous performance that is both fierce & heartbreaking. Newcomer Jacob Tremblay gives an outstanding performance in his debut film. The performances from the rest of the cast were fantastic. MUST-SEE FILM OF THE YEAR.",

The film starts when Jack is turning 5 and her mom is doing her best effort to celebrate this landmark, by baking a cake. Throughout the film develops, the audience discover that they are locked in this room by a guy called Old Nick (Sean Bridges) who bring them supplies every night and also for sex with Ma. Ma was abducted about eight years ago in the film plot. Jack is living in a reality that is only portrayed in his personal window to the world, the television. Ironically the real window of the world for Ma is the skylight in this room, she can see the seasons and the time of the day, but for Jack is nothing. He don't know how the real world is and his sense of space is limited but the fact that Ma is the only person that he ever interacted. For Jack the room is a confined world but is a world of fantasies, sounds, smells and strange voices ( Old Nick paying a visit to Ma every night for sex)\n\nMa tries to give Jack some education by making him read books like Alice and Wonderland, but Ma also wants to escape and give Jack the life that he deserve. The process won't be easy...The escape is a beautiful and poetic moment which is also the biggest revelation for Jack been free for the first time. \n\nThe film Room is a very difficult film to watch, is a movie about the love of a mother for his child, the wounds of a person been abducted for years, the adaptation of a little boy to the real world, but also is a movie about justice and human and family values.\n\nBrie Larson is outstanding in this role as well Jacob Tremblay, the film, is really well edited and well directed who carefully crafted with the art direction team the perfect space to make the audience feel locked in that Room.\n\nOne of the lack in this movie is the development of Ma's dad Robert Newsome (Willam H Macy) his character become important when a pivotal moment happen in the movie and later vanished from everyone's mind.",

            "content": "Which of the following situations would you find the most traumatic? (1) You are kidnapped, removed from everyone and everything you know and love, never knowing if you will ever be free again. (2) You are born into a captivity in which you know hardly anything about what most people take for granted as \"the world\" and then are suddenly thrust into that world with almost no understanding of what you're seeing, what to do or how to behave. Stop. Think about it. Either situation would be a horribly upsetting and disorienting to experience. We see both situations play out in the fictional drama \"Room\" (R, 1:58). Although the film is not based on any specific real-life story, it does have a strong basis in reality - in the cases that we occasionally see on the news or in a true-crime TV drama. A young woman is taken captive by a monstrous person who holds her for years against her will. In some cases, innocent children are born into such situations, knowing nothing but confinement, with only a mother's love to depend on. \n\nJoy Newsome (Brie Larson) was seventeen when a man who claimed that he needed help with a sick dog abducted Joy and imprisoned her in the garden shed in his back yard. The man (Sean Bridgers), whose name Joy didn't know (simply referring to him as \"Old Nick\") kept Joy as a sex slave, bringing her just enough food and other essentials to survive. He brought her supplies once a week, but visited her for sex every night. Eventually, Old Nick's ongoing rape of Joy produced a baby boy.  Joy named him Jack. Jack only knows Joy as \"Ma\". He has never even seen Old Nick. At a set time every night, Joy sends Jack to sleep on the floor of the wardrobe in the corner of the room. Old Nick punches a code into the door's electronic lock. He enters. He does \"his business\" and leaves. Jack is now free to climb into bed with Ma.\n\nThe days belong to Joy and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). He's now five years old. He has never had a haircut, never seen a doctor and never left Room. The wardrobe where he sleeps when Old Nick comes calling, Ma's bed, a toilet, bathtub, sink, toaster oven, small table and old television is all Jack has ever known. As far as he knows, the world he sees on TV is all made up and the small skylight in the roof of the shed is outer space. To Jack, there simply is nothing else but Room, the mysterious voice of Old Nick, and Ma. For her part, Joy does all she can for Jack. She \"cooks\" the meager rations that Old Nick brings and she breastfeeds Jack. She's his teacher, his playmate, his protector and, basically the only person who exists.\n\nAs hard as Joy works to make a life for her and Jack in Room, their situation is starting to change, calling their long-term survival into question. Joy has tried to escape before, but it becomes clear to her that she has to try again. Maybe Jack is now old enough to help - if she can get him to understand her plan. It isn't a spoiler to reveal that Joy's escape plan works, because that is what the second half of this movie is about. Joy is reunited with her mother (Joan Allen) and father (William H. Macy), who are now divorced. Joy and Jack move in with her mother and her mother's boyfriend (Tom McCamus) who do their best to help Joy and Jack adjust to their newfound freedom, with all that means for each of them.\n\nThese adjustments aren't be easy. Jack has to learn... everything that you and I take for granted about our world. Joy has to try to get past the emotional trauma of seven years of captivity and having raised a son in that environment. Then, of course, there are certain legal questions that a family lawyer is now there to handle... and the media circus that naturally accompanies such stories in real life. This film doesn't dwell on the legal or public aspects of this case, but those elements are there in the background, even while this dramatically changed family focuses on finding a way to forge fresh bonds and move forward in the most difficult of situations.\n\n\"Room\" is as remarkable as the story it portrays. Basing the film on the 2010 novel by Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay) frees the plot to explore a wide variety of issues without being confined to the details of one specific real-life case. Telling the story through Jack's eyes (complete with a judicious use of well-written narration by the boy) helps us to understand the wide ranging implications of such an experience for Jack, his mother and his newfound family. Director Lenny Abrahamson takes full advantage of these story-telling opportunities with his use of camera angles and the markedly different tone in the movie's very different halves. Topping it all off are exceptionally affecting performances by all the main characters - especially Larson and Tremblay. Although the pacing of the film sometimes lags unnecessarily, there is no criticizing this film's emotional impact and the importance of the lessons that it teaches its audience. I have no room to give this film anything less than an \"A\".",

Macy. \nThe film is about a woman named Joy \"Ma\" Newsome who was abducted and held captive in a room for seven years, and her son, Jack who is five years old and has been living inside that particular room his entire life. The film follows their attempt at escaping from that place and as we see through Jack's eyes, his experience of the outside world for the first time in his life.\nThis is definitely at the top of my best movies of the year, simply because it is incredibly done and perfectly portrayed. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give some of the best performances I've ever seen in my life in any movie what so ever. The kid, Jacob, is phenomenal and surprisingly he carries it all throughout. You'd think that an amazing actress like Brie, and her character would be the center of the movie but that's actually not the case. As she says so in the movie, her kid saves her many times, and that goes to show just how different and amazingly done this movie really is. \nThe director (Lenny Abrahamson) also did a very good job here, as he kept us interested and entertained through the first part of the movie when they're in the room. That is really hard to do, considering that there are not much things to do or a lot of different ways to go about it but this director did it. The music composed by Stephen Rennicks is very touching and gives those very much needed and present emotional moments meaning and heart. \nI think that one of the main reasons as to why this movie worked so wonderfully well was the screenplay written by the author of the original book that this movie is based upon, Emma Donoghue. More movies should take notice of this and be loyal to the main source because that's the best way to succeed at making an adaptation.\nI pretty much loved everything about this movie, it was touching, filled with incredible performances, very good cinematography, great directing that conclude to the perfectness that this movie is.",

            "content": "With marvelous performances from Tremblay and Larson, \"Room\" is an emotional and life bending journey that will leave you speechless.\n\n'Room\" is a novel adaptation that follows the story of a mother who was taken captivity as a  young teenager. She gave birth to her son, Jack, and was left with no choice but to raise him in a small, confined room. For five years, all Jack knew was that room, and all he had was his mother. Through life changing events, they soon escape Room and must figure out how to make their way in the real world.\n\nTo start out, this movie was amazing. Congratulations to Brie Larson for winning best female actress for her performance here because she truly deserves it. She put on an amazing emotional performance and although she was the star of the film, someone here overtook her spot as best performer in my opinion. With no disrespect, Jacob Tremblay was amazing. He is by far one of the best child actors I've seen in years, and there were more than a few moments where he left my tongue tied. He was so natural for his role and fit perfectly, and at no point did I say \"I'm watching actors on screen\", rather, I felt as though I was watching real people. Those are really the two primary actors throughout the film and they were both perfect. All of the supporting actors, such as Joan Allen and Tom McCamus, all played their roles well, and impressed in small screen time. You should see this movie for the performances alone.\n\nI really fell for the screenplay and the directing in this movie. I really loved all of the little details and the overall story of \"Room\", and the writer really knows how to put so much depth into a single story. This child, Jack, is raised in a single room with limited tangible objects, but he is raised to believe that this is the entire world. The Mother, Joy, has lived here for more than half a decade, and is at the point where she's in agony. The only thing she really has left to live for is her son, and throughout the film, you can really see the difficulties that she has to go through. Seeing one character who's mostly content, and another who can barely live makes for two strong parallels within the film. I really loved the psychological impact upon the characters that resulted due to this isolation, and this movie felt so real. \n\nUltimately, the movie isn't entirely about the people and their experience in this room, but rather the impact that this had on their lives and their struggle to adapt to the real world. It shows on both characters, especially the son, who must make major leaps at such a young age. The movie hits you at an emotional level, and is an intelligent film in every way.\n\nI actually enjoyed the pacing of this movie, and I felt that it moved at a solid pace. I was always intrigued by the current events on screen and it managed to tell this story in an inspiring way. They spent about the first hour of the movie within Room, and spent the last half of the film outside of Room. Going into the film, I expected the film to stay in Room for less than half of the run time. Although I was interested none the less, I do wish they spent less time in Room and spent more time on the outside so that we could see their struggles just a bit more, but that doesn't damage the experience of watching this movie in the end.\n\nThere were also many moments where I was on the verge of tears, and at the very lest, feeling goosebumps up and down my arm. If you think about it, this movie really is dark, but still has an uplifting an inspiring message. For those who really appreciate the art of film making, and for those who want to see amazing screenplays, then watch this film.\n\nThere were also a few moments where I saw the awkward adaptation from novel to film. When a book is put on the big screen, there are obvious moments that few eyes can see (eyes who haven't read the book) that make the film feel a bit sloppy. There are just a couple things or moments that feel out of place, and it seems as though the book went more in depth on a few things that the film lacked on.\n\nIn the end, \"Room\" is probably one of my favorite movies of the year. It was an emotional ride that impressed me throughout. However, I do wish they spent less time in Room, because it felt like they were rushing a bit in the second half to cram the story in. There was also one unresolved side plot that was left untouched, and I would've liked to see everything resolved. I still had a great experience with this film, and if it weren't for those flaws I stated above, this movie would've received a perfect rating. However, I still encourage everyone to view this movie.",

            "content": "It's hard to think of a more emotionally grueling and uplifting movie this year than Room. It drops you right into a scary world and, thanks to its carefully balanced tone, the film eschews sensationalism and gets at the beating heart of its survival story, namely the love and protection of a mother for her son. It is an emotionally powerful story that hits the big moments, the small moments, and everything in between. It left me analyzing it and rethinking it for hours, the repercussions still reverberating through me. \n\nMa (Brie Larson) has been held in a single soundproof room for seven years, the captive of an older man who is termed \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers). Complicating matters is that Ma has a five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) born into this captivity. It is the only world he's known. To spare him the full horror of their circumstances, Ma has created an elaborate world for him that only exists in Room. After his fifth birthday, Ma tries speaking honestly to her son, lifting the veil of kind fabrications. Together they will scheme to escape their one-room world, but it comes with tremendous cost. \n\nIt would be easy to fall onto the more seemly elements of this harrowing story and linger on just how bad things are and the horrifying lengths that Ma has to go through to survive. Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) doesn't have to wallow in depravity to get its point across. There's a sensitivity that manages to temper some of the abuse in a manner that won't make you run out of the room screaming. When Old Nick enters the room for his special time with Ma, we don't need explicit detail to understand what is happening and what Ma is shielding Jack from by demanding he stay in the closet. The reality of their captivity is enough without underlining the worst of the worst for the lowest common denominator. The emotional weight of everything is clear without having to be bludgeoned. The implications are always just peaking around the corners from the safer version of reality Ma has proposed to protect her child. As the audience, we can see the cracks, we can see her front, and we can see the effort and the toll it's taking on Ma. The stakes are clear as well, and so when Ma is instructing Jack and preparing him on their joint escape plan, you'll start to feel waves of anxiety travel through your body. I was shaking with suspense that something could go wrong but also because Ma and Jack are such vulnerable characters that rely upon one another completely. I knew what was going to happen in broad strokes but I was still on the edge of my seat and that's because the movie made me deeply care about the characters and their plight. The escape scene was on par with some of the better suspense sequences in the equally brilliant Sicario. \n\nIt's not really a spoiler to say that Ma and Jack do get out of their one-room prison because the second half of the film deals with the ongoing consequences and challenges of adjustment. We'd like to think that we can be plugged into our old lives after spending time away, but that's just not how things work, let alone for people who have experienced substantial psychological and physical trauma. Ma is struggling to readjust to her old life under the care of her mother, Nancy (Joan Allen). She looks through old high school pictures and you can tell she laments \"what could have been\" and even bears some resentment for her old friends who got to live the lives she should have had. Just because she's free doesn't mean she's better. Her father Robert (William H. Macy), since divorced from Ma's mother, can't even look at Jack because of the pain it causes; Jack is a child of rape, but Ma demands he be acknowledged as her flesh-and-blood, and even that can be too much too soon for Robert. He's more about seeking justice through the courts and as a result stays on the peripheral of the story for most of the movie. There is no exact time table for PTSD and Ma goes through highs and lows, none lower than when pressed with the question of why she held onto Jack after he was born. Would he not have had a better life in someone else's care, assuming Old Nick would have abandoned him rather than kill his own blood? It's a hard question and it stings. \n\nFor an obviously punishing story about the worst of humanity, I am not kidding when I say Room is an uplifting film. The darkness is easy to identify and Old Nick is a fearsome and all too real antagonist, one who could roam our very streets in anonymity. However, what stays with me several days after watching Room is not the suffering but the resiliency of spirit, the knack human beings have to persevere amidst the worst. Ma's recovery is rockier but more understandable for us to trace and relate with. Hers is an experience where she can finally begin to focus on something other than her child's safety and deliverance, namely her own well-being. For Jack, there is no playbook. He's spent his entire life inside a small room and never seen the outside world. His sense of understanding has been extremely limited and yet his sense of exploration is alive. Jack slowly and surely builds trusting relationships with Ma's relatives, engaging in other activities, and acclimating to his new surroundings, reforming his sense of the world. It's ultimately Jack who is able to make the greatest breakthrough to his mother, and it's this moment of sacrifice and love that unleashed the last torrent of my tears. Previously I had cried two times over the horrors and Ma's love as her strength, and it was this final moment, this sharing of his \"Strong,\" that let loose the happy tears. \n\nIt should go without saying but Larson gives an exceptionally powerful performance. After 2013's stupendous Short Term 12, I knew this actress was destined for great things, especially the way she can zero in on a character and inhabit them fully. With Ma (she's never given any other name) Larson is able to convey a multitude of emotions, many of which she has to hide from her son out of loving deference. He can't know just how scared and exhausted she is, though these emotions do take over at time. Larson is tremendous as she exhumes maternal might as she does everything in her power to save the two of them. Early on, she's the character we empathize with the most because she's had her world taken from her and hoping to return. She's so resourceful, from the way she's able to answer her son's questions about the world, to the way she's able to practice and drill their escape plan to a child with no concept of \"outside,\" this is a powerful woman driven by the instinct to endure. When Larson's façade breaks down with Jack, that's when the movie started stabbing me like daggers. In the second half, her character has a long road to go to recovery, if that's even an appropriate word, and Larson gives sensitive and empathetic consideration to every exhausted development. She is easily going to be the one to beat this year for the Best Actress Oscar.\n\nPaired with Larson is the remarkably natural child actor Jacob Tremblay, and his performance is worthy of awards consideration itself. At first his worldview is precocious because of how unique it is, which makes him more a figure of fascination than tragedy. He's bright and active with the world around him, turning household items into useful toys and emotional attachments. The film uses parts of his narration to give better insight into just how he's processing the world he knows versus the world as it exists. These bouts of narration never come across as cloying. As the movie continues, he learns more about how his preconceptions of the world are wrong, but he's more intrigued than frightened. During the escape plan, when Jack gets to see the outside world for the first time, it's a transcendent emotional moment. His guarded behavior around others is necessary as Jack builds positive associations with men who are not Old Nick. Tremblay is utterly magnificent; there is no hint of artifice to his performance, which is especially rewarding considering his is a role that could have been suffocated with eccentricities and tics. You feel like you're watching a child grow before you through supportive nurturing. \n\nWithin the first twenty minutes of watching Room I already knew this was one of the best films of 2015. It just connects so vividly and succinctly, effortlessly powerful and yet skillfully avoiding sensationalism and exploitation while telling an entertaining survival story that still resonates with emotional truth. The performances from mother and son are outstanding and Larson and Tremblay form a heroic duo that take hold of your heart. It doesn't mitigate the darkness or the cruel realities of its premise but Room also doesn't dwell in the darkness, castigating its characters as hapless victims forever broken from their incalculable suffering. They are resourceful and resilient and while their trauma is will not be forgotten it is not the one defining moment of their burgeoning lives. It may sound maudlin but it is the power of love that resonates the longest with Room. That love at first is about protecting the innocent, and then it transforms into healing and acceptance. I hope everybody gets a chance to see Room, a remarkable film with two remarkable performances and plenty to say about the humanizing benefit of love.  \n\nNate's Grade: A",

Following Jack around his tour of the shed, Room immediately gives the audience an idea of the experiences that Jack and his loving \"ma\" have gone through. Knowing nothing of the outside world, Jack has a limited perception of the world, his only experiences coming from television programs and a limited skylight view of the sky, \"Outer Space\". Joy, realizing that she and Jack can no longer live in these conditions, decides that Jack is old enough to know that room isn't all the world is. Questioning her proposition of reality beyond room, Jack throws a fit before calming down and accepting the truth. Soon enough, Joy wants more for her son than solely knowledge of the outside world and begins her plans for their escape. Joy, forging a high fever for Jack, heats his forehead with hot towels, hoping to sell the idea to their captor, a middle-aged and scruffy man by the name of \"Old Nick\". Nick refuses to take Jack to the hospital, instead compromising by bringing antibiotics the next day. Jack and Joy spring to work, coming up with another plan the moment Nick steps out the soundproofed dungeon-like shed. Joy rolls Jack up in a rug, preparing him with the proper instructions for what to do when he is placed in the bed of Nick's truck. Joy sells Nick on the idea that Jack is dead and convinces him to bury Jack somewhere besides his backyard, also forcing Nick to swear that he won't look at Jack's not-so-dead body. Jack follows Joy's instructions carefully and successfully rolls, wiggles, and jumps out of Nick's truck. Jack then bumps into a stranger who calls the cops who then find and free Joy from room and bring the two to a hospital, where they await the arrival of Joy's parents. The remainder of the movie follows Jack and Joy's reintegration into the society they have been held away from for so long, as well as Jack's adaptation to strangers, his family, and the world.\n\n            Though most child actors fail to impress, it would be impossible to overlook the incredible acting of Jacob Tremblay. His portrayal of emotions for such a dark concept is amazing for any actor, but truly marvelous for once so young. As Tremblay ages, one would only hope that he manages to continue to uphold the high standards he has set for himself. Tremblay's performance is truly a spectacle and his mature and emotional acting is sure to catch the eye of the Academy when Oscar season rolls around.\n\n            Danny Cohen, Room's cinematographer, instills meaning in every frame. While still in captivity, Cohen sets the camera just enough off-focus to provide a feeling of subjectivity into the perception of Ma and Jack as captives without detracting audience appeal. Once freed, however, Room's shots flash with brightness before simmering down, showing the journey of Jack as he is thrusted into a bright, sunny, foreign world, a strange reality to him, before he begins to adapt to his new life and new environment. Both beautiful and meaningful, Cohen's cinematography is masterful.\n\nAn instant classic, Room is a masterpiece comprised of beautiful cinematography and fantastic acting. My love for Room knows no boundaries.",

It's also a film that if you're planning on going to see, you shouldn't watch any of the trailers or even read the IMDB synopsis.  Just go out and see one of the best films of the year.  \n\nBrie Larson, who impresses more and more each film she appears in, plays Joy, mother of Jack.  Larson hides the depths of her character for a good portion of the film, which makes the emotional moments all the more powerful later on.  The story of a mother and son trying to escape this 'room' and their whole emotional journey is what drives Room to greatness.  The film itself has a unique structure in that it seems the film could have ended about 45 minutes before it did, but yet it keeps going.  It's not that that time is wasted, but I think the flow and rhythm of the movie isn't always there.  Which is why the emotional moments midway through are what stick out to me most.\n\nJacob Tremblay absolutely kills it as Jack.  At 5 years old and an extremely demanding role, it's hard not to think he deserves some awards attention as well.  He pulls off every emotion that is called of him and his chemistry with Brie Larson couldn't be better.  The supporting cast is really good as well, but that can get into spoiler territory so I'll stick with the two leads.  I also should mention Lenny Abrahamson's directing.  I loved the way he chose to unveil why exactly Jack and his mother are stuck in this room and the revelations that follow.  \n\nRoom as a whole isn't always as smooth as it wants to be, but the performances are among the years best, and I think the story will take you on an unexpected emotional roller coaster.\n\n+Larson\n\n+Tremblay's performance is an anomaly\n\n+Emotional journey\n\n+Meticulous directing\n\n-Second half doesn't live up to the first\n\n8.7/10",

For the son, the room (hence the title) was the whole world since he's spent his entire life in it. And initially, I was like: 'yeah, I'm not really buying this premise.' But once the two finally escape, that's where the strong screenplay and direction come into play. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give once in a lifetime performances that feel unbelievably genuine. If Brie Larson doesn't win Best Actress then....well, I would say that the Academy would lose credibility but they already did by not giving an oscar to Leonardo DiCaprio *cough* and for not giving Best Score to John Williams for \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" Anyways, whatever faults I found with the film--I'm not even going to bring them up--because they're so miniscule that to do so would just undermine the sheer emotion that the film handles so well. Some of those scenes hit heavy, which only allows Jacob Tremblay's performance to shine through even more. There was one scene where two characters were having an argument and I felt that it could have been written better. The next scene--something happens, no spoilers--and a character yells \"call 911,\" that one phrase was said with such conviction and urgency that for a second, I thought it was real. I actually forgot I was watching a movie. \"Room\" deals with some some serious drama with right amount of subtlety and pure power. It's a film that I can easily recommend but, at the same time, I know that it won't be a viewing experience that one can just sit back and enjoy (there's a lot to admire and respect, though).

While the film's premise might sound like it belongs to some god-awful and woefully inelegant made-for-TV movie, this adaptation of Emma Donoghue's 2010 novel is an intimate and emotionally intelligent film that most definitely belongs on the big screen. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson (Frank), the film is as horrifying as it is hopeful, and it is as beautiful as it is devastating. As dark as it often is, Room is just as inspiring as it is tragic, and its combination of tender storytelling and stirring performances makes for an undeniably affecting viewing experience.",

If you do watch the trailer that's fine, but if you wish to avoid knowing what the \"second half\" of this film is like then you should avoid it.\n\nThat being said, in order to avoid commenting on the second half I am referring to, I'll try to talk about issues explored in the film rather than plot content.\nThe basic premise is that a woman and her son live in a shed, which they refer to as simply \"Room,\" years after the woman's abduction by an older man. Their names are Joy and Jack, and they are very codependent.\n\nWhat I did not expect from this film is that it deals with the theme of perception of reality, and how much the environment has an impact on this perception. Jack has only lived in Room his whole life and knows nothing outside of this life. To maintain his innocence, Joy has had to tell stories to build a certain perspective on reality for her son. One of the best scenes of the film is when Joy decides it is better for Jack to know the truth about the world and reality, and Jack's reaction is heartbreaking and played brilliantly by Jacob Tremblay.\n\nI want to say more, but I feel like I would give too much away if I did. In a nutshell, this film deals with issues I never would have imagined to be tackled in a film with this premise. I recommend you see this film unless you find the premise disturbing, though the film is never violent or graphic.\n3.5/4.0",

Actress Brie Larson does an amazing job portraying a kidnapped victim who is abducted as a young teenager and made to live in an outbuilding in her captor's backyard.  While held captive, she has a child named Jack.  The two are never allowed to leave the \"Room.\"   The five year old boy is played brilliantly by Jacob Tremblay who deserved an Oscar for his convincing performance.  Jack captures the thoughts and emotions that a young boy must feel when his whole world during the first five years of his life is confined between four walls with only a young mother's love to guide and protect him.  Ma, Jack's mother, captures the boundless love of a young mother who is forced to raise a child alone under horrid conditions.  \n\tThe story is one that seems to touch every emotion one can feel and makes you feel each one with painful honesty and intensity.  It is not an enjoyable experience, but one you will be glad that you experienced.",

Quite the opposite. She did everything right, but this movie is extremely real in it's portrayal of such an overwhelming situation.

Watching this film just made me think about all those women who have been kidnapped and impregnated by men with no way of escape expected through their own child. You can tell that their children give them the strength for hope. Hope that they will be rescued one day and are able to see their loved ones. I was surprised to see the aftermath of them being rescued. It was interesting because the whole time, we felt as if we were them, either the mother or the child because we don't get to see the outside world until they do.\n\nI can't imagine what it must be like to be a child that hasn't seen the outdoors and hasn't been in contact with anyone apart from your mother. Brie Larson does a terrific job as always and I hope that she gets an Oscar for ether this or any movies she has out in the future which are drama. She is an underrated actor. The little boy in this movie was fantastic. He will definitely get a young Hollywood award.\n\nIn the end, I was glad that I did everything in my power to be able to see this because it is a must see.\n\nP.S.

The young mother, Joy \"Ma\" Newsome, raises her 5-year old son Jack in captivity until the time comes to try an escape attempt.\n\nWith an extraordinary cast and riveting storyline, \"Room\" is one of this year's best films. Brie Larson, as Ma, achieves her most profound film endeavor to date-easily the best female lead performance so far in 2015. Additionally, there's no drop-off in talent from the supporting cast members.\n\nMatching Larson's exceptional effort is the work of costar, Jacob Tremblay, who magnificently portrays her 5-year old son, Jack. Look for \"Room\" to be both Larson's and Tremblay's career ground-breaking moment. Supporting firepower is provided by Academy Award nominees Joan Allen and William H. Macy--both playing Jack's grandparents.\n\nThis is a chilling tale because it takes moviegoers behind shocking newspaper headlines. What starts off as a mother and son survival drama methodically transitions into a story of a daughter and grandson attempting to reintegrate into society. Tremblay's impressive depiction of Jack's overstimulation to his surroundings packs an emotional punch.\n\nHowever, it's Larson's astonishing and heartfelt role that carries this top-shelf film. Larson's amazing transformation from adolescent teen daughter to hostage, and then from young mother to survivor. With stellar acting from both Larson and Tremblay in particular, \"Room\" captivates and grips the audience. Furthermore, it should also net the pair--and this film--numerous award nominations in the coming months.\n\nGrade: A\n\nBased upon the international best-selling novel \"Room\" by Emma Donoghue, Ma and Jack must coexist in the only world the young boy knows; a 10-foot by 10-foot windowless shed containing a modest bed, toilet, bathtub and small kitchen under an overhead skylight.\n\n\"Room\" is an engrossing film that gets stronger and more compelling with each passing minute. Viewers are given a look inside the appalling and cruel circumstances not reported in our 24-hour news cycles. Beyond the shocking living conditions, we find a physically abusive relationship between Ma and her captor--nicknamed Old Nick. Deprived of all but their most basic human needs, Old Nick can't strip away the pair's imagination and hope.",

What he knows of the world outside of the shed he has seen on the small TV set they have or been told to him by his mother.\n\nThe shed has a small sink, 2 chairs, a tub, a bed, a small table, a toaster oven and a closet where Jacob is put in by his mother every time Big Nick comes to rape her. The room is decorated with drawings by the boy and his imagination sees all the things as his friends and the world visible from the very small, very high skylight unimaginable though his mother teaches him to read and explains all the things he sees on the TV as being real.\n\nWe spend the first 50 minutes with mother and son, with short visits by their kidnapper to abuse her, in what could be a claustrophobic segment but we watch the mother use discipline with her son making him exercise, learn to read, follow oral hygiene, break eggs, learn how to cook and use his imagination. Without telling too much one of the most touching scenes for many reasons is when the pair make a cake for his 5th birthday.\n\nThe second half of the film deals with their escape--leave logic at the door as it is the only misfire by director Lenny Abrahamson--and what happens to the mother and son coming into the real world.\n\nBased on her book and writing the screenplay Emma Donoghue does a good job holding our interest in both segments but I wish there had been about 5-15 minutes more regarding the relation between Joy, her mother (Joan Allen), her father (Willaim H. Macy) now divorced, and their reaction to getting their daughter back 7 years after she was kidnapped.\n\nAllen does a excellent job, Macy is wasted in no more than a cameo though his reaction is important to his daughter's freedom. Bridgers, looking like your next door neighbor, is menacing in his lack of looking menacing while  Tom McCamus, as the new man in Allen's and now also in the Joy and Jacob's lives is underplayed.\n\nBrie Larson is strong, weak, protective, questioning, as the mother who wonders whether she could have done better by her son after doing all she could while they were prisoners.\n\nJacob Tremblay is a revelation as 5 year old Jack whether it be using his imagination about the outside world or when he gets there dealing with it. There were a few times he was incomprehensible on the soundtrack where he does some key narration but just by looks and action he carries the scenes whether alone or dealing with the adults.\n\nThis sounds like it may be a depressing film and the theme certainly isn't a light one but Jacob Tremblay, at 9 years old, lifts the film up with his acting, his open face and looking at the world with wonder, showing that children can handle life better than most adults.",

            "content": "\"Room\" is by all accounts a great movie. The acting is some of the best I've seen all year, the story is compelling, the characters interesting and as you follow their plight it's impossible not to get emotionally invested. I urge you to go see it. With that said, I feel like something was lost in translation. Between this film and the novel by Emma Donoghue (who wrote the screenplay, making me ask once again \"What do I know?\") something doesn't sit right with me. Curious? Let's dig in!\n\nJoy (Brie Larson) and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in \"Room\", a space no bigger than a tool shed outfitted with a bed, a television and some living essentials. Its all Jack has ever known. Soon after his fifth birthday Joy informs her son of the truth: there's more to the world than just \"Room\". The man who supplies them with food and clothing (Sean Bridgers) kidnapped Joy when she was 17 and there's a whole world waiting for them, if they can escape.\n\nIf you have seen trailers for this film, you know well ahead what happens in the second half. If you don't I wouldn't say that knowing this gives away so much away that you won't be able to \"Room\", but go in as cold as possible. If you're already in the know rest assured. The extra information did not diminish my enjoyment of \"Room\". It's pretty much impossible not to get involved with what's developing on-screen. Your heart breaks at the very thought of a human being held captive and of another never seeing the outside world. When there is a possibility of escape, no matter how small the odds are you scoot to the edge of your seat because if these two innocents can't be freed, then there's no hope in the world. \n\nThis story follows two people being forced against their will to live out a life they have not chosen and making the best of it and about seeing this nightmare through a lens of innocence. If you put two and two together you will quickly realize that there are some pretty unsettling things happening here (we don't actually see Joy get raped, but happening regularly without a doubt). You're getting worried, but hold on. This is not what I would call a depressing movie. Seeing the characters move through this story and getting to know them is a rewarding experience. It's like volunteering at a homeless shelter. You might not be around beauty and the situation is sad, but there's something about being there, holding the hand of someone who is at rock bottom that enriches you. This is particularly true with this Lenny Abrahamson picture because the characters are drawn in such a realistic fashion. Jack is not just a precautious innocent who always behaves and sits idly by while the world moves around. 5 year olds can be sweet. They can also be frustrating and impatient. The key is that when they're being funny or asking an innocuous question they melt your heart and you fall head over heels in love. Joy is no a saint either, despite the fact that she's undeniably a victim and a strong person for holding onto shreds of hope.\n\nThere is still hope within Jack and when I saw the bond between him and his mother it more than made up for the discomfort that I felt thinking about everything that this scenario entailed. I could never quite get over it completely, and I don't think you`re supposed to, but by the end of the film I think you'll manage to emerge unscathed. Witnessing the character of Jack really begin to evolve and grow despite everything he's missed out on ignites your own healing process. If anything, it'll inspire you to think of children and of the resiliency of the human spirit in a whole new way.\n\nI do have a criticism which I feel needs to be addressed. Ultimately this movie is about self-discovery and exploration. I don't think it pulls it off 100%. I compare the film to a book that I have not read, but I get the feeling that when you find yourself in Jack's for world the first time, you're not supposed to fully grasp what's happening. Is it a science fiction/fantasy story where the whole world really IS just this tiny? In live action, the illusion is never there. As a person living in the real world, you can immediately tell that there is something wrong. The film is essentially told from Jack's point of view but I never felt like I could truly immerse myself and understand how he thought. Similarly, I think there are missed opportunities with the unique aspects that film can bring to a story. It's not a great example, but I think of Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz\", where the use of actors, music and color made it clear that she is in a new world with new rules. It sucked you into this new place to help you understand how different a life it would be. A life lived in a single room could have been conveyed better.\n\nI do not think that most people will feel the same way I did about the \"film\" aspect of \"Room\". Even if you do, there's no denying that it is an emotionally successful and touching account that sucks you in right from the beginning, contains real tension without resorting to any cheap tricks and works as a profound examination of two human beings. Then you've got the performances. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay alone should be enough to compel you to get off your butt and see \"Room\" the performances are on a higher echelon than in most films. For those reasons and more, I'm certain that this is not the last time you will hear of \"Room\". (Theatrical version on the big screen, November 10, 2015)",

She has been locked up for 7 years. The room is about 20x20 and very meager. She has raised a well-mannered, smart boy who is now 5. Her captor comes in every night to have sex with her. She places Jack in the closet while her captor is there. They have survived on little food and almost no sunlight. She tells Jack stories to keep him entertained. One day, she comes up with a plan that gets Jack out and eventually leads police to the shed where she has lived for 7 years. The second part of the film is them learning to live again. Such a moving, disturbing film, but so good.",

Room is a visual representation of the bond between mother and child, which can be heartbreaking at times but always leaves you with a sense of warmth in the end.\n\nHaving read the book, I was more than excited to see its adaptation to the big screen. I could not be happier with the way it came out. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson, for me a newly found director, Room is the story of a women (Brie Larson) who has been held captive in a shed for seven years with her five year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremlay), who was born in that shed. Jack knows nothing of the outside world and as a result, his mother tries to shield him from everything he might not ever experience, and creates a world for him within Room.\n\nThe first half of the movie focuses on this aspect. It is absolutely incredible how Abrahamson is able to portray so much in such a little space. Because of this, there are numerous elements in the background and setting that give you clues about the type of life this boy and his mother have, immersing the viewer deeply into the relationship.\n\nThe second half of the movie focuses on the reality of adjusting to the outside world after escaping and less on their relationship. It is not as strong as the first half of the movie, however, thanks to the brilliant work from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremlay, Room still manages to engage the viewer in an unforgettable manner.\n\nOverall, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremlay manage to draw you into their own little world, from both perspectives, the mother and the five year old. Their reality becomes yours and the small things in life don't seem as small anymore. With amazing direction, beautiful cinematography and set design, and breath taking acting, Room's originality succeeds in every aspect.",

            "content": "Based on the best-selling book of the same title, by Emma Donoghue, \"Room\" tells the harrowing tale of one woman's survival through abduction, imprisonment, rape, motherhood and post-traumatic stress. Sound grim? Well, it is, but it is also beautifully life-affirming. As played by the marvelous young actress Brie Larson (\"Short Term 12\"), Ma - the only name by which we know her, spoken by her 5-year-old son, Jack - is a model of strength and resilience, though prone to occasional (and very understandable) fits of despair. Her universe is limited to a single room, which she shares with Jack - played by the extremely talented (and relative newcomer) Jacob Tremblay - through whose point of view the book is told, a device mostly replicated in the film (for which Donoghue also wrote the script). The first images we see are from Jack's perspective: abstract close-ups of furniture and other objects in the tiny space, which slowly morph into shots of Ma. This is the only world that Jack has ever known, and curious sort that he is, he makes the most of it with his imagination. Mother and son have a deeply intimate bond, soon to be tested. We sense, from the opening, that we are in for a riveting and overwhelming experience, a promise to which Room more than lives up.\n\nThe director, Lenny Abrahamson, last made a movie about a man trapped by his own psychoses, \"Frank.\" There, the self-imposed prison was a papier-mâché head, inside of which actor Michael Fassbender spent most of the movie. Here, the jail may offer more room to maneuver, but it's far more solid. What are the effects of a seven-year kidnapping? How does one cope without hope? Jack, an originally unwanted product of violent sexual assault, is now far less albatross than life preserver. With him, Ma's life has structure and meaning. Without him, she might possibly have long ago surrendered to defeat. In this way, Donoghue weaves a complex tale where good can come from bad, and bad from good. If it comes, the long hoped-for liberation may joyfully unlock one set of doors, only to lead Ma and Jack into a new form of captivity.\n\nI haven't read the book, so a great surprise for me was how the film doesn't end where you'd expect it to. In fact, what starts out feeling like the third act turns out to be but an extension of the central conflict. It's a tribute to both author and director that they never allow their story a pure happy end. That would be disrespectful to the experience. True, most wounds heal over time, but some leave deep scars. Both Ma and Jack will forever be marked by their years in \"room\" (that's how they refer to their space), no matter what good comes later. The film does leave us with a strong sense of mother-child love, which overrides most of the horrors. And thanks to the exceptional performances from Larson and Tremblay - and other members of a fine ensemble cast that includes Joan Allen (\"Georgia O'Keeffe\") and William H. Macy (\"The Sessions\") - the bond between Ma and Jack is a beautiful salve that can, at least, heal the wounds we suffer while watching their plight. ",

            "content": "It's a very unique movie, but what works REALLY works. You will be hit in the feels with this one.\n\nMost of the film is a two person show between Brie Larson and child actor Jacob Tremblay. Both of them give absolutely amazing performances. Tremblay is perfect. Every reaction is spot on, every behavior, every spat with his mother... it's just perfect. Never overdone, never annoying. Kudos to him. \n\nIf Larson hit a home run with Short Term 12, she hit a Grand Slam with this one. She's vulnerable, in one of the most extreme positions of weakness imaginable (she's been locked in a garden shed for 7 years. Tremblay is 5. You do the math), yet the love and warmth she brings to her relationship with Tremblay are just too powerful to ignore. This is just a fantastic performance from Larson. \n\nIf the film has any flaws, it's that it plays its high cards way too soon. The film is neatly cut in two halves, the first half showing Larson and Tremblay's imprisonment and the second showing their difficulty in returning to normalcy, particularly for Tremblay. Poor kid has never known any life other than that garden shed. Unfortunately, the second half isn't as powerful as the first. The rescue of Larson and Tremblay plays like it's the climax of the film, so when it happens, we as the audience are ready at the point to go \"They're safe. Movie over\". Yes, we want to know Larson and Tremblay are going to be okay, but couldn't we just have someone like a doctor or one of Larson's parents say there's going to be an awkward transition period?\n\nEven though the second half isn't as great as the first, that does not diminish Larson or Tremblay. Their chemistry and their performances are fantastic and worth the price of admission. No Tommy Wiseau in this one, sadly.",

The highly astute police officer manages to narrow the location down and successfully finds his mum, Joy Newsome.\n\nThis extraordinary story is a tale about discovery and freedom, a luxury Jack has never known. We see how he discovers the outside world in ways he could never have imagined, as he relishes in the adventure and the excitement we see how he and his Ma adapt back into society and into a life a life that had so far only been a figment of his imagination.",

Maybe not complex to everyone, if you look at the imagery, camerawork, and script choices, there really is something incredible here. After being raised in a room for five years, with no outdoor contact, Jack and his Ma Joy escape and see daylight for the first in a long time. Told through the perspective of the child, he is seeing the world, people, objects, and nature, all for the first time. The emotional impact that has on the story is breathtaking. Brie Larson gives a gut-wrenching performance and I believed every single scene she was in. Starting from a confined room, you really begin to see what the world is truly like and how we take everything for granted that is in it. I loved \"Room\" from start to finish. Although I believe this is a brilliant film overall, I have to complain about the way they were able to escape. It felt a little too easy and then that tension was gone throughout the rest of the film in order to focus on the emotional heft, i.e. the family. In the end, \"Room\" has a very raw and true screenplay, incredible performances, inspiring visuals, and a story that is once in a generation, and we do not get many of those. I wish it did not have an easy way out in the opening act, but overall, I feel I can still give it a perfect score. See this film!",

            "content": "Do you want to watch a movie that will leave you speechless for a good amount of hours? How about a movie that youâ??ll probably never forget due to its poignant, painful story and heartbreaking performances? Room is that movie. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by Emma Donoghue, based on her novel of the same name, Room follows the story of Jack and his mother, whose whole world resides in the inside of a shed; a soundproof, locked shed in the backyard of a creep who has held them captive for years. However, the instinct of survival, and the hope that there is something or some place better on the other side of the wall, is not something that you can lock up by walls, nor shush with sound-proof foams, and it can make a difference.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to start off by praising the PHENOMENAL performances in Room. It is unfathomable that the performances in this film are in fact performances. The emotional strength in them is mostly what makes this film strike us, and let me tell you, it will hit you hard. Brie Larson delivers a courageous and heartbreaking performance as Jackâ??s mom. Torn apart by the traumatic events that found their way into her life, but simultaneously trying to keep her composure to make sure her son is safe, Larson gives her character so much spirit and resilience. Honestly, I canâ??t find an adjective that does justice to the power of Brie Larsonâ??s performance. Definitely one of the best performances Iâ??ve seen this year.\n\nSame goes for Jacob Tremblay, who is just nothing short of sensational. I mean, his performance is probably the best performance Iâ??ve seen from a child actor ever, on par with Anna Paquin in The Piano (1993) and Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999). He superbly portrayed a boy whose world shifted from being confined to the walls of a shed, to the infinity of the world, showing at the same time the inherent, cross-generational desire of human survival. His performance is strong, naive, and smart, but also fearless. He embodied a boy who does not yet comprehend the things that happened to him; being in such an early stage of development does not allow him to make sense of the circumstances he is in. Tremblay portrays that inability to fathom what was happening perfectly. Both Larson and Tremblay SHOULD get nominated for an Academy Award. It would be an understatement to say that I will be very pissed if either of them donâ??t get the nomination.\n\nIn terms of Roomâ??s style, its cinematography is beautiful and amazing; it immerses the audience into Jackâ??s claustrophobic and subjective little world, which makes the movie almost like a full sensory experience; a textured experience where we would feel everything that Jack felt, whether it be despair, happiness, and fear or the texture of the rug in Room. The score by Stephen Rennicks is quite compelling as well, which was a beautiful complement to this moving story. Also, the production design is horrifyingly great given the circumstances of the story. That shed would definitely be in every personâ??s nightmare about being held captive by a creep.\n\nRoom is the most powerful film Iâ??ve seen this year, hands down. It showcases not only the problem of people being held hostage and deprived from their freedom, but also the psychological effects that that ignites in social, familial and interpersonal relationships.  Now I feel really stupid about caring a lot about Matt Damonâ??s character in The Martian. If you cared about him getting out of Mars and surviving, wait until you see Room. Then you will see what caring for a characterâ??s survival intrinsically really feels like (I still love The Martian, it was just the most recent example I could think of). Honestly, this could be my favorite film of the year. Embark on this emotional and heartbreaking journey and see for yourself the power of a great story.",

Adapted from Emma Donoghue's novel (who also supplied the screenplay), Room tells a shocking story, but with a respectful amount of restraint. While necessarily tense throughout, Room finds levity in its central theme regarding a mother-and-child's bonding. Brie Larson gives another seamless performance (she may very well be the best duogenarian actress working in Hollywood), and the 9-year old Jacob Tremblay should be very proud of how powerful his delivery is, as the story is touchingly told through his young character's perspective. If there's one disappointment to Room, it's that the second half doesn't quite measure up to the first. The film's first 40 minutes are the most mesmerizing in terms of cinematography and narrative, before it adopts a more conventional yet still compelling approach. Regardless, Room is a must-see if ever there was one, and a very welcome change of pace for director Lenny Abrahamson, after last year's Frank.",

I have a few issues with the story, mainly how we never learn much about the grandmother, her boyfriend, or the severely underutilized William H Macy as the grandfather.

Larson gives the performance of the year as a woman trapped in a windowless room for seven years with her five-year old son. The first act is harrowing and unsettling and you can feel the dread of the two. As good as Larson is, Jacob Tremblay who plays her son gives one of the best performances from a child actor I have seen in a long time. Both should be mentioned come awards season. The movie is about the love of a mother and child and the innocence of that child who has been hidden from the world his entire life. One of the best films of the year. \n\nGrade: A",

            "content": "STUCK HOME SYNDROME - My Review of ROOM (4 Stars)\n\nDon't let the bright wonderment of the poster fool you, ROOM is one of the most emotionally devastating films of the year, anchored by beyond stellar performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, a young Canadian actor whose focus and range rivals that of Tatum O'Neal in PAPER MOON.  Prepare to be gutted.  \n\nIt's almost impossible to describe this film without spoilers, but I'll do just that.  If you've read Emma Donoghue's novel, of which she adapted for the screen, then you already know the basic premise of a mother (Larson) raising her 5-year-old son, Jack (Tremblay) in a tiny room.  Shielding him from the world for reasons that become clear upon viewing, he doesn't know that any type of life exists beyond his four walls.  Think of this as a much more emotionally vibrant and more honest sister film to LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, which also explored the lengths a parent will go to in order to protect their child.  \n\nMuch of the first half of this film is fraught with unbearable suspense, with the mother doing everything she can to resolve their situation.  Danny King, whose work on LES MISERABLES did not make me a fan, employs a live camera and a lot of shallow focus to put the point of view squarely on the shoulders of our two protagonists.  Yes, it's a claustrophobic experience, but to feel otherwise would be doing the subject matter a disservice.  Director Lenny Abrahamson has made an intimate film about big ideas, and there's very smart economy in its storytelling.  It's overlong by at least 20-30 minutes, however, and with such a generous running time of almost two hours, you would expect a little more to William H. Macy's lightly sketched in, barely there character.   It's not that he's incapable, but he's given way too little to work with here. Not so of Joan Allen, who digs deep with limited screen time as well.  Also tremendously effective in supporting roles are Sean Bridgers, who has a knack for keeping an audience on edge, Wendy Crewson as a journalist who prods just a little bit too much, and Amanda Brugel, as a woman who has to assert herself in order to cut through the muck.  \n\nI could have done without the tin can-style of recording the voiceover, which certainly feels unsettling, but was truly difficult to comprehend at times.  The score by Stephen Rennicks is certainly beautiful and heartfelt, but he could have dialed it back a hair with the final music cue.    There was so much sap in it, I was tempted to call the film MUSHROOM!  Far from it, this is a challenging experience, often seen through tears, and not an easy sit for any parent who worries about their child.  Larson and Tremblay should be firmly in the mix come Awards season.  Larson continually surprises me with her performances.  Looking like Reese Witherspoon's sister, I keep expecting her to act goofy and self-conscious, yet her instincts are so vibrantly attuned to the material, she seems incapable of making a false move.  Whether he has natural abilities or was heavily directed, Tremblay is a highly sympathetic actor whose ability to annoy, infuriate and warm an audience's heart, sometimes within the same scene, is something special to behold.  ROOM is very dark, sad, and sometimes without a shred of hope, yet this tale of a Herculean bond between mother and son is well worth all the sobbing you'll likely find yourself doing afterwards.",

Things slow the moment the kidnapping sex offender appears on screen.  Then, sadly, the film's momentum comes to a screeching halt at the moment the villain reaches a stop sign (unfortunate irony!) and what should've been the most dramatic cinematic moment of the year, fizzles out.  The movie falls off a cliff. The second half is chemistry-free with poorly written, cartoon character subplots unworthy of a bad Lifetime TV movie.  I pray Larson & Tremblay receive the nominations they deserve, but the writer and director need a remedial course in \"Choices Filmmakers Should Avoid At All Costs!\"",

            "content": "I'm a sucker for emotional dramas, and even more so if they deal with difficult and/or sensitive subject matter. ROOM is both of those things and does so in a tasteful fashion. I also haven't been so emotionally invested in a film since probably PRISONERS. The story revolves around and Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Ma (whose real name is Joy) was abducted as a teenager and lives in a garden shed, affectionately (or not so, depending on how you interpret it) referred to as 'Room,' with her now-five-year-old son, Jack. When the opportunity arises, Jack escapes and the real meat of the story begins. First off, I was very impressed with performances in the film. Brie Larson does excellent work, but I was even more surprised by Jacob Tremblay. Even though he's quite young, he was able to convey a dramatic range that, although suiting the role in particular, sometimes isn't achieved by older actors. Playing someone who's spent his entire life in captivity, he portrayed the wide-eyed curiosity required as well as the confusion in someone whose perspective on the world is fundamentally changed. There were a number of intense and/or emotional scenes, and he nailed every single one. I also liked how, even though the story deals with women who have been abducted, there was a bit more going on under the surface. Separating the narrative from the obviously horrible situation in which a woman is raped repeatedly, you can see the film also dealing with the psychological effect when a woman has motherhood thrust upon them, the culture shock when someone who has lived in isolation comes into contact with the \"real world,\" etc. There was a lot going on than a simple escape from captivity, in other words. The only issue I could possibly come up with is that the second half of the film doesn't quite live up to the suspenseful first half. Once mother and son are freed, the narrative drive is somewhat lost, or at least goes into a holding pattern for a while. The difference in pacing is noticeable, although I wasn't terribly bothered by it. And, the film wraps up in a satisfying way anyway. All things considered, ROOM is an extremely compelling story that will have some people reaching for a tissue. It has great performances, cinematography, score, etc., and is certainly one of the best films of 2015.",

And actually, I would venture to say that Jacob Tremblay, who plays Jack, was snubbed. He has a very bright career ahead of him. What I will say is, damn, don't watch this if you're having a bad day, because this is heavy. This gives the few moments of lightness more gravity, but still, this is a lot for two hours. What makes it better is that a lot of the truly awful things are implied. A lot of directors nowadays would go for the shock/in your face factor. But Abrahamson instead took the opposite approach, giving us the puzzle pieces and letting our imaginations put them together.

Larson her isn't so much in top form as she is at her most vulnerable, emotionally wracking, and jaw-droppingly good as she'll ever be, a performance that rocks the year so far for being one of the best acting performances we'll see all of 2015. It's the kind of role you lose yourself in, scene after scene of heartbreak and difficulty. Her role of Joy is one of the most emotionally demanding roles one could ask for and Larson delivers with astounding results. While her performance is part of what makes the film, the film itself doesn't suffer from relying on a single aspect, but is a richly emotional journey about a subject not always explored in film. Jacob Trembly is also particularly good as her son Jack, raised in the most unusual and disturbing of circumstances, a performance that was either made by the actor, the director, or the editor, it doesn't matter as it's incredibly convincing, the perfect balance to Larson's Ma/Joy that creates an unbreakable mother/son dynamic. The script, surprisingly written by the author who shows a surprising amount of screenwriting intelligence, has made a wholly convincing script grounded in reality and humanity along with a director with an eye for realism while remaining in the art of filmmaking. Room is a great film, maybe one of the best so far this year, a richly emotional film of sorrow and heart in the end.

Macy, Megan Park, Cas Anvar, Amanda Brugel, \nJoe Pingue, Tom McCamus and Wendy Crewson.\n\n\"Room\" is an emotional powerhouse of a movie. Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay both give fantastic performances in director Lenny Abrahamson's powerful tale about a mother and her boundless love with her son. It is mostly set in one small location, a room with no windows, just a skylight in the ceiling. Brie Larson has done good work before but this little gem is her best work yet. She's right now, the frontrunner to win Best Actress at the Oscars next February.\n\n\"Room\" is based on a great novel by Emma Donoghue and she also wrote the screenplay which is an excellent one. \"Room\" is a near-perfect movie, it's one of the best movies of the year. As I said before, \"Room\" mostly takes place in a small room with a closet, a bathroom, a bed, a toilet and a kitchen with limited food and supplies. Joy Newsome (Larson) has been captive in this room for seven years now and she has a five-year-old son named Jack (Tremblay). They are prisoners of a man named Old Nick (Sean Bridgers).\n\nAlso known as Ma, Joy has protected his son from the realities of their situation but when Jack turns five, she enlists a plan for them to escape. Jack has never known much about the outside world, his whole life has been surrounded in this dark room. After the escape plan becomes successful, Old Nick is now behind bars and Joy gets reunited with her parents. Robert and Nancy Newsome (William H. Macy and Joan Allen) have since separated and Joy has a long road ahead of her if she wants to get back to real life. Joy is also doing the best she can to bring her son to a normal life after horrific circumstances.\n\nTremblay is absolutely incredible in this movie. Since he has long hair, you might think Jack is a girl but he's not because he was held captive in a small room for five years, that's the reason why he didn't get a haircut. We are immediately captivated by him as he makes the difficult journey from a small room to the outside world. Larson has never been better, she truly deserves the Oscar for Best Actress. She's that good. If the Academy fails to nominate her, they would have to retire that category. Joan Allen, William H. Macy (in a very brief role) and Tom McCamus provide comfort and support as Joy's family members.\n\nProving that she's still one of our very best actresses working today, Joan Allen also gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Joy's mother. This movie is sad and devastating but it is truly worth your time. Please seek out \"Room\" if it's playing in your theater, it's an unforgettable experience.",

This year along with that there was some controversey about a snub toward Black movies and actor. Creed, Straight Out of Compton, Concussion, Chiraq and Beasts of No Nation with actors and actresses in those movies as well being snubbed. I was going to watch those movies anyway (except Chiraq I am still on the fence about watching that). I had already watched SOC. I havent watched Concussion, but I doubt seeing it would change my opinion..laughing at myself cuz people really care what I think..\n I read the book first. I honestly did not care for the book very much.  The movie was ok. I actually wish I would have just saw the movie and never read the book, I am sure I would I have liked the movie so much more.  Watching the movie and seeing so much left out and changed effected my opinion of the movie, but I love Brie Larson and that little boy was super adorable so that made up for it. \n As far as deserving a best picture nomination, I think it was chosen because of the story not the movie. It was more enjoyable than Brookyln..but it really wasn't written near as well as the other movies in this category, now was the acting half as good. Honestly Beasts of No Nation was a more interesting story and Abraham Attah out acted Brie and Jacob..so there is a snub here as far as Best Picture nomination goes.\n As far as the best actress win..as I said I love Brie and I am happy she won..BUT I think Cate should have gotten I mean if we talking about pure acting skills in these two particular movies..but what else would one expect from Cate?",

Brie Larson, who I have been a big champion of with 21 Jump Street, Don Jon, Short Term 12, Trainwreck, and her great TV role on United States of Tara, is amazing as a woman that was kidnapped and imprisoned in a shed for 7 years of her life. It is just unimaginable the torment of being in the same room for 7 years with little supplies and obviously the sexual torment of the kidnapper that led to the birth of Jacob Tremblay's character. Jacob Tremblay is great here and there is a lot of buzz about both actors getting award recognition which is warranted but if Jacob is nominated as a Supporting Actor as he is being campaigned for, that will be singlehandedly the biggest Oscar crime in the history of the show as Tremblay is the commanding force of the movie being in almost every scene and even narrating the movie. But I digress. What it so great about his performance is the factor of only knowing what the world looks like assuming it is this room he is in. He has never seen cars, a fast food restaurant, a hospital, or other people for that matter. The scenes of him just discovering the world for the first time are really powerful stuff that makes you think about how you would have dealt with such a scenario. Joan Allen is really powerful as Larson's mom with this dynamite confrontation between her and Larson but equally powerful with the bonding between her in Jacob. William H. Macy is so great as an actor that he was only in a scene within seconds and broke my heart immediately to the point I was seconds away from crying. That happened twice in the movie, that scene and when Larson finally gets out of the room which I don't think is a spoiler if you've seen the trailer and or realize the inclusion of many other characters. The set decorator and production designer did a great job designing Room making it look very possible to live in but still a small living space as the work of the cinematography enhances. There are some really wonderful moments cinematography wise like the first time Jacob sees the sky in the back of a truck and some of the subtle things that happen in Room. That's what I enjoyed about this movie the most, it could have been an over the top hostage movie but it had so much subtly to most scenes and it was quite nuanced than other movies of the same topic. The wiring is excellent, the direction is superb, the score is powerful though was a bit impeding during some scenes, and a great ensemble. My two quarrels with the movie would have to lie with William H. Macy's character and this unexplained hostility that happens during a dinner scene. It just felt in the end odd placement and even odder that it was never explained why it was such a hostile moment. I would have liked more of Macy and maybe a few more scenes of Jacob discovering the world for the first time. Other than that, this is a harrowing but powerful movie that is a must see.",

The woman (Brie Larson) has always told Jack (Jacob Tremblay) that \"outer space\" is all that exists outside Room; as far as Jack is concerned, this is the gospel truth and the universe consists of Room and Room alone.\n\nIt is not giving anything away to note that Ma and Jack escape Room, as the movie is more about the ability of each to cope with the outside world. For Jack, every step and every breath outside is a wholly new experience. Ma, despite having lived for 17 years before coming to Room, encounters different obstacles - the world has moved on, and she doubts her own ability as a mother to Jack.\n\nI had been expecting a suspenseful drama-thriller about a daring escape, given the various synopses I'd read. (The movie is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue, which is itself loosely based on real events.) Much of the first half of the film, though, concentrates on life inside Room for Ma and Jack. Ma uses her strong will and infinite patience to convince Jack for five years that all is well and that what they have is a normal life, that what they see on television is not real, but everything from the single bed to the lidless toilet tank is definitely real. Ma sacrifices as much as she can to keep Jack happy and (relatively) safe, even to the point of giving herself over to her captor on a regular basis in exchange for food and other items for Jack and herself.\n\nTo say that this first half moves slowly would be to understate things. We don't just get a slice of the life that the duo leads; we get the entire pie, and most of it just isn't all that exciting or intriguing. We do get to see a little into the characters of the characters, pardon the phrasing. We see that Jack doesn't like to not get his way or to have his worldview challenged. Then again, who does at age 5? We see that Ma is often calm but firm with her young charge. It's a small Room, after all; no need to go nuclear when there's really no point to it. In any event, much time is spent watching their everyday sheltered lives. Because the general plot involved their lives beyond Room, I began to grow impatient: Were they going to spend the entire movie in Room, only to escape in the final minutes? Why wouldn't anything happen? The fact that Ma and Jack would eventually escape left the first half of the movie perfectly devoid of suspense. Although still waters do often run deep, I didn't really feel like I was getting a lot out of watching a whole lot of nothing.\n\nOnce they do escape, though, things pick up. The focus quickly shifts from a struggle for survival to a struggle to understand. Ma's parents, played by Joan Allen and William H. Macy, have different reactions to the return of their daughter and the arrival of their new (to them) grandson. In the five years since Ma's abduction, her parents have separated; her dad lives on the other side of the country now, and her mom lives with her friend Leo (Tom McCamus). With Ma's return, there's a lot of media hype, and lawyers, atop a potent array of stress factors. Escaping may have been the easy part.\n\nThe acting is uniformly terrific. Larson's work is powerful, evocative, and heart-wrenching, and it's definitely award worthy. Allen and Macy also excel with perhaps the best work in their respective careers, and that's saying something. Young Tremblay is also very good - as is his character, a plucky, long-haired cherub who's more at home in Room than in the outside world (and with good reason).\n\nBut the acting cannot overcome what's basically a very turgid script. Room is punchless at its core, and it would be a total waste if it weren't for the Herculean efforts of its talented cast. When there is no action, I look for meaning. When there is no meaning or action, I look for the exit. Room suffers from spending too much time contemplating things and not enough time doing them - or at least discussing them. Forget the action, I wouldn't have minded seeing more reaction. The first half of the movie could have been subtitled \"A Series of Plodding Events.\" The second half goes a long way toward saving the first, thanks in part to additional characters and a fresh setting, but it's not enough to save the entire movie.",

Ma's suicide attempt was awful glossy, as was the interview, while other topics were barely addressed at all. I get that this is a tough topic and I'm at as much of a loss on how to address it as anyone but I wish that Abrahamson had cut a little deeper on this one. You get the feeling that there isn't anything wrong with Room as is but what it could have been might have really been something else.

The film, which rides on its two leads, is powerful and engaging, making the audience feel isolated and scared. Out of all the elements and effort that was put into this film it is really the acting, specifically Larson and Trembly who this film would not work without.\n\nRoom is a very well rounded film. It is solid on all fronts including direction, writing, cinematography, and above all acting. It is a very small film with a very small budget. This makes the film even more reliant on storytelling and character development. These two both have very emotional and realistic character arcs, with very talented rising stars to portray them. Larson and Trembly are both in the race for best actress and best supporting actor, but it is definitely Larson who will get much awards praise.\n\nRoom, though well rounded, is an imperfect film. The suspense does peak and reach its height at the end of its first act. There is nothing much it except one other scene later on in the film. After the peak, it becomes less interesting, but still entertaining and powerful. Another problem is the character of William H. Macy, who is obviously the most recognizable actor in the whole film. His character arc feels unfinished and feels as if he was only available for one or two days on set, which resulted in less appearances by what could've been a very intriguing arc.\n\nOverall the film delivers on its promises, a suspenseful film with a glimmer of hope. With great performances and inspiring storytelling, though imperfect, manages to join many in the race for best picture. \n\nRating: 8.3 (A-)",

This film follows the story of Joy and Jack; they are stuck in a garden shed after Old Nick captured her as a 17 year old. It's now been 7 years and everyday Nick comes home and sexually abuses Joy (which is how Jack was born in the first place). While Joy tries everything in her power to escape what Jack calls \"Room\", he wants to stay because it's the only world he's adapted to. There would be times where I'd be getting frustrated because of the things that Joy and Jack did, but the more I thought about it, the more sense it made. I had to put myself in their shoes and see what it'd be like if I were in those arguments. Its a difficult situation to handle, in fact, there were many difficult situations that were handled flawlessly (by writers anyhow). There's a moment where Joy is trying to describe how the \"real\" world is compared to the things on TV and in \"Room\" and Jack has a hard time understanding but it's handled super well. There has to be an understanding if you want to watch this film because it's not for faint of heart. It's a film that will tear you limb by limb. None of the emotion feels abused because of how realistic this situation actually feels. The emotion and passion on screen feels genuine and heartbreaking and I really appreciate that, especially in a movie like this. The acting in this film is probably one of the best leads I've ever seen in a movie. Brie Larson has an extremely hard role to play and she stunned me. Her performance was heartbreaking, passionate, realistic, and inspiring in the way that she was able to conquer her personal demons and those extremely hard 7 years taken hostage. Jacob Tremblay gave the best child performance I've ever seen and that might just be an understatement. Like Larson, he had a really difficult role to play, and knocked it so far out of the park! He has an extremely bright future ahead of him. The supporting cast is also very good, like Joan Allen and William H Macy. Through the amazing storytelling and performances, this movie is a massive tearjerker. Everyone in my theater cried at least once and sniffled for a lot of the run time. There's a really strong connection between characters and I felt that great bond. I felt like I knew the characters in the end. I understood their motivations and antics and it was a pleasure to watch their character unfold. Room was an absolute delight to watch. There's a lot of realistic situations that the characters are put through and it's really scary to think too deep into it. This movie succeeds at everything it was going for and then some. A",

The idea of getting lost down a rabbit hole or your life not going the way you'd imagined it when you were a child is universal. The metaphors and analogies to be made are no doubt endless with any aspect of any single person's life, but Room is a certain kind of Alice story as you can feel the loss of our protagonist both physically and psychologically. Loss is a key word, a key theme if you will given the circumstances of the situation presented in the film, but if you don't know that situation going in you're all the better for it. All that is necessary to know is that Brie Larson plays Joy Newsome, a woman who has seemingly been trapped in a single room shack for an ungodly amount of time while having raised her five year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), in this confinement for the entirety of his life. There is only a single door in their room and it is protected by a locking system that only a mysterious visitor (Sean Bridgers) knows the code to. This stranger, referred to as \"Old Nick\", brings Joy and Jack food once a week, but like the majority of the supporting characters in any Alice story, he is cruel towards our heroine. Knowing little more than this myself before walking in, Room operates as a tense and unnerving thriller for it's first half before becoming an intense psychological trip in it's second. Both are equally engaging as is the film as a whole.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

From Jack's point of view, which is the opposite of precociousness, the trauma of being kept captive with a limited grasp of the wider world outside the one room shed leads to an extreme innocence to balance all the heartache. His child's innocence offers some truthful observations that were at times refreshing even though his Ma and her family face a darker spirit of hurt and healing. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay as Ma and Jack lead us well through several stages (survival, escape, reintroduction, breakdown, strength and expectancy) in this tale that moves from small scale to big picture.

Room was one of those movies, as I've heard nothing but great things about it and how truly unique it is (from what I heard). It was a real shame that I had to wait for a while to get a chance to watch this movie, because it's been a very slow month over here in jolly good England. But after finally seeing the movie after that long wait, I can say that the movie was pretty underwhelming, and that's really disappointing saying that.\n\nBrie Larson has been sweeping the award season this year, by taking home: The BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics Choice award and the SAG award, and it's very deserving. Brie Larson delivered a tremendous performance and she was without a doubt the best part of this movie. I'm so happy that Larson is finally getting noticed since everyone pretty much forgot about \"Short Term 12\" and her performance in that film that got very unnoticed. Larson shows off her acting skills in this movie and I know for a fact that she will receive an Oscar on Sunday night. She was truly brilliant in this movie and one of her best performance so far.\n\nLenny Abrahamson (director of the movie) brought us the 2014 film \"Frank\", which I really liked and I couldn't wait to see want he will bring to this movie, and what he brought was somewhat of a mix bag for me. I'm happy for him to get an Oscar nomination, but I didn't find anything that special or groundbreaking when it came to it's directing. Most of it is just copy and past from the book that this movie is based on, so Abrahamson can look on what he's doing. I didn't read the book (and never will) but I've heard a lot of people who did read the book say that the book is better than the movie, and even the author herself said the same thing. The directing isn't anything Oscar worthy, but it's decent directing at best for Abrahamson.\n\nThe first act of this movie was very strong and it did kept my interest. That's the biggest positive I had for this movie is it's first act.\n\nJacob Tremblay is an unknown star to me and for everyone else, so this is basically he's break out role. I did look up on what Tremblay has been in before and I found out he was in \"The Smurfs 2\" which wasn't that good. But all that aside, I thought he's performance was alright, nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. He's better than most kids I've seen in recent movies, but I also have seen better ones as well.\n\nNow for the problems: The second act wasn't as strong as the first act. The movie did lose me a couple of times as I became disinterest as it went along.\n\nThe movie did feel like a sugar-coated version of the book and as I said before I haven't even read the book, but for what I heard from other people, the book is more graphic and dark than the movie. I get this question asked a lot when I say the movie sugar-coated from the book, \"Would you rather have graphic scenes of rape from the book\", well if that's what the book is suppose to be, then yeah, and it's not because I want to see someone get raped, but if you what me to give a crap about the characters and their struggle to see how their suffered, then the film makers shouldn't have sugar-coated it. I feel like if this movie was handled by a different director, it would have been a much better movie. The movie is basically telling you that there's violence and rape that happened, but there's nothing really graphic about it. The movie tells you to care about things that it never bothers developing and if you are going to make a movie on a subject like that, and pretend that this horrible thing that happened, again, you shouldn't sugar-coat it. Take \"12 Years a Slave\" as an example: That movie was graphic, brutal, honest and that's what made it an amazing movie, because it took a real life story like slavery that's suppose to make you feel for the character's and makes you look at what their been through and say to yourself \"Wow, that was truly awful\". Now look at Room, we have a single character and the movie is telling you to feel bad for her and what shes been through, but it didn't show any of it, and it's not like it has to be graphic for the sake of it, but it didn't even try to develop it.\n\nOverall Room was very overwhelming and kind of bland. I know a lot of people are going to get mad at me for not loving this movie as they do, but that's just my opinion.",

            "content": "A24 Films, you've done it again. Without knowing a whole lot about Room other than its general synopsis, festival hype, and lack of Tommy Wiseau, Room seemed like a movie that would thrive on its hype and accolades. That doesn't quite matter, though, because Room is just a terrific movie. Following up on the very good Frank, director Lenny Abrahamson has crafted one of the best movies of 2015 full of amazing performances and genuine emotion that doesn't rely on manipulation or exploitation of sympathy. It may lose just a tiny bit of its magic throughout its two-hour runtime, but Room is still an extremely engaging movie that just feels so so so real. The general synopsis of Room sounds like a sleazy horror movie in theory--an abducted mother and her five-year-old son are trapped in a shed for all of the son's life, as they try to get out and flee from their dehumanizing captor. The movie has such great emotional weight to it that it totally avoids being the type of movie that would place its characters in unjust danger or peril for the sake of cheap drama. When there are tears shed while watching Room--and there are many--they're completely earned and feel so cathartic. The film is essentially told from the perspective of a five-year-old boy, and it does a great job at replicating the worldview of a small child. Part of this has to do with the fact that the actor that plays Jack, Jacob Tremblay, is 100 percent convincing. It's so easy for child actors to overact or simply be annoying in general, but this performance is more than a strong child performance--it's a strong performance as a whole. Brie Larson will totally get nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and in a perfect world, she would win. She gives one of the best performances of 2015 that's in turns pitiful, strong, and sympathetic, but always truthful. It's about time that the public gives Brie Larson the praise that she deserves, and after seeing her flexibility in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, 21 Jump Street, Short Term 12, Trainwreck, and now Room, it's just a fact that she's extremely talented. I haven't read the book on which Room is based, but it's a great thing that its author, Emma Donoghue, adapted her own work for the screen. There's such precision in the dialogue's word choice and its successful use of voiceovers--and I never like voiceovers. The only noticeable flaw with Room is that although it doesn't ever become boring, it does seem to lose a bit of its magic towards the end. It isn't very long--it's 118 minutes--but seeing the world from the point of view of a small child and watching the enduring relationship between him and his mother doesn't quite stay as beautiful as it can be for the entire time. Regardless, I was still very much emotionally effected, so that's far from a deal-breaker. Room is one of those movies that makes you appreciate minute things around you, and after seeing the world in a new light, it just makes you feel grateful. Its performances are outstanding, the direction is sensitive, and emotional pull is one of the most notable this year. It isn't quite as consistently amazing as it could have been had they have trimmed up the latter third, but this is still a movie that I'd love to see again. 8.8/10, terrific, two thumbs up, far above average, etc.",

            "content": "Excellent performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay make Room's extremely interesting concept a heartfelt tale of mother-son love. That this concept is reduced to a mother-son love story is something I'm mixed about, but for sure Room is an enjoyable and touching movie. \n\nThe young Jacob Tremblay carries the film on his teeny shoulders with surprising ease. This is a weirdly good performance from a child and I mean that in the best way possible. Tremblay's mature performance effectively conveys his character's ignorance to the world and how he experiences the world for the first time. Brie Larson is great as well as the mother who does her best to protect her son and properly raise him in their strange situation. Her character isn't explored explicitly, since the film is through Jack's eyes, but we understand her through the depth of Larson's performance where she unveils years of psychological torment through her eyes. She is also great in capturing the loving kindness of a mother, no matter how imperfect she may be. Together, Larson and Tremblay have believable and often beautiful chemistry as a small family who has lived in a shed with (pretty much) only each other for five years. \n\nLenny Abrahamson's direction is effective at showing us the world through Jack's eyes. Through his camera, Room (what they refer to their shed as) feels like a home where nothing else needs to exist, and the outside world is often scary or dizzying. Off-kilter angles convey Jack's perspective very organically and the close-ups and handheld movements of the camera capture the emotion of the characters. \n\nWatching the film, I was excited to see where the film would take its concept and how it would choose to study its main characters. After all, the concept is so interesting. The film signaled to me the potential to explore themes of trauma or parenting through this unique scenario. I was let down a little by the end, when it seemed that the film wanted to settle for a sweet mother-son love story when I thought it would go somewhere deeper and more exciting. It seems to understand the psychology of the mother and son, but never quite examines it the way the film practically demands. \n\nIt doesn't fail at being a sweet movie and emotional movie. For me, the emotional peak was in the middle, but nothing made me need tissues despite many having advised audiences to bring them. In presenting a touching story of a mother and son who were each other's strength in overcoming what they did, the movie mostly succeeds, and the two lead performances are unforgettable. I just hoped there would be a little more.",

Jacob Tremblay is brilliant as Jack and he gives a truly revelatory performance and one of the best child performances I've seen in a movie ever. it's wonderfully directed, beautifully written by the author of a novel and she adapts her novel into a film flawlessly. Room is without a doubt the very best film of 2015 and a truly harrowing, rewarding and unforgettable film that I haven't stopped thinking about ever since I saw it and one that I won't soon come to forget.",

            "content": "When coming across the trailer for Room, I got very excited for it, and I decided to read the book for it, which I actually like, so I get to know for what I'm expecting for this movie. So when I finally get to watch it, I honestly really enjoyed it so much. It's about a mother who has a son with her, and she's been in a room for 7 years while her son has been in there for 5 years, so he has no idea about what the world is like. When they finally, not a spoiler since it was in the trailer, escaped from the room, Jack is curious about the outside world and has to deal with it. Brie Larson is absolutely fantastic in this and is the best that I've seen since Short Term 13. I was worried a bit about Jacob Tremblay in this as the first film that I have seen him in was Smurfs 2, and he was not good in that movie, but then again, nothing is great in that film also, but to my surprise, he's really good in Room and was completely the opposite in terms of career for this kid which makes me think that he's got a bright future. Joan Allen is great in it, and I really like the mother and son relationship between Joy and Jack, especially when Joy has to deal with being in a room for many years. When they try to escape, it was very tense to watch and just really want them to get out. The screenwriting by the author herself Emma Donoghue is very well executed and she knew what to put in that are important, and what not to put in that were not that necessary for movie sake. This is probably a nitpick for me, but the only thing that kind of stuck with me, and not in a good way, is the ending. Not that the ending is bad, it's a great ending and definitely shows the realization of it, but from reading the book and seeing the movie, I felt like the ending should've been a few minutes longer as it felt a little too fast for me. It's not gonna take half a star for me because it could a character dealing with it fast, and that's why it went on fast, and also because the movie brought Room to life so much that there's a lot to like in this, and I'm glad that they did their best to adapt the book with fantastic execution.",
