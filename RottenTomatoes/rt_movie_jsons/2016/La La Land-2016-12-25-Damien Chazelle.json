            "content": "\"La La Land\" is a romantic musical drama released in 2016, written and directed by Damien Chazelle. The movie stars Ryan Gosling as Sebastian, a jazz pianist, and Emma Stone as Mia, an aspiring actress. The film follows their love story and their struggle to pursue their dreams in Hollywood.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of \"La La Land\" is the stunning cinematography and the mesmerizing musical numbers. The film's use of bright colors, dynamic camera movements, and creative lighting create a dreamy and immersive atmosphere that transports the audience into the world of the film. The musical numbers are beautifully choreographed and performed, and the songs are catchy and memorable.\n\nThe acting is also a highlight of the movie, with Gosling and Stone delivering strong performances that showcase their chemistry and emotional range. Both actors bring depth and nuance to their characters, and their portrayal of the ups and downs of a romantic relationship is both believable and moving.\n\nThe direction by Damien Chazelle is also noteworthy. He masterfully weaves together the different elements of the film, from the musical numbers to the character development, creating a cohesive and engaging narrative. The pacing of the film is excellent, with each scene flowing seamlessly into the next.\n\nHowever, one of the criticisms of \"La La Land\" is its portrayal of jazz and its historical context. Some critics have argued that the film oversimplifies the genre and fails to recognize the contributions of African American musicians to its development. Additionally, some viewers may find the ending of the film bittersweet and disappointing.\n\nOverall, \"La La Land\" is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful musical romance that showcases the talents of its cast and crew. While it may not be without its flaws, the film is a triumph of modern filmmaking that is sure to captivate audiences with its beautiful music, impressive visuals, and heartfelt story.",

            "content": "Damien Chazelle's Oscar-winning musical 'La La Land' is a colourful story that follows aspiring performers as they embark on a whirlwind journey navigating their careers in bustling Los Angeles. The film brings together both classic Hollywood and modern surroundings in an appealing blend of visual styles.\n\nEmma Stone stars as Mia Dolan, a struggling actress who spends her time working in a coffee shop and booking unsuccessful auditions. When Mia meets jazz enthusiast and aspiring club owner Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling), the two quickly begin a passionate romance. But when the pursuit of their dreams begins to tug at their relationship, they must choose between their once-in-a-lifetime romance or their dream careers.\n\nComing off the success of his 2014 drama 'Whiplash', Damien Chazelle takes a more colourful spin in the director's chair as he gives viewers a magical story fuelled by aspiration and sacrifice. Set against a modern-day Los Angeles backdrop, Chazelle brings these two characters to life in a bold, passionate experience that is a visual feast. The 128-minute runtime allows Stone and Gosling to take viewers on a touching journey that features vivid cinematography and extravagant musical numbers. Chazelle's unique directing style is evident throughout, with smooth, uninterrupted takes being scattered across the film.\n\nWhen the 2017 Academy Awards rolled around, it was no surprise that 'La La Land' would be the most colourful nomination out of the nominees. The lighting and costume design give the film a polychromatic look that appeals to viewers of all ages. As well as incorporating older filmmaking techniques, Chazelle draws inspiration from classic films like 'The Young Girls of Rochefort' and 'Singin' in the Rain' - all of which feature outdoor dances. Despite being taken along on the loved up journey between Sebastian and Mia, viewers can't help but feel distanced from the characters. The lack of backstory prevents viewers from being able to form a close attachment to these characters.\n\nThemes like following your dreams and dreams vs reality seem to be at the forefront of 'La La Land'. Repetitive shots and circular narratives show Sebastian and Mia's journey across the film, even the film's locations plays into the film's morals. Although Los Angeles may be the 'city of dreams', to achieve your aspirations you may still have to make sacrifices. The film leaves its ending up to interpretation, whilst on one hand, you can see the true ending, a homage to the perfect Hollywood ending, or you can see it as a look into what could've been in store for Sebastian and Mia.\n\nDespite Gosling and Stone giving sensational performances, believe it or not, neither were the original choices for their respective roles. Gosling's role was supposed to be played by Miles Teller, who previously worked with Chazelle in 'Whiplash'. Stone's role was originally filled by Emma Watson, who, due to scheduling conflicts, had to drop out. Fans of both Gosling and Stone can watch the pair in the 2011 rom-com 'Crazy, Stupid, Love', and the 2013 thriller 'Gangster Squad'.\n\nIn conclusion, 'La La Land' is an extravagant, bittersweet combination of classic cinema and modern filmmaking. The film makes use of its talented cast in more ways than one, as the leads take on musical roles alongside performative ones and manage to provide a pleasant viewing experience.",

First, La La Land's music created an impression beyond words that stays fresh even after years. There are 15 songs in the movie. I love the song at the very beginning of the movie called\" Another Day of Sun\" which carry the message of never giving up your dream's up. On contrary, if you are not a big musical movie lover, watching La La Land could be big torture for you.Second, I like how the movie poses an unconventional ending as a romantic movie. Compared to most romantic movies which tend to have an idealistic ending- the prince and princess live happily ever after. Third, unlike most romantic movies, La La Land has no R-rated scene. Yet, the romantic comedy element captured the romance well. The director plotted the process in which Mia and Seb fell in love in witty and charming ways. \nLastly, as an international student who came to a different country to accomplish my goals and dreams, watching this film has given me a more personal connection. For romantic relationships, I can resonate well with the dilemma of dream and love. After watching this movie, I rethink my priority of putting family and love in front of career goals. This movie also provides great strength for me to realize my goal as I listen to the movie songs over and over.",

I found it hard to sympathize with Emma Stone's character's acting career objective with all these false notes.  (2) The only dialogue I liked was John Legend's character's criticism of Ryan Gosling's character's view of jazz and opening a jazz club. Since I share this doubt about the sense of opening a jazz club, I could not sympathize with the lead male's objective in the film.  (3) I focused on the film's use of color and jazz music to stay engaged with this film.  (4) Apparently, Emma Stone's character told her husband very little about her previous relationship with Ryan Gosling's character.  Seeing this omission provided an off key end to the film.",

That being said I do enjoy what I've seen, and this film was extremely well done. \n\nDamien Chazelle is an incredible director and this film shows why. The movie does an incredible job of making a modern musical that pays homage to classic cinema. The visuals are phenomenal and have some amazing dream like musical scenes.\n\nEmma Stone gives easily her best performance and Ryan Gosling does an amazing job as well. The two have extremely good chemistry that really make you buy into their characters and their relationship.\n\nMy favourite part about this film is the message. This is definitely a love story and a musical but those elements are not necessarily the focus. This film is about following your dreams and what can happen when you don't give up on them. It shows that you'll have to go through some rough patches and have to endure some struggles but in the end you'll be glad you didn't give up.\n\nI've really been trying to think of gripes and I honestly can't think of any, this movie incredible.

Sure the old musicals could be sad and sweet, but they also banged out rousing tap dance numbers or included comedy to get you laughing at what the protagonists have to overcome.\n\nLa la land always felt like it was filmed on a stage with actors to me. Stand here, line there. Okay sing now--but not too well because you're not a broadway singer, and don't sing an interesting song either (I couldn't hum a single tune from the show except the opening of that very slow piano song they played three separate times). It just felt lacking. Like they should have hired performers instead of actors, or re-worked the songs/cinematography a bit to be more interesting. I mean come on--in the big climax of the film she stands there and sing/tells a story. I don't think she changed expression or moved once and that's supposed to be the audition that finally lands her a role?? It was unbelievable. But even if it had been believable it was unlikeable. Just there. Existing. Like I guess I saw it but I got nothing out of it.\n\nI didn't hate the film but I can already tell I'm going to forget it immediately. It was unmemorable.",

It just tears your heart out! It's charming, lovely, smart, and heart-warming. Emma Stone shined like a diamond in this film, combining the best of her acting, gorgeous looks, and charming character. I could not have picked a better couple for this film than Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Their performance together took my heart to far-away galaxies a hundred times over, and still left me hungry for more! The sheer power of a Steinway and Sons Piano and the soothing, nostalgic sounds it makes, takes this film's power of emotion to a whole other level. The filming was excellent combined with the dancing, music, and setting of each scene. All of it combined made for a mind-blowing romance which deserves all the praise it has received from the hungry critics. Two thumbs way up.",

Similar to Chazeeles another musically focused masterpiece \"Whiplash\" he focuses on self-sacrifice. In Whiplash Neiman gave up his character to become a drumming great, In La La Land Mia and Sebastian give up their love to pursue different dreams. In Whiplash, there's a little glimpse of this theme with Neiman breaking ties with his girlfriend to focus on drumming but Mia and Sebastian's love is the key focus here. It ends on a bittersweet note that's shown incredibly. Both achieve their goals but due to the time and focus it takes to do that they split away. Unlike most relationships ending Mia and Sebastian have no lost love, There is still a deep love and care for each other in the end. There is a stunning showcase of what could've been between these two if the world really was a so-called \"La La Land\" where love and happiness prosper over all, but it grounds the viewer in a painful truth. The genre its plot is set it baits and almost traps the viewer in a false security that all will work out in the end. The bursting colors, happy songs, and romantic dances all by you into the \"La La Land\" All the factors that work towards this is nothing short of filmmaking genius, impeccable directing. The performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were great, with strong chemistry between both. The performances, music, dances and perfectly executed plot makes La La Land one of the finest Musicals to come out in recent history, if not the best.",

            "content": "Having just gotten back from seeing 'La La Land', with a rare day off music college, it came to me that it was one of the best new release/first viewings for me in a while.\n\nVery few films in recent memory has left me leave the cinema with my heart properly warmed, a beaming smile on my face, tears in my eyes, feeling uplifted and properly moved. 'La La Land' however has managed that feat. Would also go further to say that it is one of the best modern film musicals after Disney's Renaissance period in the 90s, and very much a modern classic. Am not surprised at all its award wins and nominations (including being a record breaker at the Golden Globes), and if it does well at the Oscars as well there will be no complaints from me.\n\n'La La Land' clicked with me most likely because of my love for golden age Hollywood, musicals (a somewhat maligned genre these days, but while there are a fair share of not particularly good ones there are a bigger number of great ones and even masterpieces), and how it fondly reminded me of what makes me love them so much. Also because of being able to relate to its themes and conflicts, due to being there myself. The talent was also appetising, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, directed by 'Whiplash's' Damien Chazelle and featuring cameo support from JK Simmons (who coincidentally won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 'Whiplash), John Legend and Rosemarie DeWitt.\n\nIt was just sheer joy to see a film with so much potential deliver on that potential and even more so, having seen a lot of stuff recently film and TV that wasted their potential it was refreshing to see a film actually delivering on it.\n\nVisually, 'La La Land' is a gorgeous-looking film, with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect and cinematography that's not just a dream to behold but inventively done without falling into self-indulgent territory. The music and songs may induce, and has induced, mixed reactions, count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious, emotion-filled and with enough to make one top-tap and hum along.\n\nThe musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with non-stop exuberance. The opening number is especially true to this. The script is warm, funny, affectionate and poignant, and also with an honesty. It's not a complex script, nor did it need to be, and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple. The story is admittedly slight in places, then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmosphere.\n\nSomething that is true with 'La La Land', a film where anybody can relate to its themes. Even more special though is that not only does it pay tribute to musicals and films of the golden age (especially those with MGM), with their bold colour, exuberant marriage of music and dance, it also has a winsomeness and melancholic nature seen in films like 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' yet does it in a way that will appeal hugely to modern audiences. Loved that the two leads' relationship and chemistry was much more complex than the love-at-first-sight sort (far from it, more antagonists turned lovers) with a meet cute first encounter (again also not a case).\n\nChazelle's direction shows someone with a sheer love for film and film-making, more than evident in execution that is affectionate and full-of-life rather than self-indulgent. The chemistry between the two leads and their performances would need to be good to make the film work. No worries there. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone look so natural and at ease together, nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflicts.\n\nBoth of them give terrific performances, performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about. Especially Stone who has never been better in a performance of great expressivity and nuance, so many emotions such as vulnerability, strength, cheekiness, charm and buoyancy with never a hint of a heavy-handed touch. Gosling matches her, if not quite as good, showing a very charismatic presence and an effortless twinkling charm. All the support, although basically cameos, registers memorably.\n\nAll in all, a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

La La Land is a film that never loses its touch. No matter how many times I view it, I always ponder on what could've been, just how Mia and Sebastian do in the final scene.\n\nTo begin, the cast is essentially just Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) who's romance simply never fails to captivate. They simply seem so perfect and made for one another, but yet they're not meant to be together. At a certain point in the film, Sebastian takes Mia to a Jazz club in hopes that she learns the beauty of Jazz music. As they listen to Jazz live, Sebastian states, \"It's conflict, and it's compromise, and it's just... it's NEW every time. It's brand-new every night. It's very, very exciting. And it's dying. It's dying, Mia. It's dying on the vine.\" After countless rewatching, that quote almost represents Mia and Sebastian's relationship throughout the film. From the clashing of Mia not liking jazz, and Sebastian not wanting to name his club \"Seb's\" to the compromising of Mia learning about Jazz through Sebastian and Sebastian naming his club \"Deb's\" due to Mia. Every time we see the pair on screen it's a new thing for them, something new to do or something new that's happening to them and it's very exciting to see... until slowly but surely it dies. On the vine.\n\nDamien Chazelle (Director) makes La La Land feel dreamy and at times, quite literally out-of-this world with the phenomenal musical acts and choreography being placed in magical settings. The feeling of each sequence and film feeling quite literally like the state of their relationship. On top of that, Score composer Justin Hurwitz made some beautiful beautiful pieces of music that fit so elegantly every step of the way. In order to achieve such beautiful images, there is Cinematographer Linus Sandgren to thank for that. All in all, one of the most delightfully pleasing films of all time with an ending that makes you feel as though love can't exist at all.\n\nIn the end, La La Land proves itself as it continues to stand strong within the realm of musicals, romance, and drama without ever becoming cheesy or repetitive. An absolutely phenomenal and gorgeous film that belongs to a city of stars.",

I found this movie very entertaining, but it's not a movie that should be an Oscar winner or Golden Globe winner. It does have a good story, but it's not strong enough for the Oscars or Golden Globe awards, at least in my opinion. Whenever you see a movie like this that's a musical, never pay attention too the paid movie critics reviews, pay attention too the audience reviews instead. Any paid movie critic who is from an online newspaper should get no attention. We have the internet now, social media and movie reviewing/tv show reviewing websites like here on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. We don't need too listen too the paid movie critics' nonsense. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling do a good job with their performances and the cinematography and directing is on cue. The screenplay told the story well. The style of the movie is also good. But again, this kind of a movie is for people who like musicals. I highly recommend this movie for movie fans who like/love musicals, but if you're not into musicals, that's okay, you can skip this one and find another movie that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have done that isn't a musical. All in all, a good and very entertaining picture.",

Camera, costumes, and photography do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to the musical dance sequence elements, making up for the stars limited abilities, but Gosling and Stone give the film a whole lot of heart and soul. They present fully fleshed out characters as compared to most movie musicals where characters are less developed and are more or less simply character archetypes. The old fashioned Gershwin-like score and songs are terrific and Emma Stone has a surprisingly good breathy singing voice. Even if Gosling is less talented in the singing department, he makes up for it with a fine performance. Although\"La La Land\" does bring some welcome realism to it's story not typically seen in musicals, it does not go nearly as dark or subversive as Jacques Demy's \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" or Martin Scorsese's \"New York, New York\" which were more a deconstruction of the musical as a genre. Overall, \"La La Land\" is a charming throwback for fans of old fashioned movie musicals, even if it's more of a novelty than a true classic. Still, I have to admit I prefer Peyton Reed's homage to Rock Hudson and Doris Day films with his \"Down with Love\" which although wasn't really a musical outside of the one closing number, but it's throwback feel was far more nostalgic for me.",

            "content": "An absolute tour de force! One of the most endearing musicals known to man-kind and almost flawless in every way. La La Land follows an aspiring actress and musician who cross paths and bond over their shared passion to achieve their dreams. This is without a doubt the heart and soul of the movie, the acting performances delivered by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are outstanding and the chemistry they shared was a delight to watch! It's incredibly moving to see them open up to each other and express their emotions to one another. The musical segments involving them are an absolute joy as well as you just can't help but smile from ear to ear when they start dancing! Speaking of musical segments, they're all wonderfully done, from the music to the dance choreography to the range of emotions shown off, it's all phenomenal and makes you wanna get up and start dancing yourself! The cinematography, costume design and setting were all executed with such finesse! The lighting and angles used in certain shots is just mind-boggling, from the auditorium scene to the jazz club sequence, you can't help but be amazed! The different time jumps and how they showcase it through the outfits worn by the cast is just as remarkable and improves the immersion drastically and didn't hamper the experience in the slightest. Another thing this movie does fantastically is its interpretation of how we as humans strive to achieve our dreams, it almost brings a tear to your eyes. How they showcase both Mia and Sebastian's drive to achieve those dreams is surprisingly realistic and goes to show that we as humans can achieve anything if we set our mind to it. The pacing was also brisk and upbeat, while it isn't fast-paced, it still isn't boring, every scene feels important to the overarching plot and it never feels like they're panning out the run time. You never get bored whilst watching and you're always interested to see where the story goes next. Finally, the ending was mature, slightly melancholic but still absolutely satisfying! We see how Sebastian and Mia grew apart. However, in the final moments, they see each other one final time, but it isn't a sorrowful moment, it's instead reassuring as they give each other one final glance to signal that they're happy for each other that they both ended up achieving what they set out to do. La La Land is one of those rare movies that remind us why we love cinema to begin with. Such a beautiful, mature and deeply moving film could've never been made if the crew behind it didn't pour their heart and soul into the project! Everyone truly gave it their all and it's a miracle such a movie exists to begin with. Taking all these facts into account, it isn't a shocker it won twelve Oscars! Truly one of the greatest movies of all time!",

So it is in that spirit that I invite anyone to enlighten me on the seemingly universal love for  \"La La Land.\" \nSimply put: I just don't get it.  \nThe fantasy elements, the dance numbers the jazz score and the chemistry of the two leads are all terrific.  The final montage is beautifully done. Even the song lyrics, when not being over-powered by the score, are very nice.  But the story is such a slog and neither Gosling nor Stone have a strong enough voice to carry the show.  \nBoth City of Stars and A Beautiful Night maybe lovely and even \"catchy\" tunes, but they are delivered without any conviction. Gosling sings everything under his breath and Emma's timid little voice only gets going at the end of her last number and by then - it was too late for me. \nI grew up on movie musicals: Westside Story, The Music Man, Bye Bye Birdie. I love the more recent ones like Little Shop of Horrors, Chicago, Les Miserables and even Into the Woods.  Just listen to Ellen Green sing \"Suddenly Seymour\" and \"Somewhere That's Green\" or Rene' Zellwigger's \"Roxie,\" or Hathaway's \"I Dreamed a Dream.\" There are no showstoppers or defining moments like those in La La Land, much to my supreme disappointment.   It's not a bad movie but neither is it a great musical, no matter how much Hollywood fawns all over it.",

Their grownth as individuals while persuing their dreams  is palpable. So real. So true. We won't do the best for us and at the same time for our partner every single time. Turns out what we thought was the best for both, may be not for neither. Some times we comit mistakes. Other times we comit the worst of our entire lifes. And we can't always help it. It's so sad when you feel there's no space for you, your dreams and the dreams of your partner in a relationship (I cried a lot because of it). Life is not always kind to us. Destiny can be a luck, but also a bad luck. But i think, at the end, they found a way to support each other, what was very difficult back then when they were together. They made it in the final scene (Sebastian by chance. Mia without even notice. Both without the primary intention to do it). Maybe the timing wasn't right. Maybe they don't belong together. Maybe they did. Who knows? Even apart, they were a crucial part of each others dreams. Love is L.U.V.: Listening, Understanding and Validating. And I think that was exactly what they did. She fought with him because she knew he wasn't following his dreams. She understood his passion, she validated it because she listened how much it meant to him since the beginning. He got mad because he was willing to sacrifice his dreams for hers and thought he was doing what would make her happy. He validated her dreams too, but listened more to his fears than to her, what she wanted from him: to be there with her when she needed him. The true is that they could only be truly happy if both could see both dreams coming true. They unsdertood that and validated that. But it's not that easy to have everything. Real life it's not flowers and glitter all the time. We need to make our choices and to live with the consequences of it. They couldn't say \"My dream is more worth the try than yours, you need to sacrifice yours so I can live mine.\"  or \"I don't need my dream coming true to be happy, we can live just yours.\" I mean, they could, but the would never do it to each other. And they shouldn't, cause both still needed that. They needed their dreams. So, their happiness for the other one at the end is pure and genuine. They made their choices: they let each other go to live their lifes, to achieve their goals. And they did! And so well done. They were proud of each other. At that moment, they saw with their own eyes that their paths were crossed years ago with a purpose: to not let each other give up on their dream. And, surprisily, life was kind at the end (after being really tough earlier). Life let Mia see Sebs living his dream and Sebs see Mia living hers too. I know that moment hurted like HELL to watch, but they needed that. After all, they sacrificed their love to their dreams to come true, didn't they? They deserved to see each other happiness. \"La la land\" is about the cost of our dreams, the understading that everything happens for a reason even if it's not in the way we wanted, the consequences of our choices and what we are able to do to see the people we love happy. What is true love? Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were impeccable. Emma is always astonishing, Ryan was amazing and improvised so damn well. \"People love what other people are passionate about.\" That's why they fell in love with each other. And that's why I am in love with this movie since 2016.",

But I genuinely believe that this movie will live on, not because of that plunder, but because of the content itself. It's a modern movie musical. Many movies such as \"Hairspray\" and \"Moulin Rouge\" have tried to revive that classic romantic genre, but in my opinion, only \"La La Land\" truly succeeded at this. At times, I forgot that this movie is set in modern times as I found myself reminiscent of the classics, most notably \"Singing In The Rain\".\n\nOne thing I absolutely adore about it is the ending. While tragic, it also just seems authentic. Things don't always work out in real life. Lovers don't always have their happily ever afters like in the fairy tales. We see a tragic montage of what could've been and the tears begin to fall down the audience's faces.\n\nOverall, this movie has a perfect blend of comedy, romance, drama, incredible choreography, beautiful melodies, and phenomenal performances by the leads.",

I imagine this will end up being Chazelle & Hurwitz's magnum opus as they seem born to make this movie, and now they have. Emma's performance grew on me as the movie went on as she really showed a ton of range here, with the whole movie riding on her nailing her performance the way she did. I was less enamored with Gosling, who I've always thought was rather overrated and whose character was given dissatisfyingly rude traits like holding the horn down for no reason whatsoever; his creative differences with Legend came off as awkward and his facial expressions remained subdued the entire movie. The middle of the movie did lag a bit as they stopped doing as many songs and tried to turn my anti-frown upside down, but overall I loved watching this!",

Emma Stone can be a bit hit/miss, combining an occasional relatability with repetitive over-acting. Ryan Gosling has always been a favorite of mine, for his versatility in playing either quiet loners or aggressive hardcases. He is more of a French shower in this one. The screenplay allows the two stars plenty to get their acts on in natural, fast exchanges. The two have history, and their chemistry brings the film up. I'd honestly forgotten about Simmons being in this, Oscar winner for Whiplash. He is always welcome, even if squandered here. John Legend also shows up. Yeah.\n\nLet's get this out of the way: the musical numbers here are nothing remotely special. I don't mean to slag Hurwitz off in any way, but every time the music begins I had the urge to skip. Gosling has dabbled in music, but he cannot support Stone's clear lack of \"the voice\" and fails to convince himself. The set designs and choreography occasionally make up for this shortcoming, but most of the time it is putting lipstick on a pig. The songs do not revolt, but do not entice in the way clearly intentioned by including them in the first place. I must note that most of the jazzy solo instrumentals are decent and the Love Theme is beautiful.\n\nThe story almost transcends the poor musical sequences. The simplicity of two well-matched leads falling in love and then drifting apart against the backdrop of LA.

Although musical isn't my favorite movie genre, the history of the two young artists fascinated me, Mia with her dream of becoming an actress and Sebastian a pianist in love with Jazz with the mission of not let the Jazz die. The movie shows an overproduction and scenarios with many colors. The songs travel through places and memories, of what was and what could it be.\nI especially liked the end of the film, although not expected, it was nice to see that both got to make their dreams come true and are grateful for each other for that. I recommend it to everyone who appreciates a good movie, regardless of the genre.",

Because of this film Damien Chazelle became my favourite Filmmaker and role model. His direction and screenwriting are just so masterful and he really mastered the blocking and the Mise en Sc\u00e8ne here. The Lyrics and Score are outstanding and really fit to the film and it's story. The Production Design mixed with the Costumes are amazingly crafted. As well is the Phenomenal looking Cinematography ( which won some awards including the Academy Award ).

The best elements are the chemistry between the leads, the art direction, the cinematography, and the direction.  There is a fantastic surrealist blend of movie and stage elements, along with a great use of color for a truly innovative visual production.  For a musical about a musician however, the music leaves much to be desired.  While perfectly well written in a vacuum, there is sloppy integration between narrative and song, with a disturbing lack \"pure jazz\" that Gosling's character professes to care so much about.  With the writers' seeming failure to have any interactions with a real musician as research, the film's story is doomed to be a narrow minded caricature of an LA beatnik and the \"dying art\" of jazz.",

Though joyous, the movie was also very bittersweet - which hit me particularly hard due to the tangent the narrative had with my own life at that point in time.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e, who was my friend back then, was someone that I feared would only be in my life for a glimpse moment because I couldn't imagine that she liked me - yet I had incredibly strong emotions for her that I had never felt in my life prior. Eventually, she also started dating another guy during our friendship - which made my life a living hell. Given the context, I strongly related my struggles to the struggles of Ryan's character as he dealt with the same, especially towards the end wherein the love of his life ended up with another guy.\n\nLuckily, I didn't end up with the same fate as Ryan's character.. Nonetheless, it's still a movie that I have a lot of emotions tied to. All in all, a great and memorable movie. More so for me due to how it reflected my own life at the point of watching it.",

This movie is also enhanced by many musical elements with stunning musical dance numbers and cinematography that is just like clouds in a dream. The soundtrack is just beyond great and deserves all the recognition that it earned. When this movie was being advertised I had no interest to see it, I went to go see it just randomly on a Friday night and I was blown away by what Damian Chazelle manage to create. For Someone that is not interested in Jazz, this gave me a new perspective on the genre and made me appreciate it.

The history, cast, scenography, music, all under an excellent direction that knew how to join each of these aspects to make a work of art that transmits emotions that seem as contrary as happiness and sadness with a single scene.\nFirst, the story plays along the line of clich\u00e9 without falling into it and that is what makes it so special, it shows us the ease and simplicity which we can come across someone who will change our lives, but also shows how that person can last long enough to become a burden, how we should be left behind certain things, adding a touch of nostalgia, the famous \"What would have happened if...?\".\nThe cast is wonderful, the roles of Mia and Sebastian seem like they were made specifically for Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. They do an impressive  job, Emma giving Mia joy, spontaneity and charisma, and Ryan giving Sebastian that serious, sarcastic and persevering personality. In addition there are good performances from John Legend, Jessica Rothe, JK Simmons, among others.\nThe scenography is a phenomenal job, it shows us amazing views of Hollywood with an excellent choice of colors that makes us feel exactly the emotion they want, and with all other aspects to take us right to that moment.\nThe music is divine, it's the best thing of the movie, Justin Hurwitz did an impeccable job combining the Jazz style with orchestra. Songs that transmit a thousand emotions by themselves, for example \"The fools who dream\" or \"Someone in the crowd\", added to the excellent visual work. The soundtrack and its title song \"City of Stars\" were decorated at the academy awards.\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this film that envelops you and makes you feel identified with each of the characters. Art that we can appreciate and enjoy through the eyes and ears. Of course, backed by nothing more and nothing less than 6 academy awards and 7 Golden Globes, just to mention some of its 88 awards.",

My favorite scene would definitely be when the two - Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling - start dancing in the planetarium. Emma dancing along with the music with her stunning white dress left me in awe. But I would also pick the starting scene as one of the most iconic scenes ever. How they begin with the normal, dull traffic jam that is probably common in the city from what I heard, but ends up filming a whole musical themselves all of a sudden and I thought that was a great way to start off a movie, especially one like this one as much as it is a musical film. Though what I really liked about the whole storyline was how the main character ends up following her dream, rather than choosing love over what she really wants to accomplish. The two decide to follow what they have been dreaming of accomplishing thougb they share the same amount of love and affection towards each other. Unlike many different movies nowadays, I thought that aspect of being realistic was very special and what made the movie become more popular. Those kinds of parts and stories are what the audience prefer since it is what they can relate to. We watch movies not only to just enjoy the actors or the story, but to relate to something because in my case, movies are what I go to whenever I feel lonely and feel like I have no one to talk to.

The performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are brilliantly done, and I can personally relate to Ryan's character (Sebastian) a lot because of his ethics and what he stands for. That directly relates to the message of the film which is essentially to never give up on your dreams and passions. Special mention to the cinematography in the film, shot by Linus Sandgren, which is mesmerising at times with how LA looks. Finally, the climatic 20/25 minutes of the film is special and the perfect way to conclude this story. The first time I saw it I was not a huge fan, but now after multiple watches I am now convinced this was the way to finish. One of my all-time favourite films! It made me look at films in a new way and La La Land is the main reason I am a film fanatic and student now.\n\nQuote \u2013 \"I'm always gonna love you\" \u2013 Mia\n\nRating \u2013 5/5",

I still listen to the soundtracks 'City of Stars', 'Mia and Seb'. I am frequently playing the tunes in my head, Seb's piano is hands down my favourite, ever so that I started learning piano online and ended when I could play the first part of 'Mia & Seb'\n\nThe long-take dance had masterful choreography and we can see a lot of hard work went into the film.\nThe Purple Sky LA is one the greatest cinematography I have seen, each image could be printed out and seen as ART.\nThe acting of Ryan and Emma was first-class, speacialy Emma in the audition scene. The chemistry is one the best, there is music scene where Ryan messes something up but they both laugh it off and still continue \u2764\n\nRomance films with tragedy/break ups are always my favourites as they stick with me for longer time. This movie is speacial because of the 'What if' sequence. That scene is the most relatable thing I have ever seen in my life.\nI recommend this movie to a person and I still have 'What if' scenarioes of my own with her.\n\nThis is one of those movies I promise myself to see every year.",

In this fantasy of what could have been, the events take place in a shocking, non-sensical way where Sebastian kisses Mia spontaneously when they first meet and is followed by a sequence of events that show how their lives took a better, more fairytale-like, route from there. This imitates the \u2018happily ever after' endings of traditional Hollywood films which push forward the ideology that everything seems to fall into place in favor of the characters.

La La Land delivers some great numbers and a couple of inspiring dance sequences but although I want to start tap-dancing lessons now, La La Land doesn't deliver quite enough satisfaction for me. Maybe it's because I wasn't entirely impressed by Emma Stone's performance or MAYBE the ending turned me off too much (the alternative ending was great though)! Or maybe I just don't like Damien Chazelle films. It's not like First Man (2018) agreed with me either!\n\nSomething that (I later realised) pleases/frustrates me about this film is the attention it brings to a somewhat dying genre; one filled with culture, history and a loose rhythm: jazz. Sebastian touches on how it's become a thing of the past (\"It's conflict and compromise.\") but it's over too fast and you leave the theaters almost forgetting that jazz was even mentioned in the first place. Then again, I could just be a bit of a jazz fanatic \u2026",

Emma (those eyes!) and Ryan (someone's been working out!) are very good actors but aren't trained dancers (that's okay, really and Ryan not quite landing those pinwheels sorta charming and I backed up DVD and watched dance scene set over L.A. several times) or trained vocalists (that's okay, Pierce Bronson sort of charmingly off-key in \"Mama Mia\"). The 'snow' added some magic, but was it cocaine at the pool?  John Legend fine at...being John Legend (but a no-name would have worked better.) I really liked the last 10 minutes with the bittersweet double-end. But the biggest problem here is that I didn't much want to watch Hollywood self-pleasure itself for two hours. I've raised my rating from 1/2 star to 2 stars though.  I like musicals, might try it again! (Oh, the charmingly awful L.A. apartments for Emma and Ryan were amazingly perfect at the beginning of the film, that's unusual.) I might eventually come to love this one, I'm trying! (But why oh why is that opening song so...awful?)\n2020, TRIED TO WATCH ENTIRE FILM on DVD: Kept thinking things like: \"that looks like the choreography from West Side Story\" and \"this song is terrible and the dancing is Way off\" (go ahead, hum one song, give it a try) and then I snoozed off about an hour in.\n2017,ORIGINAL REVIEW: Unfortunately, I saw (the first 30 minutes or so) right after the monumental \"Moonlight\" at AMC's Best Picture Showcase and thought, after the first 3 musical numbers of La La Land: \"this is the worst musical I've ever seen, even worse than 'Grease 2', and besides this is just terrible compared to Moonlight, and left. I'd have asked for my money back, but I felt like \"La La Land\"  was chasing me so I ran to my car and drove away.",

            "content": "\"La La Land\" is simply overflowing with joy. Writer-director Damien Chazelle accomplishes this through the use of homage and pastiche, evoking prior sights and sounds from classic musicals like \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"West Side Story.\" In addition to invoking the exuberance of older styles, Chazelle adds a layer of realism to his film that its influences lacked. Chazelle is not a strict traditionalist holding onto the past, he is a revolutionary, as John Legend's character Keith similarly tells Sebastian. Yes, there is a riveting opening number, a dance sequence that defies gravity, and charming duets between Mia and Sebastian, but there are also scenes when characters get fired from their jobs and decide to give up on their dreams: \"Maybe I'm not good enough!\u2026 Maybe I'm one of those people that has always wanted to do it, but it's like a pipe dream for me,\" Mia laments to Sebastian. In a similar fashion, the film's ending reminds us of the fleeting nature of love. Due to this perfect blend of realism and surrealism, \"La La Land\" has a magic of its own. (\"It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting!\") It is a passionate ode to cinema made for and by \"The Fools Who Dream\" that precisely captures their tortured plight. \"La La Land\" is pure cinematic bliss.",

However, I feel the reason I enjoyed this movie so much is the same reason I enjoyed When Harry Met Sally: rom-coms are something of a guilty pleasure for me.

I didn't care if they got together romantically or if they succeeded in achieving their dreams.  I guess I was supposed to give a crap because they are two young, white, attractive people, but eff that crap.  Also, it figures that fake, phony-ass Hollywood would do a movie about some young, white, attractive man doing the black people a favor by championing  their music, jazz.  This would have been a much better movie if jazzhole Seb had just strangled Mia to death after finding out that she hated jazz.  That would have been more in line with his character.  And, oh yeah, before I forget, the \"City of Stars\" song featured prominently in this movie absolutely sucks and it isn't even jazz!  Just another overrated movie.  Just made in America trash.",

The story I found to be quite predictable, but still gripping, especially in the third act.\n\nThe acting was also really strong, especially Emma Stone as Mia, I found that she portrayed the character really well and gave a gripping performance.\n\nThe worst aspect of the film for me was the characters, mostly because I found them to be quite bland and sometimes even unlikable, but luckily I can say that they weren't the worst characters I've ever seen.\n\nThe cinematography was also really strong and stylistic, with some great shots of the characters and scenery. My personal favourite shot was one toward the end of the film involving Sebastian playing the piano in a spot light.\n\nThe sets in my opinion were also one of the best aspects of the film, especially in the final scenes toward the end.\n\nThe style of the film I personally found to be incredibly strong and stylistic, from the colour scheme and cinematography, to the direction and music.\n\nSpeaking of music, this film in my opinion has a really good and vibrant soundtrack. The music was both written and played really well, especially the one song City of Stars.\n\nThe film also had some very strong atmosphere, especially in the third act with Sebastian and Mia.\n\nThe choreography in the film was also really strong, especially the opening scene with the song Another Day of Sun.\n\nThe film I also very much enjoyed, and I hope to watch it again soon.\n\nOver all I give it a \n8/10",

However, I came away feeling that the sole reason to see this film is to bask in the amazing shots - it is truly a beautiful film. Lighting, staging, color and photography are all top notch, and sometimes transcendent. There is a regularly displayed love of the dolly shot through the film (though in today's tech-wizard film,making, I kept wondering if the oft-used fast-pan was a digital way of cutting between takes, or if it was an actual pan). Disappointingly, everything else gets in the way of the beauty that this film displays. I was surprised that awards were given out for the acting, as it seemed as lacking in depth as the painfully hackneyed plot. I couldn't sympathize with either character as they were both insufferable with no redeeming traits other than their attractiveness (which, to be fair, is commonly the case with struggling LA actors and musicians - but this isn't supposed to be a gritty reality film). I actively wanted their relationship to fail and I usually like silly romantic films (my fave film in the romantic genre is Somewhere in Time). This is a musical, but musicals require BIG songs that you keep humming as you leave the theater and that you want to hear again (think The Music Man, Oliver, West Side Story, Mary Poppins). However, the music in this film was either un-hummable jazz (yes, I do like jazz) or insipid, forgettable songs that I wanted to be over as fast as possible. The vocalists were adequate singers in a bland current-pop sort of way, but that's not how its done in musicals. They're working in a medium that gave us Garland, Minelli, Streisand, Kelly, Preston...these poor La La actors just don't rate.  But, oh - those visuals. They are so good that I kept watching to see what was next. So go to school on the photography and if you get into films because the actors are good to look at, you'll be extra happy.Just don't expect substance or the genuine feel of a Hollywood musical. ",

            "content": "This is the sort of film that makes you detest musicals with how simultaneously twee and self important it is and the fact that the two leads can barely dance and sing. Damien Chazelle directed the very good Whiplash (2014) which explores the pressures of being an artist with dramatic flair but the other two films that he has directed that I have seen have been huge disappointments. This film was frustrating with it's nods to old Hollywood that felt perfunctory instead of feeling like a genuine tribute and it had the sort of half baked qualities that a film like The Artist (2011) possesses. This is not something that anybody should be clamoring to see and it is offensive to the brilliant Moonlight (2016) that this would ever be considered worthy competition to it.\n\nAspiring actress Mia, Emma Stone, tentatively begins a relationship with classical jazz aficionado Sebastian, Ryan Gosling, after they bond at a friend's party. Mia decides to write and perform in a one woman play to jump start her acting career and Sebastian joins a modern jazz band led by Keith, John Legend, who he rebels against as their musical tastes are opposed to his own. Their relationship begins to break down as their ambitions are completely different and their relationship would require a lot of commitment in order to last. They each attain career success but do not end up together and reminisce about the life they could have had when they see each other again years later.\n\nFrom the opening scene of the film in which people in brightly colored clothing jump out of their cars, stuck in a traffic jam, to perform the lackluster song \"Another Day of Sun\" to jerky choreography I knew I hated this film. From this point the film only gets worse as the songs blend together and Stone's monotonous delivery of her lines leaves us rudderless without a charismatic leading lady. I was hoping throughout for some redemptive moment, something that I could pick out and argue in favor of the film for but I was left with nothing. Going into the film I knew that I was particularly tough on musicals, I can only name a few that I actually like, and I detest Stone as an actress but if I can love One from the Heart (1982) and The Favorite (2018) I thought I could tolerate these two elements to find a great film lurking underneath.\n\nThe success of a musical to me rests on the quality of the song and dance numbers and this film lacks any memorable tunes and the choreography is limited as the two lead actors can't dance. Even An American in Paris (1951), which is mostly Leslie Caron being awful and dull conversation, partially rescues itself with a magnificent final scene but the closest this film got to competence was using a cover of A-ha's \"Take on Me\" over the party scene. Gosling simply can't sing as he drawls all of the lines in his big song, \"City of Stars\", and Stone is unconvincing as a dancer or a singer which ruins the film considering the fact that she is lumped with most of the workload. The scene of the two of them dancing on the ceiling of the Griffith Conservatory could have been something beautiful but it is ruined by the scenes before and after it and only really works when divorced from the dislikable characters.\n\nStone's win for Best Actress is blasphemous as she beat out the far superior Isabelle Huppert in Elle (2016) and will now shamefully be placed in the same category as Jessica Lange and Elizabeth Taylor as an actress undeserving of an Academy Award. Gosling doesn't fare much better although he can give great dramatic performances and Legend's role, essentially a cameo, suits him well.\n\nGo watch Gigi (1958) or Kiss Me Kate (1953) if you want an classic MGM musical that actually works but we would all be doing ourselves a favor if this overblown hit was left in the dust. Stone and the poorly written and performed songs tank the film immediately and not one redeemable scene can be found in the film's 128 minute length.",

With successive jaw dropping projects coming out, his passion grows more intense and the cinema much larger. Coloring the 70mm screen with rich mesmeric visuals, the director, Damien Chazelle is boasting his love with proper understanding of the Hollywood culture that he so blindingly adores. Not an inch goes by in the film that looks pretentious, working over a year on editing along with Tom Cross, Chazelle wishes you to understand the \"if's\" and \"but's\" of this show business in one note. And boy what a note it is. I am sorry but that hooked theme of Justin Hurwitz, whispered in every line of the film always sobers me up.\n\nAll hail the production team for carving out this desert as fresh as it looks, from clothes to designing and from locations to set pieces, the view gets better and better and so does the performance. And daunting as this task may sound, but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling might be the new Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. But unlike them they aren't quirky but are goofy about the relationship and flirty about their first love. If Stone going over the montages of failed auditions is a threat, then Gosling on piano is her equal competitor.\n\nI have always preferred them alone, one is happy being stubborn and intuitive- something that she later on adapts from him- and other being mature and hard on herself. Together, they would fall apart, they are meant to be, no matter how in sync are they while dancing and how pitch perfect are they while singing, their rhythm is too vacuumed by the outer world to float in one room, maybe they should have just stayed in that cinema hall, but despite of claiming it to be a La La Land, this is the reality, they had to get out.",

First of all the movie has basically two characters, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's characters are the central focus and it works. They both get nearly equal screen time in order to show off their amazing acting. Not only do they show off their acting, but also dancing and singing, all of which is beautifully sung and choreographed. (This especially applies to Ryan who learned to play piano beautifully just for this movie.) The plot is sweet, romantic, and I always love a tragedy. My favorite aspect of the film are the visuals and the pacing. The movie focuses a lot on color and uses that to paint a fantastical image of Hollywood without being to direct. It helps the plot and determines the mood. The pacing is also perfect; the use of seasons to separate periods of Seb and Mia's relationship works and is timed like they could be chapters in a book. It has a plot that could have been a book integrated with cinematography and musical aspects that I have never seen in a film together.",

This movie is everything.\n\nIt is beautiful, happy, magical, romantic and I could go on for a little while longer but I won't. I wasn't expecting it to be this musical-y, but I mean, I love musicals so I'm not complaining. I think this is a great \"musical\" because there isn't non stop singing, so people who don't like musicals might like this one because it's more \"subtle\". I can only imagine how much practice went into all those dance routines and don't get me started on the impressive piano skills Ryan Gosling showed us.\n\nSomething that really impressed me as well was the way they filmed everything. It's a very creative and different way, which I really enjoyed and think makes this movie a great inspiration for those who love film and camerawork themselves. The build up and flashbacks and stuff were really cool as well. Yea I really enjoyed that. Also, the storyline, which does so much for a movie, was so great.\n\nThis is normally the part were I talk about the actors, but seeing that there were mainly only two actors and they were both amazing (I do think tho, that Ryan Gosling his character wasn't a very challenging one for him because we have seen him in roles like these before. Mixing it up with all the dancing, singing en piano playing though, you got something quite different and I loved it), I'm going to skip this part and say that you should watch this movie, do nothing more, just watch it, enjoyed it and love it.",

            "content": "\"This is the dream! It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting!\"\n\nWhere to start? I'll be honest, based on the trailers that I saw I wasn't very excited to see this; I thought that it would just be average or slightly above and incredibly artsy either way. Let me say, I love being proved wrong when it comes to a film being better than I thought it would be, and I was proven very wrong in this case.\n\nIn my opinion, this is what film making is about. Director Damien Chazelle came out of the gates swinging in 2014 with Whiplash (probably one of my top ten films of all time). He hits the ball out of the park this time by telling the story of Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a jazz pianist and Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress who bump into one another on more than a few occasions resulting in a roller coaster of emotions.\n\nI know that musicals (especially modern day ones) are often looked upon in a certain light by most. Sure there is singing and even several incredible dance numbers in La La Land, yet beyond all of that it has so much more to offer. The story isn't the best ever told but the way it is captured both visually and through the song and dance is almost beyond words. Both Gosling and Stone have achieved what I'd consider their best performances in their careers to this point.\n\nPlease don't go into this expecting Singin' in the Rain, The Sound of Music or even Grease. This film transcends the traditional role of a musical to offer something that I've not seen before. Damien Chazelle's idea was to \"to take the old musical but ground it in real life where things don't always exactly work out.\" He more than succeeded in his vision by crafting a great movie into a fantastic musical. Too often, musicals have strained performances and misplaced song and dance numbers. La La Land has masterful performances with song and dance seamlessly incorporated to enhance the story even further.\n\nMost musicals deliver several great songs; however, this film with John Legend as a producer, delivers incredible songs that have already won awards. \"City of Stars,\" sung by Gosling himself, was a bright point in a film that already had so many. Honestly, before watching this I had no clue that Gosling or Stone could sing. While neither are likely to go on to have exciting musical careers, they both stretched their talents and sung to the level of their characters with perfection.\n\nOne of the few things that I take for granted in film are the captivating visuals. I've seen so many major blockbuster sci-fi adventures that I rarely stop to appreciate the subtlety that a true artist can bring to the screen. Everything from matte paintings, lighting, and cinematography play a role in giving a film a look and feel that take you to another world. The visuals in La La Land are truly a work of art, the colors jump off the screen, and thanks to the lighting throughout, your eyes are directed exactly where they're meant to be. On top of Damien's incredible directorial style, he also wrote both Whiplash and La La Land. Chazelle is a true artist that I'm looking forward to seeing more and more from in the coming years.\n\nWhen I started these reviews, I wanted to make sure I didn't throw around the five star rating lightly. Even Star Wars (which I happen to be a huge fan of) only got 4 1/2. I've given some older films five stars, but this is going to be my exception to the norm. A film like this doesn't come along often and I want it to be known and be seen.",

But the girl, Emma Stone, she was a knockout and a pretty swell actor to boot. She was the only reason the picture was tolerable, and she was the only good dancer out of all those phonies on screen.

An ending that leaves you truly wanting more yet content with what it has provided. I truly recommend this remarkable film for anyone who appreciates the work of this brilliant director!",

            "content": "- Take us away to La La Land. -\n\nWe all know 2016 has been a mare of a year. It feels like with every step forward, we take three steps back. La La Land is like a hug to make us feel a little better, despite all the shit that's gone down.\n\nIn the 1930s, when much of the world suffered from the Great Depression, people turned to the cinemas to enter another dreamscape. In the dim light of the cinema, nestled into their chairs, audiences entered a trance where - for just a little while - all that mattered was Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. Just in time to shake off our 2016 worries, Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) gives us La La Land.\n\nEmma Stone (The Help, Easy A) stars as Mia, a modern day Kathy Selden who jumps from audition to audition trying to break into the Hollywood scene. The story revolves around Mia's romance with Sebastian, who is played by Ryan Gosling (The Notebook; Crazy, Stupid, Love). With eye candy and this good, it's no surprise that La La Land is unabashedly a classic musical.\n\nThe story opens with Mia, it follows Mia's gaze. It's Mia's fantasies we explore all the way through an elaborate finale. There is no question that the musical is a tale of a woman's success - her dreams, her work, her family, and all the messy ways those things can work together. It's a pleasure to watch the chemistry between Stone and Gosling, but in the end, it's not a Gosling film.\n\nAs we settle into the story, we are treated to a scene where the romantic tension between Mia and Sebastian is almost palpable. I was transported to my high-school crushes, to first kisses, and to the absolute buzz of young love. The film triggers an acute and mind-bending sense of nostalgia. Somewhere between the mid-century color schemes and the melancholy piano, the audience starts to yearn for a time when we might have felt good.\n\nAs a side note, despite all of the nostalgic hyperdrive choreographic sequences, there are at least two mannequin-style choreographed scenes (without the annoying song).  I actually have a crazy conspiracy theory that this year's Mannequin Challenge has been a viral marketing campaign for the film.\n\nAs you can see, I'm a cynic at heart. The problems with La La Land mirror the problems with the musical genre as a whole. It's heteronormative, it's privileged, and it's an absolute capitalist fan club. Although the film gives us a welcome release from the malaise of the political mess we are in, it still preaches the morals of hard work and dreamers and success.\n\nIt's a real shame - because straight, white, middle-class \"dreamers\" were not the ones to suffer the most from this year's tragedies. For me, the film sits at a solid 3.5 stars because it gives in to a lot of the old musical trappings. It loses points for lack of diverse representation and a somewhat lackluster outcome for the protagonist.\n\nDespite this, La La Land is the Christmas sweater you shun in front of your friends but slip into when no one's watching. It's a comfort and a guilty pleasure. It's a spectacle, and an escape - exactly what I desperately craved.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://narrativemuse.co/movies/la-la-land, and was written by Sarah Krieg.

It is a pure Hollywood love story that has been portrayed by two amazingly talented actors. \nThe movie circles around two options. Either choose love or choose dreams. At the end of the film you will surely understand what the two protagonists choose and why they chose it, again shown in a beautiful way. It takes influence from movies like \"Singing in the Rain\" and demonstrates some iconic scenes in a new modern way that makes you feel nostalgic about the classic one. It is so perfectly crafted, but what makes this movie unique from any other romantic movies is its ending. That ending. Not only does it deliver some extremely emotional scenes but it changes the whole idea you had for the film. \nAlso, in a musical the music needs to be stunning for it to be successful. For the first time in a movie, I have cried so loudly when hearing a song. This soundtrack gives you the feels. It is a masterpiece from song one until the very last song. \nThe film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be - an unashamedly romantic musical, infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling/Stone, wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle. Oh, and it's hilarious throughout too. A genuine achievement - must be one of the best films I've seen in a long while.\nCheers to the dreamers, the men and women behind the making of this musical classic masterpiece.",

            "content": "Music and Love; Clich\u00e9? Yes, But They Are Going to Engross Your Attention\n               In early 20 century, people thought jazz is the devil's music. Jazz is attractive, powerful and beautiful, which is going to grab your heart from the beginning and the end, so is La La Land. La La Land, released in 2016, directed by Damien Chazelle, is a beautiful love story with fantastic music and dancing, as known as a musical movie. If you are looking for a movie that is going to make you captivated, La La Land is the best movie for you.\n\n               Damien Chazelle is a famous director for music related movie. Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench, Grand Piano and Whiplash are his previous work before La La Land. Because Whiplash got numerous awards from Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role to Best Achievement in Film Editing, I thought La La Land will follow the same structure of story, such as talent, practice, passion, etc. However, La La Land is totally different style of a movie. Compared to previous movies, La La Land more focuses on plot. I want to say that Damien Chazelle's music related movies are the best no matter what structure he uses.\n\nLa La Land has everything that a successful movie requires, good story and acting. Mia and Sebastian had dreams, a jazz musician and an actor. They supported each other's dream. Love and dream, aren't they clich\u00e9? But clich\u00e9 works perfect with perfect music.\n\nAt a scene that Mia and Sebastian meet again at Seb's, a jazz bar Sebastian runs, Sebastian plays a song named epilogue and imagines the future, what if we were still together. They look each other before Mia leaves Seb's, and this scene has the best acting in this movie. Sebastian slowly smiles and Mia responds to it with smile, too. Ryan Gosling's gentle and subtle smile was so perfect that my heart started crying. They showed that they respect and support each other's present, which was used be just a dream, through their smiles. Isn't this beautiful? Amazing acting astonished me, but music in the movie also surprised me and let me enjoy whole movie.\n\n               La La Land has plot like a music. It starts with very strong, bright and impressive songs Another Day of Sun and Someone in the Crowd like an addictive intro of pop music. Dancing and colorful clothes of the actors do not allow you to be distracted. However, since Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is getting known each other better after the party, the movie tells people that the main story starts now. Songs, from A Lovely Night to Summer Montage, kept me focusing on the movie. Tap dancing by two main characters at A Lovely Night scene was also great as the song. The movie does not stop at a happy love story. City of Stars, Set A Fire, Engagement Party and Audition (The Fool Who Dream) show the main point of the movie, contradiction between dream and reality, Mia and Sebastian. Climax and resolution of the story is the future that Sebastian draws via Epilogue, the future if Mia and Sebastian would not break up. This well-made songs and plot are one of the best part of the movie.\n\n               If you want to watch a happy-ending movie, La La Land may not a movie you are looking for. But, if you are looking for well-made musical music, La La Land will give you unforgettable experience. A well written story directed by a music movie expert, great acting by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, fantastic songs from singing to background, and even lovely and romantic California where the movie is taken are not going to let you down.",

Damien Chazelle has given us a perfect blend of songs, colour, conflict and drama however Hurwitz and Moore are the real underlying heroes with a score that you listen to with both your ears and your hips. The film brilliantly captures the harsh realities of chasing your dreams and how destructive they can be for relationships.

She never gets parts, not because she sucks, but she is starting to give up on her ambitions. Then there's another huge name, Ryan Gosling is Sebastian. A pianist that takes rather crappy music jobs. He has plenty of dreams that involve real jazz, something that's dying if you ask him. They share a story. It starts of as separate parts, but they get involved in each others lifes very smoothly. The film for me is both simple and straight forward, throw in some songs and some moves and you got yourself a musical. Not the most typical musical, but there are at least six or seven scenes here done with songs.\n\nI liked it, even if it's not a complete treat.

After eons, we finally get to watch a perfect potboiler; a cracker of a love story; simply out of the world music; brilliant casting and finally a chance to listen to A-ha's Take on Me on screen. What more can we ask for?\n\nAs it turns out, we sure can ask for more. For instance, we can ask for the leading pair to the set the screen ablaze and they do better. Apart from setting our screen ablaze, they end up burning the reel of the movie they are watching. When their hands caress each other; the fingers play hide and seek and finally end up entwined, it is probably Fahrenheit 451. I can't say for sure for I was running for the door?-?I had to find a passage back to the place I was before.\n\n\"Relax\" said the girl with the cutest eyes I have ever seen on screen, perhaps off screen too, \"You can check out anytime you want. But you can never leave!\" So true, it's been an hour and thirty miles from where the show ended and I still look to my left and find the pair dancing as if there is no tomorrow amidst applause by the mighty skyline of Los Angeles.\n\nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone set the screen on fire. Their chemistry is so fundamental and native that you are convinced they are made and mad for each other. Fortunately, the director ensures they stop at quick kisses, for who knows how many fire tenders would have to be called had they gone a little beyond kissing!\n\nIt is what we call here a mass masala. It has all the ingredients in the right proportions served exactly at the right moment?-?not a second earlier and not a second later. It has drama, humour, emotion, heartbreak, you name it?-?it has it. And there's a method in this madness, a beautiful form that keeps all these elements in check allowing none to engulf the others.\n\nA perfect musical in the more than able hands of the two insanely talented young actors Gosling and Stone. There are a number of Birdmanish sequences in the movie where you wonder if the director got carried away in the sparkling romance brewing in front of him and forgot to say \"cut\" and the actors happily continued enjoying each other's presence. Pulling off such lengthy sequences is not a mean feat, mind you?-?especially when there is no CGI to bail you out.\n\nThe last fifteen minutes of the movie take it the next level completely. Not that the movie needed to be taken there. It was perfectly fine at the level it was playing. Still the climax, so brilliantly conceptualized and flawlessly executed?-?make it sort of a classic of classics. It is pure poetry. It has to be seen to be believed. No one can review this piece. It is God. You just sit there and submit yourself to it.\n\nIf you haven't watched it yet, you are probably incredibly fortunate. For, beware?-?Once you see it, there's no going back.

Damien Chazelle's La La Land is a modern day movie musical, that feels like a classic. After the Oscar winning Whiplash movie moviegoers were excited to see Damien Chazelle's next big movie. La La Land Stars Emma Stone, as an aspiring actress, and Ryan Gosling as an aspiring jazz pianist. It follows the two as they fall in love in a picturesque Las Angeles. Linus Sandgren, the cinematographer of the the film, captures beautiful images of  Los Angeles and blends color in to a scene that will jump of the scene. Sandgren even won an academy award for the film. The score for the film, written by Justin Hurwitz captures their budding romance in an inspirational way, adding to the scene. There are some scenes with just score where you can fully tale in the magic of it. Ryan Gosling's Sebastian wants to achieve his dreams while simultaneously helping Mia, Emma Stone's character, achieve her's. This is a film that when you leave it will want to go to Hollywood and be part of the magic that is movies. This is when movies become film. This is why movies are necessary.",

            "content": "Singing and dancing its way into the hearts, minds, and ears of even those who think that Chicago was a complete waste of time, elegant, enchanting, edgy and elegiac tune-up La La Land often looks like an homage to Golden Age H'Wood but sports enough lovestruck spark and - alternately - jaded spunk to qualify it as a true modern-day genre original. \n\nIn this PG-13-rated musical, a pianist (Ryan Gosling) and an actress (Emma Stone) fall in love while attempting to reconcile their aspirations for the future amid navigating their divergent careers in Los Angeles. Don't call it a throwback. Indeed, La La Land lovingly tips its hat to such entertainment industry-set musicals as Singin' in the Rain and New York, New York but also charts a millennial-appropriate melancholic course all its own. While some great musicals like All that Jazz get downright bleak, La La Land softshoes into the dark without every fully losing its color and buoyancy. Take for instance a date night rendezvous shot in the Griffith Observatory, which literally sees the leads taking flight and dancing among the stars. This could very easily have gotten so on-the-nose schmaltzy that the scene required an animated Disney sidekick. Instead, the entire song-and-dance - we're taking the film as a whole - knowingly keeps it from tripping over its own feet into a brink called cornball. It knows what it is. It's a dessert and a floor wax...er, rather, it's nostalgic, romantic, and also terminally cynical all at once while dancing backward in high heels. If that doesn't speak to many of today's workaday Americans, then the musical is not only merely dead, it's really most sincerely dead.  \n\nUltimately, La La Land is a hat-trick...albeit a very accomplished hat-trick. To remain vital in that gnat's-attention-span known as modern pop culture, a musical must implant one key feature into the brain of filmgoers: a hummable tune. Just as a western must present at least one key scene set in or that strongly brings to mind the untamed mythic expanse known as the American West, a musical has to boast at least one notable song. La La Land accomplishes this. Oh, \"City of Stars\" won't ultimately achieve the classic status of, say, \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" from The Wizard of Oz, but definitely qualifies as toe-tapping and memorable. \"Another Day of Sun\" proves less of an earworm but backs the film's showstopper moment--a one-take, traffic-snarled freeway song-and-dance number. That this showstopper kicks off the film and a blue note ends it while still making the audience beam from ear to ear speaks to the brilliance of director Damian Chazelle. Neither a jukebox musical nor a Broadway adaptation, his La La Land is a rare beast thought extinct. Building upon his short musical Guy And Madeline On A Park Bench (perhaps a bit too much as the film's only failing is that it runs too long) with a cornucopia and cacophony perfectly suited for the here and now, his musical is original in the best sense. In fact, his hat-trick greatly one-ups 2011 Best Picture Oscar winner The Artist, which was a silent film homage accomplished through shear imitation. La La Land harks back without becoming its forebears--a love letter and a Dear John letter in one fell swoop. Chazelle shares this dignity not just with the genius-level choreographers and songwriters, but mostly with Gosling and Stone who pull all off the whole act with a ridiculous amount of grace and conviction. An impeccable latter-day Vaudeville team, their singing and dancing aren't perfect but you wouldn't want them polished to that vaunted degree. They're relatable...well, at least as relatable as people who break into song on a moment's notice. Working beautifully together, step for gorgeous step and note for lovely note, they provide the heart and soul to a film whose target demo are people with hearts and souls. \n\nTo Sum It All Up: City of Starstruck",

But soon within minutes becomes the crowd pleasing, tone setting opening number of musical glee. \n\n\nSelf aware and contemporary the camera glides through the scene in seemingly well choreographed Steadicam shot.\n\n\n Here we meet Emma Stone's struggling actress, to Ryan Gosling's struggling Musician both living in LA but both not living the dream - as one would have hoped. Eventually after the standard Rom/Com beats are walked through - Love is to blossom - but ironically only when it does there seems to be somewhat weakness in the story.\n\n\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tension in the story erupts from the unemployed Gosling taking advice from Stone and getting a \"real\" job. Here his first \"real\" job happens to be a lead member of a overnight successful band and he travels the country making tons of money using his natural musical talents - sure beats working 50hrs a week at McDonald's.\n\n\nOn the flip side of this seemingly awful \"Hell\", Stone quits her day job of serving coffee on the Warner Brothers lot to become a full time unemployed play wright - clearly not taking her own advice. \n\n\n\nAnd when that \"horrible\" bread winning boyfriend then takes time out of his hectic schedule to travel back across the country just to surprise his Girlfriend and cook her dinner, how fitting they have their first big row.\n\n\nHe is pulled to task on not playing the type of music he loves, instead he advised he should quit and to continue on his ambition of starting his own jazz club with no money and no savings.  At this point it looks like Stone's Character is truly living in \"LA LA Land\" indeed. \n\n\n Later the tables are turned and she becomes a successful actor with Gosling supporting her totally making the sacrificing pledge that they should split so she could concentrate totally on her opportunity. A supportive partner indeed with Stone replying she will always love him. Cut to five years later when she's a Hollywood superstar, married someone to else and had their baby - Romeo and Juliet indeed this is not. \n\n\nThe ending seems rushed and somewhat deluded in order to  comply with a clever idea of a third dream but in orchestrating in this manner to me doesn't ring true to character of Stone or what we've just spent two hours setting up.\n\n\nBut hey this is a musical! Sure it's running time is a little to generous for a somewhat uncomplicated story but this film is made form start to finish with bucket loads of passion from every department. \n\n\n The Director takes this genre and wears his heart in his sleeve sucking in some beautiful natural lighting, sunsets and set pieces celebrating L.A natural charm. \n\n\nTalking of charm the lead actors have plenty - oozing it from the screen and thoroughly enjoying any opportunity to sing and dance the genre to pride. \nThis film is escapism and as long as you take yourself to \"La La Land\" in the first place, you will surely have a nice enjoyable time in this nostalgic wink to classic Hollywood and contemporary L.A.",

I literally cannot remember a single one as the Jazz genre this promoted just didn't promote that uplifting feel good vibe. The story was understandable but weak, following the lives of two aspiring talents, one in music, and one in film. Both keen to follow their hearts to get to where they dream of being, regardless of the knock backs they receive along the way. Frankly i was bored and even the simple story began to lose me towards the end, as we witnessed confusing scenes of what could have been as well as what actually occurred. This is not what I would have expected from a highly acclaimed musical, and certainly not what I would have wanted. I'm pleased it pleased so many other audiences out there but I can assure you its success will never cease to astound me.",

Every emotion that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone convey with their eyes, Damien Chazelle with his wonderful vision of this story, Justin Hurwitz with every single note of his catchy and touching songs. It's one of those films which might not necessarily have one of the most complicated plots, but it takes you on an emotional journey which will make you both laugh and cry.

I expected more from professional dancers, and the numbers with Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are even more disappointing. \"La La Land\" is clearly trying to recapture some of the magic from old Hollywood, but if you were to compare some of the incredible tap numbers of the past to the little number Stone and Gosling did while overlooking L.A., it simply falls flat.\n\nThe singing was also not quite up to snuff, ranging from \"not good\" to \"okay\". The songs were, regrettably, very forgettable.\n\nEmma Stone is a darling, and her quirkiness is always much appreciated. Ryan Gosling's character was also had his quirks, but he came of as weird and not charming. Stone also out-acted Gosling. Watch the emotional range on her face during the dinner fight argument and compare it to Gosling. \n\nOn top of the musical aspect of the film being a disappointment, it's quite boring.

He's named it after her, and also found a new location to set up shop.\n\nThe ending is one of the most bittersweet moments. Where he's let her go to wait for her to come back. \n\nBut when she finally does, she's moved on and had settled already.\n\nThat's when the ending scene of the \"big what if\", if he had gone with her, and what that path in life would have been.\n\nBut sadly, that's a path not happening in this timeline, but in a parallel timeline.

Instead, Chazelle plays within the rules of the genre (in which characters can break into song and dance at any given moment) and this has led to some accusations of sexism because the relationship between Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) does evoke 1950s traditional gender roles (and expectations) despite the fact that the leads' efforts toward developing careers in the entertainment industry (jazz pianist and actor, respectively) are given relatively equal attention.  Although the film opens audaciously with a big number on a highway overpass with a large cast of dancers and then quickly shows us a color-coded sequence featuring Emma Stone and her roommates, things then calm down a bit as Stone and Gosling begin their romance.  That's not to say that Chazelle doesn't have a great emotional touch or that his script doesn't continually hit the right buttons for an homage of this sort, it just doesn't stay at that high level of surprise/stunningness (nor should it, if the movie is to follow screenwriting 101 norms, which it does).  Gosling is fine, rather subdued and perhaps not much of a singer/dancer (though he taught himself piano for the role) but Stone is very charismatic (if somewhat unusual looking with such large eyes) and together they manage to make their relationship seem real enough with a trajectory that is more-or-less believable.  I say \"more-or-less\" because in a musical such as this, realism isn't really necessary, nor even expected; Chazelle gives into the fantasy elements of his script but has the wisdom to underscore the implausibility with the same sort of sadness that you find in Demy's Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964).  Again, the thrills found here are not a result of anything new but just a fine example of a master craftsman using the best materials to recreate something that was well-loved from the past (albeit with a new script, songs, and players).",

            "content": "LaLa Land-Dream Chasing is Not For the Weak\n\nBecause Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are quite the duo, they are a perfect choice for the two leading co-stars in Damien Chazelle's film La La Land. This wonderfully clever film plays on their talents and intertwines the stories of two very determined dreamers showing the true dilemma that dream-chasing can bring.\n\nConnected by more than just mediocre musical talent, the two stars dance, sing and wittily bounce off each other in a magical way, showing the joys and heart aches of two dreamers working oh-so hard to pursue their own ambitions while encouraging the other to do the same. Gosling plays Sebastian, an aspiring piano player who wishes to one day own a Jazz Club. He crosses paths with Stone's character Mia, an ambitious actress who despite her best efforts, just can't seem to land a role and is stuck being a barista at a coffee shop. The two, at first, don't seem to get along, displayed in a couple different scenes where their interactions are not so pleasant. When they finally come face-to-face enough to actually talk to one another, they flirtatiously banter and sing a very provoking duet while dancing, before there are any noticeable feelings between the two. Soon after getting more acquainted with each other, Mia and Sebastian are drawn together by their similar drive for their dreams. Their very distinctive dreams. The couple's wonderful chemistry can't seem to keep them together as they are both trying to follow their dreams, realizing that as they are both working to fulfill their individual dreams, they are inevitably getting torn apart. The ending scene shows the two characters with their very separate lives in their very separate dreams, fulfilled and satisfied.\n\nI think that one of the things that drives home the predicament between love and ambition is the sheer chemistry between the main characters. We've seen Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling previously work marvelously together in Crazy, Stupid, Love and know that they are two very lovable actors. I would say they are even more lovable when they're in love with each other. The film does a wonderful way of playing off of each actor's strengths, with Gosling's doting charm and Stones adorable sense of humor, giving the on-screen pair a perfect, not over-bearing, amount of spark. That amazing amount of chemistry between the two is what makes the ending of the movie especially hard for me. I dare anyone to say \"I hope that those two(might I add, perfect people) don't end up with each other at the end of this all!\" So, it kills me that they don't actually end up with one another. Who could see that coming? I can't say that I wouldn't have rather have had the two together, with each other, happy at the end. What makes the ending even more difficult is that a heart-wrenching scene plays the \"what could have been\" between the couple showing how happy their life together could have been. Regardless, it is clear to see why they couldn't be together. There was not a way for them to both to fulfill their separate dreams without sacrificing their relationship. But who cares? Mia and Sebastian are soulmates and as we see from that scene showing their alternate lives, the couple could have been so happy in their life together! Not to say that they are not happy in their dream lives-the last scene shows that they most definitely are, but it certainly makes me happier having them together. It goes to show that sacrifices have to be made in life to fulfill ones dream's, however painful the sacrifice may be. It also shows that happiness and satisfaction can be found in many different paths of life. \n\nThat central idea of chasing after dreams and the things that need to be given up in order to do so, is so original and I love that! This film does a splendid job at really showing both the joys and pains of dream chasing. The whole movie I was wondering, which character, if either, would be able to attain their ambitions and what they would need to forgo in order to remain together. You see as the classic romantic storyline goes, things are always sacrificed for love, not the other way around. In some cases, the dream and the love are found together. One example of this is found in one of Stone's previous films-The Amazing Spider-Man, where Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) gets to live out his life as a superhero and gets the girl(Stone), showing both love and ambition being obtained. This film, however, chooses to sacrifice the unspeakable: love. The fact that love is given up in the end is a major plot twist and makes this film very distinct. Yeah, maybe I knew that Sebastian and Mia would fall in love, but I never would have guessed how their lives would play out to be so detached. Although notably appreciative for the life together they forsook, in the end, both characters were content in living the life they had worked so diligently for and I can't be upset about that.\n\nAll in all, I think that La La Land relays a wonderful message, in a clever way, with amazing actors. We truly get a unique take on the risk of pursuing dreams. Everything from Stone's and Gosling's natural chemistry, to their drive for their ambitions, to them taking a stab at a musical with less-than perfect singing and dancing endeared me to them and their situations and made me love this movie.

I guess the story of \"poor me\", I moved to Hollywood and I'm a struggling artist really hits home with Hollywood.  But in all reality \"Who Cares\" about an actor's struggle to crack into the business.  Emma Stone winning best actress is such a joke.  Ryan Gosling was pretty good and outshines Emma Stone, not sure what the Academy was thinking here.  As I right this short review, I find my self getting even more mad at this movie.

            "content": "From the moment the film begins you know what kind of experience you're in for. From the bright colours, to the music and the big choreographed dance number, this film harkens back to old, Hollywood musicals. Mia, a typical aspiring young actor who works in a coffee shop, and Sebastian, a down on his luck jazz pianist, are struggling to get by in a competitive modern LA and are drawn together by their desire to follow their dreams. \nBoth Emma Stone, as Mia, and Ryan Gosling, as Sebastian, carry this film very well but Emma Stone in particular is very magnetic and gives a powerful performance as her character struggles to achieve her goals and choose between love and her dreams. Sebastian on the other hand is far less interesting and could have done with more character development but Stone and Gosling have such good chemistry together that their romance is very believable. Both actors also have quite nice singing voices but the songs are largely forgettable save for one or two of the bigger numbers. \nThe plot is fairly predictable and the film starts to drag a bit towards the end but it's still enjoyable to watch and I particularly liked the direction they went with the ending.The tap dancing number is also a nice homage to musicals like singing in the rain and iconic performances by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers but Stone and Gosling can't hold a candle to that level of skill at tap dancing.\nThe cinematography is good and very nostalgic of old Hollywood and uses light and colour well to accentuate the mood of different scenes and moments. There are also many long tracking shots, without cuts, of musical numbers and dances that are very well choreographed, performed and flow seamlessly. However some of the camera work is a little manic and the amount of spinning in some scenes is a bit nauseating and overdone. \nOverall, although it's a shame the songs aren't catchier, it's an enjoyable musical and a love letter to LA that I think most people will enjoy.",

            "content": "I've never been a fan of the musical or romantic genre in general, but with it's energetic tone, powerful performances, relative themes and Damien Chazelle's assured direction, La La Land captured my attention in a way few films of this caliber ever could. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are perfect in the lead roles and its all mostly down to their performances, injecting plenty of character and personality into their roles along with their natural chemistry. Both of their characters also benefit from the amount of depth that the well written script demands of them, making their characters well rounded and intensely relatable. Emma Stone, in particular is very captivating, her character's turmoils are conveyed through Stone's layered performance. It's down to them that throughout the film you care so much for the two. La La Land tells a heartwarming tale of love, sacrifice and our fantasies, and balances its dramatic elements perfectly against the musical and romantic tone it also has. It tells the timeless story of a pair who must decide either to advance on their relationship at the cost of their dreams or follow their path, and while the film is rightfully full of energy and crowd pleasing, it doesn't shy away from the cruelty underneath either. During the middle act, the film hits a bit of a sludge, not that its too bad, but the transition is very noticeable after the onslaught of music that came before, before picking back up for the grand finale. All capped off with an all too true ending that is as memorable as they come. Damien Chazelle once again delivers, after his film Whiplash, with a timeless, old school feel that proves that these kinds of films still work today, in his craft, blending together themes of romance, drama and plenty of assured heart while exploring the age-old conflict of ambition vs love with a rare sense of pursuance relative to most other films like this. The film is filled with plenty of memorable music scores, from the energetic open in sequence to the more slow-paced, and thoughtful \"City of Stars\" although it does taper off a not during its middle act in order to develop it's characters. The camera editing between these sequences is sharp and gives the film a brisk feel as they alternate between different segments in a seamless fashion. Above all else, the film is undeniably gorgeous to look at, the cinematography paints the film in beautiful shades of blue, red, and the occasional green that makes it that much harder to look at. For a musical film, and much less, a romantic one, La La Land quickly embraces my attention like none before. -",

I have to say, that the musical movies aren't exactly my favourite ones, since I hate when they sing during a movie - I see it like \"Hey, look at me, I can sing and I'm making you losing useful time for the plot\", but I however decided to watch it, just because I was told it was unlosable. Actually, this is precisely the kind of movie you can't miss, because, well or badly, it will make people talk about itself for ages. So, I've been to the cinema for it, and I can eventually say that I find this movie terribly awful. I've never felt my money and time more wasted than having watched this movie in a cinema. \nWhat I don't appreciate in this movie is not the technical part. The director's, director of photography's, sound technicians', scene makers' and other workers' job is very fine. The problems stay in the rest: the story, the sense of some scenes, the music... I was covered by expectations, this movie should have given me an experience beyond good and bad, making me cry... I've cried two times in 12 years, due to not-physical-pain-related motivations, so, as you can imagine, it's very difficult to make me show my emotions in a very clear way. However, this movie, according to all the expectation I was given, should have provoked this kind of reaction in me. But, instead, NO, t didn't! I was very annoyed by the presumption of this movie, which tries to destroy the world with its exceptionally bright colours and musics, trying to be original at every cost; according to me, instead, it miserably fails. There are especially three points that make me quite upset.\nFirst of all, the love story. It's just the usual, normal, obvious love story with the cool guy and the cool girl (I don't know how \"cool\" this girl is, actually... Emma Stone is a very nice girl, but her face seems to make her cry every time she is focused with the camera, but, however, let's go on), they meet up, but eventually they break up because he doesn't care for her, her projects sink, he lets his dream go just for money... in the end she's happy with someone else, and they meet up, quite embarrassed, again and they just say \"We'll love each other forever\" (big lie, since you have married another guy, and you don't seem unhappy together with him, but maybe I can't just read the fadings in uman feelings...). Maybe I don't believe in love, but it can't be possible that you fall in love for someone just listening him playing. I've tried this on myself, and no. IT - DOESN'T - WORK - THIS - WAY. Gotcha? Ok, let's go on.\nSecondly, the music: a musical with bad music is died at its very beginning. Songs are bright, coloured, but tremendously common. Where are the good old times of Ennio Morricone, and similars? If I think of the fact that the Academy Award for the best song was given to \"City of stars\", which is just a G-7 chord, repeated for about 4 minutes, my blood boils... is everything really here? You seriously gave the most important award for a cinema song to this? It's another sympthom of the fact that musical feeling of the audience dropped like a waterfall... Seriously, it's ununderstandable.\nLast, but not least, the ending scene. I've never felt this useless watching a movie scene. It's as like as they told you \"Oh, wow, you reached this point, and the movie could end here... but I'd like to show you what could have happened. [scene] Hey, you liked it? Me too, but unfortunately, this hasn't happened, your protagonists will live happy forever with their lives, and I needed to make the movie longer, because the productor wouldn't give me enough money to make this movie be called a 'kolossal', you know...\". The final scene is precisely the representation of what happened during the Academy Awards Ceremony: \"Hey, your movie could have been the best, but, unfortunately, there is another one which we must give this little statue to, for a mere practical/political reason\". \nSynthetizing my thought in few words: this movie is a poo sign in cinema's underpants. I had really liked to appreciate it, but unfortunately, I couldn't do it anyway, nothing has been able to convince me that this movie is nothing but a terribly boring sequence of songs and love moments, and some scenes somewhere are quite forced - it's very good for the scene that Mia has a pair of man ball shoes in her pocket, just because Sebastian needed them and the plot requested it... very normal, I must say... -. The only thing I did appreciate was the speech about jazz music pronounced by Sebastian at a certain point, but stop. Everything else, in the not-technical field, doesn't work. Bad experience, mainly due to the huge expectations I had, totally unfulfilled, which makes my judgement much more worse. This is just a normal movie, but it's been unexplainably worshipped by the criticians and the audience. If you can, avoid this.",

Even that movie was as surprising as La La Land. If you don't like Jazz and broadway stuff then you can forget it and move on. But if you like quirky yet face the music stuff like La La Land then stay and enjoy the story because Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone did an outstanding performance. The one intense song called \"Someone in the Crowd\" is still playing in my head as I type this and it gives me an inspiring feel. Makes me want to chase my dreams, if you will. The story is so typical but it's so good because it's a good reminder that even if you can't, you can and just do it.

Obviously it has gotten all the praise it got for a reason - and I don't disagree with all the reviews, this movie has a lot to offer for all types of people. There is obviously the romance between Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone), and the chemistry between the two was extremely strong throughout the movie, so much so actually that it legitimately tore me to shreds by the end of the movie, and in no way whatsoever am I that emotional of a person, especially with movies. But this one was something different, by the end, I felt for both of the characters, and the ending was done in a way that I'm not afraid to say brought me to actual tears. The musical part of this movie was also a huge plus, both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have pleasant vocals, and the jazz themed music was also really well done. However, although there has been an insane amount of praise for this movie, there is a specific target audience, and I don't really think I fit into that target category. I did say that this movie is good no matter who you are, but if you're someone who isn't really into romantic musicals, then the first half of this movie might seem a little slow, which was a little bit the case for me. By the end however, it really picked up, and like I said, sent me through a whirlwind of emotions, which again is pretty uncommon for me. In the end, \"La La Land\" deserves most of the praise that it gets, and if you are interested in the premise of this movie, then you will definitely enjoy it, however if it doesn't interest you and you just want to check it out because of the reviews, don't get your hopes up too high. Nonetheless, \"La La Land\" is definitely worth watching.",

While not as poised as professional Broadway stars may be, the authenticity is there and gives it the \"special something\" it needs. I am particularly fond of all the song and dance sequences, especially the epilogue, because it just has the magic that Hollywood once cultivated so readily but now has largely forgotten.

It's a beautiful film in more ways than one, with gorgeous visuals and cinematography, great camerawork, and inspired writing/directing from Chazelle, giving off that rare magic that is so very difficult to transmit - it feels nostalgic and speaks to something deep within the soul. Gosling and Stone deliver outstanding and often times hilarious performances with the chemistry between them being absolutely electric; their musical pieces feel genuine because they are not loud, brash numbers that feel like they've been professionally produced, nor are they quite pitch perfect all of the time. Of course, the soundtrack is genius: heartfelt, authentic and sincere, tying everything together. I don't know that that this is what you'd call a 'crowd pleaser' -- it may be just be too artsy for that -- but it is a special kind of film and I can't believe that there won't be a lot of people who will feel the sparks. It's for the ones who dream, foolish as they may seem; for the romantics and the creatives. Absolutely memorable.",

The two main characters both have dreams they are trying to follow in a city where everyone has the same exact dreams as them. Their struggles are relatable and their love is realistic. With overly romantic parts and heart-wrenching heart breaks, this movie has it all. The musical part of the movie is pretty forgettable and seems to be only a secondary theme. However, it does blend nicely with the story and is a nice backdrop to the story. The ending is, in a way, sad, but also satisfying in a sort of way. Overall, this movie is perfect for a \"girls night-in\" type of night and will leave the watcher happy.",

This time, we visited again the love story of Mia () and Seb (Ryan Gosling), like the first viewing we experience the love story for the first half and expect a classic Hollywood happy ending. When the audience feel comfortable with the story, it will hit you with a realistic scenario between two lovers. People could blame either of them for the failings of their relationship, but with a more objective eye. It's just two people at the right time at the right place couldn't bring their relationship into fruition because of the ensync of their life. If they stayed together they could both drag each others down, it's true love to let them go and find their passion. Seb for the first time out his way to make Mia happy and end up with their first argument. Mia on the other hand follow her passion and became successful. It's a tragic story if you expect an classic romantic happy ending but it's an happy ending for people who experience love in real life when people rarely being together at the same time to became a true long loving relationship. A lesson here is there is no lesson just life as the way it's. At the end, a smile to acknowledge between two past lovers to know true love is to happy for what they are. \n",

However, these things were all smoke and mirrors to me, to hide the fact that the story was shallow and pretentious. It just wasn't all that interesting and couldn't hold my attention. The characters were annoying as hell; Gosling's character is essentially a Jazz snob (why are they all like that?) and Stone was plain whiney.  Also, neither of them can sing or dance, so that kinda ruined the whole show.  Is it just me or do Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling just seem to play the same people in every one of their movies? I feel like they're the same no matter what roles they play (it's the same with Ryan Reynolds) as though their acting spectrum is very limited so they can't take on a wide variety of diverse roles. In a nutshell: beautifully made and visually striking, but rather uninteresting story and uninspired acting. Totally not deserving of all the Oscars.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Well Scott, are you Ga Ga over La La Land?\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) La La Land was definitely not doo doo and much better than so so. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to bright and emerging actress Mia (Emma Stone). She is trying out for a number of movies and has big dreams of becoming a movie star. But first she must work in the movie studio s coffee shop as a barista. She goes to a restaurant at Christmastime where she hears a young Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) playing a piano. Things aren t going so well for young Sebastian as he is summarily fired for not playing holiday standards.\n\nSCOTT: Mia and Sebastian s paths keep crossing. Eventually they go out, enjoy great chemistry together, and fall in love. Sebastian meets an old friend and bandmate who invites Sebastian to join his band. The offer is lucrative, and Sebastian accepts but is dismayed to discover that the band s music is uninteresting and a total sell-out. Meanwhile, Mia s one-woman play is a total bust, sending Mia home to live with her parents in Nevada.\n\nGREG: The opening scene of La La Land is a massive production number where all the (young) drivers in Los Angeles  gridlock get out of their cars and sing and dance. This is a promise that we re in for a classic musical ala the 1940 s. But it is a promise that will soon be broken as the leads in this story really don t sing or dance very much. And when they do it is the minimum necessary. La La Land is a huge disappointment. It wouldn t have been so bad if that were the only flaw. But this movie fails on every level. Musical: the songs are abandoned at about the 25% point. Dance: Stone and Gosling barely perform - I ve seen better work on TV s Dancing with the stars. Plot: This is a hackneyed story that has little depth. Jazz: Gosling s thing is that he wants everyone to love Jazz. And by the end of the story we don t care one wit about Jazz. It s a story full of promises that are never delivered upon.\n\nSCOTT: I disagree, Greg. Yes, La La Land is lightweight fun but it is fun nonetheless. The film is packed with visual and emotional appeal. At the visual level, we are treated to delightful cinematography capturing the spirit of the southern California lifestyle and the glamor of the entertainment industry. At an emotional level, we fall in love with the idea of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling falling in love. There is a palpable spark between them, made more poignant by their professional struggles. The heroes of the story are the romantic duo of Mia and Sebastian. We can tell they are destined to fall in love because they dislike each other at the outset. La La Land is clever in its introduction to our heroes. There is a minor road rage incident, a snub at a nightclub, and an annoying party song request. Each hero hits a low point; his is at the beginning, hers is toward the end. There are no villains, other than the difficult entertainment industry in which they work. The journey consists of them helping each other succeed, and the adventurous storyline exudes fun, energy, wit, and charm.\n\nGREG: I had no problem with these characters as the leads - except that there was nothing particularly interesting about them. Gosling did a good job as the jazz pianist - apparently playing the piano himself in scenes that required it. Aside from one scene where he explains jazz to Mia, we don t really get to see his passion. And when Mia encourages him to try out for a band, he resists at first, then joins up. Apparently he had personality conflicts with the leader (played by John Legend). But we never really see these conflicts. And our hero seems to genuinely enjoy playing the  new jazz.  So it s a bit of a surprise when he claims he only joined because Mia exhorted him to. Likewise with Mia s talents. Sebastian encourages Mia to stop auditioning and work on her one-woman show. Which she does and when only a handful of people show up, she decides to quit acting altogether. But then a casting agent saw the show and wants to cast Mia in a major feature. And we have the same problem again - we never saw the one-woman show. So we have no idea whether she was any good in it. The only real example of Mia s acting we get is a monologue where she reminisces about an aunt who got a passing mention in an earlier scene. It s truly a touching moment - possibly the only one in the film. So I m pretty unenthusiastic about this romantic hero pairing. There s a lot of talk about their relative passions, but very little of it is on-screen. We just have to take their word for it. So I ll go back to the old saw about writing -  show, don t tell. \n\nSCOTT: They showed plenty to me. Sebastian s passion for jazz jumped off the screen for me, and inspired me (a disliker of jazz) to actually enjoy the music I heard in this movie. It was all  show  and very little  tell . And thank God they didn t show Mia s one-woman show; what a waste that would have been. We witnessed her talent big-time during her failed auditions, where she was jinxed time and again. This year we ve explored the important role of mentoring in the movies, and this movie could serve as an example of a story that works just fine without mentoring. The reason is that our two heroes help each other transform -- a type of peer assisted transformation. Mia helps Sebastian learn to follow his dream, a conceptual transformation for him. In turn, he helps her by getting her to the movie audition -- a mechanical transformation. That s more black-and-white than it really is, but the point is that any mentoring they received happened earlier in their lives, with Sebastian getting great keyboard training and Mia some impressive acting lessons.\n\nGREG: Once again, as with so much in this film, the mentoring is off-camera. There was so much that was off-camera in this film I felt that I didn t really need to be in the theater. La La Land is a film that promised much and delivered little. Even it s opening scrawl promised it would be a Cinemascope classic. But it pales in comparison to such classics as Singin  in the Rain and Top Hat. Those films, even with their limited plotlines, delivered amazing songs and dance routines.  I ve watched theatrical musicals. I met theatrical movies. Theatrical movies have been friends of mine. La La Land - you re no theatrical musical!  I give La La Land just 2 out of 5 Reels. The heroes in this film are flimsy and uninteresting. They scarcely have an arc that I could detect. The one saving grace is the last scene which was a  what could have been  montage. That was a welcome diversion from an otherwise ho-hum hero s journey. I give the heroes in this film just 2 out of 5 Heroes. And the mentoring was non-existent save for the owner of Mia s coffee shop. 1 Mentor for her. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: La La Land is a spirited visual and musical spectacle that will keep your toes tapping and your heart singing long after you leave the theater. Ryan Gosling and Emma stone enjoy a sizzling romance that struggles to bloom and then lights up the big screen. I fell in love with the idea of them falling in love, and I wasn t disappointed at all by the clever, realistic ending that showed them in different places yet forever changed by each other. La La Land falls just shy of earning all 5 points but does merit a festive 4 Reels out of 5. Our two star-crossed lovers win our hearts with their sweet intentions, winning dispositions, and boundless talent. Ryan Gosling always amazes me by portraying characters whom I shouldn t like but nevertheless find myself rooting for. Emma Stone remains one of the most mega-talented actors in Hollywood, and together these two stars make magic in the theater. Their hero s journeys are textbook and I enjoyed watching them help each other transform into entertainers who achieve their full potential. They easily earn 4 Hero points out of 5. There is no mentoring per se in this movie, at least not on-screen, but this is a film that doesn t require mentoring to be effective. So no worries at all (from me) in assigning 1 single measly Mentor point out of 5. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:",

I would love to say that this was a good stab at bringing back the Hollywood musicals, but in all honesty I can't.  The great musical movie performers who are watching from above were probably either laughing at the attempt or crying because it was so wrong.  Ryan Gosling I think was the problem, he seemed totally not into the role.  He was just walking through the script, no emotion at all.

The film opened with a song that I was not happy, because I did not like the verse or the music. And again to say, the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme, unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film. \n\nThe best part of the film was, those song fades away as the film progresses. But I kind of liked the drama/story part and the climax track with the quick flashback (kind of). Till that scene I was considering it an average film, but that one scene changed my stance. So, now I think it is a good film, but winning 6 Oscars, I don't know it deserved that.\n\nYes, the director is known for making music and musical film, but he has not made many. He's young and so his career. Yep, I loved 'Whiplash'. One of my all time favourite. If that film had won 10 Oscars, I would have not surprised at all. After that flick, the people were anticipating, to exceed that success in this film. As it was received, no doubt for those people it was a different flick, but not for me. Especially if you watch lots of Indian films. By the way the film characters were nice, and so the story, but not the songs.\n\nGosling and Stone were performed well. The chemistry between them was great. The narration was going decently until the end, which reminded me 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya' ending that I was not happy about, yet something different than usual. Sometimes I am okay with clich\u00e9 than this kind of conclusion, just to bring a change in storytelling. Overall an enjoyable film, most people would love it. Some like me would say it is a decent flick, but there's always a few who would never favour it. Yet worth a watch.\n\n7/10",

However my girlfriend absolutely wanted to watch it so I got it. As it turned out my girlfriend had only gone by the number of Oscars and not really looked up what kind of movie it actually was so in the end I was enjoying the movie a lot more than she did.\n\nThis movie is pretty much a quite classical Hollywood musical with a non too original story, nice music and dancing. In addition the cinematography  is simply excellent. This is the strong point of this movie. The rest of the movie is of lesser interest to me but the cinematography is really, really good. The scene, pictured on the movie poster, were Mia and Sebastian dances and everything in the scene are dark blue tones except Mia's bright yellow dress is so simple and yet so beautiful.\n\nEverything else about this movie is...okay. Okay acting, okay story etc.  As I wrote before this is really not my kind of movie so forgive me for not being overly enthusiastic. I am sure those into these kind of movies cannot understand how anyone can give it less than a full set of stars but hey, different tastes and all that.\n\nI cannot make up my mind about ending. On one hand I am a sucker for happy endings which this one falls a wee bit short on. On the other hand I have to commend the writer/director for not taking the path of least resistance and instead putting together something a wee bit different.\n\nI did feel that a part of the movie was missing though. I would have liked to see the parts where Mia and Sebastian actually fulfilled their respective dreams. Jumping fast forward to the ending like the movie did felt a bit like they either ran out of money or they manage to misplace half the story!\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would.",

            "content": "Strengths: Benj Pasek and Justin Paul are the best names in songwriting and composing for a reason. A musical simply has to have great music. It sounds simple, but can\u00e2(TM)t be overlooked. The songs written for this are almost all great. They advance the story logically, are catchy, and masterfully executed. The pairing of Ryan Gosling (Sebastian Wilder) and Emma Stone (Mia Dolan) once again delivered. Their chemistry is unmatched in Hollywood right now. Each scene together is well acted and both sing way better than you\u00e2(TM)d probably expect. Damien Chazelle wrote this movie years before it came out because studios wanted to change his vision. Waiting was the best route to go, because this got made in his vision and was gorgeous. The backdrops and landscapes looked incredible. Chazelle made sure to provide us with a ton of beautiful shots to showcase this. The script is wonderful and provides us with fully fleshed out characters who grow over the course of the film. I really like how the movie avoids the clich\u00c3 (C)d ending and gives us something different. The characters don\u00e2(TM)t have to end up together for the story to work and this proves that. The movie also nails all the little moments throughout that make it special. \n\nWeaknesses: This could\u00e2(TM)ve used another song or two. Think about The Greatest Showman. It is packed with fantastic musical numbers and I think this could\u00e2(TM)ve benefitted from at least one more. There are a few pacing issues, causing the film to feel like it drags a bit at certain points.\n\nOverall: A gorgeous movie driven by top notch direction, tremendous acting, likable characters, and catch tunes. This should\u00e2(TM)ve won Best Picture.",

There are regular superhero movies where you feast your eyes upon the visual effects, there are generic animated movies with the critically acclaimed ones being the 2 cartoons from Disney and an amazing animated flick that no one saw, there are the average actioners, thought-provoking dramas, etc. La La Land provides a fresh change of pace by offering a pleasantly retro feel with the visual style, sets, shout-out to films released in the 40's and 50's among them Casablanca and Rebel Without a Cause and even the score. Which is odd yet fresh since the film takes place in the present day. The score and musical numbers are amazing. I'll probably be listening to the soundtrack tons of times on YouTube until all of them entirely invade my head. Personally, my favourite one is City of Stars. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have great chemistry together with the film having tons of charm. Seeing Gosling defending jazz in one scene proves just how, like many people who go to work in Los Angeles, determined he is in what he does. Even if you have no interest in films such as The Sound of Music and My Fair Lady, this film's soundtrack is enough to make this film worth watching as it serves as a proud throwback to the old Technicolor musicals from the early 20th century. La La Land is a wonderful treat that becomes unexpectedly heartbreaking by the third act and provides a fresh change of pace from all the big blockbusters Hollywood dishes out nowadays. *awkward silence accompanied by crickets chirping* What, were you expecting a witty La La Land/Moonlight joke? Sorry, nothing to see here, folks.",

Unforgetable and heart wrenching with a musical scores that dwellled long long after the film..  Incredible performance by Ryan and Emma with singing, dancing and musical skills so authentic. La la land is as magical and thrilling as all the hype and excitement suggested. Since I don't go to the cinema anymore, its a six months wait from screening to receiving my Bluray. It was worth the wait to watch it privately on 4K 65\" TV to avoid annoying noisy potato chips crunching neighbours in a ciniema. Nothing must disturb me while I watch this great follow up on Whiplash from Damien Chazelle in creating this romance musical. Musicals is a tough genre because very few musicals have impressed me, perhaps because I haven\u00b4t been impressed with the castings of musical movies. Not Chicago, or All that Jazz or Ma Ma Mia or the most recent Les Mizerables. But La La has hit the ball out of the court. It had  two of the most winsome darlings and talented actors, Ryan and Emma. Their on screen chemistry was magic. The heart simply soared to dizzy heights while watching them dance and sing. All focus centred on Ryan and Emma while everything else became oblivious and unimportant. Most scenes if not all were one shot long sequences underlining how challenging it was for the actors to get it right over a five minute non stop shot. The choreography and set decorations were too beautiful for words. The ending was a reality bite because two talented people who are in love must go their separate ways because they had to make painful personal sacrifices including saying goodbye to sweet love in order to entertain the masses one day. At least hopeless romantics like myself were treated to an alternate reality where Ryan and Emma would live together happily ever after. A greatly underrated actor, Gosling was brilliant at the piano with many close up scenes of his fingerings on the keyboard. Yes, it was all Ryan. No doubles. It was heartening to have Chazelle so young and talented because we look forward to seeing more gems from him in the future.",

The acting is superb, the music is f*cking amazing (Epilogue is the single greatest piece of musical score that I have ever heard), the choreography is extremely impressive, the direction is fabulous, and the cinematography and set design are spectacular. You know a film is a amazing when the only part of a film you dislike, is still one of the best scenes of the movie. I think that the observatory scene feels a little out of place, and takes the movie from an 'as believable as it gets musical' to two superheroes hanging in the air (I guess Spiderman didn't kill Gwen this time ;).)\n\n\nOverall La La Land is simply put the best movie of 2016 (top 3 of the decade), and should have easily won the Best Picture Oscar. (For those people who call this overrated, clearly you haven't seen the definition of overrated. It's directed by Barry Jenkins, and is called Moonlight.)",

The sad part is that at the end you are left with this empty feeling at the end and kind of depressed but more that these two couldn't be bothered to try hard enough in relationships and it ends up causing the sadness at the end.

I guess the reason why damien chazelle did not pick professional singers/dancers is because he did not think this film like a musical, but like a movie with some songs and dancing in it. Though, as amateurs, emma and ryan made a wonderful job. La la land made me dream and will forever be part of my favorite movies. It plays between realism and fantasy, it also has some visionnary shots. The director clearly is a genius.

La la land felt like an intense attempt to look like an old school version super imposed on a modern day scenario, but failing miserably to produce a fraction of the emotional resonance that a musical should. The present's wrappings were spectacular, but there was nothing inside. I'm still not clear on what exactly drew the romantic leads to one another. What did they like? Passion for their individual dreams was inferred, but not exactly developed. Their love affair was even more fragile then explained by a few critics. While I got a small kick out of the inside LA references, it only served to remind me of the multitude of reasons why I can't stomach living there long term. (I grew up in LA). Everybody is jockeying for position, but substance is practically non-existent. There's a party somewhere every night of the week, and everybody is working their ass off to get that one break, but the question is Why??? Fame, fortune, visibility? Whatever happened to telling a really, really good story? To me, this was a paper thin story... kind of like modern day Hollywood. The storytellers have left the building. Only the template is left. Gorgeous sets, check. Frame for frame nods to past classics, check. Camera angles, check. Facial and body blocking shots of impossibly camera friendly actors, check. Exactly structured musical numbers with impossibly cheesy writing, check. But you forgot the substance, The profundity. They tried an Umbrellas of Cherbourg ending, but failed to recognize that Umbrellas was written in a time when people still believed in love to the point where lives were irretrievably altered and devastated if lovers didn't make it long term. You can tell nobody really believes in love like that in the movie. Not to where it alters you. It's implied, but you don't feel it. I didn't feel ANYTHING. Which is too bad, because I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's acting. I just wish they had b,een given more to work with.",

Having now seen the film, I must say I'm sorry Mr. Jackson. Your contention was not in vein. La la land's numerous Oscar wins may be the proof we needed to show that the Academy is overrun by a certain demographic: those who remember the 1950's and 60's with fondness, and likely shed a tear in nostalgic reminision when Ryan Gosling tapped his feet and Emma Stone squealed in delight.\n\nI'm four months pregnant and watching La la land was more nauseating than morning sickness.",

            "content": "The movie musical is something of the past. Bygone. Dormant.\nThe genre's attempted revival arrived last year via Damien Chazelle in the form of alleged crowd-pleaser La La Land, a weakly conceived project whose disappointing first act flows into a second that achieves striking depths of dullness. The film's only truly magnificent scene is it's very last, meaning that the credits start rolling as soon as you've become truly engaged. \n\n\"Another Day of Sun\" kicks the film off. Rather clumsily. The song is a sprightly, uplifting ditty that ultimately has no lasting effect because it's wasted on an idiotic, messily choreographed and haphazard dance number that features nameless, curiously uncharacterized folk clumsily clamoring over traffic-halted cars in one moment and a blonde proudly flashing her undergarments in the next. It's an incredibly rough start to a dishearteningly mediocre movie.\n\nSoon after comes the introduction of wannabe actress Mia. Her first interaction with Sebastian is an egregious, unabashed raise of the middle finger, immediately establishing her petulant, whiny, puerile mess of a character. It also doubles as a gesture to viewers who are anticipating a film that is innovative and intelligent. Mia is played laboriously by the otherwise insanely likable Emma Stone, whose inherent charms are one of La La Land's few saving graces. Ryan Gosling's performance as pianist Sebastian (or \"Seb,\" as he's most commonly referred to as) isn't much better, and the popular actor goes on to prove through the movie's flurry of songs that he, for the life of him, can't sing or carry a tune. The only likable characters, Mia's delightful roommates, are stranded in extremely minor roles. The horribly overrated John Legend also appears, and he's forced to perform as a character even more dull and obnoxious than the two protagonists combined. He's also tasked with carrying the weight of the worst song in the entire film.\n\nThe majority of the music mostly goes to waste, which, needless to say, is a deadly mistake for a musical to make. Each song is undermined by awkward camerawork, uninspired visuals, and a general lack of inspiration. There's a nagging sense of familiarity that can't be shaken. The aptly named \"Epilogue\" is the only tune that avoids those four fatal attributes and it truly succeeds in making a lasting impression, along with the scene it accompanies. The conclusion is moving, well-filmed, and evocative- three things the rest of the film only wishes it was.\n\nPerhaps the picture's greatest sin is its utter inability to deliver on it's lofty promise. La La Land is widely praised as a pure delight and return to glory for the musical genre, when it fails to qualify as either of those things. The film is not intellectually inclined and is content to deliver an unbelievably cliched and overused message: follow your dreams. Countless other movies and works of fiction have made the pursuit of one's dreams it's central theme with rocky results, and it's crystal clear that Damien Chazelle and the screenwriters did not learn from them.\n\nThe poorly drawn characters, weak writing, and the lack of a brain to go with its beating heart render La La Land a mostly unspectacular dud, unworthy of its effusive acclaim and glowing reputation. The film has noble intentions, but they never come to fruition. It's more a celebration of insecure brats that don't know how to pursue their dreams in a rational fashion than a loving homage to the Hollywood of old. A better title for this misfire would be \"Blah Blah Bland.\"",

What makes the film, for me, is the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.

The musical numbers were really well thought out with most of them designed to appear as single take shots, and they all had great direction in the camera work, cinematography, timing, and choreography. Emma Stone has been my favorite actress for years now, probably since at least Zombieland and Easy A, and she really shines here and easily deserves the awards she won for the role, as do most of the people involved in this movie. While the movie takes place in modern day, it does a great job bringing the nostalgic feel of older movies and times, and this mixing of new and old plays a central role in the story as well, so it's the perfect style to tell this story in. I'm also glad to see another musical taking on the live singing approach we first saw in the new Les Mis\u00e9rables movie, as I think it does a lot to add to the realness of the performances, which can otherwise sometimes feel phoney during those big musical numbers. La La Land was my favorite movie of 2016, and is a classic I know I'll be watching again and again.\n\nPersonal Grade: S++\nTechnical Score: 98%",

And from start to finish the acting, music, and cinematography are just beautiful.\n\nThe first big nod needs to go to Justin Hurwitz, who has composed an excellent modern-day musical about the struggles and magic of \"La La Land\". Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling shine in great performance roles that they mold into their own, never feeling like they're acting but rather let their characters leap off the screen and allow the viewer to fill in all the emotion that they are going through. Again highlighting the fantastic music and the natural performances, combined with Chazelles uses of long takes and pans takes you back to the Hollywood of old, when you needed to be a true performer (singing, dancing, acting) and gives off a stage show feel on the silver screen. \n\nThe use of colour and light is brilliant, every shot feeling structured, planned, and well executed to provide optimum emotional value and connection to our dreamers. Again, driven by a fantastic screenplay and strong performances across the board - this is a movie that belongs in everyone's library. Especially the aspiring film makers - everything you want to learn about how to make a great film is here. Which is what makes it great - redundantly. \n\nAll great films are teaching films.

Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both give extraordinary performance and have great chemistry together.  And the comedy is really well-done, and has a subtle and clever humor to it.  Also, the musical numbers are quite good and are integrated in a very natural way; particularly the choreography, which is incredibly creative.  However, the film kind of gets tripped up on the ending, and whether one should sacrifice love for dreams.  It's not without some flaws, but overall La La Land is touching and beautiful film.",

Emma Stone was slightly better (especially in the audition song), but not amazing.  There are better singers in the shows on cruise ships.

While watching this movie i at so many instances felt that what the character was feeling in that moment i could relate to that and one of the scenes when Emma Stone's character says Maybe i am not just good enough to do this and that hits a little close to home. This movie relates so well to each one of us in different ways, maybe you relate to the romantic factor of this movie, maybe the rejection factor or maybe you want to feel what its like to be in love.

It is a musical about an actress (Emma Stone) and a musician (Ryan Gosling) who are trying to get their carriers off the ground. La La Land was a surprise for me. All it really is, is a mid-20th century musical with modern-day revisement. It was a masterpiece. This flick had some solid performances that really stood out. The use of color was noticeably good, along with some of the best lighting of that year. The story was compelling as well. I thought it was unpredictable, in a good way. La La Land is truly a game-changing film. It is in my opinion, a movie that brought back the genre.\nOver all, La La land is the very definition of a love letter to Hollywood. It is by-far the best musical of recent years. 5/5 stars",

Damien Chazelle's ambition and skill as a director make this film the dream-like experience it is. Very few directors can handle the surreal without becoming pretentious, luckily Damien is one of them. Our leads are wonderful as singers, dancers, musicians and actors, particularly Emma Stone who gives a naturalistic and breath-taking performance. The score and soundtrack are both wonderful experiences on their own, while still remaining important to the plot of the film. The best musicals are ones that use music to foreshadow events in the story or convey a character's emotion, and this film does just that. However, what really makes this film is the cinematography. Almost every scene has expertly crafted use of colour, camera movement, choreography and detail. Because of this, you can rewatch the film several times and notice new things you didn't before, enhancing the experience. La La Land is a film that perfectly encapsulates dreams and dreamers, and the dangers that come with both.",

            "content": "I am going to try to convince you to see this fantastic movie : La La Land ! It is really one of the best film I have ever seen in my life...  So, La La Land is a musical directed in 2016 by Damien Chazelle (who won the Academy Award for Best Director) and the two lead actors are Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.\nLa La Land tells the story of Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a dedicated jazz musician who are both passionnate about dance and singing. They meet in Los Angeles and a love story is set up between the two characters. But the plot is really based on their career : their tries, their successes and mostly their failures... \nThe acting is just amazing ! Well, of course Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are originally brilliant actors but in this musical, they overstep the mark and they explode the screen. Their roles are extremely difficult seeing as they have to dance and sing. It is not regular to see actors in this position. This movie is hard to play because it brushes past different genres : it is of course a musical and all the difficulties that it represents for the acting but it touches also the romance, the comedy and finally the drama genre. So I can say that the actor's performance is absolutely great ! By the bye, Emma Stone won the Academy Award for Best Actress In A Leading Role for her Mia's role in La La Land.\nIt seems to me very important to write some words about the film techniques... Just to precise, to the Academy Awards Ceremony, La La Land cleared out the Award for Best Original Music Score, the Award for Best Cinematography and the Award for Best Production Design ! There is something which is magic in this movie : the atmosphere. In fact, the story takes place in present days but the setting, the costumes are older : it feels like being in the United States in the 50's. It is very funny and enjoyable. What about music ? Well, of course it is the common thread of the movie. But it takes a particular place for the characters : for exemple, one of the song is often repeated by Mia and Sebastian when they are sad or demotivated... and another one is characteristic of happy moments. The movie plays also on lighting sometimes like when a spotlight is pointed at an actor so as to give a kind of theatrical effect to the scene.\nOf course La La Land wants to stage actors who represents the difficulties and all the hard process to get their break in the world of theatre, cinema and music. But even if La La Land presents a dramatic aspect of this situation, the movie encourages people to have dreams and to believe in its. Furthermore, (SPOILER ALERT) in the film, the love story have not a happy ending but it allows them to progress in their carrer and to do evoluate the two characters : it is a springboard. So, La La Land is not just a superficial romance but it deals also with important topics. \nIt is just gorgeous, like a flipbook made of dreamy vintage postcards that are somehow about contemporary life in Los Angeles. Chazelle's strong direction coupled with powerful performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling help to create a wonderful and nostalgic treat at the cinema. I think it would be a shame to do not see La La Land seeing as it is still the most rewarded film this year !",

My problems with the film started after around the 1 hour mark, the story kinda collapses into clich\u00e9s and becomes quite unoriginal, despite the ending, I really liked how the film conluded.

Se the movie as if it's from the POV of a \"true dreamer\" in our very real and harsh world. It's heartbreakingly wonderfull, a real work of art, made with real passion (or just great production for those of a more cynical nature).",

This film has a look and feel that hearkens back to the Technicolor musicals of the '60s (I was particularly reminded of West Side Story), but with modern updates to camera technique, acting, and pacing. From what I could tell, most, if not all, of the musical numbers were recorded in a single take, including a tour de force opening number on a jam-packed freeway on-ramp. The camera swoops and glides, yet the action is always perfectly framed. Emma Stone performed powerfully, while Gosling seemed totally natural, which takes a whole other level of skill to achieve. There are a few fantasy sequences, which may confuse some people, but they showcase the director's deft handling of light and colour. This is a film for film-lovers.",

The movie would've fared better had it not been a musical. La La Land desperately needs better choreographers and more memorable songs. While it executes its simple story well with believable character development, the sections of the movie where they break into song lack energy and have you waiting for the next bit of the story to come along.\n\nHowever, every other aspect of the movie is great and one thing that makes the simple story stand out is the film's excellent use of its scenery and camera to craft imagery that is not only great to look at, but has a wealth of symbolism hidden within. Every scene in the movie has an artistic attention to detail that is nothing short of poetic. La La Land is a good movie, but a mediocre musical.\n\nWhile it is a bland musical, there are a two exceptions in it regarding its songwriting, as \"City of Stars\" and \"Fools Who Dream\" are excellently written and stand out among the movie's mostly generic lyrical pieces. The instrumental soundtrack, however, is a different story, and is excellent all throughout. Unfortunately, two good songs and great instrumentals are not enough to get a musical going and need good choreography to lift it all up. The slow camera pans, while difficult to do, as it means the scene needs to be taken in one cut, is an overused effect that actually harms the movie rather than benefit it. This effect is one reason why the movie's musical sections feel bland, taking away some energy that could've been gained by having extra camera angles and it is worsened by being used in every scene in the movie, instead of saving it for the slower, more impactful moments. I understand that the effect was to further the Broadway feeling, but then the choreography should've been better to make up for it.\n\nAll in all, La La Land could've been better. I've taken a half star off the movie for the bland feel and gave the movie a lot of credit for the poetic visuals. The movie has a slow start, but makes up for it with a well executed ending that effectively demonstrates the movie's great sense of imagination and the symbolism that not many movies can do.",

While it's true that the overall premise may be quite simple, it contains many elements of the daily life most of us can identify with: dreaming, loving, happiness, regretting, frustration, letting go, and so on. \n\nThe acting on the other hand is flawlessly played by its protagonists, and thanks to a great character development it feels human and appealing.\n\nThe music is also memorable, well written and well played as the plot develops. Technically speaking is a masterful execution of great technique, relying in great photography, editing, sound mixing and production.",

For examples, watch An American in Paris, Singin' in the Rain, or The Band Wagon to see what I mean. What makes Chazelle's 3rd feature so incredible is how brilliantly he understand how to reference history. He skillfully recontextualizes the vernacular of the American musical for the modern age. The exquisite score by Justin Hurwitz, elaborate production design by David Wasco, those costumes by Mary Zophres, the Technicolor, the romance - La La Land's aesthetic borrows from history but the time period and the characters are rooted firmly in contemporary society. 2016 is all here: cell phones, Hybrid vehicles, the part-time job as a barista. Chazelle makes our present era seem so much more magical. There is an exuberant quality I haven't seen recently.  Mia and Sebastian radiate sweetness too. This uncorrupted pair shares a purity. You want them to be together. Their emotion is real. You fall in love. This why we go to the cinema. If I may paraphrase a famous expression once said by Humphrey Bogart, La La Land is the stuff that [movies] are made of. It is sublime.\n\nfastfilmreviews.com",

I prefer an Elvis film to this and even Mamma Mia. \nI struggle to see the appeal of why it was lauded and won awards. It's appeal is it's a feel good movie and no one has done a musical for awhile so reward it. \nThe people I have spoken to, that have seen it, the majority of the opinion is it's OK. So where this mass hysteria of its the best film and all this awards and nominations is baffling. It's good but forgettable",

            "content": "\"La La Land\" is grand. Not as good as Chazelle's \"Whiplash\" from a couple years ago, but still a near immaculately made film from a technical standpoint. Can't really find a tangible gripe for it, so I guess that means it's one worth recommending.\n\nMy main hiccup with this movie is that it is completely safe. This is a movie that clearly aims for \"Best Picture\" heights, because nothing is quite so ingratiating to Hollywood than a movie about Hollywood. Especially when this \"La La Land\" in question is presented with virtually no flaws or corruption. I understand that the film is doing this intentionally, and that the whole idea of the aesthetic is to bring back visions of the Gene Kelly golden age of Hollywood musicals. And to that end, the film is executed with near-perfect precision. But I could not help but keep thinking back to \"Whiplash\" and how bold that film was both in presentation and the statements it was making. This film is likewise about never giving up on dreams, and the more realistic, non-coruscating elements which bookend the film promise a real payoff on that front. But the majority of the movie's main body is so concerned with getting just the right lighting, just the right dance moves, and just the right timing that much of the blood, sweat and tears that come along with that promise are cast aside. \n\nThis is a movie that simultaneously knows exactly what it wants to be and yet flirts with something dingier and more poignant. And my admittedly personal tastes almost always respond more to the latter. So for me, this film is a technical marvel that objectively deserves all of its accolades from a purely cinematic place of critique, but it just doesn't have anything truly original or memorable to say. And that is disheartening, because Damien Chazelle might just be the most talented person in movies today. I just hope he continues to push himself and his audience into more groundbreaking territory in the future.",

            "content": "I confess I don't pay much attention to movie buzz or awards shows. Sometimes, this leads to surprises, such as when I left the theater of one of the worst movies I've seen in a year, only to near-literally run face-first into the promotional cutout for La La Land, gilded with rave-review quotes and blaring award nomination claims.\n\nI have been mystified ever since. La La Land is awful. Just awful. It's not even good at what it tries to be; not a single song from the movie stuck with me the moment the last note faded. Ostensibly a throwback to the Good Old Days (ugh), it only manages to succeed in that respect by virtue (read: detriment) of its hideous whiteness. It's just... \n\nOkay, you know what? Let's just get into it.\nMia (played by the usually delightful Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress, living with a bunch of disposable women so unimportant they only exist to unconvincingly suggest Mia is white-people-version-of-struggling financially, and to sing an instantly-forgettable song about Mia prostituting herself at a Showbiz Industry Party on the chance someone might notice her, then disappear and are never heard from again. Which is fitting, since Mia is similarly a barely two-dimensional prop for the men behind (and in front of) the cameras.\nNot that we believe Mia is struggling; she works as a barista for the rich and famous, right in the rosy-pink cornhole center of Peckerwood, Crackerfornia. (Seriously, this movie couldn't get any whiter.)\n\nSebastian (played by the perpetually sleepy-eyed, yet usually likable Ryan Gosling) lives alone (in a place he couldn't afford) because nobody could possibly like this self-satisfied, pretentious douchebag. He's also broke (see above, re: couldn't afford), because he keeps getting fired for being a self-satisfied, pretentious douchebag. We're supposed to sympathize with him because reasons. They actually give a reason, but it's a stupid one, because this prick should have been fired long before he proved what a pompous tool he is by demanding his version of purity.\n\nWhaddya mean, \"purity\", you ask? What, is he a jazz fan or something? OF COURSE HE'S A JAZZ FAN. What other kind of music could such a strident, humorless, unlikeable asshole possibly take mortally seriously than the music of pretentious hacks and dilettantes? Oh, and he plays it, too, because duh. Jazz is the music of frustrated mediocrity. But I won't hold that against the movie.\nI digress. \nIt also doesn't help that he's another white knight - emphasis on the white - trying to save The Blah People from themselves, as amply demonstrated when he inexplicably lands a paying gig with a jazz-ish-sorta-not-exactly-inspired fusion band, led, of course, by one of those silly black people who ruin good music, natch. How brave to put a whitewashed spin on the norm; we've *never* seen that before. Where would black people be, without savior-douche Sebastian to reverse-Pat Boone them?\n\nSo. Mia and Sebastian (Goddess Eris, even his *name* is intolerable) meet and like each other for no reason just because without explanation apropos of nothing inexplicably something something script. Not before Sebastian is a complete dick to Mia, of course. Then they sing together about how safe it is to walk around their heavily-policed, lily-white neighborhood in the middle of the night in Los Angeles. Look, I know I'm hitting the race thing pretty hard, but in my defense, they started it.\n\nThere's absolutely no tension in Mia's so-quickly-dispelled-it-never-existed resistance to Sebastian's super-winning \"charms\" (Does he pinch his ham flower so hard it could cut a railroad spike in half when Emma says she doesn't like jazz? Duh-DOY. Does he aggressively browbeat her until she says she's wrong out of sheer exhaustion? Stop asking stupid questions). Nobody in the entirety of existence believes they won't get together. IT'S IN THE MOVIE POSTER, for crying out loud. Put your lame attempts at tension somewhere you haven't already given away the resolution.\n\nSo, anyway, they have a relationship while I nodded off during a salad-days montage. Seriously, I dozed for about five minutes during this. Blah blah blah, forty excruciating minutes of Sebastian looking constipated because he's getting rich and famous by playing music people actually like, and then Mia and Sebastian have their clockwork, by-the-numbers, Big Scary Fight right on cue, and naturally, it makes no sense, with Mia and Sebastian emoting because the script says so, and not because what they're saying or doing would be upsetting. \"You want me to be HAPPY?!? THAT MAKES ME ANGRY! GRRR!\" (I'm not kidding; that was a key point in their argument.)\n\nThen follows another chance for me to take a nap, so at least there's that, while something something montage. Mia becomes rich and famous, because of course she does, despite the movie taking great pains to paint her as eminently mediocre at best. Sebastian ditches that awful black man and his soulless cultural appropriation of true, pure white aryan jazz, and starts his dream nightclub nobody would ever be interested in going to, which is of course standing-room-only filled with who-the-hipster-knows, because GAWD, what a hellhole of excrement-reeking pretentiousness and awful music. Must be a front for a meth lab or something.\n\nThen there's a montage, because of course there is. Then it ends an hour and a half too late. I won't spoil the ending, because there isn't one. Nobody learns or grows, white people succeed because of course they do, and the movie writer and a few other douchenozzles hose their shorts because jazz is awesome and not at all a dissonant, pointless, masturbatory exercise in self-congratulatory, Grateful Dead-level dicking around on instruments for musicians who were never talented enough to play music with any meaning. The End.\n\nAt least they got the name right, because La La Land is the only place this supermassive rusty bullet hole of a movie could possibly be considered good, let alone so amazingly, gloriously, fabulously scrumtrulescent that Hollywood has no choice but to explode in an auto-rimming, self-congratulatory orgasm of--\n\nOhhhhhh. NOW I get it.",

            "content": "La La Land is a 2016 musical drama film directed by Damien Chazelle, of Whiplash fame, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. The film follows Seb and Mia, two people with big dreams who meet and fall in love in the city of angels, L.A. Having won seven Golden Globes, the most Golden Globes won by a film, I had big expectations for the it. And I'm happy to report, I was not disappointed! \n\nThe film's two stars are truly wonderful, having both won Golden Globes for their roles. Ryan Gosling plays Sebastian, a down on his luck Jazz musician who dreams of opening his own Jazz club. Emma Stone plays an aspiring actress waiting for her big break. After a few chance encounters and musical numbers, romance blossoms for the two dreamers. Gosling and Stone's chemistry is incredible and really makes the film what it is. Their own singing and dancing in the film, while not perfect really adds a sense of realism, making the characters a lot more relatable. Special shoutout to J.K. Simmons, having played an asshole teacher in Chazelle's previous film and now playing an asshole bar owner. It's impossible not to enjoy his skills! \n\nChazelle, only 31 years old, directed the film masterfully and has shown himself to be incredibly talented, winning, you guessed it, a Golden Globe for the film! The cinematography is beautiful providing some stunning backdrops for the romantic couple as they dance away. One of my favourite aspects of the film was the use of incredibly creative transitions between scenes. Never before have I turned to my friends during the film just to talk about screen transitions but Chazelle's creativity shines through here. He's definitely a director to look out for if you weren't already! \n\nBeing a musical, the soundtrack is a key part of the film. The songs written for the film are certainly no let down, with the huge musical number opening the film and more serene throughout being very reminiscent of 50s musicals sick as Singin in the Rain. My personal favourite numbers would be Another Day of Sun and Someone in the Crowd. The film does an excellent job of providing 50s nostalgia such as the 'Cinemascope' opening and colourful costumes and sets. \n\nThe ending of the film is admittedly a little unexpected and jarring. It's certainty emotional and really drives home some interesting messages about following your dreams. The film, especially the ending, is best summed up the same way Seb describes Jazz: \"It's conflict and it's compromise. And it's very, very exciting\". \n\nOverall, the film is wonderfully crafted and a whole lot of fun. It's a real feel good film and just makes you feel like dancing. I definitely recommend it and expect to hear a lot more success from the film when the Oscars roll around. I'll certainly be singing its praises!",

            "content": "One Girl Who's Not Too Far in La La Land to See How It's Off-Beat\n\nAfter Sunday's mix-up at the Oscars many of you may be wondering how valid Moonlight's win is. I'm here to tell you that it is just. La La Land was truly a great film and they deserved to hold that Oscar, but it wasn't so great that they deserved to keep it.\n\nI grew up watching movies from the golden age of musicals and studied them in my ballroom dancing days to fine-tune my performance of numbers paying homage to the classics. So when critics began saying La La Land resurrected the musical genre I walked into the theater expecting to be taken to my happy place. \n\nI was disappointed when I was brought in and out of my nostalgic paradise by clunky and contrived transitions into and out of musical numbers, effectively categorizing each scene as either a musical or a drama. As enchanting as the movie is, it is impossible for an audience to be swept off their feet during the mess that is trying to dance with two partners.\n\nThe first, and most off-putting partner change is just after the elaborate and large opening number set in an LA traffic jam. The music and dance come to a screeching halt as our main characters, Mia and Sebastian, have their meet-cute where they exchange a honk, a finger and a glare.\n \nThe audience is forced to abruptly switch partners multiples times as we watch Mia and Sebastian repeatedly run into each other and try to suppress their increasingly romantic feelings, which leads us to the now iconic number in front of the LA city scape. The least coordinated change of partner happens in this scene when Mia sits down, removes her heels and changes into tap shoes. Now, it is my humble opinion that the only person allowed to change costuming on camera is Mister Rogers but keep in mind that our neighbor intentionally did it to signify the beginning and end of something. \n\nIn any case, our tedious tango between drama and musical continues as we watch Mia and Sebastian succumb to love and watch how their relationship is affected by the progression of their individual Hollywood careers. \n\nA seamless plot isn't everything in a musical; the choreography and music are important aspects to consider. Unfortunately, these aspects step on each other's toes in La La Land. The music would build to a dramatic climax while our main characters were in the middle of their 3rd set of pas de bourree's, making it seem as though the dances were originally choreographed to a different song.\n\nThe misstep between the music and the choreography has nothing to do with the score. Justin Hurwitz deserved the Oscar for Best Original Music Score by creating a beautifully whimsical yet melancholy soundtrack that perfectly encompasses the story of one's first great love.\n \nThe actors are also not to blame for La La Lands shortcomings. Emma Stone was captivating in this role which was reflected in her Oscar win for her performances as Mia. As a pair, Emma and Ryan Gosling (Sebastian) delivered an emotionally captivating performance that every person who's had a great love can relate to.\n\nLa La Land's two left feet belong to Director, Damien Chazelle, who failed to put as much energy into the flow of the film as he did every other aspect. Having received the Oscar for Best Director, Chazelle probably feels pretty satisfied with La La Land since it has all the technical components of the genre. But without proper transitioning it is overtly contrived, a critique he also received for his 2014 film 'Whiplash'. \n\nAll things considered, if a passion of romantic movies is what's leading you toward La La Land, it is a must see. The cinematography, music and acting will take you on a journey reflective of your own first great love. But if you're wanting a polished musical, know that the hard-to-get flirting between musical and drama will leave you frustrated when the two never hook-up.",

Can they sing well? nope. It felt too much like the movie was playing during an open-mic karaoke night. Honestly, I could have let that slide, if it weren't for the ridiculous insipidness of the curt wrap-up ending that had no story development  at all. A couple that declares their eternal love for another is the end of one scene. The next thing, it's 5 years later--the two of them are no longer together, she's married to a guy we've never seen and she has a young child. The audience had already been informed that she would be in rehearsal for 3 months and then in Paris for 4 months. Last time I checked, 7 months is only just over half a year and if she really was in love with Gosling's character, why would all of that have just suddenly disappeared in less than a year??? Other romantic movies have successfully pulled off the failed love story--Annie Hall and The Way We Were are great examples that come to mind. But these movies made it a major point of their story's development to show how two people who deeply love each other cannot ultimately share their lives together. This movie failed to do this on any level. If the producers of this film thought that turning the classic movie-musical on its head with a sad ending would be new and praise worthy, they clearly forgot about West Side Story, Moulin Rouge, and Sweeney Todd. Ultimately, I just felt like this movie had a lot to deliver, and it just couldn't do it.",

Nor were the actors able to pull off the dancing. I had just gone to a movie showing of Singing in the Rain. This pales in comparison. And Debbie Reynolds had never danced before! The voices weren't memorable either, but that is easier to forgive because many good musicals were hits without trained voices. Also, the acting was okay in a super simplistic plot. This just confirms to me to be suspicious of any show that wins awards. Any that do will usually be something I won't like!",

Emma Stone started off with a weak, aspirate sound, and developed a fuller tone in the middle of \"Here's to the One's Who Dream.\" I am leery about Hollywood musicals because they get people who are amateur singers that look good. At least they should dub them with professional singers like they did in My Fair Lady. At least that would have really earned the award for Best Picture. I'm sorry, Ryan Gossling is an incredible actor, and man he played that piano, and yet he needs to work on his singing voice. \"City of Stars\" is too low for him. He sounded like Russell Crowe in Les Mis.\nThe writing is cliche and garbage. In fact one of the girls in the movie makes fun of the story itself. The music makes the film pop. I loved the jazz, and the chorus numbers, yet the two main songs were not very good. This film is not a musical. It's a fantasy film with musical numbers, yet the music does not flow through the movie. The dichotomy between acting and music divides the main characters rather than uniting them, until the dream sequence. Why not just end it on that note? The dream sequence added a David Lynch vibe, as if the dream were reality and the two characters were in a five year bitter sweet nightmare. If it had ended on the dream sequence then the movie would have been genius, almost equal to Mullholland Drive, or Inland Empire. Yet they take the nostalgic way and we get a cliche ending. Over all I give this film a whopping 8/10.",

Is a classic musical set in the real world, with real and flawed people, not perfect singers and dancers that also happen to be the perfect couple. This is a hopeful film, so needed after the crappy year that was 2016, and that is one of the thigns I like the most about it. And its hopeful without turning into a Disney movie. It's for the new generations, where the people prefer to develop professionally than to sacrifice everything for love. This movie masterfully combines a soul of the past with a mentality of the present and, because of that, it's a complete hit and a modern classic.",

In my opinion, a movie has done its job, if it made you feel something, but all I was left at the end of this movie was the feeling that it wasn't made for me, or the audience, but the 60 year old voters of the Academy. The 93% rating is definitely misleading, I would say, in reality, it's probably somewhere around 80-85%.",

Those who have seen it will know what I mean. But as a best pict nod I say not really. I wanted to love this film so much but just didn't. The visuals were great but not life changing and there was some strange stuff with the stars that actually reminded me of the car flying at the end of Grease which I never understood. There is not enough if a supporting cast to make this film a great musical. The opening numbers was not necessary to the plot was hard to understand and really wasn't that greatly sung. I don't think it's worth all it's award hype sorry to say. Ryan and Emma are great in it but again I would say their performances were oscar worthy.

            "content": "My problem with La La Land\n\nI will start with what captivated me about Chazzelle's film.  The LA scenery, particularly the scene where Gosling and Stone are walking to their cars and they perform the tap number (seeing them physically change shoes for the routine was particularly cute).  The long takes.  Wow!  Such impressive hard work.  Really, hard work sums up the impression of what has been done in this picture.  Okay! Time to complain.  \nLa La Land got the most nominations at this year's Golden Globes, and won ALL OF THEM.  I do not think the movie is bad, but comparing it to it's competitors, I feel beat when it wins.  La La Land - the name invites itself to witnessing fantasy as something not attainable, or if it is, pointless and gotten by chance.  Gosling is a jazz piano player, and Stone is an actress, and their characters are written as if they've been described by a sub-par television character performed by my favorite actor, Gael Garcia Bernal, that \"they perform with the blood\", and we're expected to accept that and follow the kiddie pool plot.\n  La La - dreaming... it is what their aspirations are for the first part of the film.  The movie is broken up into Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, and 5 years later.  The seasons appear for no other purpose than to show a brief change in time.  Throughout that year in northern hemisphere exposure to the sun,  we see the leads going from embarrassing auditions and economic hardships, to giddy romance, to achieving their dreams, losing their romance, and feeling sad about it.  Sigh.  I have no idea what happened during summer.Even movie stars feel sad?  Not all that glitters is gold?  No, I'm sure there's more to it that that, but the movie blankets itself in cliches so that the plot is easy to follow - we know the story is fantasy, the characters... it's no shock to me I have no idea what their names are, they were written for the . bankability of Stone's not completely there grace within earnest gumption, and Gosling's stand in front of a voiceless band of black jazz performers, and tell you what jazz is about talents, white hollywood heartthrob talents.\nWhat's upsetting about the takeaway of awards in the acting category is not the performances.  Stone's eagerness, if not exactly moving, is at least infectious, but it is nowhere near her dualistic exude your world, and slink away performance of a recovering drug addict in Birdman.  Gosling's performance I can say less positive things for.  Most of what we think we feel from his character comes from the movie's score as he plays the piano (which I read was in fact him!), head down.  This also pales considerably against his richer work with Derek Cranfrance.  Most of Stone's real competition is in the Drama category of Globes (Portman is all things Jackie Kennedy in Pablo Loraine's 2nd best film of the year.  Ruth Negga, despite a script that's attempts for realism I'm sure writes a much more quiet portrayal of it's characters than their real life counterparts, still makes the best with it's quiet moments.  Amy Adams carries the sci-fi thriller, Arrival, and bridges the genre gap to the melodrama audience of Lifetime fair).  But it's sad to see that this minimally fleshed out character won against 20th Century Women's Dorthea, played by Annette Bening.  The focus of 20th Century Women is of a son trying to figure out his mom, getting deep and sparking insights, that burn out without reaching a conclusion to his quest.  This performance of a woman too mysterious to capture, is captivatingly performed by an actress who gets to shine brighter and more centered than she ever has in a movie, and who has been too often overlooked (for Hilary Swank).  That performance lost to that of a character whose big revealing backstory for when we got bac to her hometown was that she really always wanted to be an actress.  Oh,the power of showing someone persistently reach for their dreams, has on a group of Americans, or film makers I suppose.\n\tA movie can be more than the sum of its two-dimensional characters.  I can allow it that much patience.  I can respect how the figures on the screen are placed into position, and audience expectations that allow us to see that la la, dreaming, can look many different ways to the same person simultaneously and at different times.  The last scene in particular showed us a fantasy with a  completely different font and filter than what we had been seeing, and it was effective in how differently it appeared, but how utterly still not reality.  What holds this story back is how little it understands the richness , and variety to reality.\nOne more rant, I already mentioned it, and it's a popular critique, but really?  Ryan Gosling is going to save pure jazz?  The corruptor is John Legend?  The film acknowledges jazz's roots and dominant sourcing in the black community by the majority of silent black players in its jazz scenes, but gives that little bar a white messiah.  Now, I understand racial typecasting and stereotyping shouldn't reserve roles, but they didn't consider challenging those when casting their charming leads of their musical.\nLook, I know I personally care about these awards more than I should.  But many people do.  What we watch is important.  Yes, from the rest of our nominees it's clear that this Oscars is not #sowhite.  But it says something when brilliant white showmanship get the spotlight, and gay black boys, and strong women who had to wait still stand in the shadow.  What is it about showmanship that lets us forgive all shortcomings and sins?",

Damien Chazelle made one of my favorite movies a few years ago with Whiplash, and this looked like it could be almost as good. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have proven to be a perfect pair in past films, so this film was bound for success. This movie may have changed my mind about Musicals as a whole after watching it. Every musical number starting with the opening scene was jaw-dropping, and the choreography was absolutely amazing. The performances were all there and the direction from Chazelle is as good as it gets. One of the biggest peeves that I have about the film; though, is that the wonderful J.K.

Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, the leads in this masterpiece, perform their roles in the best possible way. Both of their ambitions and dreams feel so real, specifically Sebastian's love for jazz. It breathed much needed life back into a forgotten genre with breathtaking dancing and singing sequences. Each musical sequence feels seamlessly woven with the story. The dancing and singing feels like a natural continuation of the scene already taking place. This film is not only very well directed, but it also centralizes on the idea that we must pursue our dreams, even if it means sacrificing the things we love.",

The opening scene was especially disappointing--the actors could not even lip sync correctly. Music was ok, but not great. I could not even remember a song as I left the theater.

            "content": "La La Land is a musical that is written and directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Emma Stone and my man Ryan Gosling.\nSo a while back in mid-2016 I was scrolling through my YouTube recommendations desperately searching for a new trailer for Suicide Squad (The hype was real) when I came across a trailer for a movie called La La Land. Now of course I knew next to nothing about this movie accept from the fact that it stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as the main characters, oh and it's musical. So after that I pretty much just ignored nearly all the marketing for this movie, then I heard that it had been nominated for 30 awards. That and my mom was desperate to see it. So when it came out in the local theatre I used my pocket money to pay for both of us to go see this movie and my god... this movie is AMAZING!!!!\nI'm not even kidding here this is one of the greatest films I have ever seen not just out of all the movies I saw in 2016 but one of the greatest films I've seen in years. This is coming from a guy who is really not a fan of musicals but his film was just the literal definition perfection.\nThere are 2 things that full on deserve praise weather you love or hate the movie. The camera work, the camera work in this movie is just phenomenal; there are so many times in this movie where you will be thinking how the heck they shot that scene. There are some beautiful shots in this movie that literally made my heart skip a couple of beats L,A is just stunning in this movie I loved the way it was shot. All the musical numbers are shot with long extensive shots with some with literally no jump cuts at all, which leads me to the choreography. Holy spagbowl!!! The choreography in this movie is so well done, most of these musical numbers are shot with almost no jump cuts there just long extensive and brilliantly filmed shots, the actors are literally dancing and singing for the entirety of the songs so that in affect is almost 3 minutes and these dance sequences unfold seamlessly. There is one incredible sequence where Gosling and Stone dance in front of an L, A sunset and it's just incredible. And yes the musical numbers as you can imagine are very energetic and really fun to watch.  And that is partly due to excellent directing which I'll talk more about in just a second. The set design just adds to the visual beauty of the film. I loved the films use of vibrant and colourful backgrounds at the right moments and everything else from the way the scenes were lit was just amazing.\nPretty much all the songs from this movie have been stuck in my head since Thursday which is when I saw this film. There're that good. I honestly haven't really heard any other songs in a musical that are similar to the ones in this film they're just so unique and memorable. \nDamien Chazelle's directing is up there in my top 5. I'm not even joking it's that good. The way he movies the camera in this movie alone is incredible. He tried his absolute best with this movie and it paid off tremendously and the same could be said for the script, the Chezelle's script for this movie might just be one of my favourite Screen plays of all time. This is backed up by some brilliant performance.\nRyan Gosling as usual is fantastic. I really liked how the film explored this character's passion for Jazz, you really feel for this character because he's a very passionate piano player and he can't play what he wants to play because he keeps ending up with jobs where he ends up playing Christmas songs at loads of different restaurants.  A lot of his Jokes landed really well, I really like it when you have someone who has one of the straightest faces and have him be the funniest characters and it works so well in this movie.\nEmma stone is also great in this movie. Her performance never faltered during the entirety of the films run time. Her character is very sympathetic, she's actress trying to break into the film industry and every attempt at that point really doesn't go well for her but she keeps trying. In that leads me to my favourite part of this movie.\nI absolutely loved the romance between these 2 characters. Their romance was just so touching and as well as making for most of the films funniest moments but it felt genuine and surprisingly unpredictable. A lot of romances I see these days feel very predictable and at times clich\u00e9d which is something that I criticised the film Passengers for. But this film was just unpredictable with the way it handled the romance which I thought was really refreshing \nLa La Land is at it's a core a love letter to people who are passionate about what they do, people who dream who will never stop trying to fulfil that dream, the people who want to succeed in doing what they love, someone is going to do exactly that no matter what people think of them will plot ahead. That's who this movie is aimed at. This movie is in a way grabbing anyone passionate by the shoulders and telling them to go fulfil their dreams. This movie genuinely wants people to fulfil their dreams and I really have to point out this movie is actually made by someone who clearly feels that he has done exactly that and is trying to encourage other people to do the same thing.\nI really loved this films message because I'm personally at a stage in my life where I really want to fulfil my dreams and pretty much become successful at what I love doing and what I want to do in the future. And I feel like this film got the message out their better than anything I have really seen before.\nAnd this message is told through fantastic musical numbers that never once got annoying, every time someone started singing it felt like it was just a natural progression of the film it never really felt like it was someone going \"hey this is the part where we sing\" it just felt natural which is something I usually only feel in animated movies, this movie just has such a real feeling to it.  \nLa La Land is one of the best films I've ever seen, I seriously recommend you get check this movie out guys I'm telling you it will be one of the greatest movie theatre experiences of your life.",

With performances from familiar hollywood stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, Damien Chazelle's film was inviting to all audiences, whether they be seasoned musical and cinema followers, or everyday movie go-ers. Overall, the acting, plot line, and stylistic choices are what made the film live up to its Oscar nominated potential. And here's why. \nWithout question, the actors in \"La La Land\" are talented, from the opening scene where hundreds of singers and dancers take over an LA freeway ramp, to the final audition scene that's part spoken, part sung monologue. Even if you didn't know that Ryan Gosling learned how to play piano from scratch for the film, his performance would still be just as impressive. Moreover, the chemistry he has with co star and love interest Emma Stone can be felt from the moment she first hears him perform. Their playful banter and constant sparring with one another create a fast paced and humorous love story that is impossible not to enjoy watching transpire. \nIn fact, the relationship between the two are what made the plot so successful. It didn't have your typical \"love at first sight\" or \"happily ever after\" moment, which you would assume from a film titled \"La La Land\". There was a constant contrast between romantic dreams like floating in space at the planetarium, and realistic hardships like long distance relationships or repeatedly getting rejected at auditions. It was refreshing to have realistic elements to the plot in an otherwise idealistic film.\nArguably the best element of \"La La Land\" was the director's stylistic approach to the film. Chazelle combined color and sound throughout the entire piece to mimic the style of musicals from earlier eras, all with a modern twist. For instance, there was a combination of still wide shots, and interesting points of view while synchronizing to the movements of the dancers. There was little editing done to each scene as well, making an even more seamlessly choreographed production. The deliberate use of color throughout the film was also apparent, and resembled the emotions of the characters. For instance, Emma's bold wardrobe fades to a more neutral palette as her character becomes more mature. It's little details like this that demonstrate Chazelle's craft. \nWhether it wins the Oscar or not, \"La La Land\" is deserving of all praise due to the impressive acting performances, unexpected plot line, and intentional stylistic choices. Overall, Damien Chazelle has introduced a new form of cinema that will undoubtedly inspire the film industry in the future.",

            "content": "The Hollywood musical has all but become a thing of the past and a genre that few filmmakers attempt anymore. If I'm honest, it's really no loss to me. Musicals are not something that I'm overly enthusiastic about. Growing up, I remember liking Grease and contemporary ones like Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge and, especially, John Turturro's Romance and Cigarettes were very enjoyable but, for the most part, I often overlook them. That said, with a record equaling 14 Oscar nominations and a record breaking 7 Golden Globe wins, Damien Chazelle's follow-up to the impressive Whiplash can not be scoffed at.\n\nPlot: Mia (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress in Hollywood struggling to catch a break. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is in the same boat as he dreams of getting out of playing cocktails bars and becoming a serious jazz musician. Their paths cross and as their relationship blossoms, they are faced with either stardom or holding onto true love instead.\n\nSong, dance, razzmatazz and Jazz are what's on the menu with Chazelle's latest. Whether you enjoy musicals or not will most likely play a huge part in your enjoyment of it, though. Technically, it's wonderful and Chazelle has a real handle on his musical numbers and choreography. It's also quite beautiful to behold. There's no arguing with the style on show here as it's quite a dazzling picture. However, there's very little substance underneath it's style. It suffers from a generic romantic plot and there's a few too many musical ditties to cover up it's glamorously dull narrative.\n\nI actually think I might have enjoyed it more had it been tighter. For a start it's way overlong and overstays it's welcome by a good half hour. There isn't enough material here to warrant its 2hrs 8mins running time. In fact, Chazelle really wrings the material out at the end. To paraphrase one of my six-year-old daughter's more unusual quips: 'He held onto this like he was strangling a baby's neck'. Don't get me wrong, though, the end sequence cleverly brings things full circle and doesn't succumb to formula but I got the distinct feeling that Chazelle never wanted it to finish. Like a rebuffed lover, he refused to let go. And who can blame him when he's having so much fun? I, on the hand, had had enough by that point.\n\nThis being said, it is hard to be unkind to the film as there's an obvious array of quality on display; David Wasco's production design is a sumptuous palette of colour and Linus Sandgren's cinematography captures it beautifully. It's also got two delightful lead performances; Gosling showcases some genuinely impressive piano skills while Stone delivers a wide range of abilities and both of them display an adeptness at their song and dance routines.\n\nCredit where it's due, Chazelle has successfully brought the musical into the modern era with this, unashamedly, nostalgic piece. It's a charming film but not one that excited or entertained me as much it has others. Those that enjoy romantic or musical films will find much more to embrace here and will, undoubtedly, rank it higher than I have. I can't argue with that and I can't say it's a bad film. I appreciated it for what is but musicals in general don't really have me singing from the rooftops.\n\nMark Walker",

It has something to do with the profound disagreement I have with them based on my opinion that there are way better ways to display the surrealism of a mundane or any for that matter situation than a ridiculous dance off - you know like the pointless one at the start of movie. Where it shines for me is when it uses music and dance to show subtle and nonchalant emotions and not something stupendously grandiouse. And except the already mentioned rocky start La la land is exactly that. It takes a basic story - the pursuit of passion and proceeds to add depth to it trough music. Actors performances, music and scene composition are beautiful and combined with it's grounded story it's a movie that is closer to an expirience than anything else. So is it worth an Oscar? Well it's the first musical I've finished so that's worth something.",

            "content": "After months of anticipation, \"La La Land\" has proven itself to be everything that I had hoped!  About 2 minutes into the opening tracking shot, I was obsessed.  The stunning introduction perfectly sets the mood of the story and introduces us to the Los Angeles setting.  This scene is easily my second favorite tracking shot of all time (next to \"Atonement\").  The film pays tribute to classic musicals of the 40's with its lengthy single-take dance sequences like the six-minute tap scene as they search for Stone's Prius.  As the film progresses, each scene is more ambitious than the last and the execution is consistently perfect.  Dancing among the stars in the planetarium, moving in regular motion among bodies in slow motion, an entire scene fading to black as a spotlight illuminates one character in the center of it - you can't even measure the production value of this well-conceived tribute to the Hollywood musical.  Though a lot of stylized films miss the mark, this one hits the bullseye.  I often grow frustrated with modern movie musicals whose songs are forgotten before even walking out of the theater.  Days after seeing this film, I can clearly recall Justin Hurwitz's simple musical themes that stick with you far beyond the closing credits.   \"La La Land\" is a true musical triumph, and the genre of choice is jazz.  Much like in 2014's \"Whiplash,\" director Damien Chazelle has found a way to make jazz accessible to modern audiences.  Ryan Gosling's monologue about jazz pinpoints the experience of hearing it live and reflects the passion of true jazz fans; meanwhile the jazz-infused musical theater songs keep the thematic genre at the center of the film.  In a weak Oscar class, \"La La Land\" soars beyond the competition and is a shoe-in for Best Picture (unless the culturally relevant statements of \"Moonlight\" manage to steal it away).  While many of the technical aspects make the film shine, its heart lies in its believable characters.  Emma Stone delivers her most impassioned performance since \"Birdman\" with her phone audition and I believe that she has the Oscar in the bag.  Her singing has a soft, light quality that properly suits her character and her chemistry with Gosling drives the film from musical number to musical number.  I also appreciate that Gosling did all of his own piano playing for this film, which adds to the realism of his character.  The casting of John Legend was really clever in that it incorporated a pop culture icon who sings with excellent vocal technique.  I believe that the screenplay will win an Oscar, though I would have enjoyed a little more humor.  I can also see it winning Oscars for Director, Cinematography, Film Editing, and Score.  My main complaint about the film is its ending, which reflects Hollywood ideals over what we would expect to happen.  I'm still worked up about it, though this emotional response is a testament to its effectiveness.  \"La La Land\" is the complete package.  It is destined to win several of the technical Oscar categories and is the only film that will leave me shocked if it does not win Best Picture.  If you haven't seen this one yet, you need to.

            "content": "Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone co-star in Damien Chazelle's written and directed film, LA LA Land. Stone is Mia, a barista that is auditioning at every chance she can hoping to make it big as an actress. Gosling is Sebastian, a musician with dreams of grandeur who hopes to own his own Jazz club. If this does not sum up La and the millions that live there not much else will. The film does not have much plot beyond the blooming romance between the two leads, and their aspirations to make it big.\n\nThere is no question that musicals do not come along as frequently as they used to and amazing ones such as West Side Story and Sound of Music are even more uncommon. It is quite clear that Hollywood is still clamoring for this genre to remain afloat and do well as nearly any musical made anymore is Oscar nominated and this one is no exception.  If there was any doubt from the trailers that LA LA Land was a musical, the film does not waste a second and it instantly opens up with a musical interlude of people singing and dancing as they sit in rush hour traffic. The two leads are seen and interact rudely, but it is clear they do not know each other. We soon learn that Emma Stone is a barista that is going through auditions and she is one of the countless others that hopes to become an actress. After a few songs and moments there is a shift to Gosling's character. He is a struggling pianist that has strong love and interest in Jazz and only wants to associate with those who share this feeling. He dreams of opening his own club to prove that Jazz is not a dying art form. He stands in his own way and despite his talent he finds himself only doing gigs he believes are beneath him. After his introduction, the two randomly encounter again, without much progress. Apparently, LA is not so big after all since only during a third encounter 30 minutes into the film do we get a character name and a budding romance.\n\nA great musical uses song to embellish the feelings of characters while simultaneously drives the plot forward in an artistic manor. This film fails to do this, as most of the songs seem as if they are placed to remind you that indeed this is a musical so let's insert a song here why not. None of the songs are particularly memorable and there is not much choreography aside from assuring that the two main characters move in unison. One of best scenes of the film is when a friend convinces Goslings character that that Jazz is dying. The reason for this is that those who love it are holding onto the traditional greats (Monk, Powell, Parker) and advancement of the great music must come from letting the music evolve and not cling to the traditional sound. His agreement to let himself go and become a successful sellout was an interesting comment. \n\nAs the film goes on, it becomes more clear that what LA LA Land is trying to accomplish more so than anything else is be a microcosm of the modern LA. Text must be used to tell and remind the audience the time of year and its season because it is always Sunny in LA. The beginning of the film is like a new comer to LA, as there is the glitz, glamour, bright and vivid colors, song, dance, and plenty of history to go around. Once the charm wears off, behind it all there are simply just people with normal jobs struggling and hoping it to make it big. Through this struggle there is always doubt and moments of despair. Under this limelight, I began to enjoy the film significantly.  If, however this was indeed the film's intent, then more commentary on the people only talking with each other to better their chances for success would be warranted. Indication that even great talent or hope does not lead to success would have been more welcome than the happy go lucky traditional ending. LA LA land seduces you into believing it is a great musical and although I was entertained, it is clearly not to the extent that movie critics and Hollywood itself was. \n\n-2.22.2017",

What brought the movie down? And all this thinking made me realise something. Damien Chazelle is an artist. No ordinary artist, he's categorised into the ever-lasting genius section. The movie kept me captivated all throughout, so there was no time to check my phone. To be honest, I didn't even realise that I needed to urgently pee until after the movie. The whole choreography of the movie had me utterly speechless. Chazelle's use of one-takes (long shots) are impeccable. You see, long shots are usually boring (for example, watch Birdman, the movie that's infamously known to have no jump cuts), but in every scene there was just something interesting happening, whether it be in the background, or just the facial expressions of the extremely talented Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. I applaud both the stars on their dedication to learn such difficult parts and making the characters simply flow on screen. Gosling had to learn piano and the style of waltz while Stone's on screen appearance makes any movie worth the watch. The musical numbers were beautiful and unique, each too beautiful to forget. I'm humming the songs as I'm writing this! Hats off to Justin Hurwitz for the wondrous soundtrack. For me, however, what makes a movie is the way the story is told, and La La Land is like no other when it comes to this. If you strip the whole movie down, it's a simple boy-meets-girl love story. But once you add the lighting, music, dancing, special effects etc. you're caught up in this world of make-believe that you, oh so wish was real. It leaves you with a goofy feeling in your heart that maybe everything will be okay one day. You start singing like Mia (Emma Stone), and dancing like Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), which made me mad, of course, as I'm good at neither. And so, zooming in to me as I'm walking home, I realised that there was nothing missing from this movie. It left me mesmerised, yet mad. How can a movie be so great? It can be, and La La Land is.",

            "content": "La La Land is one of best reviewed, most lauded, and most loved movies of 2016. It has already won several awards and is very likely to win more. It received 14 Oscar nominations, tying the record set by All About Eve (1950), though All About Eve's 14 nominations was done with fewer categories, which seems slightly more impressive. La La Land is the front runner to take home the Best Picture Oscar. Let's get one thing straight: I like La La Land. I might even really like it, but I did not love it, at least not the way everyone else did.\u00a0\n\nThe plot is simple enough: Struggling jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) meets and falls for aspiring actress Mia (Emma Stone). Together they sing and dance through some of the loveliest scenes of Los Angeles on film. This is a side of L.A. not often seen movies. The center of American filmmaking is most often the setting of action and crime movies or it is meant to be a nonintrusive background. In La La Land, Los Angeles is stylized and romanticized. It is a city of purple sunsets, cool, blue nights, and hills and canyons and highways for song and dance numbers. I would not say that Los Angeles is a character because sets aren't characters, but it is at the forefront of La La Land. \n\nIt's no surprise that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have good chemistry; this is their third movie together after all. Each does a fine job in their respective roles. They sing and dance well enough, though they sing and dance like nonprofessionals that have been taught specific, not too challenging choreography. Each has a signature song: Sebastian has the melancholy \"City of Stars\" and Mia's \"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)\" serves as the film's climax. Both songs have been nominated for the Original Song Oscar.\n\n\nLa La Land takes place in a daydream world and writer-director Damien Chazelle seeks to transport the audience to this wonderful musical world. He succeeds, to a point. La La Land is meant to be a loving, enthusiastic tribute to the musicals of the 1950's and 40's. The misstep it makes is this: instead of taking inspiration from the great musicals of the past to create a new, fresh take, it simply lifts from and imitates those films instead. Action and science fiction are the genres most often criticized for being derivative, but musicals can be derivative too. There are numerous visual references to other musicals (enough for a side by side video comparison). Some are indirect: the bold, bright color pallet of costumes and sets is reminiscent of the musicals of Jacques Demy. Others are more direct: Gosling jumps up on a lamppost just like Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain. Unfortunately, since I've already seen most of the movies La La Land references (Jacques Demy's Umbrellas of Cherourg, Young Girls of Rochefort; Fred Astaire musicals: Shall We Dance, The Band Wagon, Funny Face; and, most of all, Singin' in the Rain, An American in Paris, and every other Gene Kelly musical), subtly and not so subtly, it comes off less as a tribute and more as a hollow imitation.\n\nThere's a lot to like in La La Land. It's a nice story about aspiring performers falling in love and trying to achieve their dreams. From the pink and purple sunsets to Stone's bright, yellow dress, La La Land is filled with bold and vibrant solid colors that cannot help but catch the eye. The songs are pleasant and enjoyable, even if you don't like jazz (and I don't). Some of the musicals numbers are very visually appealing-I'm thinking of Sebastian and Mia's dance at the observatory specifically-but others never open up to be as grand as I was expecting. The opening number plays like generic tableau of what someone that hasn't seen a musical thinks a musical is like. I suppose I just can't help but be reminded of the classic musicals with undeniably better performers and songs and wonder why I'm not just watching one of those again. I didn't get the feeling of unabashed joy and love and wonder that I get whenever I watch Truffaut's Day For Night, Gene Kelly's Singin' in the Rain, or even Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous (all about performers in the entertainment business). But still, I enjoyed this movie.",

For anyone who has been to LA for an audition, or even secretly wished to go try it out, its all lovingly shown here with a kindly romantic glow.\n\nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone lived this tale, and it has their fingerprints and their vibrance all over it. Moving and thoughtful, sparkly with plenty of flashy smarts and pizzazz.\n\nIf you catch the fever, you will be thoroughly transfixed as I was.\n\n5 freeway dance numbers out of 5",

The music, the dancing, the direction, the photography, top notch! Moments like Emma Stone auditioning for roles I found to be quite funny (although my wife didn't get it at all) considering I'm in film and I have been in those rooms. But what made for a great opening sequence was quickly followed up with great direction around a very cliched filled script that was telegraphed the moment we saw the coffee shop scene in the first act. I didn't care about the main characters falling in love, I didn't care about the songs they sang, and I didn't care where they ended up at all. I didn't cry at the last montage sequence before the end and I just saw massive flaws of logic in character developments. This again is a film where Hollywood celebrates itself even tho no one actually cares about films these days (especially because of Netflix). This being a fantasy film about love really plays up the fantasy when they're \"filming a big movie on the Warner Bros. lot.\" The fantasy here is they're filming something in LA, where we all know they move to Vancouver or Toronto to shoot everything these days. Why people are lusting after this film I have no idea.",

Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were top notch and carried this movie through to the end. The music was so good I even created a playlist to revisit it again and again (I mean it's jazz, so good). I was in awe of the cinematography but this is much to be expected from Damien Chazelle as his previous works are all cinematography masterpieces. \r\n\nThis leads us to the story\u0085 I found it hard to put into words exactly why the story was so lacking and disjointed from how great everything else about the movie was. I have been reading both the highest praises and lowest blows given to this movie and none of them mention the story or more importantly the relationship between Emma Stone's Mia and Ryan Gosling's Sebastian. The setup is great, struggling actress meets struggling artist over and over and they seemingly fall in love. Only their career aspirations and dreams of the future pull them apart. Tragic right? Well, the tragic moments seem to be \runending and this is where the story jumps the rails. While their love seemed real there is a fatal turning point where Emma basically squashing Ryan's dream and encourages him to go against his own desires (The only motivation for this moment appears to be to move the plot along, it felt so disingenuous to the characters). When Emma is presented with Ryan's feelings she flip-flops and blames Ryan\u0085 All the while Ryan's love for Emma keeps him pushing Emma to achieve her dream to which she was all too willing to give up on. This all seems very anti-woman, it portrays them both as having weak character but it shades Emma's character as the weaker of the two. Even in the end, it hits her when she is already down. As if the audience didn't already think this movie was a tragedy it doubles down. Not only could they have the career aspirations they both sought so highly after, enough to disregard the love they had for each other, but if they just would have stuck it out it would have ended in beautiful bliss by giving them their hard earned cake and letting them eat it too. The tragedy already portrayed before the ending of the film was enough for this 'reveal' at the ending to not move me at all. I was happy to see the credits so I could go download the soundtrack and move on.",
