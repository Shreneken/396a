            "content": "A brilliant neo-Western for the ages.\n\nDirector David Mackenzie's neo-Western crime drama Hell or High Water (2016) remains the best Western film of the past decade to me. His haunting shots, darker characterizations, brutal sudden violence, quiet tension, flawed heroes, and desperate villains ensure Hell or High Water is truly suspenseful. I continue to find Mackenzie's direction utterly riveting. Editor Jake Roberts' sleek cuts and steady pacing makes Hell or High Water's 102 minutes feel like a brief moment in time.\n\nWriter Taylor Sheridan's story is interesting and original with deep character studies of these four main men. Sheridan's realistic writing gives each man believable motives for how they act and think besides their backstories that make each guy unique. I just keep thinking about how he separates men by their choices as every guy could potentially get desperate enough for cash to rob a bank in Sheridan's world. Hell or High Water's true grit brings the heat in the unforgiving red Sunlight of Texas.\n\nCinematographer Giles Nuttgens finds fascinating framing for cars speeding down the desolate highways or men facing each other down in tense personal close-up shots. Hell or High Water is full of vast wide expanses of oil fields, gas stations, casinos, banks, and diners. Nuttgens shoots these stunning wide shots with sweeping wide shots and visceral close-ups that hang onto these hardened men. You never know when they'll just make a snide remark or get up and fight a man like Chris Pine defending his brother at the gas station from an angsty metalhead in a green sports car. Hell or High Water makes Texas look desolate and lonely.\n\nChris Pine is amazing as neo-Western villain Toby Howard. His smart, cautious, charming, and suddenly vicious bank robber is fascinating. Hell or High Water is Chris Pine's best acting performance ever. I wish he got an Oscar for Best Actor for his gritty turn as Toby Howard. He's ready for a fight, but actively trying to avoid violence and confrontation, whether it's with security guards or ex-wives. Pine feels thoughtful with an inner burden and sorrow that he's carrying around with him. Marin Ireland is pretty and great as Pine's ex-wife Debbie Howard. Her worn down expressions imply how tired and sick of Toby's lack of child support payments or fathering his sons. Her scene is memorable.\n\nBen Foster is absolutely unhinged as the violent bank robber and ex-con Tanner Howard. He feels dangerous and ready to pounce on anyone who threatens him. He'll feel disdain for his mother, hate for his father, loyalty to his brother, and even charm a casino clerk girl. Foster delivers a fierce co-lead performance unlike any of his acting work since his ungodly gunslinger Charlie Parker in 3:10 to Yuma. His machine gun volley sets flying a hail of bullets on the highway to detract the local posse and state rangers hunting him. It's terrifying and exhilarating like Val Kilmer firing his machine gun in Heat during the legendary bank robbery sequence. His sniper rifle farewell scene is outstanding and fearsome.\n\nJeff Bridges is subtle in his understated supporting role as elderly Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton about to retire. Bridges is funny with his smart wit, revolting with his casual racism, intelligent with his shrewd criminal insights, and cool with his fatal sniper fire and suspenseful final confrontation. Jeff Bridges was born to be in Westerns and totally earned his Oscar nomination for Hell or High Water. He should have won.\n\nGil Birmingham is sympathetic as Texas Ranger Alberto Parker, who has to take his partner's racist remarks against Native Americans in stride in order to hunt down bank robbers. He feels professional and by the book with an amiable attitude. You really care about this guy Alberto. Gil Birmingham should be appreciated more for Hell or High Water as I think he's often overlooked simply because Jeff Bridges just outshined him with a gripping character study right next to him. Gil's monologue about Native ancestry and banks taking money is fabulous and understated. You never suspect his ending is coming.\n\nAmber Midthunder is wonderful in her cameo as the pretty shaken Vernon Bank teller who gets robbed. Midthunder is lovely in Hell or High Water and feels authentic with her quiet teller, nervous with every carefully chosen word. I'm overjoyed that since Hell or High Water, Amber Midthunder has starred in Legion and Prey. Screenplay author Taylor Sheridan himself cameos as the cowboy herding cattle away from a brushfire by the highway.\n\nKaty Mixon is excellent as the Vernon waitress Jenny Ann, who flirts with Chris Pine and refuses to give Jeff Bridges her $200 tip as evidence because it is half of her mortgage. Dale Dickey is very nice as the blunt bank teller Elsie at the Howard brothers' first bank robbery in Hell or High Water. She tries talking them down in an unexpected dialogue. Kevin Rankin is good at the Texas Midlands bank account manager Billy Rayburn, who hates what the banks did to the Howard family.\n\nCanadian actress Melanie Papalia is very sexy and sweet as the nameless hooker in the casino, who flirts with Chris Pine. Margaret Bowman is a riot as the rude T-Bone Waitress that does not take any flack. William Sterchi's agreeable bank manager Mr. Clauson is a fun bit. Alma Sisneros is very cute as the affectionate clerk who sleeps with Foster's Tanner.\n\nProduction designer Tom Duffield creates little diners, quaint small town bank layouts, and dusty wooden Texan homes. Art director Steve Cooper highlights barren plains with few grasses or animals except the metallic beast of oil rigs blackening the horizon. Set decorators Wilhelm Pfau, Scott Christopher Clark, James Duddy, and Chris Painter put financial papers in the banks, hearty steak meals in the diners, and just piles of clothes and beer in the houses to keep with that impoverished aesthetic. It all looks very grounded and realistic. Visual effects artists Dave Kim, Eric A. Kohler, and Dane Allan Smith create a massive fire in the distance, an explosive car bomb, furious gunfire, and a bloody sniper rifle headshot for Hell or High Water with total realism.\n\nComposers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis create these charming and sullen folk tunes for Hell or High Water's sorrowful soundtrack. Nick Cave's lyrics bring a melancholy to his sonic Americana. I love the mournful tone to Cave and Ellis' Hell or High Water soundtrack. Sound designer Frank Gaeta lets the gunshot break the quiet small town silence with louds bursts of fire that echo out into noisy chaos.\n\nCostume designers Malgosia Turzanska, Leila Heise, and Jane Day rustle up ranger uniforms, blue jeans as far as the eye can see, and every ten gallon cowboy hat in Texas for Hell or High Water's striking rustic fashion. All the shirts have nice designs or style for Chris Pine and Ben Foster's outfits, while Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham's ranger fits humorously match each other. Make-up artists Janeen Schreyer, Tarra D. Day, and Karla Muenze give each guy long, unkempt hair and gruff facial hair for a hardened look. The actors must all have grown their hair just for Hell or High Water's tough guy aesthetic.\n\nIn all, Hell or High Water is sad, exciting, and often funny with its brazen bank robbers and quirky rangers on the chase in a deadly game of cat and mouse. I simply adore this gritty neo-Western.",

Hell or High Water explores the slowly rotting corpse of small town America and the changing tide of cops vs. robbers. Thematically speaking, this is a less effective No Country for Old Men. It is gripping in its action and dialogue and Jeff Bridges steals every scene he is in. I think a lot of people view Chris Pine as just another good looking actor guy, but I'm consistently impressed by him in the right roles, and man he's good in this one. It's pretty easy wax poetically about the headier aspects of this movie, but when it all comes down to it, it's just a cool movie: something that every good western needs to be.",

The plot is also pretty realistic and ends up creating several thought-provoking themes. The characters were also done pretty well, mainly due to the incredible cast behind them. The soundtrack felt fitting for the whole atmosphere for the movie, and the cinematography was done extremely well to give it the Texan atmosphere. There is also a number of thrilling moments that keep you on the edge of your seat, and the third act provides a wild, action-filled conclusion.

It has a short runtime for a movie and it even felt shorter due to how much I was enjoying the movie. Chris Pine, Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham all put on showstopping performances. The relationships between the two brothers of Pine and Foster as well as the two cops looking for them in Bridges and Birmingham are very well presented and you can feel the chemistry oozing of the screen.\n\nI love how they showed the intentions these robbers had and that the film took time to delve deep into the lives of the robbers. By the end you are wanting all the characters to live and find resolutions. It isnt towards a climatic breaking point near the end until you can really say you hope they get caught and I love that about this film. I thought that the humor was really authentic and well placed in the film and while it was funny it didn't take from the overall drama the film had nor the story. \nI felt so many different pieces of this film worked and felt cohesive. I love how small scale and grounded this film felt and that the filmmakers took the time to make the story actually make sense. A lot of times you watch dramas and you can't relate and feel a disconnect from what is happening in some scenes. No scene in this film broke my connection to the characters. The thrilling aspects near the end of the film ramp it up to 11 and it's very moving and engaging.",

The acting overall is also great; I haven't really seen a weak link anywhere. The story is gripping enough to keep me interested throughout the entire movie, and the ending is as perfect as it could have been, in my opinion. Nothing extreme, but rather grounded and realisitc. You have two unlikeable characters trying to be stopped by other two unlikeable characters and somehow, you like all of them. This is when a movie really clinks for me, and this one sure did. Ben Foster's character is this hardened criminal, who has done it all, and acts without really thinking much of any consequences, and mostly does it for himself, when Chris Pine's character is the exact opposite of that, he has never killed someone, he never acts outside of what he has planned, and he does it for his family.

It is a tale of two very different brothers that share a common bond and two very different Texas rangers that share a common bond as well.  It's driven by its narrative, not by violent action.  Even though I found it to be sleepy at times, it's still a fine film I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.  \"Hell or High Water\" is a brutally honest expose about the lengths through which people go to demonstrate their fealty and the bonds that develop between men who share a similar endpoint.  If you long for shots of wide open spaces, conflict and resolution then this movie is ripe for the picking.",

            "content": "Jeff Bridges has made a career out of playing genial, likable slackers with a surprising amount of depth and hurt behind their seemingly complacent facades. I wouldn't call him my favorite actor, I think that the affection many have for his public persona cause them to overrate his abilities but he is right at home in a minimalist western like this one and his grizzled presence brings about a Larry McMurtry-esque tone. I wasn't totally infatuated with the film as I felt that it covers similar ground to many other westerns that go deeper in their exploration of poverty's effect on families and the importance of father figures. Fans of the genre should rejoice in finding a film that actually has something to say as opposed to The Magnificent Seven (2016).\n\nDowntrodden Texan Toby Howard, Chris Pine, is divorced from his wife Debbie, Marin Ireland, and estranged from his children. He wants to ensure that they will be financially secure in the future and wants to continue to own the ranch that his mother left him after her death but a mortgage from a cruel local bank makes this difficult. In order to finance his ambitions he teams up with his loose cannon brother Tanner, Ben Foster, to carry out robberies of various local banks and later launder their money through a casino before depositing the money in the bank that plans to take their ranch away from them. Chasing them is aging Ranger Marcus Hamilton, Jeff Bridges, who keeps up a friendly rapport with his partner Alberto Parker, Gil Birmingham, while considering his impending retirement and ability to do his job successfully. Tanner's volatile personality leaves the brothers vulnerable and even as they begin to pay off their debts they have serious doubts about their ability to stay alive.\n\nWhere the film excels is in capturing the poverty of the area subtly as it is never overplayed but there is a desperation to all of the characters that is driven by their economic concerns. Director David Mackenzie allows the camera to linger on tagging around the various small towns that the brothers pass through that gives the sense that people there have nothing to live for and no real way to express their outrage. For the brothers we understand that this ranch is what little they have left and to them the bank, an institution that could take their only remaining asset away from them, is a major enemy. The inhabitants of these small Texan towns also seem wary of institutions as they are not forthcoming with information about the robbers for the police. In one fascinating scene a sweet waitress refuses to give up $200 given to her by the robbers because it is the only thing that will allow her to pay her mortgage. We are left to imagine how her and countless other struggling men and women get by without miraculous donations such as this one.\n\nThere is also the usual infatuation with the big skies and flat plains of the Texan landscape and while the film never quite reaches the level of Hud (1963) in how beautifully open and natural the area is at night Giles Nuttgens tries his hardest to imitate James Wong Howe. Foster and Pine give fine performances as two brothers trying to make their way in the world as they don't over do the accents, i.e. Kenneth Branagh in The Gingerbread Man (1998), and imbue their characters with varying degrees of intensity. Foster is known at this point for his manic performances as men angry at the world whether it be in Alpha Dog (2007) or Ain't Them Bodies Saints (2013) and he replicates his act to good effect here as he is believably unhinged. Pine was more of a question mark heading into the film as he is best known for his role in Star Trek (2009) and had not been known as an actor of dramatic heft by this point. He is a compelling lead as while he might be a little too glamorous to be believable in the role he is restrained and contemplative enough to successfully play off of his showy counterparts.\n\nThe film is worth a watch because while it may not necessarily have spoken to me that strongly because I don't love westerns it boasts more than the average genre film.",

No, me either, until I realized that's exactly what I was watching... Story about two bank robbing brothers, Tanner and Toby Howard, raising enough cash to keep the bad bank man from taking the farm. Ya see, they struck oil on that land, not much, but enough to get by. Toby is the smart one, doing bad things for good reasons. Tanner is the wild card, doing bad things just to do bad things, but deep down, doing it for his brother! But coming up quick behind them is the law, Texas Ranger kinda law!! The old sheriff, Marcus Hamilton, just about to retire, and through pretty much intuition alone ends up in the right places at the right times, and with Marcus his Native American partner, Alberto, who is assaulted by the racist humor of the sheriff all day, but deep down, there's a bromance going on! And as Tanner and Toby continue their bank robbing ways, Tanner gets a little cocky takes on a bank full of people, shots fired, they barely escape with their lives, the townsfolk round up an armed posse to go after them chasing them up the road, but right around the corner is the sheriff, because deep down he knew where those pesky Howard boys were gonna strike next leading up to the ultimate showdown between the Texas Rangers and a couple of law breaking cowboys!! So this takes place in modern day, but it had the classic western set up. So if you're looking for a modern day western, go for it, looking for Heat, or Point Break, i'd say probably not.

Jeff Bridges is basically playing himself, but that works to great effect. Very good, well paced with good cinematography and great dialogue.",

I'm a West Texas native and I can count so many Texas sheriffs, Rangers, DPS, city and county cops who are exactly like him.  Not a fan of Ben Foster.   He just didn't fit the role.  Nor did Chris Pine.  I thought it was a good twist on an old theme, but it felt and looked jumpy, as if there was too much to fit into a short time frame.  As the plot unfolds, we catch a glimpse of why the brothers are robbing banks, but it just didn't catch me in a way I thought it would.  The ending was hacky.  I doubt seriously the Ranger could have made that shot from the position he was in.  And the very end, the confrontation, over done I think.  I understand some lawmen can't let go of the job, and I understand the motive of the Jeff Bridges character of wanting revenge for the death of his partner, however, the shooting on the mountain was a bit too cut and dried, and the confrontation at the end seem strained and forced at best.  At worst, It's a convenient vehicle for the viewer to guess what may or may not happen next.  ",

I'm not much of a fan of westerns typically, but there's an energy to Hell or High Water that kept me totally engaged.  That's not to see it betrays it's genre for an action movie trope or something, it's still moody and atmospheric in it's western tropes, it's more in the spirit of the film, the heartbeat of the film that the energy comes through more than any action on screen.  There are no real heroes, no real villains, and a grim and ugly look that is still beautiful in every frame.  I really liked it.",

As an Oklahoman myself, I know about 10 different guys who act just like his character. Typically you may look at his portrayal as a little over the top, but I think he nailed it. \n\nThe movie was the right amount of tense, drama, and interesting.

As yin-yang siblings compelled to embark upon their mission by need, fury, and inherent recklessness, Pine and Foster share a compelling chemistry.

As the just-about-to-retire sheriff hot on their trail, Bridges delivers one of his finest performances, radiating both wit and regret as an old-school relic cop.

            "content": "Strengths: The relationship between the brothers is the thing that this film excels the most. Chris Pine (Toby Howard) gives what is arguably the best performance of his career. He's likable and plays well off his brother. Ben Foster (Tanner Howard) is almost unrecognizable as his ex-con brother. He might be the show stealer, playing an unhinged man who is hell bent on helping his brother, even if it means sacrificing himself. Jeff Bridges (Marcus Hamilton) is his usual great self. There's a sense that he's kind of a jerk, but there's heart behind what he does. The bank robbery scenes are well done without going over the top. The tense scenes, like Toby getting stopped at a roadblock or his conversation with Marcus at the end of the film are both brilliantly handled. There's not a lot of effects used, but when we do get them, it looks great. There's a specific gunshot that looks phenomenal late in the movie. The direction is top notch and the script allows for some deep moments among the characters.\n\nWeaknesses: The plot is ultimately very simple and straightforward. It's not a flat out bad thing, but it shines a light on the fact that this movie could mean more if things were laid out a bit differently. Along with that, some of the characters are kind of stereotypical and not fully fleshed out. We have the father trying to do right by his kids, the raging ex-con, etc. Another issue is some of the pacing. Points of the movie seem to drag. \n\nOverall: Once you get past some pacing problems and some of the simple stuff, you find yourself watching a well-acted, engaging film with some great emotional beats.",

And I guess paying the bank off with their own money would make it more interesting? I don't know. It's never even clear who planned this whole fiasco.\n\nThe characters aren't much better. Tanner and Toby are cardboard cutouts painted with stereotypes. Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is nothing more than a rehash of every sheriff in every Western ever filmed. Except with more mumbling. The only remotely interesting character was Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), and he is criminally underdeveloped and underutilized.\n\nSpeaking of Alberto - his death is unearned and feels cruel. Maybe that was the intention, but it leaves the viewer with a bad taste. The fact that Marcus, who spent the entire movie mumbling racist jokes at his good-natured partner, hardly even seems phased makes the circumstance even worse.\n\nThe best part of Hell or High Water is the commentary on the changing way of life and how that affects people in the poorer parts of the United States. Toby has an excellent quote towards the end of the movie about how being poor is like a disease, and it infects and corrupts generations of people.\n\nOverall, Hell or High Water is a film with good ideas and intentions but, ultimately, falls flat on the execution and presentation.",

For them, the hold-ups are just part of a last-ditch scheme to take back a future that seemed to have been stolen from under them. Justice seems to be theirs, until they find themselves on the radar of Texas Ranger, Marcus (Jeff Bridges) looking for one last grand pursuit on the eve of his retirement, and his half-Comanche partner, Alberto (Gil Birmingham). As the brothers plot a final bank heist to complete their scheme, and with the Rangers on their heels, a showdown looms at the crossroads where the values of the Old and New West murderously collide.\n\nThis was an interesting film. It has been two years since this movie has come out and considering it garnered a lot of buzz at the Oscars (which I don't care about), I'm surprised it took me this long to watch it. It's just been sitting on my shelf for a while now and just until recently, I hadn't plopped it into my Xbox One. Then, my friend came over and we decided to watch \"Hell or High Water\" on one of our many movie nights. It was a really solid ride overall, even if I may not have fully been able to appreciate it the first watch-through. \n\nOne thing fantastic about this film was the talent. Chris Pine and Ben Foster really took charge and put on great performances in this film. Their overall talent and ability to work together gave something very interesting. However, am I the only one who saw them and thought of Sam and Dean Winchester? I don't know why, as they didn't necessarily match those same personas, but I just thought of those two. Anyways, the characters they played were characters with opposing personalities, which gave them a lot of clash, but a lot of work well also. \n\nOverall, I felt like this movie was just really tense. It wasn't necessarily this adrenaline pumping thing, nor was it slow. It was in the middle, setting up its scenes with these really deep, intellectual conversations and moments. Especially the ending, I really enjoyed a lot of the moments in this film that spoke so much without necessarily saying a lot. \n\nIn the end, \"Hell or High Water\" was a solid film with some great moments. It had great cinematography, great acting, solid characters, and a good story ark. Overall, a solid watch.",

The themes that paint the narrative range from right to conceal and carry, to the dichotomy of big city Wall Street to small town Main Street. Posing questions but allowing the audience to come up with there own answers. I think 10 different people could see the movie 10 different ways and all enjoy it.\n\nIt's, far and away, Chris Pine's best performance as a leading role.  All of the characters are uniquely human with these wonderful lines of ambiguity. Sure, Pine robs banks, but he is in touch with his morality and even burdened with guilt, and Ben Foster is most definitely a villain but he has such love for his brother. And Jeff Bridges! God love the good ole cowboy hat wearing, mushy-mouthed Jeff Bridges. Fully devoted to and talented at his job but again, not without his own flaws.  His relationship with his partner, Gil Birmingham, is one of my favorite aspects of the film, and its culmination turns the grumpy \"I'm too old for this shit\" trope on its ears. They get along but probably wouldn't if they weren't partners. Bridges is a bit difficult to be around, but he shows love and respect in a certain way, and it's the only way that he knows how.  Even the superb performances of the bit players gives the setting such an authenticity. Having grown up in Texas I feel like I've met many of the supporting characters (for better or worse).\n\nHell or High Water also makes such great use of the emptiness of west Texas. Everything is timed and paced and laid out so well that there are periods of time that highlight how boring open space can be, then jolts you to life with these crime scenes that are reminiscent of Michael Mann's Heat.",

The soundtrack by Warren Ellis and Nick Cave adds dramatically to the effect alongside a well-chosen selection of country twang that fits the West Texas setting.   The plot unfolds slowly with an easy-going air of simplicity.  Two brothers (Ben Foster and Chris Pine) are robbing banks to raise some money for an unknown reason. Two Texas Rangers are tracking them (Gil Birmingham and Jeff Bridges).  The film takes the time to show us their relationships in enough detail so that we see their differing personalities.  But the overall effect is of patient and economic storytelling. Director David Mackenzie (although a Brit) captures the despondent ethos of the local area, where banks and their greed have helped to create and perpetuate poverty and anger.  Eventually, we find out the motivation for the younger brother (Pine), even as we realise that the older brother (Foster) is a psychopath.  Bridges and Birmingham don't have too much to do except to exchange (loving) insults.  Yet, the result is watchable and rewarding on a sort of primeval level, even if the film doesn't have too much to say didactically. (An interview with the director and cast suggests they were trying to present reality as ambiguous).  In the end, you probably wouldn't want to live there but it's a pleasure to absorb the mood for a couple of hours.",

They take the stolen money to an Indian casino in Oklahoma to be laundered. They exchange the stolen bills for chips, some of which Tanner uses to gamble. Toby then has the casino convert them into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank - the same bank they robbed. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired, the brothers head back to Texas.\nIt is revealed that the brothers' mother died recently, leaving their ranch in debt due to a reverse mortgage provided by the Texas Midlands Bank. If the debt is not paid off in a few days, the ranch will be foreclosed. Toby is determined to pay off the mortgage to ensure a comfortable life for his estranged sons because oil has recently been discovered on their land. They rob Texas Midlands as a form of frontier justice. Hamilton and Parker has to anticipate the next move of the thieves to catche them...\n\n\"Hell or High Water\" received critical acclaim, with many praising the film as revitalizing the western genre. Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, \"Hell or High Water offers a solidly crafted, well-acted Western heist thriller that eschews mindless gunplay in favor of confident pacing and full-bodied characters. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying, \"In ways large and small, Hell or High Water is a movie so beautiful and harsh and elegiac and knowing, the moment it was over was the moment I wanted to see it again.\" IGN reviewer Samantha Ladwig gave the film a 9/10, saying \"Hell or High Water surprises with its complex narrative, stuns with its cinematography, and makes up for this summer's shortcomings.\" Tom Stempel of Creative Screenwriting praised Hell or High Water as \"a fresh, smart, bank robbery-character study and one of the best screenplays so far this year.\" The film premiered at the Un Certain Regard section of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 12, 2016. It received critical acclaim and grossed $37 million. The American Film Institute selected it as one of its ten Movies of the Year, and it was nominated for numerous awards, including four Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Bridges), Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. It also received Golden Globe nominations for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Bridges and Best Screenplay.\n\n\"Hell or High Water\" is really nicely directed by David Mackenzie with great cinematography and editing, we get great performances from Pine and Foster as the leads, Bridges is however doing the same mumbling Texan type he did in \"True Grit\" and \"R.I.P.D.\" which is getting a bit tiresome as he is such a versatile great actor. The plotline with the \"bad guys\" (the bank in this case) and the \"good guys\" (Howard and his brother trying to save their childhood home ranch) is hardly unique, but the build up between the protagonists and the antagonists is the interesting part creating empathy and sympathy for the characters on both sides of the story. I like as well the homage to the western genre and it being a modern time western. And I also like the quite slow pacing that sometimes explode in mayhem and violence.",

David Mackenzie is no short on execution but doesn't seek attention and fails to utilize the script by Taylor Sheridan which frankly had more potential than it was projected. Jeff Bridges is straight out amazing along with a great cast like Chris Pine and Ben Foster who are giving their all in. Hell Or High Water is not the cure, its the disease that even though slowly but surely is taking away the essence (brilliant screenplay, stellar performances and even background score) out of it.",

Instead of the obvious he allows the actors to create their own tension by delving slowly deeper and deeper into the pressing question: Why on earth are they risking so much to rob this bank of small bills? Small, seemingly insignificant moments become monumental decisions. A brunch at a diner becomes a fork in the road when one of the brothers notices a branch of their despised bank across the road. Will they or won't they try to rob it in broad daylight? \n\nThe soundtrack, mostly country/rock ballads and guitar gems adds considerably to the experience.

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, is it true that someone told us to go to Hell?\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Only if Hell is a town in West Texas. Let s recap:\n\nSCOTT: We meet the Howard brothers, a pair of modern-day cowboys who have taken to robbing banks in west Texas. Toby (Chris Pine) is the younger brother, and Tanner (Ben Foster) is the older brother who has recently been released from prison. On their tail is a pair of Texas Rangers who want to put an end to the brothers  crime spree. The head Ranger is Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) who is nearing retirement, and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), a Native American who somehow tolerates Hamilton s racist banter.\n\nGREG: The brothers have a scheme to rob the Midland Bank of enough cash to pay off the debts of their mother s reverse-mortgaged ranch. The brothers are following Toby s plan, but Tanner is a loose cannon and strays from the plan. This leaves enough clues for Hamilton and Parker to predict their next heist. It s a game of cat and mouse as the Rangers close in on the brothers in a tight spiral.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, I ll just come right out and say it. Hell or High Water is one of the best movies of 2016. How refreshing it is for a film released in August to boast a rich and nuanced screenplay coupled with memorable and multidimensional characters. This movie held me in rapture, from the opening scene to the closing scene. The film opens with a bank robbery but in the background stands a church with three prominent crosses on the wall, foreshadowing the later deaths of three of this film s main characters. In the concluding scene, Hamilton moves away from the camera while the camera hits the dirt, suggesting that he is, in fact, the third casualty. This movie compels you to see things and to see people at a deeper level, a human level. The four main characters have an unusual strength and depth to them, a multi-dimensionality that I havent seen in the movies in years. Jeff Bridges didn t just portray a Texas Ranger; he was that Ranger. It s Oscar time for him, for sure. Every character inhabiting this film came alive on the big screen, made me laugh, made me cry, or repulsed me. The film is a true gem, a throwback to a bygone era of filmmaking when character development mattered.\n\nGREG: Part of the pleasure of this story is that it s a mystery. The mystery is: why are these cowboys robbing these banks? We re fed clues incrementally, just as the Texas Rangers discover them. So, despite the fact that we re following the brothers closely, we don t know the reasons why until nearly the third act. This is a great anti-villain story cut from the same cloth as Bonnie and Clyde and The Sting. The lead characters are villainous as they are on the moral high ground. In our book Reel Heroes & Villains we talk about anti-heroes. They take on the characteristics of villains but are the characters we are rooting for. Contrariwise, the Texas Rangers are anti-villains. That is, they are the good guys in the story, but are the antagonists for the leads. It s a great structure. But what makes this film work, more than anything else, is the depth of the characters portrayed. I had to do a double-take because I thought this might have been a Coen Brothers or Weinstein film (both producers of great character-based films). But no, this one was penned by veteran television writer Taylor Sheridan (Veronica Mars and Sons of Anarchy). I was blown away by the combination of action, suspense, and great character detail.\n\nSCOTT: You re so right, Greg. The hero s journeys are nontraditional, with the Howards voluntarily moving into the dangerous unfamiliar world while pulling the Rangers in with them. Tanner performs the ultimate (anti-) heroic act of sacrificing himself for the success of the mission, and Alberto does the ultimate heroic act of sacrificing himself, albeit involuntarily, for the success of the Rangers  mission. We have parallel anti-hero and hero stories with no real transformation, only adaptation to circumstances -- which can be considered a type of transformative adjustment heroes need for success. The mentoring is equally rich and unconventional. Older brother Tanner takes the physical lead role in being badass and anti-heroic, but it is his younger brother Toby who masterminds the entire caper. Among the Rangers, it is Marcus who mentors Alberto in the dress code and in doing detective work, but in the end it is Alberto s quiet dignity that exerts a great emotional impact on Marcus. Toby also plays an important mentoring role with his older son -- or, rather, an anti-mentoring role, as Toby cautions his son not to be like him. While the Rangers serve as anti-villain characters, it s also pretty clear that the biggest villain in this story is the institution of banking. In our most recent book we discuss how institutions can take on villainous roles. Usually these institutions are societal scourges such as racism or sexism. In this film the villainous institution is clearly the financial industry that conspires to squeeze every cent out of society s most innocent and vulnerable people. In doing their noble anti-villainous work, the Rangers encounter obstacles in the form of popular disdain for the banks that are being robbed. The robbers, in effect, take on folk-hero status. So the villain in this story, the banking industry, ends up hindering the anti-villains  ability to carry out their mission while having a slightly facilitative effect for the anti-hero brothers. In all it s a fascinating triad of anti-heroes, anti-villains, and institutional villain.\n\nGREG: Hell or High Water is a cleverly draw tail of modern-day anti-heroes. Everything in this film is excellent: the acting, the cinematography, the story, even the scenery. Often in the movies I m distracted by the execution of the  seams  of the standard plot points. But Hell kept me in suspense with it s unspoken mystery of why these brothers were robbing banks. I can t imagine anything that would have made this film better. I give it 5 out of 5 Reels and I expect an Oscar nomination for the film. The brothers are classic anti-heroes in that they are making morally wrong choices, but still we see them as heroes because they are subverting the evil banking institution. They are chased by the virtuous (if albeit cantankerous) Rangers as anti-villains, trying to thwart the brothers  goal of robbing the bank. In the end Tanner martyrs himself, which is a selfless act, but kills Ranger Parker in the process, cementing his anti-hero status. I give this hero structure 5 out of 5 Heroes. We re witness to some fine mentoring by the venerable Ranger Hamilton upon the younger Ranger Parker. Although Hamilton insults Parker, he lets us know that it s a friendly way of acknowledging and (in a strange way) respecting their differences. We also see cross-mentoring between brothers Toby and Tanner. Tanner advises Toby in the ways of bank robbing while Toby shares his intelligence and values with Tanner. It s wonderful mentoring throughout which I award 5 out of 5 Mentor points.  Movie:  Mentor:  Heroes: \n\nSCOTT: Ditto, ditto, ditto, Greg. By hell or high water, this movie had better garner some Academy Award nominations. This film is a true cinematic achievement and boasts the complete package -- a meaty script, memorable characters, marvelous acting, a socially relevant message, and a surprising twist or two in the closing act. Jeff Bridges is especially brilliant; I ll never forget his complex emotional reaction after his successful sniping of his prey. I have no hesitation in awarding the film the full 5 Reels out of 5 here. Our four main characters represent the finest combination of heroes and anti-heroes we ve seen in the movies in several years. As you ve noted, Greg, each pairing has its own unique dynamic of power, influence, and communication. The Howard brothers have a lifetime of chemistry to draw from, and the Rangers are in the process of developing theirs. In the end, there is an unshakeable bond within each pairing, and it s a true tragedy that only one of the four walks away the rubble of this tragic story. For giving us fabulous characters with moral complexity whom we can really sink our analytic teeth into, this ensemble easily merits a rating of 5 Heroes out of 5. We ve talked at length about the complex and nuanced mentoring that goes on within each buddy hero and anti-hero pairing. We re also treated to a rare episode of anti-mentoring going on between Toby and his son. The father-son relationship is actually the catalytic epicenter of the entire robbery spree. As with everything else in this film, the mentoring is exceptionally interesting and warrants a rating of the full 5 Mentors out of 5. Movie:  Mentor:  Heroes:",

However I cannot agree with the majority opinion here.  \"Hell or High Water\" is not a terrible movie by any means.  It's just mediocre.  Very mediocre.  It has a main story that is unoriginal and also very predictable.  It also makes no bones about ripping off other movies.  The scene where Toby Howard (Chris Pine) is speaking with his son and telling him that he does not want his son to live the same life as him was recycled right out of \"The Godfather\".  I was waiting for Toby to say he was hoping his son would have a career in politics.  The movie also recycles quite a bit from 1995's \"heat\" the scene where Toby gets past a roadblock with a fake driver's license is a good example for that.  I was looking for Ashley Judd in that scene.  The film's final scene recycles the diner scene from \"Heat\" as well.  The one positive thing to say about the movie is the very strong performances by Chris Pine and Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges.  They are what carry the movie for me.  I did not care for Ben Foster's performance as Waingro.  Wait.  I'm sorry.  I meant Tanner Howard.  His character was too cliched and formulaic for me.

The plot is about two brothers, the upstanding and law-abiding Toby (Chris Pine, Star Trek franchise), and the combustible ex-convict Tanner (Ben Foster, ) begin robbing bank branches in various quiet towns throughout the remote deserts of Texas to get money for a somewhat good cause. They are pursued by an elder Texas ranger near the end of his career, played brilliantly by Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Crazy Heart). The plan designed by the brothers is devilishly clever and their reason for breaking the law is something that everyone can understand and sympathise with, and the characters and their relationships are extremely enjoyable to watch as the film explores them. The film mixes some heart-warming and uplifting moments with some real heartless and tense scenes that keep you on your toes and guessing what's gonna happen next. Director David Mackenzie uses the arid and huge landscape to his advantage, and really captures the immense size and scale of the Lone Star State, and the relative emptiness of some of it. The film is great to look at, the story is as gripping and entertaining as any out there, and the performances are brilliant.

            "content": "In West Texas, two brothers go on a bank-robbing rampage.  They are targeting the branches of one bank in particular, The Texas Midland Bank.  This bank is about to foreclose on the mortgage on their ranch and claim the property, and robbing the bank to pay its own loan seems appropriate.  On the trail of the brothers is a Texas Ranger, Marcus Hamilton, with only a few weeks to retirement.\n\nInteresting idea, clumsily written and so-so in execution.  While the whole idea of robbing a bank to pay off a loan to that bank is wonderfully, wickedly poetic, here it is turned into a ideological, political sermon.  So rather than a decent crime drama, the movie gets turned into an attempt to be something bigger, and it fails at that, taking shots at things clearly troublesome to the writer, but not necessarily to anyone else.\n\nAdd in much fake atmosphere - mournful music, long shots of Texas vistas - just to make the movie seem more profound than it is, and you have case of style over substance.  It was as if director David MacKenzie was trying to emulate the Coen Brothers' Fargo, but then didn't have the story to go with the atmosphere.\n\nIt's not all bad though.  Jeff Bridges is great as Marcus Hamilton and there are a few good action scenes and funny moments.  I found the proliferation of guns a great, often funny, indictment of American gun culture.  Not sure it was meant to be that profound or funny though, as it was probably quite realistic.",

Jeff Bridges also put in a great performance as the pursuer of the bad guys whose character is mostly unlikable until tragedy hits and you realise it was all superficial.  However, for me the stand out performance was Chris Pine who for once was not playing Chris Pine!  He is a decent actor but I would struggle to pick out a performance that is so very different from the others until this one.

I can pick up on a little racism in the movie. It's subtle but it's there.\n\nI'm so glad Jeff Bridge's said we said about the man on the television preaching. I really enjoyed the political and government and religious statements and messages provided in this movie. It seems that Texas is obviously the worst state to rob from. Every motherfucker seems to have a gun and wants to be a hero. It's still the wild west over there in Texas I guess. At least the ranger avenged his partner.\n\nFunny how all the mess started because of banks and mortgages and owed money. Banks have always ruined people's lives and they continue to do so.

The cinematography and feel of this film reminded me of No Country For Old Men in all the best ways possible.\n\nNormally, plot holes and small continuity errors drive me crazy, but this movie was so much fun it just didn't matter to me.  In the third act it becomes apparent that the entire premise of the film is ludicrous, but it didn't bother me one bit.  I'll discuss it later in the spoilers section.  The last time I enjoyed a movie as much as this one that had so many plot problems was Denzel Washington's The Equalizer.  Once he and the terrorists started battling it out in the home center, I realized I was watching Die Hard In A Home Depot, and just relaxed and enjoyed myself.  To this day, I can't walk down any aisle in a Home Depot without noticing all the ways I could kill people with what is on the shelves.  \n\nAlso, if you ever find yourself needing to launder any money, PLEASE don't use this film as a \"how to\" guide.  You'll be in cuffs before you get out the door.\n\nSo, I really enjoyed Ben Foster's and Chris Pine's performances.  I've never really been a fan of Chris Pine's work, but he shows real range here in his understated performance, and he got the West Texas accent right!  The interplay between Pine's Toby and Foster's Tanner is well-written and excellently acted.  You'll believe they're brothers with a lifetime of love and hate and respect and torment between them.\n\nThe high point of the film though, is Jeff Bridges' Ranger Marcus, and the banter between him and his long-suffering, but subtly counterpunching Alberto, played with an understated brilliance by Gil Birmingham.  The older Bridges gets, the more interesting he gets, in my opinion, and this may well be his best.  If you enjoyed his interpretation of Rooster Gogburn in the remake of True Grit, you're gonna love him here!\n\nThere wasn't a bad performance in the film, and several of the bit players were amazing!  Katy Mixon's pragmatic waitress Jenny Ann was an absolute delight, and Margaret Bowman stole the show as the waitress at the T-Bone Steakhouse (guess what they serve there?).\n\nI also absolutely LOVED the way the film ended.  It had a little touch of Coen brothers, except you could understand it.  I'm not gonna say any more, I don't want to give even a bit of it away.\n\nI simply cannot understand how this film didn't do better at the box office.  I just punched myself in the face for not going to see it in the theater.\n\nSPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** \n\nSo, the primary premise early in the film is, the Texas Midland Bank screwed their mother on a reverse mortgage and is about to foreclose on it, so they're robbing Texas Midland branches, only so they can pay it off with Texas Midland money.  Great premise.  Frontier justice.  The little guy fights back against The Man.\n\nLater, we learn there's oil on the land, and Toby wants get this done to set his sons up Jed Clampett-style.  That kills the entire premise.  The oil on the land  opened up so many other ways they could have gotten the ranch out of hock that didn't involve robbing banks.\n\nThey could easily have negotiated an advance out of the oil company.  Even if the oil company decided to wait them out in the hope of getting a better deal from Texas Midland, they only needed a hundred grand.  They could easily have found a bank to take their future oil revenues from that deal as collateral on a loan, and if not, investors would have lined up around the block to do it.  \n\nSomeone I was discussing this said doing it my way wouldn't have given them the revenge they desired.  That's true, but Toby's primary motivation was to set his sons up.  Doing that without the risk of getting killed (and failing to set the boys up) is a much smarter play.  Then, with the boys playing around in their new Jethro Bodine cement pond, there's plenty of time (and funds) for revenge.\n\nYou know what?  I don't care.  The truth is, I don't think they even needed the whole oil thing.  If they'd just had  Toby and Tanner's mother leave the ranch to her grandsons, getting their birthright out of hock and getting revenge on the bank for screwing their Momma would have been more than enough motivation for the brothers; maybe even a better, more hard-bitten one.  Put Toby's sons living with their mother in a dilapidated trailer house and that ranch looks like a big step up.  Anyway, that's why I gave it to them.  It's a detail the rest of the story needs to work, and the rest of the story is so damned good I just don't care.\n\nThe next big hole is how they laundered the money through the casino.  I work in a casino, and I promise you, everybody with some money needin' a little washin' has thought of walking into a casino, buying a bunch of chips, waiting awhile, then cashin' 'em back out.  It would be spotted instantly.  You can't move anywhere near that kind of money through a casino with IDs being required.  Reports would be made.  There are cameras EVERYWHERE, and it's the first place law enforcement would look.  \n\nThey needed it to make the story work though, so I gave 'em a pass.  I look at it like going to a strip club and having a triple-D stripper with crossed-eyes coming up and offering me two-for-one table dances.  Let's just say I'm not going to be spending a lot of time looking at her eyes.\n\nThere's more.  Burying the stolen cars they used in the robberies is a guarantee of being caught.  You don't think the cops might have a question or two about that big, car-sized newly filled-in hole on the property at the heart of this?\n\nStill it was a neat visual, and it helped establish the amount of planning that went into what they were doing without taking up a whole lot of time, so again, I gladly give it to them.\n\nThey got all the big stuff right, so it's easy to give 'em a pass on the little stuff they got wrong.\n\nGreat movie!",

The movie is very good indeed in every cinematographic aspect.\nMarcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) is on the hunt after bank robbers, who occurred to be two brothers: Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby Howard (Chris Pine).\n\nTanner is a convict that was just recently released from prison for bank robbery. It turns out that he killed his father as a teen too. Tanner is a very impulsive man, who just likes the drive, adrenaline and fun that he receives by living a criminal life.\n\nToby on the other hand is a person that destroyed his own family, however he chose the path of redemption. He came up with a very wit plan that will allow him to guarantee a problem-free life for his kids and wife.\n\n?I would say whole movie is based on the evolution of relationship between two pairs: 1) Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker 2) Toby and Tanner Howard. They argue, joke and respect each other.\n\nSoundtrack is also marvelous. Original music is written by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis.\n\nSome may say that movie lacks something original moves in script. I completely disagree with this. Even if you do not see any surprises behind each turn the movie is not predictable and it has quite a few things to say about modern world and human nature.\n\nThe film is absolutely worth watching if you enjoy solid westerns about ordinary lives and not some glamorous empty trash.",

            "content": "Every now and then a movie comes out of nowhere that rises far beyond the usual conventions and limitations of its genre, and completely defies all expectations that might be placed on it. Hell or High Water Made is one of those movies. Made on an extremely modest budget, it tells the relatively straightforward tale of two small time bank robbers and the Texas Rangers chasing them. But it's as far above your average cops and robbers movie as the French Connection is above the standard buddy cop flick. \n\nThe robbers, down on their luck brothers Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), are as different as can be. Toby is a former family man, and the brains of the pair. He's soft spoken, has an obvious aversion to violence, and would never be doing any of this if he wasn't trying to save the family ranch from foreclosure. Toby, on the other hand, is the loose cannon. Brash, impulsive, and with a strong violent streak, he has a rap sheet a mile long and clearly enjoys every bit of what he's doing. \n\nThe brothers are no masterminds, but they're no dummies either. Inexperienced as they are, they know exactly what their doing, hitting the smallest banks with the least security, taking only the cash that's easily at hand, and splitting before the cops know what's happening. They're also smart enough to know that they can't keep this going for long, but they have to hope it will be long enough to get the money they need.\n\nThey're pursued by rangers Marcus and Alberto, played by Jeff Brides and character actor Gil Birmingham. Both men are grizzled old hands, though Bridges is the older and by far the more grizzled, and the blunter and more cynical as well. The relationship between him and his half Comanche partner is just like Hank and Gomi from Breaking Bad: plenty of sarcasm, put downs, and occasional slur masking their deep respect and friendship towards each other. For all their rough edges, they're professionals: they have a good idea what kind of suspects they're chasing and what their plan is, and they're never more than a few steps behind.\n\nThe true measure of this movie's brilliance is how much It makes you root for both sides. You want the brothers to get the money and save the farm. But you want the Rangers to catch them just as much. I won't spoil how the movie manages to solve this dilemma, but it's nothing short of masterful. \n\nThe whole movie is masterful. There's dialog here worthy of Tarantino or the Coen Brothers. The final conversation in particular is wonderfully subtle and open ended. The visual aesthetic is magnificently sparse, with many long, unbroken shots of the desert and prairie, or the dusty streets of small town West Texas . The filmmaker's also have a real knack for using natural light to achieve high contrast, through the shadows cast by a sunrise, or the midday sun streaming through the windows of an unlit diner or motel room. The effect is beautiful yet deeply down to earth, adding to the authentic feel.\n\nAnd make no mistake, Hell or High Water is one of the most authentically Texan movies in years. It may not have been filmed on location in Texas, but it's made by people who know Texas: the land, the people, the culture. Writer Taylor Sheridan and director David Mackenzie clearly understand and sympathize with the farmers and ranchers, the waitresses and out of work drillers just barely getting by. They perfectly capture the open ranges and dusty small towns, bringing a sense that we're on the edge of civilization, and in the shadow of better times. \n\nIn terms of mood and visual style there's a lot that's reminiscent of this Last Picture Show. And in terms of style, structure, and craftsmanship, this could easily be a companion feature to No Country for Old Men, to which it clearly owes a great deal of influence. It may not be as well known, but Hell or High Water belongs firmly in the Texas canon alongside these greats.",

The film has a great dynamic for the most part, with the two brothers picking off small time banks, and Bridges' and Co one step behnd, till things inevitably hit the fan to bring the adventure to an inevitable close.\n\nIf you get the chance by all means check out Hell or high water, it isn't an adrenaline packed thriller but will keep you on the edge of your seat from immersion alone.

As far as movie goers go, I may be an exception, but I have a complete lack of romanticism with the American West. I understand the merit of older westerns, but nowadays, they tend to just seem dated. But something about Jeff Bridges in a Texas desert seems right. I'm also a sucker for a good screenplay and some risky robbery scenes, and right off the bat this film lets you know that is what you are in for. The contrast between the four main characters, the two brothers and two rangers, drive the narrative to a point to where you aren't sure who you are rooting for by the time the climactic scene begins. So if you like bank robberies, Chris Pine's eyes, and dramatic scenes of cars being buried, you should check this out. 8.7/10",

Hell or High Water is Bridges' movie and a movie that only stands out because of him.\n- The last quarter of the film sprung upon by the shocking shoot out.\n\nThe Not So Good:\n- Everything else is just bland, blas\u00e9, and a protypical \"poor man fighting for his family against the monster monoploy of the financial system.\"  Better done in larger scope The Big Short.\n- Acting by both Ben Foster and Chris Pine (not quite sure who does better) if fine, but nothing exceptional.\n- Definitely not a Best Picture film.\n- Heist bank scenes are not rivetting nor gusto guns blazing exciting.  Which contributes to the tone being very \"dry\" - as the locations look - dull, and dragged on.\n\nLasting Remarks: \nWithout Jeff Bridges, Hell of High Water would have been turn-offable.",

The film tells the story of Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), two bandits who make assaults on bank boxes and their executioners, the film works on this quest for cat and mouse of the two nuclei . The film tries to pass a moral about not being villains or good guys, in the western, these concepts does not exist, there is only who draws the gun first, the film is great at doing this, even if it happens in the current times, we also have brushstrokes about seeing all Points of view and a criticism of the abandonment of the cities of the interior that are still sunk in the economic crisis of 2008. The photography is great, full of aerial plans, with a palette of colors that pulls red, the climate is hot, photography Is urban and at the same time gives a complete sense of solitude, with a spectacular soundtrack, full of country, you want to pack and move to texas, the track gives the tone of the movie several times, can even play once or Another at wrong times, but it is always a treat anyway. Chris Pine does a good performance, nothing special, he fulfills his role, Ben Foster is well out of tune, his performance is bad and it is not the movie, the gold here is Jeff Bridges, who Acts more physically with his face, full of postures, while sitting, walking, looking, he is a legitimate cowboy, does not deserve the Oscar, but deserved the indication. And a compliment to David Mackenzie who knows how to record moving scenes like no one else. Finally \"At any cost\" is a good movie, for the lovers of the western has a much more special taste.",

            "content": "You can think of Hell or High Water as a modern day western. It certainly has the plot, setting, and characters of a western. We follow a pair of bank robbing brothers and the lawman pursuing them across the dusty landscape of West Texas and the Texas plains. Hell or High Water doesn't reinvent genre, but it doesn't need to; it's executed extremely well. \n\nChris Pine and Ben Foster play the outlaw brothers, Toby and Tanner, respectively. Pine's Toby is the quiet, more reserved brother. Foster's Tanner, recently released from prison, is the more volatile one. There's more to their plan than just grabbing as much money as they can and going on the run. They have a specific amount to rob from a specific chain of banks, Texas Midlands Bank, which is set to foreclose on the family home. They will pay Texas Midlands Bank with money they robbed from its own branches. Toby wants to make sure that his ex-wife and children will have enough money for a secure future. Tanner wants to help his brother, and if that means robbing banks, he's completely willing. \n\nJeff Bridges is the heavy hitter among the cast. It's good to see Bridges give a great, solid performance in a role that is befitting of an actor of his talent, instead of the cartoonish roles he's taken in recent movies. That's not to say that Bridges doesn't bring a certain amount flair-or the tough, western man equivalent-to Marcus Hamilton, a surly Texas Ranger on the brink of retirement. He's smart enough to catch on to the brother's plan and crafty enough to use patience as his method for capturing them. He'll figure out which branch they'll rob next, then sit back and wait for them to mess up. Working with Hamilton is his half-Mexican half-Native American partner, Alberto, who is the subject of relentless racist teasing from Hamilton. Bridges, however, is adept at portraying Hamilton as a man with an underlying, genuine affection for his partner that he has to mask with sarcasm. His Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor comes as no surprise.\n\nThere's a lot of great acting in different styles from the leads. Bridges and Foster are ostentatious; Pine is more subdued and pensive. The screenplay by Taylor Sheridan has rightfully received an Oscar nomination for Original Screenplay; it creates full-fledged characters and successfully divides our sympathy between both cops and criminals. The climatic confrontation is intense and thrilling. It's an action sequence the film earns by firmly establishing what's at stake and building the characters. I wanted Toby and Tanner to get away as much as I wanted Hamilton to catch them. British director David Mackenzie seems to be the perfect fit for this modern day western. He doesn't mythologize or glorify the setting or the characters. These are everyday people dealing with extraordinary circumstances and the final result is an extraordinary film.",

Good story, good writing, good acting, if there was a problem it started feeling like a documentary about the collapse of small town America.

There is enough action to make it fun and enough story to make it interesting. It wouldn't be a Chicago level crime if it won Best Picture, but it shouldn't.

I've probably seen this same scenario a number of different times, but the reasoning behind it is what brings Hell or High Water (2016) into a different category. There have been tons of heist films, and often the robbers have a tight connection, like that of brothers. Heck, The Blues Brothers (1980) essentially did the same basic plot but with \"putting the band back together\" as their way of \"saving the ranch.\"\n\nPartly because this film seemed so quintessentially Texas, I couldn't help thinking it was a toned down version of another Best Picture Oscar winner No Country for Old Men (2007). With last year's Best Picture Oscar nominee, The Big Short (2015), showing how many honest Americans were swindled by the greed of banks, it's no wonder that this year we would see the more down-to-earth side of this financial fiasco. Not only are these robberies meant to save their home, these brothers also wanted to \"stick it to the man\" that put their family in such dire straits to begin with.\n\nIn the end, Hell or High Water is a pretty standard plot and it's pretty predictable from the beginning to the credits. However, when the citizens of these towns aren't concerned that their banks are being robbed and they begin to side with the robbers, you know there's something wrong with the society. Granted, this society in Texas was hit hard by the recession, so it's no wonder that they don't trust the banks that are being knocked off. It's realizations like this that help to show why a presidential candidate practically backed by big banking did not win last November.\n\nA modern twist to a standard bank heist archetype, I give Hell or High Water 4.0 stars out of 5.",

Fortunately, Hell Or High Water has a tight script with some great dialogue and a great cast. All the performances are suburb and all the actors have charisma! Chris Pine does a good job, but the two roles that are Oscar worthy are Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges. I know Jeff Bridges is up for an academy award this year, except I believe Ben Foster should have been in the same category. Ben Foster has come a long way from being the shy, dorky kid from Get Over It back in 2001. He plays the washed up, red neck, bank robber so well. I also love the world that this movie is set in. It feels so much like a classic western, except Texas'a Wild West is full of Dodge Ram Trucks, machine guns and technology. What this film also does well, which reminded me of a Tarantino movie, is that the writers really have an eye for how people in this setting talk. All the little quips from various townsfolk are great and fit the world perfectly. There is a great scene where Jeff Bridges and his partner try to order some food and the waitress comes up and asks, \"Well, what DON'T you want?\" Nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but just a nice world building moment. Another note worthy thing is the action. There isn't much of it, but when it goes down, it goes down! It reminded me a lot of the missions out in the desert of GTA V. Definitely has a Grand Theft Auto vibe to it. Now, I can officially say that there are two movies I'd would rather see win Best Picture other than La La Land. Nothing against La La Land, just saying that Hell Or High Water is a damn good movie!",

Writer Taylor Sheridan continues to slowly make a name for himself in the industry with yet another powerful crime drama following his work on Sicario. Hell or High Water is less tension based than that film, instead choosing to serve as a slow-burn character study with plenty to say about the current state of the country. It's nothing particularly unpredictable in terms of how everything plays out, but Sheridan's work with these characters and their dynamics is solid enough to ignore that. The two lead characters in said character study are played brilliantly by Chris Pine and Ben Foster; the former shows a darker passion that we haven't truly seen from the charming leading man, while the latter's wild intensity is truly mesmerizing. Jeff Bridges takes up supporting duties, and while the character feels very reminiscent of another western character he played not too long before, Rooster Cogburn in the Coen brothers' True Grit remake, but he's simply too good an actor for that to be a major distraction. David Mackenzie directs the film with a deliberate sense of slowness that really gives the big setpieces a bigger punch. When a bank robbery goes down, it feels explosive, but never gratuitous in its violence. Too much of the gunplay and the film becomes a typical action flick: instead, Mackenzie keeps the gunplay on the down-low, and it pays off beautifully.",

It's a very small film, but it has the feel of a big scale film, because they go from various different places over a short period of time. It's a very fast-paced film and it really is a great story about two brothers who are also bank robbers. It was written by Taylor Sheridan who wrote \"Sicario,\" which was also a masterpiece. You are really invested in the characters and the plot from the very beginning of the film and it just takes you on a ride that doesn't end until the end credits hit. The film has one of the best endings I have ever seen; it features so many emotions and so many great small stares between the two characters in the scene. There are great performances, especially by Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges. Foster gives the best performance of his entire career, while Bridges gives a performance that we have never seen before. He is the best thing about this film. There is one downside, and that's some of the characters. They really seem like cartoon characters and I didn't know what they were in this film. However, this is a masterpiece and it's definitely one of the best films this year.",

            "content": "\"Hell or High Water\" combines the action of a heist film with the slow development of a Western.  I love heist films and I'm not a huge fan of Westerns, so this has been a difficult film for me to assess.  The story is clever, the characters are dynamic, the acting is solid, and the cinematography is beautiful.  On the other hand, I believe that the film would benefit from a faster pace.  It wasn't my favorite but I would argue that if this is the future of Westerns, we are headed in the right direction.  It has a \"No Country for Old Men\" feel to it from the very start.  It got to the point where I kept expecting Tommy Lee Jones to walk into each scene and couldn't help but picture his face behind Jeff Bridges' sunglasses and the brim of his hat.  Bridges offers a strong \"old man\" performance that combines the strong will of a weathered lawman with the tiredness of a near retiree.  It is memorable but I wouldn't consider it to be a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination.  Chris Pine has some impressive moments and plays well off of Ben Foster, who finds the right balance between being despicable and likeable.  My favorite performance actually comes from Margaret Bowman as the old, sassy waitress.  The t-bone steak scene was probably my favorite part of the movie and a well-timed moment of comic relief.  The heist is well constructed from the selection of banks to the use of a casino for money laundering.  Visually, the interesting camera angles and filming locations perfectly capture the Western setting.  I don't believe that \"Hell of High Water\" will win any Oscars (in fact, I believe that there were better candidates to have nominations in the categories of Film Editing and Supporting Actor) but its interesting bank robbery story and modern take on a Western are worth seeing.",

            "content": "\"3 Tours in Iraq and No Bailout for People Like Us.\"  These words, spray painted along the side of a stained brick wall, tell the audience who the villain of Hell or High Water is and where the motivation for two brothers to tear through West Texas towns that are all but deserted.  Boarded up storefronts, abandoned gas stations, debt relief and fast cash signs peppered with bullets, sand blasted homes for sale; the vast and sepia toned landscape that is West Texas seems all but abandoned save for these two outlaws, the lawmen that chase them, and the citizens who are protecting whatever they have left.\n\nHell or High Water tells the tale of Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster, respectively), two brothers that go on a bank robbing spree across the plains of West Texas to save their family's land from being seized by the very banks they are robbing.  The lawmen charged with hunting the Howard brothers down are a pair of Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham).  Chris Pine's Toby Howard takes no joy in the path he's chosen in this time of desperation.  It's a choice he struggles with and feels guilty for up until the final moments of the film, but the position he's in doesn't provide an easy out to his problems.  With the burden of providing for his family and keeping his brother Tanner from going off the reservation, Toby understands that if he falls apart so does the plan to ensure his families safety.  Even if it means sacrificing his own.  Ben Foster shines as Tanner Howard, the unstable wild card to Chris Pine's careful but calculating Toby.  Foster has always excelled as a character actor and his portrayal of the life long West Texas cowboy convict is done so with excellent emotional range and comedic wit that steals the movie away from his little brother, the just as voracious yet cliched character of Marcus Hamilton that Jeff Bridges plays, and the emotionally grounded punching bag that is Gil Birmingham's Alberto Parker.\n\nThe biggest success of the film comes from the comedic back and forth between the competing duos; it provides some much needed levity as you are beaten over the head with the environmental and orchestral storytelling of how desperate the wild plains of West Texas have become in a post-recession world.  Foster and Pine's big brother/little brother relationship is believable and relatable through excellent shared storytelling and good natured ribbing.  On the right side of the law, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham provide the perfect yang to the bank robbing brothers yin; their particular brand of good natured ribbing is steeped in Marcus's desire to stay attached to the life he's about to retire from and Alberto's desire to show respect to this ranger that he doesn't feel comfortable with but respects and needs to finish this job.  Writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario, Sons of Anarchy) figured out how to weave comedy back into an old west style cop & robbers film that takes place in modern day. The banter in Hell or High Water provides the audience with a movie that feels like something old given new life.\n\nNowadays, in most crime films, directors and writers are too quick to lay out the story and motivations of the characters.  Leaving little to the imagination of the audience, causing disinterest by the third act as the audience impatiently waits for the conclusion they see coming a mile away.  The film is methodical in its storytelling, and a reminder of films from a different time.  Each scene in Hell or High Water adds a new wrinkle to the main story and to the character(s) of this part of the United States, which much like this type of cops & robbers tale, is being left behind.  By the end of Hell or High Water, you understand the motivations and personality of each character and of those of the towns that are visited throughout.\n\nThe characters on screen entice the audience to not take a side, to root for good to triumph over evil and for evil to escape the good.  Similar to playing cops & robbers when you were a kid, the audience can easily switch sides after the first act, the second, and the third.  To walk away from the experience understanding and appreciating the effort of the filmmakers to make you feel satisfied with the outcome, regardless of who your favorite was.\n\nThe film also takes care to make the Howard Brothers into West Texas Robin Hoods; a point made clear halfway through the film when the attorney handling the money the brothers steal stating \"to see you boys pay those bastards back with their own money?  Well if that ain't Texan I don't know what is.\"  Even Alberto, the half-Native American, half-Mexican ranger points out to Marcus at one point, while the pair stake out a bank, that \"a long time ago your ancestors was the Indians.  Until someone came along and killed em.  Broke em down, made you into one of them.  150 years ago, all this was my ancestors land.  Everything you could see, everything you saw yesterday.  Til' the grandparents of these folks took it.  And now its been taken from them.  Except it ain't no army doing it.  It's those sons of bitches right there\" as he points to the very bank they are protecting.\n\nThat's the charm of Hell or High Water.  The moments of contemplating the right and wrong of the two outlaw brothers actions.  Two other examples of this occur early on in the film; a working mom name Jenny Ann (Katy Mixon) protects the handsome stranger who gave her a $200 tip that's half her mortgage while at the same an old timer (Paul Howard Smith) is trying to make sense of the actions of these outlaws.  \"Seems foolish, days of robbing banks, trying to live and spend the money?  Long gone, long gone for sure.\"  Most modern cat and mouse, cops & robbers movies have gone too high tech.  Robbing a bank in modern movies involves elaborate over planning, augmented reality floor and security layouts, degrees and experience in technical wizardry.  \"Only assholes drink Mr. Pibb\" is an apt line from Tanner Howard that best describes this.  In this film, it's back to basics.  Two men, two guns, some getaway cars, and a simple plan.\n\nIt's that back to basics approach, along with a fantastic original score and soundtrack provided by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, that keeps the tension level high for the entire 102 minutes of the film.  This prevailing sense of tension is encapsulated during the same scene where Alberto pontificates on the state of life in West Texas; Marcus says something that at first seems like a throwaway line.  However, taken into the context of modern cops & robbers tales that allow the outlaws to have multiple small mistakes that don't fuck up the grand plan or prevent them from getting to the final score, Marcus says \"we're just waiting for them to make a mistake.  They haven't made one yet, but they will.\"  That's what makes this movie thrilling.  The stakes are always high; especially since it was established in the first 15 minutes of the film that each bank they enter has the chance that someone in that bank is packing heat and is more than happy to dispense vigilante justice.\n\nHell or High Water is a thrilling, western crime story about the desperation of the outlaws to save what's theirs and the duty bound lawmen trying to hunt them down.  For all the ambiguity and slow pacing of the story, the film ends with a clear winner and loser and leaves you wanting another old west tale.  Perhaps this movie will reinvigorate writers and filmmakers to realize that sometimes the most compelling cat and mouse game is the one that occurs in a box.  Less Mr. Pibb, more Dr. Pepper.",

Many might give this one a miss because of the mellow trailers but it's a good movie. No doubt about that.\n\nSTORY & SCRIPT - The story revolves around two brothers who are planning to pay their debts by robbing banks and two ageing officers who apparently are the only ones following this case. Jeff Bridges' character, Marcus Hamilton wants a last swan song to end his career with, due to which he is hell-bent on catching these mystery robbers who are going from one bank to another. Toby and Tanner are polar opposites of each other. When one is hot-headed, the other is smart and cool but both of them are sincere about their family. The story has a very slow pace and after the consecutive robberies the movie almost comes to a halt. It allows the dust to settle before the final showdown. The ending in particular was beautiful. It had me engaged about what was going to happen and when the credits rolled I was left thinking what will the final confrontation between Toby and Marcus will be like and that's what a movie should do.\n\nDIRECTION - It was bold of the director to maintain such a slow pace to such a simple movie. We could see the ending right after the halfway mark but do you know what kept me interested? The characters. The interactions. Most of the times in movies when I see two characters interacting, I feel like people don't like like that. At that moment the movie just looses me. In this movie, the interactions felt natural. There were silent moments which left room for character building. The racial undertones in the characters didn't stick out. It felt rather natural because unlike Tanner, Marcus was racist just to tease his partner. That scene when Marcus finally gets his revenge got to me. Not kidding. Every character felt well-rounded from start to finish. Right from the waitress(both of them) to the main characters. I liked the final reveal of Marcus' body and you hear a rattling noise and you see that death was right at his feet. Just the bearer of it changed.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY - Let me get rid of two minor gripes. One was the sky at the beginning of the movie. It felt very artificial. Second was the fire. The CGI was really off. Probably due to budget constraints. Other than that the landscape shots and action scenes were very well shot. The bleak tone of the scenario was very aptly captured. As the movie was not rushed you have the time to actually take in the scenery, making the scenery a character of the movie.\n\nACTING - Ben Foster was the highlight of the movie and I am happy that he was. Blunt, brute and stubborn but with a heart of gold. He felt like he had dug his hands deep into this character and he delivered perfectly. Chris Pine also showcased the finer side of his acting prowess after starring in cheesy roles and of course as Captain Kirk. Jeff Bridges, was also in his comfort zone and boy was this a step-up from R.I.P.D.\n\nFINAL VERDICT - A very mellow and probably underrated too but a must watch for people who love a slow paced movie. Due to the movies grounded tone, I felt fresh because lately I have been seeing all these cheesy movies with weak scripts botched by production houses. Very few times a movie with such a cast delivers and I can say this that this movie delivers and delivers well.",

The highlight of the film is Jeff Bridges' character in which he is a hard boiled cop on the verge of retirement. Jeff Bridges comes in also as the comic relief in the movie providing some well needed humor in this neo crime western thriller. The chemistry between all characters in the movie is great. The soundtrack is also great featuring many poignant country songs. The only thing I didn't like in the movie was the was the development of Chris Pine's family as the relationship between him and his son seemed lacking. Hell or high water is one of my favorite movies of this year and is recommended to everyone who loves an outstanding movie.",

There is a broad understanding of history and how it has shaped these types of town and the people that live in them (and America as a whole).  There are only a few weak points, 1) some unclear story points, 2) the use of country music/new country songs with vocals was unnecessary (also, not a fan of country music so that drew me out of the film a bit).

            "content": "Review:\r\nI really had high hopes for this movie, after reading rave reviews but I must admit, I found it slightly boring because it takes some time for something to happen. Its about 2 brothers, Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine), who go around robbing banks, to try and save there families land, after there mother dies. Tanner is the ruthless brother, who has just been released from jail and has a dodgy past but Toby has a clean record, and has spent time looking after his mum before she died. Whilst going through a separation with his wife, Toby plans to leave his kids there land, which has oil beneath it, but they have to buy the land before the bank takes it away from them. Whilst going on a robbing rampage, Texas ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges), makes it his goal to catch the thieves before he retires, with his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), who questions his methods. When Marcus finally works out there pattern, the rangers finally come face to face with the robbers but Toby manages to get away. With the case closed, and the blame fully on Tanner for the robberies, Marcus works out that he wasn't working alone but there isn't enough evidence to takedown Toby, who played a big part in the robberies. It's quite a basic plot, with no thrills or twists, so I was surprised that it went down so well with audiences. The cast played there roles extremely well, and the chemistry between the two brothers is very believable but it seemed very one toned in my eyes. There is some enjoyable wit, especially between Marcus and Alberto, which lightened up the intense mood but I still was expecting more from this western. Watchable!\r\n\r\nRound-Up:\r\nThis movie was directed by David Mackenzie, 50, who also brought you The Last Wilderness, Young Adam, Asylum, Hallam Foe, Spread, Perfect Sense, You Instead and the great Starred Up starring Jack O'Connell. He certainly has covered many genres throughout his career, and he was a surprising choice to take on a western, because he is born in Scotland and his last film was a prison drama. He done a good job with the script, which was written by Taylor Sheridan who brought you Sicario, and he put together a great cast, who were perfect for there roles. At 67 years old, Jeff Bridges has proved, time and time again, that he still has it, and with a role in the upcoming Kingsman sequel, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, and another 4 projects in the pipeline, he certainly isn't planning to stop acting any time soon. Anyway, I can understand why people enjoyed it but I still preferred No Country For Old Men.\r\n\r\nBudget: $12million\r\nWorldwide Gross: $27million\r\n\r\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their crime/western/dramas, starring Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, Gil Birmingham, Katy Mixon, Dale Dickey, Buck Taylor, William Sterchi, Kristin Berg, Jackamoe Buzzell. 5/10",

Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges plays the burbling racist Ranger on their tail - or, at the very least, sitting around at the next potential crime scene hoping they'll show up.\nFamily politics and anti-capitalism pretend to play a part, too, but are drowned out by pitch black comedy and the gleefully chilidish chase at the film's heart.

            "content": "Scottish director David Mackenzie has steadily been making a name for himself over the years with some strong, low-key work in his native Scotland; Hallam Foe, Young Adam and, especially, Perfect Sense showcased his obvious abilities. It would seem that it was his superb prison drama Starred Up in 2013 that caught everyone's eye, though. Hell or High Water now sees him taking his first venture onto American soil but it doesn't hinder his abilities in the slightest. If anything, it has proven that Mackenzie is a director of genuine quality. \n\nPlot: Needing to pay off the reverse mortgage on their recently deceased Mother's ranche, brothers Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) target several branches of the Texas Midland Bank to raise the money. This invites the attention of Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) who is doggedly determined in tracking them down and putting an end to their spate of robberies.\n\nIt doesn't take long to realise that Hell or High Water is a very different type of western. It's one that, for obvious reasons, has been labelled as a \"neo-western\" but it's contemporary nature is the very angle in which it's able to fully explore its themes. The west has changed and the end of its way of life is fast approaching the characters of Taylor Sheridan's dense script. He makes regular mention of the passage of time, ever changing landscapes and epoch's; if it wasn't the white settlers taking the land from the natives then it's the banks foreclosing on it, forcing families into debt and desperation. \n\nThis is ultimately the motivation that drives the antagonists as other subtle hints on the state of the American economy are delivered under the guise of a crime/heist film. What we see on the surface of Hell or High Water doesn't begin to describe the many layers underneath. And that's ultimately what sets it apart from most other films of the genre. \n\nAs mentioned, Sheridan's script is multilayered and he also incorporates the themes of brotherly love, loss, family responsibility and ownership which are demonstrated through crisp dialogue and genuinely dramatic (and sometimes darkly humorous) exchanges between the mismatched characters. \n\nSpeaking of which, the characters are authentically drawn while also excellently played by the three leads; Pine exudes a brooding intensity while Foster is allowed more room to explore the unhinged sociopath. Now that Bridges is getting older, he has pretty much mastered the surly old-codger routine and does so again with great authority and panache. \n\nThere's a deliberate pace to the film, so those expecting tension filled bank robberies and high speed chases will have to be patient. These moments are provided but they come at the cost of investing your time in the characters. And it's an investment that pays off. \n\nIt also helps that's its beautifully shot by Giles Nuttgens and Mackenzie makes good use of the photography and employs a meditative approach to the proceedings while showing an assured confidence in his direction. \n\nA rich and rewarding western crime story that delivers on many levels. It's broad strokes signify a maturity and that maturity is tied up with a very satisfying conclusion.\n\nMark Walker",

            "content": "\"I've been poor my whole life, like a disease passing from generation to generation.\"\n\nOne of the great aspects of film is its unpredictability in what will or won't be a great film. Every year there seems to be one or two films that no one believed would be any good yet somehow result in being one of the most acclaimed films of the year. This year that film was Hell or High Water. Directed by David Mackenzie, this modern day western stars Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Jeff Bridges and outlines the story of two brothers who are attempting to rob banks to pay back the bank that is cheating them out of their late mother's farm and the lawmen that are chasing them. It is extremely interesting how this film had little anticipation or hype surrounding its initial release but, after it was released, it was shown to be one of the best films of the year. The directing of this film is innovative and involves both the foreground and the background of shots. Its editing is static for most of the movie with level camera shots. However, this is effective since when the camera shots are tilted, they evoke emotional responses. There are also many engaging car chases and gun fights that are both exciting and have some somber or deadly moments to it. This incorporation allows for the film to have a good balance of quiet moments and intense action filled moments, some even at the same time. This duality also is conveyed through the great performances of the main actors. While I am normally not a fan of his acting, Chris Pine does a great job as the younger less experienced brother. His constant justification of his actions and his overwhelming fear of being caught is conveyed through his expressions and acting abilities. Ben Foster also shines as the older brother to Pine. His insanity yet charm is expressed at different times and this duality makes his character interesting. Both of these actors also have chemistry together as a brotherly bond. A similar chemistry of brothers forms between Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham. Jeff Bridges is able to make his character more than the generic older cop. He has a fear of retirement and uselessness and he conveys this in friendly insults and jokes at the expense of his sidekick. Bridges is also shown to be clever, capable, sympathetic, and friendly. Birmingham is also great with a sympathetic view of the world and the way he as a Native American is treated by others. Birmingham's description of hi people's treatment connects to the main and interesting themes of the film. The film conveys a message on how Native Americans were driven off their land by those more powerful than them. This message is compared to the way many poor farmers and smaller businesses are driven away by big and corrupt businesses. This comparison and the subtle way it is expressed makes the film interesting. This film actually has few flaws in it. The pacing does drag at times. While the quieter or character based moments are welcome, they sometimes go on too long or seem unnecessary. Additionally, despite an engaging, entertaining, and a technically beautiful opening scene, the beginning of the film includes a great deal of poorly delivered exposition, However, these faults do not completely hinder the film. Overall, Hell or High Water is a western crime film with interesting characters and messages on businesses. I would recommend it to fans of modern westerns, crime movies, or strong and subtle acting.",

            "content": "Falling into the category of \"neo-western\", Hell or High Water manages to play with some familiar western tropes. Landing us square in the open Texas landscape, the imagery immediately positions itself as a leading character in the film, contrasting debt relief signs and poverty amongst pictures of oil rigs and prosperity. it's bleak but beautiful, and intentionally complex, and it lends perfectly towards three great on-screen performances by Pine, Bridges and Foster. \n\nPine and Foster play two estranged brothers who are reunited by the death of their grandmother and the ensuing fight to save their family ranch. Bridges plays a sheriff who is facing retirement but finds himself pulled into the case of a string of robberies that the greater law enforcement sees as too small to warrant attention. \n\nThe film opens with a scene of a small, unpolished robbery sequence that introduces us to the fact that it is the two brothers that are committing the robbery. The real question of the film is why they are robbing the banks, and this question is probed throughout the duration of the film. It is this question that also provides the nuanced moral landscape that pulls us back and forth from good intentions to questionable choices. In this way, the film toys with the romance of the outlaw, which is really where we find the true brilliance of the film. The story is simple, almost familiar, but it is the feature-length character study  that makes the story so intriguing and watchable. There is no clear-cut redemptive story at play here, and no clear-cut villain or hero.\n\nIt would be hard to speak of this film without mentioning the obvious. There is a sort of dark humor at play, particularly in the performances, that warrant comparisons to the Coen Brothers (particularly No Country For Old Men). But the film is more than just a copy of their familiar literary style, and the performances ensure that Hell or High Water paves it's own path. What is most interesting about the performances is the way it taking actors (certainly Pine and Bridges) most accustomed to lead roles and playing them off each other in three supporting roles. No single character is asked to carry the film, and while this might diminish the ability of the film to represent a single, stand-out performance, what it does is open the door for the actors to truly engage their roles without the added pressure. We see this mostly in the down and gritty performance of Pine, who plays the more grounded brother (Foster is the more off-the-cuff character most likely to make the questionable choices along the way) who becomes less grounded as the story goes on. Pine really offers an intriguing character study as one who must navigate his character with subtle purpose as he moves back and forth between this complicated development. Bridges is equally good in his role, and is offered an opportunity to engage a performance that is a bit more straight-forward and on the surface than Pine's, which shows to be a nice fit (and requires equal balance) for a man who is used to giving everything to characters that require an immense level of depth. It is nice to see him give a performance that is so relaxed. \n\nHell or High Water is set in an age past, but it feels incredibly in tune and relevant as a piece that seems adept at giving a nod to the coming future.",

            "content": "Today I'm going to give you my review of the 2016 film Hell or High Water. This movie is about a couple of brothers robbing banks to raise money that they owe to a bank. I don't want to tell you why they owe money exactly, because I feel like the story is better off if you find out while watching it, like I did. This movie is honestly my favorite that I've seen this year and today I'm going to tell you guys why this movie is such a classic.\n\nThe biggest thing that stuck out to me was the performances of all the actors/actresses in this film, so I'll just go through the list. First off, Chris Pine does an absolutely amazing job in this movie, even though he was great in Star Trek and pretty good in this years Finest Hours, I would say this is the best performance he has given this year, and maybe even the best in his career. One thing I really loved about this performance was the accent that Chris Pine used in this movie, it was very very believable. He also brings a dark and realistic tone to this movie that really sets the tone for this movie and drives the story to be more believable and more relatable. Now Ben Foster in this movie really is unbelievable in this movie, he really embodies this role, while I was watching the movie I couldn't even tell that it was Ben Foster, he does a great job in every way, all in all it was a perfect performance, and I really hope to see him get at least an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Now another actor that I firmly believe should be nominated for a best supporting role was Jeff Bridges, who plays this sheriff who is on the verge of retirement and this is his last rodeo, he spends most the movie trying to track down the two criminal brothers. He adds some comedy to this film that fits in perfect, there is not too many jokes and they all seem to hit at perfect times. Jeff Bridges just like Chris Pine gives a great accent that is very believable and feels real. The chemistry between him and Gil Birmingham was perfect, their dialog felt so real it left me wanting to see more of them two together. At the end of the day the performances of this movie were amazing everyone in this film does an absolutely incredible job!\n\nAnother thing I really loved in this movie was the music, it really fit so perfectly with the film. The score has kind of a western music theme to it, and it fits so well. The music was so subtle and it just makes you feel more connected with the world, just like every musical score should do.\n\nI also believe that David Mackenzie did a great job directing the movie, every shot felt so real and it felt like it really fit with the tone of this film. David Mackenzie is really a great up and coming directer and I'm excited to see what he does next.",

The so called bubble, make home owners unaware of the major treat of banks taking advantage of their costumers and scamming to the point of foreclosure.

Toby (Chris Pine) a divorced father and Tanner (Ben Forster) an ex-con mother passed away recently, leaving their ranch in a debt due to a reverse mortgage,Toby thinks this is the best way to find the money to pay the debt.\n\nTexas Rangers Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alrberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) are assigned to the case. Hamilton is close to retire, he figure out the plan of the brothers Howard set in motion a plan to catch them with the help of Arlberto Parker. \n\n\"Hell or Highwater\" is considered by a neo-western film, because all the elements used to tale the story as well of the esthetics and look of the cowboy movies. After careful analysis you can tell the director David Mackenzie and writer Taylor Sheridan dig deeper into western movies to metaphorically represents two cowboys robbing banks looking for poetic justice, been chased by the sherif who is sure from the very beginning who is the mastermind in this crime. \"Hell or Highwater\" have several connotations of the struggle of the good vs evil, bringing the enigma of who is the real bad guy, like in Clint Eastwood \"Unforgiven\" as well social criticism to private institutions who sometimes are not the good guys, but the bad guys, just ripping people off, as a consequence there is a quest for full revenge.\n\nThe all star cast deliver a great performance and Nick Cave & Warren Ellis presents one of the finest original score on screen.",

While it offers nothing new in terms of plot, narrative or screenplay - it more than makes up through confident direction, well defined character arcs and excellent performances throughout. \n\nToby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster) are estranged brothers who led completely different lives - one (Toby) as a doting son, caring husband and father, while the other (Tanner) has been on the wrong side of the law from the beginning who has spent most of his time in various prisons for petty thefts and robberies. When the bank announces to foreclose their property due to unpaid debts just when Toby discovers oil in their farm, he is desperate to get possession of it before it is reclaimed by the bank forever. Toby comes up with a plan to rob the same bank (multiple of its branches) and seeks assistance from his brother Tanner who regularly agrees. What happens when the plan is set in motion and a retiring police chief Marcus from a small town starts investigating.\n\nChris Pine was a revelation in this role. While it is not intense or award worthy, he does complete justice by portraying a stubborn, meticulous and sometimes desperate man to get over with what they started. Jeff Bridges has some of the best lines though they range from being insensitive to downright racist - he surely offends Indian tribes, blacks, mexicans etc. along the way. But the dry humor he evokes along with his Indian partner are worth a second watch. The screenplay plays down many intense sequences to ensure they do not get sopped down or become melodramatic which would be inconsistent with the overall theme. \n\nThe setup, the screenplay that reveals the plot without the characters saying it as a narrative shows the ability of the director about the confidence and the intensity shown in the 2013 'Starred Up' was a testimony to his talent. Jeff Bridges is one of the better contemporary Hollywood actors and his choice of roles has always been that extract maximum performance within the mainstream cinema. Ben Foster plays a very generic not so bright but trigger happy ex-con which has been played over many times but still done as good as it could be.\n\nSometimes innovation is not the only answer to standout. Perfection and old school intensity does work too.",

Feels like a modern western kind, because of where this story takes place, I mean Texas. There's no digital world like phones, computers et cetera, just an old fashioned storytelling. This is the story of two brothers and their series of bank robbery job. They are doing it for a reason, but on the other end, two cops make their effort to find who they are and nab them red handed. So when they meet, that's where the story gets to its end part.\n\nIt has a strong opening, then slows down. Actually, it was approached like a classic crime film, which mean no high-tech. The story was a one liner, but the events in that story were extended. A simple screenplay, yet very effective presented on the screen. Of course the story ends with this film, but feels like there's more. It is very unlikely, though I'm thinking of a sequel.\n\nThe people will remember this film for Ben Foster and Chris Pine. One of the best duo on the screen. Easily one of the best films of the year, but just it is a different theme and genre. I watched it not knowing the meaning of the title, and then I googled it. It is nothing like a must see, but I believe that you might regret if you miss it or delay your watch. So I suggest you make a right choice.\n\n8/10",

Now this is not a very complicated story. \u00a0It's men at the end of their rope, being forced into a crime that they otherwise wouldn't commit, all the while the law moves in closer and closer. \u00a0What makes this movie so good and the reason why this is being considered for Academy Awards is due to all of the attention to detail. \u00a0This is the most Texas movie since There Will Be Blood, and after\u00a0all\u00a0is said and done, you really feel like you've taken a personal trip to the state where everything's bigger, and not to its nicer, more progressive side. \u00a0I feel like I learned two things about Texas from this movie, the first item being that open carry is in full effect, and everybody in Texas is packing. \u00a0It helps add to tension in scenes being that you know that so many civilians could potentially pull out a gun and make the situation go from bad to worse. \u00a0The second item is that everyone's a little bit racist in this state. \u00a0Jeff Bridges gives a terrific performance as a Texan detective that is close to retirement. \u00a0He still has a little bit of that True Grit accent left over, and every other sentence out of his mouth is something racially offensive, which isn't aided by the fact that he has a Native American partner. \u00a0It's almost on that level of Gran Torino where you're unsure if this is a man who just thinks racial humor is funny, or if he could potentially be the biggest racist you've ever laid eyes on.  This movie would pair terrifically with No Country for Old Men. \u00a0It is well made and character driven, and you are always interested in how it will play out. \u00a0It's all about just how quickly a simple plan can go south, and you're rooting for these guys to succeed in addition to rooting for Jeff Bridges to catch them, so it makes for an intriguing dynamic. \u00a0There's some very appropriate music featured from Nick Cave, and every time there is a showdown, you hold your breath. \u00a0It's a good, simple movie, and I will always love a movie for getting the terrific Ben Foster more work.",

The characters are deep but laconic, with every word as important as the surrounding silence it is embedded within.  In fact much is conveyed without words at all rather simply a look - you know, acting.  The setting and cinematography perfectly reveal the nature of windswept poverty, with the legacy of struggle so deep that is at once both invisible and pronounced in every character in the film - serving as backdrop and impetus for the characters of Chris Pine, Ben Hogan, and Jeff Bridges to intersect.  Beautifully directed - think Lasse Hallstrom combined with the Coen Brothers.  Highly recommend.",

Their banter is often times hilarious and feels like something real brothers would say to each other. Foster is particularly amazing at portraying Tanner as an \"aw-shucks\", charming yet lethal ex-con bank robber.  The audience can't help but like him, even though he can be a cold-blooded killer. Bridges and Birmingham give great performances as laid-back but serious Rangers on the trail of the two brothers. They are cool as beans even under gunfire. Badasses, without any posturing.\n\nThe plot is pretty straight-forward. The two brothers come up with a plan to rob from the very bank that is foreclosing on their family ranch. So they rob banks in order to come up with enough cash to pay off the bank. The story is simple but the great acting captures your attention and never lets go. Highly recommended.",

Chris Pine gives one of his best performances as one brother, and Ben Foster's performance is arguably his best. Echoing a very similar outlaw in the remake of 3:10 to Yuma, Foster does a great job of playing an unpredictable, unhinged sociopath. The performance is Oscar-nomination worthy at the very least. The first hour or so didn't impress me too much, but once the third act began, it quickly became a deeply engaging experience that I can confidently recommend to anyone that likes good acting and good storytelling.",

I love Pine's strong, heroic, and charming characters so that may be why I felt let down by his character here that was the opposite on all three fronts.  Aside from that, I still didn't find much to redeem the movie: the non-weak character is a reckless idiot.  I suppose it is more about the journey than the destination.  On the other hand, I think it is set up for a great sequel -- Pine's strengthening character arc would be a great counterpart to Bridges in a second episode.",

            "content": "I know the comparison will not be seen as favorable to some, but elements of this movie sure do remind me of No Country for Old Men.  And I mean stylistically speaking.  Thematically, they're both very different movies, because this one tells a more personal tale of two brothers trying to fuck over the banks who fucked over their mother by giving her a loan that she could not pay back.  They do this by stealing from several of the branches that fucked their mother over and using that money to pay the bank back, which is pretty clever if you actually think about it.  And it would be cool if someone could actually do that.  And maybe someone already has, but, of course, it's not something I would go around publicizing.  I think both movies do share some thematic elements as well, such as the old ranger close to retirement finding one more chance for a last hurrah after a series of bank robberies break out reminding me of Tommy Lee Jones' character in No Country.  And the cat and mouse game that ensues as both search for their respective suspects.  One of the, many, things I like about this movie is the fact that it all seems to be heading to one direction.  There's no real deviation from that main narrative path with subplots.  Nothing to distract you from the fact that the brothers and the rangers are on a collision course.  It's just a matter of time before they find each other and all hell breaks loose.  I know it's something very simple and something that, really, every movie should do.  Just focus on exactly what you want your story to be and how you want your characters to get there.  And I realize that a lot of movies do this, but it somehow doesn't feel as focused as it does in this movie.  There's a clear endgame in sight for the story and these characters and it's just a matter of seeing how they get there.  The film is definitely very confident in the pace that it wants to tell its story.  They do not rush through any scenes and everything in the film serves a purpose, there's no wasted moments here.  All of it works to add up to the climax, which you know will be bloody and you know people will die.  So, yea, I really liked that.  Do I feel that the movie was great?  I don't know, I honestly don't feel like it was.  I think it was missing something.  While I do like the fact that the brothers pay the banks back with their own (stolen) money, I feel that the movie pretty much hit every plot point I could have reasonably expected from them.  I don't wanna say it's completely predictable, but you can see where certain things are headed before they happen.  I did like the fact that the reason Chris Pine's character did what he did was to avenge what the banks had done to his mother, but also to give his sons a future where they wouldn't have to worry about money because of the oil that was found on his land.  I liked all of that for sure.  I also thought the writing was strong and the acting was excellent.  Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges really are phenomenal here, but, to me, Ben Foster steals the show.  Ben is as underrated as they come and this is just another feather in his cap.  I can't complain about the acting in the slightest and anyone who does is clearly looking for something, anything, to hate about this movie.  But, as I said, there was just something missing that would have pushed it past the great level and maybe made it a modern classic in a couple of years' time.  I can see how people might already see it as a great movie, but I just don't.  That's not to say it isn't a damn good movie that you should see, because it is and I would definitely give it a recommendation.  But just go in with tempered expectations.  Great acting and strong writing, so, yea, you can't really go wrong here.",

Instead of mindless action and black and white good or bad, intense focus is drawn to the writing, cinematography and amazing performances, and as a result this is one of the most satisfying experiences of the year. Don't go thinkin' it aint got style though, because the tight humour and solid score deliver a home run in that department too.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Once it's got going, the plot is rather basic 'highway to the end' stuff, which makes it feel a little dragged out.\nVERDICT: A well constructed movie from Mackenzie that's brilliant elements aren't quite given the time to shine by the plot direction. It is full of brilliant stuff, though",

            "content": "'Hell or High Water' is a Western Crime Drama that substitutes the large scale chaotic shootouts for great character depth and exploration of character relationships. Starring Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, and Ben Foster this film follows two brothers Toby (Pine) and Tanner (Foster) robbing banks to set up a better future for themselves, but they soon find themselves being tracked down by rangers Marcus (Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) who are going for one last hunt before retirement. Performance-wise this film shines above most others to have released this year, as you completely bought into the characters at the forefront of the film and you believed the authenticity and history of their relationships without seeing any of it. Pine and Bridges especially are the standouts on either sides of the law. From a story perspective it was great to see a contemporary Western film take advantage of the characters they have and really delve deep into who they are and let those relationships and actions drive the course of the film. Because without engaging, and entertaining characters there is no reason for investment in any shootouts that may or may not occur.\n\nThe character centric nature of the film is what makes it so compelling for so long. On one hand, following the lives of these two brothers and seeing how they connect and clash with their different personalities and values offered a very complex look at these characters. Are they good people? Are they doing it for good reasons? Are they hurting people for the fun of it? Exploring all of these questions throughout the film put you on a journey with these two who you may grow to love or hate with time. And then you also have the film focusing on Marcus and Alberto and their journey just casually investigating some bank robberies and tracking down the brothers. This was a relationship that was also just as interesting as that between the brothers but for very different reasons. The way these partners go back and forth, throwing friendly insults and butting heads but ultimately tolerating each others company was a nice comparison and contrast to the relationship being shown with our bank robbers. \n\nThe slow, gradually intensifying pacing did a good job at keeping you interested for the majority of the film but could have done with a little bit of a kick somewhere in the middle of the film. It noticeably slows down for a 20 minute interval around half way through, and some of that period of time did have some interesting character dialogue happening but it was starting to lose me a little. It does then pick back up and finish very strong which was really good to see it not continue to slow down and fizzle out in the end which was a fear for around 10 minutes.\n\nAs i mentioned the performances in this film are definitely some of the strongest of the year, and although it may be a little early to tell, i wouldn't be too surprised if one of them gets a nod at the Academy Awards. Chris Pine for me was the strongest of the bunch, seeing him play a very subdued role and a different role to what he is typically cast in was very refreshing. He didn't once break character and when the movie started i thought i was going to be distracted seeing him in this Texan role but he worked his magic and i completely bought into him as this character. Ben Foster also should be recognised because he plays well together with Pine and the back and forth conversations they have are interesting on their own. Jeff Bridges is playing a character that he has more or less played in many other Western/Crime films but he is just so good in the role that you wouldn't want anyone else. \n\nSo 'Hell or High Water' is a really solid film that is very well crafted and features great all round performances and a very compelling character centric story. You get on board with these characters and are on a journey with both sides of the law so you feel a connection with both sets of characters making pivotal moments in the film that much more intense. \n\n8/10",

A modern-day Western set against the bleak landscape of the fossil fuel industry's boom-and-bust cycle nadir, where only the banks make out unless the tables are turned.\n\nExcellent performances all around support an intricate and always riveting plot where the line between right and wrong becomes blurred, and lives are essentially swapped in what plays out as a zero-sum game - except life isn't a game. \n\nWhile this can be seen strictly as a bank-robbery-shoot-em-up film, the undercurrent of dire poverty in rural America where the promises of good jobs and comfortable lives give way to the very real struggles for survival make this a memorable and great film. Definitely, modern-day shades of Grapes of Wrath meets Bonnie & Clyde meets Unforgiven.",

With the help of his other brother, Tanner (Ben Foster: OSCAR WATCH), Toby takes to robbing small-town banks. A law enforcement officer (Jeff Bridges) and his partner (Gil Birmingham) try to catch the criminals.\n\nI read about this movie in a magazine this past Summer before its limited release and was intrigued by the idea of Chris Pine starring in a small-scale independent film. The magazine praised his performance almost as much as they praised Ben Foster's, and other reviews for the limited release echoed these sentiments. Finally, the movie was released digitally, so I had an opportunity to see what the hype was about. Hot damn, was this movie fun!\n\nThis is a drama first and foremost. As much as we all love shoot-em-ups, it's good to see a crime film with such richly developed characters. Ben Foster has never been better - watch out for him come awards season for Supporting Actor. His troubled past and care for his younger brother really define him. Chris Pine came to play, too. We know him for his blockbuster hits like Star Trek, but he showed that he can tone it down and deliver an emotional performance as well. Jeff Bridges is exactly what you'd want Jeff Bridges to be when portraying a southern cop; his relationship with his partner reminded me of Hank and his partner from Breaking Bad, and both of their characters had depth beyond chasing the crooks as well. David Mackenzie is not a name I'm familiar with, but he really crafted something big here. The beautiful scenic shots of rural Texas, in addition to the perfect film score, really gives this setting an authentic feeling.\n\nOverall, this movie has everything I want from an independent drama: solid writing, outstanding acting, and emotions. Hopefully this marks a turning point in the two young stars' careers.\n\nFinal grade: A\n\n-Ben\n\nOverall, this movie has everything I wa",

            "content": "Hell or High Water is an amazing and gripping western heist film. It stars Chris Pine, Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges, and Gil Birmingham. Chris Pine and Ben Foster play brothers who start robbing banks for a personal reason. Chris Pine and Ben Foster both deliver career defining performances and have great on screen chemistry. Chris Pine delivers a subtle and emotionally reserved performance, that really cements him as a great dramatic actor. Ben Foster turns in what I think is the best performance of the movie and his career. He plays an unpredictable, charismatic, and borderline-crazy ex-con. His character commits horrid actions towards the end of the movie, and other things he's done are hinted at, but he's so likable thanks to Foster's performance and the script, that it's extremely difficult to dislike or root against him. Jeff Bridges play's an aging soon to retire texas ranger, who takes on one more case before leaving the force for good. He delivers a performances akin to True Grit (2010) and Crazy Heart (2009). He turns in a great performance, one that deserves a spot on his decade spanning filmography. He has great chemistry with his partner, played by Gil Birmingham, and it was fun to watch them interact and try and track down the bank robbers (Pine and Foster). This film has great direction, and thats thanks to David Mackenzie. He previously directed Starred Up, one of my personal favorite films of 2013. He's great at directing characters, scenery, and action. The script was written by Taylor Sheridan who has a great track record, this being his second script after Sicario, which was one of my favorites of 2015. Here he crafts great dialogue, interesting and believable characters, and is able to mix in elements of comedy, with creating an inconsistent tone. The score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is great, and really helps set the scene, set the tone, and build tension. Finally the cinematography by Giles Nuttgens is great, and there are some really good shots in this film. I'd say this a must see, and I'd recommend watching it as soon as you can.",

It shows us the people who live in the loose regulatory environment of the flat, relatively empty parts of the American South, the people we know voted for Trump and,for me at least, humanized them. \nHell or High Water also has a very important political message that is a catalyst for the plot and only needs a short speech to make it clear what this movie is saying about what money has done to the barren, poor South. \nThe performances are also excellent across the board. It is great to see Ben Foster getting more work and hopefully he'll get some recognition come awards season because he owns this film.",

I love him in everything.\nJeff Bridges has really been hitting the Big Screen hard the last few years.  He's perfect at playing a crusty old guy with a thick Southern drawl.  He does a great job in this film.  My only complaint is that half of the time you can hardly understand what he's saying because he grumbles and mumbles so much.\nBen Foster does an excellent job.\nIt's not smart to rob a bank in Texas where so many people have a conceal/carry license.  Ha ha   Tanner laughs, \"These conceal carry permits sure complicate a bank robbery, don't they?\"\nI had just learned what Pemmican is and they actually mentioned it in this movie.\"  Check out this video to see for yourself what pemmican is and why it's the perfect survival food.\nThere is a surprising amount of humor.\nThe T-bone waitress (Margaret Bowman) conversation was pretty funny.\nThe weathered faces and attitudes of the poor Texans was believable. \nYou just don't mess with a good, ole boy Texan sherriff\n\n\nThings I didn't like:\nMarcus makes lots of racist comments about Mexicans, native Americans, and Christians.\nBig banks as the enemy is certainly not a new idea.\nI just really wanted the brothers to take a shower. \n\nInteresting lines:\n\"You never understood that fighting back makes the beating last longer.\" -  Toby (Chris Pine)\n\"You know what Comanche means.  It means enemies forever.\" - Bear (Gregory Cruz)\n\"You know what that makes me?  A Comanche.\" - Tanner\n\"You tell me not to be like you and then you offer me a beer.  Which is it?\" - Justin Howard (John-Paul Howard)\n\n \n\nFunny lines: \n\n\"Why are you always dressed like me?\" - Marcus (Jeff Bridges)\n\"This is our uniform.\" - Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham)\n\"You want to hear about these robberies or just sit there and let Alzheimer's run its course?\" - Alberto\n\"Could you tell their race?  Black?  White?\" - Marcus\n\"Their skin or their souls?\" - Elsie (Dale Dickey)\n\"Tweakers don't sleep.  They just tweak.\" - Alberto   (\"Tweaker\" is slang for drug addicts.)\n\"You Rangers are an odd bunch.\" - Bank Manager (Joe Berryman)\n\"No, just him.\" - Alberto\n\"Only A-holes drink Mr. Pibb.\" - Tanner\n\"In your last days in the nursing home, you'll think of me and giggle.\" - Tanner\n\"Anything a 5 year old can do ain't a sport.\" - Marcus\n\"This is what they call 'white man's intuition.'\" - Marcus\n\"Sometimes a blind pig finds a truffle.\" - Alberto\n\n\n\nTips for parents:  \n\nLots of profanity, including lots of F-bombs.\nSome people get shot and killed with some blood and gore.\nYou'll want to make sure your kids understand that just because someone needs money or has a sob story, it doesn't mean it's OK to commit crime.",

And the remainder of the film, all the way up until the bittersweet closing shot, doesn't disappoint. The story is set in a post-GFC West Texas and follows two bank-robbing brothers who have underlying motives to their unlawful actions (to tell would spoil the narrative's wonderful drip-feed style), whilst also tracking the soon-to-be-retired Ranger who's seeking to finish his career on a high. Taylor Sheridan's screenplay is remarkably simple yet effective, wisely resisting the temptation to resort to thriller-ish tropes despite ostensibly playing like one. He allows the multi-layered characters to do all the heavy lifting and is rewarded with a cast that absolutely nails it. As polar opposite siblings who share an unbreakable bond, Chris Pine and Ben Foster are magnetic; the former a level-headed brooder with the weight of the world on his shoulders, the latter an unpredictable live wire who would gladly kill for his younger brother. On the other side of the fence, Jeff Bridges brings his A-game as a sardonic law-enforcement veteran who is equal parts intelligent and stubborn, terrifically supported by an understated Gil Birmingham as his oft-tormented partner. Most impressively the film doesn't seem to pass judgment on any of the characters (or at least not until late in the piece), allowing them to exist without labelling them good or bad; they all have parts of themselves that fit into both categories. Director David Mackenzie also deserves a lot of praise, as he sublimely balances the need for a tight and tense plot whilst simultaneously allowing his characters ample room to breathe and grow. Mackenzie also gets the very best out of his cinematographer Giles Nuttgens who delivers bold, sharp and stylish camera movements in addition to a level of photography (i.e., lighting and framing) that is as good as you'll see this year. Narratively powerful, visually mesmerising and backed to Nick Cave's transcendent soundtrack, Hell or High Water is one of the finest motion pictures of 2016.",

However, my biggest problem with this movie and why I walked out half way through was that the female characters in it were either helpless women put into submission by men with guns or they were women who would hop into bed with any good looking guy who comes along. After I left, it is possible that some strong women characters suddenly materialised but it would have been too little, too late. If the director of this movie has a high opinion of women he is doing his best to hide that fact.",

The start had no speaking just music (great musical score), of driving down a rural West Texas highway and the problems that plague the local population of farm owners by showing billboards of bank acquired land for sale accompanied by area economic collapse. Then it pans to two middle aged men who quickly mask themselves and walk into a small town bank. The two men, Chris Pine (Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 To Yuma) play \"The Howard\" brothers who live very different lives (one a jailbird and the other a family man rancher), but have an unbreakable bond towards family and will do anything to preserve their home, culture and life by robbing small town banks to pay off their recently deceased Mothers mortgage on their land. The viewers soon learn that this is a last option for the brothers, knowing that they need to pay back the banks within a week. They soon rob many banks quickly in the area and get the attention of the local Texas Rangers office and their old/ready to retire head ranger Jeff Bridges (Crazy Heart) who signs up using his experience as a detective to catch the local bandits. This movie becomes a cat and mouse game of bank robbers who have a running clock towards losing their home and an old Texas Ranger who wants one last hoorah before retiring. One side is going to win. Small characters like Katy Mixon, Marin Ireland, and Gil Birmingham (mostly television work) also portray their characters to perfection.\n\nChris Pine, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges all should win an Academy Award for their performances and this movie should at least be nominated for the best of the 2016-2017 season. Please go see it! Thank me later.",

            "content": "Bank heist suspense thriller is the best film so far in 2016\n\nFew films can deliver everything to moviegoers seeking the most bang for their box office buck.  Drama and comedy, perhaps.  Maybe even some sentimental chick flick mixed in with a thrilling suspense story.  Now toss in a modern Western cowboy feature with risky bank robberies in the Lone Star State.  For a motion picture to invoke each of these film genres in the same movie, airtight scripts must come alive through magnificent screen performances.  \"Hell or High Water\" powerfully achieves both and is by far the best film I've seen this year!\n\nThe shear strength of \"Hell or High Water\" resides in one of the strongest ensemble casts of 2016 and an authentic, captivating story to tell.  Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges stars as a long in the tooth Texas Ranger named Marcus Hamilton, who desires to bring swift justice to the pair of bank bandits before his pending retirement. \n\nBridges may be the film's most accomplished and notable Hollywood face, but his performance is matched along every stretch of west Texas highway by a very formidable Ben Foster (\"Lone Survivor\"). Riding shotgun to Foster's volatile Tanner Howard character is none other than \"Star Trek Beyond\" captain Chris Pine, portraying Tanner's younger brother Toby.  Together this trio play a game of cat and mouse, with viewers hoping no losers emerge in the end.  Credit the veteran Bridges for bringing out the career film bests for both Foster and Pine.\n\nThis film may be promoted as two brothers robbing banks, however, it's more about two give-and-take relationships.  These dueling bonds consist of one representing the law with Bridges' and his Texas Ranger sidekick, the other a brotherhood of outlaws raised in an abusive household.  One rapport the culmination of years serving together and the other a result of years spent apart.\n\nWielding a razor-sharp script from Taylor Sheridan (who wrote last year's phenomenal \"Sicario\" screenplay), \"Hell or High Water\" backs up to their getaway car with deeply satisfied theater audiences in close chase.  And combined with remarkable cinematography brandishing vast lands and small town life, \"Hell or High Water\" has confidently ordered all other 2016 films to get down on the floor and not move. At least for now.  \n\nIn 2012, \"Hell or High Water\" earned The Black List award for the most liked motion picture \"screenplay not yet produced\" from voters consisting of studio and production company executives. Historically, over 25% of the screenplays making The Black List have later earned an Oscar nomination, including; \"Argo\", \"American Hustle\", \"The King's Speech\", \"Slumdog Millionaire\", \"Spotlight\" and \"The Revenant\".  Not bad company.  \n\nIs \"Hell or High Water\" a shoo-in for an Academy Award nomination come January?  You can bank on it.\n\nGrade: A+",

            "content": "Hell or High Water is a no-holds barred, modern-day western, that masterfully weaves a layered and powerful crime story that is quite honestly; the best Coen Brothers film I've ever seen that they had no part in. The style, writing, cinematography, and script definitely owe a lot to films like Blood Simple and No Country For Old Men, but it certainly stands on its own! The film centers on two brothers, played brilliantly by Chris Pine and Ben Foster, who begin robbing the banks that have screwed their family over in an attempt at a Robin Hood-style revenge while a grizzled, Texas Ranger played by Jeff Bridges, pursues. Chris Pine and Ben Foster have immaculate chemistry together and though it's great to see a rougher side to Pine, Ben Foster steals this entire movie as the unstable side of the equation who's already done time in prison and will not go back. Jeff Bridges is also the best he's been in years here, using a Southern drawl not dissimilar to his delivery in True Grit, and his best moments are the playful banter he has with his partner, played by Gil Birmingham who is definitely the break-out actor here! The film is directed by David Mackenzie, who's made a couple films prior, but this will clearly be his break-out film and he deserves much praise for crafting an air-tight film that never stopped surprising me. The script is written by Taylor Sheridan, who also wrote Sicario, and features much of the same grit and realism while crafting some truly bad-ass scenarios for the characters to take part in. This is not a super fast-paced film, it spends time developing its very strong characters, but when the bullets do fly, the tone completely shifts and you will be holding your breath during the shoot-outs, car chases, and pretty much the entire climax. I absolutely loved this film and it really proves that the script is key, and you don't have to to attempt over-blown action and A-list movie stars to get the job done. Hell or High Water is a flawless film that will stand out for years to come, and I cannot wait to watch it again!",

Worst of all, the film's \"solution\" for the protagonist's poverty revolves around the discovery of oil on his property.  This is 2016!  Oil prices are so low that existing oil wells are shutting down...not opening up to make new millionaires.  Also the big oil industry is in North Dakota now.   Why on earth is this film set in Texas 2016???  If you want to write a sob story about Texas, then make it about bad traffic or set it back in time 100 years!",

Jeff Bridges plays Marcus Hamilton, a wily Texas Ranger who is about to retire, hunting two bank robbing brothers, Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Payne and Ben Foster) who are hoping to raise enough money to save their family farm which is under threat of foreclosure from the bank they're robbing.\n\nPine and Foster are a superb double act as chalk and cheese brothers but the pair are eclipsed by Bridges who puts in a career best performance for which he's likely to get nominations come award season. In addition to some memorable supporting roles, edgy script and dark humour; the striking visuals of long flat landscapes, empty skies and hardscrabble communities together with an expansive, melancholic soundtrack, beautifully depicts a blighted Texas and of an age gone by.\n\nWhist the plot is pretty conventional, grizzly cops and outlaw siblings with violent tempers are hardly a novelty, Hell Or High Water is a riveting heist movie with action and drama that maintains the suspense with the audience never knowing where they stand. One of the best films of the year, a new Western classic and an award contender.",

            "content": "The modern American western film has got a makeover over the past decade, with works of art like 'No Country for Old Men' earning praise from critics and attendance at the box office. In CBS Film's 'Hell or High Water,' the best and worst aspects of West Texas are highlighted as two brothers rob banks and make bank.\n\nChris Pine and Ben Foster tag-team as amateur bandits in the film, cruising through dusty plains in search of easy target branches of the Texas Midlands Bank. The reason? To grab enough cash to ensure their deceased mother's ranch does not fall into foreclosure and be claimed by the bank. The plot is a great example of the dog-eat-dog cycle that can result in this kind of a \"wild wild west,\" \"anything goes\" environment, and the accompanying screenplay clearly conveys this. The aforementioned actors bring their A-game, with Foster giving a particularly convincing performance thanks to his 'bad boy' persona. But it is the legendary Jeff Bridges who steals the show as his role as nearly-retired Lubbock sheriff Marcus Hamilton.\n\nIn addition to the solid story and potentially award nomination-worthy acting, 'High Water' is a classically told drama that benefits from its simpleness. At the heart of the film is the concept of family, and the lengths to which some will go to ensure the lives of their children are better than their own are. Pine's character helps this come across, as he is seen as a sympathetic figure despite his criminality. Also, the duality between him and his brother is stark, which is perhaps the reason they make a successful team. But it is the dialogue that really brings everything together, with Bridges' quips and rifle barrel banter adding enough flare.\n\nWhile 'Hell or High Water' likely won't win many awards thanks to a likely crowded field during the fall and winter, it's a strong, small-budget effort that should be highly regarded.",

I realize now that it was intentional. You get a feel for the pace and tone as the movie goes along.\nI will say the pace is....Texan.  Not slow, but a bit drawn out, and since it's set in Texas, this too must be intentional.  Beautifully calculated mixed with the most unusual yet stunning music, scenery, and humor.  I was laughing at some very inappropriate jokes, but I couldn't help it!  They all had some memorable and witty one liners.\nDid I mention the scenery?  The sky. I've always said the best thing about Texas is how huge the sky is.  You can see this in the film, several times.  That with the sweat, flies, music, and bank robbing, make it a real \"western\".\nOh, the acting-I almost forgot to talk about it because it was so good, I didn't feel like any of them were acting, I just felt like I was there. Taken from my real day to day crap and plopped in the middle of Texas on a hellish day 'bout ta have me sum fun.  And that's all and everything I want in a movie.",

No matter what the criteria, Hell or High Water fits. Sure, it's not the typical period piece fare we normally get from the genre, but it's a wonderfully old-fashioned yarn that would've been a hit in most bygone eras. Only an \"indie\" by the most basic description, its qualitative and crowd-pleasing reach much exceeds its financial grasp. Boasting funny, enthralling, and character-filled fun from start to finish, this unconventional cowboy chronicle is the movie we've wanted all year.\nIt's the story of the bank-robbing Howard brothers (Pine, Foster) and the nearly-retired lawman (Bridges) who's hot on their tales. The script is perfect, from the dialogue to the plotting to the characters to the themes. The simplicity of its cat-and-mouse setup allows the thematic and ethical complexities to unravel as the story does, instead of forcing it through hackneyed exposition. Touching on topics like the dangers of nostalgia, flawed justice, colonialism, and western heroism, its thematic richness is only matched by its penetrating visuals.\nWith anti-hero films filling the cinematic landscape nowadays, this is more a \"pro-human\" film. We find ourselves \"rooting\" for everyone, not because they're necessarily \"justified\", but because we know them. Director MacKenzie is a proven actors-director, and the performances here are utterly naturalistic and masterful. Along with a wonderful soundtrack and grimily stellar sets and costumes, it's an enveloping viewing experience you feel like you're living. As entertainingly cool as it is penetratingly artful, HoHW is far-and-away my favorite film of 2016.",

It had a Western, Neo Noir feel.  Great acting throughout led by Chris Pine, Ben Foster, Gil Birmingham and the great Jeff Bridges.  They bring their characters to life and help make the story more believable and real.   \n\nThere were some great comedic spots, mainly between the marshals, mixed with some thrilling action sequences.  It had a gritty, real-life feel thanks to the setting of a dusty, small town in West Texas.  The cinematography was great, with more than a few wonderful shot selections.\n\nThe only thing I disliked about this film is that it felt like something was missing.  I can't put my finger on it, but to me the film isn't perfection.

            "content": "This is the second movie I have seen by writer Taylor Sheridan who also wrote the best film I saw last year, Sicario. The film is as dusty and desolate as the west Texas towns it features. It stars Jeff Bridges as a ruggedly ragged, past his prime Texas Ranger who needs the thrill of one last manhunt before he is put out to pasture. His performance is subtle and powerful, proving again that he is one of the best actors working today. Chris Pine (Star Trek's Captain Kirk) plays Toby, the older and more rational brother of thrill seeking Ben Foster's Tanner, two men forced by the many failures in their lives into robbing banks.\n\nThe brothers are on a desperate quest to steal and launder enough money from several small town bank branches to pay off the reverse mortgage their dying mother took out before the bank repossesses their family ranch and the rich oil deposits that lie beneath it. The brother's know their mother was taken advantage of by the same banks that they now steal from. Toby's meticulous plan to rob the banks is slowly unraveled as his uncontrollable brother ratchets up the violence and risk after each successive robbery.\n\nThe cinematography is unflinching in showing us a dying American culture.  Small towns are filled with payday loan stores, shuttered businesses and the hopelessness of people with no future. The only ones profiting from this desperation are the financial institutions that use poverty to their advantage to squeeze the last remaining value out of people with no other options.\n\nThis film is a metaphor for the struggle between the ever declining American middle and lower class folks who slip deeper and deeper in debt and the financial institutions who legally shake them down for every last nickel and then leave them destitute. One steals with impunity and is protected by the laws it pays politicians to write, the other steals for survival and faces certain death or imprisonment if captured.\n\nIt is ultimately a story of brotherhood, both blood and badge, of failure and redemption, and of repayment of debts owed. It is a modern day Robin Hood tale without a happy ending. In a season of sequels and blockbusters, this small, quiet film portrays the despondency of small town America and it's need to grasp onto something, anything, that gives it hope. Even if that hope is in the form of yet another smooth talking rich guy who will smile and shake their hands while he steals their future and pads his own pockets (Yeah, I figured out a way to criticize Trump with my review).\n\nHell or High Water - A",

Things quickly turn serious as they are hunted by the area sheriff Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). While I wasn't quite as in love with it as the critics' consensus, the film holds it own with solid quality.\n\nWatching Hell Or High Water wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable without the solid cast. Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster were amazing bringing in some of the strongest performances I've seen this year. Bridges' character Marcus is on his way out the door as sheriff, but you get the feeling he's been doing nothing but speaking his mind (in a non-pc way) long before he knew he was retiring. He's extremely stubborn, not knowing how to let things go. Five minutes with Marcus on-screen and you can probably name someone in your life just like him. He's relatable while Foster's character Tanner is completely off his rocker. He's the guy you see coming and you cross the street, that person you know that asks you to hang out but you avoid them at all costs because you know how the night's going to end up. While Tanner is the type of person that has never run across any trouble that he didn't like, he's also endearing to a certain extent as his sole purpose is to help out his brother.\n\nMy one gripe with the movie is that the action fizzles in certain spots. Mind you, it's not supposed to be an action movie so I wasn't grossly disappointed, but I expected slightly more from a movie that has a lot to do with bank robberies. Again, not the end of the world, I just want to make sure I tame expectations ahead of time.\n\nAt the end of the day, the movie is not about the action but about the relationships between brothers and cops which you come to learn isn't really all that different. Brothers, just like cops, always tend to have each others' backs even when one hates what the other does. In one scene, Tanner finds himself in trouble with two guys at a gas station. Toby scolds Tanner for putting himself in such a position, but not before he beats the crap out of one of the guys and causes the other guy to run away. Meanwhile, Marcus' constant ribbing of his partner Alberto is a typical sign of love and respect. At first you think Marcus is a flat-out racist, but you quickly come to understand that he's trying to pass the sheriff torch in his own way. The insults he throws at Alberto are not just funny, but, in a weird way, a little touching.\n\nHell Or High Water is highly entertaining even without big-budget action sequences. I give it an 85.",

The thing that Hell or High Water had in spades, that every other film I saw in a theater this summer lacked, is well-developed interesting characters. They managed to make me care about every single main character, and sympathize with them all. There are few stories that I can remember where one character is pursuing another and I both want the pursuit to be successful, but also don't want the targeted character to get caught. That kind of internal conflict is such a complex and fascinating combination of emotions, that it takes a truly special film to give me that experience. The plot itself is revealed slowly, which keeps you dialed in and watching intently for what will happen next. I love that the movie found it more important to spend the early scenes establishing why we should like Chris Pine and Ben Foster rather than why they are doing what they are doing. It's a clever plan when they finally reveal everything, and it helped me to connect with them even more. Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham were spectacular, and their teasing banter back and forth was delightful. In many ways they act like a set of brothers, in order to perfectly mirror the brothers they are pursuing. The relationships between all of the characters comes across as very authentic, because this is how real people act with their coworkers, family, and so forth. When I left the theater I thought \"Man, that was a good movie.\" But as I've had more time to sit with it I keep recalling scenes that I loved, moments that impacted me, lines that made me laugh, and so much more. Hell or High Water exceeded all of my expectations and is easily one of my favorite films of 2016.",

I like how unfair the movie ends up being to those in it that really shouldn't be the ones getting the short end.  I'm not sure if this will end up on any Oscar lists, but the acting is top notch and so is the writing.  Jeff Bridges can't seem to play anything but an old wrangled up weird talking southern dude anymore, but it works for this flick that is for sure.

This could have been bad sound in the theater, but it seemed like there was still a lot of mumbling. There were many scenes that could have been done without, lots of sitting around on porches drinking beer and looking off into the horizon that didn't add much. The performances of Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster were solid, but everyone else seemed a bit unsure of themselves or who their characters were supposed to be. There were also a few jarring changes of pacing and tone that stood out, and scenes where you could see what kind of tension or suspense they were going for, but for some reason, it just doesn't quite land. Anyway, I love this genre of neo-western, and I hope more movies get made in this vein.",

It's the voice of of the characters that really sets the film apart. So few film writers have the same level of voice as do playwrights. It is due to that voice that this film about two bank robbing brothers stands out and above any bank heist or Western genre films from recent memory. Set in the recession-plagued dust of West Texas two brothers set to robbing branches of the bank that is set to foreclose on the land they grew up on. \n\nFoster has the showier role as the loose-cannon brother with a criminal history. He is afforded shades of character in both his love for his brother and the unexpected backstory that conflicts with his love of crime. Foster has a tendency to overact and that is still true here, but Mackenzie keeps him reigned in enough so that he doesn't topple the deliberate pace of the film. Pine plays the other brother who is motivated by love of family. It'll get less attention, but Pine turns off the smarm and seems lived-in with his soft-spoken Toby determined and cautious as the jobs grow more dangerous.\n\nThe authorities are hot on their heels, as the brothers only rob drawers in denominations of 20 and under. The cat and mouse factor is keyed in by about to retire Jeff Bridges. One last case and all that jazz. The trickiest part of the film is balancing the humor (because it does have a few good laughs) from Bridges' politically incorrect Ranger without it becoming a distraction. His partner is Mexian and Native American, and nigh a scene goes by without Bridges' character making a crack about it. It seems that it's there to make a point about these old ideas and old places dying away. His partner Alberto, is shown being hurt by the comments, and in turn Bridges seems hurt that his \"humor\" isn't found funny. It does enough to humanize Alberto (and the added bonus of a strong performance from Birmingham) that it plays as a critique of Old West dying in the face of New West.\n\nAs Toby and Tanner close in on their final goal (which isn't fully revealed until well into the film) everything culminates into one very well-staged shootout. Real stakes are present, and the filmmaking never falters. Mackenzie's opening long-shot is a panoramic beauty, and really sets the stage for the intentional pace and explosions of unexpected and visceral violence. And for a Scot he does a great job of making Texas a character in the film. From the vistas and dust to the running gag of everyone having a gun. Throw in a score from Western specialist Nic Cave & Warren Ellis and you have familiar elements rearranged just enough, and with enough expertise it feels new and exciting.\n\nOutside of some obvious ADR and the wince-inducing racist jokes, there is only a few other passages of dialogue that hit a bit on the nose (white people taking Indian land, banks taking it back). It also sticks the landing in the fatalistic ways you expect, and in a way you may not. It's a gem of a film that deserves to be more than an indie favorite. A victory for mid-budget adult-film making.",

This film was not in my anticipated list at all, I was not even remotely excited to watch this when the first trailer came out...then the reviews came in. With such high ratings, I had to see what all the fuss was about and I can honestly say the high ratings are justified. Hell or High Water is so close to perfection, so close! What brings this film to those heights you ask? The acting. All three main actors in the film are perfect and to be honest all deserve nominations for atleast\u00a0one award in any ceremony. Jeff Bridges? A Legend. Chris Pine? Finally getting a chance to show his acting chops. Ben Foster? Whoa now, completely transformed himself (2016 has not been a bad year for him). What helped them was the script which had me transfixed from the first section of dialogue, it had everything from witty humour and banter between the characters\u00a0to emotional tension between the brilliant brotherly bond (dare you to say that ten times in a row!) of Foster and Pine. The direction from David Mackenzie was solid and the cinematography was sublime with some really creative shots when following vehicles. Excellent wide shots to let the audience take in the Texan environment. I won't spoil the film, but there is a scene in the movie that is what I call an \"Oh My God!\" moment (a scene so shocking, I\u00a0literally mouth those words out), did not see it coming whatsoever and I don't think anyone else did, brilliantly executed. The score was also appropriate, with country vibes that suit the Texas locale.\u00a0I say it\u00a0is close to perfection, the only flaw I found was that the script allows the characters to have too many conversations that do not further the plot. Whilst this is good for character development, too much of it and it starts to slow the pace down. Overall, Hell or High Water is a near perfect crime/drama with powerhouse performances (particularly Ben Foster) and a sublime script, even if the dialogue is bit excessive at times.\n\n- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",

The film really takes you to an interesting, if not exotic place in America.\nFilm reminds me very much of the morally ambiguous desperation of Bonnie and Clyde, this time in post-2008 recession times. \n\nThe film moves thoughtfully and I think realistically through its story.  Thankfully, for my tastes, it substitutes gratuitous movie violence for a very believable realistic series of events. \nHell or High Water will probably go down as one of the top 5 most critically acclaimed films of 2016.",

It takes about 10 minutes for the film's plot to kick in, but once it does, it's a manic ride from start to finish. The plot goes pretty deep, clawing at you with questions about our social landscape pitting the rich versus the \"99%,\" what's (morally) right versus what is \"just\" for someone else's situation, and how loyal one could be to a loved one's cause. Almost all of the performances across the board in the flick are unanimously praiseworthy, in particular those of Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges. I have never been a big fan of Pine's work in the past, but I have to give him many props here for pleasantly shocking me with his role. Jeff Bridges is in fine form, as well (and hopefully, another potential Oscar nomination won't be ruled out). Ben Foster is a little over-the-top, but provides a nice counter balance to Chris Pine's calm, levelheaded characterization. It is definitely worth your time to check it out if you are interested at-all in seeing this movie, and comes with a high recommendation from myself. The flick is one of my favorites of the year (only behind another recent hit, \"Captain Fantastic\").",

While this will always be known as the film where Chris Pine shows us that he can do more than squint convincing as Captain Kirk and his is a nuanced and quietly powerful performance; there is also an immensely watchable Jeff Bridges who plays the tough Marshall in pursuit, and just because he can do the role in his sleep, we should not take him for granted. Scenes of his bantering with his deputy (played by Gil Birmingham) are funny, heart-warming/breaking and pay off towards the end of the film in an emotional and poignant fashion. Deliberately desolate and desperate yet peppered with astute observations of our times, the beautifully crafted film admittedly has a few wobbly or \"posey\" moments but in the end I found myself totally invested in a film that was written, directed and shot with a poetic and picturesque sentimentality that never boils over into hysterical melodrama.",

            "content": "This is not a bad film. It is certainly entertaining enough and well acted enough.\nIt is just not a terribly good film- I think average would be a better term. There is somewhat a lame attempt in  subplot to connect the awful wall street bailout with the working class poor living in Texas- willing to do anything to pay the mortgage- but let's face it- the brothers played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster would have probably robbed banks with or without the bailout- if they didn't- you wouldn't have a movie. If this film had been released in the '70s with a lower budget and a bunch of unknown actors- it would have been a fairly average drive in film-nothing more. You add the great Jeff Bridges to the mix and the sadly underused Gil Birmingham and you might have something. Of the two brothers Chris Pine gives a great performance as the moody younger brother. His performance is even keeled and convincing- especially in the last scene.  Ben Foster on the other hand, I did not feel was convincing at all. I have sadly known too many excons who have done 10+years in prison... and Ben Foster just did not have it down. He was too wild- too free with his movements.  People who have been locked up that long- do not wear it like a badge of honor. They generally are instutionalized and cagey and their movements are more measured and precise. They can instill fear without having to act all badass. They don't have to prove anything. I think this movie would have been better if PIne had played the moody excon and Foster had played the younger brother. Pine had it down and was more believable in his role and would have portrayed an excon more accurately. That being said- the movie is worth seeing for the last 15 minutes where Bridges demonstrates once again his versality and skill  as an actor- even playing the cliched wrinkled southern lawman. A better film with him in it would be 1992's American Heart- a much more powerful film with an even better performance. Compared to most of the crap released this summer- Hell of High Water soars.",

The easiest way for me to describe it would be: \"No Country for Old Men meets The Big Short\"...\n\nThe acting in this movie is excellent. From the leads, to the supporting characters, everyone is fantastic. There is also great chemistry among the two main duos that are portrayed in this movie. The brothers, played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster, feel like they are actual brothers. They tease, they banter, they hoarse around, with the realism of real brothers. There relationship is well fleshed out, and our attachment to them grow as the movie progresses. The other amazing pair is Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham, as Texas Rangers. Their exchanges and interactions are captivating and fun to watch, which also makes the viewer grow more attached to them. While everyone performs well, special mention should be given to the Jeff Bridges. His presence and charisma were magnetic, and make every scene he was in twice as enjoyable.\n\nThe script is also excellent. It deals with themes that are rarely talked about, both in movies and in the news, but that has a devastating and sometimes deadly effect on people's lives: predatory loans and poverty. This movie treats these themes very cleverly, and brings into the spotlight issues that needs to be addressed. In addition to it's main themes, this movie also tackles other obscure topics few people speak of such as the savage treatment of the native Americans, or the less savage but still terrible treatment of war veterans. All these elements combine to deliver a story that draws you in and has you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next.\n\nFinally, what would be a movie without great cinematography. The camera flows smoothly, making everything easy to follow, it offers some beautiful views of the New Mexican country side, it all just... works. There is no choppy editing, no shaky cam inferno, it's just perfect.\n\nConclusion: I could write for several paragraphs how amazing this movie is, but I'd rather forgo that and just tell you to GO SEE IT. This is a beautiful and powerful movie on a subject that is rarely touched upon, and performed by actors who draw you into story. This is a film that will no doubt receive Oscar nominations. If you appreciate good films, Comancheria is for you.",

This was way too good of a\nfilm to not be in top shelf movie watching mode.\nProbably not an original premise of family members going\non a crime spree to save the family farm. Set in destitute\nWest Texas, surprisingly divorced calm & kind brother played\nby Chris Pine and his wild, ex-con, living on the\nedge brother Ben Foster, are the ring leaders in a\nlocal bank robbing spree. These brothers are as difference as\nnight and day in every sense but clearly love each other which\nadds nicely to the movies tension.\nThe family homestead which is owned by their recently deceased\nMom and the home to Pine's (brother Toby) ex-wife and 2 kids is\nnear foreclosure. However, the brothers also learn that the\nland is loaded with oil and the selling of the rights can\nyield a lifetime of comfort.\nSo the brothers set off to knock off several smaller branches\nof the local (Texas) Midland's bank who happen to hold the\nloan papers on the farm. The notion of robbing the same bank\nthat is trying to screw them out of the family homestead helps\nthem stay focused.\nBut not surprisingly wild brother Tanner just keeps pushing\nthe envelope and clearly has a death wish. The lead Texas\nRanger following them is brilliantly played by Jeff Bridges.\nYes, he could have doubled as Dick Tracy foil \"Mumbles\" but\ncandidly, it was tough to understand a number of the characters\nand their heavy west Texas, stiff lip talking styles. Bridges is\nan olde time Ranger with excellent instincts, patience and\nvast experience dealing with locals (and anticipating their\ntendencies).\nBut at the end of the day, a brilliant sound track and rich\ncinematography of the folks and the terrain, create a special\nfilm that will generate lots of buzz.\nThis was a very well constructed movie and script that has\nlots of upsides and will generally be enjoyed by most. Highly\nrecommend seeing on a big screen. At 102 minutes, a\nspecial cast and a tight story, this film is a winner.",

This is one of the best movies of 2016.",

It's a well made drama/thriller, that while certainly not surprising, satisfies.",

Chris Pine and Ben Foster are the two newly-reunited brothers who start robbing small West Texas branches of the bank that is about to foreclose on their family's ranch, with soon-to-retire Texas Ranger Jeff Bridges hot on their tails. Everything about this film is master class - the intricate story, the complex characters, exceptional acting, the humor, the score and especially the cinematography, which captures the gritty, desolate West Texas setting as no film has done before. Oh - and Chris Pine's hair - simply amazing. It will be a crime if this film is not justly rewarded come Oscar season. It is one of the year's best. A must see. A+",

            "content": "This film kind of came out of nowhere, only seeing the trailers for it a couple of weeks ago, but the immediate hype was intriguing so I was eager to watch this as soon as it was released. First thing I do after watching this is head straight for the shop and grab myself some bottled American lager (well, brewed under licence but it's the closest I'm gonna get.) I get home, crack one open and sit there thinking about what I've just seen. \n\nFirst and only film I've seen of director David McKenzie was his grim British prison drama, Starred Up, which was incredibly good. And I was mesmerised by last year's Sicario which is written by the same Taylor Sheridan so it's a win-win combination already without adding the cast. \n\nThe story delves deeper than a couple of brothers committing bank robberies across west Texas, it's almost political and opens the field to a broader history in a realistic manner, but leaves you sitting on the fence with regard to who's the bad or good guy and in fact, proves either can be both giving the circumstance. \n\nWe follow the Howard brothers Tanner and Toby, Tanner played ruthlessly by Ben Foster as the impulsive, trigger-happy ex-con and Chris Pine playing Toby, the struggling, better, younger brother. Foster being a worn monster truck of brutal force whilst Pine is a filthy aged muscle car. \n\nHot on their trail is soon-to-be retired Texas ranger Marcus Hamilton played masterfully by Jeff Bridges, and his partner, who Hamilton continually ridicules about his heritage, Alberto Parker, played by Twilight's shape-shifting wolf, Gil Birmingham. \n\nThe relationships within both pairs are highly captivating and with a strong sense of realism. Their performances being some of the best I've seen all year, and yes, Bridges ultimately delivers but that's expected, Pine is equally amazing, shredding all skin and hint of Capt. Kirk but Foster is the star here. Maybe slightly biased, liking Foster since 3:10 To Yuma as Charlie Brown, his portrayal is ferociously compelling. You can't help but like the character and I suppose that's the beauty of this film, all the characters have they're own likability, making it harder to choose who's side you'll be on just hanging in there for the outcome. \n\nThe script is amazing, superbly written with some classic clever quotes, giving Ben Foster some of the best lines in the movie, actually providing elements of comedy. The confrontations in particular are enthralling, making great cinema. Tense, powerful with a perfectly balanced contrast between the action and downtime, the only constant is the dusty ambience that leaves you with a gritty taste, I could almost feel the dirt on my skin. \n\nIt's excellence doesn't end there, with a flawless choice of veterans of west American dramas Nick Cave and Warren Ellis who's collaboration has been on Lawless and The Proposition; and independently Ellis doing an eerie score for The Road and Cave composing a haunting one for The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford. The perfect pairing of score and soundtrack gives the film an air of melancholy, a sober tone that belongs to this story. \n\nGreat cinematography, especially the panning shots, superb script writing and brilliantly violent. Accompanied with an excellent score and great performances from all. Perfectly paced from start to finish. This is a modern western, a must see movie, Hell or high water. \n\nRunning Time: 10\nThe Cast: 10\nPerformance: 10\nDirection: 10\nStory: 10\nScript: 10\nCreativity: 8\nSoundtrack: 9\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the outstanding performances from all four! Foster, Bridges, Pine, Birmingham and for excellent direction. \n\n97% 10/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

Chris Pine's blank stares into the distance and Jeff Bridges' unfunny jokes getting lauded, yet Ben Foster had the only good performance among the major characters. Almost all the banter and folksy aphorisms felt contrived. The cinematography is brilliant at times, but does not offer much food for thought outside the heavy-handed, repetitive conceit of decaying blue collar America. \n\nA pretentious, grossly overrated knock-off of the Coen brother's modern western it's getting compared too... speaking of western, the gunfights were awful, often poorly shot (despite much of the rest of the movie's cinematography being admittedly brilliant), and barely believable at the best of times. I don't need lots of gunfighting in a western, but there is an expectation for the slow build to the big gunfight to pay off in a spectacular way, a la Unforgiven or Butch & Sundance. No Country for Old Men broke from this trope in the death of Llewellyn and the retreat of the far better Sheriff character, Tommy Lee Jones, but it was unsettling and interesting--this climax is predictable and serviceably shot at the best of times, however Ben Foster plays it very well, like everything in the movie, actually--again, people are way off the mark in my opinion heaping all their praise on Pine and Bridges.\n\nA good looking drama with mostly decent performances despite the often unnatural aphorism-laden back-and-forths, but a standout picture in a couple respects--it doesn't take much to stand out this season I guess.",

It has a  nice, gradual build of tension throughout, and although it has many of  the tropes of the genre it's more that it acknowledges them rather than  uses them blatantly as they never make the film predictable.\n\nThis is the best Chris Pine performance I've ever seen, and he and Ben  Foster have excellent chemistry as the bank robbing brothers.  Balancing  that out are Jeff Bridges's sheriff and Gil Birmingham deputy. Their  dynamic is interesting, as the deputy's respect for the sheriff always  shows through despite the later's near constant racism which itself  balances carefully on that thin line of not being hateful, just grossly  misguided.\n\nThe score is maybe a little heavy handed at times, but  the cinematography is gorgeous, with not a single wasted shot in the  film. While always tense, there's a surprising amount of well placed humour as well so that tension never overwhelms. Simply put, this film is highly recommended.",

Yet we are given valid reasons to hate these financial institutions - the source of foreclosed houses and crushed dreams. Are these brothers a modern day Bonnie and Clyde?

Rooting for these guys is similarly problematic, but this is a tale with even deeper shades of gray. There are so many surprises. One violent altercation inadvertently provides a cogent defense for carrying a concealed weapon. The mentality of the vigilante perspective is presented so rationally, I was a bit taken aback. There's sort of an odd mix of emotion that fluctuates wildly between compassion and disgust for these lawbreakers. Sympathy turns to aversion over the course of the narrative. It's the way these little unforeseen vignettes plays out that make this character study so captivating.  One of the most noteworthy dramas of 2016.\n\nfastfilmreviews.com",

Chris Pine, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges are all absolutely incredible and they all give some of the best performances of their careers. Chris Pine and Ben Foster are incredibly talented, and it's on full display here. it's very solidly crafted, tense, taut, exciting and just an incredibly made film. David Mackenzie, who is the director, has a real attention to detail and is an immense talent to watch out for. it doesn't let up from its first shot until all the way to its final shot. with that, it's incredibly well paced and I was never bored throughout the entire movie. also, the scenery of Texas worked so well for the movie, it felt like I was in the Texas heat with these characters. the script by Taylor Sheridan, (who also wrote the fantastic Sicario), fleshes out this story with well developed characters and rich, interesting dialogue that kept me invested. the violence is brutal and all of a sudden and when it happens, I was actually disturbed by it because I felt so much for these characters and when something happened to them, I actually cared which I haven't been able to say for a lot of movies this year. Hell Or High Water is an impeccably made, brilliantly acted and written, modern style western thriller that is easily one of the greatest films I've seen all year.",

It reminded me of 'Mud', because both films had high scores on RT, but nothing too great on IMDB.  Both are easy films to like and most reviewers give a positive review, but most people don't love either film. I enjoyed all three performances from the leads and loved the dialogue, especially from Jeff Bridges.  Taylor Sheridan, who wrote this and Sicario, is becoming one of the better new writers in Hollywood (he was also great as an actor in Sons of Anarchy) and I'll look forward to more films from him.  Overall, 'Hell or High Water' is a very solid and entertaining film, but it's nothing too special for me to give it a great review.",

            "content": "This movie was very very good. However, in my opinion it has a major flaw or two. They didn't need to rob banks to pay off the ~$40,000. Even if we assume that everything happened all at once (the mom died, they found oil the same day, and the money was due in just a few days.....which I would argue is unlikely) they still could have gone to a private investor for a loan, hell even another bank. They could've probably negotiated with PayDay loans or any number of institutions. Since they're expecting $50,000/month of income, it would've been easy to secure a loan with their proof of accounts receivable plenty of time to spare. And they make Chris Pine out to be a very intelligent man (even clever enough to file his son's trust with the very same bank he owed money to so that the bank would be less cooperative with authorities). If Chris Pine's character is as smart as they make him out to be (the mastermind of the robberies, he definitely would've thought of that. And I don't even think it's fair to argue that even if they thought of that, that they still wanted to stick it to the bank for trying to \"rob\" them of their family's farm. Ben Foster's character--yes-- I could see him wanting to stick it to the bank, but not Chris Pine's character. There's a scene at the end where he tells Ben that he loves him, and I'd argue that Chris is too level headed and wouldn't put anyone he loved in a situation like that unless it was absolutely necessary. So this made me like the movie a little less. Chris is either smart or he isn't. Clearly he is. So he would've known to get a second financier, not a gun to rob banks.\n\nOne other problem is that during the last bank robbery, Chris Pine's character is shot, and would've definitely left behind blood at the crime scene. They could have compared the blood found at the crime scene to Ben Foster's character's blood. Simple DNA testing would quickly prove that the blood found at the scene of the crime would be a sibling of Ben Foster's character. (Siblings have extremely similar DNA). Then they could've gotten a warrant to check Chris Pine's characters blood to prove he was the other robber, and then he'd be in jail. The only way around this would be that it was sort of hard to see exactly when Chris Pine's character was shot (so maybe...maybe... he was shot in the truck, which was later lit on fire). So maybe there's no blood at the crime scene, but I think that's a stretch. So this is super nitpicky, and I will say I loved the movie. I just hate the fact that there's some big errors.",

            "content": "The summer movie season has never been known for its smaller films, but this summer has been pretty weak, as far as quality. Moviegoers began to hope for the more independent films to get wider releases in order to rejuvenate their love of film. Maybe it is just the fact that this summer has been so dour, but seeing Hell or High Water to cap off the summer of 2016 may just be the best thing for you. With a little bit of The Town and No Country For Old Men, this is a film that every movie lover will enjoy. It is small films like this that remind me why I love the film industry and that even the most under-the-radar films should be given a chance. Here is why I believe Hell or High Water to be one of the best films of the summer.\n\nStarring Chris Pine (Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma), Hell or High Water follows two brothers that rob banks in order to raise money to keep from losing their family ranch, after the passing of their mother. Divorced and wanting to take care of his kids, Toby (Pine) has many more things on his mind than just saving the ranch. This may seem like a been-there-done-that premise, but the fantastic performances truly make you buy into the harsh reality that these characters are facing and the chemistry between Foster and Pine leaps off the screen in a big way. From beginning to end, this film had me either on the edge of my seat or feeling emotional toward their next decision.\n\nWith a very quite tone throughout the course of this film, it all comes down to whether the editor holds long enough on certain takes and whether or not the performances are aces. Luckily, with a very slim score and editing that is perfect for the tone of this picture, Hell or High Water feels unlike any films I have seen this year. Sure, most of the great stories about bank robbers will eventually have down time, leaving room for character development, but there was just something about this script that felt very soothing when there was no high-octane action in play. That being said, when the action hits, it is incredibly engaging.\n\nWhile this film is more about building its characters than it is focussing on its action sequences to keep its audience entertained, Hell or High Water does have its share of thrills. From well-shot chase sequences to intense shootouts, everything you hope to see when going into this film is definitely present. Once again, the action in this film is elevated by the great character development throughout the film, making you actually care who lives and who dies in the final act. Almost everyone in this film is a crooked, but they all have their reasons for doing what they are doing, and it all comes to pass in the climax.\n\nIn the end, Hell or High Water benefits from a strong cast, including some great supporting roles from Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham. To some, this film may suffer from being a little too calming at times, making it feels slightly longer than its mere 102 minute running time, but its all worth it when the final act begins. Overall, this is a much better film than I think anyone was thinking it would be. Filled with terrific performances, thrilling action scenes, character development that feels real, and a score that is almost non-existent, making audiences quiet down as if they are actually sitting in a room with these characters, completely invested in their conversations. I loved every moment of Hell or High Water, even though it may have a few pacing issues here and there. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Bank robberies always make for a good movie opening. No matter how many I see, it always strikes me as just the right kind of jolt to kick a movie into gear. Ben Foster (Six Feet Under) and Chris Pine (Star Trek) play brothers Tanner and Toby Howard, respectively. Their targets are the Texas Midlands Bank snatching the front drawer cash from each one in the area. It makes for a simpler and quicker in and out versus hitting up the vaults. Tanner is the ex-con who was recently released from jail for shooting and killing their father. As you may assume, he's a bit reckless and sloppy when it comes to the heists. However, he's merely along for the joy ride. This is all Toby's idea. He owes child support to his ex-wife for their two sons. To top it off, Toby and Tanner's mother recently died. Mortgage payments need to be paid off on her ranch, which also happens to lie on an oil bed. Toby's not about to let her house fall into the hands of the bank. Hot on their trail are two Texas rangers. Marcus Hamilton (Bridges) is near retirement and sees this as his last big career achievement. He's partnered with Alberto Parker (Birmingham) whose Comanche heritage doesn't sit well with him.\n\nIn a summer full of blockbusters, sequels, comic book films, and plenty of others that just feel like rehashes, it's refreshing to see something of a limited budget rise above those films and reign as one of the summer's and year's best. On the outside, it looks like just a typical type western. I thought as much throughout the beginning wondering where the hook was and how is this any different. Then it dawned on me that that is the how it's different. We rarely see a western on the big screen anymore. It's almost like a dying breed of a genre. One of the last main stream westerns was True Grit, also starring Jeff Bridges. Hell or High Water is that old-fashioned cops and robbers type story, but the execution is done so simple and to the point, making it all the more effective. Unlike other bank robbery or heists type movies, this isn't about drugs or a larger government cover-up. It's a family story involving the love between two brothers and the love a father has for his two sons hoping to give them a better life than the one he was handed. Writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) always keeps the family dynamic at the forefront. He also plays into the old stereotype of cowboys versus Indians regarding the back and forth partnership of agents Hamilton and Parker. No specific time frame is given to suggest that it isn't a contemporary look at the racism that still permeates in these small towns.\n\nDirector David Mackenzie (Young Adam) has a top notch cast with no weak link among them. Ben Foster has played his fair share loose canons. Tanner Howard fits so well into that description that Foster can tap into that side of him so easily. He can let loose and make Tanner that fearless, loud, and unpredictable force of nature. Jeff Bridges also plays right into his wheelhouse. He fully embodies that aging and overweight sheriff out for one final take. He makes it so easy to hate the variety of racial slurs that come out toward his partner. Bridges has been playing these types of Southern characters his whole career, but they are roles I love seeing him in.\n\nEven though Foster and Bridges give exceptional performances, Pine slips in under the radar and gives the best performance of his career. He begs you to take notice, especially when you don't expect that next to the other two. It's easy for him to rely on his charm and dashing good looks in the Star Trek movies or even Into the Woods. When he tries to go outside of that it doesn't always work out. He led the true story, The Finest Hours, earlier this year from Disney, and it was a total bomb. Ben Foster also appeared in that, and I'm glad they were able to work together again in something far better. Sometimes I get the impression Pine tries too hard to shed his image and it doesn't always work. Hell or High Water is that exception. His character, Toby, is a rugged and simple kind of guy. Pine really sticks to that and keeps that motivation of providing for his sons at the heart of his character's journey. Toby and Tanner could easily be two stereotype characters, but Pine justifies his character's actions throughout the entirety of the film making the audience really root for him in the end.\n\nThroughout Hell or High Water, I kept thinking that this is such a simple concept but it's so engaging at the same time because David Mackenzie keeps it that way. There are no twists or turns, and he keeps things flowing very naturally. It's a slow burn type of movie that leads into a very intense climax. I forgot that Texas is a concealed carry type of state, which doesn't always bode well for our two bank robbers at any given point of the film. The score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis perfectly compliments the tone bringing you further into that lonesome desert feel. I've been disappointed in so many movies this year, but Hell or High Water is worth recommending for a wide audience. It's more than just a western as that family bond lassos you in. Despite the A-list cast, it needs that positive word of mouth to continue bringing audiences out to the theater. There were roughly forty to fifty people in the theater when I saw it on a Saturday afternoon. My husband went and saw Sausage Party at the same time, which played to an audience of ten people. That should give you some indication of how well it's doing.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Go see it, and I bet you'll be surprised at how much you enjoy it by the time the end credits roll.\n\nRATING: 4.5 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

            "content": "Following in the vein of Cormac McCarthy's post-modern westerns, Hell or High Water is a thoughtful, tense, and bloody elegy about two small time bank robbers in West Texas and a mirror pair of Texas Rangers who pursue them.  Despite the similarities and comparisons to No Country for Old Men, High Water has more in common with Killing Them Softly, as both are about two desperate men who make questionable robberies, experienced and cynical professionals who pursue them, people dying for relatively small amounts of money, deliberate and glacial storytelling, all to the backdrop of post-recession blue collar America in the midst of its death throes and plenty of blunt commentary blaming banks and the financial system for game of death we are currently witnessing.  But on a visceral level it manages to be quite engrossing and the stuff of solid adult entertainment.  Ya know?  The kind of movie we all claim to want more of in theaters but never actually bother to see or support.  Chris Pine plays a salt-of-the-earth everyman with a touch of cleverness.  Ben Foster has the most fun as his reckless, but lethal brother who epitomizes the soul of the movie.  In perfect casting, Jeff Bridges is an aging Texas Ranger with laconic wit and an able investigative mind.  And Gil Birmingham has his moments as his long suffering partner and is more pivotal to the message of the film than one may initially suspect.  All of the characters are immensely likeable and interesting, which makes it all the more tragic when it's time to kill a few of them off.  Hell or High Water is a badass movie that will manage to stick to your ribs long after you've seen it.  Highly recommended.",

With a tight knit story, award worthy performances, surprising amount of comedy, and an emotional payoff all make this one of the best surprises in recent years.\n\nSo much goes right in this film, but the main thing that makes this movie work is the writing in both story and dialogue from screenwriter Taylor Sheridan. The story here follows two brothers who are robbing banks and two Texas rangers are hunting them down. Sure, this is a vague description, but trust me when I say that a small description is all this needs. The story is fast paced and for once the dialogue actually means something. All the characters have lines that develop them, the setting,and further the story and make this movie more rounded and more fulfilling than you would think. There is a moment in this film that everyone in my theater audibly gasped and really showed how much you care for these characters Not only that but the ending of the film is very rewarding and well fitting, fully rounding out this film.\n\nThe cast here is also fantastic and is surely going to get accreditation towards award season. Chris Pine and Ben Foster play the brothers and they are absolutely phenomenal together, counteracting each other's weakness perfectly. Pine plays the more reserved brother as Foster is more outgoing. Their duality is flawless and both show how talented they are as actors. Jeff Bridges plays Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton and delivers his best performance in years. Bridges is so hilarious and equally heartbreaking that you can't help but cheer for him even though you love Pine and Foster's characters as well. Gil Birmingham plays Bridge's partner and he is just as fantastic as everyone else, delivering hilarious moments as well as deeply dramatic dialogue.\n\nThe direction in this movie is flawless and really makes this movie feel authentic. This film is directed by David Mackenzie and though you may not have heard of him before, you will after this movie. Every scene looks beautiful and crisp, complementing the setting and solidifies this as a modern day western. On top of that, Mackenzie shows his eye for action and suspense. there are moments in this film where you are on the edge of your seat and are at his mercy, waiting for the next plot twist. He structured this film in a way that you never get tired and are always enjoying this film. Basically, Mackenzie has made a huge statement here. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that this movie accomplishes something that not many do: an emotional payoff through its actors and storytelling. There are some deep thematic elements here that you notice the first time you see it and stay with you. Albeit certain mannerisms in the characters or the pitch perfect ending, but this movie genuinely takes you on a journey and once you see it you feel like you just saw something special.\n\nAll in all I adored Hell or High Water. This is a very small film but mighty in it's accomplishments on all fronts. This is a serious, exhilarating, often times funny, modern day western that makes you remember why movies are so great. I can not praise this enough and strongly urge everyone to find a theater this is playing and experience it for yourself.",

That tension, coupled with excellent characters & great acting, delivers on all fronts. I especially found the script & writing to be sharp & realistic. It wasnt drowned out by the usual Hollywood ethos of political correctness or preaching about some cause or agenda. There were plenty of opportunities to do just that but the story stay glued to the plot, stayed true to the characters, didnt waste time lecturing us, and doesnt insult your intelligence. The film makers just lay out the facts & tell the story. And they leave the judging to us. Highly Recommended.",

            "content": "A good man does bad things for a good reason; a bad man does bad things for a good reason;  a good man whose morals doesn't allow for bad things to happen for any reason, don't we all love films of this kind? Director David Mackenzie's latest film, feels like one of those films. Every once and a while a good crime drama that involves cops and bad guys who do robberies comes along and it entertains and thrills and you the viewer love seeing the chase and the blood that is shown and most of these type of pictures spill acts of heroism and vigilantism so well and with this independent entry, it pretty much covers all of what I just said. This is a simple meat-and-potatoes tale of bank heists and blood brothers, the sort of story that great directors from Kubrick and Altman to Arthur Penn and Tarantino have made their staple at one time or another. Like recent westerns such as The Rover, Slow West and True Grit, this film takes some interesting and unique approaches to this old genre. The story follows two brothers - an ex-con Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) and a divorced dad Toby Howard (Chris Pine). Toby has meticulously planned out their bank robbery spree. Tanner's goal is to save his family ranch from being foreclosed by the bank, so his boys and ex wife Debbie (Marin Ireland) can escape the \"disease\" of poverty. Tanner is along to support his brother and probably because he just enjoys the adrenaline rush. Soon enough, aging Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is on the trail of the boys, and his highly developed instincts and gut feelings annoy his mix breed partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) almost as much as Marcus' incessant and insensitive racial teases - a reminder of the days when buddies would verbally jab each other without the risk of class action lawsuits. One knows, amid the gunfire and violence, the cost of living in the fast lane is past due. There are no easy answers in this film. Where is the country financially and how do people get out of the hell they are in? How does a cattle farmer still have to deal with wildfires in the 21st century? The film is perfectly paced, as the narrative hits the nail & culminates in a crisp 101-minutes run time. The film begins with a punch & ends on the very same note. I was thoroughly engrossed by the story & how well it progressed. Working from a screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (scribe of last year's popular Sicario), Mackenzie sets his film in the Texas midlands, the last frontier against \"progress,\" as the few scattered denizens would call the encroaching destruction of their old-fashioned way of life. This is a film born out of people's hate for financial institutions. The great majority of us are in debt, fighting liens, repossessions, and looking on while the same companies that inundate us with statements get bailouts. Director David Mackenzie effectively captures the desperation of America's poor with his stark images of a Texas wasteland. Large billboards about mortgages and loans dot the dry rural landscapes, nicely filmed by Giles Nuttgens. Mr. Mackenzie's film is a poetic mood piece with intricate plotting and a narrative structure that keeps one riveted to the characters and their actions. There's some graffiti sprayed on the wall early in the film in a dusty town in West Texas that reads \"3 Tours in Iraq; no bailout for me.\" While I initially loved Sicario, there is very little personality in that film, not just in the characters but in the overall dialogue in the film. It all feels a little robotic and plot oriented, well this film is almost the complete opposite. This film is brimming with character, most specifically the Texans. There are so many great lines in this film, that don't feel added in or punched up. You also get a better understanding of the characters from these little phrases and one liners. The story itself puts the film in action/adventure territory with more than a hint of crime drama, so one's classification of the picture with the Western genre is probably more so by association with its West Texas and Oklahoma locations than the cowboy roots of the principals. The same could be said of \"No Country for Old Men\", so there's another likely comparison. There is a grim edge to the film, but it refuses to wallow in it. Instead, it is bleakly funny, fraught with little character foibles sure to get a chuckle or two out of any audience. Even in the tensest moments (and there are more than a few, be forewarned), there is a nevertheless a laid- back undercurrent. In large part, it's due to how easy the three leads slip into their characters and convey decades' worth of life and experience in their performances. It sounds odd in a gritty crime drama, but this is also a deeply funny film.  The relationship between the two rangers is fantastic and there are a few moments in the film so absurd and surreal that you can't do anything but laugh at the characters trying to adapt to the situation. It's also the sign of a brilliant script that laughter can be turned to shock and tears in the snap of a finger.  Also, I have to say, the writing for the side characters, some of whom are only in the film for their respective scenes is even better. This is the first time I have ever cared about some random waitress who is only in the film for 90 seconds because their writing is masterful. West Texas is a character unto itself with massive poverty, oil pumps on the horizon, dusty streets, rickety fences, and gun-toting citizens everywhere. Each of these elements is beautifully captured by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens (Dom Hemingway), as are the actual bank robberies and the quiet moments between brothers and Rangers partners. The cinematography captures the desolateness and sadness of the area of West Texas that the film is set in. There are also many wide shots, which looked like they were filmed with drones which also added to the beauty of the filming. The music also adds to the western feel of this film. Yes, the plot is predictable, the set-up contrived, and the film is a tad too leisurely told from the outset. But the haunting images and true-to-life characters are heartfelt and linger long after the film ends thanks to a terrific script, and taut direction. It's one of those films that's so finely crafted that you don't really notice its issues. The thing that makes this film as good as it is, is that it knows what it is and does not try to become something more than that. It is not a complicated film or one with a twist; you know where everyone stands at the end of the film and in a day and age when so much emphasis is put on sequel bating or cliffhanger endings, the film smartly avoids this. The performances are all excellent. Jeff Bridges has been nominated 6 times for an Academy Award (winning the Best Actor Oscar for Crazy Heart) and he just might be in line for his 7th nomination (and 2nd win) here. His Texas Ranger character is just one fascinating, wonderful character. Here he steals the show as the senior Texas ranger, who's sly sense of humor with his Indian partner (a fabulous Gil Birmingham) & skill to put things together & get to the criminals, is delightful. Bridges gets his character spot-on & proves once again, that he's among the greatest we've ever had. Chris Pine & Ben Foster are in top-form. Pine is a revelation, delivering a mature, restrained performance, while Foster, an actor whose potential isn't new to know, continues to astonish, with his enviable talent for playing unpredictable, unlikable characters. Also, the on-screen chemistry between Pine & Foster, appears real & affecting. On the whole, 'Hell or High Water' is a terrific film that offers a solid story that is sharply written, expertly directed & very strongly acted. Must Watch!",

            "content": "A distinctive worldview triumphs over worn-down storytelling tropes any day of the week. Hell or High Water isn't an innovative, twisty piece of storytelling, but it has an eye for its rural Texas setting that sets it apart, populating it with interesting characters top-to-bottom and with a political sensibility that it neither condemns nor condones, but sympathises with. It paints rural Texas as reliving it's days as the Wild West, abandoned by the country as a whole, a place where most folks carry weapons to settle their own disputes. It's hard for me, a Canadian who hasn't seen any of Texas outside of the Dallas airport, to say how close to the truth this is, but it's specificity creates a vivid world. When someone whose car choice clashes with the idea of the world being somewhat run-down enters the frame, its as a prelude to sudden violence when they mess with the wrong locals. The people here aren't villains, but they don't react well to being antagonised either.\n\nHell or High Water has a fairly classic setup, following two sets of partners. Brothers Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) are taking up bank robbery to make some quick cash.  Texas Rangers Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) are on their tail. There's no big twist behind this setup. Hamilton is even a couple weeks from retirement. But it's used to great effect to examine how the plight of the working class has left a vacuum for Wild West tendencies to sprout up again, while also pointing out the limitations of the analogy. The days where you can expect to rob a bank and get away with it are long gone, muses one diner patron, and the next generation won't be interested in playing cowboy, notes a rancher escorting his cattle from a brush fire. It can be heavy-handed in its musings at times, but it has clearly thought about to how to apply Western tropes to the modern world, and mostly succeeds wildly.\n\nWhat makes Hell or High Water such a standout is how it takes care to create good, distinctive characters. It's fringes are an embarrassment of riches, with numerous character actors making one-scene appearances to make tellers, waiters, and citizens pop with charisma (Dale Dickey, Kevin Rankin, and Katy Mixon all show up briefly). Bridges' Hamilton is a bit more cantankerous than world-weary, but his chemistry with Birmingham goes a long way, and his less-than-subtle and less-than-appreciated racial jesting towards his Comanche/Mexican partner comes across as more annoying-uncle than heartless-bigot. Ben Foster, about twenty pounds heavier than last seen, hopefully gets a major career boost from this, as his portrayal of Tanner avoids short-fuse stereotypes while still coming across as dangerously unstable. It takes most of its running time to set up its world and its centre foursome, and when it comes time to bring the pieces together, it does so in a way that's immensely satisfying on a visceral and narrative level. If the Old West is pretty much dead, Hell or High Water shows that the neo-Western still has blood left pumping.",

If you did not appreciate No Country for Old Men on some level or when I say, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, you're like \"say what?\" this movie might not resonate with you.  But that is because you are an idiot.  Hell or High Water is the rare kind of work that manages to feel timeless while simultaneously capturing the essence of the present.

During the robberies they take only loose cash, only what is in the teller drawers, and only from the small Mid-Texas Midland Bank branches. As the story evolves the audience learns how Tanner has been a trouble maker his whole life while Toby has been walking the straight and narrow path. So why are they doing this? We eventually find out and that is what makes this story work. Because the amount of money they are taking are small, the FBI isn't interested in finding the robbers, so the Rangers get the assignment. Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is a near retirement Ranger who is a little long in the tooth while being old time smart and is very loyal to his job. His partner, Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), is a younger man who is also Indian. The running jokes in the film is that Marcus cannot help himself about making racist and pointed jokes about Alberto's heritage. However, the audience also sees the love and respect Marcus has for Alberto. In the pursuit of the robbers the audience learns about each of the characters and the story of the ranch Tanner and Toby are trying to save. The script does a great job of defining the characters and letting the story unfold.\n\nPine is wonderful as the thoughtful smart brother who finds a way to help his family. Foster is perfect as the on-edge bad-boy brother who wants to help and support his brother. Bridges embodies the old west in the new world with this role. He's amazing. Birmingham is fantastic as Bridges' partner. A shout-out to Margret Bowman who plays a waitress in a restaurant. Her 2 minutes on the screen were brilliant. Taylor Sheridan wrote a very strong script. David Mackenzie did an excellent job of directing the actors through this story. The small Texas town feel was very well done.\n\nOverall:  This was a very entertaining film.",
